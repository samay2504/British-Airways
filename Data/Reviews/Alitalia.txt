### "The plane was dirty, very dirty"
Not Verified | This was probably one of the worst experiences I ever had with an airline. I arrived at the Rome airport with a 3 hour layover which I spent mostly waiting on a line to get my boarding pass even though I checked in online many hours before. Boarding the plane was so disorganized it was painful. The plane was dirty, very dirty. The staff was so nasty and the food was deplorable. There was nothing cold to drink and the cabin was hot. My wife has severe breathing issues. We asked several times to do something about the lack of air with no success. This flight was a 9-hour nightmare for my wife. Flight 610 from Rome to New York was a disaster. I never fly with this airline.

### "This is truly unbelievable!"
This airline is indeed a disgrace in the airline industry. I had the worst travel experience of my life in Italy. Upon arrival in Rome, we waited for 2 hours at the baggage claim area, no one did ever inform us that this airline had a strike and no one knows where our luggage was. We had to spend another 2 hours lining up at the customer service to fill out a claim form and we were told that someone will call us when they find our luggage. Ergo, we left the airline empty handed. 3 days had passed, no calls and no one was available to pick up our calls, we decided to go back to the airport. Hundreds of pieces of luggage were everywhere, anyone could freely get any luggage as no one was monitoring it. We only found one of the luggage and the other one went missing. We reported our missing bag via email since as we don't have time to line up for another couple of hours to declare our missing bag as we were headed to our our next destination. Only to be told that they are not responsible for our missing luggage, that it is our responsibility to report it to the police. We were really shocked on how these people handle this situation - as if they are really used to this kind of situation. Their defense is ignore complaints or concerns like there's nothing wrong. The missing bag is not fault of our own! Their crew went on strike, their passengers are innocent with what's going on with their company. It's not fair that they dragged us with their misery and screw up our holiday just like that. As soon as I came back home after our vacation, I immediately called their customer service, their agents were just hanging up on me whenever they hear the purpose of my call. This is truly unbelievable! Until now, no one hasn't gotten back to us about the status of our missing luggage.

### "this happens only with Alitalia!"
A terrible experience. A disgrace. From the wifi not working (not as advertised) to the lack of service on flight (for over 9 hours we were left without drinks, no juices nor any other drink was served except for water that you had to get up and go ask for) to the 2 hostesses at the check-in making sexist comments about my husband being 20 years older than me. They literally gossiped in my face in Italian while checking my documents unaware that I speak Italian too. Needless to say, this happens only with Alitalia!

### "horrible example to set as a company"
Not Verified |  Will never fly Alitalia again - first they send me a message to check in and two hours later they email me to say the flight was cancelled. Not even 24 hours before the scheduled flight. They provided no alternative flights, only a request for reimbursement. Who knows how long that will take to finalize, in the meantime I'm at a resort scrambling to reschedule it for the same day with Alitalia - I find a flight out (not easy to do when you're on the island of Cagliari, and Alitalia is the only airline servicing Cagliari from Fiumicino airport in Rome) and pay for that one too, have to make it a round trip because the website doesn't per me choose just one-way. So I get that confirmation by email and think crisis averted, but 15 minutes later I receive another email from Alitalia cancelling that reservation too! I go online to see what is going on with the company, and apparently they're planning to strike two days after my scheduled flight. I call both customer service numbers and they don't answer, then the call gets disconnected, what utter hell they put their customers through without so much as an explanation, or a flight alternative! Never again will I use them, horrible example to set as a company.

### "No service at all"
Not Verified |  I’ve never seen such a bad company. Rude people. No service at all. They lost my luggage. Well it has been on "delivery" for the last 2 days…. Terrible choice

### "They are chaotic, rude"
Not Verified |  Worst airline experience of my life. Alitalia workers were on strike when we landed in Rome from Olbia, Sardinia, and no one had bothered to tell passengers before we checked our bags to embark. We were told we could not have our luggage back due to the strike, and that it would be sitting on the tarmac for days. We had a flight home to Toronto the following day and did not have days to wait for our luggage. The staff was incredibly rude and unconcerned with the situation they had imposed on their customers. We have ZERO faith we will ever see our luggage again, which almost a week later is still sitting at Fiumicino airport with no response from Alitalia to my emailed inquiries about when we will have them returned to us or receive reimbursement for the lost items. They are chaotic, rude, and will not be accountable for any costs they impose on you.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever! First they canceled our flight (no email to let us know ahead of time) they let us know when we were in the airport, Gladly we could change our flight, I saw a customer service not using a mask during a pandemic, they never asked us for COVID test during a pandemic, my passport last name and my married last were not the same and they made a huge deal about it and they would not let us get in the plane until I show a marriage certificate. Let alone I needed help and all the stuff and customer service looked at me like they don’t work there and pretty stressful experience.

### "rude staff and terrible customer service"
We flew from Brindisi to Rome, service was trash everyone there is on a power trip, no customer service skills at all. Very rude. Then Rome to NY, the flight was fine, but they didn't pay Delta for our connecting flight to Atlanta. Delta found our name in the system but said the spots were only reserved and basically Alitalia owed them money, to actually book the flight. We didn’t find this out till we got to NY because none of the service desks/ppl at the gate were able to print us our ticket in Rome or brindisi and didn’t say why. So we get to NY Find this out and end up missing our flight. We’re still on the phone with the airline on hold to get this sorted out. I’m very disappointed with my overall experience with this airline. Unreliable airline and rude people working for them. These are only the issues we had on the way back home to ATL. We had issues otw to Rome too- again rude staff and terrible customer service.

### "the worst airline ever!"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline ever! Starting with a website that is sooo Not user friendly. To the extremely rude and unprofessional staff on the phone and in the airport. Nothing like waiting to check in and only 2 people working the counter while 6 people stand around talking to one another’s door there’s about 60 people on line. Lazy doesn’t even cover how these people acted! The food on the plane was awful! You could only have water to drink - the food was served prison style. No one smiled or even pretended to be happy, you felt like they were doing you a favor just being there. They picked up the trays of uneaten food and that was the last you saw of these miserable people. I did ask why they weren’t serving and soft drinks I was told it was due to COVID restrictions which I found out was false. The inflight entertainment was a joke 9 hours of flying with movies from 1990. Never again will I fly Alitalia.

### "Very rude and not helpful"
Not Verified |  Very bad airline, I cancelled my trip in June 2020, they gave me a voucher to use in Europe only and never told me I had it, it only lasted for 6 months then it expired. I found out myself when I called. I couldn't use the voucher credit as travel in Australia is banned and we are in Lockdown. They wouldn't extend but can apply refund only for the tax part of the ticket. So I lost all the money for my ticket. Can only get a tiny bit back. But when I call them in Italy they are very rude they hang up when I asked them to repeat what they said. Very rude and not helpful and greedy to keep peoples money. Absolutely horrible. Will never book with them again.

### "they have horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Alitalia cancelled my flight, replaced my ticket with a flight with only half the itinerary, which I obviously cancelled, and now I'm still waiting on my refund 4 months later! The worst is that they have horrible customer service, I wait for hours on the phone, until someone simply hangs up on me. This happened at least five times. I will never fly them again.

### "unreliable, disrespectful to customers"
To me, this is the worst European air company: unreliable, disrespectful to customers and finally, a real fraud. Last year, Alitalia canceled my flight from Bologna to Palermo (via Roma) without any replacement offers. I completed a form required by Alitalia for a refund and 11/20/20 they sent me email, that Alitalia issued a refund to my credit card account for e-ticket. However, this refund was never sent to my Bank. I checked with the Bank a couple of times and then, sent email to Alitalia customer service. In response, I immediately got auto-reply email requiring calling their USA customer service. I called Alitalia “USA customer service”, in fact located in Tirana, Albania. They told me that I need to wait for 90 days because there are too many refunds. In 4 months I sent a new email and got the same auto-reply. Btw, I've never got any other emails from them - only auto-replies, which were sent from "no-reply" address I called again to “USA” customer service. This time, a representative assured me that a refund will be sent in 72 hours and he’ll call me about this. As I expected, there were no refund and no call. In a couple of weeks, I sent another email, got one more auto-reply and called to Albanian (means USA!) Alitalia customer service. This time, a representative listened to my long boring story and just hung up on me. During last year, as many of us, I’ve experienced a number of flight cancellations. All American and European air companies refunded their cancelled flights, including low-cost ones (like Vueling), but only Alitalia did not fulfill its obligations. This is why Alitalia is to me the worst European air company: unreliable, disrespectful to customers and finally, a real fraud. Definitely, I’ll try my best never to use Alitalia and do not recommend this company to any travelers.

### "struggling trying to find ticket"
I booked 3 tickets in March 2021 on Alitalia for trip in July 2021 to Cairo via Rome. In June 11th I learned that the airline decided to cancel my the flight from Washington to Rome due to COVID19 as they stated without notifying me not until a friend of mine who's flying on the same flight told me about receiving an email indicating the cancelation. Called customer service, they offer me options : either I pay $1600- $4000 per ticket to change my flight to New York-Rome-Cairo or they can refund me my money back. What's more interesting that they operate flights back from Cairo-Rome-Washington. I guess that COVID19 only works on the flights from Washington to Rome but not on the flight back or on flights from New York. Now I am struggling trying to find tickets to my destination as I am very close to my trip and all the prices went up.

### "refusing to give me a refund"
Not Verified |  I booked a trip to Europe with Alitalia through my credit card for May 2020 before COVID-19 was an issue. I bought travel insurance in case I had to cancel the trip for any reason. Once COVID-19 started escalating, I had to cancel my trip. I am an essential worker and couldn't leave the US or else I wouldn't be allowed back on some job sites. The credit card company told me the only way to get a refund is by talking directly to the airline, but I haven't been able to get anywhere with Alitalia. What is the point of buying traveler's insurance if not for instances like this? They are not allowing me to rebook the trip and are also refusing to give me a refund, so they basically ate my money. I am very dissatisfied with the customer service at Alitalia and will never recommend them to anyone who is planning a trip to Europe. This is a helpless situation, and they are taking full advantage of it. Even one star is too much to give to them.

### "don't offer a glass of water"
They don't offer a glass of water. The staff didn't greet me on boarding my flight or when the flight landed, the staff just disappeared.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
London to Rome return. Not a good experience. Because of Covid-19 restrictions, everything is an excuse for not comply. Customer service "does not exist", ground and cabin staff service are very poor, and often staff is impolite. Quality of food and drinks on board is despicable. I do not recommend this airline for short/medium haul flights.

### "customer service is the worst"
On 14 July, 2020 they informed me by email that the return leg of a flight had been cancelled. The email said that if I wanted to reschedule the trip I had to call certain numbers or go on the website for other options. The website included reimbursement as an option, but the Alitalia email informing me of the cancellation had a booking number which the website did not recognise. The electronic ticket number gave no joy either as, for some reason, Alitalia generated different ticket numbers for this journey - and so I just couldn't be sure that the request had to be recognised. The website is full of glitches and is generally frustrating to use. Having wasted quite a bit of time on the website, I had no option but to get on their "helpline" which, I knew from various previous experiences, is a misnomer. I called several times, was put on hold for very long periods and then cut off and, when I was lucky enough to be transferred to an operator, that person cut me off without offering any assistance. A few weeks on, I still have no idea if my ticket will be reimbursed and have now wasted hours on this matter. Unfortunately, this is not a covid-related development - this is the kind of service I have experienced with Alitalia for many years. Unfortunately, I often have no option but to fly with them. The in-flight experience with Alitalia is no worse than with a budget airline, but their customer service - through both the website and the call centre - is the worst I know. With all the covid uncertainty, these services are more important than ever as passengers are more likely than before to have to re-book or cancel flights. Avoid Alitalia if you can.

### "expect this flight to be cancelled"
London to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. I have not flown yet, my flight is next weekend and want to know why my flight has not been cancelled? My flight transits through Rome and Abu Dhabi before landing in Melbourne. Rome is in lockdown due to COVID-19 and the UAE has closed it's borders meaning you can't transit through Abu Dhabi anymore. Furthermore, the FCO has advised against all but essential travel so this is utterly baffling! I am not happy as I expect this flight to be cancelled and given a full refund.

### "Staff was unprofessional"
Tokyo to Rome. The airplane was dirty and poorly maintained. Me and my neighbor had broken seats and our screens were small and not functioning properly. Staff was unprofessional. Chatting loudly with each other throughout the flight, even during the service. As I move to the back of the plane to get something to drink, they were sitting there having their loud conversation and minding their own business. No one asked me if I needed something.

### "comfortable seats and good airplane"
Not Verified |  Buenos Aires to Rome. Great shame that comfortable seats and good airplane were let down by dismal food and undrinkable coffee. Toilet facilities used by passengers strolling through from other cabin sections unchallenged. Check in at Buenos Aires disorganised and made to wait for an hour. It really would not take much management to improve it.

### "Poor customer service"
London to Rome. We came very Early. In fact came in 4 hrs. At the airport and was the first few early passengers. The staff asked us to gave up our carry on luggage saying it was a full flight and gave us a zone 1 assignment for boarding. The flight was delayed, and at boarding they didn't follow The zoning assignment. Very disappointed. Poor customer service.

### "Still no refund for my money"
Rome to Prague. On September 15, 2019, we bought 2 tickets on the airline's website for January 15, 2020 from Rome to Prague. November 13, 2019 by mail we received a message that our flight was canceled We contacted the contact center, where we were asked to purchase tickets for another flight with an additional fee. The operator did not warn us that the new flight is also joint and there are no clear agreements with the partner Czech airlines and sold us a new ticket. As a result, we paid another money and received a confirmation email for flight AZ7546 on January 15, departing at 14-50 However, on December 6, I again received a letter that our flight was canceled. When I called the contact center, I communicated with an operator. She told me that the flight at 14-50 does not fly. To my objection that the flight on 15.01 at 15-15, for which we originally purchased tickets, exists on the website of Czech airlines (indicated that together with Alitalia), the operator replied that our flight on this flight is not possible. There are no other direct flights on January 15 As a result, I had to issue a refund. The operator assured me that they will issue a refund immediately, within 3 banking days I will receive money on the card. How could you sell tickets when there are no clear agreements with the partner airline? Why didn't I get a refund and buy a ticket from Czech airlines for the flight I need when I canceled my first flight? It has been more than two months since the ticket refund was issued at the contact center. Still no refund for my money.

### "friendly, polite and helpful"
Not Verified |  Bologna to Sao Paulo return via Rome. Every flight on time, the planes were clean and tidy. It's the first time i experienced the premium economy and i have to say that the value for money is great, mostly for a 12 hours flight. Really nice legroom and seat inclination. IFE poor as always, they shouldn update it! Cabin crew, friendly, polite and helpful .. special mention to the cabin crew AZ675 on 05/02/20. I appreciated the welcome cocktail, but is not possible to serve it in a plastic cup. Food really good, the best food you can find on a plane! No wifi on the plane.

### "sky priority boarding not respected"
Not Verified |  Rome to Brindisi. In Brindisi and in Rome, sky priority boarding is not respected when passenger have to be transported by bus from the airport to the aircraft. On contrary, in the airport of Verona, once sky priority passengers are in the bus they are in a segregated area from the rest of the passengers and once the bus reach the aircraft first the bus doors of the area where sky priority passengers are segregated and so they can board first. It is advised that similar practice is implemented in other airports where Alitalia operates.

### "comfortable and relaxing trip"
Rome to Warsaw. Very comfortable and relaxing trip, I arrived in Warsaw a few minutes early. Clean plane, very nice on-board staff offered us snacks and drinks. I will travel again with Alitalia.

### "seats were so uncomfortable"
Rome to JFK, New York on 1/3/20. We sat in Row 26. The seating configuration was 2-4-2. We had the four middle seats. Completely lacking on this flight was comfort, even a minimal amount was not to be found. The flight almost had to be turned around within 15 minutes of take-off due to a loud verbal altercation between a family siting in Row 26 behind us and the passengers seated behind them in Row 27 - all because of reclining seats and absolutely no room because of reclining seats. The aisles were also so narrow that it was virtually impossible for 2 people to pass each other in the aisle. The seats were so uncomfortable that not even the arm rests fully raised to the vertical position. I have never experienced seats before where the arms did not fully raise to a vertical position. The food was poor on this 8 hour flight. One meal was lasagne and the second meal or snack was some sort of pizza that was rolled like a burrito, I could not ea that. The crew was not exceptionally friendly. They were mostly missing during the flight when not serving the meals and were congregating at the back of the plane. Even though this was a daylight flight, we took off 2.35 pm Rome time, the lights in the cabin were turned off early in the flight. Te movie selection was minimal and not very good.

### "The trip was a fail"
Washington to Rome. The trip was a fail because my passport expires within the three months needed to enter Rome (mistake on me) but my issue is after you have processed my passport and then printed my boarding pass they still allowed me to pay for bags when it should have been flagged that I wouldn’t be able to fly. I’m at the gate and the attendant looks at my passport and says “you aren’t valid”. Ok so will my baggage fee be refunded, no. This is definitely unfair. Contacting the customer support team was a good lesson learned that all support staff are not created equally. These guys should have given my money back at the least but such is life. Hopefully they get better and it’s true you get what you pay for (sometimes).

### "the seats are narrow"
Not Verified |  Rome to Los Angeles was the worst flight experience I’ve had. The first problems occurred when we tried to check in online, with Alitalia’s website it took over 3 hours just to check in and print boarding passes. I tried to to call Customer Service for help, to no avail. Onboard the seats are narrow, and there’s no leg room. The passenger in front of me kept trying to recline his seat, which almost placed his head in my lap and made it nearly impossible to watch a movie, which may or may not have been a good thing because their inflight entertainment leaves a lot to be desired. The movie screen is only about 4” X 6”, and my entertainment system continually crashed. We rarely saw flight attendants throughout the flight and even if you pressed the call button, no one came. The meals/snacks were less than mediocre. The one snack we received was a tuna salad sandwich. When I asked if they had any other sandwich choice, the flight attendant asked if I had requested a special meal due to food allergies. When I told her no, she went and got me 2 small packets of their crackers. Beverage service was lacking, twice I asked for a glass of water, I never received it. About 2 hours into the flight, I used the bathroom, only to find less than 1/4 roll of toilet paper sitting on the sink counter.

### "There is zero leg room"
Never been to Italy before, first time to write a review before take off! It’s all about the leg room. I am already in a lot of discomfort and we haven’t even taken off. There is zero leg room. I am worried that if the passenger in front reclined by even an inch, I will suffer an untimely death. I really should have done my homework, but as this is the National carrier etc, I assumed it would be the best.

### "overcharged us for the bags"
I bought an Alitalia ticket and I called and confirmed with Alitalia customer service that economy tickets included a checked bag. The customer service representative confirmed that I had a checked bag. When I arrived at the airport, they refused to check my bag unless I paid $60 each way. Obviously, it was too late at that point to pack a carry-on so I was forced to pay an extra $240 dollars ($120 round trip for myself and my boyfriend) for our bags. They told me I had a "light" ticket, but it didn't say that on my ticket. They said that economy tickets included a bag, but light tickets did not. Alitalia overcharged us for the bags. I contacted them after the incident on September 20, 2019, and the automated email noted that they would respond to us within 30 days. It's now 46 days later and I'm still waiting for a resolution.

### "super-narrow seats"
Rome to New York. No legroom, super-narrow seats, truly awful food and indifferent flight attendants. Although, The contrast with our flight from JFK to PDX on Delta (also economy) was practically decadent in comparison.

### "no smile or interaction"
I flew Alitalia return Rome to Delhi return in business class and the on-time performance was perfect. On the DEL-FCO flight we landed 15 minute ahead of schedule after leaving DEL airport on the exact scheduled time. When entering the aircraft the steward did not great us, did not smile, did not look at the boarding pass to show me my seat. Bins were occupied by blankets and needed to ask a stewardess to remove them, which she did with an accusing expression as if it was my fault that the blankets were there. The food was heralded as inspired by a famous restaurant, but in reality was not. When serving the meal,  crew was polite, but no smile or interaction to me. During the night nobody came through the cabin to offer a glass of water or a snack. The galley had a bottle of water and Coca Cola, but no snacks. The water was served in a plastic beaker. Before landing, none of the crew asked if we had had a pleasant flight. When leaving the aircraft, no pleasantries, no smile to me.

### "cabin crew was very nice"
2hr flight from Tel Aviv to Athens. Basic and not well maintain Airbus, seats are very tight I almost couldn't fit in ( im 1.87M). The cabin crew was very nice and suggested me to move into Exit without any payment. I didn't ask that- they offer this so well done.

### "missed our connection to Boston"
Catania to Boston via Rome. At Catania Airport when we were informed our flight was cancelled but not given a reason. One person at the service desk said it was the weather-other flights were leaving and arriving, others said it was a transport strike- We needed a written reason to fullfil the terms of our travel insurance. A service person said we could get the answer on line. He tried but could not produce a website with the answer. We were bused from Catania 1.5 hrs to Comiso Airport - we never received new tickets and were simply boarded on a flight to Rome. We missed our connection to Boston and were bused to a 3rd rate hotel in suburban Rome, offered a dinner of pasta and pork (which we don't eat) and told to be up at 6 am the next day for a flight leaving for Boston at 10:55 am. Breakfast was a bag with a bottle of water, dried cracker, stale croissant, and juice box. The flight to Boston was horrendous. The meal choicewas gone by the time the attendent came by - she offered me her meal which was very kind. The entertainment offerings were horrible and for me the system didn't work and wifi never worked. When I checked on several flight tracker sites AZ 1724 was listed as departing from Catania!

### "customer support team was pathetic"
Belgrade to New Delhi via Rome. 7th October, 2019 was my birthday. And it was the worst birthday of my life. Thanks to Alitalia's customer service support staffs. I was supposed to travel from Belgrade (AZ591) to New Delhi (AZ770) via Rome. The first flight was delayed by almost an hour as a result missed the next flight to Delhi. Nobody in Rome was willing to help. After running from pillar to post finally found someone who took all the time in the world (at least 2 hours) to inform that next flight is after 24 hours. No facility was provided except for two meal coupons. No accommodation, no visa, no lounge access. Stranded with no facilities and no luggage and was suggested to sleep on seats and survive 24 hours in cold. Surprised to see this service especially when name of Etihad is associated. I had a connecting train from Delhi next morning which I missed. I am still figuring out how to do further journey as I am not able to secure any ticket now. Their customer support team was pathetic in Rome. Sorry to use such strong word. But they cannot communicate. Their knowledge is limited. And on top of everything I did not find them humane. Especially in hospitality sectors these features are so much needed. I never thought this is the way they will compensate their customers by adding more misery to their suffering for which they are responsible in the first place.

### "Very disappointed"
I flew from Moscow to Palermo, with a transfer in Milan on October 3, flight number AZ7027. Upon arrival in Palermo, my luggage was lost. I contacted the Lost and Found, the staff promised me that they would deliver my luggage to the hotel early in the morning of October 4th. As a result, my luggage was delivered only in the evening at 8 o’clock! All this time I had to be in discomfort and without the basic hygiene products that your company had to offer. Then on October 5, my flight was again your company flight number AZ1790 with a transfer in Milan. At check-in, I asked you to deliver my luggage directly to Moscow. An employee of your company began to claim that I need to wait a day at Milan airport! When my stopover duration was to be only 1 hour 10 minutes. It was her mistake, she did not give me a boarding pass to Moscow and sent my luggage only to Milan. She scared me very much and made me nervous! Before flying to Milan, other airport employees announced me and said that there was a mistake and they gave me a boarding pass to Moscow. I asked several times, was my baggage redirected to Moscow? They claimed that yes, everything is fine. You will receive your luggage in Moscow. Then when I arrived in Moscow, my luggage was lost again. It's just awful and this is the first time I've met so much disgusting service! As a result, I was able to get my luggage on October 7th! Very disappointed and will never use it again. Ruined my vacation.

### "denied her assistance"
I booked a return flight to my mum who is unable to walk long distance. I arranged assistance at the airport and into the aircraft to help her to move during her trip. This was planned long time in advance. She was back from her journey and she did not have any issues in the other flights until she arrived at Verona airport where they denied her assistance and they charged her extra fee. Assistance was free and she did not pay in all the other trips. Furthermore despite her showing her e-ticket to the check in desk where it was clearly written that assistance and luggage were included they charged for it as well. She was travelling alone and it was a really unpleasant and unacceptable experience. I strongly recommend not to take any connection to Verona.

### "does not care about its passengers"
August 28, 2019, I was traveling with my disabled stepmother and a child with scoliosis from Athens, Greece to Malta (AZ 717) with a change in Rome (flight AZ 884). The flight from Athens to Rome was delayed 2 hours and as a result, we missed our connection flight (AZ884) from Rome to Malta and had to spend 9 hours 40 minutes in Rome instead of 2 hours 25 minutes. The explanation I got when I complained about such a huge unexpected layover in Rome from Alitalia was: “Our records show flight AZ717 was delayed due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft due to crew rest. Under EU Regulation EC 261/2004 (Art. 5.3 and Recital 14) the carrier does not assume liability when flights are delayed due to “extraordinary circumstances”. What extraordinary circumstances? Earthquake? Tornado? Wind? Rain “cats and dogs” so the other Alitalia flight was so delayed that the crew had to rest? I do not recall any of the above-mentioned disasters happening. Or it is just a conspiracy way to trick customer for not reimbursing/helping/accommodating them when most likely the delay happened because of the technical issues with the planes and it is Alitalia fault for which they should answer? Continuation: Upon arrival to Rome We we not offered help for a disabled person (it is quite difficult to sit in the chair for 9 hours 40 min), neither phone call, no food coupons as required by Under EU Regulation EC 261/2004 (Art. 5.3 and Recital 14), though we talked to the representatives in the disabled "lounge" upon arrival in Rome asking what we could be offered to help us go through the 9 hours plus of the delay (Just to mention, I paid higher price for the tickets to spend as little time during the layover as possible and ended up with 9 hours). To help my child with scoliosis and disabled stepmother go though this horrible not planned delay I purchased 2 entry passes (50.00 USD each) to the business class lounge assuming that would solve two problems: food and provide comfort in seating/laying flat in the lounge for two sick persons. If I were to go to the restaurants to feed all three of us I am sure during 9 hours 40 minutes layover we will spend way more then 100.00 combined (and I do not even ask to reimburse anything for myself). Of course, I complained about the delay and applied for 100.00 USD paid for the 2 passes (only 2, not 3). And here is the answer I received from Alitalia: "depending on the length of the delay, the airline is required to provide the necessary care and assistance as phone call, meals and refreshments, or reimburse the expenses for meals and beverages based on the relevant receipts. However, we regret to advise that the complimentary access to VIP lounges is not subject to this provision, therefore we are not able to refund the lounge access you purchased at Rome airport”. Looks like Alitalia does not care about its passengers at all only about filling its pockets. Next: Before the flight In Athens I tried to pay for excess weight online but the Alitalia website got frozen all the time when I got to the point when I was supposed to pay. I was constantly trying for a few hours but could not pay the internet price 28.00 USD per bag versus what I had to pay in the airport 50 USD.

### "lost our luggage for days"
Catania to Milan. My sister and I won't use Alitalia never again, for sure. We paid GBP 78 for our luggage allowance, however, they lost our luggage for days. My sister, that was visiting me in London, had to fly back to Buenos Aires without her original luggage and belongings. She had to buy new suitcase + basic things to be able to come back and, despite all these expenses generated and documented, they have denied her any compensation. Absolutely disrespectful, never again for us.

### "no response after 5 days"
I booked an Alitalia Flight from Genoa to Johannesburg for Monday 9th September. Flying out at 19:00 and arriving Johannesburg 9:00 on Tuesday 10th. While checking in for my first flight at 17:00 I received a mail that my flight from Rome to Johannesburg  had been cancelled and I would be rescheduled on a flight the following morning. At the customer service desk I was instructed to request a refund for my ticket. Once arriving in Rome I asked at customer service and was told I could only do this online. The following morning I was put on a 9:00 flight to JHB which was then again delayed for another 1.5hrs. I arrived in JHB at 20:00 on the 10th so an entire day of work lost. I also received an email instructing me to request a refund for my cancelled flight. The following day I called the Alitalia call center for South Africa, they informed me that I had to email [email protected] which I did, twice and I have had no response after 5 days. This is the third flight cancellation that I have experienced with Alitalia.

### "seats were a lot more comfortable"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Rome. The best part about taking the premium economy with Alitalia is the Priority Check-in and also the distinct compartment that separates the 18 seats from Economy and Business. It also has its own toilet although on our flight it was out of order. The seats were also a lot more comfortable than standard economy. After those advantages the rest was not much better than standard economy. The food service was ho-hum and there was no liquor available even on a trans Atlantic flight. The flight attendants were adequate in terms of attentiveness but no more. The priority check-in, Priority baggage handling and comfortable seats were worth the added cost.

### "I recommend this airline"
Geneva to Rome. Adorable personnel, helpful, I recommend this airline, my flight was cancelled one day ago and they allowed me to the lounge to wait, offered me breakfast and lunch.

### "suitcase was tampered with"
Not Verified |  Dusseldorf to Delhi via Rome. Upon arrival to Delhi, I was told my baggage was not boarded on the plane. They said it will be delivered by next flight. Next day, they said the baggage is misplaced or lost. Asked for me to fill long forms and give proofs of my residence, work etc. In the mean time I had to buy basic clothes and toiletries (as nothing was offered by the airline). However 8 days later, I finally received my baggage but the locks were broken, the suitcase was tampered with and some items missing. It was a gross case of negligence and mishandling. In order to compensate the airline offered a meager sum of €100 euros. Would never fly again and would not recommend it.

### "I've found decent service"
Not Verified |  Milan to Cagliari. Wasn't taking an Alitalia flight for years, and was expecting the worse. Funny enough, I've found decent service and reasonably clean aircraft, with good knee space. Flight attendants looked stressed, but didn't disappoint. Surely will choose Alitalia  again, at least for short range flights.

### "Poor staff service"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Johannesburg via Rome. Where does one begin? Send delay information emails and confirmation after it already happened. Poor staff service, very unfriendly. No support to single mothers with children, can't even get receive a bottle of water on request. Everything asked seems to be too much of a hassle or inconvenience for the staff. Refuse to speak another language to some customers while gladly speak the same language to other customers. Will never fly with Alitalia again. Our friends warned us about the shocking service and thought it can't be so bad, but it's very bad indeed.

### "would not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Our group of four took Alitalia from Chicago to Rome on 06/26/2019 and returned to Chicago 07/03/2019. We had a flight that left Chicago at 3:30 p.m. Once we took off the employees came around and gave us some food that was ok. By 5:30p.m. the employees told the passengers to pull down the window shades so the inside of the plane was dark. I believe their intent was to make everyone go to sleep and not bother the staff during the flight. I do not go to sleep at 5:30 in the afternoon and did not sleep during any of the flight! The staff did not come through the plane to check on passengers for hours during the flight and I had to go search for one of them to get a drink of water. I think the staff went to sleep during the flight. On the way back to Chicago we left Rome at 9:30 a.m. and again were told to pull down the shades. While this may work well for people who want to sleep during the day I believe it was again done so the steward and stewardess could ignore the passengers. When the staff did come through the airplane with what they called food they were rude and curt if any of the passengers wanted to ask any questions about the "food". Some of the passengers are allergic to various ingredients and the airline employees did not show any interest in answering questions about the food. I would not recommend this airline.

### "My luggage was lost"
The worst airline ever. My luggage was lost on July 27. July 29 they called me to tell me they found my luggage and will ship to me. They never shipped but closed the file. Since then I have called and emailed and they have yet to reopen file which means my luggage will not be sent and no-one will look for it if its lost.

### "very different flight experiences"
Bari to London via Rome and had 2 very different flight experiences. I booked my flights several months ahead of travel for my summer holiday and found the Alitalia site to be very efficient and user friendly. Alitalia emailed me a reminder to check-in online and so that side of things proved to be impressive and reliable. Check-in at Bari was quick and the gentleman who checked me in made pleasant small talk and was very polite. The flight from Bari to Rome was on an A320, the aircraft was clean and the interior well presented. Boarding was well managed and the flight departed slightly early and reached Rome 10 mins ahead of schedule. During this short flight the friendly and well turned out crew served drinks and were a great credit to their company. Disembarkation was most efficient and orderly. I transferred from the domestic terminal to terminal E for the flight to London. This flight was on a clearly older A320. Boarding was not orderly as too many passengers had far too much hand luggage. The flight was delayed for over 90 minutes on the runway and no announcements were made by the captain at all. Most of the cabin crew disappeared and left one lady to try and answer questions from worried passengers. One passenger was told that storms over London had caused the delay and another person said there was power failure at Heathrow. This was all hearsay and not at all beneficial to passengers. I noted how a captain from another airline was treated like a king by the cabin crew. He was placed by the emergency seat and another passenger moved to enable this. Two Mexican ladies sat next to me and were concerned about missing their flight to Mexico City. The same cabin crew member who fussed over the captain waved her hands at the Mexicans and said it was not her job to know about connecting flights. During this flight a small drink was served and a snack consisting of a micro packet of biscuits. When I arrived at Heathrow I found that my case had been broken. I had to find a place to report this and was assisted by a young man who was clearly not coping well. Apparently quite a few bags on the flight did not even arrive in London. I shall hesitate to use Alitalia for international flights but should I  need a domestic flight, I shall consider them! The poor communication was a great concern and the indifferent staff on the Rome to London flight were a cause for concern.

### "not recommend this airline"
Cairo to New York via Rome. I would not recommend this airline, they are apart of the sky team alliance and I purchase my ticket through delta but feel as though I’ve been ripped off. The employees of this airline is rude both on the plane and at the gate.

### "not recommend this airline"
New York to Athens via Rome. There was an elderly man in front of us with a cane and needed help, as he boarded none of the stewardess bothered to look at him. The crew did not greet us as we entered the airplane, did not help anybody on the plane, did not crack one smile. When food was served it was basically tossed at us. Later as the lights went out I pressed the call button and asked for water. It took her 15 minutes to get me a glass of water. I would not recommend this airline.

### "disappointed in the service"
Munich to Pisa via Rome. I found out there is a strike at my layover airport. I understand there is nothing you can do immediately to prevent strikes. But how do I only find out my connection takes twice as long when I check in? With no reason given at all? Ok there is a note in the email that notifies me about cancelled flights with no further information to talk to a ticketing officer where one can ask for passenger rights. Thus i explain my situation to random alitalia employees to find it. After half an hour later I am at an empty booth. Other airport empoyees explain me where the real booth is and that i should ask for a ticket. After half an hour my number is called. I go there, they explain me to wait in line because the system does not work right now. But the line does not move at all since some passengers are arriving with Alitalia employees to be injected at the front of the line. Finally after 1:30 hours later i can explain my situation to the person i have been referred to countless times. I ask her about the compensation policy for delayed flights and my passenger rights, yet she only refers me to the website. After multiple requests she writes down the address of the website in my notebook. If this is truly the only way to file complaints, I would have expected this to be communicated beforehand and not 2h after I spoke with the first Alitalia ground personnel about the matter. I am seriously disappointed in the service you are providing, your communication policy and how you are handling complaints.

### "made us stand in line for hours"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Beirut via Rome. A sky priority platinum member story: Not only we were delayed on all the segments, not enough that our flight was delayed and we missed the connection, They made us stand in line for hours without any and when arrived to role they made us stand up in line for another hour, I was informed that it's better and safer to keep my luggage with them and that it's 100% it will arrive to destination, when asked for it still they said I'll have to wait for 2 hours for them to bring it so I chose to follow their direction and leave it with them, no surprise here the luggage was not sent but also lost. The night In Rome they sent me to a hotel. After an hour of waiting in line the hotel tells me that the airline sent them another memo and that they will send me to another hotel. We landed at 12 midnight and I reached my room at 4 am after all the hassle. The next morning flight was delayed again 1 hour,  and of course no luggage. Mean, unethical, careless, and notorious for bad service.

### "Seat pitch is good"
Flew Rome to Bari roundtrip. FCO-BRI: Used Kiosk check-in without problem. Upon boarding, staff screened passengers for carry-on baggage to make sure the it's within the 8-kg weight limit. And I had to pay for 1-kg overweight at 49 euro price. I was to move some contents out of my luggage into my backpack. The staff said the backpack also has weight limit. Seemed like I was destined to pay up. T1 is a mad house. The domestic (or regional) flights use the gates at tarmac level. There was hardly any place to sit down. Many people resorted to the floor. Leaning on the wall and space was a rare commodity. Flight was slight delayed as taking more time using buses to remote stands as my plane was parked at the far end. BRI-FCO: I knew I will be definitely overweight on my luggage after Greek island hopping trip. I purchased the luggage for this sector. Checked in at a Kiosk which was slow and stalled and took forever about 5 to complete. Luggage drop was not accepted as only one flight at a time. There was a flight leaving before mine so the luggage had to be dropped at a designated time. It was quick domestic hops. Beverage service on board was offered on both legs. Seat pitch is good.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  We flew from Cagliari to Milan Linate on an A320. Check in lines were long but fortunately we arrived early. Fortunately we were not charged for excess baggage. Hand luggage allowance is I believe only about 8 kilos. We left on time and the crew were very friendly. We also were served a drink and a very nice packet of crisps. In general I was pleasantly surprised by the professional, friendly crew.

### "experience was really good"
Athens to Rome. The flight was cheap so I was a little skeptic especially considering I didn't fly Alitalia since 3 years but the experience was really good and there was plenty of soft drinks and helpful cabin crew.

### "Seat was broken"
Terrible seat in premium economy. Seat was broken and wouldn’t properly recline. The main purpose I purchased premium economy was to be able to recline and sleep on my 13hr flight. I asked the attendant for help fixing the seat and she simply said she didn’t remember how to fix it and dismissed me. Movies worked but the picture quality was out of the 80s. Grainy and poor colors. Also it was a challenge to figure it out. Last year I flew EVA air to Vietnam for exactly half the price and twice the quality. It’s really no wonder Alitalia is in the brink of bankruptcy.

### "charged me extra for luggage"
Catania to Rome. Bought my ticket with window seat and checked in the night before with luggage. When I arrived at airport for baggage drop off, they charged me extra for luggage and downgraded my seat to middle all the while pretending to not understand English and refusing service. I hope others does not have to go through the same treatment.

### "Horrible customer service"
Catania to Rome. Worst airline experience I've encountered. Horrible customer service and no organization in their ticketing process. My flight was delayed and I had to go back through security to talk to a lady at the checkout counter. After waiting over an hour, I was yelled at and told to go stand in another line. Alitalia should be ashamed of their customer service and their poor management.

### "No respect for SkyTeam customers"
Not Verified |  Bucharest to Milan. No respect for SkyTeam customers, especially elite plus customers, that pay a lot in order to fly only this team! After talking to customer service you may need therapy, so never try to ask for their help. Actually avoid this company. I will surely never ever fly Alitalia again. They will even sell your ticket to a cheap company and pretend they don’t care of any status you have. Should get excluded from SkyTeam immediately. Make you pay for your luggage, seats and you don’t get any attention even as a Platinum Member! Didn’t allow lounge, with Alitalia ticket and Platinum membership!

### "They lost my luggage"
Bari to Rome. Terrible experience. They lost my luggage, then shortly before I could have claim compensation they have lost it again. Customer service was not helpful at all and always took very long on calls.

### "experience felt like pure harassment"
Catania to Tel Aviv via Rome. I booked a flight a few months in advance, with a 12 hour stopover in Rome on my way back from Catania to Tel-Aviv. On the day before my return flight, while attempting to check in online, I found out that Alitalia has changed the time of my CTA-FCO flight from the morning to the evening, thus reducing my layover in Rome to two hours. They did this a few days before the flight, without alerting me to the fact that they're changing my itinerary (my understanding is that an Airline is not allowed to change the itinerary within 14 days from the flight, and that they must notify the passenger). Since I had plans in Rome, I contacted Alitalia by phone. From here on my experience was truly unbelievable. The first representative I spoke to, told me that my original flight was canceled, and there's nothing she can do. But I had reasons to suspect that the flight was not canceled (it was possible to purchase tickets for the flight online). Since she refused to acknowledge this, I asked whether I could be placed on some other morning flight. The representative responded that she can't find any available flight. Then she told me that there is a regional problem and all morning flights from Catania are canceled - which, as I found out after the call ended, had no connection with reality. I called again, after verifying online that it's possible to book my original itinerary on the Alitalia web site. I also spoke with several colleagues who attended the same conference as me, and none of them were notified of any flight cancellations. The same representative got my call. She told me now that she simply cannot offer me my original itinerary, even though the flight was not canceled, and that the airline has the right to do this (which is incorrect). She offered me some other choices which were completely irrelevant to me, and explained to me that I must accept one of these offers. I asked to speak with a supervisor but she refused to let me do this (claiming that all supervisors are away, or in a meeting, depending on the time I asked). She also kept demanding that I check availability online once more, but as I was traveling I wasn't able to talk on the phone and access the web at the same (this, she said, was 'my problem'). After 45 minutes of futile attempts to get this representative to help me, I ended the call and called again. This time I reached another representative. This one started by repeating the incorrect claim that my original flight was canceled. But I confronted her with the fact that the flight was being sold on the Alitalia web site. She then acknowledged that the flight was not canceled, but claimed that she cannot put me on my original itinerary anyway. I insisted. After a lengthy discussion she asked that I wait (probably seeking assistance from a more senior team member), and finally placed me on the itinerary that I booked. I wasted overall an hour and a half on this, and missed several talks in the conference that I attended. By the way: there were a number of empty seats on the flight, so there was absolutely no logical incentive for refusing to put me on it. The whole experience felt like pure harassment. Seems like Alitalia representatives are simply trained to do as little as possible to assist passengers. This is either a policy of the airline, or perhaps the representative are super lazy and incompetent, and nobody in this airline cares.

### "pleasantly surprised"
Rome to Buenos Aires. I had to run to the gate as my Alitalia connecting flight from Milan arrived late (they did wait for us though). The plane cabin was relatively well maintained, IFE was working properly (even though the screens and the choice could be improved). The service was quite quick and the food quite tasty (as you would expect by an Italian airline). There's definitely room for improvement but overall I was pleasantly surprised.

### "Seats  very uncomfortable"
Mexico City to Rome. Seats were very uncomfortable. The screens didn't work during the flight. The crew didn't answer when the button was pushed to call them. I asked for gluten and lactose free meal, and my meal had lactose products which i didn't noticed and made me feel awful during the flight.

### "Alitalia has improved"
Rome to London. Historically my flights with Alitalia have never been pleasant, most frequent occurrence the lost baggage. Surprisingly, regardless of its financial position, Alitalia has improved. Flights were on time, baggage wasn't lost, and service was decent. The pre-flight auction for business class is also a great idea. Well, the lack of politeness of an Italian cabin crew, and the ridiculously narrow seat pitch are not a surprise at all.

### "not fly Alitalia again"
Barcelona to Istanbul via Rome. Check in was appalling. A customer service staff was so rude that a colleague of his came to my assistance. I could not remove my old airline tag from my check in luggage,& his reply was that it was my problem,& wouldn’t even help me, after asking him several times, & informing him that I couldn’t remove it. He refused to check in my luggage & then his colleague ignored him & helped out. I will not fly Alitalia again.

### "the rudest staff"
Not Verified |  Montenegro to Cairo via Rome. Worst airline I've ever taken and the rudest staff on and off the plane. I heard so many bad things about Alitalia before but never thought it would be this bad. After a 6 hour delay, they didn't even bother to do anything about it, no one cares. My grandma needs to be on a wheelchair and there was no assistance what so ever, in fact, after they got her a wheelchair they left her at the rome airport at a random gate without even checking where she wanted to go and they took the wheelchair away from her after we explained she couldnt move without it! They were extremely rude and impolite, and couldn't care less. Not recommended even if it is the cheapest flight available, you will be frustrated the whole time, it's not worth it at all. Huge disappointment, never flying Alitalia again.

### "Crew was extremely rude"
I took this flight from London to Delhi via Rome. Airline did not give any information about the terminal and the gate for the connection from Rome. Crew was extremely rude. Flight was delayed by 2 hours because of detour it had to take. Captain/crew did not provide any information on the delay. There was delay in baggage arrival and it was mixed with other airlines luggage. Ground staff had no information on delay.

### "kicked us to economy without any explanation"
Not Verified |  Boston to Rome (Fiumicino) with Alitalia. We paid for a premium economy seat and just 72 hours before the flight they changed the plane and kicked us to economy without any explanation. They were rude when we tried to call them and offered no help when we were very confused. When we got to the airport the checkin staff were extremely rude and just wanted us to go away. I kid you not the was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on. The crew only wanted to serve you on their schedule and woke me up to "Chicken or Beef? I never received an explanation why we were kicked out but we were partially refunded.

### "worst flight I have had"
Rome to Athens. This must be the worst flight I have ever had. One of the most uncomfortable planes I have ever been on. Rude air hostesses which where talking down to passengers and giggling all through the flight at the back of the plane. I am surprised they are still allowed to fly with such service and state of aircraft. Only positive in the whole trip was the ground staff service at transfer desk.

### "after sales is terrible"
Sao Paulo to Rome via Milan. I had no problem during the flight, but the after sales is terrible. I sent an email asking to transfer the miles to a Alitalia's partner air company and since January I got no reply from them. I tried to call Brazilian branch but they said I should send an e-mail to Alitalia and wait a reply. Now my time to request the miles has expired and I just lost it because Alitalia did not reply any of the e-mails.

### "said our bags were too big"
Rome to Athens. We took an early morning flight to save money, only brought one suitcase that met all the requirements online. Upon arrival, they said our bags were too big (they were soft so they fit in the box but they measured it using a weird machine that didn’t compact it) and charged us 90€, more than we paid for our miserable early morning tickets. We’ve never had a problem with these suitcases meeting dimensions, we’ve flown over 20 times with them on airlines with the same requirements. We’re now not going to be able to do much at our destination because they made us pay such an insane additional amount.

### "never fly Alitalia again"
Not Verified |  We booked two tickets from Munich to Rome via the Alitalia Homepage and got a direct confirmation. At the airport, we were informed by very unfriendly and slow staff that we would not be on the passenger list and Alitalia cannot transport us with the booked flight and we shall buy another ticket in an Alitalia flight 6 hrs later. The staff denied to provide contact to her boss and did not give her name. We had to book another one-way-flight on the same day with another company, spend 380€ extra. When arriving in Rome, we again contacted a service staff. She was much more friendly and informed us that Alitalia had some software problems resulting in bookings via the internet not being correctly processed internally. She promised that our costs will be reimbursed. We then contacted Alitalia to get our reimbursement. Unfortunately, although we spent much time to precisely indicate all circumstances and additional costs, Alitalia only reimbursed the 254€ for the original ticket but did not reimburse the additional costs of 380€ for the extra flight to Rome (and we had to pay another 250€ for the flight back from Rome). Furthermore, and most disappointing, Alitalia did neither give an explanation nor an excuse. We will never fly Alitalia again!

### "lost our luggage"
Barcelona to Rome. The agent made us check the weight of every single bag we had, even hand bags, we consolidated and reconsolidated, checked 3 bags and paid the extra costs for the bags and still Alitalia lost our luggage. Worst customer service, they could care less that your luggage is lost and do nothing to even try to help. How does no one know where my luggage is and why are the customer service agents so horribly trained.

### "looked like they would rather have been elsewhere"
This was my second time flying with Alitalia to Johannesburg and I have to say that the first time was better than this. The aircraft were all clean and the crew from LHR to FCO were pleasant enough. However the all male crew to Johannesburg, although not rude, tried very hard not to interact with the passengers. I saw one flight attendant smile the whole flight. It is sad that the crew all looked like they would rather have been elsewhere. During the night there was not a sign of them and compared to other airlines that really lets them down.

### "Will certainly fly again!"
Amsterdam to Athens via Rome. Alitalia currently offers by far the cheapest deals in premium segments and so I booked another roundtrip to ATH, like I did last year. The flight also offered me 60 XP at a bargain. Hard and soft product more or less same as previous flights. This time I pre booked a Seafood meal and certainly did not regret. Meal was of much better quality then the standard Pasta dishes. Alitalia offers a hotel on all segments (ATH-FCO is just 1h35). Staff friendly and lounge in ATH is very good. Sky Priority well organized. All flights on time except last flight into AMS minor delay due to heavy wind at AMS. Crew has nice new uniforms. Also in economy I noticed they still offer some basic service, a nibble and a beverage on all flights uphill 3hrs. WiFi available Will certainly fly again!

### "never fly Alitalia again"
Frankfurt to Florence via Rome. We will never fly with Alitalia again. We arrived at the airport in Germany with plenty of time to spare and got stuck in security. When I say stuck, I mean we stood in line not moving for almost an hour. We got to the gate and they would not let us in, nor would they help us rebook. This cost us $1400 to book through another flight and a hotel for the night.

### "a very comfortable way to fly"
Alitalia's Premium Economy is a very comfortable way to fly. On our recent trip from Amsterdam to Cape Town, we booked Premium Economy and - good to know - unlike others, Alitalia will put you in Business Class on connecting flights that don't have Premium Economy. A huge step up from many of the other airlines that will seat you in Economy. So those flights come with complimentary lounge access. Lounge in Amsterdam provided by KLM, which is just OK. Business class on board Alitalia is pretty standard but seats do have adjustable armrest that create a slightly wider seat, ample pitch and a little table in between seats that folds down. I was quite impressed with the catering, a traditional set up with a good pasta, salad and dessert. Service was fine. Connection in Rome is really easy as you are leaving the EU (no security). Our flight to JoBurg left on time with an early arrival. This is important because if the flight is late it will be handled at a remote stand, which easily adds 30 minutes to getting through the arrival process. Alitalia's premium economy is wonderful. Really comfy seats with great recline, quite adequate for sleeping. Avoid the first row, because leg space is really reduced there. seats are in a 2-3-2 arrangement with 2 rows on the side and 3 in the middle. Second window row is really the best. A nice amenity kit was handed out, pre departure bubbles in plastic cups. Meal service was upgraded and somewhere in between economy and business class. Proper linens, china and silverware were used. I had a great sleep on this flight. Breakfast was very basic. Service from the staff could be warmer, but nothing to get upset about. Arrival in Joburg was okay with a short wait at immigration. Alitalia sells a connection to Cape Town (which we took) on SAA, but they 'don't partner' which means if anything happens that will make you miss your connection they will point fingers to each other. We made our connection but trying to make some sort of a change in the trip was impossible because of this.

### "enjoyed our Alitalia flight"
We returned from Cape Town to Amsterdam via Johannesburg and Rome. The first sector was on SAA. Johannesburg is a tricky airport to transfer from domestic to international. Terminals are far apart and it requires re-check-in, security and passport control, then more long distance walking. Our 1H30 connecting time just got us as last passengers onto AZ's flight to Rome with minutes to spare. The club cabin on AZ's A330 is nice with incredibly comfortable, private and spacious seating. All window seats are singles, slightly staggered so some are closer to the windows then others, but all allow for good views from the windows. AZ's amenity kit is gorgeous. Proper printed menus for food and wine were handed out. Pre-departure bubbles, water and juice, international papers followed. Although AZ's pillow is of disposable quality the pillow case is beautiful and the blanket is fine too. AZ is obviously taking on-time performance seriously. All our flights left spot on time or early. Dinner started quickly after take off. Alitalia sets individual tables (no trays), this gives almost a First class feeling. Beautiful linens, glass and silverware. Dinner is a five course affair of solid quality. The pasta dish was gorgeous (and a full meal by itself). So far AZ's product is with the absolute top. The only aspect that could be better is the staff. They are so 'rough around the edges' and most interactions are 'rusty'. They are okay but not overly friendly or proactive. It seems they avoid interaction. What a pity because this created a rather 'frosty' atmosphere in the cabin. The purser did not make any effort to interact although she was constantly in the cabin with paperwork, dealing with her team as if we were not there. No welcome, 'how are you' or goodbye's from her. Sleeping on board is fine although the cabin was too hot, luckily window seats have individual vents. Seats in the middle don't so I would avoid those seats. Breakfast was rather 'Italian' with no options and sweets only. Also breakfast was served in total darkness, which I gather is not a problem for passengers (who have individual lights) but I guess not ideal for the staff. Arrival was on-time but Rome airport was it's usual mess. We enjoyed our Alitalia flight and recommend it.

### "Very old entertainment system"
Flew back to Brazil in Alitalia Business class. Short hop from LHR to FCO was nice, all good, lounge at Rome is as good as any in the world simply because its food is great! The long-haul flight back to GRU was same type of aircraft as the outbound and similarly "tired". Very old entertainment system even in Business class. I do like Alitalia's flat bed seat, I do find it very comfortable. Food was not up to scratch. The menu was quite limited and uninspiring for premium cabin. Campari was great as always. The pasta was a little burned, the fish was tiny and of poor quality. I was very disappointed as I have always raved about Alitalia's food. The flight was very uncomfortable as there was a lot of turbulence, I was unable to sleep at all. I felt the pilot could have done more, he "cruised" at the same altitude for from the third hour of the flight when in my experience others have tried to look for more comfortable reaches, maybe there were ATC considerations, I don't know, but it was a pretty horrid flight and I did feel a lack of consideration from the front.

### "getting quite tired"
So these 777 that Alitalia now fly are getting quite tired. Seats in economy are very hard. I had a "comfort" seat on the long-haul flight from Sao Paulo to Rome so I had extra leg room. I got mine for free as I am platinum with Air France, however otherwise it would have cost US$150 and consequently I imagine those that did pay would have been outraged that staff allowed people to move to vacant exit seats after take off. The meal was satisfactory and probably above average for airline food. Entertainment system very old, but a couple of good films so job done I guess. Thankfully I had the prospect of lunch in one of my favourite lounges (Rome) in the world to cheer me up as I crossed the Atlantic. The flight was cheap, for the price good value albeit even in "comfort class" not very comfortable.

### "haven't received my baggage"
Rome to Pisa. My first experience with this company was really bad. First, the flight is delayed for one hour and the second I haven't received my baggage and still waiting to be found.

### "offers basic snack service"
Berlin to Rome. I had Flying Blue points to redeem so I used them for my flight from Berlin to Rome. I was a bit apprehensive at first with Alitalia being in receivership after having been ditched by Etihad. But I proceeded anyway knowing that in the unlikely event that the airline goes belly up, I still have other options. As with most intra-European flights, Alitalia offers basic snack service on board. A drink and a snack, either sweet or salty was being served on this 2 hour flight. As I was seated in the exit row, leg space was generous. Seats were leather seats in black. Flight attendants were smartly dressed in black pant suit with scarf emblazoned with Alitalia colours.

### "does not like business travellers"
Not Verified |  I was stupid enough to booked my ticket for today’s flight from Algiers via Rome to Munich (in business class) with Alitalia. When I came to the check in counter I was forced to check in my carry on trolley because the combined weight of trolley and laptop bag was 17 kg (more than the limit of 16 kg, because I carried quite a bit of work related paper). I asked for the station manager who came and insisted I must check this in, he did not accept my to carry my laptop or some papers separately. I always travel with my trolley and laptop bag and on long trips an additional suit bag as carry on basically all the world airlines who – other than Alitalia – understand that business travellers who pay for an expensive do not like to waste their time by waiting half an hour on checked baggage to arrive. Too bad that Alitalia does not like business travellers - I certainly draw the conclusion to book my flights with other airlines in the future!

### "no smile no nothing"
Not Verified |  Rome to Belgrade. This was my first and last flight with Alitalia. I was so excited to get on this flight once we came to the airport the staff were so rude, no smile no nothing. Onboard my seat was taken by someone else and I have asked to sit next to my wife as we already booked our tickets in advance and booked our seats as well. I was told if there is more space you can move to a different seat if not then just need to stay in my current seat. we took off 1hr 45min late, seats were not comfy at all very hard and no space. The service was ok once we took off nothing special. once we were coming to a land into Belgrade the aeroplane kept on dropping and quiet a few passengers were screaming.

### "all my baggage misplaced"
Mumbai to Paris via Rome. Alitalia has pathetic customer service. I got all my baggage misplaced and getting delivered to me after 3 days. Due to their irresponsible behaviour I had to spend ~150 Euros and now when I requested them to bring my amount back, they first offer me 30 Euros and later 70 Euros stating that's maximum they can offer. Despite sharing all the bills, and continues follow-up, I haven't been able to get any success.

### "dissatisfied with my luggage"
Brussels to Seoul via Rome. Staff on board was friendly, basic entertainment. My experience was quite satisfactory. I was very dissatisfied with my luggage. It had severe damage and inside many of my goods were damaged. They wouldn't compensate me for this issue. The customer agent says it needs to be reported after you claimed the damage at the airport itself. I think this will be my last flight with Alitalia.

### "flight was the worst"
Delhi to Barcelona via Rome. Not only my experience with them before the flight was horrible. The flight was the worst I've ever traveled.

### "attitude of  crew was terrible"
I have travelled with Alitalia for more than 20 years, and though out this time quality of service and employees’ attitude has been going up and down. In the last three trips however I experienced the worst possible service on both sides. Old plane flying the intercontinental route (low cost type of searing, front and back seats broken). Poor food quality as well as entertainment. The attitude of the crew was terrible. You can manage one person with a bad day, but when three or four through the journey are unnecessarily unpleasant. I really wish I had more options to fly out of Miami.

### "Really nice cabin crew"
Brussels to Rome. Really nice cabin crew, clean plane. Flight comfortable and fast, we landed in Rome even 30 minutes before, they allowed me to arrive on time on Christmas Eve. I will fly again with Alitalia

### "cabin crew were very friendly"
London (LHR) to Milan (LIN). Boarding was quick and efficient, flight departed on time and cabin crew were very friendly. The aircraft was clean, seats were comfortable and the price was excellent. I strongly recommend Alitalia.

### "nothing served to me for first 6 hrs"
Delhi to Rome. Horrible flight. Unprofessional and unkind flight crew, nothing was served to me for first 6 hrs of flight, not even water or beverages. Crew was unpleasant when I asked for water and then for coffee later.

### "I found them to be fine"
Not Verified |  Flew Rome to Barcelona and I found them to be fine. They were on time, the flight attendants were courteous and efficient, and they got my luggage on board the flight properly. Thus, I would not hesitate to fly them again nor recommend them.

### "most horrible experience"
Boston to Rome. Horrible service and terrible food. I flew from Boston to Rome in Economy Class, there was a steward extremely rude and unfriendly. You can't even ask a glass of wine or coffee. Lame service, extremely slow. They also lost my bag that I've got 3 days later with the broken lock. At the Rome airport the staff was so unprofessional. It took them 50 minutes to check in my bag, unbelievable. The most horrible experience ever.

### "unkind and far from nice"
Rome to São Paulo. My seat was 22L. The flight attendants in that part of the airplane were unkind and far from nice. After dinner we were served coffee and tea, and none of the flight attendants passed by that area to collect used cups and napkins. We had to put the dirty cups inside the pouches of the seats in front of us because the flight attendants working in that section had to go to their rest period. They believed they were doing the passengers a huge favor in serving us dinner and, before landing, breakfast. Unfortunately, that's typical of Alitalia economy class in-flight service.

### "good experience with Alitalia"
I flew with Alitalia from Milan Linate to New York via Rome Fiumicino; the experience was not bad. The flight from Linate to Rome was a normal national flight (nothing to say) and landed on time. The flight to NY was on time too, the crew was friendly, the food ok and the airbus clean. The flight back to Rome landed 1 hour early and, as usual, food, crew and aircraft ok! To cut a long story short, good experience with Alitalia.

### "a pretty miserable experience"
Not Verified |  At Milan Linate they always put you on a bus to the aircraft which therefore defeats any priority boarding advantage since everybody is lumped together. Once the doors of the bus open it is survival of the fittest with a stampede of people to the stairs of the aircraft to see who can get on-board first. Once onboard, the stewardess insisted I put my carry-on on a different overhead locker since the one directly above my seat was partly in business class which was only had 2/3 of the seats occupied (middle seat deliberately not used) - never encountered such an issue before in 20 plus years of flying. Other people also having to deal with the "difficult" stewardess resulting in further delays to a flight that already had been delayed by 30 mins. This resulted in the captain actually coming out to speak to the Alitalia staff to tell them to hurry up with completing the boarding. Once seated, very little legroom. Free" small selection of drinks and snacks - no opportunity to buy any food or drinks. Overall a pretty miserable experience.

### "very unpleasant experience"
São Paulo to Rome. Horrible experience regarding service. The airplane may not be new, but considering it's Economy Class, the seats are spacious if compared to newer airplanes. But what was really terrifying about this flight was the horrible, appalling service given by the flight attendants in the section of the airplane where I was seated (22L). Those staff simply hate their jobs and make it clear that they hate having to serve other people. Disgracefully, these 'other people' are the clients who paid for a seat on their airplanes, hoping to receive some decent service, which doesn't happen. These crew members are the most unkind, unattentive and rudest professionals of all crews in European airlines. Due to my job I have to fly Alitalia frequently and it's always a very unpleasant experience. If you can, avoid Alitalia whenever possible!

### "Really disappointing"
Not Verified |  New York to Rome. Really disappointing flying with Alitalia! I am Italian and even if I am leaving in Germany, together with my family we have decided to fly Alitalia to support our own airline. Wrong decision. The service was not good, for example the hostess came only once to offer some water (during dinner time) and nothing more afterwards. When you asked for something (e.g. additional drink), it was like asking for a huge favor, and I was in Premium Economy! The plane was not clean, I had a broken biscuit under my seat. The crew was not friendly, no smile, no “arrivederci” when we were leaving the plane. I am sure that my experience is not the exception as I was flying from Rome to Los Angeles and same things happened. Lowest service I have never had.

### "receipt is deliberately misleading"
Rome to London. Paid for extra luggage on the way out. When we arrived at the airport to return we were told that we had only paid for luggage one way. The email receipt is very misleading suggesting we had paid for the extra space there and back. This stopped us from paying in advance and cost us an extra 20 Euros. I can’t help but feel the information on the receipt is deliberately misleading so people end up having to pay more at the airport than they otherwise would have needed to. Avoid.

### "aircraft very clean"
Round trip Milano Linate - Bruxelles operated with Embraer 90 (small aircraft but very good legroom) and with Airbus 319 (comfortable with good legroom) bought for 110 Euro. Both flight were on time, the aircraft very clean and the crew friendly; a soft drink and snack has been offered. I especially enjoyed the peaceful during all flight. Nothing to compare with low cost company!

### "have to check our carry-ons"
Rome to Paris. While waiting at the gate, an employee of Alitalia placed a tag on my wife's carryon bag and said that we would have to check our carry-ons "because the flight was full. He did not question whether our carry-ons conform to size and weight regulations, which they did. My wife and I objected explaining that since we had to make a connecting flight, there would not be time to wait for our bags to be unloaded. The agent then was confrontational and stated "we have to check them in. He then made a misleading statements: "The baggage claim in Paris is very near the gate and you will not have to wait for your bags;" "Your connecting flight is just next door to Alitalia. You will have plenty of time. In fact our US flight was from Terminal 1 and we landed in Terminal 2, a good 15 minutes away. When on board we were immediately notified of a 50 minute delay of our departure. The result of this fiasco: Because we had to wait another 40 minutes to claim our luggage that the agent had checked against our stated wishes, we missed our flight.

### "Ok, but not great"
Flew Rome to Los Angeles. Ok, but not great. The quality of Alitalia is on par with that of United about 15 years ago. The seat cushions were coming apart, the in-flight entertainment was old and clunky (and in many cases just not accessible, as many titles gave me a "unavailable" response), they didn't have any cocktails on board, and there was no in-flight WiFi. Additionally, the headphones they gave us for in-flight entertainment didn't work, and the bathrooms on board were not very clean. The only real upside was the tiramisu they served as dessert.

### "they only offered one meal"
Delhi to Rome, which is not a short flight, it's almost an 8-hour flight, they only offered one meal that too only one hour or so before landing in Italy, which was not even warm and fresh. To top it, they never offered any earphones for the in-flight entertainment during the whole flight. In spite of calling them several times for water, no one from the staff cared to provide water to me.

### "Worst customer service"
I flew into Rome from Croatia 45 minutes before my flight to Naples at 3 pm. Alitalia would not issue me a boarding pass saying I was too late to make the flight that was still boarding. They would allow me to take the next flight at 9:30 pm but I would have to purchase a new ticket. The new ticket cost was $100 higher than the cost of the initial ticket and $50 more than my sister's ticket who was at the next agent getting her ticket. I asked why my ticket cost was higher, I was told that it was because it was a different level but couldn't explain why. The reason they said was because it costs more! I was very annoyed and said I would never fly with them and the agent mocked me openly and blatantly. No one tried to help us even though denying us our 3 pm flight had a serious impact on our connections from there and inconvenienced many others. Worst customer service ever. It isn't surprising that they may be facing bankruptcy.

### "checked in my hand luggage"
Rome to London. They checked in my hand luggage twice in a row for no reason. It was not overweight (it was empty) and the plane was not full as I was the first boarding and then all the people after boarded with hand luggage. One travels with just a hand luggage so one doesn't have to wait for the bags after. Then whats the point. People after were let in with two pieces bag.

### "Impressive positive changes"
Not Verified |  Impressive positive changes from Alitalia. So much that it has become a pleasure flying with them. On time flights, friendly staff, acceptable airline food and drink. Really nice and improved lounge called Casa Italia in Rome airport. Also large part of Rome Airport is modern, new and nice. Lets just stop having to drive by bus from apron to terminal. Enjoyed my flight with Alitalia .

### "Free snack and light beverages"
Milan to Athens return. Flight on time, clean aircraft but very cramped seat. Free snack and light beverages. No communication from cockpit. Return flight perfectly on time, very good legroom and same service of the previous flight. Very attentive safety procedures. All in all well done Alitalia.

### "I've never had a problem"
Very positive review: the flight was in perfect time, the aircraft clean and comfortable. During the flight from Rome to Amman (night flight) was served two snacks (panino+muffin) and soft drinks. Alitalia provides pillows and blanket. I flew with Alitalia many times and I've never had a problem, can't understand why so many negative feedback.

### " Excellent flights both ways"
Chicago to Athens via Rome. Excellent flights both ways from Chicago to Athens. Our connection was held in Rome so we made it on time. Staff was very nice, food was excellent, and seats were comfortable. My family and I are going to Greece again hopefully, and we would fly Alitalia for sure.

### "don't get what you pay for from them"
Not Verified |  Flight from Rome to FK, June 2018. Payed over $4,000 for two premium economy tickets on Alitalia. One seat was broken/didn't recline at all. An almost 10 hour flight! TV did not work, and food tray was broken as well. Flight attendant took down my info, promising me a call from Alitalia. That call never came! This airline claims they do not have a phone number to call about issues. Must email or write them! I continously did so, and received nothing for weeks! Finally got an email stating a $100 voucher would be given to me to use within a year! I spent over $4,000 for 2 premium seats! I tried to fight this through emails and letters mailed to their New York PO box, and got nowhere! We will never fly Alitalia again for business or personal travels, nor will our large family. They are a rip off for charging as much as they did, and not refunding at least some of our money to us due to us not receiving practically anything of what everyone else paid for and received. Empty seats were observed and never offered to us. I hope this helps others from being ripped off as I was. This airline is good at taking your money, yet not doing right by their customers when you don't get what you pay for from them. This was an almost 10 hour flight with no TV, no seat that reclined, and not even a food tray that came down correctly (not even to lay your head on). So much for paying thousands for extra comfort in premium seating! Please do yourselves a favor and choose another airline.

### "serve free food nowadays"
Madrid to Rome. Boarding was on time and quite fast. The plane was very old, it can't even illuminate properly the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Service on short European flight consist in a drink and a little snack, I think Alitalia is one of the few European airlines to serve free food nowadays. Our flight was delayed for 1 hour in Madrid due to airport congestion, so we arrived late in Rome.

### "our luggage was lost"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Rome. My husband and I landed in Rome for our honeymoon three days ago and were informed our luggage was lost. We filled out the proper paperwork and left with our driver for our hotel. By the end of the night we were informed the luggage had been located at the airport and would arrive at our hotel by the following morning. Morning came and went with no luggage. We called the airline and the process of calling, being told to wait, and calling again began. For 72 hours this continued until our last day in Rome, today. We have spent hundreds in euro on clothes and hours trying to locate what we needed to enjoy our stay. Our options now are to take a taxi to and from the airport (40 minute drive) without receiving any reimbursement, or continue to wait for our luggage to magically reappear before we must leave for our final destination. We cannot afford the taxi since we have already spent so much on things we packed and have no access too, so we are left to wait. With no service on either of our american phones, the only option we have to get updates is to stay at the hotel where we can receive calls. Alitalia and their treatment of our case has ruined our stay in Rome. We only pray that our 3 days in Vienna might treat us with slightly more decency so that we may enjoy the honeymoon we have both worked so hard to experience.

### "been a nice surprise"
Seoul to Milan via Rome. The flight has been a nice surprise: Korean and Italian staff was very nice and kind, food is the best I had on airplane. The wine that comes from a real glass bottle, leg space is better then standard.

### "experience was awful"
Rome to Paris. We go to the ticketing area & they have someone standing at the entrances to confirm you are in the right area, so the man checked our paper & said go right here. We stand in a long line, only to be told that we were in the wrong line!! The lady told us to go 2 rows down. (be aware that even though it says Alitalia in really huge writing on the walls behind the desks, that there are different flight names displayed on the TV's above them in small writing up in the corner of the TV). I told the lady that the guy standing right there directed me here, and that it says Alitalia right there, then she pointed out that its what's on the TV. So we go in this long line & wait. We get to the counter, & the guy starts talking to another man (which seemed to be a supervisor). We thought that maybe he was being trained so they were talking him through it, but they kept talking and laughing. We waited for awhile before I asked if there was an issue w/ our tickets. Then, he calmly says, I can't find your tickets, you'll have to go to the help desk over there. I told him we didn't have a lot of time because we had already been directed to the wrong line & that our info was right there. He said I can't help you. So we go over there & there is about 8 people in front of us & only 1 person working at that desk. I'm starting to panic at this point because I didn't want to miss our flight, we had even came really early! I tell my bf to wait inline while I go back & see if someone else could help us because it seemed like this guy didn't know what he was doing at all. I ask a man standing up front to help because we are running out of time, he directs me to the same guy that we just dealt with - I tell him we are going to miss our flight, he says you have plenty of time. I couldn't believe how he was treating me. I was so frustrated, I had to walk away. I went back to my bf & told him, he went to the kiosk to see if he could print them while I waited inline. I get up to the lady tell her he couldn't find them, she calls over to him, writes something on the paper & says go back over there & they will take you right away. (Her attitude was not any better she was  rude as well!!) So I turn & rush to get my bf from the kiosk & she starts yelling at me to go back to that desk & I told her that I have to get my bf, then she says ma'am you don't have time!!! (I know we don't have time!!) So we go back to the man to get our tickets & we cut the line like she said to. He refused to help us right away, so my bf says are you guaranteeing that we will not miss our flight? He says yes & then I think he worried so he stopped helping the other people & got us our tickets. We had to run to get to our gate. we barely made it. Then the boarding lady was taking bags because there was no room & gets into it with this elderly couple because they refused to give her their bags, because they lost their bags last time. She was not understanding at all, they ended up not letting them board, instead of letting them keep their bags. The whole experience was awful, customer service was very poor!

### "poor quality service"
Palermo to Moscow via Rome and I was so unlucky that I left my laptop on board of the aircraft on our way to Moscow. When I realized that the laptop was left, I called to the support service in Russia and asked what should I do. I was told to send a request to the Alitalia lost and found office. The only e-mail address on the website was Italian , and after sending the request I was answered, that this Office has only responsibility for the things left on board of the airplanes going to Rome and was advised to contact Sheremetyevo airport. Sheremetyevo airport explained that they do not collect things from other Airlines, except Aeroflot. Things that are left on board of Alitalia Airlines are brought to the small Alitalia Office located at Sheremetyevo. After asking Alitalia main Office for the contact, I got the answer that they dont have it. So the only way to find something you left on board going to Moscow is to come every day to Sheremetyevo Alitalia Office and ask them personally. No e mail address, No telephone number, No permanent working hours. Basically you have to live in Sheremetyevo and wait if the lady in a green Alitalia T shirt will get returned your laptop. How come that the national airline company of Italy do not have the local number of their own representative in Russia and cannot answer the simple question who gets the forgotten on board luggage if it is found? I can surely say that it a clear sign of unrespectful attitude to the customers and was really choked of the unwilling of the Alitalia employees to help, they were just redirecting every time from call centre in Russia back to lost and found Office in Rome. Really poor quality service!

### "not included in the upgrade"
Los Angeles to Rome. On the return flight from Los Angeles we traveled in Premium Economy having requested and obtained a flight upgrade. Having had the upgrade we thought we would enjoy all the privileges of this class of flight including the possibility of embarking 2 bags of 23 kg, but at the airport of LAX we learned that this was not included in the upgrade. Now, if the company offers me an upgrade (through participation in an auction) it should also specify which services the customer has access to and which are not. Needless to say, at the airport to our grievances they shrugged and the conclusion was that we were able to take two extra bags as members of the Ulisse Club. Frankly it was so many years that I did not travel Alitalia and in this circumstance I remembered why. Another flaw that I found is the bad grace of the stewardess and the bad conditions in which the toilets are left, which after so many hours and so many people who frequent them become unrealistic. Finally my seat, but it was bad luck, did not remain reclined but moved continuously upright. IT: Sul volo di ritorno da Los Angeles abbiamo viaggiato in Premium Economy avendo chiesto ed ottenuto un upgrade della classe di volo. Avendo avuto l'upgrade noi pensavamo di godere di tutti i privilegi di questa classe di volo tra cui la possibilità di imbarcare 2 bagagli da 23 Kg, invece all'aeroporto di LA abbiamo appreso che questo non era compreso nell'upgrade. Ora, se la compagnia mi offre un upgrade ( attraverso la partecipazione ad un'asta) dovrebbe anche specificare quali sono i servizi a cui il cliente ha accesso e quali no. Inutile dire che in aeroporto alle nostre rimostranze hanno fatto spallucce e la conclusione è stata che siamo riuscite ad imbarcare due bagagli in più in quanto membri del Club Ulisse. Francamente erano tanti anni che non viaggiavo Alitalia ed in questa circostanza mi sono ricordata del perchè. Un'altra pecca che ho riscontrato è la malagrazia delle hostess e le cattive condizioni in cui vengono lasciate le toilette, che dopo tante ore e tanta gente che le frequenta diventano improponibili. Da ultimo il mio sedile, ma sarà stata la sfortuna, non rimaneva reclinato ma si spostava continuamente nella posizione eretta.

### "do not recommend Alitalia"
Bucharest to Chicago via Rome. I do not recommend Alitalia and will never fly with this airline again. First, our luggage didn’t make our connecting flight on our departing trip and we had to wait over 24 hours to get our baggage. We had to go buy clothes meanwhile, which was very inconvenient. Then, the return trip was a disaster. We flew from Bucarest to Rome, where we had a 2 hour layover. We were at the gate early and got in line with everyone else, when my husbands ticket was scanned it was refused by there system. They told us to go stand in another line and wait for the one guy helping with all the issues. After 10 minutes he said we were fine and to go back in the boarding line. They scanned his ticket again and it refused it. They said to go back to the other guy again. We proceeded to have to stand there for 20 minutes while everyone else was boarded and our plane was scheduled to leave and they couldn’t figure out why the error was occurring. Have in mind we have a 1 year old child with us and she was getting very antsy. Finally they told us just to board because we were last. Our seats were not what we requested. We were told we had bulk head seats to accommodate our little girl but our seats were all the way in the back with NO leg room. We asked to be moved if possible and the stewarts refused to even try to help us. They said we need to sit and nothing is guaranteed. Next, when the plane went to take off it was coming off the ground and then slammed to a halt scaring the heck out of everyone. There was an instrumental problem with the plane and we had to end up sitting for 1.5 hours while it was fixed. Making it a crazy long 12 hour flight. The food is worse than other airlines and they expect you to get up and get your own beverages and crackers throughout the flight while they sit and sleep in their curtained area once they are done serving the dinner. I can’t believe they are paid to sleep instead of help paying customers. Go around with drinks. Pick up trash throughout the flight. Anything. We were so disappointed with our experience with Alitalia. For a couple more hundred bucks, it is well worth flying with another airline. Especially if flying with children. Other airlines go out of their way to make everyone comfortable and content, especially on such a long flight. Alitalia employees could care less and many of their employees are super rude. If you choose to fly with them, I have tried warning you.

### "can’t even charge your phone"
Some staff are rude and not kind to their customers and nice. Airplane is really old, you can’t even charge your phone. In 8 hours you eat only once full meal and you get some disgusting sweet after. I am angry and disappointed at this company. Worst experience ever!.

### "we had to pay 45€ per bag"
Athens to Amsterdam via Milan. How this airline can continue to operate is a mystery. Firstly, we had to pay 45€ per bag for our luggage without being notified when we booked. There are no meals on board. Even the quality of the snacks they serve is very poor. The most uncomfortable experience of flying Alitalia is that the seats are so small and there is no legroom at all. It is actually impossible to seat throughout the journey. I will never ever fly with Alitalia and I feel I didn't get value for my money.

### "flight experience was also horrible"
I am not surprised that the company is failing: this is consistently, and without surprises, the worst airline I've flown with. First, I tried to upgrade. There were no seats left, but I still spent over 20 dollars to try and do so, because they're the only flagship airline I know that has a paid (and ridiculously expensive: 1 eur/min) customer service phone line. And it's obviously the only way you can upgrade, no option to do so from their website. The check-in was horrible, with a never ending line because it took them forever to check people in. In the end they had to ask help from the desks of another airline to cope with that. The flight experience was also horrible: the plane was old and filthy, the food was little and disgusting (I very rarely leave food on my plate, but some of that was inedible), the in-flight entertainment consisted of a screen just slightly bigger than my phone with a handful of movies that kept breaking for no apparent reason. The service on the plane was, guess what, horrible. Their stewards were borderline rude, throwing things on my tray when serving them, constantly hitting my head or shoulder because they didn't look where going. They were also arrogant and incompetent: when I asked for an immigration card, they told me I didn't need it anymore, and got annoyed as I insisted. In the end I didn't get one, and once I reached the immigration officer I had to go to the back of the queue because obviously I was right and they were wrong, and I did need an immigration card with my visa. I vowed in the past I wouldn't travel with Alitalia anymore. This time I couldn't avoid it, but they confirmed, once again if there was any need, that I made the right choice back then. I do hope they finally go out of business, as they absolutely deserve that.

### "This is the worst airline"
We flew from Johannesburg to Athens with a stop over in Rome and back again for the first time with Alitalia in July 2018. This is the worst airline I have traveled with. Going to Europe, we waited 2 hours after take-off for food to be served. The evening meal was meager, the drinks were served after the meal with NO chance of getting a second glass of wine. I felt as though I was in prison! 10 minutes after dinner the lights were switched off and like good children we were put to sleep. No sight of air stewards/stewardesses anywhere - they must have a special hole that they disappear into at night. In the morning a croissant was provided with no chance of a second cup of coffee. The staff were unfriendly in the extreme and I felt that this was the last place they wanted to be. On our return, I noticed that my seat could not recline (this is an overnight flight) and asked one of the staff for help. When he saw that the seat was faulty, he waved me to the back of the plane and told me to sit in the one empty seat next to someone else. He did not escort me there and explain to this stranger why I was going to sit next to them or of my predicament, which I would have thought would be the right way to do this. In the end, I "slept" upright. The same type of sub-standard meal was presented as dinner - again no chance to ask for another glass of wine to put myself out of my misery as the air staff bolted away and switched off the lights as soon as they could. One burnt croissant for breakfast later we were back in South Africa and I have never been happier to step off a plane. Awful, awful, awful service.

### "All in all, Alitalia delivered"
This was my fifth flight on Alitalia in the past 12 months and I have been fifth time lucky in experiencing on time departure and arrival! Ground crew at Malpensa's Terminal 2 were helpful - I had an easy check in at a counter. Immigration and security checks were smooth and quick despite the large number of flyers. At the gate, the boarding appeared to have been started too close to the departure time as a result of which everyone was standing and crowding the entrance. The seating was in a 2-4-2 configuration and I had an aisle seat. The leg space was sufficient and the seat reclined more than I had expected. There was personal IFE with a large collection of Italian movies and also films in languages other than English. I particularly appreciated the live BBC and NBC news that was available. The IFE was turned on after 30 minutes into the flight and free head phones were provided. Being an afternoon flight, a lunch was offered. There were only two choices - no menu cards. One was a vegetarian lasagna, the other a turkey sandwich. I chose the former. The overall portion of the meal was on the smaller side. Alcoholic drinks were complimentary. After the lunch, I asked the flight attendant if limoncello, the Italian after meal drink was available. She smiled and brought me some from, I assume, business class. Flight attendants spoke English and were very approachable. Before landing, a snack was served. Drink carts ran up and down the aisles quite regularly. The bathrooms stayed relatively clean. Customs cards were distributed prior to landing. You don't need these any more if you are using the passport machines to process your entry into the U.S. There was a duty free catalog in the pocket behind the seat in front of you. But there were few, if any, items in it that you could not get in any major city. I would have liked a cold towel on boarding, given the heat and sweat that accompanied the trip to Malpensa and a similar towel just before arriving could be refreshing. All in all, Alitalia delivered.

### "was a very bad service"
Rome to Tirana. The worst airline I have traveled with. Traveled with Alitalia twice and both times I had major problems. To begin, we were a large family traveling to Albania with a connection in Rome. On our way back to Toronto, my grand-parents needed assistance and therefore had to remain seated in the plane until assistance came and took them to the connecting flight. Long story short, when we got to our connecting flight and asked if my grand-parents boarded, the Alitalia representatives had no idea where my grand-parents were. After a long argument they finally found them and brought them to the flight. When my Grandparents sat in their seats, my grandpa began to vomit and the flight attendants did not help or offer assistance at all, they just rolled their eyes. In general it was a very bad service, no warmth.

### "found service extremely poor"
Chicago to Tel Aviv via Rome. Overall, I found the service provided by Alitalia be extremely poor. First, my seat back was broken, that it would just recline, even without me pressing against it. Next, while I had requested a specific dietary meal a few days before boarding, the airline had no record of. Instead of trying to be accommodating and helpful, the steward's attitude was "we don't have it. There was no one offering drinks throughout the flight. While deplaning with my children (as we were last), I thanked the steward. His hostile reply was, "well, the cleaning crew is waiting for you. I was shocked, and in the scurry, I forgot my cell phone on the plane. There was no one at the gate to welcome us, and report the lost phone. I had to go to a central service desk, wait a half hour for service to file a report, which didn't get me anywhere. I tried calling customer service, I was told that there is no line to customer service, you can only file a claim via email. This turned out to be nothing but a headache and much aggravation. It is certainly not worth your time or money to fly with such an amateurish airline.

### "No timely announcement"
Rome to Athens. On initial boarding time (15:35) an announcement issued for delay of the flight until the airplane arrives. No timely announcement to passengers though late aircraft arrival was known. Delay, again. Usual Alitalia food (crisps, biscoti or saltie) compared to other airlines regular food supply. No entertainment unless if you consider entertainment the airline shopping guide.

### "getting its act together"
Alitalia had some great deals lately so booked 2 round trips in Business class. AMS-FCO-ATH AND AMS-FCO-FLR. All flights more or less on time. Lounges in Amsterdam and Athens good. Lounge in Rome new lounge in E concourse prefect the old Schengen lounge at D1 a dump. Check in staff generally outsourced but perfect. Alitalia staff is a mixed bag. Some staff really doing their best some really need a training or unmotivated. Onboard in general spacious for euro business, middle seat free and extra legroom. On all flights (except domestic) there was a hot pasta meal served which was surprisingly good, along with hot bread a sweet dessert but a lousy salad. A selection of wines , incl sparkling and limoncello and chocolates where also offered inmost cases. All in all especially considered the low price a great steal. Also Alitalia offers lots of miles compared to other Skyteam partners. Alitalia is getting its act together hopefully its saved by the bell. Will book again

### "Last time for me flying Alitalia"
Los Angeles to Rome. Flight was delayed 40 min. without explanation. As usual with Alitalia there was no order in calling rows to board the plane and a huge crowd of passengers were standing there waiting for the rows to be called. Very confusing without structure. My seat was completely abused and it was the worst seat I’ve had on over 200 flights in my life. Crew looked great but poor service. Arrogant and unlike other airlines they were sitting talking among themselves in the back of the plane. Last time for me flying Alitalia! That’s for sure!

### "price was very reasonable"
Not Verified |  Heathrow to Rome (rtn) in economy class onboard an older A321 outbound and an A320 on the inbound flight. Check-in on both flights was prompt and professional and seats which had been pre-booked were offered. The boarding was organised and although both flights were full this was straight forward and stress free. The seats are tight in economy but no more than other airlines. The price was very reasonable at £146 return and again was the main factor for choosing AZ. The flight offered a drinks service which was all complimentary but no food. Once again this is comparable to BA so no major grumble here. Overall I would recommend AZ on the short-haul product. The staff are friendly enough and I don't see any major difference from any other airline within Europe.

### "charged 55 Euros per bag"
I did not note that if I did not pay for my bags ahead of time I would be charged 55 Euros per bag. Then I got on the flight and I have never been crammed into a seat so small. I am 5’8 and I couldn’t even sit in the seat without my legs being squashed into the seat in front of me.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
Have heard a lot of negative reviews about Alitalia but was pleasantly surprised. Onward journey, Delhi-Rome staff not so friendly but otherwise efficient, food ok and leg space ok. Rome-Delhi staff friendly, food only Italian but tasty, leg space ok and flight on time. A no frills airline. Will definitely recommend.

### "definitely fly them again"
London to Johannesburg via Rome. Booked Alitalia due to the price and had no expectations at all. The flight from LHR was delayed by an hour due to really bad weather and was uneventful. The cabin crew were not happy on this leg but were still cordial. Arriving in Rome I boarded the JNB flight straight away. The crew meeting passengers at the door were great, especially the male flight attendant. I was happily surprised with the seats too. I had been led to believe that it would be cramped but this was not the case. The seats were wide and the pitch was really great compared to many other airlines. The service was swift and on the whole friendly. The food was standard and on par with other airlines and drinks and snacks were left out in the galleys along with a variety of drinks. I honestly have no problem in recommending Alitalia and will most definitely fly them again.

### "not informed of baggage policies"
Naples to Rome. We booked our tickets through Kayak and were not informed of the baggage policies beyond the usual thing. When we traveled from Palermo to Naples, we were allowed to check one bag and carry on a bag with no additional fees. However, the problem began on our flight from Naples to Rome. When we went to check our bags, we were informed our checked bags were each over 8 kg. They charged us 53 Euros per bag to check them. The ticket agent gave us a lot of misleading information about what our options were. According to their company policies, we were charged the wrong excess baggage fee but they won't even refund that and charge us the right fee. Take the train for much less money, no baggage restrictions, etc.

### "never again and never Alitalia"
Rome to Boston. I would like to thank the Alitalia desk agent at the Rome airport who taught me a very important lesson! I will never be a complacent traveler again. We arrived 6 hours early to check in for our flight home. We had bought and paid for our seats 5 months ago and were to be seated in Row 19 A and C. For some reason we were reassigned to seats 44 A and C right next to the toilet. We did not notice the change until we had left the area. Fortunately, there were numerous empty seats in the middle of the aircraft and we did move. Now the fault lies with us for not returning to the agent for an explanation and to demand our original seats. The agent must have really enjoyed her day knowing that she had placed two people in the worst possible seats for a nine hour flight. I always try to be patient and understanding when changes are made. Never again and never Alitalia.

### "Horrible customer service"
New York JFK to Rome. Horrible customer service: rude, horrible flight. Cramped more than other flights, air conditioning did not work so it was extremely hot. Extremely disorganized.

### "cold and unfriendly"
Flew Alitalia from Palermo to Geneva via Rome. Worst customer experience on an airline yet. All flights were on time and baggage arrived correctly, so it is not about operations. From the first telephone contact, initially to change a flight, to the personnel at check in and inflight service, the welcome to guests is cold and unfriendly. Both ways (to and from Palermo) was obliged to check my carry on bag, despite it being of regulation size, as the flight was supposedly full and overhead bin space needed for other carry on. (Why theirs, not mine? Because I also had a checked bag?). In both cases, I observed plenty of available space in overhead lockers when flights took off. Additionally, boarding badly indicated and several passengers from Rome missed the first bus to the plane. Of four flights, 3 all had buses to distant locations despite this being a national airline. Final detail: no food offered to passengers other than a salty cracker snack, whether first thing at 7 am or at 9 pm. Soft drinks only. Would rather fly a low cost and pay for my drinks.

### "a waste of money and time"
I had a terrible experience travelling with Alitalia. I booked a ticket with KLM from New York JFK to Athens via Rome, but the return flight was unfortunately operated by Alitalia. First of all, we were waiting for 5 hours inside a landed airplane because the crew were waiting for the second pilot. I can't even tell how rude they were with passengers, they only gave us one glass of water and a small snack, even though we'd been waiting 5 hours! Furthermore, I had a flight connection, which I lost because of the long delay of the first flight so I had to wait for 4 more hours at Rome Fiumicino. The ground staff were rude and barely spoke English. Alitalia was a waste of money and time!

### "everything was perfect"
Prague to Cairo via Rome and Alitalia was really nice. I was impressed by the quality of service. The only problem was that they don't have any in-flight entertaining , other than that everything was perfect.

### "Really improved experience"
Rome to Buenos Aires. Alitalia's premium class service improved significantly in the last years. Alitalia Lounge (Casa Alitalia) in Rome Fumicino is far from what you expect for a Business Class Lounge, they still have to work on it. On the plane, the renovated Magnifica Class seats on the Boeing 777-200 are really comfortable and recline 180 degrees. Seat massage is standard and IFE has to be improved (few movies for a 14hr flight and most of them could only be seen in italian). Professional and attentive crew. They walk through the cabin during the flight asking passengers if everything is OK. Food service is awesome, four course dinner. Amenity kit from Bulgari is fine, the only thing missing, an Alitalia pen. Really improved experience.

### "This is the worst airline"
Missed my connection to Cairo because my United Airlines flight was late getting into London. To get me to Cairo faster. They switched my flight to Alitalia and this is where my nightmare began. I flew from Heathrow and transferred in Rome to Cairo Egypt. Before I boarded my flight I went to the desk to make sure my suitcase had been transferred to the flight. The gate attendant looked on the computer and said yes your bag is on board. I then boarded the flight transferred in London and made it too my final destination Cairo. The flight from Rome to Cairo was very rocky and I couldn't wait too get off that plane. I then proceeded to baggage claim to pick up my suitcase. Every bag came out and mine was no where to be found. I started to panic because I was meeting friends in Cairo and we were on a 14 day trip to Egypt, Israel and Jordon. I went to look for baggage office and there was know one there except a lady giving out paper missing luggage reports. No computers nothing. I pleaded with her that this was an emergency and I needed to get my suitcase back immediately because I was on a 14 day international trip. She assured me my bag would be on the next flight and they would immediately send my bag to my hotel in Cairo. I felt relieved went to my hotel two days passed no bags no nothing. I tried calling the number on missing luggage report that she gave me know one answered. Tour guides,manager of hotel everyone tried calling to get my luggage back. Finally I realized they gave me a number that wasn't being answered at all. I had another flight and went back to Cairo to file a police report. I reported my luggage stolen because the airline gave me false contact info. I had to borrow clothes from my friends I was traveling with. Buy clothes from street markets when I could. I was stressed out but still hoping they would return my luggage well long story short. Alitalia airlines kept my luggage the whole 14 days I was traveling. My bag was finally returned to me when I got back to USA. It was twenty five days later. I had put a card on my luggage with my contact info it had my name home phone number, address and email address. They never contacted me at all instead they let my luggage sit in a luggage room the whole time with my info on it. What did I get from this airline. They said we're sorry you were inconvinced. To date I have received nothing no compensation for severely disrupting my dream vacation. This is the worst airline on the planet. I wouldn't trust them with anything. Don't give them your bags. They lose bags and don't care.

### "very efficient indeed"
I flew from Milan Linate to Palermo with Alitalia. This was my second Alitalia flight of the day. I found the boarding very efficient. The cabin crew were mostly older men and not friendly. I observed how Italian passengers were treated in a more friendly and amicable manner than non-Italians. The interior of the aircraft was very clean and the cup of coffee was much appreciated. The flight arrived on-time and my bag was quickly delivered.

### "the flight was smooth"
Wasn’t bad at all! I was really preparing for the worst after reading some terrible reviews but the flight was smooth and seats not too uncomfortable. I’m an incredibly nervous flyer and was crying during boarding and take off but the staff were very kind and helpful. The food was bad though, and entertainment system subpar and outdated and the flight from Rome to London had nothing at all. However it was a very smooth flight and my baggage arrived safely too. Satisfied! I hope the return trip with Alitalia goes as well.

### "unacceptable service from Alitalia"
Business Class from London to New Delhi via Rome and this was the worst C class product I have seen. Check-in at LHR took 25 minutes as economy class passengers were served at the C class check-in. During the first flight there was no pre-departure drink offered. The meal served after take off was the smallest I've seen and inedible. I did not see an FA for the remaining of the flight. I had to push the call button to get some water that came in a plastic cup. Plane landed with some blinds closed and items on the floor on first row as there was no pre-landing cabin check. The flight to Delhi was worse. We were served a small meal soon after take off and for about 4.5 hours I did not see an FA in the cabin. I wanted a snack and a drink mid flight and pushed the call button 4 times within 2 hours - no one turned up. About an hour before landing we were served another small meal. Most of the options on their menu apparently did not exist, so I ended up having some bread and fruits. This is unacceptable service from Alitalia.

### "skip Alitalia at all costs"
Tehran to Toronto via Rome. I thought North American airlines were the worst but both flights on Alitalia were terrible. Particularly the flight from Tehran, the aircraft was extremely old, staff terrible and they skipped us for drinks. The food was a terrible cheese sandwich and seats super tight with no screens. The aircraft to Toronto was better and the staff nicer. Food was terrible and it's the first time I've seen an airline save on butter and water. Unless you want to see Rome and no other airline can take you, skip Alitalia at all costs.

### "only two rounds with drinks"
Miami to Rome. This is the worst airline I have travelled with. The only positive I can mention is the ground service in Miami, after this everything was only getting worse. Cabin crew was unfriendly and unhelpful, there was only two rounds with drinks during entire almost 10 hour flight, no snacks between dinner and breakfast. During the dinner service cabin crew forgot about me and I had to go after service to ask for a dinner for myself. The food was so terrible that after the dinner I thought that skipping me during the dinner service wasn't the worst thing that happened. Toilets were very dirty.

### "not worth this nightmare"
My boyfriend and I flew Alitalia Miami to Rome and our luggage did not make it to Rome with us. We filed a claim at FCO and were assured our luggage would be delivered to us where we were staying in Venice. We spent our entire time in Venice either trying to contact them or being available for them to contact us to let us know when to expect our luggage. Every person we talked to gave us different information ("the bags should be delivered tonight," 2 hours later "one bag is in Rome but we don't know about the other," 2 hours later "both bags are still in Miami," etc. ), but all assured us that our bags would be delivered to us. It wasn't until the night before we were supposed to leave Venice that we were informed that we would have to go pick up our luggage ourselves from the Venice airport. Because the lost and found office at the Venice airport doesn't open until 10AM, this meant missing our 9:30AM train to Florence which we'd already bought tickets for, and having to spend 30 euros on roundtrip tickets to the Venice airport plus buying 100 euro replacement train tickets to Florence. Since we've been back home, Alitalia has been just as useless. I was told the office that handles delayed baggage claims has no phone number, and it takes roughly 3 days to get a canned email response from them. Alitalia is refusing to reimburse us for the bus tickets to the Venice airport and the replacement train tickets to Florence we had to buy, because according to them we could have elected to not pick up our bags and just have them shipped to us back home in the states, clearly not a real option. My boyfriend is a graduate student and I work for a nonprofit; we got an amazing deal on these flights to Italy and saved up for 5 months for this trip. Any money we may have saved was negated by Alitalia's negligence. I have never experienced worse customer service in my life, and would advise anyone to avoid flying with Alitalia at all costs. While the flight experience itself was actually one of the better transatlantic flights I've taken, it was obviously not worth this nightmare. We had a tight connection coming from Atlanta to Miami via Delta so I understand the delayed luggage, but the way they handled the situation is absolutely unacceptable.

### "the cancellation policy"
New York to Albania via Rome. I reserved my flight a month ago and asked about the cancellation policy. I was charged extra so if I needed to I could cancel. 2 days before the flight I has a family pass away and could not make the flight. I called the company and I was encountered by the most heartless woman. She refused to help and hung up on me when I asked for the call to be escalated. I wish I would of never booked with them.

### "had to give up flying with Alitalia"
Flew Paris CDG to Sao Paulo via Rome. I have finally had to give up flying with Alitalia. I love the food on the flights (premium and business), I love their lounge in Rome FCO but unfortunately the organisation of this airline is an absolute disaster and it is no longer viable for me to fly with Alitalia. If you travel with only hand luggage and require no assistance Alitalia is still a great airline, if you need any assistance from ground crew or management forget it. I am sad to say my next flight (already booked and paid for) the week after next will be my last with Alitalia.

### "haul it was almost perfect"
Santiago de Chile to Berlin via Rome. Because the economy fares around Christmas and New Year were pretty expensive, I got an business class ticket for Alitalia, going from TXL to EZE and back from SCL, which was almost half of the price a normal trip like this would cos in business. I was a little afraid Alitalia will go bankrupt before my flights but I did risk it and the service I got was worth the money. The business class inside Europe is not a big deal, the legroom a little more and a meal served which was good. On the long haul side, it was almost perfect and I think this is how flying was used to be back in the 90s or 2000s. A lot of legroom, the seat turns into a bed, a huge screen with pretty good entertainment program, a lot of attention from the crew. The only downside I had was that the food portions (although incredibly delicious) were very small and don't fill you up. All flights landed around 30 Minutes before of schedule and I must say it was the first time I hadn't feel a 14 hours flight passing that quickly. The lounges in Rome were very well equipped, the ones in TXL and SCL were average.

### "Shocking customer service"
My husband and I flew from Geneva to Palermo via a brief stop in Rome. When we got to Rome our bags were not transferred onto our connecting flight and arrived in Palermo on another flight a few hours later. We received a text notifying us that our bags had arrived in Palermo, but our bags were not delivered to us until 2 days later, causing us to incur a lot of expenses in purchasing emergency items for the 2 days we were without baggage. After agreeing (over 5 months later) to compensate us for some of the hassle we went through, another 3 months later and they still haven't paid us. Emails are not responded to. Phone calls go nowhere. All we now get is silence. The airline has been fined by DOT for violating the International Baggage Liability Rule, but it still continues to violate the Montreal Convention. Shocking airline. Shocking customer service. No wonder it has started bankruptcy proceedings and has been put up for sale. If a buyer comes to bail it out, they are going to have one big mess to clean up!

### "horrible customer service"
Prague to Rome.They are absolutely horrible. They overbooked our flight from Prague to Rome by around 12 people. 12 people could not get on the flight! There was no information given and we waited in line to check in for an hour and a half before someone finally told us what was going on. We were then informed that the next available flight to Rome wouldn’t be for another 2 days. Who would like to reimburse us for the two days we may miss in our airbnb in Rome? ?Absolutely ridiculous and horrible customer service. How do you manage to overbook a flight for 12 people? ?

### "a very enjoyable flight"
I have flown on Alitalia many times on the same flight and as always, it was overall a very enjoyable flight flying from New York City to Milan. Besides having a free seat next to mine which added much more comfort, the aircraft was clean and cabin crew were very nice and welcoming. The meal was quite tasty and they don't serve as much food as Delta does on the same flight, but for the length of the flight it was enough.

### "give absolutely no reason to come back"
Flew Milan to Palermo. This was the worst airline experience I’ve had. My carry-on is exactly the measurements Alitalia approves of and I had just flown with it (with the exact same contents) on six other airlines around Europe. The woman at the counter said it was one kg above the limit and I asked to take my shoes out and put them in my backpack. She declined as she had “already printed my reciept to pay for a checked bag”. It was €45. €45 for a pair of shoes that easily fit in my backpack. The least helpful people to work in customer service. They give absolutely no reason to come back.

### 2do not choose this shoddy airline"
Alitalia is a joke airline. My flight was delayed by 6 hours due to a fault in one of the engines. In London the ground crew did eventually try to find passage on other carriers, however some of the passengers were told that the plane had been fixed just as we got to the ticket counter of Lufthansa, so we had to go back through security which was a bit of a pain. There was no inflight entertainment and the inflight meals were very poor. The staff on the flight also seemed a bit stressy. We had delays at Rome also. I tried to get a change of carrier for the return trip from my agent, but the cost of doing so would have been excessive. The return flight was similarly poor although there were no delays. However when I arrived at Heathrow I found that they had managed to break my suitcase lock. When I went to the service desk they gave me a form and a claim number. I was tod to submit the form by email to their customer relations department. I sent my claim form as requested, however I was told that I had to download another form, fill it in, sign it and send a scan of this form and of my passport. I did this, but in error sent the unfilled form back instead of the signed scan. Any reasonable customer care department would realise that this was an error. I was told that I am no longer eligible for the compensation for my bag even though I subsequently sent the correct file. All in all I would say if you want a reasonable flight do not choose this shoddy airline.

### "became clear flight was overbooked"
On 15th December 2017 my family and I were booked on a flight from London to Johannesburg - AZ207 to Rome, connecting to Abu Dhabi and Johannesburg with Etihad Airways. At Heathrow we were checked in up to Rome and told that our onward boarding passes would be given at Rome. On arrival in Rome we were told that our agent did not book our tickets for the flight from Rome to Abu Dhabi. We were told that it was our agent’s fault. We then decided to call the travel agent using roaming who confirmed that the tickets were all in order from his end. The agent advised us we need to insist on getting answers from Alitalia, to be informed what was going to happen rather than them blaming the agent for reason. This was through ticket issued all the way to Johannesburg, on Alitalia, code sharing with Etihad Airways. I then went to the desk to enquire about what was going to happen, was told to sit down and wait saying that they were busy getting the passengers to the flight. After I insisted that I wanted to know what was going to happen and that it was not fair to be told to sit without any explanation as it was clear that we were not boarding the flight, we were then informed that we will sleep in a hotel and be put on the next flight and that we don’t need to worry about our luggage as we will get it in Johannesburg. It became clear that the flight was overbooked or oversubscribed. I requested to speak with the manager and to our surprise she was there, was not saying anything or giving any explanation. We waited until it was impossible for us to travel at which point we were told to go to the Alitalia desk. Onward journey tickets were arranged for the 16 of December and an accommodation was arranged for Hilton hotel. We were told that onward ticket from Paris to Johannesburg will be on the 17 December. When my wife enquired we were told that it was the only flight available and that the next one will be towards the end of the week. We left the airport around 21:45. We were informed that the meal was included in the package but on arrival at the hotel the serving of meals had ended and were informed that the meal ends at 22:00. With no vouchers to purchase food from outside, we and the children had to go to bed hungry as the hotel was far from places where we could purchase food and no microwave food or bread in cafe. In addition there was no moisturiser we could as my family have allergic skin reaction. The following day we travelled to Paris which was the different from what was booked initially by the agent. On arrival in Paris we were made aware that our onward ticket was for the following day and that there was no hotel booked for the night. We explained at the desk that it was not our fault and that we cannot sleep on the street. The manager was called and fortunately tickets were arranged for travel later that evening which was Saturday. This proves that staff lied by saying there was no available flight for us on that day. We travelled to Johannesburg and on arrival our separately booked flight to Durban was missed due to the delay in Rome. We had to purchase another ticket. As we were promised that our luggage would be in our flight, this did not happen because we only received our luggage in total after seven days.

### "Very nice flight"
I fly often with Alitalia but this time I refer to the trip from Milan To Beijing via Rome. Seats very comfortable, very good meals, flight on time - no delay, cabin crew welcome. The price of the flight was fair. Very nice flight.

### "angry with the service"
Tunis to London via Rome. I am really angry with the service that my 6-month pregnant wife received from Alitalia. My connecting flight from Tunis on the 29th of January departed 20 minutes later the departure time giving very little time to sit on our next flight. We only had 50 minute wait time which now was reduced to 25 minutes to travel on a bus from one gate to another bus. When the first plane landed, a staff member rushed us to the next plane in Rome gate 14 although my wife was heavily pregnant. We were not allowed to go to the café directly outside gate 14 before boarding the plane so that she can get a small bite to eat before travelling as they refused to let us as the plane was “ready to depart”. They sat us down in the plane, although the plane still did not leave on time and was 25 minutes late. I requested then cabin crew to provide her with food, but they said only business class passengers will be served food and she will have to wait until we land in London. Did not expect such service from such a reputable company, I advise that no pregnant women should travel with Alitalia as she did not get an apology.

### "satisfied with all services"
Abu Dhabi to Rome. Tried this company again after many years and changed my opinion from slightly critical to positive. Appreciated ground service : requested seat and got full availability of lady who demonstrated the map of plane so I could choose where to sit. Aircraft was new and of  comfortable design. Appreciated the entertainment : wide choice of multilingual films and games for adults and children. Food very delicious, international breakfast. Appreciated kindness of on board staff and info from pilots, their effort to recuperate 1h delay.

### "threw the packets on my table"
I was travelling from London to Delhi via Rome and vice versa with Alitalia. The Staff were very rude. When I asked for some extra sugar and milk for my coffee, the air hostess literally threw the packets on my table. After having the dinner, I asked for some snacks and the staff said to me "are you still hungry after eating your dinner" which was so rude and unprofessional. When I asked for earphones, the staff said we have distributed all and don't have any. I am now on my way to London from Rome, same Airline.

### "offered only Italian food"
Rome to Delhi. 80% of the passengers on the flight were of India origin but the airline offered only Italian food. When I requested for non-vegetarian, I was told they had none. The drinks were only beer and wine, I requested for gin & tonic but was told they do not serve hard liquor. We had to wait 45 minutes in New Delhi for the baggage. I was flying AZ after a long time and had expected things would have improved after its takeover, but alas that is not so.

### "Never fly this airline"
Athens to Malaga via Rome. This airline is a total scam. We got a notification that we could bid on upgrades to business class a week before our flight. We decided business class sounded nice and so did it, but bid a low amount and the online tool indicated that we had a very unlikely chance of getting the seats. We ended up getting the seats. Note: our very low amount was actually double what we paid for our two tickets. When we got to the airport, even though we were business class, we still had to pay to check a bag through. We had been carrying the bag on but Alitalia made us pay to check it through. Then, when we boarded the plane, we found our seats were in the bulk head so had very little leg room, and the definition of business class on the flight was that the middle seat was left open. There was nothing that made the comfort any better than being in a regular economy seat. We were then not offered any beverage when we got on board, though they claim to provide that. We were given a mediocre meal and told that is a business class experience. Never fly this airline, they are cheap and lie about their services.

### "extra-space seat was sold twice"
Rome to Brussels. Starting from the baggage drop off: all done by the customer, without any assistance to explain a complex process, better arrive early and be armed with patience. At the gate, not enough seats for all passengers we had to wait for the bus standing in queue. On the plane we discovered our extra-space seat was sold twice. And the cherry, the seat had leg-space but was almost too narrow to sit.

### "have never liked Alitalia"
Milan Linate to Catania. I have never liked Alitalia even though i am Italian. There was no entertainment onboard, cabin crew only served water and soda. Seats were ok, aircraft ok as well. Not the worst airline in the world but not really nice.

### "not the worst but not good"
Milan to New York, aircraft was old (A330-200). Cabin crew was okay but I was calling cabin crew and they came like 40 mins after. Food was horrible, drinks were ok. IFE was so slow like to load a movie it took so much, and the variety wasn't that great either. Flight was Alitalia standards, not the worst but not good.

### "Terrible customer service"
Rome to New York. Terrible customer service! We arrived at the airport over 2 hours before our flight was supposed to take off. It took over an hour of to get checked in since they will not let you use a kiosk. After the guy printed our tickets and took our luggage he said it was now unlikely we would make our flight because we stood in line for so long and then we had a long walk ahead of us to the gate. They also would not change our seats for my husband and I to sit together on our on honeymoon. Somehow we made the flight to find our multiple other couples around us had been separated from their family as well. Service on the flight was not amazing either. I would pay more to avoid flying with this airline in the future.

### " customer service non-existent"
We have not yet even flown with Alitalia but experience so far has been very poor indeed. We had been warned about the airline but we had no choice in the matter. The forthcoming long flight due in January persuaded us to book comfort seats so we had extra leg room. Not cheap at £75 each on each flight. When I rang I was told I couldn't book these seats because I am over 65 (my wife is younger). When challenged they told me it was because the seats were by the emergency exits. After much discussion they said they would book them but could not guarantee that I would be able to board the plane. She said this is explained on their website. I checked and this is not so, it just says that passengers must be fit and able which I am. Emailed to complain about this but no reply. Tried again but no reply. Eventually I contacted the Customer Services Manager (not possible to email CEO unfortunately). She replied that their staff are really experienced and knew that age itself was not a barrier and I could book. She said she would remind their telephone staff. When I rang to try and book again I was once more was asked if I was over 65. When I said yes she went away to check if I could use these seats and eventually said she would book them. I was told I would get an email by reply - I didn't so phoned again and was told they would email me - they didn't. Emailed Customer Services Manager again to tell her of my recent experience. She emailed me back to say that their telephone staff would not have raised the issue of age and in fact it was me that raised it and because this had never been asked about before. This was absolutely not true. I went back to the CSM to tell her that she was being mislead and felt aggrieved that I was being blamed for the confusion. I said I felt that an apology would be in order. I have had no reply. Customer service seems non-existent, no wonder Alitalia is in trouble.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Rome to Brindisi. It had been many years since I had flown with Alitalia and my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by what was after all a domestic flight. The seats were comfortable, with an above average pitch. The crew were friendly and helpful. On a relatively short domestic flight they offered a beverage service. The only downside was having to take a bus to the aircraft. Overall, a better than expected flight.

### "nothing was smooth about the experience"
Flew Milan Linate to London Heathrow. As a frequent flier I tend to choose budget airlines because they are affordable and user friendly, with tiers of services that almost feel customized to everyone's needs. However, seeing as these days Alitalia's tickets can be affordable too, I thought I'd give it a try! Well, I'm saddened to say that nothing was smooth about the experience and I even ended up with additional unforeseen charges that made my journey way too expensive for how little enjoyable it's been. I massively regretted having chosen Alitalia and will not chose it again. And here's why: - Alitalia's website doesn't have a check-in button on the home page, you have to navigate the website and think creatively of where they might have placed the online check-in. When you find it, you understand that you will not find a visible button. What will take you to the check-in page is an hyperlink within a thick text. Excellent! 10 minutes wasted right there, just to find the check-in page. Frustration levels go up. - When you try to choose your seat, a message appears saying you have already chosen it, and then you are allocated a random one. Nice! - If you want to purchase a check in bag you are not given (or at least the info is not straight forward) a list of options with weights and prices to choose from. There seems to be only one purchasing option, with unspecified weight. As a budget airline user, you might end up thinking that, if the information is not there, maybe Alitalia doesn't charge different fees for different weights. So you go ahead and make your purchase. Nervous about not knowing what is the maximum weight for your check-in baggage, you try to browse the complicated site to find the information. Unsuccessfully. Frustration levels go even further up. You check the email confirmation where all the details are summed up, aside from the maximum weight of your baggage. At that point, 30 minutes after having began the whole check-in+baggage purchase process, you give up, and you go to the airport, where you get charged 60€ because your suitcase is heavier than what it was supposed to be. But how heavy was it supposed to be? I needed to get to the airport to find out. I should have asked Google, not Alitalia's website. The staff on-board weren't the kindest I've experienced. Some of the stewardesses wouldn't even smile while carrying out their duties, and the general level of English was quite poor, which is saddening for an airline. Lastly, remember that legroom you had heard of? Forget about it. With reclining seats, if the passenger in front of you reclines the seat, your legroom reduces drastically and your knees are going to hurt in no time! So overall, what was supposed to be an affordable flight with a high end airline and high end experience, turned out to be unexpectedly annoying and stressful. All that I've experienced are some of the most frustrating things for a frequent flyer, such as having to pay more for any information you did look for, but were unable to find after quite some time spent browsing. I will happily go back to flying with budget airlines and encourage other travelers to do so!

### "such uncomfortable seats"
Poor experience with Alitalia on Moscow-Rome-Naples-Palermo-Moscow route. Disorganised check-in in Moscow and Naples, where very few counters were open, led to very long waiting time. Moscow to Rome was delayed for 50 minutes for no apparent reason. Flight crew were quite nice, but the food was appalling - only a small muffin on a 3.5 hour flight is simply unacceptable. No spirits, wine or beer. The aircraft was very old, some seats had duct tape around the armrests. Seat pitch was uncomfortable, though after asking the crew I was reseated to another row. Due to the delay I have missed the connection to Naples and had to be rebooked to the next flight, which only came 4,5 hours later. I was given a food voucher for a sandwich, some fruit and a soft drink, but nothing else. Have filed a claim, still haven't heard back in a week. Rome-Naples - A319 with a truly appalling seat pitch - I have never experienced such uncomfortable seats. Most passengers could not sit in these at all, everyone was twisted sideways. No service whatsoever, not even water. Naples-Palermo - Embraer E-175 with surprisingly comfortable seats and decent cabin, service consisted of soft drinks only. Palermo-Moscow - A320 with, once again, uncomfortable seats. I was lucky to sit in an emergency exit row, though the pitch honestly was more or less the same as the pitch on premium airlines in standard economy seat. Service consisted of a small ham sandwich (flight duration is 4 hours), my requested special meal never came. Full drinks service, including wine. The crew on this flight were apathetic, with no intent to smile or create a pleasant experience, though all requests were quickly dealt with. Overall, Alitalia is not an airline I wish to fly with, considering its current state, but for the price (and the price for these flights - with luggage - was around 150 EUR in total) it was acceptable.

### "will gladly use Alitalia again"
This was a second part of a journey from from Cagliari to London via Milan. This flight was delayed but only by about 40 minutes due to the late arrival of the inbound aircraft. I really enjoyed this flight but was not so happy with the very crowded transfer bus and the stampede to board and people with far too much hand luggage! The cabin crew were very nice and the Embraer city liner was ideal for this length of flight. The interior was nicely decorated in Alitalia colours and I must say the flight was quiet. Arrival into London City was well managed and the crew bid passengers farewell. I will gladly use Alitalia again. The hot drink served was appreciated.

### "was a bit apprehensive"
Rome to Catania. First time on Alitalia as part of a trip from Düsseldorf to Catania via Rome. I only learned of the insolvency of the airline after booking so was a bit apprehensive. But everything turned out fine. We were assigned an emergency exit seat without any cost and were served a drink for free. Took off too late because of typical Italian discussions about hand luggage. I don't understand why they allow hand luggage bigger than my luggage on hold on board. Took ages before it was settled because the plane was full. Arrived only five minutes too late in Catania though. All in all it was a good flight. The only reason why I don't recommend is the insolvency.

### "mediocre to bad flight"
New York to Rome. I have flown Alitalia for years, but it is just getting worse. I thought by upgrading to premium economy it would be much better, but no. For twice the price of economy, you do get easy check-in (thank God, because economy check-in must take about an hour), but after that, very little difference. The seats are a bit larger wth 7 seats across instead of 9, but they are just as hard and uncomfortable. The food is the same as economy , which is awful. I love Italian culture, particularly the food, but how can the national airline of Italy have such bad food? (All 4 meals round trip). And beware Americans, this airline does not stock vodka on board, even for an 11 hour flight. Also, flight attendants are cool and impersonal, very un-Italian. As far as in flight entertainment was concerned I had never heard of any of the films on offer. Overall, a mediocre to bad flight experience.

### "seems like issue of overbooking"
Paris to New Delhi via Rome. Alitalia is starting operations in India from 30th October 2017. I had booked tickets in July for my travel to Switzerland and Paris then return back to Delhi. Booked with this airline as the tickets were cheap. But now they are changing my return dates. Orginal return is on 27th Nov they changed it to 26th Nov without informing me. Now their new email says your flight for 26th has also been cancelled, please contact (a telephone number is given) to change your reservation. When contacted they don't speak English (just Italian, i don't understand italian). When you will check the website for the tickets on same date, tickets were available but were 5 times more costly than for what i have booked. Clearly seems like issue of overbooking and making out money by cheating on customers. Really bad experience before flying, god help me don't know what the flying experience would be.

### "food is a salty or sweet snack"
Palermo to Amsterdam via Milan. Flying Alitalia was a horrible experience for me. There is nothing positive to mention. Badly organised boarding, rude, impatient and cranky cabin crew. The food is a salty or sweet snack, the sweet is kind of ok, the salty is tasteless. Drinks of sodas, coffee or tea only. There is no legs pace. Even creating a bit more space by removing the magazines didn't give me enough space to sit straight. And they wanted me to put my laptop backpack below my seat.

### "Alitalia was probably the worst ever"
Tokyo to London via Rome. I have done 8 long haul flights this year and my Alitalia flight from Tokyo to London was probably the worst ever. The cabin was really hot. Rude staff. Horrible food. Old plane, some things were literally falling apart. My seat didn't work properly. 2h after take off (on a 12h journey) I asked for a can of beer and I heard 'there is no more beer, everyone is drinking beer, we only have wine' so I asked for a glass of wine, got half a cup. Asked for a bit more wine an hour later and this unhappy face came to me and said 'this is gonna be the last one!'. I asked why, she said 'we are not allowed to serve too much wine to the same person'. I didn't want to start arguing but I was fuming. People pay quite a lot of money for those flight tickets and the last thing you need is seeing that miserable face and feel bad every time you need to ask for help. Honestly do yourself a favour and chose different airlines. I don't think I will ever fly with Alitalia again.

### "seats very narrow and uncomfortable"
Rome to Los Angeles. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. The flight was fully booked, upon boarding it was very hot in the cabin and smelt horrible. The Economy attendants were rude and impatient! Hours would go by and no one was in the cabin, after 3 hours with no one checking, I walked to the back and asked for water, obviously an inconvenience since the attendants were rude! The seats were very narrow and uncomfortable which is saying a lot since I'm just over 5 ft tall and 155lbs. If you are of any reasonable height, expect zero leg room! I will never fly Alitalia again! Worst experience we've ever had!

### "One of the worst major airlines"
Rome to New York JFK on a Boeing 777-200. One of the worst major airlines I have experienced. The lines to check in stretched about 100 feet. No clear signage where to go. Obnoxious Alitalia attendants. Flight left the gate over a half an hour late for no apparent reason but inefficiency. Seats are the narrowest I ever experienced on transatlantic (Norwegian's are better).

### "but refused compensation"
I had to fly with this company between Geneva and Rome on September 2, 2017 at 7:00. I receive an sms on September 1st at 9 pm to tell me that the flight is canceled for no reason and to contact customer service. Unfortunately at 9pm the French customer service is closed, I had to call the customer service in Italy which cost me dear. I was offered no solution other than the refund but I had to go to Rome for the weekend so I took another very expensive ticket as it was the day before departure for Rome via Swiss. I contacted Alitalia on my return to obtain the refund but above all the legal compensation of 250 euros for a canceled flight not notified within 14 days before the date of departure. I got the refund of the tickets but refused compensation under the pretext that the weather was bad on Rome and so there were exceptional circumstances. This is where it hurts even more because it was a big blue sky over Rome and the Swiss company that brought us to Rome had no problems.

### "choose a different airline"
Amsterdam to Rome. An utterly ridiculous experience with this airline. The experience is that of a low cost budget airline.. Flights leaves 3-4 hours late. No food served except for a pack of sweet or salty (I still cannot understand how Italy famous for its food can offer the passengers of its national carrier a sole option of either something salty or something sweet (literally, that's how crew members ask you what would you prefer to have). Drinks are limited to very few poor choices - apricot juice, Coke, orange juice or 7 UP. No Italian wine or any other alcohol drink is available. I love Italy and I have heard about Alitalia from others but did not believe what I was hearing because my image of Italy and the description of Alitalia by others did not match. When it comes to flying, if you have a choice, choose a different airline.

### "clean aircraft, nice crew"
I have flown with Alitalia for years and never posted a review, but against all criticism the airline receives I felt I should share my positive experience on this last round trip to the USA. I have flown economy Rome to Miami and back, clean aircraft, nice crew, edible (may be scarce) food, 3 services going west and dinner/breakfast going east. IFE not spectacular but many good films, orderly and relaaxed boarding both at MIA and FCO. Only shortfalls, seats a bit hard for the 10 plus hour flight and toilets not in top condition already at midflight. Having flown the North Atlantic many times also with American, United, Delta and US Airways, I think Alitalia is at least on a par with Delta and far superior to the other US heritage airlines. Both flights departed on time and arrived ahead of schedule.

### "I was very disappointed"
Rome to Cagliari. I was very disappointed from check in, and me and my friend flew together and the lady that booked our tickets did not seat us together. I paid for our tickets together so they should book us together in seats. I paid for my tickets 4 weeks early. Then the staff were leaving, and leaving the lines at check in full. I am very dissatisfied at how they do not move people through with a purpose.

### "have never experienced a problem"
Flew Milan Linate to Amsterdam. I always fly with Alitalia and have never experienced a problem on board their aircrafts. Cabin crew very kind and flight is always on time. Their airport lounges are very nice and the food is very good. I've also flown business class and can just recommend flying with them. Their club MilleMiglia works very well.

### "handled our forced cancellation"
This is not about a flight it is about the superb way Alitailia customer services handled our forced cancellation of a flight from Brindisi to Athens, my mother died and they handled the cancellation with efficiency and refunded the costs in a very timely manner, full marks to them.

### "my luggage was missing"
Milan Linate to Paris Orly. My flight (5.20pm) was canceled because of technical problems, I was first rescheduled on a flight to Paris Char de Gaulle (10.45 pm) and as I was a business traveller rescheduled on a flight to Orly leaving at 8.20 pm which took off at 10pm). Once arrived at Orly, my luggage was missing and I immediately did the baggage claim at the airport. From that moment, every day Alitalia's call center operators kept on calling me in the morning saying that my luggage was found, and when in the evening nothing happened, I called them back and the answer was always: "sorry, you luggage is still in research" - after 2 weeks, they finally found it in Orly, and from sept. 14 they keep on calling me saying that my luggage is arriving with the flight of the evening (9.35 pm). I went at the airport at that time, but the my luggage was still in Paris. I call them back, and they said that there where no room for my luggage in the airplane, it has happened also yesterday (15th) and today (16th). The last news is that "maybe" it will arrive tomorrow (17th) in the morning. In I bought new clothes and other utilities, sent them the receipts as they told me to do, but they never replied. I never experienced this kind of service.

### "far from my expectation"
It was as Business Class but I'm not sure with the seat because it's same with seat configuration of Economy Class with blocked for middle seat. No personal TV screen and without power supply. For a short flight, maybe it's enough but it's too far from my expectation for Business Class . Next other time I prefer Economy Class for aircraft with this seat configuration.

### "worst flying experience"
London to Milan return. Flight late by over 30 mins out and back. Insist on all hand luggage (except trolley bags) under seat - but no legroom and they charge extra for checked bags. Shambolic ground staff. No food available for purchase, only drinks are juice, water, tea and coffee. The worst flying experience in years!

### "worst flight experience ever"
London to Abu Dhabi via Rome. The worst flight experience ever. Firstly our luggages were lost when we got to Rome. No overnight bag was issued to us in Rome. When we got to Abu Dhabi one of our luggage was located damaged. Customer service have no idea what happened. For 6 days in Abu Dhabi, our luggage were not found. I called every day only to be told I will be call back. I spent almost all our travel money on replacing some of the items in my luggage. On our return to UK, I continued to contact the airline. They started a claim case only to discard it without inform me. I have sent many emails to Alitalia with no result. No response even after I sent them the requested receipts. 5 months later, I feel the need to write this review. I will never recommend Alitalia to my worst enemy left alone friends and families.

### "do not care about customers"
In March I was flying from Split to Buenos Aires via Rome by Alitalia. Check in my suitcase in Split to my final destination Montevideo. When I landed in Buenos Aires, lady call me to info desk and she told me that my suitcase stuck in Rome airport. Since then till today I didn't saw my suitcase and I didn't received any money for lost. Till June I was sending e-mails to alitalia but they stop replying. Don't use this airline because they do not care about their customers. I'm trying to avoid any flight where Alitalia is involved.

### "not satisfied with service"
Rome to Malaga. Because it was Alitalia ticket we could not check in online in Belgrade and we have to go earlier to the Airport to check in. They were waiting one hour to serve drinks in snack to avoid to serve passengers twice, even that was flight longer than 2 hours. They did not serve alchohol drinks, only non alcohol and some snacks. I am not satisfied with service. There is no flight entertaiment or wifi service (paid or free)

### "Service was marginal"
The evening flight from Rome to Amsterdam was very empty, only 35 were seats taken. Crew were very friendly and the flight arrived on time despite a slight delay in Rome. Service was marginal. Drink options were water, Cola and orange juice. Snack options were 'something sweet or salt'. I opted for the salt and it was a small bag of Italian cookies. I expected more from a national legacy carrier. Legroom on the Alitalia Airbus A321 is decent but not generous.

### "aircraft is comfortable, service just basic"
We booked our tickets Toronto to Rome on AZ 651, to leave Toronto at 22.45. The day before the flight we were informed that the flight had been cancelled and replaced by AZ8651, leaving 4 hours later (at 02.50 am). The consequence was that the airport lounge was closed, and dinner was served after departure, in the early morning hours: we chose to have just a light snack, counting on later breakfast (to be served in the late afternoon, Europe time), but then breakfast was just coffee. Obviously, the connecting transportation from Fiumicino was missed. No explanations or apologies were offered. Apart from that, the aircraft is comfortable, service just basic. One would expect more when travelling in Business Class.

### "I get a bid to upgrade"
Tel Aviv to Chicago via Rome. I had booked a flight and the cheapest was a combination of economy, premium economy, and business. Weeks before I get a bid to upgrade, and I do so from premium economy to business on the long hauls. I bid the lowest, and it gets accepted. 165 eur from premium economy to business. Not bad. It was worth it because the seat I had in premium economy was 8L which has bad legroom and I was glad I didn't sit there. It has the divide in front of you. Yes the food was not Emirates I am sure. But value for money it was spot on. I am tall so my feet would not fit all the way on the completely lie flat seat. But if you are just a bit shorter, it must be amazing and people were sleeping all through. I never flew business in my life. At the end I ask if I can keep the two teaspoons as a souvenir. Before disembarking the flight attendant taps on my shoulder and offers me a bag. Two teaspoons is not enough. With lots of affection to you". There is a coffee cup set inside.

### "I did not enjoy the flight"
Paris to Skopje via Rome. The plane on the first leg from Paris to Rome was a very old and not well maintained A321. The staff seemed to be rather listless. Despite of having an exit row seat, I did not enjoy the flight. The plane arrived slightly late in Rome and had an outside parking position, which made the connection rather stressful because I had a short connection time. The second leg was much better with a new E170 and friendly staff. On the way back, I also had a positive experience on both legs. If the price is right, I would not exclude taking Alitalia again, but there are definitely better European airlines.

### "Leg room, seat recline were fantastic"
A fantastic flight. I got a premium economy seat by biding online thru their seat bidding system. Got the seat upgrade for 1/3 of the regular price. Wonderful. Leg room, seat recline were fantastic, needed on a long haul flight. Plane was clean, service was great. Food was OK, don't expect much from airline food. I recommend bringing your own snack, buy a sandwich after customs and bring it on the plane, with an extra bottle of water. Entertainment system is dated and the choices are OK. I recommend loading up your tablet with Netflix and music. Bring noise cancelling earphones, they have a power supply so no worries about battery drainage. Overall well done Alitalia. I hope my flight back to Toronto will be as pleasant as the one to Thessaloniki.

### "downgraded me to X class"
Rome to Amsterdam. I bought ticket with economy Y class (full economy) and it's included luggage for round trip AMS-FCO-AMS. The first leg from AMS-FCO was smooth, but the 2nd leg was terrible. I did check-in online and had boarding pass (with Y class), but when I came to airport they did not allow me to attach luggage. Staff did not know how to smile, how to say sorry, they just know how to say "I don't know". Then, they reprinted new boarding pass with X class and required me to pay 40eur for my luggage. I asked a lady who was in check-in procedure why my boarding pass which I checked-in online was Y class, but they downgraded me to X class, she just say "I don't know", "You must pay".

### "Alitalia's website is useless"
Palermo to Rome. I booked a ticket that was categorized as "Economy" through a third-party supplier. On the Alitalia website, "Economy" is a separate category from "Light" (in the latter, there is no checked baggage allowance). When I went to do my online check-in on the Alitalia website, my fare class was written as "Economy" not "Light", suggesting that I had a checked bag included. In fact, when I went into the section to purchase checked baggage, the website was charging me 60 euro (as if I were looking to have a second bag) instead of 25 euro (which is supposed to be the price for adding a bag online, in advance, on the Alitalia website, when you have a "Light" fare). On the basis of this information that I checked and double-checked on the Alitalia website itself, I did not do a checked baggage advanced purchase. When I arrived at the terminal, I was advised that I was not allowed checked baggage without paying. I had taken screenshots of the check-in for the website and I showed them to the incredibly rude customer service representative, to no avail. I had to pay 48 euro at Palermo airport. They kept asking me over and over why I hadn't paid for the bag online - I tried multiple times to explain how the website was charging me 60 euro (even less than the airport cost), so why would I ever have paid that online. I note that the same thing regarding the website check-in and baggage cost happened on both my inbound and outbound flights on this same ticket. The ticket was listed on the Alitalia website itself as "Economy" fare, not light. I sent a complaint to Alitalia by e-mail (you can only e-mail with complaints from Canada, no telephone number) a month ago and have received no response. All I'm asking for is a refund of the difference between the airport price and online price for baggage. I'm happy to pay for the baggage, but should not be more out of pocket because Alitalia's website is useless and the counter staff lack any understanding of the online check-in process.

### "purchase luggage allowance"
Milan to Paris. I purchased the ticket via skyscanner but was not sure if I would have to purchase luggage allowance or not. The confirmation showed that it was economy so i decided not to pay for that. At Paris airport, they said I could load my bag as it was included. At Milan Linate airport, the lady at the check in counter said I had to pay €45. I asked for the manager, she came and said I had to pay with no choice or they wouldn't check me in. If I knew from skyscanner  that I had to pay for the checked luggage, I would do it online without paying double at the check in. How could i fly to Milan with my luggage if i had to pay? The staff didn't try to solve any problem but made me pay with no other choice.

### "would not recommend Alitalia "
Rome to Toronto. This flight, as well as the flight from Toronto to Rome was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever experienced. The seats felt like wood, and, although I was very gratefully given another seat, which was one of the preferred seats, it was hard. The original seat was very close to the bathroom and even the air conditioning blowing was impossible to stop the smell. Both flights were filthy. The blankets smelled rotten. The original flight from Toronto to Rome had seating so tight you could hardly get through the row. I would not recommend Alitalia in economy class.

### "not overly impressed"
Round trip flight between New York JFK and Rome with Alitalia. To our pleasant surprise both flights departed and arrived on time. (We also took two domestic flights and those too operated as per scheduled timings). Overall, the experience was disappointing. The cabin was rather warm, the flight attendants were brusque and absent for the most part, the food options limited, the IFE was rather complicated to use with a limited selection, the seat narrow, space for keeping one's personal effects was non-existent and the toilets were either untidy or lacked toilet paper. There was nothing distinctivess about the duty free offerings. The flights were smooth and the cockpit kept us apprpriately updated. The seat was comfortable with various massage features. The cabin in 1-2-1 layout was spacious and clean. In sum, it was a basic, functional product lacking any distinctiveness save for an Italian flair. The only reason we chose Alitalia was to start our holiday in Italy with a taste of Italy in the air. And we got that and was not overly impressed.

### "Don't fly with them"
Geneva to Catania via Geneva and I was unable to check-in online. The airline counter at Geneva was only able to check me in until Rome and informed me that I will have to check-in for Catania at Rome. I expressed my anxiousness as to whether the transit desk at Rome will be able to check me in time before the gate closes, to which the person at the counter informed me that I needn't go to the transit desk but go directly to the gate and ask for the boarding pass. At Rome, i ran to the gate, only to be hand waved into going to the transit desk. There was a long queue of passengers ahead of me, and just one person manning the transit desk. After an hour of waiting, with just 10 minutes for the gate to close i was handed a boarding pass that said I was on standby and was asked to join another queue that simply said 'standby list'. With two minutes left to the gate closing, another kind employee of alitalia informed me that I will have to go back to the transit desk and informed me without any explanations that I will not be able to travel on that flight. After standing in a queue for the third time the transit desk guy informed me that there's nothing he could do and asked me to go to the Alitalia counter at arrivals saying they would provide me accommodations and an alternative flight. After standing in that queue for a further 45mins, I was told that I will have to go to the Alitalia counter at departures since apparently this counter could do nothing to help me (why inform me to go there in the first place?). At the queue at the departures counter, after a final wait of a bit more than an hour, I was handed my accommodation voucher and 'dinner' voucher at 1am the next day. Awesome. I arrived at Rome at 8:30pm and had spent 4h30mins standing in lines to nowhere and running between counters, with not so much of an apology. Your plans don't matter. It doesn't matter if you are tired and starving. You are simply one amongst the 100 others that missed Alitalia's flights, because they can't be bothered to have more than one person at any given counter. Don't fly with them or be ready to be in a similar situation :)

### "service onboard is reduced to a minimum"
The airline is going from worse snd worse. Flew from Rome FCO to Prague. In the past it was a very pleasant experience to fly this Italian brand. They removed all their inflight entertainment systems and now I was surprised their service onboard is reduced to a minimum in regards with the ticket price. They used to serve a nice sandwich and later a snack and variety of drinks. Now on the last 4 flights I have taken with them, they serve only water or cola (no juice) and a small snack. The seats are not clean and stylish anymore and it is no longer nice to fly Alitalia. Their crew are very elegant and professional though.

### "quick, smooth, on time flight"
Catania to Rome, Alitalia flight departed and arrived on schedule. The plane was almost full but there was enough overhead bin space for luggage. Each of us had two carry on bags - no extra charge. We were also able to pre-select our seats. The space between the rows was rather tight when the passenger in front decides to recline. Announcements were made in both Italian and understandable English. Flight attendants were efficient. A cup of water or soda was served to all passengers from a trolley. The downside of this flight was that both at departure and at arrival at Rome, the plane was parked at a remote bay necessitating the use of a bus. At Catania one had to walk down two flights of stairs in the open to board the bus. Being in Group 1 did not matter as the passengers were herded into the bus and when we arrived at the plane, everyone rushed out to climb the stairs to the plane! Overall, it was a quick, smooth, on time flight.

### "forced to have only 1 carry on"
Milan to Rome. The worst airline and will never fly with this company ever again. The service at check in is horrible and not equal. Some customers are forced to have only 1 carry on, then at boarding you see so many people with 2-3 carry-ons. The policies are not applied fairly. Very very bad airline.

### "they did not make any contact with me"
First the transit hall in Rome was so far away and then when I arrived my luggage was lost. After registering the lost luggage and getting the  form on 26 March, until today which is about 2 months passed, they did not make any contact with me anymore and did not inform either they found or want to pay compensation for it. I have sent many email, fax and mail to their customer service in Germany and Italy but no response.

### "a delay from Casablanca"
Casablanca to Malta via Rome. First we had a delay from Casablanca so we missed the connection. Then the person at the desk of Alitalia which he supposed to book again our connection to Malta he booked and cancelled the booking at the same time. We had a ticket in our hands which was not valid for check in. After more than an hour running from desk to another they decieded to book all of us again but there wasnt enough space for the 5 of us. We were told that if some of the passegers dont show up we can get on the plane. We stayed at the gate till the last moment and some passengers didnt show up because of another delay.

### "has not been any apology"
Paris to Milano. Sad to say that my experience is very dissapointing. I arrived at 6h00 at CDG airport with a scheduled flight at 7h30. After several fail attempts to check into my flight I go to an Alitalia counter. The very nice lady kindly directed me to the Air France counter because my flight was supposedly operated by them. After an hour of looking for my flight, (they could not find my name in the system,) they finally realized that my flight had been changed to an earlier time and I had not been informed of this change. I went to an Alitalia counter at the airport, where I had to deal with a very unpleasant attendant. I was nothing but polite to her when I explained my situation and all she said to me was, "it is 7h05 you would've missed your flight anyway. To which I responded, "yes, because I have been bounced off from counter to counter for the last hour. Without any explanation, or communication, she wrote some numbers on a piece of a paper and said "your new ticket. I asked if my return flight had also changed. Once again, no communication whatsover she wrote more numbers on the piece of paper. I had to once again ask how am I supposed to get my boarding pass, and she said "counter 3, have a nice day. I was the only person in the room, so is not like she had more people to take care of. This all happened at the purchasing tickets counter. Once again, the lady at the check-in counter was nice and gave me my boarding pass. When my second flight finally boarded, ahead of schedule I should point out. They tell us they have "some issues they have to take care of. I do not understand how is it possible for them to board an entire plane and then take care of issues. On top of that, the flight is now 20 minutes delayed. I wrote this entire review sitting on your plane. Perhaps my experience will change after departure, but as of right now, there has not been any apology, or explanation from your crew or company in regards to the time and business of your customers. I understand stuff happens, and sometimes is out of our control. But if your company decides to change a flight and not communicate it with the passengers. They least the attendand could've done was to apologize for the inconvenience.

### "Really pleasant flight"
New York to Milan. Really pleasant flight on Alitalia, the in flight Business product is above par. Their lounge in NYC urgently needs a facelift, it looks like being thrown back to the 90s and this impacts the overall image that the airline is trying to build. Boarding was average, only one door used on the 330 to let everyone in so although priority boarding is enforced if you don't arrive immediately then it feels like "everyone in". There has been a discussion over the crew new outfit, I feel it is elegant and looks very Italian. Cabin layout is a staggered 1-2-1 with direct aisle access; seats are extremely comfortable with the new poltrona frau leather cover. The best of Alitalia is inflight service though, sometimes the crew might be not as "friendly" as expected, this time was perfect. Regional Italian food and wines (Friuli Venezai Giulia and Sicily) were really good, served on Frette tablecloth and Richard Ginori china and silverware. Seat was comfortable, IFE maybe slightly short in offering of movies but enough for a 8 hours flight. Amenity kit was large (and it converts into a stylish iPad case), with selection of Bvlgari products. Overall a good experience, I hope new destinations will be served out of Italy so that I can fly Alitalia again.

### "good way to fly long distance"
Sao Paulo to Rome. Premium Economy with Alitalia is a fabulous product. Excellent legroom, comfortable seat. Food was served on plates not in an economy style carton. Nice touches provided like a liquor and espresso with meal, hot towel before meal. Cabin is separated and feels spacious. As it is separate there is also plenty of overhead luggage space. Food was good. Price was also very reasonable maybe 15% higher than what i would expect to pay for an economy ticket on this route. Very pleased, this is definitely a good way to fly long distance.

### "I cannot trust this airline"
Flight from Athens to Rome delayed to arrive in Athens. Alitalia said they will catch up time on air trip. On arrival at Fiumicino our connecting flight supposed to have been departed (AZ1759) 3 minutes ago, meanwhile not any records on the departure flight board. Rescheduled to AZ1719 (next flight out) for departure on 03-04-2017 at 21:50. On arrival at Catania airport, my luggage didn't arrive. Spent 2 hours waiting to submit a baggage claims and finally I got my luggage back the next late evening (04-04-2017) while on the early morning of April 5th I was flying back to Athens. Beverages: Only water and orange juice with a small satchel of snack (biscotti or salatini). Service very poor I cannot trust this airline.

### "Alitalia is a nightmare"
New York  to Milan. Got to JFK after 3 delays by Delta. Ran through terminals to get to Alitalia, but we didn't get there until 9:12pm and our flight was scheduled to depart at 9:45pm. The Alitalia rep told us they had already closed the door to the plane. No other flights were going to Milan. No hotel or other remuneration was provided. Delta got us on a flight to Paris with Air France and then to Milan. Alitalia lost our luggage and we were charged by the car service for the ride we couldn't take. At this time we are wearing the same clothes we left home in (day 4). We've been told our bags were located and "promised" we'd get them later today. Conclusion, Alitalia is a nightmare.

### "horrible company to fly with"
London to Rio de Janeiro return via Rome. Alitalia was a horrible company to fly with. I was extremely disappointed with the service as well as everything to do with the flight. The food was poor, the seats  extremely uncomfortable. It's unbelievable to think you could fly for 12 hours in those conditions paying the amount of money you pay. . And to top It all off they give these horrible blankets, that did not look like they were clean. I would not fly with them again and would not recommend to anyone.

### "very attentive and friendly cabin crew"
Flew Alitalia from Milan to Havana via Rome. Flight very pleasant, speedy boarding, very clean aircraft cabin, large and comfortable seat with large screen and inflight entertainment with many games, TV programmes and movies, and fast Wi-fi on board. Very attentive and friendly cabin crew, typically delicious Italian food served in abundant quantity and followed by an excellent selection of Italian wines. Best ever inflight espresso coffee, you can also choose the blend.

### "Alitalia  never again"
Rome to São Paulo. Horrible to do check in. Horrible food and drinks served on the flight, and an old entretainment system, rude staff. Alitalia  never again, even if its the cheapest. I couldn't do check online, so I had to arrive 3 hours before. I had to travel in the middle seat and being 1,92m it was horrible.

### "don't fly again with Alitalia"
Bologna to Miami via Rome. I flew in premium economy from Rome to Miami. The positive notes are good aircraft, seats in premium economy very comfortable, and good entertainment. Staff service attention was non-existent; we were abandoned for 4 hours. They never passed even with a glass of water for the flights, except when served meals. A lady in front of us used the bell for 4 times and only after 1 hour arrived and were also annoyed because she had disturbed. We could not use the bathroom of premium class because there was always the row of economy passengers. The food was terrible. The crew doesn't know the difference between economy and economy premium, when I tried to talk with them, they said " what you want, you are in economy". I paid a supplement to fly in premium because I will have the benefits but I received none of these. I was curious to try Alitalia and my curiosity is satisfaction that I don't fly again with Alitalia. On the return, we had a crew worthy to be called so present, polite, courteous and professional (the catering a little better because out of USA ) - my review is only for Rome to Miami on the outbound flight. Alitalia, if you want to win new customers you have to change many things, starting from a review and control on your staff.

### "a good experience"
It was a good experience in Alitalia  business class flight from Mexico to Rome. The lounge in Mexico City Airport was very large, comfortable armchairs to relax, super buffet and well stocked. Very friendly staff. Onboard the crew were caring for passengers and available. The menu with good selection of drinks, good and abundant during the whole flight. Comfortable seats, nice toiletries and many films made this a very positive experience. E' stata una bella esperienza questo volo in business con Alitalia dal messico a roma. Il lounge riservato a citta del messico e' molto ampio, comode poltrone per rilassarsi, abbondante buffet super rifornito. Molto gentile il personale sempre s disposizione. In aereo il personale di bordo si e' dimostato attento ai passeggeri e a disposizione. Il menu con ottima scelta di bevande tra un cui un ottimo ferrari e' molto buono ed abbondante durante tutto il volo. Comode poltrone letto e bel kit cortesia e tanti film,allietano il viaggio. Esperienza molto positiva.

### "good flight with horrible service"
Belgrade to Rome. I booked an economy flight but took part in the auction to be upgraded. My trip started very well as I was able to enjoy the very nice  Air Serbia lounge at Belgrade airport. Once aboard I was told by a rather grumpy FA that I wouldn’t be getting a meal as they only had enough meals onboard for the original amount of business class passengers. This is unacceptable as my request was granted at 9 am with the flight leaving only at 6pm. I got to try some of the food (my colleague traveling with me shared his portion) and it was dreadful. A real shame for a country with a rich culinary tradition like Italy. The flight itself was nice and smooth and the seats comfortable. We also arrived on time. All in all a good flight with horrible service. Had I paid the full business fare, I would have been furious.

### "such a bad experience"
London to Rio de Janeiro return via Rome. First and last time flying with Alitalia, I have never had such a bad experience. Seats very uncomfortable, I couldn't find any position to get some sleep due to a lack of space. 11 hours of discomfort was a complete torture. Food on the way to Brazil the food was disgusting and we couldn't choose anything else because they didn't have enough food, on the return to Rome it was ok. Crew not nice, including one particular staff was very rude towards me with no reason. Definitely the worst service I have ever had, and I don't recommend Alitalia to anyone!

### "the flight was terrible"
Flew from Santiago de Chile to Rome in economy class and I thought the flight was terrible! The seats are small and because the headrest is not incorporated in the seat, it makes you sit in an awkward position with your head tilted forward. Extremely uncomfortable for a 15hr flight! The window seat has a metal box in front of it so there is no possibility of stretching your legs properly. Also uncomfortable. Spending such a long time on a plane is not very nice but one would at least expect the flight attendants to walk around with water. This was not the case. Once it was time to have a meal, the flight attendants serving the food were rude and did not speak english. What really struck me is that they didn't even have enough food for everyone and started giving out different trays. For example I had a little sandwich (butter and cheese in white bread), a cookie and an olive bread whilst my neighbor only got a strange looking green baguette sandwich. A plane has a certain number of seats and there should be sufficient food for everyone. Overall, I was disappointed. There was no organization and even though the price was quite good, never again will I fly with this airline.

### "spoiled by the flight attendants"
Rome to Santiago de Chile last week, and it is a long flight, more than 14 hours and it's impossible not arrive tired at your destination. We flew in economy class and the aircraft was full, anyway we have been spoiled by the flight attendants who were smiling. Food was distributed very fast and professonally and what surprised me, the taste of my special menu with no lactose. During the flight water and coke were offered many times by flight attendants. The only con is the IFE screen in economy, really really small.

### "everything was perfect"
Flew from Milan Linate to Rome, everything was perfect! Departed on time, served a delicious snack (two options) and was impressed for the quantity of beverage selection for such a short flight. At the aiport the ground staff was helpful and accompanied us to the fast track security line where passengers flying to Rome are invited. New cabin looks fresh and cabin crew were professional and smiling. I think it's still the best option to travel between the two cities, with a very good value for money.

### "food offered was excellent"
London to Beijing via Rome was an unforgettable experience. The lounge in Rome was new, clean and food offered was excellent. The cabin crew made me feel welcome, provided welcome drinks, amenity kit and menus. The Bvlgari amenity kit is very nice-looking and the products inside are above some airlines. The menu on the outbound flight from Rome was Sicilian menu, which I had an attachment to because Sicily was my honeymoon destination. The service contained 5 courses with cheese board and fruits. Each course had a wine paring. The food was amazing and nicely cooked. Cabin service was efficient and requests were fulfilled immediately. I feel the new business class product is excellent from hardware to service provided. The only problem I noticed was the check-in at LHR terminal 4 was quite slow for the Alitalia early morning flights. The queue was massive at economy check-in and there were only 2 counters for sky priority check-in.

### "awful handling of missed connections"
Belgrade to Madrid via Rome. First flight delayed because of snow in Belgrade, but awful handling of missed connections by the Alitalia ground staff in Rome. I will never fly this airline again. The transfer desk was a mess, hundreds of people queuing out of order, staff not bothered to organise anything, unprepared and unprofessional. In addition we were lied to multiple times and they managed to lose our luggage which arrived 3 days later. Impossible to contact the airline without waiting on the phone for ages etc. Never again.

### "very disappointing experience "
Rome to Barcelona. The flight was delayed one hour and a half. When we landed in Barcelona, I couldn't find my suitcase at the baggage claim. I had to raise a claim (at the airport, otherwise you lose all passenger rights) and the long queue almost made me missing my train connection (which was planned for 3 hours after the scheduled flight arrival time). I took a taxi and made it to the airport just when the train was about to depart. The luggage arrived 4 days later, on December 27th. The suitcase was broken and items within the toilet bag were broken, I raised a second claim and the company has been just playing with my team, making me loss my time, with different bureaucracy papers waiting for me to get tired of them. At the end they offered me a voucher of 250€ to spend in flight with them, but no compensation. No refund for any  expenses. Very disappointing experience and behavior during the claim. I will definetely will try to avoid to fly with this airline as much as possible.

### "met with a lot arrogance"
On 9 December 2016 I bought a very cheap business class ticket from Florence to Bangkok via Paris and returning via Abu Dhabi to Dusseldorf for flights operated by Air France and Etihad but with Alitalia flight numbers and an Alitalia ticket number. A week later I received a phone call from the agency where I bought the ticket. I was told that Alitalia had changed my reservation and that I should contact it. I checked online and indeed Alitalia had changed my reservation to a one-way flight from FLR to DUS via FCO with the departure on 12 Jan. My original departure was to be on 11 Jan. I contacted Alitalia, which was not easy - their HQ in Italy can only be contacted by phone or fax which makes it difficult to launch a written complaint and thus prevents you from acquiring any written evidence of communication in case you may need it. I wrote an email to their Customer Relations Office in the Czech Republic (which can only be contacted by email or fax). I received a reply with a phone number inviting me to call them. Only after I asked for a written reply to my complaint, my claim was registered and I received a claim number. On the phone I was told that there was an error in their reservation system which made it possible to book flights from FLR to DUS with unusual routings and because they made a mistake, I am not going to Bangkok. So far my claim has not been resolved. I only met with a lot arrogance, excuses and incompetence and with the departure date approaching, I had to cancel the FLR-DUS ticket and ask for a refund.

### "definitely do not recommend"
Moscow to Bordeaux via Rome. The worst company ever! I never had such a bad experience in my travel life. Never again go with Alitalia and definitely do not recommend it to the others. Flight delay more than 6 hour without any notice what has happened. The crew is very poor and not friendly, didn't supply the food and accommodation, didn't change the flight for the passenger with connections! Very poor management in the force major situations.

### "the crew was very poor"
Berlin to Venice. The only positive aspect is the scheduled and arriving times. The Aircraft was clean enough. When I boarded none of the cabine crew said hello or good morning, none of them helped passengers during the accomodation of cabin luggages, no one helped families with children or babies. Immediately before take off, the crew did not control if all passengers has fasten their seat belt. The crew was disorganized during the distribution of meals. In summary, the crew was very poor. Food was terrible!

### "no complaints at all"
No complaints at all. Crew professional. Food nice. Seats ok. Inflight entertainment good. Blankets and cushions provided. Some small delay when leaving but made up during the flight. Good connection in Rome. Passport control for EU citizens fully automatised, fast security clearance and plenty of bars, food and nice shops. Price of the ticket was extremely cheap (I was really lucky). When returning from Tehran to Brussels I had to pay 75 Euro for excess bagage but as my suitcase was almost 31 kilo (23 kilo allowed), I found this quite reasonable and not an issue of discussion. Alitalia was a good experience and I would certainly consider flying with them again in the future.

### "Alitalia has had a nice change"
Amsterdam to Rome. Flight pleasant and comfortable. The service was efficient and friendly, we landed in Rome with 10 minutes early. Being a flight of under two hours, it was served a sandwich choice between vegetarian and meat, as well as unlimited drinks. Alitalia has had a nice change from a few years ago.

### "service was quick but not rushed"
Abu-Dhabi to Amsterdam Schiphol with a transfer in Rome FCO. I attempted to check-in with the mobile APP only to find out that I had to check in at the Airport, my boarding passes were issued within seconds at a dedicated check in counter for all premium classes which also provided a dedicated routing through security and immigration. Alitalia uses the Etihad lounge which looks very nice with a great choice of food, drinks and all other kinds of amenities. Boarding started early and was by Bus. Economy and Business passengers were transported to the aircraft in different busses. To be fair, I did not like the attitude of the Etihad ground crew, they chose to be impolite to most of the passengers. Finger snapping and shouting is unacceptable. The A330-200 has a stepped interior which gives all passengers aisle access. These seats are comfortable but my aisle seat did not offer a lot of privacy and room for the storage of personal items. On board an attentive service from a very senior all male cabin crew that offered a good choice of well-presented and tasty snacks immediately after departure and a good breakfast just before arrival. Service was quick but not rushed, allowing all passengers to sleep as long as possible. For this leg we had a non-time departure and arrival I made the transfer to concourse B (Non-Schengen) in about 20 minutes including immigration and a security check allowing me a visit in one of the Alitalia Lounges before boarding the flight to Amsterdam. The flight to Amsterdam was packed and boarding was chaotic. Many passengers did not observe the priority-boarding lane, which resulted in the fact that they were sent to the other lane as soon as they reached the counter. On board again a very attentive service, this time from 2 very senior female flight attendants who offered a breakfast with several rounds of coffee/tea/juice, quit adequate for a 120min. flight. The leg had an on-time departure and arrival. This 2nd leg had a reasonable on-time departure but arrived sharp on time in Amsterdam.

### "I am completely done with it"
Rome to Cairo. My problem with Alitalia started back in the end of October where I purchased online a ticket from FCO to CAI. Although I paid the amount advertised which was on a special offer, I never received confirmation nor my flight ticket. From there on, my ordeal started and is still ongoing. It has been 2 months already that I cannot get my refund nor a clarification whether I am on the flight I booked or not. After numerous calls to the customer service and waiting time around 15’each call, the only answer I am getting is that the airline’s system is down and the soonest it is fixed they will deal with my issue as I am on a queue of around 3000 passengers. Unbelievable and simply ridiculous! Besides having to spent so much time on the phone and only receiving apologies for the inconvenience and no solution, I had to contact the department via email too, and the only answer I have received is that there’s nothing they can do for my problem and the only way to solve it is by phone. This is not a workable solution either. I have spent around 300€ for a flight which I don’t even know if I am on, no information provided, nor explanation or confirmation that I will be refunded. I am beyond frustrated as there seems to not be a solution and for such an enterprise, someone would expect some kind of customer service to say the least. it is a matter of decency, respect and appreciation for the customer to be able to solve such an issue quickly and provide feedback. Apparently Alitalia has no concerns for these principles. After 11 years of flying with this airline, I am completely done with it.

### "I will fly again with Alitalia"
Rome to Amsterdam. Aircraft with the new livery and new style on board and very clean. We started with a few minutes late as a couple of people had not presented, but we arrived in Amsterdam on time. The seats were normal. They served a sandwich to choose between vegetarian or non-vegetarian, very good. I will fly again with Alitalia.

### "Never again with Alitalia"
Malta to Bologna via Rome. Never again with Alitalia. Its almost impossible to gain some information regarding there own mishaps, and when you do they will tell nothing usefull. We had a connection flight with the same airline, however for an unkown reason the flight was delayed. We almost missed the connection flight, but amazingly they were waiting for us. None of the crew or customer service told us that they will be wait for us, on the contrary they gave us the next flight details which was 6 hours later. When we arrived at our destination our luggage was missing so we had to reclaim it (none of the connection flight passenger's luggages arrived.) When we were comming back the same thing happened again, with each flight delayed between 20min to 60min. On a posotive note, landing was very smooth.

### "won't use their service again"
I bought a flight London to Istanbul via Rome with Alitalia, which will be on the 18 of December 2016. Recently I noticed an automatic message from Alitalia in the spam folder that there are changes in my schedule. I called to Alitalia, they said the company can only rebook the flight 5 days later - it is too late for me. Because of this I have to buy flights just 3 weeks before the trip and the cost of flights are double. It is my first experience with Alitalia and I certainly won't use their service again - their schedule isn't stable, the service is poor, they don't appreciate customers' demands.

### "service very bad"
Rome to London with Alitalia. If you can avoid it, avoid it. Service very bad, staff are not polite or nice, not willing to help or to give you information whether at the check-in desk or inflight. I've travelled a lot and that's probably the worst service I've received, Timing - they have been late both times (20mins and 40mins). Quality of seats okay and modern, leg space is decent - not enough space for my luggage so I had to keep it under my seat. Food with no taste, not much choice for drinks (orange juice, coffee or tea). I'd recommend Easyjet or Ryanair instead, that's cheaper and the overall experience is slightly better.

### "getting an invoice seems impossible"
Dusseldorf to Milano Linate with Alitalia. It was business flight, my company requires an invoice and Alitalia does not give them. How does it work? The invoice at Alitalia can be ordered only via telephone (not email). Customer service staff only speak Italian so they do not understand what you say and you have to keep repeating (data of your company, name, adress, tax number and so on). After that, they tell you that invoice will arrive within the next 6-8 weeks. I called after 3 weeks and asked about it and the invoice request was not recorded. I gave all the data again. Same - after 2 weeks phoned again, request not recorded. Made it third time - same, not recorded. Each phone call is about 45min - 1 hour. Getting an invoice seems impossible and of course as company your company pays for the flight it requires the invoice.

### "just really, really bad"
Munich to Buenos Aires via Rome. The worst seats ever for the 10hrs flight between Rome and Buenos Aires - where you have to sleep at one point - the seats were just the worst ever with some weird extension at the level of the head, maybe supposed to make it comfy but was just the opposite. Food was disgusting. I'm normally pretty easy and eat everything, but in this case, I could not. Was just really, really bad. Service is not pleasant, not polite.

### "seats were very comfortable"
Flew Alitalia from Amsterdam to Rome. I received a free upgrade to business class. The seats were very comfortable and I had a lot of room to move my legs and stay relaxed. The cabin was clean and all the interior finitures of the aircraft were renewed, giving a sense of luxury. Very nice lasagne meal even if it was a short flight. The crew were very kind and they passed through several times offering beverages, chocolates or extra bread. The only negative part was a delay of 30 minutes on the boarding.

### "Alitalia's poor service"
New York to Rome flight was pleasant enough. The AVOD was inadequate, but the food was decent, and the flight was one time. Arriving in Rome at 6.30 am, the transfer to the domestic terminal was quick and easy. The problems started when I went to check in at Trieste airport for the return flight. Alitalia personnel stated they could only provide a boarding pass for (and check my bag to) Rome. I would have to get my luggage and check in again in Rome. They could not provide a boarding pass for or check my bag through to JFK. We asked why this was and were told that all flights to the US worked this way. After approximately 50 round trips to Europe, I knew better and told them this. At this point they said there was nothing they could do and that I had tons of time in Rome anyway. They were extremely rude and unprofessional. I wondered if Alitalia was experiencing computer problems which prevented them from offering the standard service. I had 2.5 hours to change planes, and I barely made it. Rome FCO Airport is a real mess with construction and inadequate signage. Everyone leaving on international flights was running around in a panic trying to figure out what was going on. This was made worse by the fact that I had to get my bag, run around with my bag, and then check in again at another terminal. I arrived at the gate dripping with sweat without a chance to get water or use the restroom before boarding the plane. Alitalia's poor service just worsened a bad situation at FCO. The flight was cheap enough, but did I pay otherwise.

### "friendly and professional"
Rome to Bucharest. Even if the weather in Rome was terrible, we boarded and took off on time. Flight assistants were friendly and professional and it was very nice that the Captain made so many announcements. In a 1 h 45 minutes flight, flight assistants passed several times up and down the cabin. The only cons, a screen showing the route would be nice on the short haul Alitalia planes.

### "the service has really improved"
Flew from Rome to Bucharest. Good services, both on ground and in the air. Even if the flight from Rome to Bucharest is quite fast snacks are offered by Alitalia. I really liked the new cabin interiors and uniforms. I would say that the service has really improved during the years and staff are always smiling and friendly.

### "never fly with them again"
Perugia to Brindisi via Roma. Few weeks before our trip they canceled the first flight of the connection (Perugia to Roma) and they replaced it with a bus. Then my first disappointment was that I paid for a flight to actually travel by bus. The bus they scheduled for us was way earlier than the second flight (Roma-= to Brindisi) then we basically arrived to the airport more than 3 hours before, but it's not finished yet. At Fiumicino we realized that an earlier flight to Brindisi (our last destination) was available then we could have avoided waiting so long, but they refused to let us taking it for free after all the discomfort they caused to us and asked something like 50 euros or more to change the flight time. They are such a shame. They have no idea of what customer care is. We'll never fly with them again for sure.

### "never fly Alitalia again"
Palermo to New York JFK via Rome. We will never fly Alitalia again! We were flying with a group of other people. The problems began the day before with computer problems that made it difficult to check in. We all got to the Palermo airport with 2 hours for Check in. There no line to begin Checking in. There was no one to help us. Finally they opened a line for our particular flight, one very long slow line. Staff stood at other desks doing nothing. Finally someone directed people to a second. We were 50 minutes late taking off to Rome. In Rome we got off on the tarmac at one terminal and literally had to run thru the airport to get to our plane to JFK. 7 Members of our group found they had no seats on the plane. They finally got a flight to Boston that evening. Their luggage did not arrive. Their ride home from the airport was at JFK not at Logan Boston. My Brothers luggage arrived at his house Tuesday night. We had Business class seats. On the flight to JFK the seats were a lot tighter and more uncomfortable than the seats on the Alitalia flight from Palermo to Rome. Bad customer service, poor utilization of staff, uncomfortable seats.

### "all in all, not very pleasant"
As Alitalia was the cheapest option from Frankfurt to Rome-Fiumicino, I chose the Italian flag carrier. The check-in / baggage drop took a lot of time and the staff didn't seem very motivated, but they are not from Alitalia of course. As I tracked the plane on it's way to Frankfurt, I realised we will not depart on time. My expectation turned true in the waiting room, where a staff member told us that our plane is half an hour behind schedule. When boarding finally commenced, Alitalia had a good concept in boarding the people efficiently by boarding them in rows, but sadly nobody cared. After finally taking off, the inflight service began about 30 minutes into the flight. This was a big disapointment to me. We were handed a tiny, ice cold sandwich (as provided in the photos) with cream Cheese, spinach and champingnons, which tasted disgusting. The crew also served complimentary drinks. I was expecting more on a 2 hour flight. Also to mention is the bad quality of the English by the cabin crew. During passenger announcements you could barely understand anything. All in all the flight was not very pleasant, mainly due to the delay and the service. Hopefully this will change on the flight back to Frankfurt.

### "nothing to complain about"
Milan to Bucharest via Rome. Have flown a lot with Alitalia, nothing to complain about. Never lost a luggage, although delays might happen, as with this flight. Took more than 1 hour waiting in the plane to depart from FCO. Obviously, as many people don't know or don't want to know, this is not by far the fault of the airline but of the airport traffic in general. About the delay, the captain of this particular flight gave us information in a clear manner and excused at the end of the flight in LIN. Connections are always working well. On a down note, this airline is a bit overpriced and recently cancelled destinations / flights e.g. LIN-OTP. The flight attendants are normal, although they could use some younger staff and change the awful new uniforms. As a general conclusion, the planes are ok, food is ok and the level of English on ground and inflight is average to low.

### "please avoid Alitalia"
Los Angeles to Rome with Alitalia. Worst customer experience ever, both onboard and on the ground in FCO. Staff unfriendly while assisting because their flight was delayed and I missed the connection. Ground staff of Alitalia did not even manage to issue a boarding pass for the flight they rebooked me to automatically! I was running around from service desk to service desk and staff was not able to help due to lack of knowledge, system errors and unavailabilty of right people. It was unbelievable to see 11 Alitalia employees standing around 5 PCs! Please avoid Alitalia!

### "I would avoid Alitalia"
Rome to New York JFK. Alitalia are the worst airline I've seen so far. Cabin crew was rude, indifferent, unavailable for long periods of time, and they made me miss a connecting flight at JFK. There was an Italian family who boarded late, and once there, attempted to move into seats in business and premium economy. The drama that ensued was long and loud and it involved every member of the crew all trying to instruct them to take their assigned seats. They argued, the crew argued and finally, finally the purser convinced them to take their seats. This burned up 40 or 45 minutes of my connection time. We finally landed at JFK and sat on the tarmac for another 45 minutes. During the flight the cabin crew would appear for short periods of time to serve meals, but then go behind their curtains to their seats for hours. Totally unacceptable. The ground crew people were also indifferent and told us that checking in online is required, and if you don't do it they give your seats away. But just try and navigate their web site. It is incomprehensible. I would avoid Alitalia.

### "a bad feeling every time"
Rome to Catania with Alitalia. Again I was disgusted by Alitalia. Arriving at Fiumicino - 3 staff by the check-in area busy chatting with each other. I was in doubt how to enter the queue system as all entreances were blocked and asked them. Wow - did they make me feel I disturbed them. One hardly stopped talking to her colleague while she directed me further down. I said it was closed off and then they woke up and opened. I was the only passenger in that area then and went up front to wait for a counter to be ready. No counter was manned but 2 employees were present and of course they were also chatting. I timed it and it took 4 minutes before one looked up and called me forward. I had paid for an extra suitcase, arrived 2 hours before departure and later we were delayed on the ground an hour before take-off. Still none of my suitcases arrived in Catania. It is the 4th time I arrive in Catania from Rome with Alitalia without my luggage. I try to use alternatives like Vueling and Volotea - and it is a pure joy. The arrogance and lack of professionalism give me a bad feeling every time I have flown with them lately.

### "most uncomfortable flight"
London to Tokyo via Rome. Possibly the most uncomfortable long haul flight I have been on. The seats seem purposefully uncomfortable as they have a large head rest which pushes your head forward in the upright seat position. Also in every window seat there is a large box at your feet which cuts out 80% of your legroom. The seats themselves were hard and lumpy, although you did get a pillow and blanket which eased the pain slightly. The in-flight entertainment system looks like it hasn't been updated in around 20years but there were a few recent films at least. The cabin crew were mainly older, grumpy Italian men who seemed to hate their job. The food was ok by airline standards but I don't feel you really got enough to last the 12hr flight duration. The plane seemed quite old and it was very noisy throughout the flight. We chose Alitalia as it was the cheapest airline but in hindsight I should have paid the extra £200 to fly with a much better airline.

### "improved its quality"
Alghero to New York JFK via Rome Fiumicino in Economy class. I'm pleasantly surprised about the standard of the flight and Alitalia has improved its quality. The staff was excellent and the food was perfect. The flight was on time.

### "rude and not professional"
Boston to Bucharest via Rome. Extremely unhappy - all started in Boston where the ground crew decided to separate me from my husband without asking. The way I was spoken to at the counter in Boston was extremely rude and not professional. Before connecting in Rome, again the ground flight decided to move me even though I had the boarding pass issued in Boston and my seat was next to my husband. Nobody ever considered asking if I travel alone or not. Food was so bad could not eat anything. Seats extremely small. Flight attendants spoke only Italian in economy class.

### "the best option on this route"
We flew from Rome FCO to Toronto in Alitalia's A330s Business class. The flight was on time, and service was punctual, albeit unexciting, the food choice was good, and quality acceptable. Cabin arrangement is a definite improvement compared to other older Alitalia long distance airplanes. Seats are arranged to provide free aisle access and are 180 lie-flat, quite comfortable for a 9-hour flight. The only flaws are a quite cumbersome table hinge - you hit your knees frequently - and a protruding table clasp that is positioned so that it can rip your pants' pocket. An elegant amenity kit, slightly poor in its contents. Of the inflight entertainment, I only checked out the front camera view, showing takeoff and landing from the aircraft's nose. Overall a good value for money, probably the best option on this route.

### "snack and drink was offered"
It was not my first time with Alitalia, I usually use Alitalia, but it was the first time on an Embraer 175 and I was a bit worried cause it is just a little aircraft. My fear disappeared at once as soon as I got onboard, thanks to the welcoming staff. For a short flight (just 50 minutes) a snack and a drink was offered.

### "Alitalia did not disappoint"
I was nervous flying with Alitalia for the first time this summer due to all the negative reviews I had read. Our flight was Toronto to Barcelona via Rome, and return flight was Skopje to Toronto via Rome. Although customs/passport control in Rome was a tedious process, everything aboard Alitalia was great from the moment we sat down. The seats in economy were comfy (as comfy as you can get in economy class) and had a good amount of recline. There was space for someone taller to stretch their legs as well. The headrest was a bit awkward as I'm short, but didn't matter as I had a pillow. Inflight entertainment was solid - good options of newer movies and shows. Food was pretty good for an airline. I have always flown Delta so I was nervous how our meal/snacks would be on a 8+ hour flight but Alitalia did not disappoint. We also didn't lose any baggage (major complaint of this airline). Given the cheap price and convenience, I would definitely fly Alitalia again.

### "lack of customer service"
After our trip to Italy in July, we flew from Rome to Zurich. My daughter's luggage arrived in Zurich. Mine did not. No one knew where it was for 4 days and was finally found in Malaga, Spain. Not having my luggage ruined the last week of my trip. I had only the clothes I was wearing the day we left Rome for another whole week. I arrived back in the US and it was another whole week before I finally got my things back. It took forever to get them to reply to my claim for reimbursement of the basic items I had to buy since everything was lost. When they finally "agreed" to reimburse me, they said they had 30 days to get the reimbursement to me. Now it's been 34 days and I haven't seen a penny. They have the nerve to say they appreciate my business and want to keep my loyalty as a customer. I am just appalled at their lack of customer service.

### "exceeded my expectations "
Alitalia exceeded my expectations for my flight to Miami from Rome. The flight attendants were professional, on time to refill glasses with beverages and offer any additional help. We had a mess-up with the seats during the check-in, and would have ended up seating separately, however the flight attendants managed to rearrange the seats and put us together. It is worth noting that almost every couple in business class had a mess-up with the seats, therefore, kudos to the crew for their effort to rearrange the seating. We were presented with a Bvlgari flight kit. The business class cabin  is very stylish, seats recline to a flat bed, and extremely comfortable. A330-200 only 6 years old and the cabin felt fresh and not beaten up. Bathrooms were nice. TV Screens are big and the menu easy to navigate. The food and beverage service was impressive. We were served amazing restaurant quality fish and beef with wonderful tomato pasta with basil, accompanied by Italian wines and other spirits. Also an assortment of Italian cheeses and desserts, cappuccino and chocolates. The rest of the flight we managed to get 4-5 hours of sleep. We were served snacks prior to our descent to Miami. During the snack my wife's entertainment system froze. The flight attendant tried to revive it, but the screen would not turn back on. About 40 minutes later, the same flight attendant approached us with deep apologies and gave a voucher for 150 euros credit towards the purchase of a future ticket with Alitalia.

### "I will not recommend Alitalia"
I booked Milan to Bangkok with Ethiad and I noted later that Milan to Abu Dhabi was operated by Alitalia. Milan to Abu Dhabi was a night flight: we took off with 4 hours delay for a problem with toilets. We received update from airport screen and from the captain at the gate. Seats were very uncomfortable. Return flight was in the morning. A good breakfast has been served after 1 hour but with no choice. Meal was a very poor and small breakfast. Service was very poor: after 4 hours flight only a glass of water has been served. I went 3 times on the back for ask for a glass of water. Last time I went I took a whole 1,5 liter bottle of water for me and my family travelling with me. I will not recommend Alitalia for long flight.

### "refused to send the baggage direct"
I traveled with Alitalia from Brindisi to Rome, Rome to Marseilles. First of all they refused to send the baggage direct to Marseilles, I informed them that I am traveling with my baby 3 month alone and it is hard to take the baggage, but they refused as they told me that the tickets reserved separately. I reach Rome and the baggage didn't arrive (lost) and the lost and found were very carless and not helpful. In the end, I lost my second flight to Marseilles because of their mistake and they asked me for money for new reservation.

### "never want to take Alitalia again"
Connected from a MEA codeshare Beirut to Rome, then Alitalia from Rome to Toronto. Avoid any connection through Rome. There is too much reliance on buses to reach aircraft and the terminals are not thoughtfully arranged. Acoustics are terrible, with the result that most announcements cannot be understood. There was a 90 minute delay in boarding with no explanation given. Then the bus. PE seating on the A330 is good, but that is the only positive comment I can make. The food was very very awful. Really, a calzone and a muffin? Then there was an hour waiting for bags to come up. I have heard too much that is bad about this airline and now I know why. I would certainly avoid connecting in Rome and would never want to take Alitalia again.

### "would fly Alitalia again"
I flew Alitalia from JFK to Montenegro via Rome in June and returned on September 5. All flights went smoothly even the connections in Rome, and were on time. Alitalia honored the seats I selected during booking and luggage arrived with no problems. The new cabin was impressive, in flight entertainment was just ok. The only complaints I had was the leg room, compared to other international carriers Alitalia had very little leg room. Also, I did not enjoy any of the meals. I was full with just one bite. Besides the leg room, and meal complaints everything else went smoothly, and would fly Alitalia again on my next trip to Europe.

### "very efficient, fast and discreet"
Really happy about the new Alitalia experience flying from Milano to Ibiza. Excellent ground service in the completely renovated Linate lounge. Inflight service was also very efficient, fast and discreet. Excellent inflight food. Good selection of magazines on board and nice looking cabin with the new leather seat. Worth the money.

### "ground and cabin crew has been friendly"
Dusseldorf to Rome. At the gate, because of SkyTeam rewards (Delta SkyMiles), I was upgraded to business class. The ground and cabin crew has been friendly, they served a seriously good and abundant meal. Alitalia has renewed the business part of some planes: the dividing walls are now covered by a laminate light wood with the logo of Alitalia and it just looks gorgeous.

### "onboard experience improved"
Pisa Airport is rather small, and the check-in process had yet to begin so we waited at a cafe on the opposite side of the terminal. Once check-in opened we were fifth in line and were at the counter in 10 minutes. The personnel was fast and efficient and printed our boarding passes for both legs. Our flight was set to board at 7.00pm and depart at 7.15, but we didn't board until 7.45. The flight to Rome was operated by an Etihad Regional, and the flight attendants were kind. A drink and authentic Italian cookies were served. We quickly deplaned and sped through the arrivals hall. Our luggage was checked-in and would be kept at the airport overnight and sent to our next leg, or so we thought. The next morning  our flight left at 9.30, we went straight to security, that took us about two minutes, the terminal was practically empty. At 8.30 boarding began and we entered our A330-200, the cabin was very nice, seats wide and comfortable. There was wifi, which I didn't get, and the IFE was perfect for a 10-hour flight. During the flight they came with drinks after takeoff and some more of the cookies. An hour or two later they served lunch, which was a great meal, not in quantity but the taste made up for it. Before landing another light meal was served, it was like a pizza. Overall the quality of the onboard experience has improved with Alitalia. We arrived 20 minutes early and had a very quick experience at customs. When we went to pick up our bags, one of the two checked in didn't arrive. We proceeded to the Alitalia desk, to find a line of about 20 people who's bags also didn't arrive. They gave us a list of phone numbers, which never worked except for the Italian one, and after half hour of talking with a rather slow customer service agent over the phone, it turns out our luggage had been sent to Istanbul. After a week our bag arrived home. Overall a pleasurable experience except for the mishap at the end.

### "perfectly pleasant flights"
Overall, perfectly pleasant flights from Toronto to Rome return with Alitalia. The planes were new with a stylish and attractive layout. The seats were comfortable with good leg room. Blankets were provided, which were needed as the cabin got very cold. The crew were pleasant enough and efficient, although I would have appreciated more communication from the pilots. On the return flight we were sitting for an hour on the plane at the gate and they had to restart the power two or three times, yet there was no explanation from the pilot beyond the aircraft needing a quick "technical repair". The IFE was pretty good although the selection not quite as extensive as on BA or Air Canada. The food was fairly mediocre even by airplane standards, and I expected better from the flagship Italian carrier: a choice of burnt pasta or oily chicken on both flights. All in all, I enjoyed the flights and would choose Alitalia again.

### "I would not recommend Alitalia"
I would not recommend Alitalia. Rome to New York JFK, there was no business class check in line at Rome,  only a Sky Priority line which was long and very chaotic. No one from the airline did anything to control the line. People were cutting in line and others were fighting with them about it. It took us over an hour to check in. When we got to the Agent, they said they were oversold and had to make many calls just to get us our boarding passes. We lost the seat assignments that we had made a month before. Evidently this happens often (that's what they said) and according to some other people we talked to, they sometimes deny boarding to people even in business class because they don't have the seats. The plane took a long time to board. They use buses from the terminal. The plane left 2 hours late without good communication about why. The service onboard was not very good at all. The flight attendants go running around and seem to be busy, but they really don't do much and hardly ever smile. From the start they gave my partner a glass of water rather than the wine he ordered. He hit his call button and they did not respond. They gave me the wrong main course. My partner order a coffee later with the second meal and they never brought it to him. There was a 2-3 year old girl running up and down the aisle for most of the flight, so it was impossible to take a nap. The flight attendants did nothing to stop it even though it interfered with their ability to provide service. Food was just okay. The bread was hard as a rock. Flight attendants did the first lunch meal service and then never checked back with us until last meal service on an 8-9 hour flight. Last meal before landing was a couple pieces of bread, cheese and meat. The seats were pretty good and go flat, but service and overall experience (especially check in) was very disappointing.

### "not interested in serving customers"
New York JFK to Rome. Went on a family holiday to the US for 3 weeks and Alitalia prices were the lowest at moment of booking, however the service and food served onboard were also the lowest. The crew was not really welcoming, hardly smiling, seemingly not interested in serving their customers, and it felt as if we as passengers were a burden to them. Food was not what I expected from an italian carrier, choice between pasta or chicken, mediocre taste and presentation, bun like chewing gum and dessert chemical looking. On 8 hour flight only 2 services, the dinner served about an hour after take off and the breakfast an hour before landing, breakfast consisting of 1 sweet bun only - nothing else , very disappointing. The price was right, but service and food not.

### "denigrating and discriminatory"
I booked an Alitalia flight from Malaga to Rome to travel the 29th of July (flight AZ91), that day I went to the check in desk where I showed my passport (I am a Mexican citizen), the person in charge asked me for a tourist or residence visa to travel to Italy, I reply that I don't need visa, then she called her supervisor, she said they can't let me on board unless I show I have enough money or a printed ticket to show when do I leave. I had traveled to Italy 2 other times within the last month (flights SQ366 and BA2540) and they never asked for such information so I know for certain this is not a standard practice for a check-in desk. All tourist that travel to countries where they don't need visa, have some restrictions for the length of stay, but they only asked me for further probes, and this was done in a very denigrating and discriminatory way. At the end they gave me my boarding pass, only because someone I was traveling with had printed some reservations, but otherwise I would have been denied the right to board. I read the terms of my Alitalia ticket purchase and it is only written I should show my passport or visa if necessary, nowhere is written I should have printed my traveling plans. So there is no justification for the treatment I received.

### "simply outstanding"
Rome to Sao Paulo with Alitalia. Simply outstanding. I typically fly BA / American but decided to try something new. I hit the jackpot with Alitalia. The staff seem to be very proud to work for the company, everyone very friendly, appeared to be happy. The lounges at FCO are good, I particularly liked the "Casa Alitalia" lounge by the G Gates, although very full it had an excellent variety of really nice food and drink. On board the staff were fantastic, the seat / bed very comfortable, the food / drink outstanding. The staff that served me had the style of a waiter in a very good Italian restaurant, really knew the menu, was able to recommend excellent combinations of food / wine. The aircraft left and arrived on time. The aircraft was in great condition, looked like it had recently been refitted, it was very clean. This was my first flight with Alitalia it will not be my last.

### "excellent friendly staff"
Two eventless but satisfactory flights with Alitalia from Heathrow to Rome via Milan. Both aircraft were in good shape, the staff very well presented. At Heathrow T4 check in was swift, the Etihad lounge is ok, had a nice breakfast. I liked the lounge at Linate, very nice coffee, small but not that busy and excellent friendly staff. It seems to be fundamental to Alitalia's strategy that their staff be enthusiastic, they seem to enjoy their work. Everyone was helpful. Seats on the flights were Recaro seats, in good condition, comfortable. My expectations of short haul flights are not high but Alitalia did very well. Recommended.

### "didn't see any of them smiling"
Milan to New York JFK. I was rebooked on Alitalia as my Delta flight was delayed and I would have missed my connection. The check in process was fine, my wife and I were able to check in without any major problem. The agents were friendly. But the plane was dirty and the food was mediocre at best. The worst problem was that flight attendants were rude. I didn't see any of them smiling or greeting anyone. At least the staff assigned to our rows were acting as if they were doing us a favor to let us on their plane. I don't think that I would ever get on Alitalia again.

### "not happy with the check in"
Brussels to Rome. Planes were clean and personel was friendly. There weren't any delays and Alitalia is one of the only airlines that still give free drinks and food on board. However, I am not happy with the check in. I have bought these tickets in february, and reserved my seats as we are traveling with small childeren. On the return flight to Brussels, Alitalia suddenly changed the seat of a child to 23E while we were sitting at 11,12 and 14. Since one person did not travel (but we have paid for the seat and he was checked in). I asked in Rome to cancel this seat and move the child from 23E to this seat. They put us on standby and sent us to the standby desk, where we heard the flight was overbooked! We almost missed our flight. According to a lady of Alitalia, this was not the right procedure and they came with us to the standby office to solve the problem (by skipping the queue). I don't understand the point of the seat reservation when you book your flight, when you are not 100% sure Alitalia respects it. The training of the Alitalia check in staff must also be improved (certainly language skills).

### "service has definitely improved"
Rome Fiumicino - Barcelona and return. First leg with A321 and the second with A320. I can say that the service has definitely improved compared to some years ago. We were served a brioche on the flight to Barcelona and a sandwich on the way back to Rome, something better than the small pocket of biscuits they now seem to provide only onboard the national flights. Drink service was fine. Cabin crew was polite and always smiling. I will fly Alitalia again.

### "cabin crew were attentive and professional"
Rome FCO to Reggio Calabria and return. I have to say I really like the image of the new Alitalia, from the red and green uniforms to the new aircraft interiors, I was eager to verify all the changes done with Etihad. The change of style is visible everywhere inside Fiumicino airport and it gives you an idea of the improvement Alitalia is doing. The cabin crew were attentive and professional, food service has not changed that much, at least on regional flights, but it's fine for a 1 hour flight. On both flights we arrived ahead of scheduled time. I have nothing to complain about and I'll fly Alitalia again.

### "Alitalia always a mixed bag"
Los Angeles to Rome with Alitalia. As with always, AZ is a mixed bag (based on several flights in past year, including transatlantic (FCO/LAX, ORD, JFK), inter-European and domestic (ex. BLQ, FCO, CTA). One thing to remember is that Alitalia are never on time. It's actually somewhat comical, and usually only 15-30 minutes, but if you're connecting make sure to pad the schedule taking this into account. That said, my partner recently spent 18+ hours waiting on an LAX-FCO, due to a cascading series of issues and lack of slack in their operations. The good of Alitalia - much more service and flair (there are a few poor cabin crew always, but many more good ones, and they are far more polished / professional than BA, AA, DL, etc. Only AF and LH are close in my experience). They seem especially helpful with older travelers and children. Decent food in eco and long-haul eco-premium. Nothing to remember, but better than usual airline stuff. Eco premium is a really good deal - only about 400-500Eur more and well worth it on long flights. Good legroom, entertainment, small/quiet cabin. The bad - their operational staff is a disaster. Literally, they are never on time, and they can't seem to iron this out. Skyteam coordination is nearly absent. You get your boarding pass from one, but still need to reprint on another (had this experience for DL, AF - maybe better with Etihad) - Rome Fiumicino is getting better, but is still a chaotic compared to CDG, AMS, or even FRA.

### "a mixed bag with Alitalia"
A mixed bag with Alitalia. Catania to Rome on a refurbished A320. Punctual, drinks (including beer and wine) and sandwich provided free of charge. Younger flight assistants nice and friendly. Older ones grumpy and unfriendly. Rome to Madrid 30 minutes delay. No explanation from crew. Emergency exit with plenty of space. One flight assistant should seriously consider changing his job had a look of constant hatred on his face. The rest of the crew were ok but just about. Same drink service and sandwich as in the previous flight.

### "excellent inflight service"
I'm a loyal customer of Alitalia, I take almost 30 flights per year. This year I have seen the airline improve a lot. Alghero to Bilbao via Rome. Excellent inflight service with a totally renovated cabin, very comfortable seats. Breakfast and lunch (with red wine) were free and the quality was excellent. I just hope they will improve WiFi onboard.

### "do not care about service"
If you want to just arrive to your destination and do not care about service, Alitalia might be for your. Otherwise, do not use them. Flew from Toronto to Istanbul via Rome. The food was low quality even though part of it was long haul flight. I flew using Etihad, British Airways, KLM, Air Canada and Lufthansa. They are all light years ahead of Alitalia. I had to cancel my children's ticket and it took them weeks to process, while it took BA couple of days. We had to wait for 9 hours in Rome Airport to catch another flight. The airport does not even have AC, although it does have free wifi. In short, do not use Alitalia unless you really have no other choice.

### "breakfast was delicious and plentiful"
Milan to Valencia via Rome with Alitalia. Service for business customers is attentive and with Sky Priority all procedures are faster. The seat in business class was very comfortable and the seats are configured so that the one in the middle row is free. The onboard staff has been very kind and caring for the whole trip. Breakfast served on board was delicious and plentiful.

### "excellent inflight service"
Milan to Buenos Aires via Rome with Alitalia. Excellent inflight service with meticulous attention to detail. Products offered together with some of the biggest names in Italy. Very good menu with a wide range of Italian wine. Seats very comfortable with "Poltrona Frau" leather and flatbed position and massage function. The crew, in addition to the slippers, also provided an elegant amenity kit by Salvatore Ferragamo. The only thing that can be improved is the entertainment system with the inclusion of WiFi onboard. I could not try the lounge in G terminal in Rome because it was closed for renovation. However, the Milan Linate lounge is comfortable

### "staff were friendly"
I recently flew Alitalia from Amsterdam to Milan Linate and back. Both flights were operated by their refurbished A320. Both flights on time, staff were friendly, snacks and drinks served. All in all, a perfect flight, considering how short a hop (1h 20min) it is. The only downside is Milan Linate airport, where everything is very unorganized, esp. check in. Alitalia should focus on this more.

### "never again with Alitalia"
My friend who lives in Naples booked 2 Alitalia tickets in January this year to fly Naples to Sicily. She booked the light option and booked 2 suitcases with the tickets. When we came to check in at the desk last Tuesday, the clerk informed us that we had to pay 38 euros each for our suitcases each way. We were extremely annoyed and my friend pointed out to the lady behind the desk that we had already paid for the luggage. But unbeknown to us in April they had changed their policies. So unless we paid, we couldn't take our luggage on board. We had to pay, and it was a bad start to our holiday. So when we got settled on holiday, we decided to check our luggage online for the way back, what a joke. It is impossible to access the website to check luggage in. Never again would I book with Alitalia, they are rip off merchants.

### "new uniforms elegant and professional"
Rome to New York JFK with Alitalia. Did not know what to expect. Wanted more leg room for the 8 plus hour flight so went for Premium Economy. Liked the little free case of toiletries. Given wine, a pretty good meal, but before that corn chips and a drink. The second meal was not so great. Had good selection of movies but it was hard to get the screen up and the flight attendant had to help me. They just got new uniforms, very elegant and professional looking. The ground crew was helpful as the kiosk did not work. At the ticket desk the staff put my checked in bag up on the place where it was weighed. Never had that before. She was very friendly. She was proud of the new look of her uniform. Seem to like her job. I liked the screen in front of the seats where it told what altitude we were flying, kilometers and miles we flew and time still to go. My baggage was free. Bathrooms bigger than normal. Lots of space for my handheld bag. A very smooth ride.

### "food was practically inedible"
Flew Alitalia from Madrid to Tokyo via Rome. In the last couple of years I've done a lot of long haul flying but this was undoubtedly the worst experience of all. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable with very little leg room. I'm not tall but I finished the flight with back pain. The food was practically inedible. I showed my overheated pasta dish to the air hostess: the pasta was stuck to the lid and the sauce was completely dried up. She kindly tried to remedy the situation by bringing another dish which was swimming in oil. The entertainment system was antediluvian. The same air hostess had to do a reset to try to get it to work which it did intermittently. The air hostess was the best thing about the flight. She did her best and tried to be helpful unlike her male colleagues who seemed to wish they were someone else. I only got this flight because a friend had booked it. In fact, she ended flying up with another airline.

### "the meal was delicious"
The reason I chose Alitalia on this journey from London Heathrow to Rome Fiumicino against BA is the extra legroom they offer in business class and the assumption of better meals of the Italians. The BA legroom is exactly the same as economy class seats', the only difference is the unoccupied and "trayed" middle seat shame. The staff were friendly and service was smooth, but the drinks list was short. Prosecco ran out after one small bottle (I mean one bottle for all passengers in business class), gin tonic was simply unavailable. They only had grappa and limoncello as a shot on board. But to be frank, the meal was delicious. The "Priority" tagged luggage arrived much sooner in Rome than the economy luggage indeed. Not sure I would use Alitalia again if there was another option.

### "crew were welcoming and smart"
Had six flights with Alitalia in May: Milano to Rome and Milano to Tehran via FCO one week later. My feeling is that somehow the service is better, in terms of attitude and quality, on the 50 min hop than the 4hr 30min medium haul leg. Crew on the domestic leg were welcoming and smart, I cannot say the same about the Italy to Iran part since some of them were quite grumpy and generally speaking they did not seem to enjoy their job. During the first trip, "dinner" was a joke: a cold snack of questionable quality and that's it. On the way back, breakfast was served right after takeoff (so around 4am). No entertainment system of any kind, not even a map and IKA-FCO no communication at all from the cockpit, not even welcome onboard. Strange boarding procedure eer in FCO: after a long walk to a remote terminal we were bussed back to the Schengen terminal and dropped in front of the plane, then we had to walk upstairs in the finger to board from there, never happened before and I do travel a lot. The same happened on the way back from Iran. Price of the ticket was very similar to Emirates and twice as much my other option (Turkish Airlines): in the end I chose AZ because of the good connecting time from/to LIN and total trip duration and, being Italian, I will give them more chances in the future since they are renewing their fleet and improving their network but after this experience I must say I am not impressed at all.

### "seats were mildly uncomfortable"
Flew Alitalia from NYC, JFK to Rome, Fiumicino. Boarding was smoother than anticipated. Crew and flight attendants were kind and welcoming enough. The seats were mildly uncomfortable but the pillow provided made it a bit easier to bear. The selection of movies was very good, with many recent and popular releases. Food was average - a choice of pasta or meat, as was our snack before landing. Offered wine as a drink which I liked. Upon landing, it did take quite some time to get off the plane, shuttle to our correct terminal, and pick up our bags. Overall, for the generally lower price of the ticket, I am pleased with the flight and would use it again.

### "2 out of 4 flights delayed"
During the past week, 2 out of 4 Alitalia flights (London to Rome, and Bucharest to Rome) were delayed by more than 1 hour. Because of this, we missed one connection flight, and we had to stay overnight in Rome. 1 out of 2 pieces of luggage was lost, despite asking in the FCO airport Alitalia representative about it, and being assured that it is loaded. Tried calling London Heathrow office, no answer, website tracking is useless.

### "flight very comfortable"
Rome to Budapest return with Alitalia. Flight very comfortable, despite my 185cm in height I had a lot of legroom. We were served a drink and a sandwich, with a choice between meat and vegetarian. Clean plane and new thanks to the restyling of the company.

### "website didn't work"
Bologna to Rome. I am forced to use Alitalia on domestic flights. I wanted to add two suitcases online before flying - the website didn't work! The android app didn't work. I phoned their service number and after 10 minutes was asked to call another number. The service number charged me 10 euro for nothing. The alternative number answered in the rudest way to call the service number instead. I called back as I now wanted this to work - and having said how bad everything was for me a patient person took care of me and took my credit card details to pay for the two suitcases - the first I was told cost €30 and the second €55 - I said I called because I wanted the internet discount of €20/€44. She had to check and came after a long time back. I now did this to check their incredibly bad performance knowing very well it would be cheaper to pay the full price instead of the expensive telephone. She came back and said they would give me the lower tarif and she took my card details and she said it was OK. I checked afterwards if it was registred on my booking, but the website then told me my booking wasn't found! I gave up to phone back and wasn't sure what to expect at the airport the next day. They did find my booking, but not any mentioning of included luggage. I had to go and pay the full tarif having spent a lot of time and money (almost €30) on phone calls in addition. I have flown domestic in Italy with Vueling twice since then.

### "I was quite disappointed"
Los Angeles to Rome with Alitalia. I must say I was quite disappointed. First my flight was booked with Delta and given to Alitalia. The seats are small and the entertainment system complicated to use. The food was just okay and no ice on the flight. I had a window seat since I don't get up much and to my surprise this over sized box is attached to seat whch does not allow you to have leg room - this was very uncomfortable. Thank goodness the seat next to me was vacant. I am dreading my return flight home, because I have a window seat again and don't know if I will get so lucky again. The staff were so so, not always as pleasant as they could have been.

### "clearly back on track"
Brussels to Brindisi via Rome with Alitalia. Clearly the investment from Etihad is working as they have upgraded their product. The cabin received a nice new look. Also a sandwhich is now provided on international flights for free next to soft drinks and wine. Salt or sweet snacks with soft drinks are available for free on domestic flights. Clean modern aircraft both ways. Most of the flights departed with a delay but landed on time except for the Brussels to Rome flight, resulting in not having our check-in luggage at Brindisi. Alitalia is clearly back on track.

### "I did not expect much"
I chose to fly with Alitalia to Tokyo as they were the cheapest carrier at the time, and being a student it has to be the cheapest! Due to delay issues, we did not fly out with Alitalia, but flew them on the return from Tokyo to London via Rome. The flight from Tokyo was alright, nothing more nothing less. I did not expect much paying a cheap fare and I would not say it was drastically worse than other economy class on average. Legroom was fairly poor, the entertainment system was a bit outdated and the food was okay except they ran out of choice by the time they reached me. However what do you expect when you pay just over £400 return. So 8/10 for the price paid. Ground service on the way out was awful. We checked in and reached the gate for our outbound flight to Rome. After a delay of an hour we are told that the flight was cancelled. By this stage I knew getting to Tokyo would be awkward as we would miss our connection. Normally an airline will re-route you the quickest route to your destination and often with a partner airline. This did not happen whatsoever. There was a 2 hour wait to get re-routed and once at the front we were told we would be re-routed the following day - no compensation, no food voucher and a hotel night was all that was offered. The staff were rude and did not seem to know what they were doing. I believed they were stressed and waited for everybody to be re-routed then came back to challenge them for a better re-route. After an hour of telling the staff about what Skyteam was and their partnership with other airlines they finally started to look for an earlier flight. However again the staff were clueless and did not know about other routes, it was I looking up flight numbers and partner airlines myself and showing them on my phone that finally got us re-routed on Korean Air via Seoul. Leaving us with an 8 hour delay rather than 24 hours. So Alitalia are worth the price if you know what you are doing when you travel. If you're an anxious traveller or new to flying I would not recommend them purely on the basis that if something goes wrong it would not be a pleasurable experience. Just make sure that if you are ever delayed ensure that you get food vouchers and know of any possible re-routes and ask for one kindly once everybody else has already been re-routed, otherwise their stress = shouting at you and not wanting to help.

### "very pleasant surprise"
Having read reviews of Alitalia, I was a little worried about our flight from Venice to Abu Dhabi. It was a very pleasant surprise. Check-in at VCE could not have been easier or quicker, and the boarding went very smoothly as well. The A330 seats were very comfortable, with good legroom (and I am 6'4"). Cabin crew friendly and helpful. The lunch was very good, with a good selection of wines to accompany. IFE had a wide selection, and was easy to navigate. Arrived early into Abu Dhabi. I would not hesitate to fly Alitalia again, and their A330s are a very comfortable way to fly.

### "Boeing 777 seats really small"
New York to Rome with Alitalia. Ground service is good, polite and helpful staff. The lounge is clean and comfortable. Boeing 777 economy seats are really small and uncomfortable, window seats have some kind of a box under the seat that takes most of the space for your feet. Headrests force you to keep your head in a very uncomfortable position. Seats can barely be reclined. Inflight entertainment not an interesting choice of movies. They don't change movies too often. If you fly within one or two months you still find the same movies. Meals are average. They used to have snacks available in the galley during the flight, but not anymore. Flights are mostly on time. I love the late schedule out of JFK to Rome.

### "thanks to Alitalia"
Due to the ENAV the Air Traffic Control  strike our flight from Rome to Palermo April 9th at 10:00 am was canceled and re-booking was set at about 19:30 Saturday night, which was too late for us. I was head of a group of 41 people away to Palermo for an important dance contest. Alitalia later contacted us giving us great news, and they increased the capacity of the flight to Palermo at 14:55, and included our group fell in that departure. Fortunately, with the help of Alitalia we reached Palermo in time for our race and we returned victorious. So thanks to Alitalia.

### "seats narrow and uncomfortable"
Miami to Rome with Alitalia. The seats are narrow and uncomfortable, good thing we requested a seat with leg room so we sat at the emergency exit. If you are 5'9"or taller don't book economy because you will have an uncomfortable flight. The food was ok and edible. The steward and stewardess were very nice.

### "family allocated different seats"
Athens to Rome with Alitalia. We had the bright idea to do a web check in, but the family was allocated different seats. Called Alitalia in Athens to ask if this could be changed as a family with a 3 year old must be seated together, and told that this was a computer allocation and that they would help us at the airport. At the counter we were told they could not help us but as the flight was far from being full they would help us at the gate. And of course at the gate they referred us to the cabing crew who in turn told us that they could not help us and that we should have asked for assistance at the counter! The snack was a mini sandwich with dried meat. On our way back at Fiumicino they could not check the toddler's push trolley like in every other airport and sent us to the airport door with the trolley as there was no other way to check it in. At least they printed a badge to stick on the trolley. (The trolley was promptly delivered at the belt of Athens airport.) At the family check in point at Fiumiccino we had to wait for at least 15 minutes behind a single guest arguing about the price she had to pay for her suitcase. What kind of family check in counter this was only Alitalia knows.

### "the legroom was good"
Flew Alitalia from Amsterdam to Rome Fiumicino and back on a newly refurbished spotless A320 on both sectors. Boarding efficient and orderly, including fair enforcement of priority boarding. I appreciate that Alitalia has not watered down what few benefits SkyTeam silver elites enjoy while KLM and Air France move in the opposite direction. On board, new interiors are a bit retro in style but tasteful. Recaro slimline seats do become uncomfortable, though the legroom was good (I'm 5'11/180cm). Outbound a few minutes early, return a few minutes late due to thunderstorms in Rome, both crews made a point to tactfully speed boarding along to close door on time. Improvements in on-board service the last few months is obvious, flight attendants are more welcoming, friendly and efficient, though a few struggle with English (I asked for red wine three times before being handed white wine). Sandwich to Rome very tasty (multi-layer roasted red pepper, prosciutto, eggplant) but disappointing on return (ham + mild flavourless cheese on a white bun). New magazine design is sharp, but no other entertainment. Overall, I admit I went in with high expectations given the hype of the recent changes, and aside from the inconsistent catering, was pleased enough.

### "Breakfast was tasty"
Paris CDG to Rome on a refitted A320. Purser welcomed me and welcome drink served. Breakfast was tasty, fresh fruits and really very good. Arrived in FCO, and did the transfer by bus quickly, and once we arrived again on board for the FCO-PMO flight we noticed that the purser was the same. Great flight also from FCO to PMO with crew smiling.

### "good food and beverage"
Cagliari to Abu Dhabi via Rome with new business class product. Smooth check in formalities in CAG airport and flights on time. Onboard FCO-AUH flight, the purser greeted me and my family and explained details of the dine anytime service. Good food and beverage, full flat bed, professional flight attendants.

### "will never fly Alitalia again"
Prior to this Los Angeles to Rome flight, I hadn't flown Alitalia in years. Only they and their partners (Delta, KLM) fly non-stop LA to Rome, so when I saw that Alitalia was offering the a lower fare than most stop-over flights, I snatched up the ticket. I thought I was getting a great deal because the same flight had always been so much more expensive. You really do get what you pay for. The plane was old and quite dirty - there was a used band-aid on the seat next to mine - on top of the package with the blanket, pillow, headphones! I refused to use the blanket or pillow because those too seemed dingy. The seats were cramped (I'm not very tall), hard and uncomfortable; I think a lawn chair would have been more comfortable. That is simply unacceptable on a long-haul flight. The flight attendants were curt, borderline rude, and seemed constantly irritated to even be on the plane. The food was mediocre, both inbound and outbound. Typically, I typically get pretty decent meals on return flights from Italy, as the food comes from Italy or Europe, but somehow they messed it up. Surprisingly, they didn't lose my luggage, although the flight was non-stop, so there was a little less room for error there. I'm embarrassed that this is Italy's national airline. I will never fly Alitalia again.

### "beware of this airline"
I have been trying to purchase a ticket from Malta to Rome on their new "revamped website" today 21st February 2016. After trying 4 times where during the process the website prompted several errors and had to re start again I finally managed to pay. I used Google Chrome as a browser. I paid for 2 passengers thats is for my wife and myself whereas my wife kept her surname, so we both have different surnames. The ticket came out both with my wife's surname and I was 100% sure I didn't do the mistake because the layout of entering passenger details is in such a way where you cannot mix them up. That means that unless my ticket has my correct name as on passport it is void. I called the international support services who answered in Italian so I had to speak in Italian. Thank god I spoke Italian fluently. After leaving me on a overseas call waiting for 10 mins she replied that I had to cancel my ticket and do another one. That is throwing away Euro 200. I could only get a refund of the taxes. Euro 50 approx. The error on the ticket could have been the result of two probabilities. Either I am stupid enough to write my wife's surname on my ticket or there was software error. I have gone through the buying process to see if it is possible I could have mixed up the names but there is no way these could have been mixed since there is a clear difference when entering each passenger. I am quite certain that given that the site progressed in 4 errors and had to restart again something is wrong with the software. I asked the international support to prove that I made a mistake but she said its impossible and hung up swiftly. Beware of this airline.

### "you get what you pay for"
I have flown with Alitalia a few times, and they seem to disappoint me on each trip. On this trip I flew from Milan–Malpensa to Abu Dhabi. The premium economy seats are worse than the economy seats, I personally found the economy seats more comfortable. Inflight entertainment was not bad, not up to the standard of Emirates, but it kept me entertained. Food was not great. Overall you get what you pay for, a cheap plane ticket to your destination. Will fly them again but in economy.

### "a budget airline these days"
Alitalia were cheaper than other airlines flying CAI-LHR by about 150USD. The flights from Cairo to London Heathrow via Rome were mostly on time. Some members of my travelling party had luggage overweight by 2-3kg when returning from LHR and the check-in agent was very critical rather than helping them know what they should do. Alitalia is really a budget airline these days - simple food, no inflight entertainment on flights under 4hrs. At Rome, both the LHR and Cairo flights had to take buses from the terminal rather than use sky bridges. Pretty surprising given it is their home airport. Their price was good but we got what we paid for.

### "planes old and dirty"
Brussels to Tel Aviv via Rome with Alitalia - it took 3 transfer buses in Fiumicino airport to get on to the flight to Tel Aviv. The flight to Tel Aviv was a nightmare - planes are old and dirty, toilet cleanliness very poor. Service on the plane was poor - no water for 1.5 hours and the 2 staff were continuously complaining against customers. It's a shame to be Italian and see the airline managed like this. Flight back from Istanbul was almost 1 hour late and they booked me on another flight - aircraft again dirty and old. The price of the flight was high and I would only use Alitalia for very short range, local flights.

### "cabin crew professional"
Rome to Milan Linate and return with Alitalia. Flights operated with aged A319 but well maintained, cabin crew professional and food consisted in a little pack of biscuits or chips, ok for such a short route. I'll not hesitate to fly Alitalia on regional and medium haul flights again.

### "very professional service"
Rome to Miami in Alitalia business class on A330. Outstanding food and very professional service by the crew made for a relaxing flight. New leather seats on business class. Great selection of movies on the inflight entertainment, highly recommended.

### "was worth the price"
I booked 2 tickets from New York JFK to Rome return for two trips in 2015, travelling in Alitalia's Premium economy product. They cordon off Premium economy seating area which is limited to 24 seats or less. Offerings include a free amenity kit which depending on the time of year can be from a famous Italian designer. Priority boarding and deplaning is offered, meals of a taste good are included. We were fed four times and offered free drinks. As someone who is disabled the Flight attendants insisted I use the business class bathrooms as they did not want me to walk very far. As a disabled person I felt that they went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Check in was a breeze, as you use the line for business class. I believe this product is perfect in price if you want to feel like your flying in premium but not spend a ton of cash for it. I would definitely say it was worth the $1800.00 round trip price  and believe it was money well spent and would do it again. Great marks on Alitalia's handling of a disabled passenger and their guest.

### "avoid Alitalia in the future"
Tel Aviv to Milan via Rome with Alitalia, and the flight was fine. They lost my luggage and it took them 5 days to deliver. Customer Service will answer but not necessarily know at any time where is your luggage is. Hope the way back will be smoother. I will try to avoid Alitalia in the future.

### "seat didn't recline"
This month travelled from Venice to Hong Kong with Etihad but the the segment from Venice to Abu Dhabi was unfortunately made by Alitalia. The flight departed 1.5 hours late because of routine checks (if they were routine checks I can't understand why they made them at the boarding time). The ground personnel told me multiple times that connecting flights were all confirmed. We arrived in Abu Dhabi 2 hours late and although we were only 20 minutes late to boarding time of the connecting flights, ground personnel didn't let us go to gate and forced us to miss our flight because they had already moved us to the flight the day after. On the return flight my seat didn't recline although the plane was new. Cabin staff service was rude as always, inflight entertainment poor and food bad (on return flight from Abu Dhabi to Venice they gave us a sandwich). Lastly, the flight is flown half with Alitalia and half with Etihad, however when you do the check-in on the Etihad website you can't choose seats for the Alitalia flight.

### "fight for a refund"
I booked and paid for Alitalia premium economy seats ($1200CA extra) from Toronto to Rome and return. Without warning, my premium seat on the way to Rome was not honoured because the aircraft that departed from Toronto was old and not equipped with such seats. I was seated in economy. I tried to explain the problem when I boarded the aircraft, but the cabin staff seemed indifferent and borderline rude! While in Italy, Alitalia agreed (via email) to refund the difference for the seat cost within one month. It's now been 3 months since their email and they haven't honoured their promise. I cannot reach their Cusomer Relations office directly. Alitalia doesn't allow it. One has to call the main reservations number; and maybe the attendant might convey one's message to Customer Relations. I have emailed Customer Relations several times. They don't respond. I have flown with countless airlines and have never heard of an airline who promises compensation (in writing) and then disappears. No customer should ever go through such effort and aggravation to receive a refund that was already promised. Do not book Premium Economy seats with Alitalia. If the aircraft changes and can't provide such seats, you either have to fight for a refund or will never get one.

### "service was great"
Alitalia trip from Palermo to New York JFK via Rome. The plane from Rome to JFK was somewhat worn looking on the interior, otherwise it was a great flight with friendly cabin crew and and a captain that was great at communicating foreseen turbulence (there wasn't any, but I always appreciate when a pilot is upfront about it). The service was great - snack, meal, and pre-landing snack. Inflight entertainment could use some work, but that's comparing it to Delta and Air France. I'd fly them again for Italy flights if needed.

### "seats are the original ones"
Madrid to Rome with Alitalia. Complimentary sandwiches, chips and biscuits apart from beverage, wine/beer. Warm Purser and FA in charge and a lady Captain. 5 flight attendants in total for 186 seats. A 25 minutes delay in take off (landed on time) and the A321 interior dated. No inflight entertainment or wi-fi. Lavatories need an update and the seats are the original ones with just a recent leather cover. Many of the problems of Alitalia resides in Rome FCO Airport structure and hub. Often times planes (especially EU flights) are parked quite remotely due to lack of bridges. The airport looks more like a bus terminal, with hundreds of vehicles/buses travelling in and out and only one runaway for take offs. Minimum (if you are lucky) luggage recollection time is 30 minutes after landing. Baggage belts are a mess, with the same belt serving 6 flight at the same time.

### "nice seats and very clean"
Paris to Cagliari via Rome. A new aircraft I believe with nice seats and very clean. Staff nice and smiling. Service has changed with a small sandwich and choice of drinks. Arrival at Rome and bus to the terminal, however faster than before. Gate for connecting flight to CAG reached in 5 minutes. Flight from Rome to Cagliari was pleasant, no snack only drinks.

### "unsatisfactory experience"
My flight Rome to New York JFK with Alitalia was an unsatisfactory experience. I upgraded to premium economy which provided me with an aisle bulkhead seat. The legroom was great, but I have never had such a narrow airline seat in my life. I am not a huge person, but the seat was uncomfortable, worn, and too narrow. The flight left about an hour late. The food (dinner and a snack) was inedible. The dinner claimed to be lasagne and the snack was a roll up with indeterminate ingredients as a filler. I ate neither of them, nor did anyone else I saw. They were not forthcoming with water or drinks in general, but did leave some out at the rear of the plane so one could help themselves. Upon arrival at JFK, when my husband and I tried to recheck our bags through to our home city, their companion airline (Delta) told us that the flight we had booked had been cancelled for over 2 months. We were never notified (they admitted this). Our new flight was to be 5 hours later than the first, however, Alitalia had neglected to check us into the flight when we checked in in Rome, so our seats had been given away. This necessitated a desperate taxi ride across the Van Wyck in Brooklyn trying to catch a flight at LaGuardia. Alitalia provided a taxi voucher - that was all. I have learned my lesson and will never fly with them again.

### "lower your inflight demands"
Athens to Brussels via Rome, and Alitalia service was adequate. We faced no delays, no baggage problem, some hand luggage problem was dealt professionally on board. Inflight meals were medium. But with the price of tickets you pay, you can't expect anything more. Generally, if you are ready to lower down your inflight demands, it's no problem to fly Alitalia, at least on short haul flights.

### "on time and pleasant"
Flew Alitalia from Rome-Buenos Aires and back. Check in was easy and fast and I had the chance to change flights for free, while with some companies you have to pay a fee. Both flights were on time and pleasant. Very good food and cabin staff always available. I was pleasantly surprised.

### "Plane and staff were fine"
I had to get a last minute flight from Rome to Cairo from Rome and my only option to fly direct was Alitalia. Plane and staff were fine. The food included only one option - cheese and veggie sandwich unless you'd indicated other while booking (i.e. seafood), no later than 2 hrs before the flight. Like a friend of mine later told me "You don't eat with Alitalia.

### "airplane dirty, old, terrible seats"
I was originally booked on Alitalia premium economy but was downgraded to economy because of a five hour strike, which delayed my trip by one day. Also, I had to pay 30 euros for the luggage since I was downgraded. The Alitalia staff were very unhelpful and didn't seem to care I was delayed one extra day and they made me feel if they were doing me a favor. Of course, no compensation, hotel, food, or anything. They did offer a partial refund with a seven week wait time. The airplane was dirty, old, with terrible seats. The inflight service was average and coffee stale.

### "crew were helpful"
Toronto to Rome, check-in went smoothly. Then staff told me that I would have to check my rolling carryon, because the flight was full and space would be limited for the overhead bins (and I had a backpack and a laptop sleeve so they wagered I would take up too much space; understandable). I was afraid that I would never see my bag, again, but I left it as instructed. It was one of the first bags on the carousel and I even got a smiley-faced greeting on the back of the tag that Alitalia had placed on the bag after checking it, through. We left half-an-hour earlier than planned, and the flight was smooth. The plane was clean, with pillow, headphones and blanket supplied. Being economy class, it was pretty cramped and uncomfortable with moving/reclining. We were given a meal during the first two hours of the flight (rather delicious) and a danish with coffee, juice etc towards the end of the flight. The crew were helpful and while they weren't as smiley as I am used to flight attendants being, they were not rude and inconsiderate, nor did they neglect passengers. My experience with this airline went against every single negative note I've read about them.

### "one of the worst flights"
Tel Aviv to Miami via Rome with Alitalia was one of the worst flights I've had on a major international carrier in a long time. I had checked in online. When arriving at the airport the line for people who had done this moved significantly slower than the one for people who hadn't. Checked luggage - they made me check a very small carry on bag with sensitive photography equipment against my will because it was slightly over their carry on bag weight limit. The case would have fit under my seat and contained very nice equipment which I wanted to safeguard. I explained this to no avail. This cost $100. Service on board - flight attendants were extremely rude. It felt like they were doing the passengers a favor by serving food and drinks. Seats are very uncomfortable at best. The meals are 0 Star,  the worst airline food I have ever had. Most people around me couldn't stomach the potato salad they served for lunch. I have been better treated and served on European low cost airlines than on this flight. I will not fly Alitalia again

### "arrived in Cairo on time"
Brussels to Cairo via Rome with Alitalia. Boarding at Brussels Airport was smooth. I had done check in online and I went straight to the baggage drop off counter. Flight to Rome departed on time, airplane was clean and staff nice. They served a sandwich and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Only drawback was the transfer to another gate at Rome Airport which was very painful and stressful. The flight to Cairo also departed on time. Staff was attentive and kind. They served a cold dinner, flight was smooth and arrived in Cairo on time.

### "friendly and efficient"
Roundtrip Rome to Buenos Aires with Alitalia. Cabin crew very friendly and efficient (on the return flight a lady felt unwell, the pilot asked if there was a doctor onboard and fortunately there was, and the crew managed the situation). In forward flight (night) they served snacks, hot dinner with two choices, breakfast. In return flight, hot lunch with two choices, dinner, snacks and breakfast. Plane was clean and seats comfortable. Personal entertainment at each seat. Both flights departed and landed on time, in return we arrived 30 minutes early.

### "competitive business class fare"
Madrid to Sofia via Rome with Alitalia was a mixed bag. MAD to SOF the usual indifferent service by Alitalia's surly flight assistants, and a delay of about 40 minutes. When asked whether I will be able to make the connection was told "you will, all of our flights are late today". Rome airport is a complete nightmare and that alone is a reason for not flying Alitalia again. On the way back however it was a different story. Flight assistants were very friendly and helpful and the food while nothing to write home about was much better. Flights departed on time and landed earlier than expected. I give it a rating of 6 because of the second helpings of pasta, the constant drink offerings and the competitive business class fares

### "still not refunded money"
Rome to Toronto. We paid for Premium Economy but Alitalia changed to a plane which did not include the Premium Economy option. They promised our travel agent to refund $134 per person after we traveled. Two months later they still have not refunded the money. Alitalia don't take calls about the matter and have not contacted us or agent, despite repeated emails and calls.

### "staff onboard was not friendly"
I have recently flown with Alitalia from Venice to Abu Dhabi with an Etihad ticket (the entire trip was VCE-BKK via AUH). But on this review I want to focus on the VCE-AUH route operated by Alitalia. The aircraft was a new A330, very nice and elegant cabin interior. The seat was confortable and aircraft was clean and tidy. In flight entertainment was good with a great selection of movies. What really disappointed me was the food and bevarage service and the crew. Staff onboard was not friendly. During boarding they were too busy to talk each other to have the chance to greet customers. Meal service began 1h 40 minutes after take off (on a 5h 50 minutes night flight!) Food was not good at all - I would say disgusting. The last service was a breakfast served 40 minutes before landing. Cabin crew rushed with their trolley through the cabin in order to finish the service on time prior to landing not giving the customers even the chance to realise that breakfast was being served. It goes without saying that between these two services cabin crew disappeared completely! Toilets after 5 hours flight were in a mess and very dirty.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
London to Tokyo via Rome with Alitalia, and I was pleasantly surprised. The cabin crew were friendly, and seen a lot during the flight. The seats weren't very comfortable (especially with the headrest pushing your head forward) and the planes were rather old, but the inflight entertainment worked fine and they had a wide selection of films to choose from. The food service was plentiful but not very nice (pasta was hard and chewy) and drinks were left at the back of the plane so passengers could help themselves during the flight. Just make sure you don't sit in a window seat or either of the middle seats in the middle block, as the entertainment systems are stored at your feet which severely impacts your legroom. We paid £400 for return flights from London to Tokyo, which was remarkable value for money and if it meant paying so little, I would travel with Alitalia again.

### "not competitive"
Alitalia has antiquated rules on personal electronics and headsets. They need to keep up with the times. And for the price they charge for tickets (not the price of low cost carriers), they really should provide competive beverages (ie. Wine, they are Italian after all!). Not competitive as an airline at all. And the toilets could use a good clean.

### "staff great"
Leaving from Paris 15 min delay we arrived in Rome on time with full access to the finger. The departure gate for the connecting Alitalia flight to Palermo was reached in 5 minutes. Flight to Palermo also ok and arrival only 5 minutes late, which is a very good average for the last flight of the day. Staff great and and new livery planes.

### "avoid if you can"
I had the worst customer service experience ever. Beware of Alitalia online booking because they hide lots of onerous conditions in some small print behind the main screen. I accidentally confirmed a london-milan return flight and realised the wrong departure date. I called the customer service immediately and they ignored it saying it was my fault to chose a tariff that does not allow changes and morover if you do not use one leg the other leg becomes void. None of these conditions were clearly spelled out but of course are scripted somewhere to give them legal safety. I lost £250 they just put the phone down on me. I tried then to call the Italian call centre and to add to the mistreatment they said that if I would have made the tickets via the Italian website they could have helped - but unfortunately I did in the uk website. As a customer you can only lose. Avoid if you can.

### "seat was comfortable"
I flew twice with  Alitalia from Bologna to Tokyo Narita (NRT) via Rome, and I recommend the airline. The service was good, staff very friendly and food also quite good. You could choose Italian or Japanese with sushi. The aircraft, a Boeing 777 was quite new and the seat was comfortable. Alitalia is improved quite a lot in the last years.

### "avoid this airline at any cost"
Budapest to Los Angeles via Rome. First and last time flying Alitalia. Initially I could not access the reservation online to choose seats (I wanted to get seats near the front as I was concerned about a tight connection in Rome), and when I called customer service was told there was an issue with the website, but not to worry the seats were arranged and our connection time was fine. Not allowed to check in online the day prior to the flight, and found the check in in Budapest to be a little disorganized, but the check in service was friendly. Flight from Budapest to Rome was okay, but took off 20 minutes late and was 40 minutes late to the gate. This left 20 minutes to get to our connecting flight to Los Angeles. We arrived in Terminal B, and were directed to the end of B to go through passport control and catch a shuttle to Terminal G. The shuttle service was highly disorganized and stressful, but we finally crammed into one. Raced through G to our gate to find a long line of people boarding a shuttle back to the side of the airport from which we had first been shuttled. Once we boarded and made our way to our seats, we discovered the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced. The headrests force your head forward at an awkward angle, there was a metal box under the front of one of our seats (entertainment system?) that prevented moving your feet at all, the pitch was the worst I have seen, and one of the seat trays was broken. Worse still, the plane clearly had not been cleaned between flights and in addition to sticky trays and armrests, there was a mass of long black hair stuck to the window. We were resolved to a miserable 13+ hour flight, but it just continued to get worse; no alcohol, even for purchase, beer and wine only. No choice of wine other that red or white, both bad. Truly awful food (how does Alitalia manage to screw up lasagna? ), bathrooms that reeked of urine and surly flight attendants. To be fair, I was feeling surly myself being stuck on such a miserable craft. Arrived in LA only 30 minutes late, but spent an extra 30 minutes after the other passengers at baggage claim hoping against hope our luggage would show. Of course not. It seems from looking at some of the other reviews that it might be a decent choice for short flights, but if you are doing a transatlantic route, avoid this airline at any cost.

### "extremely good value"
London to Milan in economy. Comfortable seats and nice refurbished plane. We were given a drink and some savoury snacks. The cabin crew the friendliest I have seen on Alitalia in years. We were given two free tickets to EXPO and one of the hostesses gave us her personal ticket for our daughter. Extremely good value.

### "remains an average airline"
Venice to Abu Dhabi. I had not flown with Alitalia since they became an Etihad Airways partner and decided to give them a try two weeks ago. Alitalia remains an average airline. I was lucky enough to get one of the ex-Etihad Airways A330 aircraft with the new Alitalia livery. This plane also featured the new Alitalia interiors and seats which are really elegant and do bring the colors of the Italian flag. The new IFE has now a wider screen, the selection of movies was good for this 5.5 hours flight. Cabin crew seemed to be nice but not to care that much of passengers. Their level of English has to be improved. Their uniforms look outdated now. Food was quite terrible, and the selection of drinks should be extended. No amenity kit distributed. Wifi connectivity was available on this flight but I personally did not test it. My baggage made its way to Abu Dhabi without any problems. Flight left Venice perfectly on-time and did land in Abu Dhabi 15 minutes ahead of schedule. It was not a bad experience all in all, but, in my opinion, there is still a lot to be done for Alitalia to become a premium airline.

### "the aisles very small"
Alitalia from New York to Rome. I understand that in a effort to cut costs, airlines have made the aisles very small and the leg room almost nonexistent. This makes for a very uncomfortable experience. The walkways are so small that you must turn to allow another passenger to walk by and usually rub body parts when doing so. On a long 9 hour flight, it is necessary and healthy to walk around the plane from time to time. This is virtually impossible to do without inconveniencing another passenger or the staff. Speaking of the staff, they don't seem incredibly happy with the tight quarters either. They are made to pass the cart through the small walkway, the cart is the only thing that fits in the tight space making it impossible for a passenger to go by and if you have your hand on the armrest or your foot out slightly they are sure to get crushed. When did passenger comfort become so unimportant?

### "delays on every leg"
Flight attendants were miserable and rude. Food was bland and cold and delays on every leg of the round trip. On arrival from Rome to Tel Aviv, my bag did not arrive – even though the departure was delayed by nearly an hour. Staff said "maybe" it would come on the next flight or "hopefully" it could be delivered the next day. On arrival from Rome to JFK, the flight was an hour late, causing missed connections. No entertainment on 3-hour medium haul flights. Rome FCO airport is a mess. Shuttle bus from plane to airport, then another bus from airport to plane – all when moving between gates in the same terminal.

### "staff was extremely rude"
My wife and I were coming back from our 1 year anniversary and we booked our Alitalia tickets from 6 months ago. We reserved our seats online and we even paid 140 euros more for the comfort seats. We get to the airport and check in and they say we are on standby. I asked why and he said they overbooked the plane. There was about 30 people that were not able to get on the plane because they overbooked the plane. We had to stay another night despite the fact I had work the next day. Then they delay our flight the next day because they have technical difficulties. The food was horrible and the staff was extremely rude. Worst experience and worst airline ever.

### "flights were on time"
Alitalia from Bologna to Catania via Roma. The flights were on time, the cabin crew was friendly even if the service has been very poor. But these are only short flights. Tidy and clean planes.

### "a rubbish experience"
Alitalia from Rome to Abu Dhabi, and it's not often one is called a d**k by cabin crew, rarer still by a female member of the crew. I a tall man, sitting in an aisle seat (41C?) had my legs crossed and shoe of the upper foot sticking out into the corridor, maybe 2cm. My fault. The hostess bangs against my foot, a frequent occurrence on a flight, and she then gives me this filthy stare and says 'Cazzo'. Maybe Italians use this like the Spanish use 'conjo,, it's lost its potency, it just means gosh darn, but the accompanying death stare suggested otherwise. They're a dreadful crew. The service was haughty, the crew out of sight after the meal service. Rome Airport was a nightmare, absolutely not up to the job of being a major airport. A rubbish experience. I give them a 1 for their nice terracotta red blankets.

### "better than we expected"
Generally a pleasant experience. Cabin crew provided good service and check in at Rome was reasonably quick, our baggage arrived with no problems. The inflight entertainment was only average. Overall better than we expected.

### "from Cagliari was shambolic"
Both Alitalia flights were late departing but the Friday evening from Cagliari was shambolic coupled with the Italian description and quantity of Hand Luggage. When you arrive at Rome the aircraft stops a long way from the terminal, this then gives the opportunity for some cramming whilst fighting for space with Hand Luggage. In we go to the terminal and then straight out again on to another bus back to possibly the same aircraft. Tried to buy a bottle of water, but the queue to pay had over 100 people waiting to hand their money over at the till! Should I have a need to go to Rome, it is most likely to be with a budget airline.

### "most hideous plane trip"
Our Alitalia flight from Rome to Boston was the most hideous plane trip I have ever taken. First we paid for Premium Economy and were sent an email 2 weeks before the flight to say we were being down graded and to call a # for assistance. We don't carry a cell when traveling and we tried to email the airline to no avail. We arrived in Rome via Barcelona and were seated in the rear of the plane in the middle. The bathrooms were disgusting, not cleaned, the seats were stained, the floor was not vacuumed and there was no in flight entertainment or updates to flight status. The food and service deplorable as well. The reading light over my seat was burned out. I had no way to read my book in the dark. Luckily I was sitting next to my husband who changed seats with me. If I had been sitting next to a stranger I might not have been able to read at all and 9 hours of sitting there with nothing to do; no inflight entertainment to speak of. The crew needs to check all the lights in the cabin so passengers who like to read on the plane are able to do so. A simple maintenance issue. We will never fly Alitalia again. We now have to try to get a refund for the money spent on premium economy which was not offered on the flight. The worst trip overseas ever! And we fly to Europe every year.

### "the seats were filthy"
Boston to Rome return with Alitalia, and this was without a doubt, the worst airline I have ever flown, domestic or international,. Approximately 10 days prior to our September 10th flight, I checked online to be sure our seat selections, too and from Rome were all set! We then find out the plane was changed to a smaller aircraft on both legs, hence the seat configuration was now different. I had a seat on both flights, but my husband did not! When I called Alitalia, I was told that our seats were confirmed as the original seats. I had to point out that the aircraft had changed, and those same seats were not available; "oh you're right" (from the other end of the phone)! We had to get to the airport extra early to get that mess straightened out. Shouldn't they have notified us that the aircraft had been changed, and we would need to go in and reselect seats? Once on the plane, it was one of the dirtiest I have ever seen, and old! The seats were filthy, covered with stains, the carpeting in the aisles was frayed, and there was no IFE in the seat backs. We had the luxury of trying to watch a movie on a drop down screen (completely blurry) in the middle aisle. The food was absolutely disgusting. I have to say, the return flight was even worse, as hard as that is to believe. The seat assignments were still all screwed up, and we went from having been assigned to row 24 to being assigned row 44. My seat cushion was like sitting in a hole, guess the springs, if there were any were shot. The seat across from me had no tray table, and the seat back as well as the armrest were duct tapped together. When the steward saw me taking pictures, he deliberately stood in my view. When approaching Boston, the steward went around distributing Customs forms - only problem, they were in Italian! When asked how am I supposed to complete this, the steward said you'll have to wait and get one in the terminal. Hello, the point of distributing them onboard is to avoid doing it in the terminal and avoid lines. As others mentioned, the stewards/stewardess were some of the rudest I have ever encountered. I will never, never fly Alitalia again.

### "a bad overall experience"
Alitalia was a combination of a substantial delay, horrible service and a bad overall experience. Most noteable was the service, or lack thereof. Well, maybe no service would have been better than the treatment we had to endure during this flight. Apparently, if you order a vegetarian meal, and another one, and receive a confirmation that your orders are OK, you should not trust it. At least mistrust was the attitude of the stewardess during the flight. When we asked why didn't we receive our vegetarian meals, the stewardess gave us the clear feeling that she did not believe that we had made the request in the first place. No effort was made to check if such meals could be offered. The food that we did eat and the food that others receivd, was nothing to write home about as well. The flight attendant had very little patience for us passengers and had to reprimand one of us in a rather rude manner. The only entertainment during the flight was the change of scenery outside the windows. Even the onboard magazine was old and well used.

### "something from 30 years ago"
Alitalia has been the worst airline I have ever flown with on our trip from Toronto to Rome. No legroom onboard the flight, and not even in-seat IFE screens. The plane reminded me of something from 30 years ago. It is ridiculous in this day and age for an airline such as Alitalia to offer such poor quality flights. Will never fly with them again. Our bags also arrived broken and dirt.

### "it was a nightmare experience"
I flew with Alitalia at the end of August 2015 from Boston to Rome. The plane had no individual IFE system. Its ridiculous that in this age, we have to see films on dropdown TVs (most of which didnt work anyway). Its not acceptable that Alitalia on long haul flights has planes with no individual IFE screens at each seat. The service onboard was barely okay. Seats were horribly uncomfortable, torn in places with stains everywhere. The food was a mess. Overall, it was a nightmare experience.

### "on an old, dirty plane"
Rome to Toronto with Alitalia, on an old, dirty plane. This was a 9 hour flight with no visual IFE - they did have a couple of bad music stations. Barely able to show safety movie on the dropdown screens that were only in middle of plane and seemed to be out of the 1970's. Seat / covers looked to be falling apart velcro didn't stick well. Terrible trip, especially when compared with our inbound Air France flight to Europe.

### "no reason not to fly them again"
Late flight out of London City Airport on a Sunday night. Relatively quick boarding. Offered a drink and a salty (savoury) snack. Seat relatively comfortable. It had some recline. Arrived about 10 mins early into Linate. Return flight was a mid week afternoon flight. Long walk to the gate from check in. Flight delayed around 20 mins due to late arrival of the inbound flight. As it was a day flight I noticed how grubby the cabin was. Very tired and worn out plane. Another drink and savoury snack offered. 90 mins or so in flight. Staff on both legs fine. Bags arrived at both ends within an acceptable time frame. Nothing extraordinary, but no reason not to fly them again.

### "aircraft clean and well maintained"
Return on Alitalia from Cagliari via Rome to Brussels. Outbound all flights left with a small delay but arrived on time. Return flight from Cagliari to Rome was delayed about 35-40 minutes so our connection in Rome was quite short. The plane Rome to Brussels waited for passengers and landed on time in Brussels. All aircraft clean and well maintained. Staff not overfriendly as in most cases with them,  but efficient drink / snack services overall. Alcohol beverages seem not possible anymore on their European flights, not even for purchase, which is a shame as we liked their wine selection.

### "the most horrendous experience"
Rome to Toronto Pearson with Alitalia, and the most horrendous experience in my entire travel career on this plane. First of all, Alitalia's website would not let me check in online. Then all good seats were taken at the airport, forcing my wife and I to sit in the middle 2 seats for the entire 9+hour journey. The plane itself was disgusting - it was a very old A330 painted with the "Skyteam" logo on the tail and a small Alitalia logo on the cockpit. The seats were  ripped, the carpet on the floor was ripped. No IFE, in fact: they couldn't even properly show us the video safety demonstration as only 2 of the 4 drop down monitors worked. My lumpy seat cushion was torn and the stained brown pad underneath gave me a choice of sliding forward only, or sitting up on the hard lump at the back for the entire 9+ hour journey. I really felt for the staff. They even suggested some of us complain, saying that the plane was supposed to be refurbished since July. Skyteam reject their membership until they can meet certain standards. This is an embarrassment to Delta, KLM, Air France and whoever else has Alitalia as a codeshare.

### "Cabin crew were not very friendly "
Madrid to Abu Dhabi via Rome, and I was a bit worried about flying with Alitalia, but it wasn't that bad. The leg from Madrid to Rome was as with any other European airline. Small snack and drink served during the flight. The flight Rome to Abu Dhabi on an A330 was pleasant as well. IFE system with a fair choice of movies and music. Cabin crew were not very friendly and couldn't see them during the flight. They disappeared after serving dinner. Dinner was ok, I had pasta and wasnt too bad. Seat pitch very average.

### "personal IFE which was great"
We flew Alitalia from Chicago O'Hare to Pisa via Rome. Check-in was fast and boarding was quick as well. When we got on it was a pleasant feeling. The cabin had real Italian colors. The seats were a little narrow but not too bad. We had personal IFE which was great. We left on time and drinks and food came fast. The meal was good but too little. We had a nice sleep during the flight and arrived to Rome refreshed. The immigration was fast and the next leg was operated by Etihad Regional. They gave snacks and drinks for this short flight. Hopefully Alitalia will improve even more!

### "Alitalia was a fail on every level"
Rome to Los Angeles on Alitalia was the most uncomfortable flight ever. Imagine, you know you're going to spend 11+ hours in a seat and from the first moment you realize it will never be comfortable. Other shorter travelers may have a better experience but not for my 5'10", as the headrest pushed my head forward in an awkward position. I had to put my neck pillow behind my back to make it at all tolerable. I wish I could report that the service, food, entertainment all balanced this out - but it was a fail on every level. The only thing good I can say is that both flights were on time.

### "we were greeted by grumpy and rude staff"
Alitalia flight from Rome to Los Angeles, and the aircraft were outdated and seats ridiculously cramped. There is no wifi onboard and no plugs for computer or phones. But the worst part of this airline was customer service. At our check in at Fiumicino airport we were greeted by grumpy and rude staff. We had been told by phone that with a doctor's letter my mother could have a more comfortable seat as she suffers from arthritis, we got the letter and even paying for it, they could not secure that seat. The check in staff sighed constantly and made the experience painful. Many times I asked if there was something wrong and she would roll her eyes again. Not only the rudeness, but she printed our boarding passes wrong and only after waiting in line for customs we realized.

### "I've never had any issue"
I flew Rome to Milan (LIN) and return several times with Alitalia and I've never had any issue. Flights punctual and professional staff, the food service is the same of all intra-european flights, a little bit poor but ok for such a short houl - a small pocket of bisuits or salty snacks and a soft drink. Will fly them again.

### "I am still waiting to fly to Rome"
I am still waiting to fly Alitalia from London to Rome today. There is no communication from Alitalia help desk, they only give food vouchers out. I've already missed my connection flight and no information given.

### "not as fantastic as we expected"
Flew Alitalia from Milan to New York. Seats were very comfortable. Leg room very good for people as tall as 185cm. Service on board: food pretty good but not as fantastic as we expected it to be. Punctuality: on time on departure and on arrival. Landing: very smooth despite the very bad weather conditions.

### "very frustrating and stressful"
Economy flight with Alitalia is very frustrating and stressful. Departure Gate changed Last minute, no announcement or signs to advise. Seats onboard unclean and storage pouch hanging partly torn away, hanging on my leg. The cabin staff were pleasant enough. They lost my luggage, despite an immediate report at Baggage Claims, the process was very poor for recovery. So 3 days later no luggage yet, and no answer at Customer Service.

### "the best I've experienced"
Alitalia Classe Magnifica is the best I've experienced. The crew on all four flights (Rio de Janeiro to Brussels via Rome, return) were very welcoming and enthusiastic. It was a delight to try all the top class Italian wines and food, and the crew were pleased to explain history and location of the cuisine and wine. Seat full lie-flat is better than business class on other European airlines I've travelled.

### Alitalia customer review
Milan Linate to Barcelona return. Outbound flight in economy, return in business. I booked only 2 weeks in advance and ticket was at par with most low-costs. Economy was clean, adequate service for a 1 hour flight. Business class was better than other airlines that I have flown on European routes. Very attentive service, excellent food, selection of beverages could be better but for a 1 hour flight I shouldn't complain.

### Alitalia customer review
Fiumicino: At the check-in desks, there was such a mess and disorganisation that most passengers were going to miss their flight. I was one of them. Arriving almost 2 hours in advance, I wait my turn in one single line for all the flights (no prioritisation). Once it was finally my turn they tell me that the flight is overbooked. I paid for my seat (chosen with additional fee) more than 800 euro and they tell me it is overbooked. After more than the time needed, they finally check me in and they tell me to speed up and go to the gate. I run like crazy until I arrive at my seat. Inflight Experience: I discover that my entertainment system was broken. Now imagine a 12 hour non-stop flight without an entertainment system. I asked more than one hostess to assist me and change my seat but they continuously told me that the flight was overbooked. They didn't apologise. I could not even light up my light (since it was connected to the system). Thankfully I had my kindle with me and was able to read for 8 hours. Once again, the bad service did not stop at Fiumicino and in-air. LAX: Upon arrival, my baggage was not there. I waited 3 days to get my luggage. I will never fly again with Alitalia.

### Alitalia customer review
Very disappointing. Seats were uncomfortable, with a headrest that pushes your head forward. Seats and tray tables were not clean. On this hot summer day, they 'ran out of beer' during the first drink service at the beginning of a 13+ hour flight. No whiskey or spirits, choices of alcohol were red or white wine only. Cabin crew were particularly surly, right from the start. Flew Jetstar Tokyo to Cairns two weeks after this flight, and this LCC was infinitely better, in every department, than Alitalia.

### Alitalia customer review
Alitalia may change your departure time after you buy your ticket. Alitalia did this to my wife who is traveling alone with our nine-month-old daughter. Because Alitalia changed her departure time she will now miss her Alitalia connection in Rome on Tuesday. The airline put her on a flight to New York. We live in Chicago, and she’s traveling alone with our baby girl! The additional layover will add another flight and four hours to her trip from Europe. It’s a terrible deal for us but a great deal for Alitalia. We never would have bought the ticket with an additional layover, but now Alitalia has duped us into paying a one-stop premium for a two-stop itinerary. I tried to contact Alitalia Customer Relations but they will not respond.

### Alitalia customer review
Milan to Rome, crew friendly and attentive. Return flight delayed by 20 minutes, crew nice, offered a snack both ways and drink. A good experience and very low price.

### Alitalia customer review
Alitalia has improved its service. Very attentive crew, even if the food was not consistent. Only snacks and beverages. In economy, the seats are average. No inflight entertainment but since the flights lasted less than 2 hours so it was no problem. They treat frequent fliers very good and I definitely reccomend it.

### Alitalia customer review
The staff are so rude and do not like to take responsibility for anything. We were told at London check in that our suitcases would go straight on to Tirana. Only to find out after a layover in Rome that out suitcases were not on the plane - they were left in Rome. Constant phone calls and trips to Tirana airport to find what was going on, and still left in the dark about it. Staff said there is nothing they can do - it will turn up when it turns up.

### Alitalia customer review
Alitalia to Cagliari via Rome from London. Food and drink was basic with the choice of water juice or coke with a snack. However considering it was cheaper than easyjet, I would recommend Alitalia due to free checked baggage and air miles.

### Alitalia customer review
Alitalia has not improved. At Rome airport we had to go to one gate and bus to another gate. When we got there there was no sign that this was the gate for the London flight as the Air Algerie sign for an Algiers was left up. Alitalia staff eventually arrived but didn't change the sign. When I asked a supervising member of staff why this wasn't done, especially considering the gate change, they offered no explanation let alone apology. When I said "no wonder people don't want to fly Alitalia! , his response was "Well why do you? Customer service at its best! Budget airlines like Easyjet are better. The two hour flight was delayed 1.5 hours. No coffee or tea served on board, only water and juice. No beer or wine available even for purchase. Sloppy non service. Avoid Alitalia at all costs

### Alitalia customer review
Excellent flight, full assistance and great staff. Simple snack with dolce and salato plus drink, but finally very very good flight. Both flights arrived ahead of time.

### Alitalia customer review
Delay due to technical reasons little by little increased to six hours. Gate staff in Vienna completely uncooperative, told that rebookings will only be made for international onward flights. At the ticket counter, eventually rebooked to the next morning on Lufthansa. Took two hours to find and give back my bag. Not willing to accommodate any passengers on the other Alitalia flight or any others that day. End of the story: the flight eventually got cancelled around 10 p.m.

### Alitalia customer review
Flight there cancelled, see earlier review. Return flight connecting to Niki (Air Berlin) in Rome. Could not check in the bag at Napoli before the previous flight to Rome had closed so less time in lounge. Shouted at by rude check in staff with incomprehensible English. Flights delayed due to Rome airport traffic. Actual flight okay, but flight attendants uncoordinated. Needless to say baggage didn't arrive. Agent at lost baggage informed me that this is routinely the case with Alitalia and that it usually takes up to three days to relocate bags.

### Alitalia customer review
There was no in-flight entertainment. Even the flight tracker was broken and the display wasn't clear. Our attempts to get the flight attendants attention went unnoticed. I assume they follow processes that have no room for extra customer requests. The flights were great, the pilots did a great job. The planes seemed new, but there was trash in the magazine compartment, with magazines themselves dirty or missing. Overall, not much to do on a cross-atlantic flight, make sure you have your own entertainment. Do not fly through Rome, it's pretty disorganized after their international terminal had a fire (we missed a connection flight), use of overloaded shuttle buses, etc. I would fly again only if it's a much cheaper option.

### Alitalia customer review
Excellent food and wine, good overall service with the possibility to eat at a time of your choice. The service is in line with the best European Airlines and better than any North American Airline. In-flight entertainment was good, with wide selection of movies on in-seat monitors. Seats are comfortable and are completely flat for sleeping. Beauty case is given also for daytime flights.

### Alitalia customer review
Both ground crew and flight attendants lack customer satisfaction skills - treat the customer with indifference. Pre-booked seats outbound and inbound only to find they changed seats both ways without any communication. Plane was old and seats were very uncomfortable. Large TV monitors ran down the middle aisle every 6-7 rows and most didn't work properly. Food was mediocre. Terrible, terrible airline. I would never recommend Alitalia.

### Alitalia customer review
On June 25, 2015 we flew back to Toronto from Rome after a Mediterranean cruise. This flight had been booked in October 2014, and the seats reserved. They changed our seats and put us in the very last row, where the seats don't recline and between 2 toilets. Apparently they can change your seats whenever they want. So we spent nine hours listening to the toilets flush, no windows, could not recline the seats, while the seats in front of us were right in our face. The food was so bad. The plane was an old one, with one small TV screen every 8 rows, and the one closest to us didn't work. We will never fly with this airline again.

### Alitalia customer review
My flight and subsequent experience with Alitalia, was the worst I have had. The flight attendants were rude, they forgot to give me a meal and when reminded, in a polite way, they didn't ever produce a meal. Luckily it was an overnight flight so not essential. On arrival in Rome, this was a direct flight, my luggage was lost / delayed. I spent a week in Tuscany minus any change of clothing, trying to locate the luggage by phoning frequently (several Italian speaking friends also helped me by trying to connect with customer service), to no avail. I was in a remote area, so could not even shop for essentials. When someone finally answered the phone they had no knowledge as to where my suitcase was. At the end of the week, after a spoiled vacation, I still encountered difficulties at the Rome airport. I was sent from one terminal to another, by very disinterested staff. in order to reunite with my luggage. The whole experience left me with a very negative impression of Alitalia and its staff.

### Alitalia customer review
I flew from Tirana to London via Rome and in general I was quite happy with the experience. Flight from Tirana to Rome departed on time at 5.45 am. Although it was a short flight of only an hour we were still served snacks and drinks. Same happened from Rome to London City Airport, where I flew on an Embraer plane. On the return flights, due to the whole plane being full, I was forced to book first class, which was actually the first time for me. London-Rome we were served Italian bread with prosciutto and some ice cream. Same from Rome to Tirana. Cabin crew were kind and polite on all four flights. When I entered the Rome-London flight, my seat was dirty and sticky but a cabin attendant cleaned it immediately. I was happy overall.

### Alitalia customer review
This plane had to have been made in the 90's or even earlier, it was so old and outdated. One small TV per 30 seats. Our flight was an overnight flight that left at 11pm and the lights were turned off for take-off and everyone got cozy just in time for them to turn the lights on at 12.15am to serve dinner, which wasn't appropriate for either time zone. They kept the lights on until 1.30am. The worst part - the flight attendants went to sleep in their reserved extra large seats with leg rests in the middle of the economy class. Not only did 6 of them go to sleep on the plane, but they put up a blanket divider around their section which was attached to the overhead compartments with velcro, and laid completely in front of the seat in front of me, blocking the pocket to store things. Food was awful. Service was awful. Attendants were rude.

### Alitalia customer review
Horrible experience. Both on departure than on return. To start with we had a delay of more than 2 hours because of a problematic passenger (not company's fault) but no A/C and nothing was made to make it up. On return both flights were late and I almost missed my correspondance in Rome due to a late landing and messy airport organisation. On top of that Alitalia lost my luggage. Will never flight again with them, even if I have to pay more for others.

### Alitalia customer review
Worst flight to Europe in many years! Tightest seating, surly cabin crew, bad food and service. Would never have booked Alitalia except for the fact that this was a hard-to-see code share' booked on Delta internet site. In my book this makes Delta an accomplice. Don't they know Alitalia is dramatically substandard compared to Delta?

This is the first time I have flown with Alitalia from Brussels to Rome and back. I think they are not better or worse than other airlines in Europe. Seats are comfortable and you actually have a nice legroom. Personel are attentive. Alitalia still serves drinks and a little snack for free, while other national carriers start charging for it. Flight from Brussels to Rome departed on time and arrived ahead of schedule in Rome. Flight from Rome to Brussels departed with delay but that was due to the chaos on Rome Fiumucino, but landed on time in Brussels. My father needed wheelchair assistance and that was organised by Alitalia without any problems. I certainly would fly them again to Rome.

Both flights are fairly short, however the E-195 cabin is much more comfortable, spacious and modern than the much older A320 that Alitalia used on the Rome - Amsterdam route. Both flights had underwhelming catering onboard. Other than drinks and a few snacks, no real meals were served. On my way from Amsterdam to Rome, I had an Alitalia flight number, but the flight was operated by KLM and they had great sandwich options onboard.

Booked a business class ticket, I regret it as it was nowhere near a business standard. No Lounge. No amenities. Not even a pillow. Old aircrafts. If you must travel with this airline, do not bother paying for business class, they do not have one. You will get packed in like sardines on buses to connect from one flight to another.

Bucharest to New York JFK via Rome FCO. To save time at our connection in FCO (only 45 minutes! ), the Alitalia check-in employee gave us boarding passes for OTP-FCO and FCO-JFK, however the check-in line was very slow. First flight was normal with nothing special. Flight was delayed by 15 minutes due to air-traffic in Rome. Fairly clean aircraft. They served us some crackers, but nothing more. However, never fly Alitalia long-haul economy unless it's your only option! Ground services were pretty slow. We had to wait 15 minutes for a bus to drive us to terminal 3! Flight to New York also delayed, this time by an hour. Seats in the plane were extremely uncomfortable, there was an entertainment equipment box blocking me from having legroom, outdated entertainment systems, and bad food. That's why Alitalia plane tickets are so cheap.

### Alitalia customer review
We had flown with Alitalia many times in the past thirty years, and we had always been satisfied with the cabin crew and, of course, with the food and wine. Last year we choose Classica Plus, and it was great. This year we choose regular economy. Actually, before Classica Plus, we always flew economy, and choose Alitalia over its partner, Delta, because of its food service. This time we just couldn't believe it. The New York to Rome flight meal service consisted of dessicated pasta and a couscous salad. No vegetables, no cheese, and a stale roll. We thought it was because of an American supplier that didn't understand that this would be an unacceptable meal for an Italian. We were wrong. On the return flight we had a two-pasta combination which was terrible, and a salad of rice. Before landing, we were served an anemic muffin with no butter or jelly. I guess the new owners have no intention of continuing the wonderful cabin service that we have had in the past. We will now choose Delta.

Check-in smooth, Priority Security Line, excellent new Preludium Lounge at Warsaw Airport, one of the nicest loungest I've seen. Boarding on time. Quite old A320, with only 1.5 rows of Business Class. No welcome drink, but newspapers and magazines offered, Italian only. After take off - hot towels and meal, which was horrible. From an  Italian airline I'd expect great Italian food and wines, but I got some mushroom salad with "feta"-like cheese and hot cottage cheese mixed with tomato sauce - inedible. There was no choice of wines, only one kind of each, I took red, but again, poor quality. Except wine glass on a tray, all other drinks were served in a plastic cup. After dinner, grappa and limoncello was served, again in plastic, but limoncello was too strong for my taste. Cabin crew was very nice and perfectly groomed, but food was disaster. No inflight magazine available in any seat pocket, only old and damaged shopping catalogue. Not recommended.

We arrived at Cagliari airport 3 hours ahead of time so we would be first in line. We explained at the desk that we had a 50 minute connection to make. Because we were travelling with a baby we had to go to the transfers desk in Amsterdam airport to print our boarding pass, so we could not check in early for our international flight. The lady at the desk was rude and surly. She said she would "See what she could do. When we asked for seats near the front of the plane so we would have time to make it to our connecting flight. What she could do" was to place us and our two children at the very back of the plane in the very last row where we would have to watch every single other person disembark before us. The plane was 70% full, and there were many seats available near the front of the plane. After this she printed off our tags for checking our bags. She showed us one, showing that the bag would make it all the way to our final destination. All the other labels she didn't show us, and they all were going to the wrong airport altogether. Luckily my wife noticed our stroller tag and ran back to talk to someone else who wasn't so rude. We booked our flights through KLM, and unfortunately had to finish the flight to Sardinia via Alitalia. When we got to the desk to check in (again because we had small children) there was a lot of head scratching and confusion. They tried to charge us for our baggage that we had already paid for, which would have cost us an additional $200 Euros. We booked our flight through KLM and all our bags are entitled to go with us from start to finish. So after an hour at the desk while they made snide comments again we were placed at the very back of the plane. From start to finish the ground crew were rude and dismissive.

### Alitalia customer review
The cabin was staffed with quite a few FAs and we were told that the F&B manager was on board making sure that the service was up to standard for their new something or other ... it was a long spiel. Cabin seemed new, leather and seats reclined nearly but not completely flat. Food was a disaster and my expectations had been raised by the greeting. I ordered the veal (a mistake) and it was tough as I expected but the sauce that was on it was so salty that it was inedible. My traveling partner did not eat as he was asleep. When I asked for something else, I was told that only pre-made cheese plates were left and they all have blue cheese on them to which I am allergic. After that, it seemed that everyone was busy and no beverages or anything else was offered for the remaining four hours of the flight. When the plane was landing, I was asked for feedback and I said that I was hungry since they had no other food. The FA said they did have more food, and offered me something but at that point the trays had to be stowed, etc. I am not sure why this was handled so poorly, I was polite and understand that the crew does not make the food. Even some bread or any other option would have been appreciated and since the person I traveled with did not eat and some seats were empty, it seems odd that they thought they ran out of all other food options.

### Alitalia customer review
Boarding via busses was rather chaotic, some people needed to check in their hand luggage, others not. The flight was operated by Air One. Cabin was clean but worn out, several seats were disfunctional. The seat pitch was the smallest I have had in any airplane. I am just under 6ft and with normal weight, but I could not sit in any position without my knees being crushed by the seat in front of me. Shortly after start the man in front ofme reclined his seat (reclining is very limited) but this made any further movement impossible. The person in front of me claimed that he did not understand English, the stewardess tried to convince him to move his chair upright but he refused. Stewardess told me that it is his right to recline. Fortunately, it was just a little over one hour flight. Cabin attendants were friendly, served a soft drink and sweet or savory snack. Disembarking the plane was again chaotic, the first bus left the tarmac half empty, the second and last bus was overcrowded and felt suffocating, standing in the hot noon sun with doors closed for too long. It is difficult to avoid this airline whenever travelling in Italy, I also had better experiences with Alitalia (but you never know if it is carried out by one of their partners, it was not stated when I checked-in).

Verona to Barcelona on Embraer 175 departed late. The flight was good and the cabin crew was arranged of two staff. The flight from Rome to Barcelona departed late due to airport problems. The crew was helpful and smiling. The flight was cheaper then Ryanair.

### Alitalia customer review
Completely lacking the generosity of Italy. Alitalia may have a new livery but only serve a cup of coffee, water or OJ and some biscotti. I was starving and hoped to buy a sandwich and a glass of wine or Camparisoda. My next trip to Italy will be on easyJet, air Berlin or Ryanair.

### Alitalia customer review
Flight AZ165 from Brussels to Rome, Fiumicino on 5th June 2015. I was one of the passengers that were on time to the airport and at the right gate (A59). That wasn't the case with the crew who were late because of traffic problems! Airport announced that boarding wasn't possible at 17.55, we were told to board at 18.40. I was reassured that not only I would catch my flight from Rome to Athens (AZ722), but also I would have time for an espresso in Fiumicino! Meanwhile, Brussels weather deteriorated giving us the pleasure of being stay stuck inside the aircraft until 20.15. I agree that bad weather in Brussels Airport is not the airlines responsibility, but if the crew had been on time, the pilot wouldn't have lost the slot and the rest of our journey would have continued normally. On arrival at Fiumicino, all passengers stood in long queues from 22.30 to 23.59! When we finished, we entered a bus that should take us at Sheraton Hotel, about 20 minutes away. About half an hour later, the bus departed. I had to leave the hotel at 06.30. No time for espresso, no time for anything else. My new flight to Athens was waiting for me at 08.40, and again I would be on time. I wondered if your pilots would also be, fortunately this time they did.

### Alitalia customer review
Flew VCE-AUH-VCE with a superb launch fare of just £320 return. Both legs we had very modern and clean A330's with great AVOD. Unfortunately for Alitalia but fortunately for us the flight ran with less than 30 pax on the way out and less than 60 on the way back so everyone could spread around. Both flights on-time with good food and competent crews. The only bugbear is you'd think with a crew to guest ratio of 3-1 that it wouldn't kill the crew to do a few water runs inflight. The return flight had Etihad crew supervising so maybe the Alitalia crew will no longer (famously) spend the entire flight behind the galley curtain.

### Alitalia customer review
We flew as a party of 2 from London Heathrow to Naples changing at Milan Linate. On all 4 flights the cabin crew were just adequate with friendliness. There was no information about transfer instructions when reaching Milan we had to find it out ourselves. You have no choice of an alcoholic drink only tea/coffee or juice and the cups are small and only half filled and you only get given a very small bag of biscuits. I know they are only short hall flights but as a frequent flyer with BA we are offered a full range or food and drinks. Bags arrived where they should have but would not fly with Alitalia again.

### Alitalia customer review
London City to Bari via Rome Bari to Heathrow via Linate. Slow bag drop at City but quickly through security. Flight to Rome fine. Rome Fumicino still a shambles after the fire lucky we had a long wait for the slightly late Bari flight as transiting was a nightmare. Home trip on time both legs and very fast. Nice crews drinks and snacks adequate. Fare was half that of BA and Easyjet at the UK half term break.

I flew from LIN to CPH and back. The in-bound flight took off on time and landed ahead of scheduled in Copenhagen the return flight from Denmark landed on time in Milan. Plenty of legroom super competitive price (100€ round trip) quick and organized boarding (with rear rows getting in first and front rows after) and good pilots who made the flight pleasant and safe. Basic snacks and drinks but on similar short flights I have not seen other airlines giving more.

Flight AZ 355 Nice-Rome 31st May 2015. Boarded on time at 18:. (flight was supposed to take off 18.35) After two hours seated inside the aircraft the Captain announced a Non Repairable technical problem and invited all passengers to disembark. The shore staff were totally lost and confused fighting each other in deciding what to do with us. We have been escorted outside the security area and left with no information for another two hours after that I left the airport at 22.00 hours and went back home. No a single glass of water was offered to the unlucky passengers.

### Alitalia customer review
Upon our arrival to Rome from JFK on May 7th we were notified that Rome Airport was closed to outgoing traffic. The Alitalia representatives were very disorganized. Different representatives dispensed different information at the Rome Airport. As a result of the Terminal 3 fire at Rome Airport we were only offered water during our 39 hours at the airport. We waited 4 hours on line to get airline tickets to Turkey and as a result missed a wedding that we were supposed to attend we never got to attend. We had to eat all our meals at the airport in addition to trying to sleep at the Rome Airport seriously would consider not flying Alitalia in the near future.

### Alitalia customer review
Flown on FCO-NRT and back in November 2014. For the first segment I was Economy Plus. Just a waste of money. So no need to waste also time in reviewing it. On the way back I asked on board the upgrade against 800€. The seat is a real lie flat but somehow is feel a bit cheap and "fragile". The mattress is also a bit hard and is very uncomfortable for tall people the foot space that is very narrow and requires a lot off efforts to turn your body on the other side.. The grey design doesn't help as well: a bit boring. The amenity kid is just ok. The entertaining system is fine even thought he selection of film is not as nice as on other higher level airlines. The food is the only nice point: different choices of antipasti first course second course and dessert offered you on a tray: you can even taste a bit of everything. Also good selection of wines. The disappointing thing is professionally and the level of the service. I won't comment the ground customer service that is just shameful: nobody knows nothing or would better to say everybody gives you info that most of the time is just a personal guess. On board the service is a bit improvised and basically depends on the individual character of the attendant: if he/she is a nice one it all be nice. On the opposite if bad will be very rude. In any case it is unprofessional as there is clearly a luck of training and service minimal standards.

### Alitalia customer review
Our flight from Palermo to Rome was delayed for about three hours. A a result of this we missed the connecting flight to Amsterdam. This can happen. However travellers were never informed by Alitalia about the problems at Fiumincino airport. At Palermo airport no one mentioned the cause of so many planes being delayed. One had to fight oneself into a queue in order to get some information of the staff member who - as so often in Italy - hardly spoke any English. Arriving at Fiumincino airport in Rome the staff of Alitalia did not offer any service. We had to stay in the airport and were not even offered a cop of coffee tea or something to eat. Alitalia did not show any concern nor did they apologize for the circumstances. Travellers were completely ignored.

Athens to Roma in Economy. Boarding was good but it turned rather bad once on-board. A women who decided that she wanted a window seat even though she did not have one just sat in one. This than created all kinds of drama. The mans seat who's this was asked her to move and she refused. He called a flight attendant and even she could not get her to move. She was glued to that seat and that was that. So the man had to move seats but he was with his wife and they wanted to seat together so all up 3 rows were shuffled to accommodate this women who wanted a window seat. Why the flight attendant just didn't move the original offender is beyond me. Once underway all was good. Short flight so no entertainment and a simple drink and nuts. Luggage was out quick in Roma.

Flew from Miami to Rome and back in March 2015. Most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced on an airplane. The permanently attached head rest actually pushes your head/neck forward . Flight was too warm on return and even though 11 hour flight water seldom offered. Little English spoke by flight attendants. Very difficult to check in online if you purchased on Delta Airlines website.

Flew LAX to Rome Premium Economy on May 7. Overall a very poor product. Does not compare to other International Premium Economy offerings.

LHR-LIN and LIN-LHR economy. The cabin crew were extremely helpful and kind. Food is limited to a snack and a drink. Drink choice is limited (they do not have apple juice although it is a favourite of many kids). Comfortable and spacious seat. On time in both directions. Very good flights overall. No flight entertainment is provided (less than 2 hours flight). Better than most of 5-star rated Asian airlines I flew with.

BLQ-FCO-MAD and return. Both flights were on times. Operated by a A319 and A321 with 3-3 configurations and average legs space. The cabin crew has been very friendly and helpful and the landing in Madrid was excellent. Good service and good food. I will fly again with AZ.

FCO-AOI-FCO and FCO-PSA-FCO. The flights to and from Ancona operated with an A319 instead of ATR-72 as scheduled which was too big for such a short route and in fact it was quite empty. On the flights to Pisa Alitalia uses Etihad Regional's ATR-72 that's a very nice and comfortable little aircraft appropriate for this route. Cabin crew professional the food service is pretty much the same used on European flights.

YYZ-FCO-TLV in economy. After reading some of the reviews here I expected a terrible experience. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The aircraft on the YYZ-FCO leg was a refurbished A330-200 with personal entertainment systems and decent seat pitch. Flight left a few minutes ahead of schedule and arrived on time. I rated a vegan meal (VGML) which was surprisingly good and nutritious and ample drinks were offered including wine. Staff spoke good English and were alright not the friendliest I've had but sufficient. The 3 hour flight from Rome to Tel Aviv was on an A319. Busses took us to the remotely parked aircraft and we departure about 30 minutes late. Nevertheless arrived on time. Food was served on this short flight which was surprising; cold appetizer but you definitely can't complain! Staff was actually friendlier on this short leg. The slim leather seats weren't very comfortable but alright for a short flight. Overall excellent value for the $800CAD round-trip. This may not be the best airline I've flown on but definitely not as bad as I thought. Bottom line - will fly them again.

I am of Italian background and live in Scotland. I decided to take my elderly mother-in-law to Italy for a holiday. We had an efficient and friendly flight with BA from Edinburgh to Heathrow where we connected to Alitalia. The contrast between the friendly BA staff and the rather surly and unhelpful Alitalia staff was shocking. While our flight to Italy took off with a minimal delay the service was minimal with only a snack served and a murky tea. We had to transfer in Milan for a flight to Naples and pass through chaotic 'security'. I was not impressed at all with the internal Alitalia flight as the staff seemed only interested in exchanging gossip over passengers. My mother-in-law requested a glass of water and was ignored. Certain so-called no frills airlines offer a much better service than Alitalia. I felt ashamed that the flag carrier of Italy could not do better.

### Alitalia customer review
JFK-FCO. Check-In at JFK was a complete hassle. The agents were friendly but they were completely oblivious to what a Schengen Visa meant. Anyway once on board everything was fine. Brand new A330 with comfortable seats. Recline and legroom was decent although it did feel very tight once the person in front of me reclined. Entertainment options was decent and they had some recent movies as part of their selection. My only complaint is that the screen was extremely unresponsive. Food was average ordered the Seafood Meal and it was delicious. The pre-arrival snack was a disappointment it was literally the same tuna salad served as the side during dinner but slapped between sliced bread. Crew was professional and efficient but were not warm or friendly. Only complaint in terms of service is the lack of beverage runs during the flight. They seem to be too worried resting in their crew rests area (at the back of the plane) and even turned off my service call without asking me if I needed anything. Appalling. Overall a decent product but I would fly on another airline for better service but they're not as bad as people perceived them to be.

AZ611 on 3/18 and AZ608 on 3/26. After reading the reviews of Alitalia on this website I was terrified for my recent trip from JFK to FCO on 3/18. My experience was excellent! All the Alitalia employees we encountered were friendly happy and very eager to make our experience as pleasant as possible. The aircraft was clean with plenty of room for carry on. I was even impressed with the cleanliness for the bathrooms during our 8 then return 10 hour flights. No lost luggage like many reviewers complained of. Individual TVs with plenty of viewing options. We flew coach and was way more comfortable than domestic coach seating. Would absolutely fly with Alitalia in the future. Months of obsessing about a terrible experience were for nothing!

After reading the reviews I also had negative thoughts regarding my pending flight from Heathrow to Rome. Check in at the airport was possibly the quickest we have ever had no queuing pleasant staff also. Departed on time arrived on time. The return journey proved to be just as good. Regarding the onboard staff we found them very helpful and attentive especially to one of the passengers who appeared to be in some discomfort always asking and checking they were OK.

I took a round trip flight from Rome to Miami. The flights were the worst in terms of seat comfort and food. The so called "head rest" of the seat has made the flights very uncomfortable. The legroom was very short and on top of that there was a metal box on the floor occupying my foot room. I have never seen anything like this before! I will never take an Alitalia flight again!

I have always flown with Alitalia. This is the second time I flew on a 777 and the seats were absolutely hideous. The headrest pushes your head forward making the long journey painful. I couldn't help but notice all the other passengers many were trying to lift or lower the headrest with hopes of making the seating more comfortable. That did not happen. I also would like to spend a second and mention the food. I never have expectations on the food it's not so important for me but this last flight I took with Alitalia the food was very poor and very little of it.

We flew Toronto - Rome - Toronto. Sept 2014. Going was okay. Returning was a degrading flight. The plane was a throwback to the '80s and the crew were about as friendly as garden snails. I will not fly that draconian airline again. Given the questions listed below I assume because we chose economy class it is likely our views won't matter. However do not allude to thinking our experience will not seep into the general public who are smarter travellers and shop not only for prices.

FCO-PRG on an A320. The check in staff were surly. The plane departed approximately 20 mins late but through no fault of Alitalia. The cabin cleanliness was appalling. The plane smelt dank in the bathroom. The service was variable with pretty poor cabin presence. There was no IFE and the seat was uncomfortable. The food (a packet of biscuits) was ok but the use of powdered milk with coffee was a big no no. There aren't really any advantages to flying Alitalia over a low cost airline- I wouldn't recommend it.

7th Jan AZ 809. Return 10th Jan AZ 812. TLV-FCO-TLV in economy I was dreading this flight after reading the reviews and having faint memories of my Alitalia flights over 10 years ago. The price was very reasonable and not much more than easyjet so I went with Alitalia. The plane out was an old A320 but refurbished so looked ok and was in a decent condition. I was very impressed with the seat pitch and comfort it was great  better than most economy I've tried on other airlines. The food is very basic and their is no flight entertainment but anyway it a short 3 hour flight. Same experience on the way back and i was very satisfied with the overall experience. Both flight on time and luggage was very quickly delivered. The crew were polite and friendly and id what they needed to do. I would definitely use them again especially if the prices remain competitive.

We were re-booked on an Alitalia flight ex AUH to Rome on 04/01 due to the 'fog chaos' at AUH on 03/01 and the subsequent missing of our original booked Etihad flight AUH-BRU. The Alitalia business class on their A330 is quite similar to Etihad's. The plane was clean IFE system decent. The biggest disappointment however was the crew and their (non) service. The welcome drink which other airlines offer business class passengers when they are installed at their seat was offered when the plane was pushed off the gate more than 1 hour after boarding (we had to wait for transit passengers from late incoming flights). Breakfast was offered 2 hours after departure without having seen any flight attendant whatsoever between take off and breakfast being served. Once the breakfast trays were collected the crew disappeared again and we just saw now and then stewardesses passing through the cabin as if they thought they were movie stars totally ignoring passengers. Even when the captain announced the descend till the landing itself the crew preferred not to appear did not bother to check if seat belts were fastened tray tables stowed away and seats were in upright position. Most window screens were even still closed when we landed which I believe is against regulations. I don't think I ever experienced a crew which had so few interest in its passengers. It was clear that we were regarded as an annoyance and just disturbed their chit chat sessions. No wonder this airline has been on the edge of bankruptcy several times and I'm surprised that their parent company being Etihad accepts this kind of attitude from their personnel.

CAI-FCO-MLA - both legs departed on time and arrived early. Tickets were a bargain compared to other airlines especially since it's a busy season. The biggest disappointment was the aircraft itself. Both legs were A319 with the hardest seats I have experienced. The pillows provided were wafer thin. On the CAI-FCO leg there was no IFE at all despite it being a 3-hour flight and there were screens installed in the seats. Not even a map or a shared movie. Service was ok and food was pretty basic.

Saga began when I tried to book a seat several weeks prior to boarding. I went to the website and tried to follow the instructions but was unable to reserve a seat. Despite several attempts to do this over the next few days it would not work so I decided to go to the airport extra early (5 hours in advance of my flight). There were no aisle seats left despite me being so early so I decided to go ahead and book a “comfort” seat for which I was charged an additional 85 euros. Onboard I get to my “comfort” seat which is the aisle seat at the front right beside the washrooms. The aisle where everyone crosses in front of you. The man sitting beside me had also paid extra. His seat was ripped and the stuffing was coming out. He moved to the next seat over. Meanwhile people who had not paid the extra asked if they could sit in the other comfort seats (including the two by the window on each side which were much nicer and also vacant) and told that they could. We paid they did not they got better seats than we did. As we were taking off the air hostess told me to put my seat to the upright position I was surprised because I had not put it back. A few minutes later she told me the same thing. That’s when I realized the back of my seat was broken. The man behind me was unhappy with this and spent the entire flight pushing on my back in an effort to keep my seat more upright. It would stay for a while and then a passenger would walk past and push on the back of my seat for stability and back it would go. The man would push me forward someone else would push me back - this went on for 9 hours. One of the bathrooms went out of order (the bathrooms beside my seat). The staff did not put an out of order sign on the door. They knew it was out of order because I told them. People kept lining up. I would tell them it was out of order. They would walk to the other bathroom on the aisle in front of me. I would pull my feet up to let them pass - one more strike against my “comfort” seat. The man next to me was trying to work - every time someone walked past they hit his computer. He was very tall and got tripped over and bumped through the entire flight. The other bathroom at the front of the plane was put out of order. They ran out of toilet paper. I chose to avoid drinking for 9 hours so I could avoid the bathrooms. The plane was so old and decrepit. I fly several times a year for both business and pleasure. This was easily the worse flight I have ever been on.

We flew in business class from JFK to FCO on 12/17/2014 and back on Delta on 12/27/14. The AZ airplane was a new Airbus 330 clean and well maintained. The boarding went smooth. The flight left on time and actually arrived to destination earlier. We were impressed by the on-board service. Staff were very professional and friendly. The food was excellent. The seats were very comfortable and the inflight entertainment was very good. Definitely the Alitalia flight was way superior to the Delta' which utilized an old B 767 with seats not quite comfortable and mediocre entertainment. This is not the Alitalia that I remember from 15 years ago. I will fly AZ again.

LHR-FCO on AZ201 and FCO-LHR on AZ208. There are no AZ staff at LHR T4 it is outsourced to a different company. Checking in with the machines was not easy - the touch screens are unresponsive and take too much time. Boarding pass is printed on a pathetic paper. As we had bags to drop off we had to queue in the bag drop off line which was huge. Only 2 people were serving the counter for the flight. Cabin crew don't care about actually providing service. As we walked onto the plane they were simply talking amongst themselves. LHR-FCO was uneventful but then again I did sleep the entire time. Old A320. No IFE. Poor interior. Had to wait ages in the bus at FCO to be taken to the terminal. FCO-LHR delayed 20 mins no reason given. Again flight uneventful. No IFE.

Athens to Rome and Rome to Amsterdam. Nightmare. 1 Hour delay from Athens landed at Naples instead of Rome. Arrived at Rome 3 hours late waiting plus one hour in the aircraft for the stairs. Next flight the next day also delayed 2 hours to depart Nobody willing to inform us about what was going on no food at all. Rude crew.

### Alitalia customer review
Cabin crew stood chatting and ignored passengers as they boarded. After snack was served the cabin crew disappeared. Crew never smiled or talked nicely to passengers once throughout the flight. Crew looked unkempt and not smartly dressed. Very unprofessional crew on the 4 flights I used. Terrible service. Announcements were inaudible and cut off mid sentence and pilot announcements could not be understood at all.

### Alitalia customer review
Given the quality and variety of Italian food beer and wine and Italian hospitality in general its surprising that the Italian 'National Carrier' steadfastly refuses to showcase anything positive about its home and culture. On any airline the quality of the crew is all important. I have persevered with Alitalia but no more. Crew do not assist with the boarding process hence it takes far too long to get passengers seated and flights are often delayed as a result. Once onboard service will not commence for 30 mins after departure. Nothing is available for sale (another opportunity missed). If Alitalia is to survive all of this needs to changed.

KL3401/AZ0107 (AMS-FCO): I bought the ticket via KLM website as they are both members of Skyteam. The aircraft was an A320 which looks ageing on the seats and cabin layout. Service was very basic with the selection of salty snack or sweet snack and the choices of drinks were very little (arancia rossa/orange juice hot tea hot coffee or water/sparkling water). Crew were not very welcoming and seemed not to enjoy their job I also did notice that the crew did not pay attention carefully to passengers who have not opened the windows shades and fastened the seat belt before landing. In a sum Alitalia is not up to standard of premium airlines that they claim to be. Many rooms for improvements in order to compete with other regional airlines. On the bright side the landing was very smooth and we arrived earlier as expected arrival time.

We will not fly Alitalia again. Our flight last week from Rome to Toronto was a nightmare. There was no in-flight entertainment or outlets for charging — on our 9 hour + 3 hour (on the ground while we were stuck on the runway due to "safety checks") flight. The seats were dirty my husband's tray table was filthy and sticky. I have a nut allergy and the snacks that were distributed all contained traces of nuts. Not a good experience at all.

### Alitalia customer review
Reservation through Delta - 2 flights on Alitalia Cairo to Rome and Rome to JFK. After I read reviews here I was ready for bad experience. I don't believe it is the same airline described here by other reviewers. Everything was perfect except the idea that you can't select your own seat ahead of travel. The service on both flights were excellent planes were on time. Food was great. Also lounge in Rome was nice and hospitable. I guess may be my luck but I would fly Alitalia again.

### Alitalia customer review
Two domestic flights in the last half year. Two really bad experiences. First one in April 2014 Trieste-Naples- Trieste. Outbound flight cancelled due to the strike after several long phone calls Alitalia managed to put us on a flight to Rome. And that was their only choice. We had to find our own way to get to Naples at our own expense. The second one in October 2014 Venice-Catania-Venice supposed to be operated by Air One but later cancelled. We were informed by an e-mail about flight cancellation and it was necessary to call their call centre to be transferred to other flight (via FCO). Flight on the 24th of October form VCE to FCO delayed. Since there were lots of passengers for Catania and the fact that the next flight from FCO to Catania was full one would expect that Alitalia will wait for us – but no the flight departed a few minutes earlier. Were transferred to the last flight which was again delayed severely. Finally landed after midnight. Cabin crew on all the flights with couldn't-care-less attitude to customers with one exception FCO to VCE AZ1483 2nd November operated by Alitalia CitiLiner – professional and really nice everything done with a smile. But nevertheless never again with Alitalia there are now lots and way better possibilities to fly on domestic flights in Italy.

### Alitalia customer review
Brussels-Rome-Athens Return. Staff were extremely rude even when both flights were delayed by more than 3 hours (also on the return). Very old planes and dirty (on both flights) and you get no food nor have the option to buy food. So we travelled hours without having the possibility to eat. You only get one coffee (half full) which is btw disgusting and you cannot ask for a refill. Would rather pay 200 euros more to go with another airline and even pay more and choosing Ryanair before them.

### Alitalia customer review
Round-trip JFK to Rome on 10/5/2014 and we returned on 10/17/2014. Our flights were AZ 0603 and AZ 0610. On both flights the two bathrooms closest to us stopped working (did not flush!) shortly after takeoff. I am unsure of the remaining bathrooms - but half of the aircraft stunk all the way! They never locked the non-working facilities and never directed the travelers so people kept using those defunct bathrooms. It is inexcusable and apparently not a single event as it happened on both legs of the trip.

### Alitalia customer review
Flying MXP-NRT and back in Oct-Nov 2014. Window single seat is excellent and full lie-flat. Entertainment system is OK but could be better. The food is better than business class average but I'm expecting a better wine selection when flying an Italian airline. During the flight flight attendants almost disappear just leaving some cheap self-service drinks and snacks (to be improved). Well the overall impression is that the crew doesn't look so motivated and willing to assist and please passengers. The atmosphere is a little "sad" compared to other business classes of competitors.

### Alitalia customer review
October 10th from Rome to Toronto. We did not choose to fly this airline as we had bought tickets from British Airways however due to flight delays British Airways arranged for us to fly on Alitalia for the first leg of our trip. We were told incorrect information regarding seat availability and flight details from the Alitalia representative upon check-in and boarding the plane was a largely unorganized process which took well over one hour to complete. The plane was older (tube televisions down the center of the plane instead of seat-back screens) the cleanliness of the seats was sub-par and the sink in the toilet was clogged for the duration of the trip. For the first half of the flight the service on board was mediocre but acceptable however once dinner was served the service became non-existent. For 4 to 5 hours (on a 9 hour flight) the flight attendants hung out at the back of the plane and were deliberately ignoring the call button. If any passengers wanted a drink they were required to walk to the back of the plane and pour it themselves all while the flight attendants sat around talking and completely ignoring anything outside of their conversation. This expectation of self service is very inconvenient when someone with anything but an aisle seat would like a glass of water. I also wondered what passengers who require mobility assistance do in this situation? Flight attendants ignoring their passengers for half of an international flight is completely unacceptable. I will not be flying Alitalia in future.

### Alitalia customer review
London to Tel Aviv via Rome. The service was very bad throughout the flight and the main part of the meal provided consisted of cold turkey slices. There were screens on every seat but none of them worked. I wouldn't recommend Alitalia to anyone unless they change the quality of the flight experience.

### Alitalia customer review
I flew out on flight AZ651 Toronto to Rome on September 4 2014 and returned on flight AZ650 from Rome to Toronto Sept 21 2014. If I were to say how disgusting these flights were it would be an understatement! Both aircraft were filthy and old - the seats were stained and broken as well as the trays. The TVs were older then the films they actually showed that's if you were even able to actually see the screens! As for the crew they all looked like they were sucking on sour lemons not a single crew member cracked a smile on both flights. I have never seen an aircraft where they put up curtains so that the crew can rest. I am pretty easy going but these flights were unacceptable. There is no excuse for any of these issues Alitalia should be ashamed of what the passengers on these flights experienced.

Rome Fiumicino to Milan Malpensa on Sept 22nd. Alitalia operates few flights on Milan main airport but Rome is a route with 3 daily flights. I took the evening flight back home and it was on time and ok. No entertainment but it was a 55 min flight. A small drink and very small snack offered.

### Alitalia customer review
I really wanted to like Alitalia as my husband and I had an amazing time in Italy and had great experiences with all the people we met there. However the service on our flight was horrendous. Firstly our plane had to be about 20 years old. There were large tube TVs that came down from the ceiling including one who's picture was always green and another who's rolling screen made it impossible to watch. This I can forgive as I know not to expect TVs on every seat on every international flight. What I can't forgive is the deplorable service onboard. No smiling no eye contact no please no thank you no your welcome. Nothing. They served a meal and one round of drinks. They only served half the plane coffee/tea then for some reason stopped. They stated drinks and snacks would be available for the duration of the flight. After the meal service we saw no one for a very long time we pressed the call button for a drink and no one came. Finally we saw a flight attendant walking by and she said we had to go to the back of the plane for drinks. So we walked to the back of the plane where it was passenger self service. Passengers poured their own drinks while the flight attendants sat two feet away putting on makeup and chatting. I asked for a snack one pointed to the top shelf. No trash was retrieved between dinner service and maybe 30 minutes before landing. The only positive is that we landed where we intended which I know is the most important part but when you are paying thousands of dollars on tickets you expect more. We will never fly this airline again and will share our experience to deter anyone we know from choosing it as well.

Flew Naples to London RT. Will never use this airline again. Disorganized check-in. Not particularly clean plane. Terrible seats which were even worse than the usual bad airline seats.

### Alitalia customer review
We were on flight AZ350 from Rome to Toronto Sept 21st. The plane should have been condemned it was so old there was filth on the seats the material was split. There were only 2 ceiling TV's that worked so 80% of the passengers are not able to see anything. The food was horrible and the flight attendants decided to take a 5 hour break after serving the meal. People were told to help themselves the washrooms were awful unfortunately with a 9.5 hour flight most people had to use them at sometime. I will never fly with Alitalia again. Our flights from Toronto to Italy were on Air France and they were excellent.

### Alitalia customer review
Just returned from Rome to Toronto. Never again! We have travelled extensively on many different airlines and this is the worst I have seen. The aircraft was old and dated. A few old video screens spread so far apart that most couldn't see - that's if you wanted to watch Spider Man 2. This was a 9.5 hour flight and we were served a tiny dried up pasta dish and a glass of house wine - not individual bottles like most have. The next service was 7 hours later a tiny dry muffin and the same little bag of crackers we had at dinner - no water service throughout the flight. The aircraft smelt and the wash rooms filthy. The guys next to me had a table tray that was cracked in two and his seat was in a permanent recline position. Couldn't check in online so had to bear the mobs and check in at the counter!

### Alitalia customer review
AZ703 2 Sep IST-FCO C Class connecting onto AZ C class to JFK. This is my 4th USA-Istanbul business class trip on AZ this year - and my last. On checking in told the reserved and multiple times confirmed seats requested were not assigned to me. Agent has no idea why and cannot recover them. No greeting on boarding C cabin is full. Immediately after take-off the flight attendant (term used politely) closes the forward curtain and sits down. After an hour of no service - and no one even walking into the cabin - I begin ringing the call button to ask for a coffee (flight departs 06.15 hrs). Rung at least 8 times finally a coach attendant comes forward to ask why I am ringing the button so much. When I ask for a simple cup of coffee the forward attendant says everyone is asleep why did I have to awaken them? When told I had been ringing for service she shrugs and says she never heard the bell. Throws half a cup at me and says she has to now prepare for landing. Many of our complaints on here are petty but hopefully some airline execs read these comments. In this case a lazy and rude flight attendant coupled with a begrudgingly served half cup of tepid coffee has cost AZ the potential for my returning and for AZ to get some pretty decent revenue.

### Alitalia customer review
I am a business traveler and I have seen the industry change over the years. I no longer expect outstanding service and all that goes with it. My expectations have been 'right-sized' over the years. But my last two flights on Alitalia will be my last two flights on Alitalia. Not only was the service awful but the plane hadn't seen proper cleaning and service since the 90s. I flew the same aircraft 4 days apart and the lav didn't work coming or going. I cannot understand how it is possible. I chose the flight ONLY because it was direct from Rome to Chicago but I would prefer to spend the extra time changing planes somewhere just to avoid this awful airline. And as a side note I returned on Saturday and today is Monday. I am still waiting for my luggage.

### Alitalia customer review
We'd never fly Alitalia again. We're thankful we landed safely on our return Toronto/Rome flights but our traveling family of 6 were extremely uncomfortable on the flights. Despite paying top dollar for economy tickets and being assured we'd be seated together we were all spread out. The three in the back didn't get food: they ran out by the time they got to the rear of the plane! The bathrooms were filthy / disgusting and didn't have paper. You could smell them throughout the flight. Some seats were held together by duct tape. Like to watch a movie during an 8 hour flight? Forget it on Alitalia they have a few old drop-down screens so bring your own movie-watching device with lots of power (they don't offer plug-ins). If you want water or anything else during an 8 hour flight you're unlikely to get it on Alitalia. We had no service for 7 of the 8 hours on our return flight. I'm a very frequent flyer and this was the worst quality and service ever encountered on an airline.

### Alitalia customer review
FCO-BUD-FCO both flights delayed about 20 min. in Rome for heavy traffic and this is not an Alitalia's fault on the return from Budapest 30 min. for some "uncommon" luggage boarding procedures but we ended up landing in Rome only 15 min. past the scheduled arrive. Cabin crew professional and polite. Will fly Alitalia again.

### Alitalia customer review
I've being flying Alitalia for the last few years back and forth between Milan Linate and Sardinia (Cagliari or Alghero). In four years (and 80+ flights) it occurred only once that my flight was 1-hour delayed. Planes used by Alitalia for my short route were usually Airbus A319/A320 with spacious seats and entertainment system (only radio). I never had problems with the luggage (1 hand-luggage and 1 32kg check-in bag is included in the price). Personnel was always nice to me. Some things can still be improved but I think Alitalia is still the best that Italy can offer.

Flew with Alitalia last month from Rome to Thessaloniki and then Thessaloniki to London via Rome. 1st flight my husband and I were told that only one of us could get on the flight because they were 'overbooked'. On the way back flight was delay 90mins only to find out that our luggage was delayed and still in Rome. It has now been 14 days. I will refuse to fly with Alitalia. I would rather pay extra money to ensure these things don't happen.

### Alitalia customer review
My husband and I were scheduled to leave July 31 aboard Flight 621 headed for Rome. Plane was set to take off at 4.30 pm. It was late we taxied out on the runway and then stopped. It took the pilot 2 hours to tell us that we had mechanical difficulties. At 8 pm we were told that the plane could not take off. We were herded off the plane told to reclaim our luggage and told we would be put up at a hotel. Ushered to the sidewalk outside Bradley International Terminal to await a bus. For 90 minutes we were shuttled back and forth from one side of the sidewalk to the other. The Alitalia representatives were useless. We finally got on a bus to a Marriott Hotel we got there at 9.45 pm only to be told that there was no room at the inn and we now had to go to another Marriot. At 11 pm we arrived at the next hotel. The bus picked us up the next morning for our reschedule 11 am flight which of course was late. The plane was straightened out but the food sitting in their kitchen overnight was congealed. The crew were indifferent. We arrived in Rome at 8.15 am local time. Now if you have a plane-load of people delayed by almost a day many of whom have connecting flights wouldn't you think the airline would have spent some time going through the passenger list to make sure they would be rebooked onto other flights? We got off the plane only to find out that we had to reclaim our luggage once again. We were escorted to the ticket counter and left to fend for ourselves. It took us hours to book our connecting flight to Istanbul. As we made our way through the airport which by the way has no people movers or luggage carts we kept running into fellow passengers. Absolutely no help from Alitalia. We boarded a bus that would take us to our plane it was easily in the 90s outside and the bus had the heat blasting. No one from Alitalia noticed. Our flight was delayed. Of course.

### Alitalia customer review
JFK-FCO / FCO-TUN. TUN-FCO / FCO-YYZ. Delays of around 1.5 hrs deemed normal (had to run to catch the next flight). Crew rude to a point you think twice to ask them. Assigned separate seats so had to travel away from my wife. Fellow passengers had to do musical chairs to seat families together. Lost luggage on the two legs of the flights and no updates yet. Airplane dirty no entertainment. Catering is so dismal so we were hungry and with delays left hungry for about 24 hours. Bottom line avoid Alitalia pay extra pick extra layover but avoid it.

In the last month I flew two round-trip MXP-JFK-YQB with Alitalia (MXP-JFK) and Delta (JFK-YQB). All AZ flights on time new A330 in good conditions crews sometimes excellent and sometimes not so friendly. Food in economy class is not a pleasure IFE good as usual on A330. I think that AZ offers a good service on this route at reasonable price.

### Alitalia customer review
Had not flown Alitalia in years and was curious whether they had improved anything. JFK to Rome. I was not able to get a pre-assigned seat on the old and clunky web site. At the gate a bitchy attendant didn't let me on with my carry-on and forced me to check-in my business trolley. Plane was not full and there was plenty of room on overhead storage. Flight attendants quite unresponsive to extra drink/coffee requests. Seemed bothered by passengers asking more than bare minimum. In Rome waited well over an hour to get my luggage.

Traveled this month on Alitalia Magnifica Class from Los Angeles to Rome. Flat bed seats were reasonably comfortable and due to cabin angle felt a bit more spacious but wear and tear was obvious and unappealing. Inflight entertainment system was not touch screen and was out dated not intuitive with poor picture quality. Bathrooms and overall cabin were out dated and need to be upgraded. Food was actually very good but service was unremarkable.

YYZ-FCO on J class. A332 old and tired aircraft with old Biz class seats configuration. No lie flat bed however I managed to get 5+ hrs of sleep. IFE just okay very low quality old removable screens provided by cabin crew. Flight attendants were great all smiles and attentive throughout the flight. Dinner was served in style it was one of the best meals I have ever experienced in an airplane many food selections plenty of drinks desserts fruits in the morning the breakfast was very good as well. It was just bad lack to have flown the old 332 as the newer aircraft's have got such a better configuration and much more comfortable seats. Overall a good experience again.

### Alitalia customer review
For 10 years I avoided Alitalia but then visiting Italy for holidays I thought we may give it another try. So travelled from Florence to Bucharest via Rome on 31 July 2014. It is a 1.5hr flight that was delayed by about 30-45 minutes but there was no acknowledgement or announcement of the delay. Transiting through Rome itself is a case study in how not to organise an airport for transit and boarding the flight was a nightmare. No priority for families or business no possibility to upgrade to business with miles from the alliance even though the business class was completely empty (meaning not one seat was taken). On the flight itself food was very poor and the cabin staff just disappeared. There were no sick bags in the seats and the staff did not answer the call button at all - too busy chatting in the empty business class - and then spent 10 minutes looking for sick bags. Also no announcement for landing or beginning of landing. In fact no pilot communication whatsoever after taking off. And as we got to our destination in Bucharest our checked in bag was lost and apparently many other people on the flight who transited via Rome had the same problem so long queue at the Claim section. Not willing to waste my time and money on this airline again.

### Alitalia customer review
I flew with my wife from Thessaloniki to Rome and back. Both flights were delayed. Plane could be cleaner. As it is an international flight almost 2 hours the only thing you get is a drink and a small bag of biscuits. The coffee is awful. The staff could be more polite. The worst impression was on the return flight. We had only one suitcase which weighed 25 kg. Staff told us that we had to take 2 kg out because only 23kg was allowed. When we told her that we were 2 people but had only one suitcase much less than allowed (23x2 = 46kg) she insisted that we should take 2 kg out of the suitcase. So we had to open our suitcase at the airport. We will never choose this airline again.

### Alitalia customer review
Alitalia check in at Heathrow were superb but after that the whole experience was the worst we've ever experienced on a long haul flight. Staff in Rome airport were rude during our delayed connecting flight and when we eventually got onto the plane to Buenos Aires we all sat waiting in our seats for over an hour for the flight to commence no refreshments boiling hot and no explanation to what the delay was. Staff were indifferent to the passengers requests that's when they could be bothered to work. Finally the inflight entertainment to help us forget this nightmare was a disaster in as much the screen would randomly switch off during movies. Avoid at all costs until Etihad take over.

Only 3 out of 6 restrooms were in working order and those were filthy. Not cheap tickets so I expect much more. Heard lots of complaints from the passengers so we weren't the only ones who were very disappointed.

The check-in staff also goes beyond the call of duty. Highly recommended.

### Alitalia customer review
Milan to JFK/New York. The smoothest flight in recent memory (and I am a frequent traveler). There was no turbulence and a perfect landing. Inflight entertainment had a nice assortment of movies and games. There has been much said online about airport staff and flight staff for this airline not being ideal. As for airport staff not sure if their demeanour is 100% their fault. Check in was not clearly explained in Milan. There was a line for "baggage drop of" and "economy check in" as well as kiosks. This makes for grumpy passengers. As for flight attendants the ones on my flight were businesslike and polite. They were not rude or happy. It was fine with me.

### Alitalia customer review
It pains me not to give Alitalia a high mark. Their inflight experience in Business Class is impressive. But it's everything leading up to the flight that is a disaster. Their website is outdated and nearly impossible to use. Their call center is a joke with incompetent agents who read off a script. And Alitalia will change flight times on a whim and penalize the traveler financially. In our experience after paying over $8000 for a ticket they charged an additional $850 for change fee and $1500 for fare difference when I asked for an earlier flight after they changed flight times from the original booking and shortened my connection time in Rome. They also changed my booking from Business to Economy and I had to make innumerable calls to their idiotic call center to try and resolve it. Once in the air the service was lovely from a friendly sharp-looking crew. The food is a showcase of the best of Italy with delicious pastas and breads served course-by-course. I don't drink but the wine list was extensive. They provide a high-end Ferragamo amenity kit. And the seats are lie-flat and great for a long sleep. The only drawback from the inflight experience is a poor IFE system with limited options and a dirty Business Class bathroom. If Alitalia can get their act together on the ground they can become a well-rounded and competitive airline. But until then despite a great inflight product I will avoid them.

AZ703 IST-FCO connecting onto AZ 630 FCO-MIA Business Class/29 June. On boarding in IST the forward attendant was busy in the galley on her cellphone with no greeting or attention to the boarding. Her service was minimal and after the light breakfast she brought a pass-riding co-worker to the jumpseat and closed the curtain where she remained for the rest of the 2 hour flight. FCO-MIA was the exact opposite. The purser (and the entire Magnifica Class crew) was/were attentive cordial available willing to help and grateful for passengers choosing AZ. On approaching MIA the purser came to my seat acknowledged my frequent flyer status (DL) and offered enrolment into the AZ program. I really like AZ when a crew is good; the problem is the inconsistency of AZ crews! They also tend it seems to focus more on co-workers than revenue passengers.

Flew from Rome to Tokyo. We were told that we could not sit together due to the plane having only 4 seats left (wrong). We were told we could sit together if we paid 85 Euros for a "Comfort Seat" so we paid it. We sat together ok but the seat was just a standard seat and an uncomfortable one at that. I was told all sorts of lies by the cabin staff who tried to get my receipt off me presumably so I had no proof I had been ripped off. We will never fly again with Alitalia!

Flew from Rome to Lamezia Terme and back. A modern airbus. The interior was immaculate. The staff were very smart in appearance. They were courteous and attentive. The flight was only one hour but we were served a red orange or peach juice and snacks. All were good. The flight itself was smooth and the announcements clear and helpful including from the captain. Alitalia is a good airline and I would not hesitate to fly with the airline again. There's an air of sophistication and smartness that you rarely find with other airlines.

### Alitalia customer review
My parents and I were returning from a lovely vacation in Italy to Toronto on June 1st 2014 when we discovered our flight AZ650 from Rome was delayed over 3 hours. We were not offered any advice or meals and only found out from talking with other passengers that we could get a meal provided to us for our long wait. We were not allowed to choose the food we felt like but were limited to very limited selection of very bland overcooked pasta. When we finally got on the plane we were shocked at its condition and that it felt very uncomfortable. The upholstery was all worn the seats were cramped and my mothers seat even had her arm rest duct taped! When the television screens came down (unfortunately not on the backs of seats) our screen was flickering and full of static so we could not see the safety video at all. When the movies came on we discovered that both my mothers seat and my seat did not have working sound systems so we could not hear any movies. The screen continued to flicker so much that not only could we not hear the movie but we could even see the movie. A flight attendant came and folded the screen back up and said it was not working. For 10 hours my parents and I were crammed in a middle seat row with no sound or movies to watch. This was unacceptable. Our row of seats was in the middle (unfortunately) and had bathroom doors at either side so we continually heard the slamming of doors. The food was awful so surprising from an Italian airline. Our seats were also the most cramped I have experienced and I am a small person. It was a disappointing end to our vacation.

### Alitalia customer review
Linate - Trieste LIN-TRS. Now this flight is handled by Air Mistral basically the Italian Post Office airline that during the day carries passengers and switches to mail cargo in the night hours. Not kidding. And you pay full fare. The plane is a ATR 72 if you get it in the morning still smells from the night activity. Seats incredibly uncomfortable and small no hand luggage allowed unless very small and therefore you have to wait your trolley back beside the plane (even under the rain). Horrible unacceptable below any civilized standards.

June 15 ORD-FCO was scheduled to take off at 8.40 pm. At around 8.30 it was announced flight was delayed then announced that it was mechanical issues. At around 11pm people were told to go pick up their luggage (which was never loaded onto plane) and those passengers who lived in Chicago were told to go home the rest of us were told to go to Alitalia check in where we would be given a hotel room for the night. The process of getting a room and getting to the hotel took 2 hours. People in wheelchairs and families with small kids were standing waiting for shuttle buses to their hotels. We were told to return to airport at 10am next day to check in for a flight to depart at 2pm. One look at the line told me that 2pm was fantasy it actually took off around 4pm. We stood in line for 4 hours to get seats sorted. The plane we flew on was old grubby no entertainment and terrible food. During the 4 hours waiting on Monday passengers were given no information from Alitalia no refreshments were offered no consideration given to those traveling with babies or elderly.

LHR-FCO-TLV-FCO-LCY - This airline is worse than any European Budget Airline. 3 out of 4 of the flights were delayed and no one seemed to care. If you are above 175cm doing not fly with this airline otherwise your knees will be pressed against the seat in front of you. Make sure you have a meal before you get on the flight as the food is limited to a very small packet of dried snacks. All of the aircraft's are very old and do not have any screens showing you the flight information. Also do not transfer at FCO unless you have more than 3 hours between flights as the additional security checks are chaotic. Terrible experience.

My wife and I booked this as a Delta flight but had to completely recheck in when changing planes in Chicago. They re-assigned our confirmed seats in row 18 to separate middle seats in rows 36 and 48 in the back of the airplane. We were told that Delta confirmed seats meant nothing. After much fuss we were finally given seats together in the middle section of row 48 (next to last row). My seat had no cushioning at all it was like sitting on the metal frame. The people in front of us promptly shoved their seats all the way back into our faces for the whole trip. But worse was the urine smell in our area which was apparently from a window seat in the row ahead of us all they did was spray the seats and areas with a lemon scent which quickly dissipated. This airline is now at the bottom of my list as the worst international carrier I have ever flown and will never fly again.

London City to Rome and back to London Heathrow. We got to and from Italy safely the crews were friendly but don't expect anything other than a tiny packet of breadsticks and a juice water coke or wine on the flights. Rome airport is the worst I have experienced as it is disorganised and crowded. All in all nothing special but they got us to our destination relatively comfortably.

### Alitalia customer review
Abu Dhabi to Malaga on 13th/June. I was shocked with their onboard service. The first flight was 6.5 hours from Abu Dhabi to Rome. They only served a single drink and breakfast. In fact they should have also served a meal. The second flight from Rome to Malaga. The flight is 2.45 hours. I was shocked. they only served a drink and a packet of Pretzels. We were all waiting for a meal. Nothing came. Alitalia is worse than a budget airline. Never again.

FCO-GRU-FCO 15/2 - 8/3. This was second time I took this flight. Very cheap and comfortable no delays. Good food and crew. Nothing to complain about. These flights especially to GRU or GIG (Rio) are always full.

Flight was from Amsterdam to Rio de Janeiro with a transit in Rome. Before that I have a connection by KLM. There are several transfer counters in Rome airport but all pointing me to the other for the boarding pass. I thought any transfer counter can issue the boarding pass? When I purchased the ticket back in November 2013 I personally called the Italian call centre to request my special meal on board. I did this on all other legs of my trip on other airlines. However during the flight my special meal was not available and not booked. The cabin crew did not even try to solve the problem. On my other legs on other airlines I did get my requests. This shows that Alitalia is terrible with customer service and also inflight services.

### Alitalia customer review
Just landed at FCO from LAX. Worst long haul flight I've ever had. Upgrade to premium economy. Promised great seats and better food by the agent. $3.200 round trip ticket a total waste of money for 5 of us. Told 120 degree reclining seat - just read the fine print 'up to 120 degree' reclining seat was closer to 90 degrees! Five of us had seats together then reassigned at check in. Terrible in flight movie selection. Trash all over the plane. So disappointed and now have to fly home in 2 weeks. Nothing good about the flight.

### Alitalia customer review
Flew from Toronto-Rome-Tel Aviv on May 3 and returned on June 3. I was flabbergasted that Alitalia uses such old planes. There was no in-flight entertainment system on the transatlantic flight (both ways). From the comments on here and speaking with American friends who fly the airline often it doesn't seem to be case with U.S. routes (they use newer planes) so Canadian customers be aware that you will get shafted. I echo the sentiment on here: why bother and offer headphones for such clunky equipment? I will say that the flights left on time and arrived on time (minimal delays) and my luggage was waiting for me which is always a nice feeling. The food was just adequate. From Toronto-Rome they served for breakfast a puny Danish and Oreo cookies. My luggage was 3-5 lbs overweight and they said nothing so I appreciated that. Service was fine and flight attendants were pleasant enough but I think in this day and age not having an in-flight entertainment system for 8-9 hour flight is just unacceptable especially when pretty much every major European airline offers it. I will only fly Alitalia again if they have an amazing sale. Otherwise there are better options out there.

ORD-FCO-IST in Economy on May 22-23 2014. The plane from Chicago to Rome -- an airbus A320-200 - smelt the upholstery was stained seats were not equipped with individual screens. And then there were the Alitalia flight attendants - a dour group that couldn't be bothered to smile and were practically taken aback by requests for things like water. I will never again complain about my usual carrier Delta.

### Alitalia customer review
On May 12 2014 our flight from ORD to FCO was cancelled for weather related reasons. After 7 hours in the terminal we were told to go to a hotel or go home and come back for a 13.00 departure on May 13. We were told by the gate crew we would be reimbursed for cab fare or hotel fare and then had to go down and wait for our bags and then go through the whole check-in procedure the next day. Alitalia denied our request for reimbursement. While I understand weather is unavoidable I can't accept being lied to and shabby treatment. I think Alitalia could have handled this better especially since we had a 9.5 hour flight ahead of us with very little sleep. To add insult to injury there was a ground delay at ORD the next day which kept us on the tarmac for 2.5 hours after leaving the gate. By the way the seats were extremely uncomfortable.

### Alitalia customer review
This was my first flight with an international carrier and I was unimpressed to say the least. I flew round trip from New York to Rome in economy class. The cabin was extremely cramped and the plane was old. On the way to Rome I was assigned a different seat from the one I originally chose when I booked months in advance. I am a small person but there was still very little leg room. My return trip from Rome was worse. Check-in took forever and the airport staff was rude. Upon checking in the agent at the counter told me he couldn't give me a seat assignment "at this time" and I would have to get my seat assignment at the gate that is unless I wanted to pay an additional 70 euro for a "comfort seat" on an exit row. Again I had already selected a seat months in advance. The food and cabin service were adequate and both flights were on-time. Other than that it was an unpleasant experience. I will choose a different carrier in the future.

London to Bari return via Linate. Perfect trip. Pleasant ground and cabin staff all flights arrived ahead of schedule all planes A320s clean and smart. Luggage arrived without problems if slightly slow as is usual at Heathrow.

Milan - Vienna and return. Both flights departed and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule planes looked new well maintained and clean. Cabin crew was caring and charming even if the flight to Vienna was full. The ticket was really cheap though I bought it two months prior of departure. Almost unbelievably the luggage in Milan Linate was delivered only 10 minutes after landing. If this turns out to be the new standard of Alitalia they will become my first choice.

### Alitalia customer review
JFK to Milan return in April 2014. Plane was new seat comfortable and entertainment system was varied included movies TV shows music games. Kept my nine year old entertained for the entire flight each way. Cabin crew was very attentive and came around often. The only minor complaint I have is the food was mediocre but all in all it was an enjoyable flight.

### Alitalia customer review
Budget price and you get what you pay for. Toronto-Rome return 20+ year old A330 15 inch ceiling mounted TVs that do not work - neither does the audio system. I don't understand why they bother to provide headphones! Decent leg room but seats that recline in your face so it is hard to use a laptop on the seatback table - needless to say there are no power outlets WiFi etc. Food & beverages were okay and promptly served - thereafter the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen for the duration of the 10 hour flight. Water etc was self service from the galley. Despite a 45 minute delay on departure the flight arrived on time. Before flying Alitalia long haul find out what plane they are using on that route. They advertise their new fleet but be warned they are still flying ancient and well worn aircraft on transatlantic routes and the cabin service is risible.

### Alitalia customer review
Rome to Tel Aviv return. Both flights on time planes well maintained and clean. Cabin crew was perfect even if the flights were full (especially on the way back) they managed the situation perfectly helping passengers to locate their hand luggage in the overhead lockers providing food service quickly. After they served the main course walking around the cabin asking if we need anything else. The only fault I noticed is the chaotic boarding process.

We flew Toronto to Rome and returned Rome to Toronto in May 2014. The service was just fine attendants were very helpful and polite. Food was better than we thought it would be. We would fly with them again.

### Alitalia customer review
Flew Alitalia on 5/13/14 from Chicago to Rome to Tel Aviv then back on 5/21/14 from Tel Aviv to Rome to JFK. I had low expectations due to some reviews but I would definitely fly them again. Prefer the 777 that we came back on over the Airbus 330 that we went over on but both were comfortable even in coach. Food and drink service were great. Weather thwarted the flight out of Chicago the evening of 5/12 necessitating an overnight stay and Alitalia provided food vouchers while we tried to out-wait the weather and then claim forms for the overnight stay in a hotel and taxi expenses. All agents and flight attendants were gracious and helpful.

### Alitalia customer review
I recently flew Alitalia return BOS-FCO then back. Our flights went without a hitch. On time and great service. Some people complain about the crew disappearing. I did not find that to be the case. It was an overnight flight so we had lights off during take off and then when we got to what I would guess is cruising altitude they served wine and dinner. It is airplane food not great but I don't care about the food on a plane. I was awake for the entire flight. Unfortunately my seat did not recline and the one in front me was broken in the down position. So that was not great. But all through the flight the attendants passed out cold water and asked the people awake if they needed anything. Not everyone speaks English not a big deal. They did not lose any of our luggage. Flight home was the same but no broken seat! Five us flew together and they honored all our assigned seats.

Trip Scheduled from Hartsfield Atlanta on Delta 1873 to Miami FL with connecting flight on Alitalia 631 or 6371. Flight delayed in Atlanta because of bad weather in Miami on Saturday May 3 2014 in Miami for one hour. Could not print boarding passes in ATL for the connection flight. Arrived at gate late in Miami and through no fault of the passengers that were travelling together our seats were given away and we had to take the extreme last two seats in the plane. The people that were occupying the seats that we paid for should have been moved since they were obviously last minute booking when we arrived at the gate and not us. It was a very horrible flight even after making the gate in spite of the bad weather.

Flight from Tokyo to Milan (MXP) May 4th 2014. 3 hours delay no compensation at all about lost trains and connections except about 7 euro for lunch at airport. With that delay we lost two trains (already paid) and I had to rent a car for the trip from Malpensa Airport to the city where I live (about 300 km).

### Alitalia customer review
April 2014 Naples to Rome (NAP-FCO). Rome to New York (FCO-JFK). Baggage check in seemed as if it would be easy at Naples which is a smaller airport. I was checking in 2 bags for work equipment. The baggage agent generated my boarding pass and baggage ticket stickered my luggage took it and told me I had to go to another counter to pay for the extra baggage. Then I had to go back to the original baggage check-in counter for my already printed boarding passes and baggage claim ticket stubs. Security was routine and a short line at 10am on a weekday. There were no power outlets at all in the gate area or just above it near the more comfortable couches. The first flight was routine. Economy row 8C. I think it was a 737. Upon arriving in Rome we deplaned and took the bus to terminal. I had to change terminals which according to the sign would be a 12 minute walk to Terminal G. What the sign did not say was after 2 minutes would be a passport control line which was 5 minutes. After that was the walk and a train shuttle ride to Terminal G for flight to NYC. The boarding was the cattle call I had read about. The plane was a 777-200ER. Ticket = Class Y/Economy. Seat row 27D center section of 4 seats. My concerns were warranted: No USB power jacks at the seats. Once on the plane and stowing my personal items the plane grew uncomfortably hot as we were on it for over an hour without proper air conditioning. We left 30 minutes late. An hour after takeoff the drink cart came through. 80 minutes into flight I received my vegetarian special diet meal for lunch which was vegetable Jalfrezi a cold lentil salad a tiny fruit salad and a breadroll. All adequate. After meal service at 2 hours after takeoff the fasten seat belt sign was finally turned off even though no bad weather. After meal service and coffee offering the FA's mostly disappeared to the back of the plane behind the curtain. FA's were professional and pleasant. I did not use the IFE at all. Self-service Water soda and breadstick snacks were available in galley area. Yes as others mentioned the IFE restricts legroom in many seats.

I flew Magnifica (Business) Class from Rome to JFK on March 15 2014. The service and the food were excellent - one of the best in the industry. The planes were clean and new. The Alitalia Lounges at FCO however leave much to be desired. I go out of my way to fly Alitalia.

Flew non-stop Boston to FCO on March 19 and returned on the 28th. Have to say overall they have improved since my last flight in 2011 and dramatically so in the last 10 years. My pet peeve however is the lack of safety enforcement on the plane on takeoff and landing. Unlike other airlines not a single flight attendant came around to make sure seats were in the proper position (many were fully reclined) and several people were up and walking around indeed going into the overhead bins during or shortly after takeoff and landing on both flights! Very dangerous. Also although I had requested a gluten free meal I was served my gf meal with a wheat roll sitting in the coffee cup. Good thing I am every vigilant and did not assume that this was the best gluten free roll ever made! Also wish they would allow one to choose seat assignments at the time of booking like every other airline on the planet.

Vienna to Rome on March 12 and from Rome to New York on March 16. The best long distance and also short distance flights we've experienced. Great seats with lots of room good food and friendly helpful crew. We had flown to Europe on Air France and had the worst flight in history! We were sceptical about our flights home as we had never flown with Alitalia. We had the best and most comfortable flights ever and we were even in Economy seats!

### Alitalia customer review
Business class from JFK to Tel Aviv changing planes in Rome. I chose Alitalia because of the 1-2-1 across seating in business. Their arrival/departure times at all 3 airports were convenient. I used the business class lounges in all 3 airports: they were all relatively pleasant and much better than waiting at the gates. Complaints: Only on the first leg of the flight was there an English-language newspaper. While I have read some bad reviews of the lounge in Roma I found it pleasant if not outstanding. They did have decaf coffee which is a big plus for me. The food selection was limited and unexciting but I did expect better on board the flights themselves. Unfortunately on the JFK-Rome legs the food was truly awful and did not taste good. Perhaps the speciality meals would have been a better choice but I did not know in advance how bad the business class meals would be. I wish I had wrapped up some of the finger sandwiches from the Rome lounge and taken them with me back to NYC.

### Alitalia customer review
Travelled with my husband from Sofia Bulgaria to Rome Italy and back with business class tickets. Inbound flight operated by Bulgaria Air and the outbound by Alitalia. The service I received was not up to the standards applicable for business class. We went through the same security and border control lines as economy passengers waited in the same area as economy passengers boarded the same bus and we boarded at the exact same time as economy passengers. Received no better service from the flight attendants. The only difference I saw was that the food in the business class cabin was better. On the first flight we did not check bags and printed the boarding passes at home. On our way back we had to check in one bag. There was a desk with sign "sky priority" with just one person serving customers. After the second flight my bag was not the first one to arrive although it was the only one with priority tag. In both cases we had to be transported from the airport to the plane by a bus. That was a terrible experience for business class passengers. On our way back we boarded the bus with priority but this means that we were one of the last ones to board the plane there was already no space for our handbags. Not entitled to lounge access either in Rome nor in Sofia. First flight was on time but was 30 minutes early on arrival in Rome. The second flight was 30 minutes late departing. Inbound flight was on a Embraer E-190 aircraft where we had 2 seats on each side of the aisle. The seats in business class are not wider do not have more leg room do not recline better than those in economy - they are the exact same seats. Outbound flight was on a Embraer E-175 aircraft which is essentially the same as the above with some "extra" - none of the first class seats has a window!

Rome-Fiumicino to Tel Aviv-Ben Gurion and return. Both flights of 3 hours with old Airbus A320 the cabin crew served a lunch on the outbound leg and a dinner at the return you could also take more drinks in the galley in the rear part of the aircraft. On the FCO-TLV leg we took-off 15 min. late but we arrived on time on the TLV-FCO route we took-off and landed on time. Nothing to complain I will fly Alitalia again.

### Alitalia customer review
I flew Tel Aviv to Paris CDG via Rome in January and then Rome to TLV in February. Overall I'm pretty impressed by Alitalia. The gluten free meal served on the TLV-FCO leg is excellent and showcases simple Mediterranean cooking. Staff are always friendly and all my flights have been on time. Cabin crew did become rather short however in dealing with difficult passengers when there was no more space in the overhead lockers despite announcing a strict 1 bag policy on boarding (not enforced I think).

### Alitalia customer review
Flew from JFK to Rome. A330 in excellent condition. Seats were super comfortable with lie flat. 1-2-1 config is great. Entertainment system was excellent with large screen and excellent selection. Food was ample nicely presented. Excellent pasta. The cabin crew was very friendly and attentive. Overall impressed. Much better than my experience on Swiss or United or Lufthansa. On par with Delta's Business Elite.

IST-FCO-MIA AZ630 28 Jan travel between Rome and Miami in Premium Economy. I have flown AZ long haul several times in both Business and Prem Eco and quite like the hard product. I particularly like the Business seat it offers good privacy and nice comfort. On this trip in Prem Eco I found the seat somewhat uncomfortable. Well- padded the recline however is awkward and does not have a good recline. What bugs me about AZ is the crew is always reactive to the passenger; never anticipating passenger needs. When asked however service is provided quickly and graciously. On this trip however call lights went unanswered and crew was hard to find. AZ also seems to have an unwritten practice that employees family members and friends traveling with a crew member can sit wherever they find a vacant seat - in any cabin they want. This becomes a distraction to the working crew as they focus more on their traveling companions and less on higher-fare paying passengers.

Flight 318 FCO (Rome) to CDG (Paris) January 26 2014. Flight departed and arrived on time seat somewhat uncomfortable not much in the way of a complimentary snack or beverage (tiny bag of bread sticks juice).

We caught a connecting flight with Alitalia from Paris to Rome - a very old plane and luckily it was a short flight. Then we flew Alitalia from Rome to NY a very long 10 hr disappointing flight! The TV monitors didn't work and the staff didn't seem to care even after numerous complaints. The food was horrible! Some awful lasagne or chicken. After serving this the staff disappeared for the remainder of the flight and passengers were asked to go to the back and help themselves. Then an hour before landing they served cheese sandwiches which were inedible. The seats not to mention were so uncomfortable and I'm short and even I couldn't stretch my legs out. If the person in front reclined their seat you were eating in your lap. I will never fly Alitalia again.

Traveled from Toronto to Rome Rome to Lamezia August 1 - 16 2013. This Airline needs to get back to basics on how to keep their travelers happy and wanting to come back and fly with them. The staff all need a course in customer service. This is one airline I will never fly again.

Alitalia from Heathrow to Rome was the worst flying experience I have had - December 22 and 23 2013. Horrible service no information after we were bumped. No one in charge no one taking care of passengers - 24 hour delay with a measly 5 pound voucher. I could not believe the horrible flight either - grumpy staff and terrible customer service - will not fly Alitalia again.

FCO-YYZ in Business Class. Boarding at FCO from a seemingly temporary hall (terminal H) without enough seating space then by bus to the aircraft. Staff courteous but not very well trained or competent. Seats in Magnifica class recline to almost horizontal but still at an angle of some 15 degrees from horizontal which pushes your feet towards the footrest not very comfortable. My own seat could not return to complete upright but none of crew seemed to notice. Moreover pitch and width are less than other airlines in Bus. class. Inflight entertainment is pathetic with portable screens supplied on request. Food just acceptable. Good punctuality.

VIE-FCO-CAI and back. The Flights were horrible. The stewardess don't speak English just Italian. The food was a joke: on the second leg (FCO-CAI) a 3.45 hours flight you get a slice of raw meat and a slice of Cheese and a Fruit salad. The seats have minimal legroom and are not cushioned well. On an 3.45 hours flight no entertainment. Even no overhead screens. The security instructions were shown bye the flight attendants. Please avoid Alitalia even when the price is good.

FCO-VIE-FCO. Both legs on an A321. Considering the fact that we flew during Christmas holidays all flights were smooth and punctual. Service provided by the flight crew was discrete and they came every time I asked for assistance. The food (mostly snacks biscuits and drinks) were quite good and adequate for a medium haul flight. Basically it was what anyone would expect from a flag carrier and I really appreciate the fact that Alitalia still remain a very good airline despite it's economical situation. I will flight with them again and I recommend it to other people.

Rome to Florence and return. I usually fly this route quite often. Even if it's a very short flight I've never had a problem. Alitalia uses the A319 on this route and I think that's ok comfortable and always clean. Cabin crew and food service ok.

FCO-CAG-FCO with A321 and A320 inbound. Both flights were punctual packed and yet the service on board for such a short trip was very pleasant. Flight attendants were smiling and professional.

### Alitalia customer review
Recently flew from Italy to Japan. The flight was ok the service uninspiring and the cabin very tight with little leg room especially for such a long trip. My complaint stands with an agent and Alitalia's policy that convinced us 3 in our party to pay for the upgrade to the seats situated near the door in economy class for more leg room. Because it was an international flight the cost was close to $100 each seat while we had the extra leg room we also had to contend with endless lines of people standing in front of us for the rest rooms people stretching their legs and the constant blare of the bathroom lights each and every time a door was opened. I think it is a terrible policy to charge such a premium price just for a little leg room and I greatly discourage others to think again if considering this additional cost it is not worth it. In general I only would consider using Alitalia again because they offer a very competitive price for the market.

### Alitalia customer review
I have to say that my trip to Rome (from JFK) on 11/8 with a return on 12/4/13 was by far the worst flight experience I have had. Even the lowest of the low-budget airlines provide a better service than Alitalia. 3 weeks before I traveled I broke my foot I called to see if I could get assistance getting on and off the plane. The agent told me "no you have to request that at the time of booking". I was in a cast and had a cane I figured someone would help me from the airline. I was wrong again. Not getting on board not in seat selection not exiting the plane in Rome down a huge staircase that dropped us out in the middle of the tarmac. I had to beg a steward to help me which he did grudgingly. The return was easier. When I told the staff member at check in I was at the gate for early boarding because of a broken foot she asked "Did you ask for assistance? I said no because I couldn't get any on my way here I assumed it would be the same on the return she just said "oh" and let me board. Again no help offered. On both flights the food was awful. Chewy greasy macaroni on the way over. A block of chicken nugget on the way home. On the one time they passed by with a beverage cart I asked for tea with sugar the steward said "you already have sugar". When I insisted I didn't he said well you do. And that was it. No sugar. After that if you wanted something to drink you had to get up and beg for it. I felt like I was interrupting their own private party in the back. The most startling incident though was when the stewardess slammed my window shade shut about 4 hours into the 9 hour flight. I raised it again and said I preferred to keep it up. The stewardess slammed it shut and hissed it was their policy to keep the windows shut! No windows no sugar inedible meals high priced a TV stuck in Chinese (with no way to change it to English) no assistance on or off not what I would call good service. Take American Airlines British Air Aer Lingus Lufthansa Delta Air Berlin instead.

Roma Fiumicino (FCO) - Tokyo Narita (NRT) and return. The aircraft was a quite full B777-200ER. We were served two meals (lunch and dinner) by a professional cabin crew and in the rear part of the plane there was a free bar for everyone. The seat was quite comfortable even for a tall person like me. The entertainment system was pretty good. I will definitely fly them again.

Flew from London to Rome and return. 2hr 15 minute flight. Left London on time at 0645hrs and got a glass of juice and a small packet of biscuits. When did airlines stop giving food or even giving you the chance to buy food. Return trip was at 2030hrs and it was exactly the same. Left 20 minutes late. Captain said it was because of air traffic control. Strange then that I could still see them loading the luggage bins on after the departure time.

London to Brindisi via Milan out and via Rome back. Haven't flown Alitalia for several years and was shocked at the complete absence of catering services. On all 4 flights there was a very poor selection of drinks (soft drinks only) and absolutely no food whatsoever apart from a tiny packet of savoury snacks - and this even on the Rome to London sector with a scheduled flight time of 2 hours 45 minutes. At least on budget airlines you can buy food - but on Alitalia there is nothing. Plus points are the cabin decor which is attractive and clean and the seats which are comfortable with good legroom. But why this complete absence of catering from the national carrier of a country which has such wonderful food and wine?

We flew FCO-Paris return. The first flight we had was aboard an Air One plane and was very basic. Cabin staff looked dishevelled and were not friendly they looked like they did not want to be there at all. I went to use the toilet and there was no toilet paper toilet stank and looked like it had not been cleaned in years. Flight was delayed an hour and when asking on board what time we will be arriving as we had transfers booked i was told the flight is 2 hours that was all. Very bad experience and as a travel agent I will not be recommending this airline.

### Alitalia customer review
We walked onto a beautiful new plane the staff was wonderful and the food decent but the headrests were so incredibly uncomfortable and there was nothing we could do to improve the situation - the rests basically push your head foreword leaving you with a bent neck and no back support. I will never fly them again simply for this reason. Check in prevented us from carrying on our luggage - she said my bag was too heavy/large but once onboard it seemed everyone had bags bigger than mine. Onboard staff was nice - attentive and accommodating. The temperature was ridiculously warm and stuffy. The inflight entertainment device was difficult to use and offered limited options.

Having read all the poor reviews of Alitalia I was a little concerned but since this flight LAX-FCO was the best option for my FF awards ticket I decided to chance it and was pleasantly surprised. The flight was on time the food was very good and presented in a very appealing way. The FAs were professional and very attentive throughout the flight maybe not as smiling as some others but still were pleasant. The lie-flat seat was very comfortable and I was able to sleep a few hours. Overall I was very pleased and would fly with them again.

Toronto to Rome. Worst airline I have flown. Food was dreadful. We were offered half a glass of wine and were told that if we wanted more we would have to purchase it from duty free. The crew spent most of the time at the rear or the aircraft behind a curtain. The plane was so old it had ashtrays. The seats were so soiled we has to use plastic bags to sit on. Don't fly this airline at all costs.

My husband and I flew on 10/26/13 from Rome to New York in economy class. My husband's seat had a metal box in his foot space making the 9 hour flight extremely uncomfortable. The seats were tight together and uncomfortable. The video equipment was old and non user friendly. After the initial meal service (with terrible food) the flight attendants disappeared. Two hours before landing a flight attendant came down the aisle offering plastic cups of water or Pepsi that were on a tray. This was the first beverage offer for the past 5 hours. She ran out before she reached our row and never returned. I got up and asked another flight attendant for a cup of water. She said she was unaware of any beverage service but would check into it - she never returned. One hour before landing a snack and beverage was offered. The flight attendants appeared totally indifferent to us and I never saw a smile. The cabin was not kept clean. The only trash pick-up was for the trays after meal service and all other trash had to be placed in the seat back and never collected. Two people in the aisle opposite us landed with their seats fully reclined there having been no final cabin check. The passengers behind them had to ask them to put up their seats so they could get out of their row. We will never fly Alitalia again.

July 18th. AZ 317: Paris (CDG) - Roma Fiumicino (FCO). AZ 1749: Roma Fiumicino (FCO) - Catania Fontanarossa (CAT). August 2nd. AZ 1714: Catania Fontanarossa (CAT) - Milano Linate (LIN). AZ358: Milano Linate (LIN) - Paris (CDG). As its capital is in some way mainly detained by Air France I was expecting that the airline was at least equal to Air France but it really depends on what flight you take. International flights: service is good it's a bit hard when you don't speak italian they are a bit rude but it does the job. Paris - Roma: average experience. Milano - Paris: very good experience. On national flights (Roma - Catania / Catania - Milano) it really isn't good at all. A321 but inside they aren't clean at all seats are leather trim but in bad condition. There is trash and dust everywhere. When you get onboard flight attendant was there but she was checking something in the galley and did not pay any attention to passengers - totally unaware of customers. This behaviour isn't isolated. It was on the national flight from Roma to Catania the worst flying experience I have had. The national flights really have to be improved.

29 Oct FCO-YYZ one way. Brand new A330-200 clean and bright. Check-in was easy as I traveled with carry-on only I printed my boarding pass through AZ kiosk. Cabin crew (almost only men) very attentive and nice food very good good choice of drinks open bar at the back. seat just fine being 183 cm long I had some problems stretching my legs so I had to go for some walk through the flight. departed and landed on time boarding was a bit chaotic as AZ call for a generic economy boarding they don't go by rows. I understand it is not one of the best airlines in the world but what they provide is above average. there is always a touch of Italian fashion in any aspect of the flight.

### Alitalia customer review
Check in was in Naples and then short flight to Rome and then non-stop to Chicago on October 26th. Will never fly Alitalia again! Check in person and cabin crew were rude! Not a smile or an interest in doing their job anywhere! Check in person gave me a seat opposite of what I ask for and it was horrible! Cabin staff spent minimal time serving passengers but hours behind a curtain! They did not check bathrooms which were smelly dirty and lacked toilet paper most of the time. Air vents as you looked down the aisle were filthy!

### Alitalia customer review
Alitalia is quoted as a full service airline but our recent experience (end of October 2013) would say its really a no service airline. 06.45hr departure in the morning from London 2.5hr flight with another 1.5 hour connecting flight. No coffee or tea was offered (juice or water only) plus a very small packet of biscuits was the best they could offer. The crew spent 80% of the flight (all 4 flights) chatting to one another. Only redeeming factors were all flights were on or close to time and the baggage transferred faultlessly.

FCO-MAD in Business. Flight on time nice cabin crew wide choice of drinks and good food. Pleasantly surprised.

### Alitalia customer review
At 6 ft 5 when I booked my flight in January 2013 requesting bulk head or exit row seats they told us then those were already reserved. Flight from Toronto to Rome was brutal and I can assure you we'll never fly Alitalia again in spite of the fact we travel abroad frequently. The box in front of my wife's seat made it even worse for her. Never again and in speaking to people around us every single one of them had the same complaint.

FCO-JFK on September 2013. Flight was on time. Seats were comfortable. Food was OK but included wine made it all better. Entertainment was pretty good.

### Alitalia customer review
The plane is old and the washroom is horrible. Needs a lot of maintenance. Fortunately it was just a 2 hour flight from Amsterdam to Rome. Staff were not professional they ignored calls from customers during the flight. They just stayed at the rear of the aircraft talking among themselves.

### Alitalia customer review
In September we flew London-Rome-Catania return. The outbound flight from London was reasonable. We didn't see much of the crew. However on arrival in Catania my luggage did not appear until 2 days later. The return flight sector from Rome to Catania was deplorable. About ten minutes after take off I went to the rear toilet and noticed the 2 flight attendants sitting there with the curtain pulled reading the paper. The toilet smelt badly and there was no toilet paper. I advised the flight attendant who thanked me but did nothing about it as my partner used same toilet later and still no toilet paper.

### Alitalia customer review
Rome to Toronto July 2013. Airbus 330 with falling off seats and interior trim no sound for the entertainment system wine or beer were the only drink choices. We could fly British Airways or any other Western European Airline for probably for the same price. Will never fly this airliner again. Poor service old aircraft's ugly airport lounge - total mess.

### Alitalia customer review
Flew from Toronto to Rome and then Rome to Toronto (end of Sep). Not impressed. Food was terrible condition of plane was poor and customer service let's see was non existent. As many others have commented they serve drinks then dinner and then they disappear for 5.5 hours. Even if someone pushes the bell for service they just ignore it. Unbelievable. Waited 2 hours to get our luggage in Toronto because they needed to search the luggage before they released it. Will never take them again.

### Alitalia customer review
My husband and I booked our round trip flight from JFK to Rome on January 19th of 2013. We traveled in September 2013. On both flights Alitalia changed our seats so that we were no longer sitting together. I am a former Pan American flight attendant and am horrified to see what the flying public must deal with today. The seats were so uncomfortable and the food inedible. We will never fly this airline again!

### Alitalia customer review
We recently flew from LAX to Rome and back in premium economy. The aircraft was clean comfortable and on time both coming and going but the crew from the ticket agents (check in) to the flight crew were somewhat rude and at times non existent during the flight. We were served on time but the food was inedible and the trays were not picked up for nearly an hour. My wife asked for a cup of tea and waited nearly 45 minutes to get it. This kind of service is totally unacceptable and we will not recommend Alitalia to anyone in the future.

### Alitalia customer review
My wife and I just had a wonderful trip from Malpensa to JFK in Business class. The on-board crew were excellent. They were courteous attentive responsive to requests and always had a smile on their face. They were also conversant in French and English as well as Italian. The lunch and snack were both very tasty visually appealing and served on time. The choice of wines was clearly enough for my palette. The reclining seat was comfortable even for my 6'3" body. And surprisingly the flight landed almost one hour before schedule. Alitalia does however need to improve several things. The ticketing process is laborious with a poor web site and no self-service kiosks visible at the terminal. Signage at the terminal needs improvement. And the loading of the plane could be improved by calling groups in sequence rather than the cattle-herding method now used. And couldn't news and sports be updated on the screen? The crew deserves a "10" rating. The balance of the ticketing/on-boarding process a "5".

### Alitalia customer review
Rome Fiumicino - Milan Linate and return. First flight on a full A319 we were served a drink and a muffin by a professional cabin crew. we landed in Milan 10 min early. The return was in the late afternoon of the same day it was operated with a quite empty A321 so i had 3 seats for myself. The flight was relaxing and also this time we arrived before the scheduled time. I will definitely fly Alitalia again.

### Alitalia customer review
Flew Alitalia from Rome to Lax on September 4 2013. Nice newer Boeing 777. They got us home safely. And the entertainment system was good. Otherwise the flight was less than satisfactory. Absolute minimal effort on the part of cabin crew. Lazy lazy lazy. Food Terrible. I was in Business class Ask for a Bloody Mary "Sorry only beer or wine" Entire cabin crew hiding somewhere most of flight. Walked all the way to the back galley to find a Stewardess. Again she informed me only Beer and Wine were available. I am still confused by this. I will avoid Alitalia in the future.

### Alitalia customer review
Flew from Vienna to Rome on 24th September at 11.20 am which took about 90 minutes. We were served a drink and a small packet of something that the Italians should be ashamed of. I asked one of the flight attendants if we would be served lunch (since it was at lunch time) and was told "no". Very poor.

### Alitalia customer review
This had to be the worst flight I have taken. We travelled in Premium Economy. The aircraft was clean and on time but everything else was terrible. The check in personnel in both Los Angeles and Rome were rude. The flight attendants were not much better. They served the inflight meal and returned only to pick up the trays and that was an hour later. They never returned to pick up trash or ask if we needed anything else. The food was poor and inedible. This was my first and last trip on Alitalia.

### Alitalia customer review
My husband who is 6'4" and I flew from Rome to LAX on July 20th. I made seat reservations when I booked the flight 9 months earlier and confirmed them 3 weeks before the flight. We were bumped from 2 aisle seats to 2 middle seats in the middle aisle. Under each seat was a metal box that took away half the leg room. The staff in Rome was very rude. The flight staff sat at the back of the plane talking for most of the flight. The air conditioning didn't work - either too hot or too cold. To top it off the food was horrible. Next time I'll settle for 2 stops as opposed to this awful airline.

### Alitalia customer review
I flew Alitalia 4 times in the past 4 days. First flight was from Tirana International Airport to Rome Fiumicino on Sep 19th. Flight took off and landed on time so I guess this flight was pleasant on an A320. There was a choice of salty/sweet biscuits and a drink Pepsi/Water/Bravo and wine! Then I flew from Rome Fiumicino to London City Airport. I was travelling with my family and upon reaching our gate at Rome Airport we decided to check in towards the end because of the large lines of people waiting. For no reason whatsoever no bus came to pick us up for the next 30 minutes. Flew an Embraer plane to London which was rather odd considering the duration of the flight. I then flew yesterday Sep 22nd 2013 and the flights had similar problems. London-Rome took off at least 30 minutes late because of a busy runaway. Plane was an A320 once again and the flight was uneventful. Then from Fiumicino I flew to Tirana again on an Airbus A320! Flight to Tirana took off 1 hour late! In general I would fly Alitalia again.

### Alitalia customer review
My wife and I were in a group of 47 travelers flying Alitalia from New York to Rome and return. We have been on hundreds and hundreds of flights but our experience Alitalia recently is perhaps the worst ever. The primary reason was the seating situation. We were flying economy plus but most of the group was in economy. Not only were seats jammed together but they did not recline. It appeared they were moulded plastic seats with cushions that slid down a bit to offset the lack of replying. It was agony. The entire group without exception were totally negative on the seating situation. several of our group found themselves in seats that had metal boxes on the floor so they could not extend their legs fully. Breakfast" on our return flight consisted of two pieces of cake. Coffee was consistently lukewarm. Stay away from Altalia at least on their JFK to Rome service.

### Alitalia customer review
Accra - Rome Flight AZ845 Rome - Paris AZ7310. Terrible airline. Stopover time of 35 minutes schedule between 2 flights - Ridiculous knowing that the 2 terminals were extremely far from each other. Food and Beverage: Never saw such a poor offering - could not even touch the meal (and 2 of my neighbors felt the same). Luggage lost - Terrible staff (not giving any information). Poor aircraft quality.

### Alitalia customer review
AMS-FCO. I'm not impressed by Alitalia. I tried many airlines of the last months but this was my worst experience. Poor seat comfort. The crew came only once with water and coffee. They were very rude and were completely not interested in the passengers. Plane was old but the flight was on time.

I confirmed our flights on Friday for a Monday flight from Chicago to Rome to Verona. On Sunday I saw that the times has been changed. Flight to Rome was now 5 hours delayed and we had an 8 hour layover in Rome before landing in Verona late at night. I called but was not able to get an earlier flight to Verona - booked up. The plane to and from Rome out of Chicago was on an Air One plane - so dirty and broken down even the toilet seat was off and lying on the floor. Never again for Alitalia - disorganized and second rate.

Toronto - Rome - terrible service on board. Do not care service any entertainment available beside central old style TV on the middle of cabinet turned on after five hours of flight playing inappropriate movie for my kids.

FCO-CDG-FCO. Departures and arrivals on time the flights were pleasant both times on a A321. Staff professional but worked without smiling at all food service requires an improvement only a packet of sweet or salty biscuits and a drink. I will continue to use Alitalia again for my next trips.

### Alitalia customer review
Flew from Toronto to Rome on an old broken down plane. The staff were very nice coming around all the time and the food was good. On other carriers they come and make sure your seat belts are fastened before take off and landing but not Alitalia did not see any of them checking. Nobody should fly with them anymore until they renew all their aircraft's.

### Alitalia customer review
We flew from Toronto to Rome and connected on to Tel Aviv. We then flew return. These flights however were truly awful. It is the YYZ-FCO routes that were terrible. I spoke to many different Alitalia contacts to find out beforehand if there were personal TVs on board and was told each time there would be as these were all new planes. When we arrived at the airport in Toronto we found out it was A330 AirOne flight we were taking. It was one of the oldest and dirtiest airplanes I have been on. The ash tray between the seats was filled with chewed up gum the seats had no cushioning there were no personal TVs and it was just all around dirty. While I picked up dinner in the airport my family got the on board meals which looked awful. Yes we got there safely but the dirty plane awful meals and lack of personal TVs on such a long flight made it a terrible flight. On the way back again very old A330 but this time I think the state of the plane was even worse than the one going there. While we chose our seats months in advance we ended up with 2 rows of 2 right in front of the WC and the last row did not recline at all. They had changed the plane so that the configuration we chose from was not the one we flew. This plane was even dirtier with yellow padding under the seats showing duct tape to hold together some of the seats. The attendants came around once in 10 hours with water. The first meals was provided right after take off and the second more than 8 hours later just before we landed. We will never fly Alitalia again long haul. Our short hauls between FCO and Tel Aviv were an A321 newer and just fine. So we'll fly a short haul but never a long haul.

### Alitalia customer review

### Alitalia customer review
My wife and I were making a connection from MAD-FCO. We flew into DFW and changed terminals in MAD the layout of the airport is strange in MAD and finding the ticket counter was a bit of a pain. Once there the ticket agent checked us in and told us where to go very robotic no smile no emotion. Once at the gate the gate agent called and made the boarding announcement 15 minutes later everyone was on the plane and the plane door was shut. The plane was comfortable clean and crew were friendly. Arrived on time into FCO. Ground staff could be more friendly and the announcements at the gate needed to be more frequent. The return was about the same out of FCO. Overall I would fly them again.

### Alitalia customer review
Two different flights: AZ300 and AZ305 LIN-CDG-LIN as a Skyteam transit flight. Flights both on time. Crew were not really that nice. On the return flight the crew waited until descent to serve and this caused confusion onboard. Everything was good for a 1.5 hour flight but the thing I can't stand is the check-in service in Linate. I had a skyteam ticket on multiple airlines (AZ/DL/AF). Each site of the selected airline pointed me to each other and when I was able to do it on the AF site the tool didn't make it possible to change seats. Called AZ and they didn't answer called AF in Italy and they didn't answer called AF in France and they said the entire site had a problem so it was impossible to check-in online. Went to LIN ground staff pointed us to the compulsory "self check-in" that surprise didn't worked either. Finally they let us check-in at the usual desk and everything was good. If there are strict alliances between Airlines at least give passengers a good check in tool for every flight!

FCO-BOS 22 August 2013. Check-in Service at Fiumicino Airport has greatly improved. Good customer service be prepared and all will go smoothly. On board we had in-flight entertainment a new A-330 that we Bostonians never had until this year! The all male cabin crew were outstanding friendly and helpful. Food was good but check the expiration dates as the dessert fruit cup had the same day exp date smell test proved ok. All in all I noticed an improvement in Alitalia Service which has not been the case in previous years.

### Alitalia customer review
FCO-BOS on 22 August 2013 Check in service at Rome Fiumicino went nicely. The woman was smiling and very friendly and handled our suitcases well. Boarding a Fiumicino was 10 minutes late. It was great to see that Alitalia brings a brand new A330 to Boston. Luckily there was inflight entertainment on the flight unlike in the past. It worked very well and was a new touch screen. Sometimes the system froze but most times during the flight worked well. We had an all male cabin crew. They did really well and were always considerate and kind. The food was pretty good but average for economy class food. The seat in front of me was pushed far back and the entertainment screen was in my face for a few hours of the flight. The landing in Boston was great. I didn't even know we had landed until the wheels smoothly touched the runway. The pilots did very good and smiled at passengers when leaving the plane. Overall a very good experience with Alitalia this year compared with times in the past.

### Alitalia customer review
Milan-Rome-LA. Classica plus on long haul. Domestic flights good both ways and on time. Flight going to the US 18/7 was on time and in general a positive. Priority boarding at Rome nice and easy good start. Enjoyable flight with nice friendly professional cabin crew. Food was good. After all we were leaving from Italy (shouldn't make a difference but does). Large entertainment screen and audio were very good. Comfortable seat with that all important extra leg room. Nice on board kit with good quality blanket. Return flight to Rome from LA 9/8 and what a difference. Same airline but a very different and this time negative experience. After over an hr's delay at LAX boarding started where priority boarding just didn't exist! Once on board we were greeted with very rude cabin crew who could hardly smile! This continued for the whole flight. Just rude and couldn't care less attitude from the crew. Food inedible and cold. Thank goodness for the snacks available throughout the flight at the back of the plane. We were three in classica plus 2 tickets on miles and one full price. Good on miles but not worth the cost of a full price ticket.

Rome to Miami business class. Cabin was great food was super. Given a Bulgari bag with all the miscellaneous for travel. Pillow and blanket - excellent. Everything was simply great. The only bad thing is the crew who are only at a fair level and don't smile at all.

### Alitalia customer review
Flight AZ7008 diverted to Malpensa airport instead of Linate due to weather problems. It is fine safety goes first. I do understand planes can be diverted and I really do not have a problem with that. What I do not understand is how a company as Alitalia has such bad service (actually no service) in such cases.…Nothing was arranged in Malepnsa nobody knew what is happening and the most shocking fact is when you find one of Alitalia's ground staff they turn around and tell you: I am going home! In this whole story none of Alitalia's staff said sorry once. The most disorganized airline!

### Alitalia customer review
I recently took a trans-atlantic flight from Chicago to Rome with my two kids and it was the worst experience in customer service. Horrible treatment by cabin staff who constantly behaved as if they're being forced to serve and were taking it out on passengers. The choice and quality of the food and beverages was poor. Will never fly Alitalia again if I can help it.

22/08/2013 Rome to Amsterdam and return 25/08/2013. All flights on a 321 old but well maintained (the second aircraft was better than the first one). On the FCO-AMS leg we took off about 30 minutes late due to heavy traffic in the airport the flight from AMS to FCO was smooth and we arrived on time. The catering could be better (a pocket of cookies or pretzels and a drink) but was sufficient for a 2 hours flight. No inflight entertainment. Staff professional but a little bit unfriendly. Will fly again.

New York (JFK) - Rome (FCO) on 7/23/13. The plane was very nice and clean. However the service was terrible. In New York we approached the counter at the gate to fix our tickets because our seats were wrong. We told the lady working there and she said that you have seats and you should be happy. I have children and they were seated in different parts of the plane. Eventually we began to argue with the worker because they ignored us and we had to beg with another for our assigned seats. Once again the plane and food were fine but the blankets were dirty and smelt terrible.

Rome to Chicago O’Hare 8/11/2013 Flight AZ0628. Not thrilled with our experience. The meals have very little in them and didn't fill us up at all. Crew appear to be unhappy with their job. Service is extremely slow. Smiles are rare. If you express your opinion on something ask for extra food they become defensive. My husband's headphones wouldn't stay plugged in my daughter's remote control wasn't working. The blankets that come in a plastic bag didn't smell clean at all. I doubt that they were washed. The restrooms smelt bad and looked dirty. Planes were old. The tickets were cheap and you get what you pay for.

We flew to Amsterdam through Rome and came back yesterday following the same itinerary. The planes were in bad condition all 4 of them and there was no food served on any of the 4 flights. They just offered us some cookies or salty crackers and a drink. On our way to Amsterdam we were starving. My friends flew to Amsterdam with Aegean through Munich and they had 2 hot meals!

Service: Flight attendants were surly and unhelpful on every 6 flights we took last month. After sitting on a hot plane 45 minutes late in departure from Rome to Toronto I asked an attendant to please ask the pilot to make an announcement and give customers some information her answer was "He's too busy to make an announcement". Food service was late no water available unless you got up and went to the back of the plane. Food: The worst in the world. Snacks are nutritionally awful and are always served late. Seats on the flight from Toronto to Rome were falling apart fabric ripped in many places seats dirty no magazines or information cards. Few toilets were working properly. Entertainment: There was one screen that comes down which was hard to see. There was one movie on a 9-hour flight. In short a memorable experience on Alitalia. A very bad one.

MXP-JFK and BOS-LIN via FCO economy class. All flights on time operated on well maintained aircraft's (A330 on intercontinental legs A319 on domestic one). Excellent and working inflight entertainment while the food was more or less the standard of economy class eatable but no more. The real point of weakness of Alitalia are the cabin crews sometimes professional but often with no enthusiasm at all for their job. All in all Alitalia offers a good product.

### Alitalia customer review
Flew last week from Toronto to Brussels via Rome on a brand new A330 and on an A321. Both flights left on time and in Rome we landed 30 mins in advance. Flight attendants were very courteous in both flights and the meal on the intercontinental flight was absolutely of excellent quality abundant and any drink for free without limitation. The entertainment system on board is modern and varied to spend so many hours. In general the service was thus above the average of other European airlines and we have not encountered any problem during transit in Fiumicino.

### Alitalia customer review
Our experience with Alitalia was very poor. We paid extra for seats with more leg room only to find that because of the extra space passengers as well as the staff used this room as an aisle so we actually had to keep our feet tucked under our seats so that people weren't tripping over us. Then the overhead lighting didn't work nor did the audio equipment. We found some of the staff to be extremely unfriendly. Gate line ups were very chaotic. Would never fly with them again.

From Istanbul to Rome on June 29. Check in agent for Business Class refused to attend us though is clearly mentioned that they "welcome" passengers flying Classica Plus at this counter. Returned to the queue and once attended was informed that my suitcase was with extra kilos. So I had to explain and teach to the agent that as I was coming from Brazil I was allowed to carry 2 pieces of 32 kg each and not 23 kg as she was trying to convince me. They don't even want to have "the job" to read carefully the e-tkt before mention such a thing. Third trip with this airline and always with issues.

VIE-FCO-CTA-FCO-VIE. Avoid this airline at any cost. Non existent customer service - overcharged for a pet in the cabin (EUR 158 for 4kg dog). CTA check-in and through security big shambles. Although we were at check in 2 hrs prior almost missed the flight because of long queues. When I've asked the local staff to assist and check us in so we don't miss the flight the response was "I don't care"! No organisation at all - people jumping queues rude staff running from one plane to another as no stairs to disembark etc. Stress all around. Easyjet is like a bizjet service compare to these people.

### Alitalia customer review
A party of 9 family members flew from several locations around the US to Rome and Italy for a vacation. 4 of the members flew back from Rome to the US yesterday on Alitalia. The 4 who flew Alitalia were disappointed with the level of service on the plane. Meals were noticeably sub-par when compared to the service 2 weeks earlier on other carriers and the service provided by the carriers flown by other members of the family. Surprised at the announcement 4 hours before landing that "drinks and snacks are available at the rear of the plane. We also noticed that the staff made one sweep of the cabin collecting food containers. Anything after that was not picked up. As we deplaned the plane looked like a park after a rock concert: paper napkins cups and wrappers everywhere. The cloth seat covers were soiled and in poor condition. The only good thing I can say is that the pilots did an excellent job. Flight and landing were smooth.

Last Autumn we booked to fly from Malaga to Toronto via Rome. On arrival at Malaga we received our boarding passes for both flights the second flight showed a take off time of 1700 not the 1000 we had booked and had confirmed. When we arrived in Rome we had difficulty finding out what the problem was. After much haranguing of staff we eventually got a meal voucher (limited amount) and a phone call to our family at destination. The flight eventually took off at about 1800 an 8 hour delay.

LHR-FCO-FLR-FCO-LHR in a mixture of Business and Economy and a mixed experience overall. Check-in at LHR was a little confusing and I recommend looking out for the special check-in area (not signed) for business passengers. I found the food offerings on Business quite disappointing and the business lounges pretty poor. Nevertheless the service was pleasant and the short flight from Rome to Florence quite an exciting experience.

### Alitalia customer review
June 8th Rome to Genoa. Tried to check in through the machines available however all of them were unable to make the procedure due. Had to stay on the line for check in. Once at the gate passengers were informed that the flight was delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft in Rome. (No more information provided). Only on board captain informed us that due to an emergency landing of an another aircraft one of the two runway was closed. Due to this fact we had to wait around 1 hour with the doors closed awaiting the clearance for push back. Can't blame Alitalia for this but the ground staff procedure was unprofessional at least. Actually we stayed inside of the aircraft still on the ground for almost 2 hours. Once again at least I was expecting someone to advise me to buy some food before boarding the aircraft. For a flight of 40 minutes it took almost 5 hours.

In June we went on vacation to Italy and as we had a multiple city itinerary only this airline could serve us without the hassle of connecting flights. Outbound flight from Sao Paulo to Rome was uneventful however the seat pitch of the Premium Economy definitely does not exist. It only goes a bit down and that's all. If you are lucky and get the first row then you'll have more legroom otherwise save your money and fly on economy. Prior to take off you got a travel kit and a glass of juice or sparkling wine. The main meal though better presented was mediocre. I pre ordered a vegetarian meal totally uninspiring. No taste no sauce. Arriving in Rome the baggage claim was delay because the ground staff could not open the compartment.

I recently flew JFK-FCO on Alitalia's Airbus A330. Everything was fantastic. Flight attendants were all very nice except for one who wasn't very friendly. I got up to go to the bathroom the curtain was closed but the bathroom was right behind it. I opened the curtain and she gave me a rude glare and snapped the curtain shut. I had to go use a bathroom behind where I was. Anyway the seats were excellent. I will definitely fly Alitalia again on my next trip to Italy.

LIN-LHR-LIN. Both flights on time first one on an old but clean and comfortable A321 second one on a newer A320 with personal LCD screens on each seat. Good legroom good value for money and adequate service. I would definitely fly them again.

LHR-FCO-CTA return in June. Overall it was a good experience but in the months between buying the tickets and the actual flights they changed our itinerary 3 times. This was due to departure time changes and eventually cancellation of the domestic leg. These changes were communicated to us in email and in Italian language without offering alternatives refund or assistance. Bag drop at LHR a bit chaotic as Alitalia operates several flights in the morning and it seemed not enough desks were open. We ended up waiting 40 minutes in the queue before getting fast tracked along with other passengers on the FCO flight. At FCO they seem to operate a coach service for every single flight. One flight out of 4 was significantly delayed (FCO to LHR). I liked the generous legroom on board. No sandwiches given out like BA does on European flights only a small pack of crisps and a drink. Flight attendants were professional and helpful. Despite the above issues I would fly with Alitalia again as they were helpful and professional when needed.

Flew Sao Paulo - Naples (connection in Rome-Fiumicino) June 2013. Flight attendants sometimes rude. Tried to upgrade from standard economy to premium economy but the upgrade cost was twice the cost of the entire ticket. Seats 20A and B. Seat 20A had a large box under the seat in front of me that really bothered me on the long flight. Catering was ok. Flight to Naples 3 hours delayed due to a hard landing at Rome airport that closed one of the runways.

Rome - Chicago June 21st Business Class. Plane was an A330 almost new. The "Magnifica class" is very comfortable the seats are spacious the food is excellent. The entertainment system was good. The problem was the staff. We were diverted to Detroit because O'Hare was closed for a thunderstorm. The problem is that we were left alone in the Detroit airport for about 7 hours without any kind of news or assistance. The crew just disappeared with no explanation. Very unprofessional!

### Alitalia customer review
I flew YYZ-FCO. Boarding was chaotic and the flight delayed by poor organization. The plane was old - dirty panels falling off the bathroom walls and bathroom doors that wouldn't close. The "entertainment system" was of the old tiny-dropdown-screen variety and even half of these didn't work. There were two functioning music channels. Food was appalling - and I'm not that picky on airlines. An inedible leathery over-microwaved "pasta" dinner and a "breakfast" that consisted of a tiny carton of yoghurt a small cup of watery lukewarm coffee and a pack of Oreos. The flight attendant sighed and said "the staff complains all the time but until passengers complain more loudly they won't do anything. A shame.

### Alitalia customer review
Chicago to Naples: No place to keep baggage / tight seats / no inflight entertainment / seating area lights (above each seats) were not working. Flight crew disinterested. All in all - I tried to save some money and instead got pennies worth of service for a few dollars less. Naples to Mumbai: just about the same - dirty seats food was not up to the meal request I made. Insolent staff. Toiletries for the rest-room were consciously missing and in spite of passenger complaints to the same - they were not replenished just because they weren't loaded in the first place. It was a 1 hr transit.

Sao Paulo to Nice (connection in Rome) on the business class (AZ0675 14 June returning AZ335 22 June). Airplane was broken and the only person available to give any information took hours to let us know what was going on. The next flight was the next day at 7am. When we arrived in Rome we had missed our connection we had to pick up our luggage and take a bus to a hotel. Nobody was there to help us. On the flight back to SP there was an electrical problem the seat didn't work so I spent 6 hours with a broken seat and didn't get any sleep at all. The movies were old.

Tel Aviv to Rome on an A321 business class May 20th. Seats are tight middle seat not used in business class. Plane was dirty. Back of seat showed streaks from spilled food/beverages. Even before plane took off I went to the rest room behind the cockpit. It smelled terrible. After takeoff staff rushed to hand out drinks and food and then set the rest of the trip. For a 4 hour flight there was no in flight entertainment. I will never fly them again.

### Alitalia customer review
My husband and I travelled to Europe for the very first time and Italy was our choice destination. From Chicago they told us that we had to be in separate seats and of course we protested since we booked months in advance after a few searches they said they found a couple of seats further back in the plane. Onboard we realized that it was one of the oldest planes we've been on complete with ashtray dingy carpet and upholstery and green TVs that drop overhead once we took off. I got a broken seat that made me sink lower in it! Flight was full so I had to endure it for 8.5 hours. Reading light was not working. As for the staff I wouldn't say they are the nicest people but doing their best. Upon landing at FCO in Rome we walked out into the tarmac took a bus walked a not so bad distance to baggage claim then it took 1.5 hrs for our one piece of luggage to come out. We already started dreading the flight back but we were just thrilled to finally be in Italy.

### Alitalia customer review
Chicago to Rome to Naples. From Chicago they put us on a very old Air One plane. Seat comfort almost non- existent there was no padding they were so old the seats and carpet were dirty old and unravelling at the edges. One of the worst flights I've been on. Flight from Rome to Naples very nice clean and comfortable. I guess Alitalia doesn't think you need to be comfortable on a 8-10 hour flight. I'll never use them again.

### Alitalia customer review
Trip of a lifetime to Rome. They got us there and back safely so I guess that counts as something. Customer service is horrible. We booked 7 months in advance to have 2 seats together in the Classica Plus. Arrived at JFK and told we were sitting separately. They changed the plane. Ended up sitting together in the middle row (with 2 other people) and the seats were so uncomfortable. Flight attendants were rude. Flight home also brought unpleasant faces. Given access to the VIP lounge. Food was pretty decent snacks were non-existent and restrooms not that clean.

### Alitalia customer review
Business Class from Rome to Buenos Aires was simply dreadful. No separate business class boarding - just had to join the scrum. Lounge in Rome was overcrowded hot smelly and had no food except for 3 bowls of cold rice for which they had at least provided a public microwave. Food onboard was no better. Despite flamboyant trolley service only the lukewarm pasta in tomato sauce was edible. The veal main course was tough and the vegetables tasted of chemicals. Incredibly Alitalia carry no gin vodka or whisky on board - only wine and a few cheap Italian liqueurs. The inflight entertainment simply did not work at all - which is a serious problem on a 13 hour flight. Breakfast was a hard roll and a dry croissant and a pot of inedible cherry jam. We were hungry when we landed. Throughout the crew were arrogant and offhand only really interested in chatting amongst themselves. All in all the worst business class experience I have had.

May 25-26 2013 Flights from LIN to LHR - Business Class. The a/c - A321 - was comfortable and clean. The crew kind and customer oriented. During the inbound flight was proposed an excellent breakfast while during the outbound one the light dinner was excellent too. Good money for value.

ATH-FCO-VLC. On the flight from ATH-FCO the cabin staff were very unfriendly. During the safety demonstration the cabin attendant was chewing gum. The onboard service was very poor. Alitalia offered a salty or a sweet snack. FCO airport saddens me. Very old dirty and chaotic. Airport staff very rude transfer was smooth. The FCFO-VLC sector was better. Cabin crew were a little bit friendlier than the previous one. Catering was exactly the same like ATH-FCO sector. Aircraft were quite old (former Air One aircraft). The only reason for choosing Alitalia was the ticket price.

### Alitalia customer review
FCO-BOS in Economy class on May 21 2013. Boarding relatively painless performed according to row from back to front after Elite status and Business class passengers. Plane was a pristine Airbus A330 Enhanced wide body with 2-4-2 configuration. Seat pitch generous for economy and seemed to afford an extra 1-2 inches of leg room. Inflight entertainment was state of the art for Economy class with a USB outlet and a decent variety of film music and gaming options. Operational immediately upon taking my seat. A novelty at least for me was the exterior camera that allowed views of take-off and landing. Seats were comfortable with fully adjustable headrests. Economy meal was actually quite tasty with pasta or chicken options. A full selection of beverages including wine were served at no extra charge. Apart from the plastic cutlery and plates the meal rivalled some I have been served in Business or domestic First class cabins. Crew professional polite and efficient with no surliness. They smiled and accommodated passenger requests when a call button was pressed. If this flight was an indication of the direction Alitalia is heading then I will fly them again at least on this particular type of aircraft without hesitation.

### Alitalia customer review
After so many negative reviews I was expecting the worst. Instead I was pleasantly surprised. On a short leg between Reggio and Rome the stewards stepped right up to help with luggage - this hasn't happened within memory on an American airline. Even managed to get in a beverage service. On the Rome to JFK leg the entertainment supplied without charge was top notch - I was able to watch movies for the whole trip and play some of the games the earpieces were large and comfortable unlike the horrible buttons on Delta on the way over. Food was fine for economy and several beverage services with good choices. While legroom not great the seats seemed to be wider than most - no bumping of/from my neighbor. Staff pleasant at ticket counter and on plane. Wouldn't hesitate to fly Alitalia again.

TLV-FCO-JFK. One way only as we booked return with other Skyteam airline. First impression of Alitalia staff in TLV airport was already very negative. Staff rude and unprofessional. First flight from TLV to FCO uneventful. Seats comfortable with enough legroom we were seated on row 8. Connecting flight after surviving several hours in very poor FCO Rome airport departed with 1 hour delay seats are extremely hard entertainment is ok personal screen very small. Food service began very soon after take off upon which all staff disappeared until 1 hour before landing. Food decent without being interesting. Alitalia needs to improve a lot before I will consider flying them again for me they remain a second class airline.

My wife and I flew round trip Boston to Rome this month. Both flights were non-stop leaving Boston at 5pm arriving Rome at approx 7am. Flight departed on time was quite smooth and flight staff pleasant enough. We flew premium economy so we would have a bit of extra space and I would definitely recommend it. While the cost was a bit higher than on other airlines it allowed me to sleep through much of the flight. Upon arrival our bags were available as soon as we made our way to the baggage claim area after we went through passport control. Our return flight was equally smooth departing Rome on time at 11am and arriving in Boston a bit early at 2pm. Upon arrival in Boston our bags showed up in a timely fashion and all was good. Meals served on both flights both main mean and a snack near to arrival and while none of the food was great I don't expect a significant dining experience in flight so again I was not disappointed. Both flights were their new 330 planes. All in all my experience was quite good and I would not hesitate to fly Alitalia again based on these flights.

We flew Premium Economy from Boston to Rome and back. We were very pleased. It is worth the extra money for Premium Economy.

Flew from Rome to Toronto. Air Hostess - unfriendly. They do not respond to individual calls. You have to get up and walk to the front or to the back of the airplane if you need water. I travelled with an infant when I asked for some milk one air hostess bluntly said no. Another was good enough to accept the bottle and asked for my seat number. However most of them were grumpy and look annoyed. Entertainment - No personal entertainment No power No USB. There are TVs at the centre which play videos. Most TVs were not functioning properly some screens were in mono color. Transport to Airplane - on crowded buses. So unorganized that passengers were asked to stay inside the bus for a long time after the bus had reached the plane. I do not recommend.

Rude staff at airport in Rome along with the staff at the Alitalia lounge in Rome. My husband needs wheelchair assistance and was treated as though he was a burden unlike other airlines who were very kind and helpful. Absolutely horrible service. Washroom was what you'd expect at a dirty gas station. Food - very poor. Never again.

Travelled FCO-LHR after connecting from SOF-FCO. Transfer at FCO T3 was actually very easy (both our flights connected here). However we needed to go to the Alitalia transfer desk for boarding cards for our onward flights and found the seats we chose at time of booking had not been honoured and we were split up 10 rows apart. Not happy with this. The flight was almost 30 mins late boarding and thus departing. They made some time up but we were still about 15 mins late arriving at LHR. For a flight scheduled for just under 3 hours I did expect more than one drink and a small bag of bread snacks. I expected on a full service carrier we may at least get a sandwich. No second drink run either. After this length of flight the recaro seats did not feel at all comfortable due to the lack of padding. Leg room was ok for this length of flight.

### Alitalia customer review
Travelled SOF-FCO in order to connect on to FCO-LHR. Despite the fact that Web-Check in did not work at all at the airport the check in queues moved fairly quickly. The seats I reserved at time of booking were honoured. This flight was fairly full and departed on time. We had a block time of just under 2 hours so thought we may get offered more than one drink. But not forthcoming. Not much padding on the recaro leather seats but not really a problem on a flight of this length. The cabin crew looked totally disinterested. I felt this was the bare minimum for a full service carrier.

JFK to FCO on AZ609. Flight incurred a 2 hour ATC delay. Cabin staff obliged passengers with beverages and constant updates. Cabin appearance was spotless and the dinner service very good! By the way the complimentary wines were good and the cabin crew served it up with Italian flair-Bravo! Our arrival into Rome was both speedy and efficient and everyone seemed rested and pleased. By the way we experienced no issues with our luggage as most passengers seem to mention. The airline continues to improve and offers surveys to select passengers for feedback and suggestions for a better flying experience. Much improved carrier!

Rome to Los Angeles on flight AZ620. Flight delayed 45 minutes due to an ATC delay in Rome but we still arrived in LAX on schedule. 777-200ER cabin was clean and the Alitalia decor was brilliant in color and design. The pilot was both professional and informative along our 12hr and 21 minute journey. Cabin crew were professional and well - groomed but a bit unfriendly! Lunch service out of Rome was good but the additional snack services need to be improved. Drink service was excellent! I was also pleased with the ground staff in Rome and pleased that our baggage arrived safe and sound.

Flight to Milan from Brussels AZ 7095 back some days after with AZ196. On both flights: Clean new aircraft's. Flight departed on time and arrived early on schedule. Very clean interiors and comfy recaro seats (even in Economy). Service on board was just a salty or sweet snack with juice coffee and a glass of good wine. So better than average on Eco flights over Europe. Flight attendants were smiling and did their job with professionalism. I was travelling with family and children and the flight was very relaxing. All in all very good experience.

Lets start with the good. On time plane clean lucked out and had an empty seat beside me. Flight attendants perfunctory at best. The food - never in my 50 years of flying overseas once or twice a year have I experienced anything quite as bad as my recent roundtrip flights from Boston to Rome. The food was barely edible the juices were thick sugar syrup with a chemical taste floury snacks were stale. The coup de grace was something the flight attendant called a zucchini pizza? It was a 2" thick piece of soggy white flour bread (calling it bread is being kind) with a thin layer of shredded zucchini with some type of indescribable flavoring. I took one bite out of sheer curiosity it tasted as disgusting as it looked. There is apparently no one managing their catering service. Anything seems to go! I don't expect gourmet in economy but I do expect vaguely edible. The vegetarian meals were equally bad. My suggestion should you choose to fly Alitalia bring your own food and drink.

Rome to Paris and return (FCO-CDG-FCO) first leg on a quite old A321 but well maintained return on a new A320.

The return was calm and all in all a good experience. Will fly again.

AMS-LIN (A320) and LIN-LCY (E190). Big jumble of flight numbers etc but both aircraft in Alitalia colours and what the ticket said so assume I flew them! Both flights comfortable especially LIN/LCY as aircraft seemed nearly new. Mid morning and afternoon travel times so soft drink and packet of nibbles fine for the flights and crew relaxed and smiling. Arrived on time-bags off quickly-good price - all that's needed. Used the self-print boarding pass at LIN (as no printer access when doing online check-in) Worked well and easy to use and in a choice of languages. Would use again.

Heathrow/Lamezia Terme return via Milan. 3 of the 4 flights were on time planes of varied ages but clean staff polite and level of service what you expect on short flights. The delayed flight was because of air traffic control and LHR congestion. My most impressive observation was when we were bussed from the aircraft into the terminal at Milan Linate. A member of the cabin crew carried an elderly passenger's small hand luggage down the steps and put it on the bus for her before going back onto the plane. That is caring service.

I recently travelled JFK to Rome in Premium Economy (Classica Plus). 50 minute delay out of JFK crowded conditions no entertainment in Premium and Economy Sections of the 777 food was dreadful - a dry chicken or a chopped beef and pasta entree that was very unappealing and all of it served with plastic cutlery. Crew were not very engaged and disappeared after it became evident that around 200 folks would not have entertainment on this long flight to Rome. Overall a dismal experience and not a great way to start a trip to Italy!

LHR-LIN and MXP-NRT in economy. Flight from LHR on time to Milan Linate. Very clean comfortable A320 with nice leather seats seatback LCD but no snacks. Overall Altialia's short haul service was a welcome surprise however I was disappointed that no drinks/meal service was provided. Return flight was similar and on time into LHR. MXP-NRT was my first long haul with Alitalia onboard 777. Very pleasant and professional welcome onboard however the cabin outbound to Tokyo was not cleaned sufficiently and found crumbs under my seat. Seatback IFE displays were small but provided an interactive movie/music/games/ menu seats also provided with AZ embroidered pillow blanket and headphones. Only problems I encountered with my seat was inadequate legroom due to the IFE box under my seat A and a scratched window on both flights. Catering onboard was fantastic and found the crew on both sectors hard working 2 main meals snacks on both occasions and a continuous drinks service. Choice of meals onboard was an expected Japanese or Italian. For a 12 hour flight I felt comfortable and well looked after by the crew. Both flights on time.

### Alitalia customer review
On the flight from JFK to Rome the inflight entertainment didn't work (staff didn't seem that interested in doing anything about it) the food was the worst airline food I have had in years and the seats were very uncomfortable. The next flight from Rome to Tel Aviv was equally as bad and involved the most disorganized boarding process with people boarding from both ends of the plane with no rhyme or reason. On all of the flights the staff seemed generally disinterested.

FCO-AHO and back on Alitalia flight out of Fiumicino left on time cabin appearance was very good and crew professional.

The service is improving better than a few years ago.

YYZ-FCO/FLR Toronto-Rome non stop: I flew Premium Economy. There was no special line for this class of service in Toronto. There was no invitation to the Lounge the staff welcome was fine but too concerned with the 4 in Magnifica Class and the full masses in economy. There were 6 of us in P. Economy section so nice and quiet. The seat recline was fine the leg rest was useless as I'm only 5'6. This did not elevate my legs in the least. The pillow and flimsy blanket were fine. Lots of room to manoeuvre between the seat in front. The plastic glass half full welcome prosecco was chilled nicely but that was the end of the sparkling wine. The food was not advertised in the generic brochure - a surprise on board it was the same food as economy class. 500 Euros more for Magnifica if bought on board I didn't bother. The overall pilot/flight was smooth and 40 minutes early November 18 2012.

Took Alitalia to Abu Dhabi last week. Flight from Rome was on a brand new A330 with the most generous legroom I have seen in a long time. Food was tasty on both flights. Flights on time. Flight attendants did not offer drinks during the flight but you could get drinks and snacks from the galley. In-flight entertainment also brand new with nice selection of movies. Cabin was clean.

I flew from Milan to JFK on AZ604 yesterday. The flight was great the food good for Italian taste and I was especially satisfied with the inflight service centre set up in the back galley after the main service. You can help yourself to drinks and snacks at your own convenience. This kept us well hydrated throughout the flight without having to wait for drink runs from the crew. The atmosphere on board was very relaxing.

Flew from Luxembourg to Rio and back to London in January. Long-haul flights were on Alitalia's brand new A330 which is a very nice plane. Sadly the overall experience wasn't great - the staff looked bored and disappeared for most of the flight the food was pretty disgusting (and I'm not a fussy eater) the in-flight entertainment system was very sticky (cue people hitting the screen behind your head for half the flight) and the selection of films was poor. The flights were ridiculously cheap so perhaps you get what you pay for in which case maybe this review should be an overall 9.

Greece to Toronto Ontario. Flight was ok but the service and my seating arrangements were absolutely horrible. I flew with my 2 daughters one who is 9 months old and even when I arranged for a bassinet for the baby I had my daughter for 11 hrs on my lap because apparently Alitalia only carries 2 Bassinets on the flight. After all this they lost my luggage when I arrived and it took 5 days for me to retrieve it. My first and last time I fly with them.

Flew VRN-FCO-MIA and back in Alitalia economy on a reward ticket. All flights more or less on time. Crew on domestic flights almost courteous crew on international flights presumptuous and on the brink of being outright brazen. On top of that they did not see any need to keep the airplane reasonably clean. The restrooms looked on both intercontinental trips like the restrooms of a run down railway station. If you have an alternative avoid Alitalia.

YYZ-FCO-IST. We flew with Boeing 777-200 from Toronto to Rome. We had a delay of half an hour. The airplane was decent. The cabin crew were not friendly. I ordered vegetarian meal and it was awful. I have flown this route before and the meal was the same for both flights. They never change the menu! The personal entertainment system was terrible. It had very limited variety of songs and movies. Also it did not work for about 2 hours. The snack was good and it was prepared specially for vegetarians. The seats were okay. When we landed to FCO the ground crew were rude and raised their voice to us just because we stopped for a minute to take out our boarding passes. From Rome to Istanbul the seats were uncomfortable. We had a delay of half an hour. The snack was good but it was very small. Overall I will totally not recommend this route because of the delays and the little leg-room.

AZ 681/680 from/to Buenos Aires to Rome in Magnifica Class. Fantastic seat configuration 1+2+1. Flight on time nice Aerolineas (Skyteam) Business lounge in new terminal C of EZE. Captain at the door welcoming all J pax. The Chief Purser introduced herself personally to all pax in J. Very nice Bulgari amenity kit. Lunch was served with individual placemat. Flight attendants move with a trolley and prepare the dishes for you upon request. Interesting Italian regional menus. Top Italian wines. 3 pastas and 2 main courses of meat and fish. Nespresso coffee (finally on board) pastries cheeses and fruit salads. Dish presentation can probably be improved but the quality of the food was impressive. Entertainment good but not extraordinary. The TV monitors are not last generation and quality of image is not state of the art. Too few blockbusters too many retro movies. Night open buffet with everything you need. Breakfast prior to arrival very good but not 5 star. Cabin attendants attentive and smiley. Good communication from the cockpit. Landed on time in Rome. Baggage came out 45 minutes after but this is not AZ fault. Same thing and the coming back flight apart from a minor communication from the cockpit.

MIA-FCO (seat 4L) and FCO-MIA (seat 4A) in late Nov 2012. Seat was very comfortable liked the way the table works and the large video screens are nice. I had a window seat and it had very good privacy. I thought the seat could have been a little longer for sleeping but it was comfortable enough. The centre section seats do not have air vents though those on the window sides of aisles (both the aisle and window) do have air vents. Video (movies etc.) were OK. The seat in general was the best I've been in out of Delta Air France KLM and Continental/United. However I'd have to say the service especially on the FCO-MIA leg left a good bit to be desired. Food wasn't properly heated on either leg though was good. On FCO-MIA (all daylight flight) the crew did a lunch service and then disappeared until they served the pre-landing meal. Other than the actual meal service they disappeared. This crew had some ice and a few drinks they put out self-service but then never showed up again. This aircraft actually has the seats split into two business sections - the forward section where most Magnifica seats are located (Rows 1-5) and then small section behind the doors with rows 6-7. Upon arrival in MIA my checked bag did not appear up on the carousel. I had a connection to make but needed to pick up clear customs and recheck my bag but that's hard to do with no bag. An agent got me through customs and sent me on to my flight all the while assuring me that my bag would make it. After boarding my Delta connecting flight the Delta agent came onboard to my seat and gave the me the bag check slip and my bag did indeed make the connecting flight.

I was on a return flight from Rome to Istanbul. I had booked a ticket on the website with an approximate 1% discount for EU citizens 25 or under for which I am a British EU citizen who was 25 at the time. On my flight to Istanbul I had to wait for quite a while at the counter to get my boarding pass. I do not speak Italian and the staff spoke among themselves in Italian for a long while without telling me what the problem was in fact not admitting there was a problem. There wasn't a big line so this didn't delay other passengers. Eventually they issued me my boarding pass. Ok a bit of a pain but not such a big deal. The flight was without incident. On my return flight Istanbul to Rome I got to the counter to collect my boarding pass and there was another holdup. The staff spoke amongst themselves for much longer than the first flight approximately 30-45 minutes. Again they wouldn't admit there was a problem and I asked several times what the supposedly non existent problem was with no luck. Again they spoke in their own language to each other and on the phone so I couldn't eavesdrop. They also made several phone calls. I was getting pretty anxious because I thought there was a serious problem. As there were only a small number of counters in operation for Alitalia in Istanbul at the time the line ballooned out as a result of the holdup and I wonder if some passengers missed their flights. Eventually the counter staff asked me if I was a student. I said no. They then told me to go and buy a new ticket without explaining why. When I pried them they told me it was because I had purchased a discount ticket without the right to do so. I then explained to them that Alitalia had offered an approximate 1% discount on their website for EU citizens 25 and under and the discount had nothing to do with being a student. The lady at the counter then made another call then issued me my boarding pass without apologising. I am not sure if it was the same problem on the outbound flight but It does seem rather odd that the staff appeared not aware of their own policy regarding the 25 and under discount for EU citizens (maybe the policy changed?) which is quite a common discount that many companies and organisations offer in the EU. Also if they had have admitted what the problem was from the beginning I could have resolved the whole thing right away. It also appeared to me to be a poor use of judgement to hold up the line for such a considerable amount of time over the question of a discount of approximately 1 euro. This upset me greatly. Otherwise the flight itself was without incident.

Economy JFK-FCO-MAD-MXP-JFK. They were on time aircraft appeared well maintained. Cabin staff was professional and responded to one's needs. I will definitely fly with them again.

We flew Toronto to Rome and back and I was pleasantly surprised with how good this airline was. The to flight was in an older plane but he staff was friendly and accommodating and our return flight was in a newer plane with interactive LCD's in each seat. I'm 5'6" and the seating was not cramped at all. The in flight food was decent as far as airplane food goes. Based on the reviews of Alitalia I was expecting a terrible experience - but that was not the case at all.

We flew recently in Magnifica (business) to Caracas (July 16th and August 27th 2012) and in Classica Plus (premium economy) to New York (November 4th and 19th). Not a terrible experience but sorry to say that our national airline is poor in terms of comfort service and quality of food. In Magnifica the service is not adequate at all (why are the flight attendants with some exceptions so rude?) and the food is very far from the Italian excellent international reputation. In Classica Plus we experienced seats not much more comfortable than in Economy very poor food light and headphones malfunctions. Extremely sad.

FCO-BRU and return (departure on 17-11-2012 return on 18-11-2012). Both flights on a clean A320 which was quite comfortable. Departures and arrivals on time efficient and polite flight crew and an appropriate food service for a 2 hours flight.

Toronto to Rome and back again. Couldn't get proper seat assignments due to inconsistent information at booking and then at check in. Spent in total 18+ hours in cramped miserable seats. Check in staff in Rome were extremely rude. There are no words for how bad the food was - they would be better off telling passengers to buy food at the airport prior to boarding because it was horrible. Boarding is basically a free for all with no queuing or filling the plane from rear to front - so it ends up with people racing for overhead bins. No assistance for families or elderly passengers. Basically they got us to Italy and back. But it was just an awful experience all around.

Flew American Airlines from US to Paris and back travelled by train to Rome then flew Alitalia from Rome to Tel Aviv then from Tel Aviv back to Paris connecting in Rome. The tickets purchased several months ahead were an excellent price. The ticket counter staff in both Tel Aviv and Rome as well as the staff on the plane were friendly helpful and professional. We had no trouble getting desired seats. We ordered vegetarian food which was excellent (fruit two salads fresh bread and butter cheese free wine) on both flights. The food on our Air France code share flight from Rome to Paris was a poor tuna sandwich but the staff and service were excellent.

Flew Heathrow to Rome and back as part of a package that included flight. The toilets on the outbound journey were disgusting. On the return journey the experience was the worst I have experienced. As others have said when the flight was called there was no orderly boarding of the plane. People pushed and shoved me out of the way to get on first even though seats had been allocated. Once onboard I could see why. Having spent ages finding the correct size bag to fit in the overhead lockers when I finally got onboard space was limited. Passengers were cramming bags in where they could. Whilst we were still climbing and with the seat belt sign still illuminated passengers started to walk around the plane the stewardesses said nothing. The carpet was threadbare throughout. This is clearly a budget airline with a disregard to rules.

### Alitalia customer review
I flew from NY to Rome. It was a long flight with a rude flight crew poor quality food and a dirty plane. It was a mad house from the ticket counter to the boarding gate. A real lack of organization and even less concern for their customers. Plane arrived on time but the 9 hour + trip was not enjoyable given the conditions.

### Alitalia customer review
LAX-FCO-PMO. FCO-LAX. All flights left thirty or more minutes late but we didn't miss any connections. The food was good and flight attendants were generally friendly. We liked the bottomless wine and self-service snacks. Check-in process in Rome was bad waited in line for almost 90 minutes to check in which was frustrating. At the gate no organization at all. They just open the gate and it's a cattle call to squeeze onto the plane. Experience was better that expected.

### Alitalia customer review
BOS-FCO FCO-BOS - Outbound we were assigned vegetarian meals (whether through our error or theirs I can't say). I didn't eat the dinner but for breakfast we were served a single rice cake and a few pieces of cut fruit! On the return flight they messed up our seat reservations (made 5 months in advance) not once but twice for the same flight. The crew's passenger list showed no seat assignments for us so we got two middle seats next to the loos. On both trips the planes were dirty. The carpets were filthy. The loos looked clapped- out with bits of paper stuck around the walls. Do they ever clean these planes? Pros: The crew were polite.

Heathrow to Bari via Linate return. The Alitalia experience within Europe has been improving consistently. Sad to see the end of the MD80s but the new fleet is good and clean service is fine and all flights were on time or early. Online booking is easy as is online check in though this is not yet available when with under 12s from Italy.

YYZ-FCO 09/09/2012. Pros: great flight crew. Strangely it was an all-boys crew however they did their best to accommodate passengers’ needs. Level of attentiveness was very good and they were ready to smile and to answer any question. Pros: thinking AZ was a Star Alliance member I would have expected better standards. B763 was truly worn out even if it sported Star Alliance’ s logo. No PTV (almost acceptable) but the monitor close to my seat was shut off. The trim of the overhead bins across from my aisle was missing leaving a “raw” piece of airplane in plain sight. Throughout the night when the cabin lights were shut off the reading lights of my row were going off at once giving a sort of flashing / disco effect to the cabin. Although it was 09/09 the in-flight magazines were the ones of the previous month. The light brown economy seat I was in showed large dark spots although it felt slightly wider than regular economy seats and (a little bit) softer.

### Alitalia customer review
We flew to Rome from Toronto. The seats were very uncomfortable. The television monitors were the old style down the centre and far apart and showing a movie with English subtitles. Our return flight was no better I'd say it was worse. The boarding was a free for all no help for seniors or folks with little ones. They started to load from the front then opened the back doors so you had folks trying to squeeze past each other in the aisles with luggage while others were stowing belongings - it was chaos. Our seats were dirty stained and torn fabric pockets were ripped. The meal - dried out and cold pasta that they called a lasagne. Needless to say never again.

### Alitalia customer review
I fly to MXP or LIN often from London and have to say Alitalia have one of the youngest fleets in Europe. Planes are spotless (unlike UK counterparts) and the service is always top class including the food. It's such a refreshing change from 5/6 years ago!

Milan-NY JFK - I recently flew A330 from Milan to New York JFK in economy class and the flight was extremely good. The plane was clean and brand new the seats very spacious and comfortable. Most importantly the in-flight entertainment was the best I have ever had in economy on any airline. The screen is very large and the selection of movies is very impressive. Food was better than most economy flights as well. They even gave us ice cream mid-flight and plenty of drinks. Very nice touches. Overall this was the best economy class flight I have ever taken. Alitalia has improved so much they deserve a new reputation now.

### Alitalia customer review
JFK-Rome FCO. A330 New York to Rome in Premium Economy a new class Alitalia just launched. The flight was amazing. Plane was new and clean and the Premium Economy has a separate cabin that is spacious and very nice. We received a welcome glass of Prosecco and snacks which was a very nice touch. The seats were very comfortable and the entertainment system was amazing. The screen is very large by any standards (bigger than in most business class seats) and the choice of movies was impressive in many languages. The food could be improved for sure and the service still has some way to go but overall the new Alitalia is much better than before.

### Alitalia customer review
We flew Toronto to Rome and on to Rimini. Our experience with Alitalia was terrible. We were delayed by 5 hours leaving Toronto which resulted in a 9 hour layover in Rome. This turned into a 12 hour layover as our flight was delayed. We were given no information about how the delay would impact our connection and were sent from desk to desk to speak with various staff who were rude and couldn't (or wouldn't help). Since we had been awake for over 30 hours without our baggage we asked staff for toiletries so that we could wash and brush our teeth. Staff were rude and unsympathetic.

Sep 7 LAX-PMO (via FCO) return on Sep 17. Impressive service longhaul from LAX-FCO (and back) on clean newer 777 professional attentive and neat crew that served 2 meals and a snack efficiently. Between services crew visible and readily available to assist. Left LAX late but made up time easy connection to PMO. FCO is sprawled out and walking between intl and domestic terminal long-not for the out-of-shape. Boarding area for return FCO-LAX was a fiasco-no delineated queues difficult to understand overhead announcements- in either English or Italian. Would recommend Alitalia!

### Alitalia customer review
Flew from Toronto to Rome and back. Boarding in Toronto was chaotic there was no process to board back of the plane first then middle then front. It was a free-for all. Staff remained at back of plane for entire flight except when serving beverages then meals. No water or snacks in between meals. The planes were old - in fact had ashtrays in the arm rests. TV's were the old fashioned shared versions. Movie on the way over was pathetic. One of two movies on way back was good. Cold air was blowing the entire time from Rome to Toronto with no way to adjust air flow. I will not fly Alitalia again.

### Alitalia customer review
Flight from Toronto to Rome and then connecting from Rome to Milan. Our flight was late leaving Toronto by 45 minutes actually 1 hour by the time we left the runway. During the flight the crew were inattentive and somewhat rude. They appeared only when serving drinks and meals and disappeared during the remainder of the flight. Passengers had to go and get their own drinks after service was completed. Lots of spills as passengers walked from the back of the plane with their drinks. The continental breakfast was pathetic offering 2 Oreo cookies along with yoghurt and a soggy pastry inside a cellophane wrapper. When we landed there was no fast tracking provided for us at the passport control and we had only half an hour to get through before our connecting flight. It was no surprise that we missed the connection as it was in the other terminal. We were issued another boarding pass and had to wait another 2 hours for the next flight. That flight too was late leaving. We will never fly Alitalia again. Service is unreliable flight crew are indifferent and the washroom facilities during the flight are deplorable.

My husband and I recently took a code share flight with Delta on Alitalia from Chicago to Rome. Flight #'s 629 ORD-FCO and 628 from FCO-ORD. Both flights were pretty much on time and boarding was a very organized way of doing things. The organization from Rome was a fiasco. There were not enough seats in the terminal at the gate causing everyone to crowd around the desk. It was impossible to see where we were to enter the process of boarding other than the blue carpet for the honorary fliers. This caused a huge crush when rows were called. It was chaos. The service on the plane was ok however the food was totally inedible. The snack on the return flight was tasteless. There were no air vents at the seats and the lighting on the sides of the airplane was out in many areas. The bathrooms were not in good repair and the TP ran out early although it was replenished at some point. The monitors were very far apart. If you weren't sitting in a seat close to one it was impossible to watch the programs.

Rome - Moscow A320. Good flight good food for lunch and good crew. Would definitely use again for short haul flights.

### Alitalia customer review
Both onward and return journey were delayed by 1 hour. On arrival at Rome airport there was no transit assistance offered as connecting flight to Bari was due to take off in 20 minutes. Security personnel in transit area not helpful and won't give fast track access when explained that we will miss our connecting flight if we join the long endless queue. Tried to speak to an Alitalia stewardess who totally ignore our calls for help. Finally we had to exit the terminal and walk to the departure terminal security and passport control run to the Gate number on our boarding pass and realised that they have made a late change to Gate number. Luckily the flight to Bari was also delayed and we didn't miss the flight. We didn't need to have this hassle if there was Alitalia attendant at hand to assist people on connecting flights.

Booked flight from JFK to Reggio Calabria with a stop in Rome. Flight left JFK over an hour late for no apparent reason other than waiting for late passengers. We originally would have 70 minutes to transfer in Rome. Because we left late we only had 30 minutes. My son and I ran to get to our gate and were able to arrive with 10 minutes to spare only to be told that our baggage will not make the transfer and we were not allowed to board without our baggage. We had to wait 4 hours for the next flight at 5.15 which did not board until after 5.20. Coming home was not any better. Flight from Reggio Calabria to Rome left over 30 minutes late and the flight from Rome back to JFK left over 20 minutes late. The only flight on time seemed to be the one that we were not allowed to be on.

### Alitalia customer review
First experience of split flights - stop overs in FCO on way out and LIN on way back (LHR-CAT return). Booking flights only possible via Expedia (avoid) - simply did not show up on Alitalia website which also not good for non-Italian speakers. On line check in a delight. Ground staff not great - on way back told we were too early for check-in. Main problem was both initial flights were delayed an hour taking off and connection times were tight causing anxiety. In the event pilots radioed ahead flights were connected with and baggage no problem. Be aware there is no food on Millemiglia flights.

This was my first time flying with them to Milan. The lounge at JFK was the smallest I've ever been to and unfortunately the amenities was minimal there and forget using the toilet I swear the toilets at Penn station was cleaner. I didn't think this flight experience was going to be better but I was very impressed with the level of efficiency it took the crew to help everyone to their seats and the flight took off on time. Service was excellent and the food was impressive for airline food. The new Magnifica cabin was clean and spacious. The new pods were very comfortable and each seat has a massager and sleeps flat. Suffice to say we were well pampered from beginning till the end of our flight which arrived 45 mins early.

FCO-LAX in business Magnifica Class. Fast check-in good service in Alitalia Lounge in Terminal 3 (FCO) priority access to the recently refurbished B772.

Aug 16 Boston - Rome FCO AZ 615 departure 5.10 pm. First stood 1 hour at the gate due to mechanical issues. After we finally took off the pilot informed us the landing gear was malfunctioning and after a fuel dump we would return to Boston. After an hour of circling above the greater Boston area he informed us to divert to New York JFK. No information yet. Three hours after initial departure we made and emergency landing at JFK. They kept us in the plane for an other hour let us wait for our luggage and let us stand in line form more then 3 hours to get hotel vouchers and rebooking to other flight. No drinks or beverages provided staff very unfriendly and uncoordinated.

Clean airplane even with small TV screen in each seat (size of IPhone but working!). Nice smiling cabin crew reacting on cabin calls.

Wife and daughter were booked on Alitalia Flight 615 at 5.10 pm tonight from Boston to Rome. Alitalia boarded them waited an hour cancelled the flight for mechanical issues promised a new plane broke the promise made them wait 2 hours for their luggage and then put them in a line of hundreds of people to rebook. Alitalia 800 number refused to help - which guaranteed their passengers would almost all miss tonight's later flights to Europe.

Barcelona to Rome then connecting from Rome to Miami. We had reservations for the Classica Plus class seats on the Rome-Miami leg. In Barcelona they attempted to print our boarding passes for the second leg of the flight but were unable to after having us wait for over an hour while they attempted to do so. Apparently the original plane was switched to an aircraft without the Classica Plus section. Never informed of this change and apparently neither was the check-in desk in Spain. In Barcelona we were told to report directly to the gate in Rome where they would have our boarding passes. After racing through the airport in Rome and arriving at the gate we were told there was no Classica Plus on this aircraft. Rather than upgrade us to business class we were downgraded to economy class with four seats in the centre of the plane. We were told to go to the ticketing desk in Miami when we landed for a refund of the overcharge. In addition to the downgrade to economy class my reservation for a gluten-free meal was lost leaving me unable to eat most of the food available on the flight. When we finally landed two of our bags were missing. We were then told they were left in Rome. They were delivered late the next evening. We had to then wait at the ticketing desk for our refund. We are still awaiting a refund for the overcharge for economy class.

The flight from Rome to Toronto 14 June was the worst flight I have experienced. Flight attendants were rude and inattentive. Most of them remained in the rear of the plane socializing. They failed to maintain even a semblance of cleanliness in the restrooms which by the flight's conclusion were filthy. The floors were strewn with wet paper towels the trash receptacle was overflowing and the sinks were clogged. Furthermore the seats had little or no padding some were actually repaired with masking tape. Only centre consoles were available for entertainment. A miserable experience.

Flew from JFK to Palermo with a connection in Rome and from Catania to JFK connecting in Rome again. We had a two-hour delay sitting on the tarmac at JFK with NO information. Obviously missed our connection in Rome and were hustled off to a later connecting flight again with no information. On the return trip we again had a tight connection so our bags did not make it to JFK - and they weren't delivered to us for two more days. Flight attendants were rude and/or preoccupied. Food was inedible. I'll never fly Alitalia again.

We booked a flight from New York City to Rome and Delta airlines farmed us out to Alitalia. We checked in online the night before our return trip and arrived at the airport 2 1/2 hours early for our flight. Only to be told the flight was overbooked and they gave our seats away. They were very rude and would not even try to explain why they gave our seats away. We were just told to go rebook. We went to that counter and they said they got us rebooked on another flight through Delta. We went to that terminal only to be told the ticket we had was for standby only as their flight was full as well. Alitalia did not care and just wanted to push us off to someone else. Delta were very professional and we're able to get us on a flight home. I will never travel by Alitalia again.

LHR-FCO-GIG-FCO-LHR. Really nice surprise at London Heathrow flying on A321 with old Alitalia livery. Service onboard very professional with an excellent hot snack (omelette and salmon) for a duration of 2.5h. Transfer at Rome Fiumicino painless using fast track lane and the airport has lots of shops and restaurants. The Alitalia Giotto lounge was packed but the drinks selection was fine as well as the variety of sandwiches. Boarding A330 to Rio quick using Sky Priority lane. The aircraft had the new Magnifica Class with a 1-2-1 configuration. It was half full. Plenty of space in overhead lockers however if you seat in the middle there are none and have to use the ones on the side. Pre-taking off drinks given great selection of appetizers and the best moment was the food. Alitalia won best Airline Food recently and I was very much looking forward to it. Succulent Beef with Roasted Mediterranean vegetables as main course and for dessert a light unctuous Neapolitan Almond Cake. A 5 stars food and the espresso is served in a very beautiful cup and lid. The IFE had a good variety of recent movies but I thought the international selection was lacking. They have Flat beds (Only Skyteam airline in Europe to have these) and managed a good 7h sleep with a very comfortable duvet. The amenities given were a Bulgari bag with lots of toiletries products very much appreciated and high class. Staff very professional smiling and very happy to go for the extra mile for the customers. Breakfast consisted of a selection of Italian pastries and cakes with fresh fruits excellent! On the return leg Alitalia uses Air France/KLM lounge that can be cramped at times but it has great selection of hot snacks (the palm tree heart quiches are gorgeous). Boarding the A330 was painless again and the Magnifica class was full this time. Despite taking off 1h later we managed to catch up 30 minutes. The amenities given was another Bulgari bag and the best highlight was the food again with Pork Milanese as main course. Slept a good 7hours and had a copious breakfast before landing in Rome. The A321 to London was on time and service very good again. Overall a good value for money their new Magnifica class is an excellent product their Flat beds very comfortable and it's the Best Food I've ever had on an airline. Would recommend to anyone trying their new Business class either for professional purpose or leisure. Will definitely fly again with Alitalia on the lines featuring the new Magnifica Class.

Nothing seems to have changed since privatisation. Apart from the fact that prices have gone up and a meal is no longer offered including on 3 hours from London to Rome. Check-in staff rude at London Thessaloniki and Rome. Asked to check in an extra bag due to a medical condition and still within the baggage limitations but was asked to pay 40 euros. Flight was only half full. Also very difficult to find the gate for the connecting flight. Crew were only friendly on leg Rome-Thessaloniki and there doesn't seem to be consistency with the service. Only Italian customers seem to get asked whether they want sweet or savoury biscuits. Otherwise they don't even greet when you board and seem preoccupied with their own chat. London to Rome half an hour late without an announcement or apology. There was a customer satisfaction survey on board between Rome and London but only a hand-full of people were picked not sure according to what criteria.

MIA-MXP on a new A330 traveling with my wife and infant son. We were greeted by a very nice staff member in Miami who gave us comfortable front row seats with a baby bassinet. Flight staff were courteous and professional. Food was average but not bad and with good portions. An open bar with snacks and beverages was at present for the entire flight and cabin attendants passed offering water frequently. The IFE system is one of the best I’ve seen in an airline – dozens of films games and TV shows in a 9 inch touch-screen and in many different languages.

LIN-FCO-IST-FCO-LIN. Check-in at Linate was done over the phone so I just had to pick my boarding pass at the counter. Polite staff at the gate changed my seat on the FCO-IST to a better selection. LIN-FCO was a great flight everything smooth and good service. Flight to IST was terrible rude staff and poor food availability. Only a cookie for a 2 hr international flight. Return flight was even worse rude flight attendant and very unhelpful. Service still below standards and lacking. FCO-LIN was a delight compared to the previous flight. Flight crew was totally on another level making the flight enjoyable. No consistency on this airline and should also focus not only on their major route between Milan and Rome.

We have just travelled from Rome to Barcelona and paid £845 for two business class seats. We had just finished a cruise and had a lot of luggage and we didn't want hassle with excess luggage costs etc. There were 3 people including us in business. Although there were 3 stewardess's we were not greeted at all. 20 minutes into this short flight we still had not seen a stewardess so I rang the button and asked for a drink. My wife asked for a G and T and I asked for a glass of Champagne. No gin no vodka and needless to say no Champagne. The White wine offered was warm and undrinkable. The food was terrible too. After serving the food we didn't see the stewardesses again. They shut the curtain and spent the rest of the flight chatting.
