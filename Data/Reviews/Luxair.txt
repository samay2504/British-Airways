### "told me it was too late"
This time I bookend my flight from Luxembourg to Rome, of course they were late by 45 mins on departure. I checked in, did security checks and arrived on the gate indicated in the boarding pass and on the big screens. I waited there, and last minute they changed the gate to the other side of the airport. No message or email. I got up and went to check the big screen and realized they changed the Gate. I ran to the new gate and I found two very rude ladies that told me it was too late and it was my fault for now being constantly looking at the screens. They told me to go to the Luxair help desk, the lady said she could not do anything as I had the economy fare. This is the worst quality airline.

### "very messy travel company"
Not Verified | From the best airline to the worst! My first experience on 22nd November 2024 began with a waiting queue in front of security checks, which were only half staffed, resulting in a wait of over 30 minutes. Next, the plane was delayed from 18:15 to 19:15. Then, suddenly, no information was provided— the plane disappeared from the electronic board, and there were no announcements on the loudspeakers. I received a message on my phone stating the flight had been modified, with a recommendation to check my emails. A new flight was suggested for the next evening, extending the travel time to more than double via Vienna to Copenhagen, making it impossible for the planned trip. I am now left with a refund from Luxair, but what about all the costs associated with the cancellation of the hotel and rental car, which exceed the refund amount? Just a very messy travel company, and my experience confirms what happened recently on a flight from Copenhagen to Luxembourg.

### "It’s just the worst"
The worst of it all. I been traveling the past year every 2 weeks Luxembourg Portugal and back. And it’s the same story all the time 35 minutes late. 1 hour late. It’s just the worst. And uni there’s no other way to travel fast. By car it takes one full day. Other wise I would never step foot on those planes. No respect for the customer what so ever.

### "not customer obsessed"
I have never complained about Luxair although I would have many reasons. I am travelling a lot with this airline and now I have had enough! My flight from London has been cancelled (it happened already 80% of cases) and despite there was an earlier flight they rebooked me on the latest! I asked why some people were rebooked in the earlier but they said was random! That is not true! One BIL employee has been rebooked on the earliest flight and it is not by chance! You are not customer obsessed you are one of the most terrible airline companies.

### "Low cost service at premium prices"
Not Verified |  Low cost service at premium prices. My partner was told he must pay to check in a regular weekend cabin bag that has never been rejected on any other airline in many years of travel. On top of that they were rude and dismissive and almost jubilant at the prospect of him having to pay more money on top of the extortionate airfare.

### "Bad experience and rude attitude"
Luxair  - very poor quality of service - I paid for an upfront seat, and even though I made the check-in and had the seat assigned together with my husband, it was changed ‘by hazard by the system’ 5 minutes before flying. The staff was rude, without offering any solution, saying that if I do not accept the seat, I cannot travel. Bad experience and rude attitude, not a recommended airline.

### "I was impressed"
The flight took off and landed on time, boarding was efficient and the crew were friendly. I have no complaints. I ignored an offered opportunity to upgrade to business class, but did take up the chance to block off the next seat for £45, which was great. So often, I have watched Luxair planes at London City and wondered how the flights would be. Turns out, I was impressed.

### "they won’t give me my money back"
Not Verified |  Worst experience with a flight company. First, they didn’t inform me about overbooking and late flight. I’ve waited for 5 hours in the airport due to their late flight and when I was about to embark, I was refused to do so because my ticket was not valid. Afterwards, I found out they scheduled me for another flight due to overbooking, which I had no idea about. Second, it’s been already 3 months since I was supposed to travel to Luxembourg and they won’t give me my money back. Customer service is also very disappointing, I have the feeling that I speak with robots not humans. No matter what I am trying to explain to them, they’ll tell me the same nonsense and excuses for me not receiving the refund.

### "Very bad customer service"
Not Verified |  LuxAir, the cheap Airline that charges prices of premium airlines. They are expert breaking luggages. I flew a couple of times with them, expecting their service would be top quality, according to their ticket’s price. Wrong! Very bad customer service, cheap and low quality meals.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience. Luxair used to be one of the better companies to fly with. Even though they are slightly more expensive, you could be sure to receive adequate service and food included with your trip.in recent times the planes have gotten more and more late and the personnel does not seem to care to communicate with people anymore. My most recent flight they decided without communicating with us, to leave some luggage behind at London City Airport and leave. However, before boarding I heard the lady at the boarding picking up the phone and saying "oh no". I guess she knew, but was too afraid to tell people about their personal belongings not being included in the flight. We were never informed had, we not gone to the lost luggage counter at our destination airport. Then at the counter of the destination airport they promised us, thst our luggage would be coming the following day. We have been waiting for them to get in contact with us, and have been stuck on hold on their service line for 2 Hours. How is this even acceptable. We have no reassurance about our luggage. If we check their luggage tracing page is even says that our luggage has not been localized, how come? Is it no even save and secured at their airport and where even could it be?

### "Its not comfortable. Ryanair standards"
First very expensive, then the plane small and dirty. 30 min delay at 6 in the morning without any information, when asking: "the cabin crew is not there" (sleeping?) Funny food, that's not food, more plastic than something to eat. Do they really think that the client could be happy paying that much and flying in this tiny plane with this service? Its not comfortable. Ryanair standards.

### "better off with budget airline"
Flight cancellation was so last minute despite weather forecast prediction hours in advance. No compensation. A poor hotel service was provided for overnight stay but it was in the middle of nowhere with no food nor drink provided. Functioned more like a budget airline with subpar standard. Staffs were incompetent, could not clarify questions but had full mastery of not taking any position to help customers while providing us with "he says she says" answers. Generally very good at pushing responsibility to customers. Luxair does not provide "Fragile" tag for baggage. Again, the risk is all on the customers. Branded as an international airport, the staffs were poor or broken in English. For the price, anyone would be better off with budget airline.

### "All in all a great airline"
I'm flying a few times a year with Luxair and I really like them. The prices are usually good, including check-in luggage up to 23kg as well as drinks and snacks on short flights. The service is great, they were really helpful with various issues due to the pandemics, the staff at airports and on board is friendly. Their planes for short flights tend to be small, I most often fly from Berlin to Luxembourg and back on small planes with two rows of 2. When the flights are not completely booked, you can have the option to book the seat next to you for a fee during check-in. As a large person, I used it a couple of times, it reduces the stress a lot. All in all a great airline.

### "I have never received my luggage"
What an unpleasant experience. I traveled with Luxair on the 14th of July and till today 30th of October, I have never received my luggage or received any compensation. I think I have been so patient and you guys don't seem to care. This is very careless. It was my first time traveling with this airline and the last time. U

### "Absolute shambolic excuse"
Not Verified | London City to Luxembourg. Absolute shambolic excuse for customer service. I boarded a flight from London City airport to Luxembourg on 08/04/22. I paid for the luggage to be transferred. When I arrived in Luxembourg to my surprise my luggage had not. I informed luggage assistance at the airport, and we logged the report, but the information provided was nonexistent (log your details, and we'll get back to you when we hear something). I called Luxair a few hours later with my reference and was informed that my luggage would be on the 6pm flight and someone would contact me. At 7.15pm I received a call from the rudest so-called customer service I have had the displeasure to encounter. He asked me whether I would like my luggage delivered I which I agreed when I stated the postcode he refused. He said no you better come and collect it if you need it. My argument is that I paid for a service that was not delivered. At this, he hung up on me. If this is the type of customer service training you provide your staff it needs to be reviewed. My weekend in Germany with my partner's family is being interrupted as I now need to drive to Luxembourg to pick up my luggage for a mistake you made.

### "Worst airline ever"
I booked a flight LUX-DUB, which was cancelled. As an alternative, I was offered LUX-Paris with Luxair and Paris-Dublin with Aer Lingus. When I arrived at the airport Luxair told me after the check-in and (extra-) baggage-drop, that I was not checked in for the second flight and that my luggage was just paid until Paris. I would thus have to get my luggage, get out of Charles de Gaulle, go through security again and drop my luggage again while having to pay for it a second time. Since I did not have time to do so until my connecting flight, the Luxair staff recommended simply booking the next flight out of Paris for 400€ on top. I thus booked a direct flight from Ryanair, cancelled my luggage and asked for the money to be returned. Not only don't they return the 550€ for the flights, they don't even give me back the 75€ I paid for the extra luggage. Worst airline ever.

### "Horrible experience with Luxair"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience with Luxair. We were stranded in Madrid for 3 days due to weather conditions. Luxair told passengers to find their own accommodation and get reimbursed from the company. We flew in January, now it's the end of April and still no answer from Luxair. We made several phone calls, sent emails. Every time we start from zero with incompetent people at their customer support and still no refund! It's a shame for this company.

### "They lost my bag!"
Not Verified |  They lost my bag! I flew from London city airport to Paris with a layover in Luxembourg and when I arrived at Paris mine never showed up. I submitted a claim to try and resolve it but that turned out to be a waste of energy. Worst part is that their baggage line doesn’t open until 3 and only stays open until 5. Really unbelievable, I came here to see Disney land and now I have to go find a whole new wardrobe and everything. Would not recommend this airline.

### "Very nice staff"
Luxembourg to Copenhagen. Very nice staff, they were helpful and smiling. We received a sandwich, which is rare nowadays. It was a pleasure! I will for sure fly again with them.

### "this flight went very smoothly"
As always, this flight went very smoothly. The flight departed on time, a very modern plane (LX-LBB), the breakfast on board was, although smaller than in previous years, very tasty. The crew were very professional but as always, not a single English announcements. I hope it is only for me, but this really annoys me. Spanish announcements should be introduced as for LG flights to Madrid or Barcelona. On board Wifi would be more than welcome and miles should be earned on this route.

### "a complete lack of English announcements on board"
Malaga to Luxembourg with Luxair. The ticket was quite expensive when booked (around 300€ booked 3 weeks ago). The cabin was full but the flight went smoothly and on time. LG is among the last legacy carriers providing a meal on their “medium-long” flights. Nevertheless, a hot meal instead of a cold one would be preferred in this case. The cabin crew was professional but not exceptional. As I said previously, there was a complete lack of English announcements on board. This is simply unacceptable. Additionally, Spanish announcements would be a nice touch too. Nevertheless, it seems like Luxair doesn’t really care about this issue. No invitation for the web check-in and no miles can be earned on the LUX-AGP/AGP-LUX routes. Yet again, something unacceptable. On board Wi-Fi would be welcome as well as the CO2 compensation on their website.

### "Lousy airline"
Luxembourg to Venice. Lousy airline, first overbooking for a confirmed ticket, then absence of information on a problematic situation and incompetence and bad faith to find a solution.

### "Nice and smooth flight"
Luxembourg to Faro. Nice and smooth flight, In contrast to LG flights from Faro, online check-in is available on flight to Faro. Crew was friendly and catering was good. However, again, the lack of English and Portuguese announcements is really unpleasant for passengers who don’t speak the 3 national languages of Luxembourg. To improve immediately.

### "Very good flight"
Faro to Luxembourg. Very good flight, even though there’s some negative points. No online check-in available from Faro (but it is available when flights are departing from LUX). LG should maybe start considering installing wifi on board it’s planes. One of the biggest critic I could make though i’d the lack of any English and Portuguese announcements made by the crew during the entire flight. This is really not acceptable for a legacy company such as Luxair. Nevertheless the flight itself was smooth, the catering was good (and existing!) and the crew was very friendly, despite not making EN and PT annoucements. I still would highly recommend Luxair, but please LG, correct these basic mistakes!

### "never fly with Luxair again! "
Not Verified |  Berlin to Luxembourg. On the 30th of November my Luxair flight was 3 Hours delayed which due to the EU passenger regulation (EG) Nr. 261/2004 entitles me to a 250€ compensation. I emailed the customer service and they claim that "the flight was only delayed 2 hrs 59 Minutes". I was on the plane and it did not leave after 2 hours 59 minutes - we were still on the ground. I will never fly with Luxair again!

### "I didn't receive my luggage"
Luxembourg to Lisbon. On arrival I didn't receive my luggage. And I received no information on the whereabouts of my luggage for 3 days. The flight duration is less than 3 hours. I was forced to buy new clothes and toiletries since my situation was precarious. I don't understand how a luggage can be lost on a direct flight of less than 3 hours duration. When I received my luggage 3 days later, I was horrified by the condition of my Luggage. My Luggage was left opened and exposed for several days and was left damaged, not being able to close completely. I was missing a white shirt and tooth brush. My luggage was searched extensively and they could not put back my affairs correctly in the right order. And could not close my luggage. No information was provided to me during these 3 days to inform me that my luggage will be opened and will be treated so horribly. The way my luggage was treated is simply not respectful of a customer. I started my Christmas holiday in an horrible way with this horrible incident. And they did not seem to be concerned at all. They never called me. they didn't put any effort on finding my luggage quickly. Very bad after service customer interaction.

### "quality of service drop significantly"
Munich to Luxemburg. I have been flying a lot using Luxair in the last 10 years. The quality of service drop significantly in my view in the last years especially compared to the prices which remains higher than the average. Notwithstanding the above, the customer care and the communication is really terrible and poor. Recently (5th September 2018) my Luxair flight from Luxemburg to Munich was cancelled. I was travelling for business. I discovered that my flight was cancelled when I arrived at the airport where I was rebook on a Lufthansa flight. It can happen. What it must not happen is that the same airlines which has cancelled the flight and caused you the inconvenience, is refusing to grant access to their lounge (I am usually allowed to) because of no refund from Lufthansa. I prayed the responsible to help me as I had to work and I had some tough deadlines to respect and the fact that my flight was delayed cause me some problems. They simply refused... they also refused to allow me to talk to a supervisor... I call then directly Luxair... they told me to contact the Luxair personnel. I then wrote a complain to the airline, no answer after almost 2 weeks. If a flight was cancelled, not because of customer care, but just because of the normal rules, the airline shall treat the affected passengers with duly care. Is this the care? No time to listen to the problems of their customers (cause by the cancellation of their flight) and help them (just granting access to the lounge, nothing special). No answer to any complain and communications.

### "great value for money"
Faro to Luxembourg. Web check-in is not available for LG flights departing from FAO. This makes check-in at the airport very long as everyone is required to go to the registration desks (there’s no self check-in machines for Luxair at Faro airport neither). Ground announcements for boarding were only made in French. Some Portuguese passengers had to ask the Portway handling crew to clarify what was going on as the 3 different groups were called for boarding, each at different times. Same for the flight and same thing as always; there’s a lack of English announcements, and even Portuguese announcements (even though all LG flights to LİS and OPO have them; not sure about Madeira flights though). The crew was of Portuguese decent but all announcements were made in LU, FR and DE. This is truly not acceptable for a legacy airline. The meal served on board was good, although the quantity was pretty small. A hot meal would be more than welcome instead of a cold one. Clean plane and cabin, enough legroom available and flight on time (the plane arrived in LUX ten minutes ahead of the schedule). Luxair remains a great value for money (although there’s a lack of Miles and more earning on this route! ), but it must correct those mistakes to keep its image.

### "offers great value for money"
Luxembourg to Faro. Luxair offers a great value for money. Although the ticket was quite expensive, the quality on board remains high. Things have changed with years and the quantity of the of the breakfast served on board is very small compared to what it used to be. Another fact to underline as for other LG destinations, the LACK OF ENGLİSH announcerments (there was a few American passengers onboard who did not sparks any of the 3 official languages of Luxembourg) and also Portuguese. This is just unacceptable for a flag carrier such as Luxair and knowing that Portugal is the second biggest market for the airlines after the UK. Still no miles on this routes either.

### "I don't recommend Luxair"
Nice to Luxembourg. I have been flying with Luxair for over a year, almost every week end. Overall, I find the quality/price ratio  very poor: low cost service at premium price. The staff is quite unfriendly and inflexible. I have now found alternative carriers and stopped using Luxair. I don't recommend Luxair.

### "Flight was 2 hours late"
Flew Dublin to Faro. Flight was 2 hours late. When I looked at times for the week they were all delayed. Luxair need to advertised their flights at later times because it is ignorant of them to routinely/regularly have delayed flights.

### "Very pleasant flight"
Very pleasant flight from Málaga to Luxembourg, but with the same “small mistakes” as viewed during previous Luxair flights on this route. No English announcements from the cabin crew, no pre-recorded Spanish announcements (as done on flights to MAD and BCN) and also, a bigger importance given to passengers travelling with the Flight+Hotel pack. No Luxair, not all passengers are using this route for holiday purposes. But appart from those small negative points, the biggest drawback will be (again) the lack of miles earning on the Miles & More program on the AGP-LUX route. Just, why? For the rest, as mentioned above, everything was very pleasant. Tasty breakfast, departure on time, friendly cabin crew, and a quite and modern plane.

### "poor customer service"
Flew Paris CDG to Luxembourg. Bad service, unfriendly staff, poor baggage claim service (closes at 7pm) and poor customer service. This company benefit from the fact that if people have to travel long distance they will end up on a Luxair flight code sharing with the company they chose. This is really irritating since Luxair is a terrible company with poor services.

### "flight was satisfactory"
Flew Luxembourg to Malaga. Overall, the flight was satisfactory but with some disappointing points throughout the flight. The lack of English announcements is unforgivable for a legacy carrier as LG. Pre-recorderded or real Spanish announecements should also be displayed for Málaga (as they are on flights to MAD and BCN) knowing that there is a small but strong Spanish community flying regularly on this route. The lack of miles earning in the “Basic” fare is also not understanble from the passanger point of view. The introduction of onboard Wi-Fi would be more than welcome. Therefore, the avaibility of the online check-in for this route has made the flight experience much more enjoyable and practical. Clean cabin, friendly cabin crew, modern plane and flight on time.

### "fabulous cabin staff"
Luxembourg to London City. Excellent airline with fabulous cabin staff. Really impressed with the full service that you now don't get on airlines like BA. Old school service with sweets handed out before landing. I highly recommend people from London needing to get to Luxembourg to use Luxair from City Airport. Absolutely well worth it. Our flight was bang on time and the check in was also seamless with a lovely check on agent.

### "Staff was very rude"
Faro to Luxembourg. Staff was very rude, we had to ask 4 times to bring us water for our toddler, and finally we got it with comment, "sorry, but I am alone and I have service to finish! (there were 4 flight assistants on the board). After finishing snack they haven't picked up the meal tray for more than an hour, when we asked them 'can you remove this, we don't have space with the toddler on the lap' they were irritated and said "this is not the way to talk to us" . They seemed friendly with passengers without kids but very intolerant and unhelpful with passengers with babies or toddlers. We will avoid traveling with Luxair because of this reason. Very disappointed. When traveling to Faro the flight was dealyed by 3 hours.

### "was a positive experience"
The flight from Paris CDG to Luxembourg departed on time and arrived earlier than scheduled. Service on board was very good on this short flight. A small snack and water were served. The flight was quite bumpy as its a small aircraft but there is nothing the airline can do about turbulence. My only complaint is that the flight departs from CDG T2G which offers very few options for shopping and dining. Overall, this was a positive experience and I would happily recommend Luxair.

### "service has decreased with the years"
Flew Luxair from Luxembourg to Malpensa. Expensive airline, sold as "all inclusive" but service has decreased with the years, now you get half a sandwich instead of a full one. Cabin crew far too young and inexperienced. Those Bombardier are small planes, shaky and noisy which means you are unable to have a conversation with your neighbor or have a nap. Ground service: no comment as they are rude. I afterwards flew easyJet, and I highly recommend them as luggage and ticket were half price.

### "we got a decent deal"
Excellent airline who always treat customers well. Luxair are the only direct way for getting from Ireland to Luxembourg (alternative being to fly Ryanair to Hahn or Charleroi and get a 90 minute bus). A few years ago this flight used to stop off in Manchester to pick up more passengers, but luckily that is no longer the case. The only drawback with Luxair is the premium price you pretty much always have to pay. If you see a bargain price, book it. On this particular flight, we got a decent deal. Checked baggage always free, food very nice (so fresh! ), lovely aircraft in which you get immediately know this is a premium airline (leather seats, small plane, roomy). Luxembourg airport doesn’t have much going on, but still nice and easy to get through. If Ryanair or Aer Lingus decide to fly the route, it will provide stiff competition. Hopefully Luxair will fight back and not run away from the route.

### "certainly a full service airline"
Loved the convenience of flying out of LCY. For just a one hour flight, we were given a snack (a delicious salami and salad roll on very fresh bread), wine, coffee and a face wipe. Just before landing we were given a Belgian chocolate. The aircraft was small and rather cramped, but I realise that larger aeroplanes may not be able to land at LCY. Luxair is certainly a full service airline, offering the high standard of service that flying used to provide.

### "old school in excellent way"
Stockholm to Luxembourg. Definitely old school but in an excellent way. Even in economy you got offered a choice of a cheese salad or salami sandwich and champagne/drinks. Service was excellent from check in through on board service. My only quibble that as a member of Star Alliance, Luxair should be able to credit my points through SAS. However, despite the check in clerk trying his best you're stuck with Lufthansa's Miles and More program. The 2 hour 30 minute flight on a commuter prop plane (Q400) is probably stretching the envelope in terms of comfort but the stewards did everything to make your life pleasant, prices are good if all your legs are with Luxair. They go up steeply if you have to take a connecting flight with another Star Alliance member. A nice touch is the meet your luggage at the steps of the aircraft (mandatory for an aircraft this size). Expect to be bussed into the terminal for the turbo props at Luxembourg Airport.

### "good flight for US$150"
Luxembourg to Madrid on Boeing 737-800 in Economy. Check in easy, no line and friendly agent. No line at security and into the gate area with plenty of seats. Not much choice for food (one restaurant with snacks). Around 80% full cabin, friendly attendants welcome on board in English/French/Luxembourgese. Departed 15 min late due to baggage loading. Good flight overall, just over 2 hours and served a snack and drinks. They had some entertainment on the drop-down screens but I was watching my own Ipad. Flight-map would pop up here and there to let us know where we were. Landed in Madrid at T4 and bags were out pretty fast. A good flight for US$150.

### "Dash 8 is not the best"
Luxair serves sandwiches and even champagne to economy passengers and for reasonable prices. However, since they replaced many of their jets with noisy propeller-aircraft, flying-times have become a lot longer and the comfort of their Dash 8 is not the best. On my recent flight from ARN to LUX that was three hours long (normally it takes only 2 hours and 10 minutes) they had only one drink-run which is poor for such a long flight. Seating was cramped (Dash-standard) and there was no onboard entertainment. For me, the slightly better service does not outweigh much longer flight times and this is why I will tend to consider other airlines into FRA again in the future.

### Luxair customer review
Luxair operates 5 per week flights between Málaga Costa del Sol and Luxembourg City. Prices on Luxair can be high for this route but the value for money is excellent. We had a true tray with a complete meal on board with Luxembourgish specialities (which were pretty good). Cabin crew speaking in more that 4 languages and even in Spanish (very good point for a Spanish passenger like me). Seats and leg room were excelent and the plane was new and clean.

### Luxair customer review
Luxair tends to operate 2 types of planes mainly (767 are covering holiday destinations) - Bombardier Q400 (turboprop) and Embraer 145 (jet). I've flown with the latter one from Luxembourg to Paris CDG. Plane is tiny, so tiny that standard cabin luggage has to be put to cargo hold as delivery on aircraft - the lockers are big enough for a laptop bag and nothing more. Flight attendants very professional, polite and helpful - nothing to complain about, food was decent for such a short flight (60 min) which however forces you to eat quite quickly. I frequently fly with Luxair and I can recommend the airline, they are small, planes are tiny but service is good. Keep it up Luxair.

### Luxair customer review
As a frequent flyer I must recommend flying with Luxair. The planes are a little small and the price is not equal to a budget airline, but then neither is the service offered. Each time I have flown with the airline has been a calm and enjoyable experience. Staff are friendly and helpful. The food provided on the plane is tasty. On any occasion I have made a seat request upon check in it has always been made possible with absolutely no fuss. The security at the airport may not be very chatty but are efficient and it is to this day the fastest security I have been through in any airport.

### Luxair customer review
Luxair is a full-service airline that still serves sandwiches and champagne even in economy class. The flight attendants are always smiling and extremely friendly. They have some problems with online check-in which does not work in 90% of all cases but I would not hesitate to recommend Luxair and I would prefer them over almost every other European airline.

### Luxair customer review
Flew (LCY-LUX-LCY) on LG4592 and LG4603 on their Q400 in economy. Leg room was good for such a short flight. Breakfast was a pain au chocolat and a soft drink and the return (mid afternoon) was a muffin and a choice of drinks. I only had hand-luggage but there was plenty of room onboard. Value for money.

### Luxair customer review
I was quite impressed to see that not all airlines have gone the low cost way. Check-in was smooth and quick. I was given a pre-assigned seat at the window which I don't like. I think they should ask and not assign. The staff wasn't able to give me an explanation. Security at Luxembourg is very rude and unfriendly but not the airlines fault. On board a brand new 737 with sky interior I was impressed how quickly the stewardess changed my seat to an empty aisle. They even served apéritifs with a snack before a meal with free wine and all. And when I thought this is it they insisted to serve digestifs with the coffee. I'm sure I didn't pay much more than with other big airlines but this small player has something on offer on a 4 hour flight.

### Luxair customer review
Flight from TXL to LUX (with a stop in SCN) that stop takes 1hr longer on your journey! Price excessive for such a small route (for the same price I can fly from FRA to DXB). Unfriendly staff (as usual I fly Luxair twice a month). Q400 plane very noisy in the cabin.

### Luxair customer review
LG 3834 on 13 Dec12 MAD-LUX. Aircraft was an E145 jet. Clean and well taken care of. The welcome was warm and friendly. Service once again beyond what is expected these days. The Flight attendant made sure that all was well and never left me waiting to ask for anything A great snack box with different canapés fruits pate with salad and a nice pretzel-bread type bun with Spanish ham. Drinks - anything you like but I had cold Champagne and still water. The Crew were excellent. Recommended.

### Luxair customer review
Flew LCY to LUX and back in Q400 for a weekend. Both legs on time. Small croissant and tea/coffee/juice on the morning outbound flight and a ham sandwich and soft drink/beer/wine/tea/coffee on the evening return flight. Comfortable seats. Overhead compartments a bit small for anything bigger than a laptop case. Overall a good experience.

### Luxair customer review
LUX-GVA in C. Check-in fine (electronic boarding pass) and lounge excellent. Still driven to the plane by bus whilst the new small carrier terminal is closed. However good service onboard with nice breakfast box magazines etc. Personal touch. No luggage so no comments on that. Return leg that same evening lounge in GVA a complete joke only crackers and beer available why don't they let us use the Star Alliance lounge? Flight itself uneventful again nice cold dinner service + sandwiches from Y offered and all the drinks you wanted.

### Luxair customer review
LUX-CDG return on ERJ 145/135. The seats have seen better days but that's my only complaint. Generous legroom friendly flight attendants and ground staff and tasty croissants/baguettes served on these shortish 35 min flights give you the feeling of being treated as a real guest onboard. Flights left and arrived on time.

### Luxair customer review
LUX-GVA 40 minute flight. Nice Embraer jets and friendly service on board. Seating is 2x2. Onboard usually offered beef or cheese sandwich plus a drink - even champagne is offered free of charge. The only other comment is that there is little competition in Luxembourg airport - some flights can be very pricey which is ok if your company is paying but if you have to pay it many could not afford to go. Luxembourg new airport is very nice but the parking charges are pretty high (18 euro for 1 day). Shareholders are making a good return on their investment.

### Luxair customer review
TXL-LUX-SCN return in Economy. The flights were pleasant the crew was courteous and all four segments were well ahead of schedule. The food on the TXL-LUX-TXL segments was a choice of sandwiches (ham or cheee) which was enough for a leg shorter than one hour. The leather seats were very comfortable. The only downside is that LG uses three different check-in systems at all three airports which means that no boarding passes for the onward flights can be issued at either TXL nor SCN. The strangest thing however was that the LUXAIR check-in system would not assign to us seats in the emergency exit row from LUX to SCN. They were blocked for passengers travellers flying from SCN to MUC. Why they were not open for pax flying from LUX to SCN no one could tell us.

BCN-LUX with connection LUX-FRA in Business class. Was somewhat concerned that the first leg was with a Dash-8-Q400. However the aircraft was clean and well kept. Meal service consisted of assorted canapes and fresh rolls. Drinks ranged from wonderful Champagne to wines beers and non- alcoholic beverages. The connection to FRA was just as pleasant albeit for a flight of appx 40 minutes on a B737 once again canapes bread and a full beverage service offered. This airline is small but amazing.

As a Luxair call centre employee I would like to confirm that as from the beginning of this year we have worked from Mondays to Sunday each and every day - Mondays to Saturdays 8am to 9pm whilst on Sunday from 8am to 5pm. 5 call centre staff are employed each public holiday - handling German French and English calls. This is to clarify the wrong info below thanks.

I am a regular Luxair customer flying at least 2 times a month. Onboard service in C improved in last couple of months and I quite enjoy it. Cabin crew are helpful so no complaints there. With new Terminal at Luxembourg airport their ground service improved and it now looks more like an airport rather than a bus station in the middle of nowhere. Problems? Getting in touch with Luxair call center (especially outside of business hours) is a nightmare - don't even try on a Sunday evening or on a bank holiday. Another problem is their frequent flyer programme (or lack of it). Luxair participates in Miles and More but you are only awarded "award" miles (no status miles though). Therefore frequent flyers cannot benefit much from MM status increase. Luxair operates its own FF programme but in order to qualify you need to fly at least 50 segments in a calendar year (interestingly enough - regardless of the class of service - C does not count twice or anything like that). Overall a nice regional airline but I would not mind more integration with a big partner in order toluxprove their ground services and FF offer.

LUX-LCY on Q400 and LHR-LUX on ERJ135. I arrived very late at the airport but the check-in agents were helped me to get my flight. I spent no longer than 15 min inside the terminal building from check-in till boarding! Both flights very comfortable and perfectly on time. Spotless cabin interiors with spacious leather seating. FAs served snackboxes containing small sandwiches salad and sweets with a selection of newspapers and drinks - even beer and wine for free on these short one hour flights! I'm very impressed with Luxair as they improved comparing to the last time I flew with them.

LUX-FRA going on to YYZ in J class on Dash Q400. Check-in a breeze in the new Luxairport terminal which is spotless. Security cleared within minutes and on to the new lounge which is light modern clean and a decent selection of food and beverage options. Finding your way around the gate numbers a bit of an issue - priority boarding has no meaning as you will be bussed to these smaller aircraft. Decent choice of newspapers and magazines available. On time departure and nice breakfast served after take-off. No separation between J and Y class and seats are exactly the same if someone sits next to you it is as tight as in J class. I did not have anyone next to me so nice experience.

Heathrow to Luxembourg on E145 and return to London City on a new Q800. Two crew on each flight. Who obviously enjoyed their job despite both flight being full. On each occasion the flight was slightly delayed. But the onboard friendliness and the wonderfully tasty snacks they serve more than made up for it. They are not cheap though.

FRA-LUX in Y class. Short trip connecting in FRA on our way back from OPO. Nice little new plane. Great surprise was a snack-pack which we were given before take-off already which contained an orange juice water and two ciabattas which were delicious. Flight uneventful and luggage took 10 minutes to arrive which is long for LUX's standard's but I was very pleasantly surprised to see that LG has apparently decided to go back to the very good service airline they used to be in the 90's!

LUX-CDG on a ERJ and back on new Q400. As always both flights arrived perfectly on time. Check-in in a rush but unfortunately the ground staff wasn't the friendliest. Seats very comfortable with plenty of legroom on both types but the best of all were the tasty snacks they served during the short flights. A very pleasant experience!

Mixed feelings about Luxair. Onboard service is certainly quite good. However Luxair is totally overpriced on certain routes due to a regional monopoly on Findel. On top of that the company seems to suffer from a public service mentality. On two occasions I flew from Eastern European destinations to Munich with Lufthansa and then from Munich to Saarbrücken with Luxair and on both occasions my reservations to Saarbrücken were cancelled because of "no-shows" on the previous Saarbrücken-Munich-Moscow route. It took me 45 minutes to get hold of somebody at Luxair to correct the situation. On Sundays the Call Center is closed and nobody picks-up the phone at any of the numbers indicated on Luxairs website. I had to call somebody at the Lost Luggages of Luxair who told me that the ticketing office of Luxair Airport doesn't pick up the phone anymore when somebody is calling from outside. What a mess!

Dub-Man-Dub. An airline which truly shows what service should be Boarded bang on time service with a smile crew efficient welcoming drink hot towel usual nibbles 2nd drink offered. Crew chatting away to passengers really showing they do like their job. Flight deck kept us fully updated. And bags on the baggage belt within 10 mins. What a pity other airlines have gone down the cost cutting route and in so the service and standards slip. It was a pleasure to fly with Luxair.

Man-Dublin on CRJ-145. Very comfy seats in light grey leather. Best Embraer interior I have seen. Delightful FA's. Charming attentive and goodness me beautiful girls. Inflight service who cares it's only 40 minutes. No sign of any hot towels or sweets (mentioned elsewhere). Lovely though will definitely select again. Whole environment and feel is pedigree. Bit more expensive than EI (good) or FR (horrible) but still good value plus really quick boarding and deplaning on the smaller equipment.

Outstanding company! The kindest crew they welcome you with these candies. Planes are nice clean - I flew twice from LUX- Frankfurt and from Vienna. Nice sandwiches everything to drink and that is unlimited. The Embraer was small seats 1x2 but they even have catering on short flights and in that small plane. They are an exclusive company definitely.

Dublin-Manchester. Missed a flight with another airline and was delighted to get a reasonably-priced one way with Luxair at short notice. FAs very pleasant complimentary newspapers refreshing towel choice of complimentary drinks (including champagne) and even Luxair branded sweets -it's been a long time since I've seen that simple touch on an airline. Although I have no complaints about Aer Lingus on this route (good value fares self service check in allocated seating - as opposed to check in queues non allocated seating and not always low fares on Ryanair!) I would happily recommend Luxair on this short leg of their Dublin-Manchester-Luxembourg daily and having read the Luxair inflight magazine and enjoyed the service of Luxair am thinking of completing the journey for a short break in Luxembourg.

LUX-CDG return (and onwards to YUL on AF) 14/10 - 24/10 in economy. First flight fine in ERJ-145 (which are quite small however and are aging). Got sandwich and drink flight attendants ok newspapers available. Landing at CDG very bumpy but as flight attendants and later on pilot informed us this was because we got into a jet blast from a starting B747 which had departed just before we landed. Information much appreciated. Return on B737-500: plane was full cramped seating not comfortable at all I must say got served breakfast with coffee and juice; fine and uneventful flight. Landing very nice hardly noticeable. Luggage on conveyer belt before we got to the terminal (which took 5 minutes). Will fly them again.

I was impressed with LUXAIR. My flights were on-time and the FAs were great. CDG to LUX EMBRAER RJ145. Typical commuter terminal set-up. Take a bus to get there. Boarded from the tarmac. Reminds me of LAX. Plane has 1x2 seating. Fancy turquoise and black flight attendant uniforms for such a short flight in a small aircraft. Plane did have a special 2005 EU Presidency decal outside the cabin hatch. Lovely little brunch service. China and stamped metal flatware. Fruit cup rye roll croissant cute soufflé thing on a toast mozzarella bacon. Got a box of two chocolates at the end. Unfortunately my checked bags weren't there. I wasn't the only one to groan when the baggage carousel stopped without barfing out my bag. The checked bag arrived over 5 hours after I did. LUX to FRA Boeing 737-500. Nice Luxair VIP lounge. It's got a self serve espresso machine that grinds the beans fresh and dried fruit packaged snacks cute little sandwiches and bottled drinks. Plane is interesting. First class seating is almost the same as coach. The armrests on the center seat angle inward and a console goes on top with places for drinks. It looks they can sell as many business class seats as they want. A third of the plane looked like it was set up for business class! Seats are a little low. Seemed harder to get my carry-on under there. Leg room is okay. It didn't seem like there was much if any additional space between seat . They gave out packaged hand wipes and there were sandwiches on nice crusty bread for the snack. Impressive computer animated pre-flight safety video. Has video screen every 4 rows that retract up. Showed graphic of plane location during the flight.

I often fly Luxair as I am based in Luxembourg. The cabin service is the best I have experienced. Friendly real multilingual crew. There is an ample choice of newspapers. Even on short flights from LUX to CDG you'll get a nice sandwich and drinks in economy. Most Luxair flights are in shared codes so watch out through which airline you book you flight if you want those frequent flyer miles. The only complaint I have are these noisy slow Fokker 50's but they are being replaced right now.

Economy from Manchester to Luxembourg. Very nice flight with a freshen up towel given before take off and during the flight. I was impressed with the service and meal and the flight attendants were friendly and courteous. This was a very enjoyable flight. Check in was smooth as I was early. No delays. Only problem was the return flight was too early in the morning so I was unable to have breakfast at the hotel. In the end this didn't matter as I had breakfast on the aircraft.

Luxembourg - London City return. On a route where Luxair has real competition they are having to alter price and service to properly compete. This return to London saw passengers served an adequate sandwich and drink plus refreshing wipe after take off and sweets before landing. Price was very good for Luxair and the overall service was friendly but unremarkable. To note that on the way back all to Luxembourg all passengers were presented with a bottle of Luxembourg champagne style drink - a nice touch. This compares with the VLM service which currently dishes out a presentation box of English Tea!

I spend at least the half of my time during a 5 day week at different airports. As Luxair has the monopole in Luxembourg alternative flights to Germany (Frankfurt Berlin or Munich) do not exist and so the choice is not that enormous. Nevertheless I must say that the business class is more than just correct for such a little airline (french champagne little delicious sandwiches with salad 4 different wines as choice a sweet cake with cream and before the landing some excellent chocolate from Luxembourg). On the other hand I find the Business Lounge operated by Luxair just great. Compared to the ones in Paris Munich Frankfurt or wherever it has a very special flair a familiar atmosphere. (especially the new lounge in the added terminal is modern but I got not the impression of being exposed. On the contrary the Luxair`s Fokker 50 have a minimum standard of quality. It's not that they are very old but they are extremely noisy small and the interior is in a bad condition especially the seats. Therefore I always try to avoid them. The new ERJ-145 are much more comfortable. They have seats covered in leather offer good space between the seats and the same speed as a Boeing 737. Sometimes (in my spare time) I fly with Luxair (charter flights) to various destinations like Las Palmas Sharm-El-Sheik Madeira etc and it's there where I notice a huge lost of quality on flights - the cold meals are often disgusting and not so easy to define the sandwiches frozen and they stopped offering alcohol such as wine or beer. The cabin crew looks like very tired and is not very friendly and there are still little changes. Result - a very special character of a national inspired airline gets lost and I feel that this is not the end of significant changes especially concerning the service (business and economy class!? ).

I take Luxair many times and I'am always pleased to fly them. My last flight was on a brand new 737-700 on a Rome - Nice - Luxembourg flight. Luxair's new 737-700 have one of Europe's best economy class! The flight was on time before take off cabin attendants handed over new papers and refreshing towels as well as headsets for the inflight entertainment system (unique on short intra European flights!) On the 50 min flight we were served a sandwich selection on the 110 h flight from nice to lux a light meal was serves but always with a large selection of drinks! A real 5 star airline.

How come that every time I call Luxair Information (for landing times or other information) I first get a message asking me to hold for about 4 to 5 minutes (far too long) and then I get a ringing tone but nobody picks up!!! I just hung up after waiting or about 10 minutes without an answer. Looking after your call-desk would enhance the professional image of your company. I must admit that I'm dreading to call you by now as I never get the information I need anyway.
