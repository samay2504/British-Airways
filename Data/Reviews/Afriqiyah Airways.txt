I bought the ticket in February to travel to Kinshasa in April - in March all flights were cancelled because of the conflict in Libya. I went to the travel agency to ask about what I should do - the answer was to wait until the end of the conflict. Agency was unable to rebook me or to transfer to other airlines. I am having difficulties to find their offices in London or contacts - can someone help. I have lost my money and time and no one to help.

Gatwick to Joburg (troubles just beginning to brew in Libya). The start seemed off putting when I noticed an extra three hours on the flight time from Tripoli to Joburg which the booking office could not explain also when I was not on the reservations list at check-in. However the latter was sorted without hassle. Service on flight to Tripoli was fine plane new and clean food good. However we landed in a sandstorm which was worrying. Fortunately we were herded along to the departures lounge as all signs in Arabic. Onward flight delayed by a couple of hours due to sandstorm. Toilets at the airport were inadequate in number but reasonably clean. We were then taken on what felt like a mystery tour on an airport bus down a dirt road - turned out to be to the other end of the runway where our plane sat all on its own amidst military aircraft. The three hour extra time was now clear as it was a much smaller plane than expected (a few passengers had seats allocated on row numbers which were not on the smaller plane - however there was enough room and extra for everyone boarding). Once again food and service fine. There was a refuelling stop at Kinshasa. During my week in S Africa the revolution in Libya took off. I expected to lose my money and have to rebook myself back on an alternative carrier. However when I contacted Afriqiyah in Joburg they said I was re-booked on Egyptair travelling back same night as my original booking. They sent me email confirmation and my trip home went smoothly. The Afriqiyah staff were helpful and efficient in spite of what was obviously a stressful time for them. On the basis of value for money Afriqiyah is excellent but be prepared for a journey with a difference.

I booked a flight to Lagos via Tripoli. We had delays at Gatwick but once in Tripoli we were told to wait two days for our connecting flight to Lagos which - totally unacceptable. We stayed in the airport from early Mon morning until monday evening stranded without any local currency and offered refreshments approx 11am. After a lot of protest we were put on flight approx 8pm that evening. This was my first experience with Afriqiyah and will be my last - despite the savings it wasn't worth the terrible experience. The lack of communication in Tripoli was disgraceful and =on the plane the staff were curt.

BRU-JNB-BRU with a stopover in Tripoli. There were some troubles with the in-flight entertainment. On our way to JNB there were not enough headsets so we couldn't use the inflight entertainment. On our way back from JNB to Tripoli the inflight entertainment in our part of the plane didn't work at all. The food was okay and the cabin crew friendly. It's definitely value for money but there are some things to improve.

LGW-TIP-LGW on A320/A330. Both flights approx 1 hour delayed Servisair lounge at LGW basic and overcrowded quiet lounge in Tripoli. Uncrowded flights - very few pax in Business cabin. Comfortable seats for 3 hr journey but angled lie-flat seats on A330 too short for me (1.80m). Food tasty (no alcohol of course) limited but OK film choice on AVOD. FAs sweet but not all spoke english. Be aware Tripoli airport can be difficult to navigate as all signage in Arabic only!

We flew to Johannesburg from London Gatwick via Tripoli to attend the World Cup. All flights near enough on time and a smooth transit through Tripoli. Tripoli airport is not too bad although I wouldn't like to spend more than a few hours there. The entertainment was good food as good as expected the were polite (but spoke little English) and the seats comfortable with sufficient leg room. I did get the impression that the staff were probably a little too laid back at times. Overall the value for money was excellent the customer service was good and the planes were modern (although they did need cleaning up a bit.)

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
Firstly the take off was delayed with no announcements when we asked at the desk they just said 'we will go when we go'! Once on the plane we noticed it is empty so we had extra space but it looks like they failed to clean properly my table was covered in food smears when I asked for a wet towel to wipe it off I was told to 'just relax man just chill'! It was almost funny how clueless they were! Staff were friendly but no idea of customer service or professionalism. The quality of the food seems to be dependant of the airport you last left leaving SA or the UK the food was ok with a North African theme but when we left Tripoli the food was inedible. The flights are dry so they only serve warm juice or soda. The movies are heavily censored at first it's quite amusing but it gets irritating after a while. Woman's shoulders are blurred out and they even censor out all references to alcohol or gambling but blood death & murder are all good! Tripoli Airport is awful you can barely breath for the smoke and there's no organisation it's like going back it time.

London Gatwick - Tripoli - Accra return. Tripoli to Accra was delayed a little as only one scanner was working so when they started boarding about half the passengers were still on the wrong side of the security check. The other flights were on time. Food good seats comfy checked luggage was where it should be price was excellent. Having read previous comments here I had to see how bad the loos at Tripoli airport could be and was disappointed : clean and even soap in the dispenser!

London -Johannesburg via Tripoli return. I took the precaution of travelling hand luggage only and making sure not to use the bathrooms during the stop over at Tripoli and was pleasantly surprised. The service matched any I've travelled with over the years and at half the price. Considering they offer the option of twice as much luggage in the hold as any other airline I've travelled with I might even travel with lots of luggage next time!

CDG-TIP-OUA out ABJ-TIP-CDG return. Excellent flight to TIP clean new A330 with good food and friendly staff. Flight to OUA similarly well presented. Unfortunately the flight from ABJ-TIP was operated by Nouvelair on Afriqiyah's behalf other passengers also noticed the difference with grumpy staff and terrible food. Happy to return to CDG with Afriqiyah again and more good service.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
Crew dreadful food cold - delays from start to finish on outbound and inbound. Tripoli is the filthiest most hostile place and staff bully passengers especially female. We were delayed for 8hrs and no one would help. They all smoke in the no smoking areas the toilets have to be seen to be believed. Brand new planes are good but there the value stops - it is just not worth the saving on flight costs.

London Gatwick-Tripoli-Johannesburg return. I booked on price so my expectations were fairly low. The first three sectors were more or less on time fourth just under 30 minutes late. I was pleasantly surprised to find LGW check-in desk open nearly 4 hours before the scheduled departure time! Airline food is rarely very good in economy but Afriqiyah's compared quite favourably with most. My only criticism is that a couple of dishes were quite spicy - and a choice was not always offered. I was pleasantly surprised by the in-flight entertainment which had a modern touch-screen interface and seemed to be reliable. Legroom was good. For me the only negative issue really was Tripoli Airport. The departure lounge is small and not very comfortable. There were people smoking despite "no smoking" signs. Maybe smoking is only allowed in certain areas but the smoke carries everywhere. The toilets are in serious need of modernisation too. I was glad I didn't have to spend long there. The staff there were pleasant and helpful though. I would consider flying with Afriqiyah again if the price is right especially once the expansion and upgrading of Tripoli Airport is complete.

In June 2009 I booked a trip from London to Cape Town (via Tripoli) with Afriqiyah Airways leaving on Christmas day for about £400 - a pretty good deal. However in September they decided to stop in Johannesburg instead and booked us a transfer from Johannesburg to Capetown. Alas on our way out after an unscheduled stop in Paris to pick up "a few passengers" and a 4-5 hour unexplained delay in Tripoli we missed the connecting flight and had to pay £200 each for new tickets - despite reassurances from Afriqiyah Airways in Tripoli that they had transferred us onto later flights. In the end we were travelling for over 24 hours. On the way back the travel documents we used to travel out were not accepted in Johannesburg airport and we had to call the UK from a mobile to get further details. Once again we got stuck in Tripoli airport for over ten hours due to snow at Gatwick. Tripoli airport is awful - it is one giant ashtray with disgusting toilets. Despite the lovely planes this was the worst airline experience I have had.

I flew to Johannesburg via Brussels and Tripoli return. Flight attendants great who provided a cheerful and competent service. One even went to the business class to get me a lovely cup of coffee when he realised coffee was crucial to my travelling pleasure! Yes there were delays in Tripoli - but immigration officials were welcoming and we were kept fully informed as to the reasons for hold up. Toilets in Tripoli are as bad as everyone else suggests - do avoid. Useful to know that they accept Euros in their Duty Free and cafe.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
I have used Afriqiyah Airways for four return trips Gatwick - Accra over the last 14 months. Treatment has been unfailingly good. Yes there have been delays but informed of the reasons for the delays and on one occasion we were given drinks while we waited to go into the airport. The cabin crew are excellent and value for money is good.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
London-Tripoli-Johannesburg. Tripoli airport toilets are so bad you really have to be desperate to use them. Airline good value for money. Cabin crew not very cheerful looked tired all times. The only reason I would fly with them again is value for money but more friendly and cheerful cabin crew needed. A330 plane has good leg room and clean but the A320 plane not much leg room and needs cleaning up.

Tripoli - London Gatwick - Tripoli. New plan good entertainment attentive service. No problems apart from painfully slow Check-In at Gatwick and no alcohol.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
Dakar-Tripoli-Gatwick. Fantastic seats and legroom. Food was good as was in-flight entertainment. Friendly efficient cabin staff. Late departure but arrived on time. Price lower than alternative carriers.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
Lagos to Tripoli was ok except the deplorable condition of the toilet no inflight entertainment cabin crews were boring beyond description meal was ok. Landed at Tripoli airport on time and cheerful ground crew. I have never seen a worse and appalling toilets like what I saw at the Tripoli airport. Tripoli to Gatwick flight was ok a better and newer aircraft more responsive cabin crew inflight entertainment though without headset arrived Gatwick on time. Return flight was almost a replication of the inbound flights except that there was headset for inflight entertainment. Afriqiyah should replace aircraft flying Lagos leg its below international standard and they dare not fly such aircraft to Gatwick. Will fly them if they improve on the hygiene

Dubai - Tripoli - Dakar. All in all the flight experience was a pleasure with very good food good seat space and regular drinks - the spare seat next to me also helped. It was also good not to have the flight constantly interrupted by announcements of one kind or another in three different languages as seems to be the trend these days. Tripoli airport isn't a pleasure but no worse than you would expect and every landing seemed calmer than I am used to on the bigger planes. Two big faults though: firstly we had to turn the plane around for a sick passenger and no one made any announcement until about 5 seconds before landing which made most of us think we had turned around for a plane fault. Secondly on the outward flight my bags arrived two days late. Not a disaster for me but certainly it could have been for some people. No apology no attempt to trace me when the bag arrived (though they said they were just about to). Also only 3 movies for 26 hours of flying. Very cheap and comfortable.

London - Tripoli - Accra. Have to say that in both directions a pleasant and trouble free flight. Onboard catering was fine and Coach class seating exceeded standard specs both pitch and quality of seats. New aircraft but remember that this is a dry airline so no alcohol available. Overall I would be happy to fly with them again.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
The airline has improved since I first started travelling with them4 years ago. The airplanes are new food is great seats comfortable and staff are improving. However the baggage service is a big disgrace. At the airport in Mali the service is useless and at the office in Bamako they cannot tell us anything. So until Afriqiyah can improve this I will not be travelling Afriqiyah again.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
Gatwick to Accra. I was not disappointed with the quality of service - time seat cleanliness entertainment and food. Each section of the trip proceeded smoothly and I felt comfortable. Whilst the airline was superb I was disappointed with the toilet facilities at Tripoli. On both the outbound and the inbound flights I have never seen an international airport with deplorable and unhygienic toilets like the ones I saw in Tripoli.

Ouagadougou to Gatwick - the plane which was due to leave Ouaga at 1.00 am arrived at 4am & departed at 5am. I asked one of the ground staff before departure if I could possible catch the connecting flight at Tripoli which was due to leave at 8.30 am considering that it was a 4 hours flight to Tripoli and 2 hours time difference in advance. I was reassured more than once that I will catch the plane and even a message had been sent to wait for me there. I boarded the plane with a lot of apprehension and when we arrived at Tripoli I was not surprised to find that the plane had left without me 2 hrs earlier. I contacted Afriqiyah staff and they looked embarased and didn't know what to do with me - I had to stay in the airport lounge till the next day when one of the staff took somehow pity on me & upgraded my ticket to the first class. Food is not bad inflight service good and 48 kg baggage allowance for somehow modest ticket price.

I travelled London Gatwick-Tripoli-Douala with Afriqiyah recently. Arriving 4 hours late at 01.00 hours I discovered that my luggage and that of most of the other passengers was not on the plane. I could get no information from staff at the airport but was told that I would have to wait until Monday for the next scheduled flight to see if it was forwarded. With my schedule completely ruined and no change of clothing I had to book a hotel at my own expense and wait till Monday. I spent most of Monday at the airport trying to get information without success. Finally at 22.30 I was reunited with my luggage. Some passengers on that flight also did not get their luggage. I will not be using this airline in future even if it is still the cheapest deal.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
Gatwick-Accra-Gatwick and found the journey up to expectations. On time both directions and the onboard staff very attentive without being fussy. The let-down was Tripoli airport on arrival from Gatwick: very scruffy and down-at-heel and staff bullying passengers into line for us to obtain Boarding Cards for the Tripoli-Accra leg of the journey. Information was less than brilliant too. The return transfer was a better but that's probably because I knew what to expect! Afriqiyah Airways are good value in my opinion.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
London-Tripoli-Dakar returning in June. Much better than charter flights from Paris or charters to Gambia. Very few people on all legs of the flight meant that everyone could stretch out over 3 seats fast and efficient check-in I was told I could have taken 40kg but the ticket issued through last minute.com only said 23kg. Entertainment good western and arabic films interesting documentary and tapes of Koran. Staff responsive but dont fuss laid back will give extra food plenty of drinks. Food all Halal and more'real than that served on 'western flights' but the same on return. Delay at Gatwick but they held all connecting flights in Tripoli. Planes modern and clean. Staff helpful and responsive in Dakar in changing return flight for under £50. Good cheap way to get to West Africa. This is an airline that caters for ordinary people and adequately meets those needs.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
Afriqiyah Airways customer service is non-existent. I travelled from London via Tripoli to Cameroon last December. I lost my luggage - I am still to be compensated and nobody seem to care. I will think twice before travelling again with this airline.

### Afriqiyah Airways customer review
Have just flown to and from Tripoli. They were late leaving Gatwick on the outward journey due to missing passengers and luggage having to be removed but check-in etc was fine although we only had hand luggage. We returned on a new A320 Airbus. We left Tripoli on time and touched down at Gatwick on the dot. The service was fine and the food was acceptable.
