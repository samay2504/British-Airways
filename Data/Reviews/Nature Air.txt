### "no refund for cancelled flight"
❌ Not Verified |  As per all other reviews, no refund for cancelled flight. Only actually notified of outbound cancellation. Return flight cancelled without even notifying us. It seems from locals that the company is collapsing after temporary closure for a public investigation following a tragic crash. It's a shame they couldn't handle the fallout better. Still taking bookings for Drake airstrip when the airstrip is closed suggests pretty horrendous mismanagement. Avoid at all costs. Sansa - the main competitor in Costa Rica, were absolutely fine.

### "No refund for cancelled flight"
No refund for cancelled flight and no email response My flight from San Jose to Bocas was cancelled a few days prior, and I was asked to confirm booking number and credit card so that they can refund the money. Nothing happened, and they have not answered a single mail I wrote to them. Never ever again.

### "No refund for cancelled flight"
No refund for cancelled flight. Our flight from San Jose (Costa Rica) to Bocas del Torro 08Feb 2018 was cancelled. I got this information only because I wrote a mail to the airline because the airport on the ticket differed from that shown on the Nature air´s homepage. After a while the airline answered, that the flight is cancelled an that I will get a refund within a month. More than a month later I got nothing back. I am quite sure that I won´t see the money because of the troubles the airline hast to fight with. Do the still offer flights? Instad of the flight I booked a bus transit, which took longer than the flight would have, but I arrived safe in Bocas.

### "will not refund any of my money"
San Jose  to Golfito. I had a flight booked with them February 7th 2008 but they were not flying due to the government shutting them down. I have tried on numerous occasions to get my money refund. I even took out insurance. The company will not refund any of my money. If and when the do fly again stay clear of Nature Air the worst airline ever.

### "Do not use this airline"
My flight from San Jose to Santa Teresa was cancelled without notice. I only found out when I arrived in the airport that they were providing a shuttle instead. My 50 min trip turned into a 6 hours shuttle ride, 2 hour ferry ride followed by another 2 hour shuttle rise. My returning flight was also cancelled but with no shuttle provided. It is now 2 months and 100 calls later and I'm still waiting for my refund. Beware. Do not use this airline. I recommend using a private shuttle to get around.

### "Zero notice for cancelled flights"
Zero notice for cancelled flights! We found out our flight from San Jose to Drake bay was cancelled when we got to the airport. We then called to see if our flight (in 5 days) from drake bay to la fortuna was still operating. That was cancelled as well. Again, no notice! !

### "still waiting for a refund!"
They took our money, canceled our flight and we are still waiting for a refund! Every week they give a new lie as to why we have not received our refund. While they were just down by the Costa Rican government they were still booking flights and charging people for flights they knew they were never going to be able to make.

### "no refund has occurred"
Bahia Drake to San Jose. I booked two flights with Nature Air back in January 18, 2018. After the Nature Air crash, they canceled all flights through when I was to fly. They told me they would refund my fare, but no refund has occurred. I have contacted them over 20 times. Now when I contact them, they tell me to "wait until next friday.

### "Avoid this airline"
We booked our flights for our family to fly from San Jose to Tambor in November and subsequently booked our hotel and car rental. Today, 3 days before we fly they have sent us an email cancelling the flight! No explanation or help to change it, just a request for details to arrange a refund - awful customer service! Avoid this airline, use Sansa instead.

### "horrible customer service"
Tamarindo to San Jose. Absolutely horrible customer service. Just finished our first trip to Costa Rica and Nature Air was meant to be our flight out of Tamarindo to San Jose to reach our connecting flight returning to the US. The day before our flight they contacted me via email to inform me our flight had been cancelled and to reach out to them for my refund. No reason given and no options to resolve us getting back to San Jose. I have tried reaching out to them multiple times both by email and telephone and nothing. No help provided and I still haven't received my refund!! Luckily the concierge at our hotel was able to find us ground transportation.

### "booked a 16-passenger charter"
San Jose to Golfito. We booked a 16-passenger charter for our family to fly to Golfito. A few days before the flight, we received notification that we were now flying two planes a 12-seat Caravan and a five-seat plane. Suddenly weight mattered, where it didn't on the 16-passenger. They had to refuel the smaller plane 5 times (with jet fuel) before finally finding the lower grade fuel necessary for the 5-person transport. They did not load any luggage on the Caravan and loaded the five passenger plane with not just my family's luggage, but luggage of another family as well. When you book a specific aircraft and pay for that aircraft, you should get that specific seating arrangement. Our luggage was sent five hours later on another plane. The idea was to celebrate my mom's 80th birthday, with almost everyone on one plane. The new arrangement did not allow that to happen. Nature Air also wanted to change the return time to three hours earlier than we had chartered, with the same problems with luggage. Some of us were off to other destinations and HAD to have our luggage that night. We cancelled and booked another private charter, which went seamlessly. Somehow that airline was capable of loading all passengers and suitcases. My wife was stuck essentially in the luggage compartment so that everyone could fit, with my 12-year old nephew in the co-pilot's seat.

### "flight was competently executed"
I flew Nature Air less than 2 weeks ago one way only, from San Jose to Drake Bay. I was lucky not to have any issues with the timing of the flight, nor did I need any assistance. I do not know how that would have gone, but my flight was competently executed, enjoyable and quick. There were 7 passengers, if I remember correctly, and 2 pilots on a small Cessna. It was the first time I ever sat on one, but everything went so smoothly that everyone on the plane spent the short flight taking photos and making videos of the spectacular scenery below. We landed on a jungle strip, which has been paved recently, we learned. There were some private taxis waiting to transport us further in Corcovado. I could not have desired a smoother and more beautiful flight. It was far from cheap but saved me hours of trouble on buses and boats.

### "Thanks for the personal touch"
Puerto Jimenez to San Jose. Yesterday we returned to the US from Costa Rica. Our flight was scheduled to depart from Puerto Jimenez 10:15 a.m. but the plane schedule to pick us up had some difficulty and would not be able to pick us up. The gate attendant was very helpful and was able to call in a small plane from another domestic company, Aero Bell. We had paid the flex fare to allow us to carry a bit more luggage (which was well-discussed in our confirmation letter.) The 6-seater plane that replaced our original was able to get us to San Jose with an extremely tight connection. We were met at the Nature Air terminal by 2 attendants who carried our luggage to a waiting bus to get us to the main terminal. We were the only 2 passengers on that bus. The same 2 attendants carried our luggage to the United ticket counter and waited until United agreed to get us on the waiting flight. Again, the same two Nature Air employees grabbed our luggage and shepherded us through security and directly to our departure gate with only minutes to spare. Without their constant attention, we never would have made the connection. They went above and beyond to make an unfortunate situation a good one. That was especially important since departure options for later that day did not exist. As we waited to confirm we could get on the United flight, the attendant called his boss and offered to pay for a hotel room and shuttle in case we were not able to make the connection. That is what we would expect from a large airline, and it was nice to see it in this regional carrier. We have made 2 trips to Costa Rica with Nature Air, and we would do it again. Thanks for the personal touch and a job well-done.

### "don't care about their customers"
Quepos to San Jose. My wife and I had booked round trip flights with Nature Air four months in advance. Over the four months, we received a few e-mails regarding minor flight time changes, no big deal. Our flight from San Jose to Quepos on 7/7/17 was fine. Our return flight 7/15/17 was anything but fine. Our flight on 7/15 was to depart at 11:20 AM. When we arrived at the Quepos airport at 9:30 AM, the man at the counter said we missed the flight because they had changed it to an 8:50 AM depart. He then said we should have been e-mailed of the change. We had not been e-mailed. He then said they probably had also tried to call but no calls had been made AND we had great cell and wifi service at the wonderful Tulemar Resort in the days leading up to this flight. Nature Air had no other flights that day. It was explained to me by both the gate agent and Nature Air customer service by phone that we would be refunded since they had not informed us of the change. We have still not been refunded two plus months later and Nature Air just gives me the run around each time I contact them. Fortunately for us, Sansa Air got us on a flight to San Jose later that same day for less money. The poor lady and two children that arrived just after we did had to charter a private flight to get back to San Jose. Moral of the story - Avoid Nature Air and fly Sansa Air. Nature Air lies and don't care about their customers. I would never recommend Nature Air to anyone. Sansa Air had the opportunity to stick it to us as we had to get back to San Jose that day and yet they gave us tickets for less than Nature Air.

### "customer service abysmal"
❎ Unverified |  San Jose to Palma Sur. Totally agree with the other review. We received an email less than 48hours before we flew to say we wouldn't be going to our destination but to somewhere else. We tried to call Nature Air but spent 40mins on hold before giving up. We arrived early at the airport to try and get some customer service or assistance but their response was pathetic, no empathy or offer of apology, no assistance with making onward arrangements, just given an ultimatum of either taking the flight and booking onward arrangements ourselves, or cancelling the flight getting a refund and making our own arrangements. We were told by our hotel this had been happening to tourists for several weeks, so I wanted to understand why nature air couldn't have told us sooner so we could have made alternative arrangements. I wouldn't usually write bad reviews but we paid for the flights to remove a level of logistics, I had a bad ankle at the time and paid extra to fly - I did not want to be getting in and out of rickety boats with no life jackets! I gave nature air several chances to show their worth with customer service, wrote to customer service and phoned them, I've had no response in 8 weeks so posting my frustratons here. Only interested in your money. In summary, flight itself was fine, customer service abysmal.

### "shocking value for money"
❎ Unverified |  Used this airline to travel from San Jose CR to Drakes bay, a short internal flight. A week before we went we were informed by email that Drakes bay airstrip was closed and that we would now fly to Palmar Sur, a 'nearby' strip instead. On arrival we had a take a cab (10 miles), to a river boat stop where we waited for 3 hours before taking a 90 minute river trip to Drakes Bay. 5 hours later and £100 in fares poorer (Nature Air did not offer any assistance in the transfer at all) we arrived. Bearing in mind the flights are not cheap at £400 return for 2 for an hour in the air, we feel that this is a bit of a rip off aimed at maximizing receipt of tourist dollars. The return would have been the same but we were not prepared to wait 4 hours at the river restaurant and took a cab ride to a local bus station and took a clean, comfortable, air conditioned bus for £8 for both us back to San Jose meeting the locals and seeing the country, arriving well before the plane would have. Also, if you book the 'cheapest' tickets, where the baggage allowance is 12lbs you will be stung for excess baggage charges. Overall, a very poor experience, shocking value for money and poor customer care.
