### "denied to let me board"
Upon arrival to the gate. I reported my weight, and got new boarding pass (small plane). There were some other cancelations and it was a busy gate. The flight was delayed for an hour. I asked multiple time about the flight and I was told to sit down where I met other travelers on the same flight. Later, they started boarding my flight. I stood in the boarding line but when I got to the agent she denied to let me board. She claimed she wanted to know who is on the flight and didn’t see me and called for me and I wasn’t around even though I was standing in line. I was moved to a later flight. The lack of honesty about why I was removed from the flight is astounding. I am watching other flights board and I don’t see any agent checking the passengers before they board. I was lied to and denied boarding for a reason not clear to me. I called customer service and even they were shocked as they heard the agent rudeness. Eventually she told me the pilot made the decision to remove me from the flight but didn’t explain why!

### "unreliable for anything but sightseeing"
At the time I was supposed to board my flight I arrived to an empty and shuttered airport. No plane. No passengers. No staff. Finally, a staff person showed up to tell me she thought I was not coming. Oh? I was on my way to catch a Swiss Air flight from Boston to a 26-day trip to Europe, with 4 Airbnbs, 3 car rentals, and 6 international flights lined up and paid for! Yet Cape Air messaged me an hour and a half before the flight about cancelation due to a ground stop. In that message, they said they should try to secure ground transportation to Boston, but that did not happen. Apparently, other passengers called and said they found other alternatives. I was busy packing and not looking at my phone. They did not care about ruining my trip to Europe, where I was supposed to meet my son. I planned and saved for this trip for a year. I had to drive from Rutland to Boston to catch my flight and I had no choice but to park at the Logan Airport. Now, Cape Air is refusing to reimburse me for the cost of parking. And I think that is the least they can do after screwing me up. Their cancellation rate is way up. They are totally unreliable for anything but sightseeing. They are uncompassionate and irresponsible for not providing alternative transportation. And they are not trustworthy for saying they would and then not do it. I hope they go out of service for good.

### “would not let me check in”
Not Verified |  When you fly into Billings 4 hours before your flight. It would be nice to check in so you can go get a drink and relax or even eat. The only airline that would not let me check in was Cape Air. This has never happened before and it's a new rule the just implemented a month ago. So instead of enjoying a drink or food I have to wait in the lobby for a few hours. Last time I fly Cape Air. It's crazy they are the only airline that does this at the Billings airport.

### "flown Cape Air a few times - never again
Not Verified | Supposed to fly Cape Air from Martha’s Vineyard to Boston - 10:50AM - Saturday August 12. Got an E mail that the flight was canceled - 6 hours before. MV-is an Island. All subsequent flights were fully booked. My wife and I are in our 70’s - we had 2 large suitcases. Had to get to the Ferry - walk on - pay. Had to scramble at Woods hole to get a bus to Boston Logan - pay - missed our connecting flight to Toronto on Air Canada. We have flown Cape Air a few times before - never again.

### "don't care about getting you there"
Departure was set for 7:10am was able to check in online with no issues @ 6:30am same day. 6:42 showed no delay. Stating 6:40 being the latest acceptable boarding time. This was my first cause for concern since this small airport was closed not one employee TSA agent or otherwise. Placed a call got a recording about being closed and to call back after 8 or email. I "email" yet still there I stand alone in the rain. At 6:55 am I received the email from Cape air " we regret to inform you your flight has been cancelled" reschedule within 24 hours. Now I'm missing my connection not going to be on the west coast today. After finally getting an agent they don't apologize or explain just want me to rebook. I don't negotiate with companies that don't provide the services they accepted my money for while planning me in literally the dark with a valid explanation. She says it was a crew issue obviously we did inform you. The next days flight was supposedly booked. After the only option besides refunding my ticket was not going to get me there at an appropriate time to catch the last shuttle I chose the refund. I was spoken to like I had just done to her what cape Air did to me I wasn't interested in getting a discount or telling at anyone I only required decency and good business practices. Please spare yourself the time, headache and cash and book your flight with anyone besides Cape Air cause their motto is We just don't care about getting you there.

### "cancelled late the night before"
Not Verified |  7am flight scheduled was cancelled late the night before. Received an email after 9:20pm the night before, which was after retiring to bed for the night to be up at 0430 in the morning. Went to the airport for check in and was notified about the cancelled flight. I was given alternative flight choices including driving 2 and a half hours to Boston and paying $175.00 to park there for my trip duration. Instead, chose a later flight, completely changing my itinerary and now unable to choose seats on my connecting flights. My husband and I may not get to sit together and may be stuck in a middle seat surrounded by strangers. Also was charged $30 for a checked bag even though I specifically called and spoke with someone from the airline the previous day to confirm that we had free checked bags.

### "Easily the worst airline experience we've ever had"
Not Verified |  I or my family has flown this airline three times in the last year. Each time has been a disaster. The first was in the summer. Temperatures were high and we found out once on the plane there was no air conditioning. Several got off the plane in Burlington Iowa near heat stroke and throwing up. The second flight was near thanksgiving. Very cold in the Midwest. Once on the plane and taxiing we were informed the heat was on high but would not heat the cabin. Upon landing in Burlington Iowa my teeth were chattering and I was shivering from the cold. An elderly lady on the flight was so cold she could barely get off the flight. Then she found out the next leg of her flight had been cancelled. The ticket agent was of little help. Today, my sister's flight from Burlington Iowa to St Louis was cancelled with virtually no advance notice and forced to drive to St. Louis to catch a flight. Easily the worst airline experience we've ever had.

### "Take a rental car"
Booked the flight online with this being the last of a connecting flight. No ticket able to print and no check in time listed, just showed 10.15am. No one at the service desk upon arrival from connecting flight, check back a couple of times. Came at 10.15am and I was told we missed the flight. It was sitting on the tarmac, maybe give a check-in in time especially when you have no attendants? It’s Thanksgiving. Attendant didn’t try to reach the pilot. It’s a 6-8 passenger plane going to the middle of nowhere. They could have stopped. Worst ever in 25 years of flying. Take a rental car.

### "I still have not been reimbursed"
My Cape Air flight from Boston to Rutland was cancelled, only a few hours before we were supposed to travel. Cape Air first offered to refund us vouchers - which is against the law. I still have not been reimbursed, a full month later. They promised to refund me after a complaint with The Department Of Transportation - I suggest you do the same [dot.gov]. Evasive - I got a mail back stating I would be getting my money back and how this is all a misunderstanding, but that is it. They are playing that dishonest 'let's make it as hard as possible game, so that perhaps he will let it go'. It is the principle. Terrible airline.

### "Cape Air customer service is closed"
Thanks Cape Air! Stranded in Boston. My flight from Boston to Rutland is cancelled - I received an email from Cape Air a few hours before I was supposed to fly out. Just like that. No offer to make other arrangements, no offer of a refund, absolutely nothing. Cape Air customer service is closed. When I wrote them an email to the address found on their website it bounced!

### "This airline is terrible"
Not Verified |  This airline is terrible. We are currently stranded in an airport 3 hours away from home after the airline cancelled two flights due to crew shortage. The Cape Air agent was reluctant to arrange ground transportation despite the contractual obligation to get us to our destination. I will never use this airline again.

### "I am very disheartened with this airline"
Not Verified |  Cape Air has cancelled several of our flights this winter due to "pilot shortage", with little advance notice. Then when I call to get a refund, they give you the option of waiting forever on hold or leaving a message. When I leave a message, they rarely call back. So I have been "Caller Number 3" now for the past 20 minutes, after starting at "Caller Number 5" about 40 minutes ago. Do they have like one live customer service agent for the whole airline? I am very disheartened with this airline, with there were other options for flying to small towns in Montana.

### "Problem was handled professionally and promptly!"
Bag accidently routed to the wrong destination. Problem was handled professionally and promptly! Delivered to my home the next day with everything intact. All good. Great to have an airline service small cities. Staff very friendly and very smooth flight!

### "bad customer service"
Airline has a bad customer service. Clerk was not able to provide any solution to the delay on their behalf since they where not prepare to swap a plane due to pilot grounding a plane due to mechanical issue. Where waiting for over 4 hrs with no solution, the airline did not even provide any snack to customers due to their delay.

### "the service has significantly declined"
We consistently use Cape Air to travel from Bos to MV. However over the years the service has significantly declined. More often we see rude employees, and and unreliable service. Flights almost never depart on time and are almost always rescheduled. We are normally flexible and can roll it, and are happy to! However we are seeing more often that a reschedule occurs less than 30 days in advance, and leaves us empty handed as our new scheduled time departs before our connecting flights even arrives. This is just standard with Cape Air now a days.

### "Awful customer service"
Awful customer service, stay away. I traveled with a child and had a bag delayed. I tried to talk to a representative at Logan airport to schedule my bag to be delivered to my local airport since I do not live in Boston and had to catch a train. He would not help me and just said “Next” and ignored what I was saying. He made me miss my train. I went to a JetBlue representative who found a different Cape Air representative to help me. My issue was resolved in minutes. I missed my train and was left to wait for hours with a child in a train station all because of a matter that could have been resolved in minutes. Unacceptable.

### "airline is so disorganized"
This airline is so disorganized - I have flown with them many times but wish it weren’t the only option. Over those flights we have not once left on time. They should change their posted schedule to read “Maybe we'll leave sometime today. Maybe”.

### "Absolutely not reliable!"
Pilot choose to go home and not come to work! Missed all connections on the way home. No reimbursement offered for expenses occurred besides hotel. Absolutely not reliable!

### "blocked me from emailing them"
I actually have not flown Cape Air yet as my ticket is for 2 weeks from now. I emailed Cape Air asking for refund due to corona virus. Sadly, I live in US and nobody can travel, all people are cancelling trips .. so it's not possible for me to get to San Juan and then take the Cape Air flight even I wanted to. Other airlines, hotels, are refunding ok. Cape Air said I could reuse the ticket in coming months, then I said, like most, I will not be able to afford to travel for this kind of expensive trip for years as we resave. Then I get an email message that Cape AIr literally 'blocked me' from emailing them. Despite the fact that almost nobody will be able to fly Cape Air for several weeks so plans will be empty, despite the fact that Cape Air will likely cancel most flights soon anyway, Cape Air is 'choosing' to keep all the money from hundreds of flights over coming weeks paid by people getting sick, losing jobs, and in crisis. Pay more if you have to for another airline!

### "Cape Air is not dependable"
Boston to Rutland. This airline should change its name to something more descriptive such as “50/50 Air”, I travel for business and have done my best to work around the fact that Cape Air is not dependable. Unfortunately, as a business traveler, a tax payer, and a person who wants to promote the greater Rutland area of Vermont as a great place to live and work, Cape Air is NOT an asset. They are consistently late, often unable to fly due to seemingly mild weather issues, and often challenged by weight limits ( meaning passengers with paid tickets get bumped because another passengers luggage was too heavy ). The federal government subsidizes Cape Air almost $200 per passenger for Rutland, plus whatever Cape Air charges per ticket. Tonight I got bumped due to Cape Air accepting other passengers with too much luggage, so Cape Air, with YOUR TAX DOLLARS, had a driver deliver me from Boston to Rutland (3.5 hours) in an attempt to make up for their poor planning and tiny planes. At a minimum, the airline should set a weight limit for passengers and luggage, and for those that travel heavy, force them to buy a second ticket to cover the extra baggage weight. Long story short, Rutland needs a new airline, with larger planes capable of handling more passengers and cargo. Local, state and federal authorities need to do more homework and see that many folks traveling from Rutland drive to Burlington, Albany, and Hartford to catch flights. Many of these potential customers would fly out of Rutland if there was a more dependable airline proving service.

### "customer care was sub par"
Not Verified |  St. Croix to San Juan. The flight was fine - customer care before and after was sub par. At checkin I was refused checking my bags through to my final destination. My printed itinerary showed entire route attendant didn't care. Called United my connecting airline who acknowledged everything was in place and correct they called Cape Air. Response they still didn't care would not make the change. We had to get our bags in San Juan go back to United check them through go through TSA again and run to get on the plane. I am not a fan of Cape Air they had the power to fix it at check in and refused multiple times. Lazy, Uncaring and not my problem, was the attitude. never again.

### "the flight was canceled"
My wife and I had a flight scheduled for past Friday, May 24, 2019 @ 12:50PM from White Plains NY Airport to Lebanon NH Airport. Upon arriving at the airport we were informed that the flight was canceled out New Hampshire to White Plains due to weather. When I arrived home, I called the Lebanon Airport and they informed that had no weather related issues. The only canceled flight was that of CapeAir Flight 9K1083. I also found out that there was another CapeAir flight later that day and the next day from White Plains to Lebanon – and was offered neither option. I have repeatedly tried calling the company support number of 1-508-771-6944, with the call either terminating or being informed about protracted wait times.

### "this was a nightmare"
Cape Air canceled both of our flights between Saranac Lake, NY and Boston. And both of these Cape Air flights were booked to connect to international flights into and out of Boston Logan. They at least let us know about the cancellation of the outbound flight from Saranac Lake to Boston and moved up to a much earlier flight (which left us with an 8 hour layover at BOS). But on the way home to Saranac Lake, they canceled our flight from BOS at the last minute while we were waiting at the gate. Their solution to cancelling our Saranac Lake flight was to rebook us into Plattsburgh (a 1+ hr drive away from Saranac Lake) and book a driver to take us from Plattsburgh Airport to Saranac Lake airport (where we had all left our cars). Sounds good but we got into the Plattsburgh Airport and there was NO driver. It was late, the rental car desks were closed. We were on the phone with Cape Air reps for over an hour - none of whom offered any solution. Finally, but sheer luck, a taxi driver pulled up to the airport and found us there. We had to hire him to drive us to Saranac Lake airport and pay the cost. Cape Air says to fill out multiple forms, attach receipts, etc... and they will reimburse us the taxi fare. Honestly, this was a nightmare. No one apologized.

### "a huge disappointment"
We booked these Cape Air flights to get to Bimini island, Bahamas. We were very excited to be landing on and leaving from The water. Weather on our first flight was to bad, too much wind so we had a delay And were Forced to land on ground. The "seaplane" service from Bimini left from the airport again instead of on the water, even though it was a Beautiful sunny day And the competition had not problem starting from the water. We Saw 2 planes coming in And leaving from the water without any problems an hour before we left. This was a huge disappointment. We heard that they hardly ever land or leave from the water!! Please be aware of this when thinking of booking a seaplane flight. Landing in FLL was far from main buildings, but a shuttle was waiting for us to take us to the terminal. The service desk and pilots are very friendly and helpful, but we won't book a seaplane flight at Cape Air again.

### "staff could not have cared less"
I sat waiting while they had to locate the pilot, we left an hour late. Once I scheduled the first flight back to Nantucket because I was coming in on a red eye, they didn't run that flight and gave no reason, I had to wait another 2 hours. Recently when they changed over their computer system somehow my reservation 'froze' and they could not let me on the plane. I waited while two schedule flights left and had to buy another ticket just to get to Boston, to miss the event I was trying to attend. I could not believe that this company would set up their employees for such failure with this new computer system. No one was trained to operate the computer and it was a complete disaster. And this last time I was delayed due to fog in NY and even though I made it on time they had sent that plane early. Sent early despite knowledge of the east coast weather and despite the fact they didn't offer another flight for 3 hours. You may be asking yourself, "Why would this lady keep flying Cape Air? Well the answer is there is not any competition for this airline and they will treat you as such. Because what can we do as a customer when there is no other option? What do they have to offer an an apology or reconciliation for their poor service - nothing! The staff could not have cared less about my reservation or predicament. I have never been treated so poorly by a company over and over. The Cape Air website speaks of great customer service and quality but that is obviously just a cloak for their poor customer service practices and obvious lack of concern for any of their patrons. Take the bus, Rent a car, anything but don't bother to fly with them. It only leads to frustration and no one accountable for their failings.

### "never recommend Cape Air"
I fly 20 -30 times per year with a lot of that international. Much of that to very remote locations and large cities. I have never been treated worse and would never recommend Cape Air. First if your flight originates on Cape Air you can not precheck online or use any real airline apps. Major pain for frequent flyers. Of course this means you won't know your gate, gate changes, flight status updates. You must go through security twice. When you fly into Logan you need a long layover time because you have to change terminals and go through security. The stated times on their site is "Wheels up" the flights will take off early. Today I freely admit I arrived late to Augusta airport (size of my living room). The plane is boarding and appears only 1 person on the entire plane. They refuse to check me (remember no such thing as precheck on this flight and your connection). The plane is still open. It is 15 minutes before the scheduled departure and the plane leaves. I have one bag no check in, and there is no one boarding it would have taken 2 minutes and the plane still could have left 10 minutes. Insult to injury they refuse to help with connecting flights. They can but will not. The person told me if they have an issue they will help, but if it is your issue you are on your own. So why bother? Portland is an hour away and is a real airport. Don't kid yourself you will not save time or aggravation using Cape Air.

### Cape Air customer review
LEB-BOS on Cessna 402. Only 4x passengers on the flight. All staff at Lebanon Regional Airport were polite. Weather for the flight was awful, cloud and rain, so no chance of any view on the way. Very smooth trip despite the weather. Arrived on time.

### Cape Air customer review
12/22/2014 flight 1579 and 1/2/2015 flight 1574. My first impression - there's definitely plenty of room for improvement in the areas of customer service. On a positive note the actual flights themselves were great however there were several issues that left me frustrated and stressed out - not a good way to start and end vacation lack of efficiency lack of sensitivity care and compassion for customer sensitive issues (such as held back luggage) inconsistent information unclear information (resulting in a surprise $280 in luggage fees). Lack of attentiveness to customer inconsistent protocol (you need signs posted in the airport and don't cover up gate doors with plants) so that customers can find you.

### Cape Air customer review
BOS-ALB-OGS. Leg #1 We were about 10 minutes late due to weather (Can't control mother nature). We more than made up for the delay by arriving a little bit early. We had a great tail wind. Leg #2 arrived 15 minutes early. I grew up with this airline and hope it continues on into the future.

### Cape Air customer review
July 19 2014 departing Lebanon NH. Flight 9K1872. I have never seen such a circus of inefficiency. Flew out of Lebanon New Hampshire where they departed 40 minutes late because that was how long it took them to pass 9 customers through security. Missed connection to my non-stop flight and now will spend the day flying from airport to get home late tonight. Avoid at all costs.

### Cape Air customer review
Sitting in Logan again canceled flight to Bar Harbor due to "maintenance". Second time they've done this. First time I was the only one waiting for plane this time its me and one other. They won't run for two people apparently. They loaded two other planes that had later departures than ours before canceling ours. I'm spending a vacation day at an airport. Should've taken a bus. I'd be there by now.

### Cape Air customer review
I was supposed to fly from Kirksville to St. Louis hassle free only an hour long flight. I show up to the airport and find out my flight has been cancelled. They could have notified me the flight only has 9 people max on it. How hard would it have been to call and let us know so we could make other arrangements. I missed my connecting flight in St. Louis as well. Never again! Awful service too much trouble only driving to St. Louis from now on. Not recommending Cape Air to anyone!

### Cape Air customer review
I was bumped from a flight Rutland VT to Boston and almost no effort was made by the person in charge to find a volunteer who could take a later flight. Be aware that they can bump people due to weight issues on the plane (people had a lot of luggage apparently and I was told the flight would have been 80 pounds over the limit if the plane had flown with the normal number of passengers that day - they were not even overbooked). My understanding is there is no limit to their ability to bump for this reason and they don't need to pay any compensation whatsoever. I was headed to Boston to make a connection to MN. The woman in charge seemed unconcerned and thought that since she could fly me from a NH airport departing much later and have me arrive in time to run to my connection there was no harm done. I explained to her that I was sick and mobility and energy were issues at that point she offered to set up a wheelchair for me in Boston. My experience with Cape Air tells me they are mostly nice people but I would never rely on them again in any situation where arrival at destination on time is important. I should add they did offer me a free RT ticket on Cape Air (for use in the next year) but this is of no use to me since I would never fly Cape Air again.

### Cape Air customer review
Returning home from Boston (to Ogdensburg) severe fog did not permit take-off of Cape-Air's small plane. Several people absolutely had to get home that night. Cape Air went above and beyond. They re-booked all of us on an outbound flight from Logan to Albany then hired a driver in an uber-comfy shuttle van to drive everyone the rest of the way to Ogdensburg. Long journey and not quite what any of us was anticipating that day but cannot say enough about the service and kindness of the Cape Air staff.

### Cape Air customer review
I had the first flight of the day and weather conditions did not hamper take off. Crew made no attempt to depart on time and left 25 minutes late causing me to miss connection costing me to add 9 hrs to my trip due to missed connection. The delays were strictly caused by the airline.

### Cape Air customer review
I was informed that my flight from Boston to Rockland was cancelled no reason given no flight available for the next day. No compensation offered. No other transportation home was available at that hour. I was assisted in my wheelchair by a Logan airport employee to the ground transportation areas (after getting my bags) and waited for a hotel shuttle. The cheapest hotel available cost me $188 plus food for that evening and the next morning. Next morning I took the shuttle back to the airport so I could pay $46 to ride the bus to Rockland. Had this flight been cancelled in Rockland and I could not connect my flight in Boston I would have been out several hundred's of dollars and United will not give refunds. A last minute cancellation by Cape Air means a no call no show at United or whatever airline one might be flying with. Very costly trip. They tried to tell me they would help me out if that happened. It did happen from Boston to Rockland (just their ticket cost) and would do nothing for me.

### Cape Air customer review
STL-CGI. I was mortified when these people asked my weight then had to weigh every bag in my possession. The flight down in the tiny plane was so bumpy but that's not the airline's fault. I think I would rather drive from STL to CGI next time.

### Cape Air customer review
BHB-BOS. Cessna 402 aircraft. Online booking was fine and check-in at BHB friendly and efficient. Interesting to see how every weight consideration had to be taken into account for the flight - obvious but something I've always taken for granted having not travelled on this small an aircraft previously. Full flight (9 adults 1 child pilot). Surprisingly comfortable ride at 3000 feet and landing as smooth as I've experienced. Great experience.

### Cape Air customer review
I have flown Cape Air several times due to convenience of location. Unfortunately this airline has disappointed me every time: flight delays cancellations the airplane leaking fluids inside and dripping on me in flight etc. They have cost me time money and a lot of stress.

### Cape Air customer review
Most expensive but they advertise well. Flight delayed over an hour pilot shows up enjoying a nice ice cream. Return flight pilot has 'car trouble' and the gate attendant leaves to go pick him up so we missed our connecting flight. I suggest leaving a lot of extra time between connections if you plan to fly this airline. Nice planes though.

### Cape Air customer review
PUB-DEN-BOS-RUT one way. The last leg was on Cape Air. Despite inconvenient location at BOS service is friendly and small aircraft are abnormally comfortable; the seat in front of you has a shape similar and usable as a footrest. Service is wonderful pilots crack jokes you are greeted personally at check-in. At BOS as I was boarding I realized I had forgot my laptop in the terminal. I ran back up to get it and met the gate agent bringing it to me. When I arrived in RUT it turned out my bag got lost. Despite the fact it was not at all their fault and that I could not provide them with any information they tracked it down within the hour and had it delivered in 36 hrs. If Cape Air flew to destinations that allowed me to do so I would go out of my way to fly with them.

### Cape Air customer review
MVY-BOS. Had to book fairly last minute and the fare was pretty reasonable. Check in staff friendly and professional at Martha's Vineyard although you do have to jump on the scales as the aircraft is so small. All passengers taken onto tarmac just before the flight and the pilot 'balances' out the plane. If you're lucky you'll get to sit up front and make the most of the view. Unfortunately I am neither blonde nor female so I was out of luck on this occasion! Very quick hop over and bags out within 10 minutes. Great experience and extremely convenient.

### Cape Air customer review
PVC - BOS. Arrived at the airport a little over an hour before my scheduled departure and immediately placed on the flight about to depart. Short 20 minutes from Provincetown to Boston smiles all the way. A real treat compared to the "big boys".

### Cape Air customer review
SJU-EIS-SJU San Juan to Tortola on a Cesna 402. This is really a great flight! Lots of great island views in the Cesna. You see all the virgin Islands on your approach to the BVI. I put on my ipod cranked up the Bob Marley and enjoyed the flight!

### Cape Air customer review
Boston to Provincetown return many time over this last summer. This is a wonderful airline. From the moment you make your reservation you actually feel like every employee you come into contact with cares about you. Granted the planes are small - no inflight services since most of the flights are so short but you feel important. Earlier this summer I experienced weather related delays and the gate staff at the Provincetown airport sent out for pizza to feed us on the ground while we waited for clearance to take off. I know of no other airline that still treats its customers with such genuine attention.
