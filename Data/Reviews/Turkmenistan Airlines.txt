### "unexpectedly pleasant experience"
An unexpectedly pleasant experience. The booking process was a bit odd but after using several different credit cards one finally worked on the airline website for a ticket about 500 euros less than any other airline. Check in and boarding was smooth. Two suitcases allowed at 20kg each. Or one at a maximum of 25 kg. There was entertainment with several English language recent films. Ample food provided. The layover was fine. No one was saying anything about not taking photos and it wasn't any more different than transferring in China. Seemed the duty free shops take card now too.

### “service is very good”
We flew with Turkmenistan Airlines for 2 flights, one from Milan to Ashgabat (5hrs30) with a Boeing 737 and another flight (8hrs) from Ashgabat to Kuala Lampur with a Boeing 777. Both flights were much better than expected after reading the reviews. Both aircrafts looked modern and clean with very comfortable seats. For the very affordable prices the airline offers, the service is very good. We got 2 meals on both flights and unlimited coffee, water or any other drinks. The staff was really nice and you can even ask for a blanket if needed. The only negative point is that you can’t check-in online which leads to long queues at the desk but expect from that, everything was fine. We would definitely fly again with this airline, they deserve more good reviews!

### "Crew were friendly"
The seat was spacious but the recline function was lost on my seat. Crew were friendly. They offered one meal plus one snack for just 6.5 hours. The onboard announcement was inaccurate that they claimed to be landing soon 2.5 hours before the actual landing. Surprisingly personal onboard entertainment was offered

### "crew disinterested and surly"
Not Verified | Ashgabat to Birmingham. Absolutely awful! Cabin crew disinterested and surly, I would hate to see them have to perform in an emergency situation. Aircraft grubby with the crew unable to work the inflight entertainment. No real attention to the safety briefing. Crew smoking in the toilets and cockpit door wedged open for a while. Cabin crew did not use shoulder straps on take off and landing. No alcohol served and food terrible. An airline that should not be allowed to fly in the 21st Century. Avoid

### "was not very satisfied"
I flew flight T5 921 from Ashgabat to Istanbul. The plane is old. The food is terrible. There were no delays. The staff is not bad. The flight was not very comfortable. The seats are uncomfortable. Overall was not very satisfied, because the price-performance ratio is terrible

### "Ignorant and arrogant"
Not Verified |  Ashgabat to Birmingham. This was a last minute booking due to a business meeting back in the UK. The best way to describe the airline is "Disorganised". Ground staff are surly and don't appear to know what is going on and the flight crew are not a lot better. I flew on a 737 which was worn and dirty. Only 4 fare paying passengers in Business Class with 2 flight attendants but almost impossible to get their attention. There were however another complete crew flying in Business to fly the plane back. Ignorant and arrogant is the only way to describe them. Food inedible. No alcohol. No inflight entertainment. Crew constantly going to the toilet to smoke. Cockpit door left open with the Pilot and Co Pilot smoking. When we landed the 2 flight attendants weren't even strapped into their seats. No pre landing checks made. I am amazed that this airline is allowed into UK airspace.

### "Great Indian vegetarian food"
Birmingham to Amritsar via Ashkabat. No nonsense air line. Great Indian vegetarian food. There was no flight screens, no seat screens. We stopped at Ashgabat for one hour, its nice modern airport with all facilities. The good thing was that the time at Ashgabat and time in India is only 30 minute difference.

### "how not to do long haul"
Ashgabad to Birmingham. I read some reviews before I flew on this airline so my expectations were pretty low. People were smoking in the toilet throughout the flight, pumped into the circulating air conditioning, it stunk. The stewards did two meals and two coffees in the entire flight. Was a drunk passenger staggering up and down the aisles ranting. I would have expected a steward to tell him to sit down, didn't happen. He must have brought his own alcohol. No TV, no alcohol, no duty free, no WiFi and rubbish food. This was a long haul and expensive flight, if you can avoid Turkmenistan Airlines avoid it. Was a true experience on how not to do long haul. So far out of all the long haul flights I have been on this was by far the worst. This airline makes EasyJet and Ryanair look good.

### "Seats cheapest ever"
Ashkabat to Bangkok. As other flight from Paris, 2/3 full so easy to move seats. Food was worse this flight, barely edible. Plenty of soft drinks, but never had someone hand me a packet of instant coffee and a cup of boiling water. Seats cheapest ever. No in flight entertainment except overhead map. Was way too warm and try getting any staff to come through during flight is impossible. For second time, someone lighting up a cigarette and no announcement to stop it. Stunk up the place. Flight was on time, landed early. Plane seemed new but like other 737. They got the absolute cheapest configuration. I would fly again if I was assured the 737-800 but not the 757-200, as they are 25 years old.

### "bring your own water and food"
Paris to Ashgabat. Check in baggage allowance was 25 kg, not the 33, that most others have. Flight left on time, 2/3 full. Plane new, but no entertainment except map overhead. Seats maybe cheapest I've ever seen. Like most 737 planes rows near exit doors do not recline. food was hot, ok, but definitely not the ritz. No alcohol served. Plenty of soft drinks. If you are squeamish, bring your own water and food and entertainment. The big complaint was someone smoking and no one said a thing. It stunk up the whole cabin. Staff emotionless. Price was cheap, so value for the trip was ok. Ashgabat Airport is new, almost no one speaks English and definitely not French. I went in expecting horrid and disastrous, but all in all was a new experience.

### "cabin crew were emotionless"
Was booked on Turkmenistan Airlines to return to the UK after completing a work assignment in the Caspian. First of all, by their nature, the Turkmen people are standoffish. Multiply this by 20 if they wear any form of uniform, so going through Ashgabat Airport is not an enjoyable experience. The aircraft, a Boeing 777, looked fairly new and as I was flying Business Class I had high expectations. The cabin crew were emotionless and stilted when I was shown my seat, and I was offered a plastic cup of water or Pepsi as a pre-flight drink. I asked if there was any Champagne but was told "No -a lcohol is not allowed" There were only 6 pax in Business Class, but Economy was full. Crew were very lax completing pre take off safety checks, and we took off with 2 passengers with their seats in lay flat bed mode. The minute the wheels left the tarmac the crew released their seat belts and started walking around the galley and cabin. There are large seat back TV screens, but there is no entertainment onboard. Food is served piping hot, but is so bad that it is inedible. Around an hour into the 6 hour flight a male FA plonked himself down in the empty seat across the aisle from me, reclined the seat and then watched a movie on his smart phone. When the seatbelt sign came on for landing at Birmingham the crew went through the motions of pre-landing safety checks, but did not ensure that seats were upright or that window blinds were open. One stewardess was still walking around the galley when we landed. Avoid flying with them if possible!

### "avoid this airline at any cost"
London to Bangkok via Ashgabat. I read the reviews for Turkmenistan Airlines before I flew, and thought that if I went in with low expectations then I couldn't be disappointed. I was wrong. The outgoing flight was delayed by 2 hours with no apology and worse there was nobody to be found to explain what was going to happen with our planned changeover. No one at Heathrow knew how to contact them or were even aware that they flew from the terminal! Most of the food was inedible and the in-flight entertainment non existent. Our return flight left Bangkok at 4.40am and when my boyfriend asked for a blanket he was told they were only for business class passengers and babies. The lack of organisation at both check in and flight changeovers was laughable, I've lost count of the number of hours we have wasted standing around in chaos. In short, avoid this airline at all and any cost.

### "air crew were miserable"
Birmingham to Amritsar via Ashgabat with Turkmenistan Airlines. Flight time was moved forward by a few hours and we were not notified. When we arrived at airport they were already boarding the aircraft. Fortunately we could still check in and did not miss our flight to India. Staff are a bit disorganised. Seats were allocated so couples sat on opposite ends of the aircraft which did not make any sense. The return flight was due to leave at 9am but did not depart until later in the afternoon. We were not provided with any refreshment or information during the long delay. The aircrew were miserable. No in flight entertainment and food was average to tasteless. The curry spice foods are too spicy hot to eat. If delayed for 5 hours they should have at least provided fresh water and sandwiches in the airport free of charge. No apology, partial refund or refreshments were given.

### "disappointed with the service "
London to Amritsar via Ashgabat with Turkmenistan Airlines. Disappointed with the staff and the service both ways of the route and the staff seemed disorganised of what they were doing. We were delayed by 4 hours and we sat in the plane without the staff giving any snacks or water. The seat quality was also bad. The size of food portion  was a lot. There is no entertainment on the plane and there are no tv's at the back of the seats.

### "not recommend to anyone"
Flew Birmingham to Amritsar via Askhabad return on Turkmenistan Airlines and flights delayed on both occasions due to plane issues at Ashkhabad Airport. Going out we were delayed 6 hours, and 4 hours on return flight. We were made to wait ages before being given any info re flight issues. Staff on flight were miserable and curt when being asked any questions. Staff at airport were OK but due to lack of English it was very difficult to find out what was happening and no-one felt it was important to inform us passengers as to what was going on - whilst we were made to wait in the airport. Water was the only thing provided from airline so we had to pay over the odds for the food at the airport. Would not recommend Turkmenistan Airlines to anyone.

### "cabin staff were miserable"
Birmingham to Amritsar via Ashgabat with Turkmenistan Airlines. There no delays, the food was great but the cabin staff as usual were cold-faced and miserable. There were a lot of chatty passengers that helped make the experience good.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
We normally use Turkmenistan Airlines regularly to fly to India. Have been doing for over 10 years. We will never be flying with this airline again. On the way to Amritsar on the 31st July the crew on the flight were so miserable and safety was of no interest. Although we made it clear I couldn't eat meat when I booked the ticket, they ran out of vegetarian food when it got to me. They just dumped whatever on my tray. I asked what it was and they said lamb. I told them I'm vegetarian and I can't eat this. They said it's all finished and snatched the lamb from my hand and started having what I can only describe (due to the tone only as I couldn't understand the language) as a dig at me between each other. They never seem approachable and quite frankly they come across very annoyed if you call for them. On the way back from Amritsar the wait was only supposed to be 2 hours max. The flight way supposed to leave Ashgabat at 1:30pm but didn't leave until 6:30pm. I get that all flights can get delayed but it's the way the issue was dealt with. First of all we were not told that there was a delay and when passengers started questioning they just struggled their shoulders like they couldn't understand English. Around 3pm they put 4:30pm departure time on the board and when it hit 4:30pm still nothing. Around 30-40 passengers got together to ask where our flight was. The manager said it's gone to Dubai and we asked why. She said she will be back in 2 mins and never returned. The others persons we questioned just kept telling us to go away and were actually laughing at us all. Very offended. There were Turkmenistan Airlines staff in the background looking at us and laughing amongst each other. When I finally got home I realised this is a regular thing. They say 2 hour wait but I'm facts it's been 5 hours for all three flights which my friends were on because the flight goes out to Dubai and back whilst we have to wait. We were never informed of this at all and if I knew I would never have agreed to fly with them especially because of the prolonged wait.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Ashgabat to Minsk. Brand new Boeing 737-800. Good seat pitch config 3-3 seats are comfortable enough. There are only TV's in the middle of the cabin there is no other entertainment. Flight attendants are very polite. Good value for money comfortable and enjoyable experience overall.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Travelled from Birmingham airport to Amritsar airport via Ashgabat. Plane looks a bit dated staff are very nice and they gave us food which tasted beyond satisfactory. The seats were comfortable and I was impressed with the leg room. Flight was comfortable but never ending due to lack of entertainment in-flight. I strongly advise you to take a laptop or tablet with you as the flight is long and never ending especially the journey from Birmingham to Ashgabat. Ashgabat airport is lovely and gives you a chance to stretch your legs. There is a bar in Ashgabat airport which provides western food and alcohol. Overall I'm impressed with the airline as the fares are relatively cheap and you get where you want to on time and hassle-free. They just need to sort out the entertainment at least show the maps like they used to. I recommend this airline to everyone.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
I flew from Ashgabat (ASB) to Moscow (DME). I flight with new Boeing 777-200LR (EZ-A778) which airline has purchased recently. On board is very spacious and beautiful. Everywhere there are plasma screens but the entertainment system is not yet working. The staff is pleasant speak 3 languages: Turkmen Russian and English. Aboard was interesting magazines about tourism learned a lot about the Turkmenistan. Food and drinks was good. New Ashgabat airport terminal 2 looks fresh.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Flew from BHX to Ashgabat. It was a night journey but no blankets offered. Food was not very nice so I took my own with me the drinks were ok. This was on a Boeing 757. No entertainment but I was already aware of this as I had flown with them before the leg room was good. Some staff were nice.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Worst airline and customer service I've seen miserable staff who don't smile. Travelled with them once before and was unimpressed however gave them the benefit of doubt and used them again. Heathrow to Ashgabad 3 seats together for my family which is what I would expect Ashgabad to Amritsar they split our seats how on earth can an airline give a 3 year old a seat on the other end of the aircraft by themselves one seat at back of aircraft one in middle and one at the front. When we spoke to staff they couldn't care less! Last time we will use this airline.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Travelled out to Punjab on 22/12/13. Flight delayed from 4.40pm to 10.40pm. Pilot advised it would take 5hrs 50mins to Askerbad and it landed on time then flight to Amritsar was 2hrs 15 mins and again it landed on time. Waited at Askerbad for approximately 90 mins while crew changed and 757-200 was refuelled and cleaned out. Plane does look a bit dated now no entertainment so bring your own staff are friendly enough and respond to your requests 2 meals and a snack and plenty of bottles of water. Flight back was 2 hours 45 mins to Askerbad and 7 hours 30 mins to Birmingham all went to clockwork only hiccup was some of the luggage was not put on the plane so we filled in a form and handed to the Birmingham Airport rep to forward luggage home by a courier. So all in all pretty happy with Turkmenistan Airways pretty good service and the cheapest flights out to India.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Flight out of Heathrow was in economy flight nowhere near full so had 3 seats to myself food surprisingly top quality but service lacked friendliness. Cabin was shabby and in need of refurbishment! Pilots made no announcements. Flight back to Heathrow I was upgraded to business class without asking. The seat was obviously bigger but lacked the foot extension you get with Emirates business class the seat was also in need of replacement due to shabby arm rests. Service on return flight was very good flight attendants friendly and spoke fluent English. Food plentiful and a choice of three dishes also provided with a flight pack pillow and blanket. All in all flight home was great because of the comfy seat that allows some chance of sleep. My biggest gripe is after checking the web for info on the 757-200 the aircraft is around 20 years quite old but the planes look it.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
LHR-ASB-ATQ. I travelled with my elderly mother and all I can say is never again. Rude FA food inedible no entertainment aircraft old and dirty. Lay over in ASB a disaster we were made to walk from the plane to the terminal and back again and negotiate stairs covered in ice - outside temperature was -17C. Complete chaos in the terminal when issuing boarding passes. Left to sit on plane with door open as they conducted several head counts of passengers! To make it worse it wasn't even cheap to fly them.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Heathrow to and from Ashgabat and have no major complaints. The crew struggle with English but we managed to communicate without too much difficulty. Aircraft's were clean and tidy and legroom good. There is no inflight entertainment aboard however the inflight catering was rather good washed down with a generous supply of soft drinks. What spoilt the experience was the behaviour of a minority of Amritsar bound passengers who chose to openly smoke during the flight. When approached by the crew those passengers screamed and shouted that they could not understand the crew requests for cigarettes to be extinguished. These passengers chose to play very loud music to the annoyance of those nearby refusing to turn it off. Fellow Amritsar-bound passengers were powerless to stop them.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
LHR-ASB. Busy flight mostly passengers to Amritsar. No inflight entertainment (not even map). No duty free magazine or alcohol. Main food service - tasty curry choice of veg or meat. Crew ok but English not first language. Toilets clean. Over hour delay in take off from Heathrow - probably due to few check-in posts being open. Landed on time. Return flight was not as busy - room to swap seats. Map this time and crew ok and remembered to get me black tea without asking.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
I took the flight from Frankfurt to Bangkok via Ashgabad and I must say it was ok. The flights left on time and there was a transfer time of aprox 1 hr at Ashgabad in the middle of the flight which is quite convenient. The food came in large portions and consisted out of a lot of meat. The personnel was not over friendly. The in-flight entertainment doesn't exist bring your own.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Birmingham to Amritsar via Ashgabat. Check-in smooth and flight left on time. Plane clean and staff could speak enough English to make themselves understood. The drinks trolley came around every hour or so but no alcoholic drinks. There was no entertainment onboard apart from a map showing where we were. Landed on time at Ashgabat airport. The transfer lounge was adequate - we waited approx 90 minutes before we continued onto Amritsar - we sat in the same seats so no new boarding passes were required. We arrived on time at Amritsar. The things I didn't like about this airline were that it was no longer cheap - in the UK they have put their prices up by 50% from last year. Also they don't have life jackets - something that petrifies me as I panic when flying. One other moan I have is that whenever we hit turbulence - and we did quite often - there was no announcement telling passengers to return to their seats and put their seat belts on - children were playing in the aisles as we went up and down!

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
A nightmare journey to Amritsar due to leave at 1350 from BHX. On arriving for check in we were informed the flight was delayed 11 hours - spent all day at the airport. On boarding the flight the staff were rude and unhelpful - not even fully conversant in English. The flight was due to land in Ashgabad for a short break but the pilot took the aircraft to Mary Airport due to bad weather - and left the aircraft as did other members of crew. The passengers were left sitting on the aeroplane for 4 hours prior to it taking off for Amritsar. There were insufficient drinks onboard and we were not able to leave the aircraft. Staff could not update us on when we would leave Mary as they had to wait for another aeroplane to land so they could get back up to full crew. I will never fly with these people again they offered no apologies for the gross mistreatment of the passengers. Never will my family travel with Turkmenistan Airlines again!

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Ashgabat - Dashoguz return on B717. Outbound had interesting boarding arrangements - you get a numbered generic boarding pass (with a picture of an Ilyushin 76 cargo plane on it) and you have to refer to your ticket for your seat number (at least the seat allocation is honoured). Aircraft interior was comfortable and well presented - they now have safety cards but still no sick bags and no life jackets. Picture of the President is displayed on the front bulkhead Small sandwich served and additional items can be purchased at prices lower than those at Ashgabat airport. Landing was not the most confident. Look out for the fleet of Antonov AN- 2s at Dashoguz airport. Inbound also interesting - no conventional check-in counters everyone queues at a plain doorway for security etc. No boarding passes. Aircraft interior was clean and well presented - I didn't use the bathroom but others reported it was not in a good state. Snack consisted of two buns which were so dry they were almost impossible to eat. Both flights were on time. For USD37 return I have no complaints.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
I recently travelled to India on Turkmenistan Airlines. The food was horrible so I advise you to eat something beforehand. The seats were dirty and sweet wrappers were everywhere. There were TV's but they were rarely on. The crew can't speak English and you can't understand them.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Cabin crew on this airline seem not to care at all about security on board. I have recently flown domestic from Ashgabat to Mary and the person seated in front of me refused to put his seat into the upright position for take-off and landing. Even though I asked a flight attendant to intervene she asked the gentleman in vain to comply with security instructions but finally gave up and just walked away. I had to call her again tell her I would report her and the gentleman in front of me to the police after landing until she asked the purser to show up and solve the problem. Another gentleman came back 2 times from the washroom smelling of cigarette. It was so obvious he had been smoking. No one said a thing.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Recently travelled to India on Turkmenistan Airlines. Service is decent but not the best. The food is what you would expect. No entertainment on board so bring a book or some music. Ashgabat Airport is quite clean. It takes about 6 hours BHX-ASB. From ASB-ASRit takes about 2.5 hours. The flight attendants speak mostly Russian or Turkmen so it is hard to communicate with them. Overall you get what you pay for. I think the flight attendants need to know how to speak fluent English and Punjabi and there should be some entertainment on board.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Recently travelled to India and back during the volcanic ash issues. Lots of people complain about this airline but at the end of the day you get what you pay for. Outgoing flight was on time. No entertainment on board something they do need to look into. Food and service is what you would expect from the price of the ticket. The return journey was a little more complicated because of the volcanic ash. Everyone was asked to check in and several hours later the flight was cancelled. They should have phoned everyone not to come to the airport. I was travelling with my young son and 2 daughters which made it difficult. They did provide food water coffee etc and the taxi fare back home to the village when the flight was cancelled. Askhabad airport is now 10 times cleaner than Amritsar.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Turkmenistan Airlines is the worst airline I have ever travelled with. Flight attendants all Russian and Uzbek don't speak or understand English or Punjabi. They are rude whenever customers ask for help with their suitcases or hand luggage. The food is not nice drinks are served loads - every 1.5 hours. Entertainment poor very poor bring your own books magazines and iPods/MP3s. All they have is a screen showing you where you are in the world. The safety manuals are in Russian. If you were travelling to India you would want films music and games.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
There were 8 who flew with this run down company - we were delayed for 14 hours! They overbooked our tickets on our return flight - no apology no compensation - no nothing. Pay the extra if you dont want to be delayed - these guys are a complete joke. Book a company who have a customer service department.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
When there where serve food its seems that there where only one kind or food some screens in the airplane dont work. At Ashgabat its dirty - very dirty. Nobody speak English or also nowhere you can read normal information. On the way back the problems bigger - the seat was broken and when you fly 8 hours on a seat that's broken than you have a problem. The crew dont talk English and many things in the airplane don't work.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
I have flown several times with TA but rarely enjoyed the trip; made worse by the lack of everything one associates with a decent air carrier. They dont have staff who can speak English no particular manners and in general they are rude. No information in English or Hindi/Punjabi on board or at Ashgabad. How one should know what to do or expect in term of time for board? I think they treat passengers with contempt and anger directed towards them; I have witnessed the so call air hostesses being rude. As for the onboard entertainment the less said the better. They make all announcements in some language that not a single passenger understands - I know they sometimes have one air hostess who pretends to speak English but no one can understand as it simply isnt English! The occasional films they show are in Russian and always highly embarassing for Indians. Overall I would rate TA 2 out of 10. You may say why 2 when the whole service is so diabolical. Well they usually let you sit down in a sort of seat and if you dont ask for anything they dont hit you over the head. And also because usually flights are on time. Would you fly with this thing? Well as for me and all my friends and family I much rather take a Maruti from Birmingham to Amritsar (if I had the time) than subjecting myself again to this humiliation frustration insults and torture lasting almost 12 hrs.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Amritsar - Ashgabat on a 737-300 returning on a 757 and 3 internal flights on 717s. Each flight on-time and aircraft were clean. Food on the international flights was Indian vegetarian both ways - very good out of Amritsar quite acceptable coming the other way. Complimentary soft drink and snacks/beer for sale on domestic flights. Departure tax from Ashgabat included in ticket price - apparently this is not the case with other airlines. One or two quirky things - there were no sick bags on any of the flights and safety cards only on the International ones. My complaint is with the International baggage people at Ashgabat who extracted money from me in both directions - on arrival for retrieving my bag from the carousel (it was the only one) and on departure because the combined weight of checked-in and cabin baggage exceeded 20Kg.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
I flew with Turkmenistan early February 2007 from Birmingham to Amritsar. The outgoing flight was 10 hours late at Birmingham but we were not given any explanation what so ever for the delay - apparently it was due to fog in Amritsar? We were given a £5 voucher to spend on food & drinks which bought you a couple of coffees! Food and inflight service was adequate. Return flight was punctual but the temperature on the plane was very warm and therefore most uncomfortable. Despite a requests from passengers nothing was done other then to hand out a glass of water to each passenger. Food on the Amritsar to Ashkhabad part of trip was poor.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Central Asian carrier on which I flew five segments in November 2006. Beijing (PEK) to Ashgabat (ASB) and back a one-way flight from Mary (MYP) to Ashgabat and a round-trip between Ashgabat and the northern town of Dashoguz (TAZ). All flights were on Boeings with 757s on the international legs and 717s domestically. The pilots were allegedly Western-trained and looked Russian but none said a word during my five flights. The planes weren't bad. The seats were maintained and the cabins were clean. There were other signs that this wasn't the Delta Shuttle. The bulkhead wall at the front of each cabin bore a framed photograph of the President For Life. Many passengers paid no heed to any rules about seatbelts or cabin movement. Boarding the plane was all pushing and shoving and the old ladies had the best moves. Aside from a flight map on the 757s there was no in-flight entertainment. The food was standard airline grub and flight attendants were reasonably diligent if unenthusiastic about serving drinks and responding to the call button which the passengers pushed without hesitation. There was no in-flight magazine. Luggage limits were nonexistent but in a country where almost everything has to be imported I was sympathetic. The space on my flight was so oversubscribed that three trucks of baggage were left behind. The stranded bags were to arrive on the next flight with room. Turkmenistan Airlines has no web site. It has no frequent flyer program that I could discern and is not part of any alliance. It serves the major cities in Turkmenistan in the sense that it connects them to Ashgabat. The foreign destinations include London Beijing Moscow Bangkok and Istanbul. Flights through Ashgabat are cheap; flights to Ashgabat are expensive. Turkmenistan Airlines is cut- rate transportation which isn't so bad if your expectations are low.

### Turkmenistan Airlines customer review
Had heard bad comments about this carrier but gave it a chance anyway. It should only be given 1 star. LHR to ATQ via Ashkabat. Check in was the same as any other airline. As soon as we boarded what can I say? Miserable crew standing to "welcome" passengers on board as if they had been forced to do so. I think 95% of the passengers were Indians so TA need to think about having at least 1 punjabi/hindi speaking crew member for announcements. Other airlines do this such as Royal Jordanian and Gulf Air. But with TA it was all in their own language and an attempt in very poor english. No announcement from the captain what so ever. Food was ok not much different from other airlines I suppose. Drinks served soon after take off. TA seriously need to improve their inflight entertainment the map of the flight path just isn't good enough! I personally would not use them again I'd rather pay just a little bit more and fly to Delhi and have some decent service. What makes it worse is that they don't even have a proper office (not that I know of anyway) to put comments forward to. Its not necessarily to complain but more to give "advice" to the airline because they seriously do need to improve.
