### “The service is getting so bad”
The service is getting so bad. We have had our flight times changed on several occasions and the results are very long days or missed flights. They won’t change your flight to something better unless it’s a 3 hour time change. Most connections are lost wit this. They are THE ONLY airline to not allow small dogs or cats to fly from the DR, even with papers. This is DESPITE the CDC  not having any problems with these animals. Worst part is JetBlue office says they don’t allow these animals based upon the CDC. Why not just be professional and stop lying? No other airline does this. And third was what happens just a few minutes ago while boarding. A woman had an appropriate carry on bag and couldn’t find a spot. The ground baggage woman said it needed to be checked. The woman said she need it available with emergency stuff. They had one bin open that had a couple backpacks in it and the owners said they could put their bags under the seat instead to help. The JetBlue worker started to tell everyone to basically mind their own business and she knows what she’s doing and that she had the authority to remove everyone and anyone off the flight, including the woman who said she needed her bag. The JetBlue worker got even ruder to everyone around her telling her it’s not a big deal and will make room for the bag. She angrily pulled the backpacks out and threatened everyone. Everyone in the seats around the situation were shocked at her mouth. This has now become the final straw with JetBlue. Their personnel are not screened properly, their policies are a lie and their profit is more important than customers schedules. We won’t be flying JetBlue any longer. We have other choices and professional companies. We might pay more but JetBlue has gone down the toilet. It’s time to flush.

### "Great, friendly staff"
Not Verified |  Great, friendly staff. My second time flying and Danny made us feel comfortable and helped calm my nerves. Airplane looked new. Any questions we had were answered. No delays etc.

### "delayed for hours with no updates"
Terrible service, delayed for hours with no updates. Then they deliver “food vouchers”, after everything in the terminal was closed. Never flying this airline again.

### "nothing short of appalling"
I was on JetBlue flight B6250 to Europe today, April 20th, and the entire experience was nothing short of appalling. From start to finish, it felt like JetBlue had no regard for our needs or comfort as customers, and we were met with unhelpful and downright rude behavior from staff at every level. The gate employees were dismissive, and the online customer service was just as disappointing. It’s hard to tell whether JetBlue hires rude staff or if they’re simply overworked, but either way, the result is a poor and unacceptable customer experience. There was absolutely no effort made to accommodate us or even show basic courtesy. We were treated like an inconvenience rather than paying customers. I expected much more from a major airline and will seriously reconsider flying with JetBlue again in the future.

### "not have bathrooms in the middle"
Terrible experience on flight from LAX to JFK. Me, my wife, and baby upgraded to the extra legroom, partially because when flying into LAX there was a bathroom in between the “extra room” seats and “first class”. Sadly, this plane did not have bathrooms in the middle. It was 1 bathroom in first class and 2 bathrooms all the way in back. I wanted to use the restroom and change my son, so I went up to the first class bathroom. The waitress was coming down the aisle with food for first class so I scooted into an unused first class seat until she passed. While holding my baby, this female first class flight attendant came over and told me that I can’t be up there. I told her “I was waiting for the bathroom and to change my baby, it’s occupied” and tells me no, and says go to the back. It’s not my fault there is no bathroom in the middle of the plane, and if the closest bathroom happens to be through the first class section then how can she possibly have a problem. We weren’t disrupting anyone, baby was quiet and being rocked, but no, this first class staff decided then that this is the line and turned away baby and I. I did have to walk from section 15 to the back of the plane in order to change his diaper. Once again, it’s not my fault the closest bathroom is through first class. I did pay extra 500$ for the 3 of us to have the extra room. So really all that gives you is a couple inches and a pack of tates cookies. We usually like JetBlue, but this woman is making me feel like I’m a scammer taking advantage.

### "unable to file a claim"
Not Verified |  The worst service overall. Boarding pass information is completely unavailable and staff are super unpardonable and down right mean. Our bags got broken on our flight and we were unable to file a claim for broken baggage because of their office hours. Not an ounce of compassion. Had multiple errors on the boarding passes with incorrect terminal information and times! Unbelievable for how much they charge.

### "taking customers for granted"
Having a delay is one thing. But keep us informed when you do have a delay. Sitting for over 3 hours while the intended flight crew goes to another airport. They cobbled together a flight crew hours later. We do get an apology as we waited even longer in the plane. This discount experience wasn’t worth it. Next time I’ll wait a few days and take Breeze. I’m tired of JetBlue taking its customers for granted. Maybe offer us a drink for our hours long inconvenience. I doubt it. I just hope we get home.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  I called customer service because we paid for be comfort on seats 4B and 4C and we never were comfort because both seats can not reclined (broken) and both tvs were not turning on either. Was our flight from BQN to MCO. How is possible that the answer was we are not given compensation for a service that we do not receive? Very disappointed. We paid for a service not received.

### "things have gone way downhill"
I hadn't flown Jetblue in several years and I remember it being a decent option for the price. But things have gone way downhill. Check in experience in Bozeman was poor - no option for quick bag drop so line was an hour long even if you were already checked in. No wifi or movies on flight. Flight delayed going out of Bozeman due to baggage loading issues and baggage unloading at Logan took 1.5 hours. The wait for bags was longer than I have experienced in 40 years of flying. As a result of delays, I missed train and bus options out of Logan so needed to taxi to Providence. Cost $125 and Jetblue would not budge on reimbursement. If you want to save a few bucks and have a miserable experience, Jetblue is your airline.

### "Terrible counter service"
Not Verified |  Terrible counter service at check in and not helpful in any way. My passport wouldn’t scan at the kiosk upon checking in. We were directed to the check in desk to remedy the situation. The incompetent clerk could not assist in manually entering my information thus canceling my flight and week long vacation. I explained that i had been using this same passport for years and showed her many countries stamps within, including 2 from the Dominican Republic. She insisted my passport was damaged. Will never fly or recommend this airline again.

### “one of the worst airlines”
Not Verified | JetBlue is one of the worst airlines, they constantly cancel flights for no apparent reason. Their pilots won’t land because of “weather” when you can clearly see every other airline landing with no issue. Their flight attendants are surly and unhappy looking, at best.

### "be prepared for problems"
Not Verified |  I decided to give JetBlue a chance over United and Air Canada for their nonstop JFK-YVR Mint service, but the experience has been frustrating on both ends of the trip. On my outbound flight from JFK to YVR, we departed late, and the Wi-Fi didn’t work for over an hour. The crew repeatedly told me it would be fixed “soon,” but it never was. On my return from YVR to JFK, JetBlue called me (and many others) to the gate because their system couldn’t verify our passports. I had already checked in online without issue, so I don’t understand why this problem surfaced at the gate. The incoming flight from JFK is already late, pushing our departure back. Given how late yesterday’s flight was, I suspect this delay will only get worse. Unlike United and Air Canada, JetBlue seems unprepared for basic international operations. I was willing to give them a shot, but between tech issues, unreliable Wi-Fi, and delays in both directions, I can’t justify choosing them again. If you’re considering JetBlue for this route, be prepared for problems.

### “Media Screen was not working”
Not Verified | I was on a four and a half hour flight from Aruba to JFK on Saturday, January 18th. I had seat 14B (Aisle). My Media Screen was not working, no video or music was available to me for the entire flight. I informed the flight attendant of the situation and she responded that there is nothing she can do about it. I just spent 25 minutes on hold with Jet Blue and the escalation dept. I was told that they used to give out credit for $15 dollars but that was no longer the policy, I was entitled to nothing. The representative then had the audacity to thank me for being a loyal Jet Blue customer. I told her yes I am loyal to you, but you are not loyal to me. My wife and I fly Jet Blue all the time, we are now looking into Delta as our airline of choice.

### "given E and F boarding group"
Not Verified |  I don't know who is operating the website between the Boarding Pass is printed out it does not reflect the true information. Almost as a Mosaic in my last three (3) trips I was given E and F boarding group instead of B group. As Mosaic it doesn't give Mosaic group but C. Customer Service does not help, letters are not being answered to. Very sad because this is not what is being promised at the time I am buying the tickets.

### "I will never book with them again"
Not Verified |  This was my first time booking with JetBlue, and it will definitely be my last. I booked a flight from Denver to Philadelphia with a connection in Boston. Right before boarding, we were informed that the flight was undergoing maintenance and would be delayed by 30 minutes. However, an hour later, we were told they were still working on the issue. Another hour later, they finally announced that the problem with the aircraft was more severe than initially expected. I immediately asked the gate staff to reschedule my flight, but they couldn’t find another one for two days. I was told the best they could offer was to cancel my ticket and provide a full refund. No additional accommodations were offered beyond the basic refund. In the end, I had to book a last-minute flight with American Airlines, which cost $1,000 more for me and my partner. When I asked the staff if there was anything they could do to help, all they said was “sorry.” I will never book with them again!

### "the absolute worst"
We arrived an hour and twenty minutes before departure. Kiosk did not work. We waited in line for 40 minutes for kiosk assistance. By the time we got there they said it was too late, we had “missed” our flight by a matter of 6 minutes. Thanks to the kiosk assistance line. Had to reschedule for a flight 8 hours later. And we ended up paying twice over (an additional $270) for our checked bags from misleading advice from the JetBlue staff. They still have not refunded it. I’ve flown 30 times on many different airlines. Domestic and International. This one’s the absolute worst. We opted for Spirit instead. They treated us so much better than JetBlue staff.

### “experience was incredibly disappointing”
Not Verified | I recently flew JetBlue from Heathrow (LHR) to JFK, paying nearly £5,000 for a business class ticket. The experience was incredibly disappointing. First, online check-in was not allowed, forcing passengers to arrive over three hours before the flight. At the airport, seating was allocated on a first-come, first-served basis because the flight was overbooked, and they were even offering incentives for passengers to take the next day's flight. This is completely unacceptable for a premium fare. Once past security, it got worse. Despite charging a premium for business class, JetBlue does not operate a lounge or partner with any existing lounges at Heathrow. Passengers were left without the expected comfort or services. Overall, the experience was a mess, and the customer service fell far below expectations. For anyone considering flying JetBlue on this route, I’d strongly recommend looking elsewhere. Avoid the airline.

### "the worst travel experience"
I paid for two luggage's one of them was my regular 23kg bag and the second one i paid $50 for taken a 50" tv with me, but then at the airport they said, they do not take boxes on aboard, so then they said they will refund the $50 that i already paid for a second luggage, they took my luggage ticket as a proof but never refund my money, now i call them and they said they have no record about this issue, they wont refund my money. First i called them to ask if i can take a tv in the box with me and they said yes, at the airport they said no, i paid $50 for nothing, i only traveled with one bag and never refund my money. Airplane is terrible, seats cannot recline, they don't give a cup of water, this is the worst travel experience.

### “had amazing flight attendants”
Not Verified | Had a great, smooth flight and had amazing flight attendants (Carrie and Wendy) who were helpful the entire time even when I had an unexpected nose bleed.

### "behavior was not just unprofessional"
I was on flight B6 183 #0183 from JFK to MCO. Since I rarely fly, every trip to the airport feels like a new experience for me. During the flight, I went to find the bathroom and saw a flight attendant, sitting in front of the restroom reading a book. Unsure if I was in the right place, I politely asked her if this was the bathroom. She stopped reading, glared at me with an annoyed expression, rolled her eyes, and sarcastically said “yes,” making it clear she was bothered by my question. I then asked if someone was inside. Instead of offering a simple response, she sighed loudly, pointed at the “occupied” sign without a word, and made me feel completely humiliated for asking. Her attitude was condescending and dismissive, as though I was wasting her time. I felt uncomfortable, unwelcome, and downright disrespected. Her behavior was not just unprofessional; it was outright unacceptable. As a business owner, I understand the importance of frontline employees in shaping a customer’s experience, and her disgusting attitude is a direct reflection of JetBlue’s standards. Someone with such hostility has no place in a customer-facing role. Her attitude made it abundantly clear that she does not want to be there and has no interest in treating passengers with basic decency. JetBlue, this is not just a training issue; this is a staffing issue. She does not belong in this role, and needs to be removed. If JetBlue cares at all about its reputation and customer experience, it must act swiftly to ensure this kind of treatment never happens again. Do better.

### "customer service is not good"
Not Verified |  Their customer service is not good. I had to change my ticket and I sent them an email within 24 hours telling them I needed cancellation. They didn't email me back for help. Days later I learned how to cancel my ticket online. They didn't refund the full amount because I didn't cancel within the 24 hour window.

### "seats extremely uncomfortable,"
JetBlue has an app that claims to give live updates. Did not update us about the change to our gate. No in app notification, no text, no call. By the time we figured out they had moved plane to another gate in another terminal we were late to our connecting flight. They refused to offer us a voucher for accommodations for the day until we could catch the next flight at night. The previous flight we took was a red eye with the so we were dead tired and extremely frustrated. Plane seats extremely uncomfortable, and don’t recline.

### "They are absolute garbage"
I booked a flight down to TPA for my 33rd birthday and a relative of mine who came up to visit for the event, fell quite ill to the point I did not want to leave them until their significant other was available to get them. Asked kindly to either have my original flight refunded or if they could do a longtime customer an exception for such and all I got back (via some broken English from a “escalation” team member) that I would owe a $100 for cancelling and would then have to pay a whole new fare. They are absolute garbage

### "I will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  The hostesses were extremely rude. One of them deliberately bumped into my leg while walking down the narrow aisle. I’m a small person, and my hands and legs weren’t sticking out from my seat, but the hostess was a large woman. I’m not sure how she could even work on a small plane like that every day. She forced her body into me as she passed, which was noticeable to several passengers. Then, she began shouting new rules at everyone, including telling people, 'Do not sleep with your head on the tables. This was the most bizarre rule I’ve ever heard. In all my years of traveling across states and countries, I’ve never encountered anything like it or such rude service. Not mentioning the food or the entertainment and Internet that never works. If you are on a long flight to another country, you are on your own for hours with not entertainment, no one tries to fix the TV or provide another seat. It appears nothing is being repaired for these planes. JetBlue used to be a reliable airline, but since COVID, it seems like they’re no longer focused on hiring professionals, properly training staff, or even monitoring the service they provide. We all pay a significant amount for our tickets, and we don’t have the luxury of moving around in cramped cabins, especially now with more rows and chairs added, making the space even more narrow. The least we can expect is for airline staff to treat passengers with respect and kindness. Instead, I’ve noticed an increasing number of angry, rude employees, particularly with JetBlue. After this experience, I will never fly with them again.

### "Never, never again"
Not Verified |  Never, never again. Got to the airport 2 hours before the red eye flight and there was no staff at the baggage claim. Boarded the plane on time at 11:10pm PST and was deplaned after 1 hour on the plane moments after being told that there was a 40 minute delay for mechanical issues. 4.5 hours later (4:30am) they canceled the flight and rescheduled it for 16 hours later. Returned the next day for the rescheduled flight and they were delayed again by 1.5 hours. The second delay caused a missed connection of which was rescheduled already once. This entire process has shown that JetBlue has a lack of communication, urgency, and courtesy for their customers. A flight voucher does not give time or money back. Don’t ever fly unless you have nowhere to go and 4 days to get there.

### "not recommended to anyone"
Not Verified |   I am a lady over 70 years old. I usually travel with JetBlue to Boston to see my son and granddaughters. On Oct. 25th, 2024 at late night I booked a flight to see them. The next day I called to cancel it because it was going to Ottawa with a one-hour stop. I had a very bad experience last year going to Montreal and then to Boston, with a two-hour stop in the middle during the customs immigration process by a delayed flight. So, I called Jetblute on Oct. 26th, the next day, and was on the phone for over one hour to talk to a representative to cancel my flight, but all the time was a waste of time, and couldn't talk to anyone. I was so tired of that. On Monday, Oct. 28th called again and they said they could give me a credit for a year to use it. On the other hand, I already have a $50 credit that couldn't use. It's so hard for me at this age to go through these. So, this time is the last time I use Jetblue. and not recommended to anyone.

### "I will never use JetBlue again"
First time using JetBlue, and I will never use it again. Absolutely. Horrible going there. From New Jersey to Florida was not bad, stewardesses were nice. Everything was smooth and on time coming home was the worst. I've ever experienced at an airport. I had to wait an hour and a 1/2 at the airport, and then we boarded, and we had to wait 2 and a 1/2 on an airplane with no air conditioning. Stewardesses were rude and it was just the worst experience ever. I will never use JetBlue again.

### "frustrating and emotionally distressing"
I’ve always had high expectations from JetBlue, but my experience on May 22, 2024, during my flight from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale was nothing short of frustrating and emotionally distressing. Upon realizing my last name was incorrect on the booking, I approached the front desk for assistance minutes before boarding started. Instead of helping, the agent wasted time, making me believe she couldn’t do anything. After a long delay, she finally told me to call customer service. I resolved the issue over the phone, finishing the call minutes before gate closure, but the agent coldly judged it was too late and denied me boarding despite having ample time to fix the problem. I had to pay hundreds of dollars for a new flight with another airline, which was completely avoidable if the agent had acted with professionalism and urgency.

### "Terrible customer service"
JetBlue emailed me multiple times that the flight would be delayed by 2.5 hrs. So, after checking my email and seeing no notices, I arrived at the airport later since the flight was delayed. Well, they apparently un-delayed the flight and I never got any notice. So I lost my flight. I call JetBlue and an ill-mannered staff refuses to make things right. I end up having to book a last minute flight for 24 hrs later and paid $300 extra. Terrible customer service and refuses to fix their mistakes. Never fly JetBlue.

### “This experience is absolutely unbelievable”
I had to fly into Boston today for a quick turnaround trip…same day. During the course of my flight this am, my subsequent time in Boston, and then my walk/trip back to gate C28 for my JetBlue flight #835 - I have had an extreme flare up in pain in my left hip (hip replacement in May). I am not sure what has happened, or what the problem is, but I am trying to soldier through and just get myself back to MSP near my family. I had no reason or idea that this was going to happen today unfortunately and was caught by total surprise. I asked at the gate if I could possibly get a seat closer to the front of the plane, which they graciously granted and placed me in Seat 4B. Upon getting on the plane, I noticed the row 1 C/D side was open. I sat in 4B and subsequently asked the flight attendant Tracy if I could move to that row, so that I, number one might be able to stretch out a bit more, as well as not have someone next to me who would be subjected to my tears etc. just some privacy to deal with this issue as best I possibly can. She went to the front to check with the other attendant and came back and said, no sorry that is a pd upgrade seat. Ok I understood. But had been hopeful under the circumstances an exception could be made. I would have gladly paid to upgrade but that was not offered. Perhaps not possible with JetBlue, not sure. Upon my pain getting even more intense during the flight, I once again summoned the attendant to let her know how much I would have appreciated being moved, as I was extremely uncomfortable. She abruptly marched to the front of the plane, called the captain, came back and loudly announced in a very authoritative voice, the “The captain said if we are causing you pain, we need to immediately divert this aircraft. And repeated it again even more loudly. I was mortified, A)that she would loudly announce this to everyone seated around me. I NEVER said they were causing me pain. I most certainly did not need the plane diverted, I was shocked! I Just asked if perhaps I could be accommodated to try to help me bear this flight the rest of the way out. B)I cannot believe she made such a spectacle. If anything, I just needed a gentle soothing voice asking me if there is anything else, perhaps Tylenol, ice etc that she could offer to try to help me. I was even more upset than previously after this. I made a trip to the front to privately let her know how she had made me feel, trying to explain the gentle touch that would have made such a difference, she then interjected to tell me (a 10-year Delta employee) how there is a “way to ask” and “you demanded you be moved to the front row”. I seriously could not believe what I was hearing. I told her, I can’t believe you just said that, don’t even suggest such a statement because I most certainly did not say that at all. I was then told “Get out of my galley and return to your seat”, upon which I complied. and requested a customer service supervisor meet me at the gate upon landing in MSP. My seat mate in seat 4A said she would gladly verify that I most certainly did not demand and politely simply asked if it might be possible. So basically, because she perceived me “demanding” to be moved, she allowed me to ride out the entire flight in 4B and could, evidently have moved me, if I had only asked in a different manner. This experience is absolutely unbelievable.

### "flight attendant was extremely rude"
Not Verified | JetBlue flight 1407, JFK to Paris, date 10/5/24, flight attendant was very rude. We paid for extra leg room in the emergency exit, we sat in our assigned seats initially however the flight was not a full flight therefore a female flight attendant told us we can move to the seats in the seats in the back of us, which was also extra leg space. Throughout the flight, another flight attendant was extremely rude. He did not bring a cup an ice as requested neither did he brought napkins that was also requested. We reminded him about our request. He replied that we are even lucky to sit where we are sitting. He was trying to be insulting as his defense talking about our seats. I kindly said bring your machine if you want to charge extra, money is not an issue here as doing your job is. He needs not to be in the customer service field.

### "terrible customer service team"
Not Verified |  Jetblue is a terrible airline. I am disabled, but the flight attendants do not care at all. I had a terrible experience where I actually fell and hit my head while trying to put my shoes on after going through security. In the process of doing this, I had torn my shorts. I had no idea until one of my children (I had both with me) pointed it out as I was boarding. I entered the plane and asked the first flight attendant that I was disabled and my pants were torn so bad that there was everything showing. He told me to go to the back of the plane and I could change in the restroom. I headed toward the back, as I was instructed (the plane was boarding and filling up) but I was stopped by a very nasty female flight attendant. She told me that I couldn't use the back bathroom. I told her what had happened, but she laughed at me and told me "you're going to have to the the one at the front of the plane. Good Luck! I started crying and begged her not to make me walk with my backside exposed through the plane, but she laughed and ignored me. I went up front crying, and everyone was pointing and staring at me. Later, when serving soda, the same attendant came up to me and told me that I was rude because I was crying. Then, I told her that I would file a complaint and she laughed. She told me good luck, again. The thing is, she wasn't wrong. Jetblue has a terrible customer service team. No one would help me at all. I was told to take it to social media by the "customer service rep" and so I did. Their response was whoops, sorry. They won't talk to you directly, they won't do anything to make it better, and trust them (they forwarded my concerns). Then they quit responding all together.

### "amazing legroom"
I checked in the day before on the JetBlue app, no hassle whatsoever. Arrived at JFK two hours prior to my flight, it was very crowded and took about 40 minutes to get through security. Boarding was done very fast and flew on brand new plane N3221J which had been delivered two weeks ago to the airline. Everything was sleek and new, tons of content to choose from on the inflight entertainment, free wifi, free snacks and drinks and amazing legroom on this two hour flight. Crew was professional but not so friendly aside from that it was a good experience on this short two hour hop to the Windy City.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Worst airline ever. Avoid at all costs. The online managing of the trip doesn't work. Spent 45 minuted waiting to "chat" with agent without resolution. Can't check in, had to do it at the airport. Got overcharged to check in a bag because of that. Inflight Wi fi does not work.

### "JetBlue experience was terrific"
Not Verified |  We flew with JetBlue and Turkish Airlines back in early August. This trip was super important to my fiance and me because it was his first time seeing his family in three years. Unfortunately, our first connecting flight to Boston was delayed, and we would not make our next flight, ruining the whole trip. This trip could've taken a horrible turn and not happened at all. However, Alex, a JetBlue customer service agent at the airport, came to our rescue! She was super knowledgeable, understanding, and caring about our entire trip. Alex was able to help us through this stressful situation and change our flight schedule so that we would be able to make it to our final destination. During the process, she gave us every option we could choose, along with what had happened the past couple of days so we could make an informed decision. Alex also answered all 100 questions my fiance had about changes being made and confirmed time and time again that we would have our luggage and tickets for all flights. After working with Alex, our international trip was as smooth as an international trip can be! Our JetBlue experience was terrific, thanks to Alex! Sadly, JetBlue will no longer be at Charlotte Airport, or we would be repeat customers!

### “they said they couldn't help us”
Not Verified | We got delayed more than 4.5 hours, they said that we would get a credit at the airport and just to call it in before 60 days, I just did today and they said they couldn't help us, they're liars, they were short on personnel that's not our problem.

### "entire experience was traumatic"
I am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with the treatment my family and I received during our recent travel experience with JetBlue. We were unjustifiably removed from the boarding line by a JetBlue supervisor, which caused significant distress and inconvenience. Upon arriving at the airport, we went through security and proceeded to the gate. Unfortunately, there was a gate change and ground delays, and we were not notified of this gate change via the JetBlue app or by text message. Despite checking in (before TSA ) and receiving our boarding passes, we were informed that the gate would be notified of our approach. However, upon arriving at the gate, which was still open with boarding in progress, the on barding crew member chose to yell at me and greeted me with "its closed". I then proceeded to tell them it's still open- the sign said boarding - so the supervisor allowed us into the line they even scanned our boarding pass. Because we were visibly upset at the way they were treating us (lacked emotional awareness, empathy, and intelligence) Something about my demeanor didn't rub the supervisor the right way and he kicked my husband, infant and I out of the line. He didn't care the gate had changed and we weren't notified, he didn't care we had a child and it was already an evening flight, he didn't care I was mosaic, he didn't care I was on time. It was his time to use his supervisor badge and assert his "authority". This was a deliberate act towards my family. The staff's attitude was both rude and lacking in compassion, further exacerbating an already stressful situation. We were ultimately rerouted to another airport at a later time, which caused additional inconvenience. Which by the way - he did not help us set it up. He actually looked at us in the eyes and said "I aint helping you. Figure it out. This entire experience was traumatic and reflects poorly on JetBlue’s brand, which is known for prioritizing customer service and care.

### "my case was denied"
Not Verified |  I purchased four tickets for my family to Newark and in my way back, flight was delayed three times, and at 11:00 pm, flight was cancelled. I came from a cruise, have no family member in NJ, and sleep in a hotel fof two days and I ended up purchase another ticket with allegiant that cost me $1335.07 , car rental $256.12 and Uber $216.00, and parking for my car at Tampa airport where I left my car $200.00. I have a master card with JetBlue which came an insurance, but my case was denied. See below email from JetBlue I just received. Hello Herold, We sincerely apologize for the disruption you experienced during your JetBlue flight 873 on 2024-08-06. We appreciate the opportunity to address your reimbursement request. Upon careful review, we regret to inform you that JetBlue flight 873 does not meet the criteria for reimbursement as this disruption was uncontrollable.

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to providing you with a remarkable travel experience on your next JetBlue flight.

### "the worst airline ever"
Absolutely the worst airline ever, as a frequent traveller using the best and also the budget friendly airlines I have to rank Jetblue under even the budget. Sure you can tack on for everything- something Jetblue has done just like the budget airlines. The attitude of JetBlue both on board and CS reflects a very bad atmosphere going on there. CS I have to rank an absolute 0. Not the first time I have had issues with them- but no more - I have given up my flight credit and ff miles and will never fly Jetblue again. The circumstances surrounding my delay/emergency landing/re-book were absolutely hideous! Jetblue can blame others for the issue but they are the ones to blame in the way they handled it.

### "poor treatment and unhelpful staff"
I recently had an incredibly disappointing experience with JetBlue Airways that I feel compelled to share. Despite arriving on time, my pregnant wife and I, along with our two small children, were not allowed to board our flight. This ordeal was not only highly stressful but also completely unacceptable. The gate agents were unhelpful and showed a complete lack of empathy towards our situation. Traveling with a pregnant woman and two babies is challenging enough without having to deal with such unnecessary obstacles. JetBlue's handling of this situation was appalling. We made it to the gate on time, yet we were turned away with no reasonable explanation. This level of customer service is simply unacceptable for an airline that claims to value its passengers. I expected much better from JetBlue and will think twice before booking with them again. If you're considering flying with JetBlue, be prepared for the possibility of poor treatment and unhelpful staff.

### "Worst travel experience"
Worst travel experience, my flight was changed 10 times since this morning. This is not a serious airline. I called the customer service and spoke with Karla and she said that she didn't have a reason why my flight was changes many times in the past few hours

### "smiling crew was so positive"
I have flown Jetblue many times. I like their timeliness, service, customer-friendliness and ownership they take to solve issues. In my recent travel, I liked that they had a booth, titled JUST ASK, with live agents for customer questions. I was not assigned a seat while booking, so when I asked the agent in this booth, they were extremely polite. The agent at the terminal gave us excellent seats in the front with extra leg room without any additional charge. The whole experience, check-in, spacious seating, space for carry-on luggage, boarding, snacks, cleanliness and smiling crew was so positive, I told quite a few people and if I have a choice, I would go with JetBlue again--my first choice. My only suggestions-- provide earphones so passengers could watch/hear movies and shows. Also, movie and TV show choice was limited.

### "the worst travel experience"
I recently had the absolute misfortune of flying with JetBlue, and I can confidently say it was the worst travel experience I’ve ever encountered. The flight was delayed by an unforgivable 40 hours due to a situation that was entirely JetBlue’s fault — a fact they even admitted. However, this was just the beginning of a nightmare that no one should ever have to endure. First off, the customer service is beyond atrocious. The representatives were rude, unprofessional, and completely indifferent to the chaos they caused. It was like dealing with a bunch of heartless robots programmed to give you the runaround until you finally give up. Their WhatsApp support is a joke—automated responses that lead nowhere, and if you’re lucky enough to reach a human, the call mysteriously disconnects. They don’t even have a proper landline, which is just another indication of how little they care about their customers. They charge you for seats and baggage online, but when you arrive at the airport, they try to scam you into paying again. It’s disgraceful and unethical. The seats on the plane are uncomfortable and faulty, and the so-called “food” is revolting — hardly edible and not worth the price they charge. As if that wasn’t enough, when the delay happened, the staff knew from the start it would be 5 hours, but they posted just a 1-hour delay on the boards. It’s clear they were trying to manipulate us into staying at the airport longer. And when it became obvious that we wouldn’t be flying that night, they refused to provide us with hotels, transport, or even food vouchers until we literally had to fight for it. The level of disrespect and lack of care for their passengers was unbelievable. This airline treats its customers like caged animals, showing absolutely no regard for their comfort or well-being. The entire experience was disgusting, and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. I have already warned my entire network to avoid JetBlue at all costs, and I strongly urge anyone reading this to do the same. JetBlue is a scam wrapped in an airline, and they should be ashamed of the way they operate. Do yourself a favor and never fly with JetBlue. They don’t deserve your money, your time, or your trust.

### "seats were very comfortable"
Flew on my birthday to Chicago and decided to use some trueblue pints I had for this flight. Check in was done on my phone on the day of the flight I did have to wait about 15 minutes in line to drop my luggage off. The flight itself was pretty fast 1h50mins. Snacks were provided along with drinks. The plane itself was on the older side but seats were very comfortable. Unfortunately the TVs didn’t work so I pulled out my iPad. JetBlue still had good service on this short domestic flight.

### "really disappointed in this airline"
Not Verified |  Jetblue might be the worst airline I have ever flown. I fly quite frequently and Jetblue is usually the cheapest option however the amount of hassle and stress this airline has put me through is not worth it. The past 5 flights I have taken with Jetblue 4 have been delayed by over 2 hours and 1 was fully cancelled. The fully canceled one had us sitting on the tarmac for 2 hours trying to "find a route" (there were storms). They then returned us to the gate and told us we could get off the aircraft if we wanted to stretch our legs (Mind you this flight was supposed to leave at 5:45 pm- the time was then 10 pm). Once off the aircraft, they prevented us from going back on to take our seats again. After one more hour of waiting to return to the aircraft - they decided to cancel the flight. The time was now 11 pm. But DONT WORRY, they gave us a $12 voucher for airport food. I really disappointed in this airline. I will be looking at other options in the future.

### "a terrible company"
My flight has been canceled and Jetblue didn't offer any alternative. They said I had to spend one more night in New Orleans and find another flight by myself the next day (all the flights for the same day were fully booked even with other companies). I missed worked on monday, I spent an extra $100 for a hotel, an extra $50 for a taxi, extra money for food, and an extra $270 for a new flight. And Jetblue refused to give me a refund for that. They didn't care at all. They are neglectful, and the customer service is terrible. The customer service closed the chat without my consent. Just because I was showing her she didn't respect the regulations made by the department of transportation. They'd rather cut off the conversation when you know your rights. They disregard the regulation and they make their own rules. Flights are always delayed or canceled with Jetblue. It's a terrible company. Avoid it because your trip is gonna cost extra money because of them.

### “simple and hassle-free”
Not Verified | Jetblue provided simple and hassle-free travel including comfortable seats, excellent service and reliable flight times. Would highly recommend this route.

### "Nightmare customer service"
Nightmare customer service. My flight was cancelled after I cleared security and none of the Jetblue staff at the airport will help. They direct me to a web portal that is broken, from an email with a broken link. Then the customer service chat or phone call takes over 2 hours. When I got to a customer service representative, they tell me the next flight will only be in 3 days. 3 days that I will have to spend - without compensation for food or accommodation (because this isn't the EU) in one of the most expensive city in the world on a short notice. The customer service will play you like a tennis ball. The airside staff told me to speak to the staff at baggage reclaim, the baggage staff tells me to speak to the staff at check-in, the check-in staff says I need to call the customer service line. The customer service line barely helps me with what the rebooking portal in the app was supposed to do instantly. All throughout, nobody would give me a reason on why my flight was cancelled. The rebooking portal is broken for unknown reasons, and that is hours of my life that I will never get back. The only reason I am flying the rebooked flight is because I need to get to my destination for work and to catch my long haul return flight. I will never be a JetBlue customer ever again in my life if I can help it.

### "never fly with JetBlue ever again"
Not Verified |  Our plane was supposed to leave at 8:40pm, got to the airport at 7:00pm. The plane was rerouted to another airport, they said due to weather (meanwhile it was raining yes but not bad not lightning or anything). When the plane arrived they had everyone come to the gate, the lady gave passengers seat numbers if they didn’t have one already then someone came up and shut the door (this was at 1:20am). They said the pilots have timed out, ok mind you there was another plane going to palm beach as well that was rerouted to another airport as well and they were supposed to leave at 5:30pm but that plane didn’t arrive in Ny until about 12:45am and those pilots timed out as well. They found pilots for the plane that was supposed to leave at 5:30pm but not for my flight. The next flight they had going out to Florida wasn’t until Tuesday in all airports in the surrounding areas. On their website it says they’re supposed to help with hotels and a food voucher if it was a controllable situation which its was if they were doing their jobs properly but they refused to give us passengers anything. Also when they finally cancelled the flight I was like 4th or 5th in line and they didn’t even say anything about stand by seats, but gave it to customers that were way farther down in the line. They are very unprofessional with the way this whole disaster was being handled. We had to purchase more tickets for a different flight with a whole different flight company to get home that following days. Was at the airport for 17 1/2 hours before we got on the plane to come home. I will never fly with JetBlue ever again. They really need to get it together because they had multiple planes pilots time out that same evening at different airports. Oh also the insurance was purchased as well with JetBlue

### "last time I will purchase from this airline"
I flew from Vancouver to JFK and then from JFK back to Vancouver On both occasions the flight was delayed by 2 hours and 1 hour respectively. No reason was given. Why is it now 6 hours and 15 minutes flying time instead of 5 hours? Totally unacceptable. This is the last time I will purchase from this airline

### "never be flying with them again"
For years JetBlue was my preferred airline. JetBlue cancelled my direct flight and rescheduled me for a flight with a connection over a day later. They refused to compensate me for the downgrade, which was merely the cherry on top. I am writing a day before my flight and have had to cancel a job, costing me $350 in lost income. The delayed arrival will cost me 5 hours in lost time and I will be responsible for purchasing overpriced food at the airport. Even though they made the decision to cancel the original flight, they refuse to make me whole. Despite having requested $500 in compensation for all losses incurred, I would have been happy to spend many multiples of that amount with JetBlue prior to this episode. Now that they have shown an attitude of total disrespect and lack of concern for the passenger, I will never be flying with them again.

### "extreme dissatisfaction"
I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the abysmal service I received from JetBlue on Sunday, June 23 2024. My flight from New York City to Albuquerque, scheduled for 8:00 PM that evening, was unceremoniously canceled without any notification or updates from Jetblue. This unacceptable lack of communication left my friend and me stranded at the airport overnight, forced to sleep in the terminal due to your negligence. It wasn't until we took matters into our own hands and contacted customer service the following day that we were able to secure new flights for Tuesday - a full two days later than our original itinerary. To add insult to injury, our rebooked journey involved an unnecessary and inconvenient layover in Seattle, further prolonging our travel time. We finally arrived in Albuquerque at 7:00 PM on Tuesday, a staggering 47 hours later than initially planned. Jetblue's failure to provide timely information or assistance during this ordeal is inexcusable. We incurred additional hotel expenses on Monday night as a direct result of JetBlue's mishandling of this situation. Yet JetBlue refused to reimburse our extra expense.

### "no offer of refund or assistance"
Not Verified |   Difficulty with schedule changes impacting trip and jet blue customer service inaccessible with phone service/staff unfriendly and unhelpful. No offer or compensation for changes. No assistance to loyal members. Missed flight due to gate change. No notice on app or email of change and no offer of refund or assistance with impact to customer. Told to bad. Loyalty member for several years with 37,000 points list and no recourse. Staff rude and unprofessional

### "JetBlue is a terrible airline"
JetBlue is a terrible airline. I needed to be in New York to catch a connecting flight to London. Our JetBlue flight kept getting delayed until it was delayed passed the departure time of my connecting flight. Then they cancelled it without explanation. I was told they would rebook it and to check my emails. In the meantime I had to get a hotel room and rental car beyond my original plans at my cost. I decided to call later and I found out that they rebooked all the flights for the next day. That means I was forced stay yet another night at my expense. They told me they do not reimburse for these costs that were not my fault. They told me there was a flight but at 5:45am. I basically said they were useless which they are. I called another airline who rebooked me, but for a better time. ! !

### "first and last time flying Jetblue"
We flew round trip from Phoenix to Boston. On the way there the flight attendant told us the infant we were traveling with was required to sit in a middle seat due to safety reasons, on our way back the attendant told us the infant has to sit next to a window for safety reasons. The staff don't seam trained very well. Also on our return flight I accidently purchased an extra check in ticket on the kiosk, the bag handler confidently told us we can call customer service and get a refund after we land as long as the tag is not scanned. After landing we called and they refused to refund me for the accident, and both the agent and the escalation specialist I spoke to confirmed that their crew in the airports are not trained on their policies. For an wealthy airline that does not allow carry on, and charges for every checked bag, this was ridiculous. I flew with 5 other passengers, and this is our first and last time flying Jetblue.

### "Generally not worth the hassle"
JetBlue cancelled the first leg of the flight from Buffalo to New York (then connecting to London), they said due to bad weather. Staff tried to be helpful, but the next flight was the day after. No help for a hotel room, no support for food/drink, basically nothing at all. Flights are very often delayed, chaos with permanently changing gate. You get dozens of emails about your flights being changed back and forth - before eventually getting cancelled. On board it's ok-ish. Great is wifi and life tv, good legroom. Otherwise low cost standard: "free snacks" until they run out, food is not great. Small aircraft for overseas flight, everything is dated, rotting and not clean. Smallest bathrooms I have ever seen. Generally not worth the hassle.

### "Got scammed for $450.00 dollars"
Not Verified |   Got scammed for $450.00 dollars when JetBlue changed my daughter's trip to Disney with her 2 sons aged 4 and 7 and her husband when she looked and saw the itinerary had been changed and the return leg of their round trip tickets had the parents separated from the children, I, the grandfather purchased the tickets and had the kids sitting with the parents and having 2 window seats. When JetBlue decided to change the flight they separated the parents from the kids on the flight. When my daughter called and tried to get them back together they told her there were only 4 seats together and it would cost an additional $450.00 dollars to get them safely back together. She had a choice, cancel trip or pay the extortion fee of $450.00, she got absolutely no help with customer service nor did I having spent about 2 hours of being jerked around and finally speaking to a resolutions manager and getting no sympathy or offer to change or remove the fees for the changes they made. First time and last time dealing with this airline, betting this is a common occurrence and a nice sleazy way to get more money from people. Be careful booking with these people they have no interest in making your trip anything other than a money grabbing affair, great way for us to start our vacation.

### “cant believe the greed of this company”
I really cant believe the greed of this company. I had a vacation to mexico with my daughter from the 5-9. Unfortunately there was a Hurricane and had to change dates, not due to my choice or personal matter, but due to a natural disater. My departure was with AA and they changed my tickets dates without a problem. However my return was with Jetblue and I had to cancel my tickets to get a petty $80 credit on $350 tickets. Had to repurchase for a later date and spent $380 without luggage of which the previous flight included. Stop being so petty especially with your customers in a situation which involved a natural disaster.

### "Lost a long time customer"
JetBlue cancelled my dad’s flight with no explanation as to why. Rebooked on their own for 2 days later for a time that was not convenient, when I reached out to customer service to rebook to a different airport (closer to my home) and a time convenient for me, after waiting for two hrs one hr for regular customer service and one hr for escalations was told that they were very sorry for the inconvenience but that there was nothing that they could do. Was told I could cancel get reimbursed and buy a new ticket in the airport I wanted which would have cost me triple the amount of the original price. All I wanted was to change the airport (same airline) since they cancelled his flight but was told they couldn’t do it. JetBlue does not care to accommodate their customers for inconvenience caused by them. Just heard news that due to traffic control staff shortages in JFK flights had to be cancelled, delayed or redirected to different airports so don’t believe the “weather conditions” excuse. Shame on JetBlue for not valuing their customers. Lost a long time customer in me, my family and anyone I can spare the headache!

### "I am thoroughly disappointed"
Not Verified |   I want to share my disappointing experience with JetBlue. My flight from JFK, scheduled for 2:10 PM on June 30, 2024, was continuously delayed and eventually canceled at 3:01 PM, with no explanation provided. Several other JetBlue flights to different destinations were also canceled, clearly visible on the monitors. The delay of the Miami flight was attributed to a shortage of crew. It is evident that JetBlue does not value their customers' time, impacting their ability to spend time with loved ones. I am thoroughly disappointed with JetBlue's service and have no intention of flying with them again, nor will I recommend them. Despite my previous positive experiences with JetBlue, my last three flights have all been marred by extensive delays.

### "Super disappointed"
Not Verified |   Delayed for 6 hours. Super disappointed with this airline - they don’t even offer anything to you to make you feel happy. Don’t think I’m going to travel with them anymore. Not even 50 dollars to buy food

### "Delayed flight three times"
Not Verified | Delayed flight three times for a total of 12 hours. The last delay was while we were on our way to the airport and got in too late for it to work. They refused to refund enough to pay for a last minute ticket on a competent airline. Never again.

### "so considerate and helpful"
My day started horrible with Jet Blue, in Seattle there is a lot of construction, I was told by the airline I flew into Seattle on to arrive at least 4 to 5 hours early because TSA lines are extra long because some are closed due to the construction. Well I got there 5 hours early to sit at the Jet Blue desk waiting to check my bag for hours because there was no customer service representative until 2 hours before the flight. So at 9:15 am finally someone arrived. Today June 14th there was a lot of storms that delayed flights. So I was unable to make my connection flight to Philadelphia, Victoria in Jet Blue baggage service was so helpful and made this high stress travel day end on a great note by helping get my bag in a very timely manner, set me up in a hotel and was just so considerate and helpful through the whole process. All of the woman in Boston Baggage service for jet blue was all very helpful and you could tell they was passionate about their jobs.

### "don’t let families sit together"
Not Verified |   Worst airline ever. Worst crew members. Even when there are million of seats empty they don’t let families sit together by moving them on the empty seats. Worst customer services. Never take this airline

### "a nice experience"
Not Verified |   Aside from the hour delay leaving EWR due to bad weather, my roundtrip flight from EWR to TPA and back was a nice experience with JetBlue. The crew was friendly, the aircraft was clean and comfortable, and I even got the luck of chatting with the pilots.

### “unprofessional and disrespectful behavior”
Not Verified | I recently experienced offensive behavior from the JetBlue staff at Heathrow Airport, which caused me to have an anxiety attack in front of the entire airport. Additionally, we were flagged for further travel that day, making the situation even more distressing. The unprofessional and disrespectful behavior needs to be addressed to prevent similar incidents in the future.

### "Customer service was very poor"
Not Verified |   I flew JetBlue from Paris to Boston with a stopover in JFK. The seats were comfortable, had many entertainment options, but food was not as good. Customer service was very poor. I ended up getting delayed at JFK because staff said they needed to wait for an aircraft that was late arriving at JFK. I asked JetBlue help desk about standby on an early flight, and said I would likely not be getting on that flight. I highly advise not flying JetBlue though JFK, as I have always been delayed, and staff are very rude. If you fly JetBlue, I highly recommend flying through Boston instead of JFK.

### "Window seats were especially cold"
Not Verified |   During the flight the AC was set on a very low temperature. Probably JetBlue believes it is a smart marketing move to sell as many 10-dollar blankets as possible. That is so obvious. Window seats were especially cold. I am afraid my wife will get sick because of that. When a flight attendant was asked about it she said that they had just brought it up a moment ago. Pretty cynical. No shame

### "Very bad service"
Not Verified |   Very bad service. Tickets were purchase for additional money to seat in front. Went to airplane after people who set at the back. They did not have enough space for our carry on. They had to check it in. Lost so much time to get my bags. Makes no sense to buy tickets for extra money to seat in front.

### "Bye bye jetBlue"
Booked for a direct flight from Orlando to Nassau, Bahamas, which left later than scheduled. The flight was short enough that the crew served water, soft drinks, and snacks only. The A320 was old, and showed its wear on most surfaces and scuffed seating surfaces. The entertainment screens mounted on seatbacks did not work. At all. There was no wifi as advertised. But the crew was friendly, and the flight was smooth. Upon our arrival, we retrieved one of two checked bags from the baggage claim area. I spoke with a very helpful jetBlue representative in baggage claim, who discovered that our second checked bag was still in Orlando. With all of my beachwear, hats, dinner clothing, snorkel gear, medications and my cigars (addiction gladly acknowledged). I asked the jetBlue rep when the bag would be delivered, and she stated that it would be on the only flight scheduled on the following day. She told me who to call at jetBlue central, which I did to no avail. Upon our arrival in Nassau, I bought enough clothing to let me visit the beach and eat at restaurants. 28 hours after our arrival, the lost bag was returned. After returning home (on a different airline), I filed a claim for reimbursement from jetBlue for the clothing. It took two weeks of promises, terminated phone calls in the middle of conversations, and way too much of my time to pry my money out of the hands of the penny pinchers at jetBlue. All to pay me what the U.S. Transportation Dept. said they should pay me. Life should be spent on a beach, in the mountains, at a good bar, with your family ... go ahead and join in. But you shouldn't spend an unreasonable amount of time getting an airline to live up to its promises. Bye bye jetBlue.

### "won't refund you for an unused service
We purchased 4 tickets, prepaid for 3 bags, but the hotel we left them in misplaced one. We requested a refund at the counter and the man there told us to contact customer support, which basically told me "bad luck - we don't care, we won't refund you for an unused service

### "customer service has been trash"
Not Verified |  This will be the last time I fly with Jetblue. I booked extra leg room for my son and I months ago, it was about $400 seats/taxes/fees. I receive an email today that they moved our seats. They separated my minor child and I by rows and also put us both in the middle. There are other open extra leg room seats in the emergency row (my son is not legally able to sit there due to age restrictions) and yet they separated a parent who paid for seats together at a higher rate instead of putting adults in the emergency exit seats. I called and sat on hold for almost over 45 mins to be put on hold again to the escalation department just to be told "we can do that" and eventually the man in another country hung up on me. The customer service has been trash. I can't believe they'd separate a parent from a kid even with the cost of extra leg room and not move adults elsewhere or at least refund the cost of the seats since the airline moved and separated me from my child. But no, just bad customer service and SOL. I'll never fly Jetblue again. Doesn't matter if you pay for extra leg room, book way in advance, this airline doesn't care.

### "will never trust Jetblue again"
Missed our connecting flight due to a delay they caused, because they twice changed the times between flights, the last time two hours before it left. When I went to the help desk, I was told the plane came in on time so it was my fault for buying a ticket that didn't leave enough time between flights! Any time there is going to be a delay you could say it came in on time if you change the previous flights departure time to later. They continue to say the plane was on time. It was not according to the schedule that was supposed to have come in over an hour earlier. They charged us $75 EACH to put us on a flight to LAX instead of Ont where we had paid more to go to since we have no way to get home from LAX. That flight to LAX broke down and we ended up waiting 6 hours in all for a new plane to take us to LAX where we didn't want to be in the first place. We got in at 3:30am, and had no way to get home. Finally got an Uber home for over a hundred dollars. Had no food, they gave us vouchers for twelve dollars, but all the stores closed at 10:00, and we were given the voucher at 10:15 PM so there was nothing to eat either, and nothing was offered free on the delayed flight once we got on. It was a nightmare, and all we are offered is a $75 credit for a future Jetblue flight, which will never happen. They keep saying the plane was on time, but only because the flight was changed twice, once at the last minute, then we were told to go to the wrong gate, which was also printed on our ticket. When we ran there the gate had been changed to gate sixteen at the other end of the airport. We made it -just barely, we are in our late 70's and nearly died trying to get there, but although the plane was still there, they would not let us on. They proceeded to charge us $75 each to change the ticket to go to LA where we did not want to go, and shouldn't have had to go if the first flight had left on time. All the agents say is that the plane came in on time and it was our fault for purchasing this flight with not enough time. It was the flight Jetblue gave to our credit card travel to sell to us, and had the times not been changed twice it would have been fine. There is no help or no one who seems to think that this is totally wrong on all counts and we will never trust Jetblue again. Waiting 6 hours in the airport was horrible. No food. Before that we were afraid to leave the area in case they called us to board, which they did do, but after standing on the jetway for 25 minutes they told us to go sit down again because the plane was not ready. Then just to add to the misery, our luggage was at Ont and was only available to be picked up between 9:00pm and eleven pm. We are old and can't drive at night and had no way to get it. This seems absolutely illegal for them to CHARGE us to change a ticket that was their fault for being late. They didn't even try to delay the departing flight for us, even tho there were others who came on our plane that were also stuck. Nor did they have any sense of taking blame for what was obviously their fault, instead blaming US for buying that ticket, the one that they gave our travel agent to sell to us, and then proceeding to twice change the time between flights, which we had no control over. Not to mention the cat that got loose in the plane after we finally took off! OR the trip flight that looked as though we were flying to Russia!

### "$65 charge for a carry on"
Not Verified |   Never again will I fly JetBlue, booked on Expedia, didn’t mention anything about carry on item fees. Guess what we get when we get to the gate, a $65 charge for a carry on.. for that price I’ll pack an entire suit case worth of things instead of a carry on. Thanks for the heads up JetBlue. After an hour delay due to the jet not being on time then there was maintenance issues with the jet before boarding. All was was 5 minutes later so we boarded, get on board doors close, ready for push back, nope! Can’t close the cargo door, another maintenance delay. I highly discourage flying JetBlue.

### "not be flying this airline again"
Boarding order is the oddest I have experienced on any airline. I had a seat towards the front but was one of the last groups to board so by the time I boarded I could only put my carry on approximately 10 rows behind me which meant I would have to wait for others to deplane before I could retrieve my luggage. While I struggled to find space in the overhead bins, I received no help from the flight attendants for some time before someone finally helped me. This flight was also delayed but I understand that can happen to any airline. The plane also just seems older than other airlines. There was no USB port with each economy seat and the controls seemed older. At least there is free wifi. There was also trash in the seat pocket at my seat which I found unappealing. With this experience, I will not be flying this airline again and would not recommend.

### "Excellent start to finish"
Not Verified |  Excellent start to finish. Most importantly good legroom, food and entertainment which is all you should expect in economy. Really efficient cabin staff. They are so much better than the big airlines now.

### “ a positive experience”
I hadn't flown on JetBlue for years and was happy with this flight. Check-in at their terminal at JFK was easy and quick, as was checking baggage. I was surprised to receive an email that my bag was successfully loaded onto the plane. Terminal 5 is attractive and well-organized, with many good places to eat, shop or just sit and relax. The plane was full and boarding was slow. The plane was very clean, and seating was spacious. Unlike some other airlines flying across the country, the selection of entertainment on JetBlue was excellent, with free movies and free wifi. Snacks were good and beverage service was generous. The flight attendants were caring and professional. Although the flight left almost 30 minutes late, we arrived at our destination only 7 minutes behind schedule. Deplaning was slow. By the time I got to baggage claim, my bag was waiting for me. Overall, a positive experience with JetBlue.

### “Poor explanation and poor notification”
Not Verified | The worst experience and treatment by an airline ever. 4am departure delayed 4 times at the airport with finally a postponement to 6pm because captain needed rest. Had to leave airport with luggage with nowhere to wait so rented a room to sleep. Rescheduled connecting flight via phone then flight was further delayed making it impossible to make connection a 2nd time. Another hour on the phone to get a flight out of Orlando the next day then flight was moved again forward to a time we could have made the connection. Once we arrived again at the airport the flight was again delayed. Poor explanation and poor notification. Told we could check on arrival to see if a room voucher might be possible. Lots of happy chatter from captain and crew which was out of place. Never again.

### "This is very disappointing2
Not Verified | I did the virtual check in which states no carry on/bags allowed so I paid to check 5 bags. When I got to the counter I was told I did not need to check my bags because they were small enough to take on the plane. Let the gentleman know the website said we were unable to take bags on, he states that is only bigger bags but that it is not specified on the site. We did not end up checking our bags and took them on the plane with us. The gentleman stated we can call JetBlue and get a refund. I called this morning and was told, too bad no refund. The check in website is very misleading and I did not use the services and now I'm told oh well, you already paid. This is very disappointing and should make people reconsider flying with this airline.

### "Horrible experience"
Employee in San Juan Puerto Rico assisting boarding flight B6 1634 need more training on how to be professional. He was very disrespectful toward me. I am traveling because a family member passed away and the last thing I need is for an employee to mock me. The staff used the speaker to let know customers that if you were in group F you needed to go over him, because the carry-on needed to be checked in. I went over and he explained that I needed to pay. I let him know I did not know and I had flown with JetBlue before and I thought the carry-on was free. He proceeds to tell me that I have to pay $65 or upgrade the seat. I asked how much it was to upgrade the seat and he started looking for pricing and responded that the price was $90. I understand that he is doing his job, and I understand that I needed to pay, but why make the additional comments and treat a customer so badly. I would never travel with Jetblue again. Horrible experience. I can not support a company where their employees do not show empathy to their customer.

### "absolute worst travel experience"
The absolute worst travel experience I've ever had. Our connecting 10pm flight was cancelled so we went to the service desk to figure out lodging for the evening. We were told they were not handing out hotel vouchers, however we would be reimbursed up to $250 per person. They then placed us on standby for the next morning. When returning to the airport the next morning, we had to re-pay our baggage fees and were told our standby position had not been held and we'd lose our spot and be put on standby at the end of the line due to the prior service desk agents errors. Luckily, we were able to make the flight regardless of the lost spot. However, when attempting to be reimbursed for a $120 Uber ride to the closest available lodging and a $400 hotel bill, we were told the flight was not eligible because it had been cancelled due to weather. The flight had been cancelled due to no pilot being available but we were informed that he was delayed due to weather so we were still ineligible for reimbursement despite being told by the service desk we'd be reimbursed. We attempted every method to get reimbursed and were met with incapable, unhelpful agents who simply repeated the same thing and did not care that we were lied to by their agents. Horrible experience and we have not flown JetBlue since and never plan to.

### "I did not qualify for the credit"
I booked flight 1436 from San Francisco to New York, which was scheduled to arrive at 1:37 PM. However, due to mechanical issues, the flight was delayed until 3:23 AM the next day. I was offered by a JetBlue staff to be assigned to a different flight, flight 1936, which arrived around 8 PM. This means that I arrived more than 6 hours later than my original arrival time. When I spoke to the agent about a credit delay, I was informed that I changed flight and therefore I did not qualify for the credit. I was referred to the JetBlue Customer Service Plan1, which states that customers whose flight is delayed 6 hours or more due to a Controllable Irregularity are entitled to a $200 credit. However, the plan also states that customers who voluntarily change their flight are not eligible for compensation. I find this policy unfair and unethical, as I did not voluntarily change my flight, but accepted the offer that JetBlue made to me in order to avoid further delay and uncertainty. I do not think that I should be penalized for taking the option that JetBlue provided me. I believe that I deserve the same compensation as the customers who stayed on the original flight, as I experienced the same inconvenience and frustration.

### “never had a bad experience with customer service”
I have been a frequent customer of jetBlue's for the past 20 years and my past experience reaffirms my commitment to come back to them. I understand how people criticize the airline for delays, and I have had my fair share of delays on jetBlue, but I have never had a bad experience with their customer service. Every jetBlue employee I have interacted with has been nothing short of amazing. In terms of the hard product, the legroom can't be beat and their updated IFE makes sure there's something for everyone. If somehow theres nothing in the IFE for you, the FREE wifi has always been a perk I enjoy, and it was the first airline I can think of that offered this about 6 or 7 years ago. jetBlue has never done me dirty enough to swear off of them, so I plan to keep on flying with them for the foreseeable future.

### “Awful as of late”
Awful as of late and disrespectful towards long time/frequent customers. I've been flying with JetBlue for over 10 years, for the first time in those 10 years I had to cancel or at the very least modify my flight to a different date, JetBlue refused any kind of consideration towards waiving the steep cancelation/modification fees, even though I did not request a refund but simply a travel credit for a future date, extremely disappointed in how poorly they would treat a long time customer, especially given their multiple delays (still sore about an 8 hour delay out of Boston this summer for which no compensation was offered) and other service deficiencies as of late. Will be switching to Delta for my frequent travel between San Juan and Boston.

### "the seat was completely broken"
Purchased a Mint seat (one way) $1,474 + tax (SFO to JFK). Got onto the plane only to find out (in the air) that the seat was completely broken - no recline, bed, functionality at all. I notified the flight attendant, was told to call Jetblue and she would make a note that the seat was broken. Apparently that didn't happen. After multiple correspondence with Jetblue (phone calls & chat), I was issued only a $200 travel credit with no additional ability to contest this. The Operations associate implied that there was no proof because the flight attendant didn't make notes of this issue and this credit was “a courtesy.” The Escalation associate said that in the, “carriage contract, they cannot guarantee your seat works and $200 travel credit is the only thing they can do.” Sad that you can spend that amount of money and you're not guaranteed to get what you paid for. In addition, Jetblue will no longer fly to my local airport (BTV) in less than 2 months, so I would have to spend even more money just to try to use that credit at another airport - it’s pretty much useless to me now. Been a loyal customer of JetBlue’s so I’m very disappointed that they don’t stand by their product and purchasing a Mint seat is risky.

### "determined to be ineligible for compensation"
Not Verified |  Jet Blue's Policy states that they will pay $600.00 in the case of a flight delay of 7 hours or more. Received this reply from JetBlue after a 7-hour delay. The JetBlue gate agent told everyone the plane was at JFK with no crew to bring it to Newark, NJ for the flight to Tampa: "The concern you sent to the Department of Transportation has been received by JetBlue's Executive Offices and we appreciate the opportunity to respond. We're sorry to hear of your disappointment on Flight #573 from Newark (EWR) to Tampa (TPA) on June 28, 2023. Our records indicate that your flight was delayed over 7 hours due to a combination of reasons including the late arrival of the inbound flight, insufficient ground time, maintenance, and equipment change. We have a team that carefully reviews these disruptions and we regret that the flight was determined to be ineligible for compensation based on the uncontrollable nature of much of the delay. Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience. JetBlue's Policy states that Jet Blue will pay each passenger $600.00 in the case of a flight delay of 7 hours or more.

### "pay an extra $300 to rebook our flights"
Not Verified |  We had tickets from Los Angeles to Seattle booked and they cancelled the route. The e-mail said that we could rebook on Alaska Airlines but when I contacted them they said that because we were in their basic economy class they wouldn't help us. We ended up having to pay an extra $300 to rebook our flights due to the change in airfare from when we originally booked.

### “experience was nothing short of a nightmare”
Not Verified | I am writing to share an appalling experience my family and I had with JetBlue. On the day of our travel, we arrived at the airport at 03:00 with my spouse and two young children. Despite having a booking confirmation and ticket information at hand, the airport personnel couldn’t locate our booking in their system. We were stranded at the airport, with our little ones, for an excruciatingly long time while they pretended to rectify the issue. To our dismay, the solution offered was to send us to another airport for a flight scheduled 5.5 hours later. We were promised a lunch, but upon arrival, were handed mere vouchers of $12 per person, hardly enough for a run to grab a bottle of water. Moreover, despite assurances that we would be seated together on the new flight, we found ourselves scattered throughout the plane, seated at the far end. The sense of security and comfort one seeks while traveling with family was ruthlessly snatched away. Our ordeal didn’t end here. The flight we were transferred to, initially set for 02:30, was further delayed by over two hours, making our departure time 10 hours later than originally scheduled. The indifference and rudeness of the staff added salt to the wounds. Their lack of empathy and sheer disregard for our situation, especially with young children, was glaringly obvious. The experience was nothing short of a nightmare. The lack of professionalism and human decency displayed by JetBlue’s staff was abominable. It’s disheartening to see such a level of indifference towards passengers’ well-being and utter disregard for customer service. This ordeal not only disrupted our plans but also added a layer of stress and discomfort to what was supposed to be a smooth journey. The way we were treated is unacceptable, and I hope no one else has to go through such a horrendous experience.

### "The absolute worst airline"
Not Verified |  The absolute worst airline. Delayed for more then 10 hours. Made me miss my connecting flight. Had to stay in line for 3 hours to be connected to the most ignorant workers which replaced my flight and then cancelled it once I left. If British Airways didn’t give us a free flight we would have been stuck because of this terrible company. They also lost our luggage.

### "This airline it’s outrageous"
Not Verified |  The worst experience ever with JetBlue, first when leaving from Boston to Orlando flight was delayed more than an hour, now I am going back to Boston flight 2952 is delayed than I decided to change flight to leave early and now the flight 52 is even more delayed and they have no flight attendants. This airline it’s outrageous, I paid $150 to change the flight for nothing. Thank you JetBlue, I will never flight again with the worst airline. My time and money is valuable for me.

### "unbeatable service that day!"
Not Verified |  I was stunned by the service I received when I left my Passport in my hotel in New York after arriving at JFK. Unable to think straight and racked with anxiety the two Jetblue staff assisted me to order another Uber which was very hard early in the morning, they rang the hotel and organised the hotel staff to collect the passport from the safe in my hotel room and liaise with the Uber driver to drive it to the airport. As the Uber approached the terminal one Jetblue staff came with me to the road and directed the Uber through the traffic to where I was standing on the sidewalk. I made my flight! Thank you Jetblue - unbeatable service that day!

### "I am furious at my treatment from this airline"
Not Verified |  I know this is long but please read this review in full. I am absolutely livid at the experience I received and the absolute lack of regard for not only their own policy but their customers. 9/25/23 - We booked a 3 hr flight from Boston to Chicago, scheduled departure time 5.35pm ET (flight B6 811) -The flight is perpetually delayed. Last officially updated delay in the JetBlue app was 9.54pm, 4.5 hours from original scheduled departure. However, despite boarding at this time, the plane sat on the runway until 10.35pm ET, a full five hours after scheduled departure. The reason for the delay, according to the flight's captain, was a mechanical issue with the engine of the original plane we were supposed to take. We ended up switching to a different flight coming in from Orlando, which did not even arrive until 8.45pm. 9/26/23 - We arrive at O'Hare around 1:30am, ET/12.30AM CT. As soon as I arrive at my destination I contact JetBlue's chat line requesting a travel credit given the delay. The woman I spoke with me assured me a credit would be issued once the flight was reviewed. - Per Jetblue's official policy, flights delayed by 3 hours are issued a $50 travel credit and an additional $50 is added per extra hour delayed up to $200. Given that this flight was delayed by five hours until take-off, proper compensation should have been $150. Even if going by the last official time of departure, 4.5 hours late, it should have been $100. - Instead, I wake up that morning to find I only received a $50 travel credit. - I use JetBlue's chat support line again to request additional compensation to reconcile the discrepancy between what I was given and what I was owed given JetBlue's own policy and the length of the delay. - Ginette tells me the flight was delayed by only 3.5 hours according to the investigation log and that she is unable to provide further compensation. When I ask why the investigation log is inaccurate and send the screenshot from the JetBlue app showing that the last updated time of departure is over 4 hours after original scheduled time, she simply repeats like a broken clock and tells me there is nothing she can do. - I ask to speak to a supervisor, to which she tells me that she is a supervisor. I ask to speak to her supervisor, and am transferred back to Ginette. She then tells me I will need to call JetBlue's line and request a supervisor. Ok fine. - So, after very little sleep on account of this delay, I call JetBlue's customer service line where I am transferred to the escalation team. - I speak to Jonathan on the escalation team who tells me essentially the same thing, the flight was delayed by 3 hours, there was no delay code in the flight, and their ops team has already reviewed the flight and determined it is only eligible for $50. When I asked why the flight says it was only delayed on their end by 3 hours when it actuality it was far longer, I am told he doesn't know and can only go by what he is told on his end. - Here I am now with only a $50 credit on a flight that should have received at least $100, if not $150. I am absolutely baffled as to why a company as large and as profitous as JetBlue would refuse to honor their own policy and extending an additional $100 credit towards customers who were delayed by five whole hours except for an all consuming avarice and absolute soulless apathy towards the paying customers who give JetBlue its revenue in the first place. I am furious at my treatment from this airline.

### "customer service is horrible"
Worst company I ever had, customer service is horrible, not even a smile, you feel like you’re bothering them, super slow. Get in the flight, not able to get AC then after 15mins we had to get out of the plane due to a fuel tank problem. They were unable to find a plane in replacement, had to wait many hours at the gate without any compensation. I recommend you to avoid this company, they shouldn’t be able to be a company.

### "they wanted us to buy a new flight"
JetBlue doesn’t seem to mind jettisoning their cancelled fliers into the abyss the “Help” desk. (if they haven’t actually closed it down after you and 199+ passengers have been seated on a plane for 7 hours on the tarmac and then JB cancels and deplanes all passengers ). The freshly trained “help” crew just stare at the screens and can’t find you anything so just go sit and wait. Our janitors will sweep you up if we find you wilted and neglected in a corner on the floor. They should call it “No notice “ “No Help” Too Bad, So Sad airlines. We don’t notice how inept we are, we don’t notice you either. But we’re damned grateful you are so patient. Because, what is that motto we have plastered everywhere in our jolly blue lobbies? We love to help. Helping’s our favorite”. Their favorite way of helping is to give you a boarding pass that has not been registered so when you are at the gate to board with a ticket in hand, they tell you they can’t find your res and close the flight door, or, get you another res and cancel it 2 hours before you fly. No stress there? 9/9/23 boarded flight 3:30pm from jfk to sfo. Taxied out for an hour, ultimately sat on plane, taxiing in and out twice, for 7 hours, then after profusely thanking us for our good behavior and unending patience, deplaned us all. The gate agent assured us that within 3 more hours we would get an email informing us of our replacement flights. We all understood that weather in the west was causing a great deal of problems. We did understand what a shit show this was going to be for everyone including JetBlue. No such email came, ever. All that came was an email informing us that the flight was cancelled with a link to “manage your flight” that sent the user around in circles or telling them they weren’t eligible, or weren’t covered or whatever. Phone calls had a wait time of 547 minutes, text links 2 hours. If one tried to reserve on this link, by the time all info was entered, the flight was unavailable. Help “ desk was empty, no agents anywhere. Airport was closed for business in JetBlue terminal. Oh, by the way, you can’t leave this terminal area or you won’t get back in because your flight is cancelled and you will have no boarding pass to go anywhere, anytime, got that? So stick around so you don’t miss some phantom flight. A group of us heard that a “crew” was coming in to the help desk at 4am. At 4:15 am, 3 young freshly trained folks came out to man the long “help” counter because “helping” is their favorite thing to do. As a group 15 + of us had pulled up chairs to sit in because we could hardly stand any longer, having had no sleep or food, a JetBlue supervisor told us we couldn’t sit there, it was a safety hazard. Fainting in the aisle from exhaustion is not a safety hazard? Some of these people were 70 - 80 + in age, and we ultimately stood in line 3 1/2 hours. It was impossible to “manage” any flights with JetBlue through the link they gave us, basically they wanted us to buy a new flight that, if you got that far, required you to buy a seat in addition to the ticket, seats and tickets where the prices were rising as one scrolled the pages as if they were in live auction. Even if you tried to buy a ticket at inflated prices, by the time one entered all required info, when you pressed the “buy” button, the response was “sorry, we sold your seat”. Hey, we can make some serious bucks off of these nice patient folks!

### "totally uneducated to solve problems"
Not Verified |  I am completely disappointed with this company, get out of them, everything happened to go and come back, total lack of respect for customers. I bought my flight precisely for the arrival time at my destination in Punta Cana which would be 10.30 am, this way I could make better use of my vacation days, however, my flight was scheduled to leave Boston at 6.35 am on 01/09/2023 and arrive in Punta Cana at 10.30 am, but JetBlue only said it was late, we waited a long time, until we boarded, we spent almost an hour on the plane before we got off again and waited a long time for another boarding, at the end of it all I only arrived at my destination, it was already past 6 pm, I lost an entire day of my vacation. Day of my return which was 08/09/2023 from Punta Cana to Boston with a stop in NY and arrival in Boston, such was my surprise when I arrived in NY the flight that was to leave for Boston at 10.50 pm was cancelled, the staff giving vague answers, they said that our flight to Boston would only leave the next day at the same time, that if we wanted we would have to wait more than 24 hours and that JetBlue would not pay for the hotel, I saw many people indignant, without answers, with much insistence they put me on a flight at 3 am, to get to Boston, when I arrived in Boston my suitcase didn't come, after a lot of searching for information they said they would deliver it to my house, 2 days later. Avoid this company, because if you have problems they are totally uneducated to solve problems, I hope I never have to fly with JetBlue

### "have never seen such level of incompetence"
Not Verified |  My elderly parents booked this airlines to fly from the US to India and had a horrible experience. Firstly their flight was delayed multiple times through out the day so my aged parents were stuck from morning 3.00 am in the morning till 9.00 pm. Because of the delay my parents couldn’t make it to their connection flight. Finally when the crew rescheduled they had only less than 2 hours to transit at the Heathrow airport. When I called the customer support to request for a rebook, the supervisor yelled at me. When I raised my concern’s regarding the transit yet again I was met with least concern over their age or even any solution. Despite sharing the fact that my parents have some hearing issues as well so they might need more time in transit, the agent was least concerned about it and was growingly impatient. I have never seen such level of incompetence or lack of concern for customers. I expected a little empathy from those in service industry but seems like they don’t care. I have never seen such level of incompetence or lack of concern for customers. Please don’t be a customer of the airlines.

### "no longer want to travel JetBlue"
My elderly parents and 16-year-old daughter went to Jamaica for my uncle’s funeral. Our flight was delayed multiple times. We were finally scheduled to depart at 7:07pm, boarded to staff who appeared less than enthused with their jobs. We eventually began taxiing the runway, however, due to a drunk passenger we had to return to the gate. After the intoxicated passenger and family were removed, the captain advised us that the runway closed at 8p.m. and we would be placed in hotels overnight. The passengers were upset and began to complain about this situation, some had work the next day including myself and other responsibilities. Adults would stay at The Riu Montego Bay and families with children under 18 would stay at the Riu Negril which is approximately 1 hour 15 mins without traffic. We arrived at the hotel at 11:50 p.m. to 1 person checking in customers. This process took 2 hours. The following day we boarded an earlier return flight with unfortunately the same crew. As we boarded the flight, I heard an FA say, “did you just roll your eyes at me” and my 16-year-old daughter response was yes. I turned around and my daughter said I gave her side eye. The customers began telling the FA that she’s unprofessional arguing with a minor giving her a look she did not like. The FA stormed to the front of the plane stating that she planned on “kicking someone else of the flight today”. The passengers could not believe this and began complaining that the FA should be removed from the flight. No other staff approached me to inquire what occurred. I no longer want to travel JetBlue.

### "Last time I will ever fly this airline"
My husband and I travelled from Tampa to Boston and took a road trip to Maine. On our way back to Boston for our flight home, 4 hours from our scheduled flight, we get an automated phone call that our flight was cancelled. I call customer service and am told there are no flights with Jet Blue to Tampa, Sarasota, or Orlando in the next few days. We had no choice but to accept a refund and book a more expensive flight through another airline the following day. Both the customer service line and a JetBlue supervisor at the airport assured us that they would reimburse us for our hotel and would reach out to us within a week to ask for our receipts. We booked the cheapest option within 30 minutes of the airport, which was over $300/night. Weeks go by, and we never hear from JetBlue. I finally call and am told to submit a request through their website. 2 weeks later, I receive an email from JetBlue basically telling me no payment will be made. This whole ordeal cost us $600 between the hotel, booking another flight, and keeping the rental car for an extra day. JetBlue’s assurances mean nothing! Last time I will ever fly this airline!

### "The worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  My mother booked a flight months ahead and ended up having a stroke. JetBlue stated she’s only entitled to an E-ticket and not a full refund. I advised them she will no longer be flying and she had a major stroke. I spoke with a representative last week who advised if I sent in supporting documents that she would be entitled to a full refund. I had the case manager type a letter and I submitted it via the email that was sent prior to attach the documents. I called today to ensure they received and spoke with two escalation representatives who stated unfortunately she’s only entitled to a refund. The worst airline ever.

### "No one cares one bit about customer"
Not Verified |  Our connecting flight was canceled 10min into our flight from SJO. Upon arrival in FLL we had wait 2hrs in line with 300 others who were canceled to get new flight info. 2 Agents at counter. While in gate area 3 agents sitting at an info booth no one there! How about send two out to help with brewing disaster at cancelations? So after 3hrs we have new flight for next day. Without care in world that two RDU flights on other airlines had departed while waiting. Next day now another full check in and guess what? Flight delayed! Finally 35min late we are finally on way home. A whole lost day of travel, food expenses etc. This is same thing that happened to us 18 months ago. Same flights! How can Jetblue keep that flight slot(flt2626). It performance is abysmal after I looked it up. So did any agent care at any point? Not one apology. No Travel Credits. Nothing. After two times. And we are JB travel members. No email responses from anyone. No one cares one bit about customer. Would really put them out I guess to treat paying customers correctly . So no more Jetblue. No more Jetblue card. Move on. I do know they deserve merger with Spirit as they are now one in the same!

### "a near perfect economy RT flight"
It's "Economy" (with miles and free checked bag with credit card). Very nice seats, friendly service, and a non-alcoholic drink and snack for a 2.5 hour flight. DCA-FLL RT. Check-In staff were very nice about the baggage allowance in that they helped tag the bags when they saw we had trouble. My Boogie Board was on the cusp of their size requirements but they checked it without fuss. I had to shuffle around some weight in one of my bags to get under the generous 50 lb limit. Internet loaded but was effectively unusable for me on social media but the entertainment options were vast so it didn't matter. Seat size was generous and comfortable and everything clean. We got seated together for free in advance because we have a 7 year old. My family always has a great time flying this route for the past 15 years. Will ding 1 star for problems with the internet, but otherwise a near perfect economy RT flight.

### "won’t fly JetBlue ever again"
Not Verified | You cannot force people to pay to check their bags and not have people available to actually check the bags. We discovered at check in that our fare did not include a carry on bag adding $150 to our overall fare (slick bait and switch JetBlue). So we arrived early expecting a line to check our bags, only to learn they only man the desk between certain hours. We had to wait in the lobby of the airport for over an hour to check our bags. Companies call this lean staffing in the name of reduced pricing, but really what it is is a way to sneakily cut services while charging the consumer a higher rate through hidden fees. With the unanticipated baggage fees the price of this trip was the same as all the competitors but with drastically reduced service and significant frustration. I won’t fly JetBlue ever again.

### "Staff unprofessional"
Not Verified | Avoid to use JetBlue to fly to the Dominican Republic: Never on time. Staff unprofessional as well as bad attitude when traveler asking questions regarding late flying. | Evite viajar a Rep. Dom. por JetBlue: Nunca a tiempo. Personal poco profesional y mala actitud cuando el viajero hace preguntas sobre vuelos tardíos

### "was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  We booked a one-way ticket with American Airlines but knew that Jet Blue would be operating the flight. I didn't have high hopes but was pleasantly surprised. Jet Blue use the newly renovated Terminal B at LaGuardia which was easy to navigate and had some great seating areas as well as shops and restaurants. The plane itself wasn't in the best shape and the seats were covered in a cheap looking plastic material that reminded me of a taxi. However, the flight crew were attentive and gave out free snacks and drinks throughout the flight. The on-board TV screens were great for a short flight and we arrived with no fuss into Orlando well ahead of schedule. For the price paid I couldn't find any fault with Jet Blue.

### "Dismal service by Jetblue"
Not Verified |  I am currently in the middle of the was the worst travel delay I have ever experienced (12 hours and counting). I am being optimistic that we will leave in the next couple of hours - otherwise I'd give one star. I was supposed to leave Orlando on flight 1586 at 4:10PM Aug 16th. It is now 3:11AM on the 17th and I have no idea when we are leaving. We boarded around 8PM the 16th and deplaned ~10PM to a mostly empty airport. Around 11PM we were told we'd leave at 2:30AM, and at 2:15AM we were told the flight wouldn't be leaving. There has been very minimal Jetblue staff at the airport to answer questions. Those staff that were here had to deal with numerous frustrated customers. We were told to go to the Jetblue desk to change flights or get more information, and guess what? No one was there! In addition, there has been no food available in the airport since 10PM. Jetblue should have brought dinner food to the gate. Cheezits do not cut it. This has been a horrible experience, and I will do my best to never fly Jetblue again. As of now, they told us we'd be leaving around 4:30AM. But why should anyone trust that? There must be something you can do to get me back as a customer. How about a refund? I assume I will make it to my destination in the next 24 hours. The lack of staff and information (and food) has been dismal, and I know I am not the only one who feels this way. I see multiple families with children and I know they are very frustrated. How can Jetblue survive in the industry with service like this? I am clicking the box "I'm traveling within 48 hours" in hopes that I'll be at my destination by then (it's been over 12 hours in the Orlando airport, and 12 hours since I had any real food. Dismal service by Jetblue.

### "Don't use this airline"
Got to my destination with only an hour delay. My flight home was canceled after 3hrs and they wouldn't book me a returning flight until 2 days later (I was flying with a child to boot). I ended up spending extra money to fly home with another airline and got home a day late. My flight has not been refunded after significant amount of effort. They say it has, but no refund has ever been issued. They frequently put me on hold and leave me there until I hang up or tell me information that erroneous and different with each call. Don't use this airline, they will leave you stranded and broke.

### "Avoid Jetblue at all costs"
Not Verified |  Avoid Jetblue at all costs. I was traveling with a 2 year old. Before heading out to the airport found out the flight was going to be delayed by at least 3 hours which would get to my destination way past midnight. The only option available for help was to chat via text on WhatsApp. After waiting for half hour, requested the agent to switch the flight for the following day which would get to my destination at a decent hour. The option the agent offered for next day was to an airport 50 miles away from where I left with an arrival time 12:15 AM, past midnight. She just didn’t get it. So, with lot of trepidation decided to go to the airport to catch the original delayed flight. Get to the airport after traveling for 1.5 h, only to hear the announcement at the gate that flight has been canceled and rescheduled to following day. No act of god was involved for the delay. At the last minute scrambled to get a hotel, mind you this was an international trip (Jamaica). How is JetBlue even allowed to operate?

### "stranded me in South America"
Not Verified |  JetBlue stranded me in South America. Return midnight flight from Guayaquil, Ecuador to JFK, NY and plane never shows up. First email says flight is delayed until 3am, then next email at 5am says flight is cancelled due to bad weather. They offer no solutions to get out of the country except that they will inform you by email later what to do when they reschedule you. The weather excuse is bogus. They use weather as the excuse in order not to pay compensation. Do not believe the compensation rights email you get from them. I ended up having to book a flight at the airport with Copa Airlines that took me GYE-PTY-EWR (New Jersey), then bus to NYC because I had to work the next day. Although I use this airline frequently because of the routes and seat comfort, I am always tentative to do a return trip without a disruption, and their flight cancellations have been more frequent lately, stranding passengers all over the place. My son just got his domestic return flight to NY cancelled by Jetblue as well. They have a more serious issue that they are not disclosing.

### "not how you make a customer happy"
Not Verified | My husband and myself booked a vacation to celebrate my best friend's wedding in July. This was our first Jetblue flight so didn't think the worst. We got there without any issue but coming back was an overall stressful experience. Our 2pm flight was delayed since 8am that morning and kept on getting delayed. Because we needed to work the next day we needed to find another flight. Jetblue had nothing available within the earlier flight nor the later flight. We had to book a Delta ticket that was 3x the charge of Jetblue, which totalled $1,500 which had a 6 hour layover in Atlanta but it was the only way to get home prior to clocking in. Jetblue flight actually got delayed until 6am the next morning and we were happy that we thought to book another airline but now have to eat the additional cost. On top of that, they did not refund our plane ticket as promised and claim that they did. They said that there is nothing they can do about it and told me to check with the bank who also does not see anything pending. I am now $2,000 in the hole because of Jetblue and I only got a 400 airline credit. This is not how you make a customer happy. All I want is for them to make it right. I was even told the additional expenses that we needed for accrue as far as hotel and food in Atlanta would also not be covered.

### "No effort to improve its service"
Not Verified | Flight from Boston to Atlanta delay 3 hours in excellent weather, my previous fight to Tampa also be delayed for a couple hours. Unbelievable airline, always delay, delay. No effort to improve its service.

### "left me and my family stranded"
Jetblue left me and my family stranded on return trip from Atlanta to Bermuda. We knew we were going to miss connecting flight in NYC so we had to rebook in Bermuda. Due to a system error, they could not rebook our family of 3 and it was only our family they could not process. All other passengers were checking in their bags and proceeded through customs. We stood in front of check out counter from 11:15 to 8:15 while the jetblue agent was on the phone trying to fix the problem with a customer service agent. At 4:00 customs closed and we were stuck in Bermuda for another 4 hours just trying to have the agent book a flight out for whatever flight we could get. We kept missing opportunities to get on a flight because agent could not book due to their data base crash. Our family of 3 were separated and we all flew on different flights just to get back to Atlanta. JetBlue hesitated to put us up in Bermuda and then they said they had an agreement with a local resort who did not want to honor what jetblue said they approved. My card was charged over 1600 USD for a 2 night stay that I neither wanted not approved. Their was no concern on getting us home or following through with comping the stay. I assumed when I got back home the notes would show the nightmare that we experienced but the Bermudian agents did not put any notes and it just looked like we were just booked on the next available flight. This was 100% a jetblue error and now they are telling me that it is not covered. I am shocked, dismayed and not sure what to do. I understand delayed and cancelled flights as this happens all of the time but BEWARE as Jet Blue will lie and not honor their contract.

### "Delay after delay after delay"
Not Verified | Delay after delay after delay always the same thing with JetBlue. Jetblue will be my last choice whenever I travel. I’ve never had the problems I have with JetBlue with any other company’s. Only JetBlue. And the people I’m traveling with warmed me beforehand about JetBlue and I DIDNT LISTEN!

### "Significant rip off"
One way flight $750. Computer malfunctions led to late departure while on tarmac. All other flights coming and going. Limited refund or accommodation offered. No relationship with other airlines. Based upon ticket price (similar to delta, American etc) inconvenience and lack of resources similar to a no brand value airlines. Significant rip off. No Wi-Fi. Like watching TV from 70s with snow in background.

### "hope JetBlue wakes up someday"
Re: NYC to LAX, none stop, about 5 to 6 hours I am usually an easy going and patient traveler, I have encountered numerous problems when traveling, I never complained or reported it, but this is the worst experience. I booked a one way ticket with JetBlue Always from Newark to Los Angeles on 7/06/23, the travel date was 7/27/23, I checked in on 7/26/23. On the morning of 7/28/23, I received a cancellation notice from JetBlue (see attached Cancellation Notice). Problem 1. I was ok with the cancellation, anything could happen, I understood, as long as I could get a refund. About 30 minutes later, I received a rescheduled itinerary, JetBlue unilaterally set the departure at Westchester Airport which is 2 hours away from my home, the flight would take me to Orlando, the layover time would be 8 hours, then from Orlando to Los Angeles, the total travel time would be about 16 hours. Problem 2. It was still ok to me because JetBlue allowed me to cancel it for free. The instructions led me to "Manage trip". I followed the instructions but kept receiving error messages, so the refund couldn't be processed. Problem 3. It suggested "Chat" would be the fastest way to solve the problems/issues, or for Q&A. But "Chat" couldn't solve my problem, it led me back to "Manage trip" again and again, and couldn't do anything for me. Problem 4. I had no choice but to call JetBlue, the holding time to reach a live person was 1.5 hours, finally a real person picked up my line, the first sentence was to let me know that the refund request placed on the phone was subject to $25. Well, I started to get aggravated. Anyway, the refund request was sent in and the $25 fee was waived. Problem 5. Finally I received the refund with $30 short. The interesting part was the refund amount on the statement was correct, but the actual amount was $30 less (see attached). So I had to call Jetblue again, the representative told me after investigation it was their mistake when processing the refund. Well, JetBlue used to be my favorite airline, I don't know why it changed so much in a bad way, I believe I am not the only one having these problems. I am sharing this experience with the public, hope JetBlue wakes up someday, and improves the quality of service.

### "Stay away from JetBlue"
The worst flight experience I have had on any airline. The forward flight was canceled two hours before the scheduled departure due to the JetBlue mess, and no help was provided by JetBlue other than a refund and ticket for the next day, 24H later. I had to buy four one-way tickets and pay 4x more: still waiting for compensation from JetBlue. My family spend four hours extra at LAX and $1000 for four one-hour flights. Stay away from JetBlue.

### "still have not received refund"
JetBlue cancelled my flight due to weather/air traffic control and did not cover all the added costs for our family to extend our trip and book a new flight. JetBlue's next available flight was 4 days later. It rained for 10 minutes that day and they just don't have the resources to accommodate the delays or cancellations coming from other parts of the country. It has been more than 10 business days and still have not received refund and incurred additional costs at $843 above what credit they are giving back. Wait times when trying to call the airline were 5 hours. Will not fly with them again.

### "cancelled and delayed frequently"
Not Verified | No good experiences. Flight gets cancelled and delayed frequently. My 8:16 flight rescheduled for 9:21 then to 10:25. No idea when it actually going to fly or cancelled for the day.

### "never again will I be using Jetblue"
Not Verified | Our flight was delayed which made me miss the next flight after which was ridiculous. I had to wait 8 hours for the next flight only for it to take me to Queen's and then to my destination instead of straight there which would only had been an hour but now it will be 3. So that's about 10-11 hours it took to get home in which stressed me out so much, especially since I'm pregnant, and they only gave me a voucher for $12 in food which did nothing since everything here cost more that ten? It was an ridiculous experience, and never again will I be using Jetblue. They seem very unorganized. Not the first flight I've seen to miss their next flight either. I am very stressed out and tired. They even changed the number without notice, so many people are missing their flights it's disgusting.

### "Canceled my flight 5 hours before departure"
Worst airline. Canceled my flight 5 hours before departure. Told me they could get me on a flight 3 days later. Would not help me with a hotel room. Told me the refund would take 10 days. They just left me stranded nowhere to sleep nothing to eat, and no money back for 10 days.

### "Still waiting for bags"
Not Verified |  Terrible. Scheduled to leave at noon. Left at 1:30. Held in San Juan till 3:40. Still waiting for bags in Boston at 9:30. Negligible explanations or apologies. Dreadful.

### "customers pay ridiculous prices"
Not Verified |  Flight delay, very rough landing, ran out of most food (even items available for purchase), no Wifi, no in-flight entertainment. When I contacted customer service (at a flight attendant's urging) I was told that I should just bring my own snacks and download a movie before I fly. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful, but seemed embarrassed by the conditions on the plane. To sum up, on JetBlue, customers pay ridiculous prices and are then asked to bring their own food, bring their own entertainment, pay extra for traveling with carry-on luggage, pay extra for the privilege of sitting with their family members, and then have to deal with snarky customer service reps. I know JetBlue doesn't need my business, but they don't have to flaunt it.

### "nothing short of a nightmare"
My recent encounter with JetBlue Airways was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, this trip was plagued with delays, cancellations, and an utter lack of care for their customers. It all began with a 2-hour delay on our flight from JFC airport to San Jose. Although delays can happen, the lack of communication and transparency from JetBlue's staff made the situation incredibly frustrating and stressful for all passengers involved. The real ordeal began on our return flight from San Jose to JFK airport, which JetBlue unceremoniously canceled without any prior warning. The alternative they offered was to reschedule us on a flight departing from San Francisco airport, which is about a 1-hour drive away from our intended destination! It's hard to fathom how an airline can think it's acceptable to make such a drastic change without taking into account the inconvenience it causes passengers. To add insult to injury, JetBlue's lack of responsibility and concern for their customers became evident when they refused to provide any compensation for the additional expenses incurred due to their own incompetence. They did not offer any hotel accommodations for the unexpected overnight stay in San Francisco, forcing us to bear the cost ourselves. Additionally, they showed no willingness to arrange for transportation to the San Francisco airport, leaving us stranded and helpless. As if the frustration wasn't enough, their customer service was an absolute disaster. Attempting to contact them by phone was an exercise in futility, as the waiting time to speak to a representative was a staggering 1 hour! Similarly, the wait time for their chat support was an outrageous 1 hour and 30 minutes! It's evident that JetBlue lacks the capacity or desire to address the grievances of their customers promptly. Throughout this entire ordeal, the staff's attitude displayed a disheartening lack of empathy and understanding. It felt as if they considered us mere inconveniences rather than valued patrons who deserved respect and consideration. In conclusion, my experience with JetBlue Airlines was beyond disappointing. The delays, cancellations, and subsequent lack of support and compensation have left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I strongly advise against choosing JetBlue for your travel needs unless you're willing to endure a series of unfortunate events and an indifferent customer service team. There are plenty of other airlines that prioritize their passengers and go the extra mile to ensure a smooth and pleasant journey. JetBlue has shown a complete disregard for their customers' well-being, and I will certainly not be entrusting them with my business in the future.

### "the worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Horrible customer service. No compensation for flight both delayed over 5 hours! Representative gave so many excuses until the denied any sort of compensation for a family of four with small children stranded in the airport. Inflight was also terrible no service of any sort tv service not working. We travel a lot and this was the worst experience ever. Never again!

### "flight time has changed 10 times"
Do not ever ever ever EVER EVER EVER fly Jet Blue unless you’re into masochism or just don’t want to ever go back home. This is my 3rd time flying with Jet Blue and this is the 3rd time I’ve experience incompetence with them. Our flight is delayed because of some mysterious storm that I can’t seem to find anywhere on the radar. We were supposed to fly out 9PM last night and it’s currently 12:41 PM 7/22/23. The flight time has changed around 10 times now and was just delayed again to 1:30PM today. I TOLD my boyfriend not to fly with them again, but No. The last time we flew with them, the pilot never even showed up for work and they had to bring a pilot from another airport. Now this flight has been delayed “due to weather” (which is all they can say) and late last night they changed the time to 3 AM from 12:30 PM. If this is due to weather, how can you just push the time up roughly 9 hours? And then push it to 1:30 pm, and then 12:30 and then 1:30 again? This is by far the worst airline in the world and they have THE NERVE to try to buy another airline. Get your business in order first before you try ruining Spirit Airlines (which I assume HAS to be 500x better than this trash airline). At least this time it wasn’t 10 degrees on the flight, though the Wi-Fi didn’t work. There were no apologies or anything. Also, every flight from every other airline that was heading to New York from San Francisco (which is very close to San Jose, you can see that airport when you’re taking off) that night we’re all fly out on time, no delays or anything. There was no bad weather or anything. Just JetBlue lying to keep from having to give refunds or something to everybody.

### "very bad customer service"
Not Verified | Very bad experience with airline staff. They are not taking care of customers. Unprofessional staff. Asking for help many times with their employees, none of them are helping. They are not even listening. They are talking on phone and talk to another staff making jokes each other, very bad customer service

### "I will never book JetBlue again"
Third time flying to Boston from Tampa this year for healthcare reasons for my dad. I have flown Jet Blue since 2005. I loved them for years and probably have seventy five flights with them. I will never book JetBlue again. The last few trips have been maintenance problems with the plane. My trip on July 23rd to Tampa is delayed from 10:18 to 2:40 as they are waiting for a plane from the Dominican republic to arrive. A four hour delay is now common on Jet Blue flights along with cancelations. The email they sent me says it is a 22hr flight to Tampa and the help desk doesn't know why it says that so you have to literally go to the help desk to get information. I am sixty years old and have flown my whole life. They have turned into the worst airline in the United States.

### "The customer service is horrible"
Not Verified |  Jetblue doesn't cancel flights they push them back and make you waste time and money at the airport to then cancel flights. If there's a safety issue it's better to cancel a flight. I was leaving Saturday evening and my plane never left so I tried a different day and the flight was delayed again. I tried a new flight and it's delayed as well. There should be a policy that if a flight is delayed for than three times that it should be canceled. The customer service is horrible in the Santo Domingo airport in Jetblue. You can wait on a line for an hour or more and they don't help anyone or communicate what's happening to the plane. The Jetblue workers in Santo Domingo have attitudes and don't wanna do their job. Jetblue will delay everything and not compensate you when you lose days of work. Jetblue only wants money and they don't provide the service that they say online.

### "will think twice before booking"
Not Verified | I was scheduled on a flight that was Jet Blue cancelled. With that knowledge I booked with another airline for the next day. After my booking I received and email from Jetblue that I was booked on another flight the next day. There was no mention of this in the email cancelling my flight. Now its to late to get a refund. In all my years I have never had this happen. Be very careful with dealing with this airline. I will certainly think twice before booking with them in the future!

### "little to no communication"
Complete shaft on an expensive family vacation! JetBlue did not have an aircraft at the gate for a 9:41 flight to Punta Cana. However they knew the feeder flight was going to be 5 hours late. Substituted a plane for a boarding time at 1:15pm. Kept us on plane for 2 hours while they scrambled for available pilots. Still on plane at 5:38 pm with little to no communication. Finally let passengers get off the plane to be berated by counter staff! I have flown JetBlue many times but this will be my last! Understaffed!

### "we are stranded in another state"
Before our flight, we saw in the news that over 1,500 other JetBlue flights were canceled. Still went to our flight (because we had no other choice), waiting 4 hours from 8 in the evening to midnight, only to have police come over to tell us our flight was canceled. Turns out, it wasn't just ours; on the board of flights, over 15 other flights were heavily delayed and canceled. We were all told at once about the cancelation, so we all ran against one another to get in line first, which has barely moved as I write this (over an hour wait now). There was an automatic rebooking, which would take us up to New York (which is being hit by heavy storms), then back down to Florida, then finally to California which makes 0 sense. Employees have said all their hotels are booked and no direct flights can come until 2 days, so overall we are stranded in another state with nothing and no compensation. Way to go JetBlue, never flying here again and neither should you.

### "Delayed with no explanation"
Delayed flight for over three hours with no explanation. Once on board the flight attendant or the pilot told us the repair of a broken flight attendant seat took longer than expected. All of this after trying to find another flight after canceling my flight after midnight. I happened to look at my phone for the time at 12:15 and saw they cancelled the flight. I spent the next six hours waiting for a human being to book us on a flight from a different airport. Beyond disgusted with the lack of care shown by the airline and the employees. Very little done to convince me to fly with them again. No longer do they go the extra mile. The app is useless. The website is useless. Oops try again. We are unable to complete your request at this time.” The return flight is now scheduled for 12:42 AM and totally doesn’t sync with connecting flight in Boston. Their attitude is “Oh well.” I totally feel unwanted by this airline. Not that anyone from Jetblue would read this. They are flailing and failing. I’d rate them a ZERO if I could.

### "leather seats well worn"
Not Verified | Just returned today on trip from Boston to Asheville, flight delayed Approx. 3 hours. On trip to Boston was delayed about 6 hours. Worse trip ever. Plane was old, faux leather seats well worn. Plane was dirty, food under seats. Weather was supposed to have problem on Friday, no reason today. Pilot gave virtually nil flight information. Flight attendant making announcements could not be understood, talk too low and fast. The plane noise was terrible, seats popped and cracked. Never again.

### "This is simply a money grab"
Not Verified |  1) We flew MIA to Newark and they didn't put our 2 children's car seats on the flight. Both tagged and handed over with the luggage. They were not able to get them to us. Our children are 3 and 4 and the customer service response is "your problem" 2) Flight from NYC to MIA on Friday is canceled. Jetblue provided no information and I mean none at all. Unaware if they are rebooking or refunding. Call wait times are long. 3) They can't reebok from New York Airport. They can get us on a flight from DC to Fort Lauderdale, so we get to DC. They cancel that flight and rebook us from DC going to West Palm. Even though they are still selling flights from DC to FLL and had enough space to book all 4 of us for any of the FLL flights. We find this out as we arrive to the airport. We were notified via voice message 4hrs later. After 2hrs wait to speak to an agent we were told they "can send us to any South Florida airport they want" and other passengers (even those without tickets previously) have priority. This is simply a money grab so they can continue selling flights and fill up the low demand flights to other locations. Arriving into West Palm, 70+ miles from our airport, at 9pm, with 2 small children after 72hrs of traveling is acceptable to Jetblue and a true representation of how little they value their customers. We have submitted a refund and rebooked with American, and will never make the mistake of booking Jetblue again their processes are not customer centric.

### "Do not fly JetBlue"
Do not fly JetBlue. They will absolutely screw you over and you will spend 10 hours of your time trying to talk to someone while stranded without any helpful information. We lost a lot of money. Will likely not fly again.

### "worst I've ever encountered"
This airline is undoubtedly the worst I've ever encountered. Prepare yourself for a mind-boggling level of disorganization and sheer incompetence. They take delay torment to a whole new level, making you suffer through agonizing 6-hour delays with zero explanation. And as if that's not enough, they have the audacity to charge you a ridiculous $25 fee just to attempt to reach their so-called customer service phone line, only to have them hang up on you without a care in the world. Picture this: you're already subjected to a mind-numbing 6-hour delay, and on top of that, they have the gall to demand $25 from you for the privilege of contacting them.

### "spent in hours of disarray"
Not Verified | Our honeymoon was spent in hours of disarray! The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life. Our flight was delayed, and we missed our connecting flight. As if that wasn’t stressful enough. I was laughed at, told to get over it, and the “supervisor” spoke as though she was in high school. Making rude faces, throwing her hands up saying not my problem, and doing absolutely zero to make the situation better. I will NEVER fly jet blue again. I had a man yell at me to look at his hand as he’s giving me directions, and I was looking at his hand and where he was pointing. I’m honestly not even upset about my flight. The lack of communication, and level of unprofessional behavior from every single member of that team on July 14th 2023. Solidified my feelings that I would rather never fly again, then fly JetBlue.

### "incompetence laughably pathetic"
JetBlue’s operational incompetence is laughably (not really funny) pathetic. After a 2 hour delay (the 4th multi hour delay I have had this month on this airline), at the designated boarding time, the gate attendant informs us that “our plan had to be diverted to Charlotte because of storms.” Setting aside whether or not the stated reason is true, why would it take until boarding time for JetBlue to reveal that the plane is in another city. Zero authenticity. Zero trustworthiness. This airline is operationally incompetent. Take this airline if you relish getting massively delayed every time you fly and enjoy getting jerked around about how long the delay will be.

### "waited for baggage for an hour in a half"
Went to South Carolina for my brothers marine graduation with my family along with my 3 children under the age of 5 After multiple flight delays they canceled the flight. The following day we took our flight to LGA sitting on the plane for 2 hours because again it was delayed. We waited for our baggage for an hour in a half Forgot our pack n play and high chair. A week later we got a call that we left it behind to go pick it up. I called back to tell them the day before & told them I’m going to pick it up lady saw it and said no problem. The rude lady (in charge of baggage claim JetBlue LGA) told us it was discarded after I had spoke to someone and it was confirmed. The person I spoke to the day before confirmed seeing my pack n play along with the seater even told me the color it was. Told her I would be there at 10 in the morning the following day which was July 14 We leave 1:30 mins away I got there 9:40AM staff was nowhere to be found, and the people working there were very nice and told us it was still in a building. Unfortunately the person in charge of baggage was not nice & threw away my daughters travel Pack n play and Eating seater.

### "JetBlue is turning into Spirit Airlines"
Not Verified |  I see JetBlue is turning into Spirit Airlines. I purchased a ticket that's cost met $187 that turned into travel credits after I canceled my trip. Now I am trying to rebook my trip but I am told I only can use my credit for the ticket and not for the extra bag or seat, while I still have extra credit balance available. They won't return my money to my credit card and they won't allow me to use it to pay my extra luggage. This sounds like cheap low level type of service just as Spirit Airlines. Instead of correcting or becoming better I can see a duplicate of a spirit airlines.

### "unprofessional attitude and rude behavior"
Very unprofessional. Flight was cancelled with out information The service person was rude and unprofessional. Gave food voucher but not happy with the unprofessional attitude and rude behavior

### "never travel with JetBlue again"
Thanks to Jet Blue for the worst travel experience my family and I have ever had. Our flight was supposed to be about 2 1/2 hours from Seattle to LAX. After arriving at our gate we learned that our flight had been delayed by 2 hours. Ok, no big deal. Then another 2 hours, and then again and again. Our flight was delayed for more than 10 hours. After speaking to the gate agent 2 different times, we, and everyone else were told the plane had a mechanical issue and would arrive asap. Everyone was also told they would be issued a $200 credit for the delay per Jet Blue policy. The gate agent said we would receive an email regarding this credit. Nobody was happy about the delay, but at least we would be compensated, or so we thought. After several days without an email about the credit we were promised I called Jet Blue customer service. I was told that we were not entitled to any compensation because our 10 hour delay was weather related. How convenient. Their compensation policy doesn't cover weather delays. I already knew weather delays weren't covered after reading their policy during our delay. I asked where the plane was coming from and they said LAX. What weather delays does LAX have in July? I explained to them that a result of this delay my family lost an entire day of our vacation and lost our car rental since we arrived after hours. Why do Jet Blue gate agents tell us all it was a mechanical issue with the plane (covered under their compensation policy) and promise everyone compensation, then Jet Blue doesn't follow through? Sounds like a bait and switch. Customer service offered us a $75 credit to each of us as a "courtesy". I declined the credit because this isn't about a dollar amount for me. This is about a company following through with what it promises its customers. After sharing this story with a friend, they explained that they had a similar experience with Jet Blue. Maybe its Jet Blues policy to lie to its customers. As a result of this, my family will never travel with JetBlue again. I would rather pay more to fly with a different airline than to give them our business again.

### "unprofessional and disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  5pm flight was cancelled at 9:45pm. A JetBlue representative online said we would get hotel vouchers as the next available flight was 48 hours later. When we asked for compensation for our hotel, JetBlue stated it wasn’t their responsibility since the delay was weather related. Very unprofessional and disappointing experience overall.

### "misguided by the JetBlue agent"
I bought a JetBlue return ticket with 50 lbs of check-in baggage to travel from Atlanta and Boston from June 05 to June 10, 2023. I faced three main problems: 1) After a few days of booking, I was informed by JetBlue that my direct flight had been canceled. They also assigned me a new flight which was several hours earlier than my actual departure time from Boston. I contacted the JetBlue helpline and requested to book another flight (the only option for June 10), which wasn’t direct (rather Boston to Florida to Atlanta). 2) During the online boarding process on June 05 and 10, I had to choose a check-in baggage option and was informed that my credit card would not be charged if I had already paid for check-in baggage. I followed the same process on my return flight from Boston to Atlanta. But my credit card was charged $35 for my Atlanta to Boston trip. After a few days, when I looked at my credit card summary, I contacted JetBlue for a refund. They said they would process my request in the next ten days. But contacting JetBlue support was a very frustrating process: wait time was 45 minutes, and it took me over an hour to report the matter to a JetBlue crewmember. 3) The most important and frustrating thing I experienced on June 10 when returning from Boston to Atlanta. The good thing was that JetBlue informed me that I must leave early for the airport because there was some construction work going on in Boston City; therefore, commuting to Boston airport may take longer than usual. My flight was scheduled for 3:45 PM. Therefore, I left for the airport at 12:00 PM. But when I reached the airport, I learned that the departure was delayed for around 35 minutes. The flight kept on delaying, and finally, I learned that I would not be able to catch my 2nd JetBlue flight from Florida to Atlanta if I flew by the original flight from Boston to Florida. I approached the JetBlue helpdesk at Boston Airport. After more than 90 minutes of waiting, I talked to the help desk official. He issued me a new direct ticket (Boston to Atlanta) for the next day. Upon asking, they informed me that I could book a hotel for up to $250. I booked a hotel for an overnight stay in Boston and spent around $240 (I didn’t eat dinner). Then I contacted JetBlue and sent them the invoice. After ten days, I was informed by JetBlue that I was not eligible for reimbursement because the flight was delayed due to the weather. Why was I misguided by the JetBlue agent that I was entitled to a $250 hotel? As a graduate student, $250 is a huge amount for me.

### "I’m extremely disappointed"
I had a flight to go back to Atlanta from NYC on July 9th, but they canceled it. I tried to contact them because in the website it says they provide food voucher and hotel in case of cancellation due to controllable reason but they said the cancellation happened because of the weather, so there was nothing they could do besides rescheduling my flight. The next available flight was 2 days later, so I had to find somewhere to stay on short notice, spend a money that I couldn’t (my hotel reservations for the previous days were a gift). Also, my husband and I missed 2 days of work, and we won’t get paid for these days. I had to pay someone to petsit my cat since I had paid her only for the amount of days I thought we would need. The customer service was ridiculous, he seemed so used to dealing with this situation that he seemed to not care at all. I’m extremely disappointed at the company and definitely not using their services ever again.

### "They are now horrific"
My last several flights were very late. In July 22 I was bumped and now exactly a year later they cancelled my July 9 flight two hours before takeoff when I had already paid $150 for a car service. They said they’d email a new flight. They didn’t. They removed the flight from my app so I couldn’t manage it. I finally got on a new flight on July 12 (3 days later) after spending literally 4 hours trying to reschedule and losing money for a hotel and time share points. In addition I had to pay a car service to get home. Then they sent an email saying the cancellation was out of their control and they didn’t have to reimburse any of my expenses. Friends told me not to use them. I used to love them. They are now horrific and do not care about their customers. Most working people save all year to go on vacation. We have limited vacation time and money. Shame on you JetBlue!

### "I will never fly JetBlue again"
Not Verified |  I flew round trip Reno to Los Angeles, first flight delayed, was supposed to leave at 7:00 PM got delayed until 12:45 AM and didn’t get to our hotel until 3 AM. On the way back to Reno was delayed again, was supposed to leave at 4:35 and currently waiting to leave current board time is 8:00 but we’ll see if that even happens. I will never fly JetBlue again. A nightmare every time I fly with them.

### "Absolutely terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible experience and finger pointing travel experience. Flight was booked through SATA airline with JetBlue providing domestic flights. First it was ridiculous to fly Tampa International Airport to Boston Logan then to JFK with Jet Blue; then SATA from JFK to Azores Ponta Delgada. Jet Blue cancelled flight to JFK at last hour. We even flew directly over JFK enroute to Boston Logan. Jet Blue’s agents were inconsiderate and not customer friendly or helpful service. They rebooked our flight for a day later with entirely different airline flying to Madrid then back to Azores a day late. This cut the time in Azores plus defeated the purpose of stopping in Azores for a shorter trip to Europe. Will never again Fly with JetBlue or recommend them to anyone. Another thing before taking off from Tampa the restrooms in the plane were nasty. I guess it just shows how poor an airline Jet Blue is based on my experience. To address finger pointing they blame the cancellation on weather. It wasn’t even raining or bad weather. We flew directly over JFK to Boston.

### "My flight was great"
Not Verified |  I recently flew on Jetblue from Florida to Providence and due to a glitch in reservations I had no flight booked just before check in the day before. I called Jetblue and they immediately fixed the problem and made sure I flew back home on June 22nd. The customer service rep was so concerned for me she got her supervisor online to help out. My flight was great. I used to be a 20 plus year Southwest Airlines frequent flyer, but due to the cancellation of direct flights from Providence RI to FT Lauderdale Florida I ditched them and have now been a loyal member of Jetblue for the last 2 years. As a frequent flyer of 12 flights per year I also have had a few delays, but were very far inbetween. I noticed that most of the complaints came from casual or vacation planers who are already under an incredible amount of anxiety and stress that comes along with travel. One of the best things for me about Jetblue is the InFlight entertainment that is in each seat rest. Otherwise the flight would be very boring.The snacks and drink selection is always great and the flight attendants are always helpful with whatever you need. As you read reviews that are negative please take into account these people are not regular travelers and expect everything to be perfect in this very time consuming and messed up world we all live in.

### "Absolute worst airline experience"
Absolute worst airline experience I've ever had. Our flight was delayed 5 hours. We were told it was because the incoming flight from Las Vegas was delayed. When our plane arrived at LAX JetBlue used that plane to accommodate another flight that was on time. Since our flight was delayed they pushed us back hour after hour with no help or announcements from customer service. Anytime we asked for help we were told there's nothing they can do and they had no idea when we would take off. We still haven't even boarded or been updated in hours so we're at a 5 hour delay and counting. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional. I was told this was a good airline to fly yet every other airline I've ever flown has treated their customers far better then this.

### "experiences left much to be desired"
Not Verified |  I recently had the opportunity to fly with JetBlue airlines on two separate occasions, and my experiences left much to be desired. While I appreciate that delays can happen, the level of inconvenience I faced on both my outbound and return flights was simply unacceptable. During my initial journey, my flight was delayed for four hours, causing significant disruption to my travel plans. This unexpected delay left me frustrated and feeling as though my time was not valued by the airline. I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, but the lack of clear communication and assistance from the JetBlue staff compounded my disappointment. However, my dissatisfaction reached new heights when my return flight was delayed for five hours. The reason provided for this prolonged delay was particularly disheartening: the pilot was allegedly stuck in traffic. It is perplexing to think that such a vital member of the flight crew would not have contingencies in place to avoid traffic-related mishaps. This incident gave rise to concerns about the airline's organizational preparedness and overall professionalism. While I acknowledge that flight delays can occur across the industry, the recurrence of such extensive delays with JetBlue has left a lasting impression. The overall lack of transparency and efficiency in handling these situations left me questioning the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction. I must mention, however, that once the flights finally took off, the onboard experience was pleasant. The flight attendants were courteous and attentive, and the in-flight amenities provided a comfortable journey. However, these positive aspects were overshadowed by the significant inconveniences and frustrations I encountered at the start of both trips. In conclusion, my experiences with JetBlue airlines left me disappointed and hesitant to choose their services in the future. While the onboard experience was commendable, the recurring and excessively long delays I faced at the beginning of my trips, including a delay of five hours due to a pilot stuck in traffic, greatly overshadowed any positive aspects. I hope JetBlue takes this feedback constructively and focuses on improving their operational efficiency to ensure a more reliable and customer-centric service in the future.

### "My return was the real nightmare"
Not Verified |  Do not fly Jet Blue! My flight from PBI to JFK on June 20th was 4 hours late. My return was the real nightmare. I was scheduled to return on June 28th. I received an email on the night of the 27th that the flight was canceled. Jet Blue rescheduled me in the same flight on July 2nd. Four days later. They canceled that flight and rescheduled me on July 3rd from White Plains at 9PM, 30 miles away. I opted to get the refund and scheduled a flight on Delta for $480. The Delta flight left on time and arrived 20 minutes early. The flight from White Plains was delayed and I’m not sure if they canceled that as well. I am a frequent traveler and have never experienced a 5 day delay. That is unacceptable. I understand there were thunderstorms but even hurricanes in Florida don’t result in 5 day delays. Fortunately I have family in NYC, my sympathies go out to families that were forced to pay for hotels and meals and missed graduations, weddings, funerals and travel connections. I’ll never fly Jet Blue again.

### "never fly with JetBlue ever again"
My husband, my daughter and I were scheduled to travel with Jetblue from LAX to New York JFK on June 25, 2023 at 5:45 am with arrival at 2:20 pm. We were scheduled to fly out of new York JFK with Norse Atlantic at 6:20 pm to London Gatwick. We received an automated call at 12 am on June 25th along with an email that our JetBlue flight was canceled. The recording stated that we would be flying at 11:57 pm from Ontario to JFK with arrival at 8:20am on June 26, 2023 . That meant that we would miss our flight to London. We got on the phone, waited a half hour to be connected to a jetblue agent in Rwanda who after 45 minutes of researching told us that the best she could do is to refund our money, as she was unable to offer any other solutions. we asked to speak to a manager. we waited for 2 hours before giving up and accepting a refund. We had to rebook our entire vacation and connecting flights and hotel in Europe in 3 hours. It cost us extra 2500 usd to change our vacation. Later this week I found that the reason for cancellation was Crew legality which means they were short on pilots! Who did their scheduling? I will never fly with JetBlue ever again. Stay away from JetBlue. They will surely screw you.

### "they lost this customer"
Not Verified | My Review is about Jet Blues administrative policy's. I spent hours picking out the right flight that met my needs for our vacation. A few weeks after booking Jet Blue cancels my flight and assigns me another flight. This new flight the picked for me was awful I would miss a whole days vacation because my original flight landed at 10AM and new Flight landed at 11:15 PM to my destination. My return flight switched from getting me home on a Sunday to a redeye arriving home on a Monday. Just didn't fit my needs and obviously a cheaper flight than I had booked. JetBlue allows you one change however they had NO FLIGHTS nonstop going to and from my destination. I called an agent to try and work things out however things went from bad to worst. They would refund my money but they would only put the money in a JetBlue bank that I could use one for one year. I didn't think this was fair since they made the change and now I was stuck trying to make jet blue work for me. I didn't want to leave money in a bank that I had to use within a year this was my money and they made the change not me. I had to rebook on different days and no longer was there a non stop option they all had at least one stop and a 6 hour trip each way turned into a 10 plus hour trip. Just what I was trying to avoid. I feel like Jet Blue is a bunch of thieves stealing my money and then charging me more money for an inferior flight. Spoke with supervisor and really worthless got the standard line of this is our policy. Whatever happened to treat the customer with respect and make them happy. Not so in this Airlines. I have been a loyal customer for years but lately (last three trips) things have been going wrong and this is the third time my flights were cancelled after taking so much time to plan. Jet Blue needs a new business plan because they lost this customer.

### "Totally unorganized company"
Totally unorganized company. On our first flight from Orlando to Santo Domingo we waited 45 min at the gate because of mechanical issues. Then we boarded the flight only to be removed 30 min later. Gates were switched and boarded again a couple hours later. Then we waited on plane because they needed another crew to fly back since current pilots reached their limit. Another hour and a half later, they found another crew. We taxied to the runway then pilot says there’s a service light that came on. 10 min later that was resolved. Then they said their flight schedule was deleted and they had to wait another 30 min. I’m surprised we arrived to our destination that day. After we made it, we waited on our luggage over an hour before they got it to baggage claim. Now our trip back to Orlando ran an hour and a half late getting out of the gate including another gate change. We’ve landed in Orlando and now they don’t have a gate for us to pull into. Shame on this company, I’ll avoid them all together.

### "offered no compensation whatsoever for our troubles"
Not Verified |  Initial flight status was showing on time. However then delays started to come in. They announced over the intercom they lost our plane! How on earth do you lose a plane? They had to find us another plane. Went to another gate and eventually boarded that plane. Plane air conditioning was not working, the attendants told us that up front. Got on the runway and we got stopped due to weather. Sat on the runway for over an hour then went back to the gate and deplaned. Sat through many more delays and eventually got on plane again. Sat almost an hour before leaving the gate. Got on the runway and sat there for another hour. Still couldn't take off so took us back to the gate once again! Got off and we wanted to just cancel the flight. Would not let us until it was officially cancelled by them. Had to wait through more delays and eventually got cancelled late that night. Had to wait in a very long line to get tickets cancelled and refunded. There were no flights out the next 2 days at least. Note I still don't have my refund as of this review, said it takes 7-10 days. They offered no compensation whatsoever for our troubles. I know you can't control weather delays but the experience and customer service is something you can control. We had to get a rental car and drive from Boston to Charlotte to get home! Worst flying experience I ever had!

### "We will never use Jet Blue again"
Our flight was cancelled a few hours before takeoff and we were informed it was due to flight mechanical issues and that we should receive compensation for our flight not being rebooked until 2 days later and that we would receive an email within 7 days with compensation. It took a while day to rebook everything for our trip, including 2.5 hours on the phone with jet blue. After speaking to the representative today, (9 days later and still no email) she said we were not getting compensation, but will not give the full reason why. This cancellation not only interrupted our full trip, but incurred late cancellation fees to correct. Since the reason for the cancellation was not a Forced Majeure Event, we should be allowed compensation. It is unacceptable. Our return flight was delayed twice as well. No reason given. We were pushed to the last row of the plane (since it was rebooked due to the original cancellation and we didn't get seats until we arrived) where the stewards were very loudly banging several times throughout the flight startling me and waking up the screaming infant after she finally fell asleep (several times). This was the worst experience I have ever had and we fly regularly. We will never use Jet Blue again.

### "got delayed 12 hours"
Not Verified |  The worst ever, bought a flight and got delayed 12 hours, going back the same thing almost 10 hours. When i was in Newark they said they where late because of weather condition in Florida, now I'm in Florida and they are delay because of the weather in Newark. Then they tell you that airline traffic department wont allow them to land but they will need to cancel because now they don't have an airplane, when people decides to cancel their trip 1-2 hours later they get an airplane, I think they overbook or they put 2 flights into one.

### "lying when they said we could get a refund"
Not Verified |  On April 17, 2023, I was scheduled on a jetblue flight from Fort Lauderdale to Hartford. About an hour before the approximately 7:00 flight, they announced a delay. They updated it with a further delay until 10:10. Around 9:30 they announced the flight was cancelled. Of course, everyone rushed to the jetblue ticket counter. It was chaos. They began announcing and continued to repeat the announcement that they could not get anyone on a flight to the northeast until Friday (this was Monday). They repeatedly announced that if you wanted to reschedule (not before Friday), you should wait in line at the ticket counter. If you wanted a REFUND, don't wait in line and call jetblue. I chose the latter. A few days later, I phoned jetblue. The agent said there would be no refund, but as a courtesy he would give me a travel credit. I recently checked the travel credits and it's not there. I contacted jetblue. The agent said she has no record of the credit and, anyway, there is no credit for flights canceled due to weather. So, the agents making the announcement at the FLL airport were lying when they said we could get a refund. The agent who said he would give me a travel credit lied too.

### "was terrible experience"
My flight canceled 4 times today, after 9 hours, we get in the plane. We’ve waited another 2 hours in the plane due to heavy traffic, then the pilot has announced the plane has so much fuel and they got us off the plane. After we left the plane, they said the flight canceled because there are no crew to flight. I couldn’t believe what I heard. My first time and the last time flying with this airplane. The other passengers said it happens all the time. İt was terrible experience. Stay away from this airplane

### "later deny us a refund"
My wife and I arrived at the airport 90 minutes in advance, and the flight was delayed 30 minutes, so we ended up 2 hours early. The lines for baggage drop-off were out the door. We used a JetBlue kiosk to purchase two bag tags to check two of our bags; it charged us for two but only printed out one. We were told by a JetBlue employee to go to the kiosk help desk line to address the issue: there were two snaking lines of maybe 20-30 people each, manned by just two employees, and they were moving at the rate of one customer every 10-15 minutes. Were we to wait in that line, we almost certainly were going to miss our flight. So, we elected to use a second kiosk to purchase a bag tag for our second bag in the hopes this one would work; it didn't, but it took our money (again). So, rather than jump from kiosk to kiosk, paying more and more money in the hope that one would work, which is unreasonable, we were forced to wait in line. By the time we reached the front, the JetBlue employee told us that we were going to miss our flight and that, in addition, the flight was "overbooked," so they were going to have to "rebook" or "cancel. She searched for other flights that day, including through JetBlue, its partner American Airlines, and non-partner airlines; the earliest available flight was July 1. It was the morning of June 28, we had just moved out of our apartment and shipped our stuff to LA, and we were scheduled to move into our new LA apartment that same day, so we would have had to pay for food and lodging for the interval period in Boston--a hefty price--rather than stay in our new paid-for apartment in LA. We explained this to the JetBlue employee, who said that she would cancel our flight and issue a refund for our tickets and bags. I requested confirmation that this would be to our original payment method; she confirmed it would be. There was only one more flight in the entire Boston region that had capacity to take us to LA before July 1: a flight leaving in two hours out of Providence. My wife and I booked the flight, quickly compared taxi and rideshare prices, discovered the difference was negligible, and took an Uber to the airport in Providence, where we successfully boarded the last flight to LA. We later discovered that we had been deceived by the JetBlue employee at the kiosk help desk in Boston; she did NOT issue any refund and instead wrote in her "notes" that my wife and I were "late" to check in our bags, which was a complete lie and clearly intended to create a fabricated, falsified paper trail to later deny us a refund. We could not check in our bags because JETBLUE'S kiosks were defective, but that didn't matter to JetBlue's customer "service" representatives. The fact that we were told the flight was overbooked even though it apparently wasn't didn't matter to JetBlue's customer "service" representatives. We had to fight for hours over the phone to even get our bags refunded; we're still on the hook for the tickets according to JetBlue's "policy.

### "spend the little extra $$ and fly Delta"
We had a 7am flight out of SLC to Orlando. Upon waking up at 4am to get to the airport we had received an email after midnight saying our flight was cancelled. There was no reason provided. There is no phone number to get help. Just hey click here for a refund or reschedule, no ability to reschedule to next day and it was a 13 hour flight. We were flying non-stop, the $$$ we have put into this trip so we quickly looked for other airlines. Everything is booked or outrageous prices do to last minute booking. So disappointed, my daughter needs to be in Florida to visit a college so we will make the trip, but is now costing us a whole lot more. So my advice, spend the little extra $$ and fly Delta. We did find a direct flight out of Provo, only flight we could find Allegiant Airlines. Not sure how this will go, but at least we will get to the beach at the end of day.

### "wouldn't help with a room"
Not Verified | The day before our flight left Reno, Jetblue emailed saying our flight would be late. As a result, we missed our connecting flight in FLL & JAX. The rep for Jetblue said she could book us the following day, but wouldn't help with a room. We're still stuck here waiting for a supposed flight that we had to change gates for. All in all, it's taken us 24 hours to fly from Reno to Jacksonville via Jetblue. No amount of leg room or TV screens will EVER bring us back to your airline.

### "I cannot recommend this company"
Not Verified |  I cannot recommend this company in any way! We checked via phone. Arrived at the Airport 2 hours early after verifying flight. The check in machines were down. Long, long lines. People were yelling at the counter people. All these people could have easily been helped with the simple announcement ‘flight xyz has been canceled due to xxx.’ But no, they made everyone go through a long, hot line at Ft Lauderdale to tell us one by one that our flight had been canceled! The next flight to our destination was the following day at 8;00 pm!! 24 hours, no hotel accommodation, no complimentary ticket via another airline! Worse, I was told I had to apply online for a refund! That system wasn’t working. I waited on the phone for 50 minutes to have some guy 1st tell me my ticket was non-refundable. Then without apologizing he said there would be a $100 cancellation fee that I had to pay with the same credit card because they could not process a partial refund! I kid you not! What a joke!! Breeze Airline had a spot, they have been awesome!

### "Awful service at airport"
Not Verified | Awful service at airport. They had made a mistake with bag tag that was 100 % the airlines fault, they still would not help me, had to wait in line for an hour. No service whatsoever, I will avoid this airline at any cost in the future

### "Last time I’ll use this trash airline"
This airline finds any way possible to delay. They are a 10/10 at delaying and not communicating. Last time I’ll use this trash airline. I’ve taken several flights in the past year and every single flight has had some sort of major delay.

### "awful response from customer service"
On June 16th, my husband and I were set to fly out of Cancun at noon. We received notification that the flight was delayed, but the email also said they were working to resolve it and to come to the airport on time anyway. Long story short, we spend over 12 hours waiting as our flight kept getting delayed. I attempted to contact customer service several times but received no update or information. In fact, the customer service chat was very rude. In the end, at the very last minute, our flight was canceled with no information. We were automatically booked on the next flight out the following day. The biggest problem with this story is that I was personally hosting a baby shower for my best friend on the 17th. JetBlue gave us no opportunity to rebook the flight, (and they ADMITTED they knew it was going to be canceled early in the day), nor did they allow us to cancel on our own to reschedule through a different airline. So 4 months of planning a baby shower and a lot of money spent, they had nothing to offer me. I've cried several times over this. To top it off, my husband and I stayed at a highly nice resort, The Excellence, during our vacation, and JetBlue put us up in a motel in Cancun that was not even 1% comparable, and to be honest, a little scary with no security. They also offered us "dinner" - a four-plate buffet of stale food at 11:00 p.m. at night. It was absolutely AWFUL. In the end, on the day of our departure (the 17th) we both received an apology email clearly stating that THEY screwed up and it was an "avoidable cancellation. They then went on to offer a $100 credit to each of us. $100! What does that even get us? We don't get our time back, let alone enough credit to take another flight! We spent hours at an airport and spending money on food. $100 doesn't nearly cover it. Last night wrote a long email to the executives that I could find, and the response that I received was "Too bad, you only get $100. I have never in my life had such a worse travel experience nor received the most awful response from customer service.

### "We are very disappointed"
Not Verified |  La peor experiencia que hemos tenido con una aerolínea . No tienen la capacidad y mucho menos la profesionalidad para resolver cualquier problema. Después de muchas horas de espera en el aeropuerto y de retrasar nuestro vuelo, al final después de 7 horas lo cancelaron. La aerolínea nos mando un hotel y para sorpresa nuestra nos pusieron en un vuelo larguísimo de más de 7 horas en American Airlines sin siquiera preguntarnos nada. Cuando nos presentamos frente al staff para buscar solución como siempre nunca tienen solución para nada. Estamos muy decepcionado de cómo manejan las situaciones con sus clientes, que pagamos nuestros boletos completos para al final no tener derecho a nada. The worst experience we have ever had with an airline. They do not have the capacity, much less the professionalism to solve any problem. After many hours of waiting at the airport and delaying our flight, they finally canceled it after 7 hours. The airline sent us a hotel and to our surprise they put us on a very long flight of more than 7 hours on American Airlines without even asking us anything. When we appear in front of the staff to find a solution, as always, they never have a solution for anything. We are very disappointed in how you handle situations with your clients, that we pay our full tickets to end up not being entitled to anything.

### "Lack of clear communication"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. Lack of clear communication. Doesn't offer solutions nor options for their delays causing lost of connections. If you thought Spirit was bad, JetBlue is the worst!

### "on more than 4 occasions delays"
Nightmare. Bad service and on more than 4 occasions delays and have to lose the next flight. And another flight again same thing. Terrible airline. I would never advise someone to use this airline

### "I will never forgive JetBlue"
JetBlue customer service and system is pathetic. We came to St Thomas on vacation but had a family emergency & need to return immediately. I called Jet Blue to inquire about options. It took so long to get a human, then she didn’t seem to understand the situation, then she could only cancel our existing return but couldn’t book our new return. We spent 4.5 hours talking to 3 different people, and by then there were no flights available for tomorrow. Desperate, we tried to book flights for the next day, and Jet Blues awful app would not take my payment—USING a Jet Blue credit card! I tried another credit card, then another, nothing. I was frantic! It turns out the app had raised the ticket price while I was putting in my information (which I shouldn’t have to do. I fly every week and have a rewards membership). I am livid and disgusted by JetBlue. There is no reason not to hire intelligent agents-and plenty of them-who take ownership of a problem, and no reason not to empower them to solve problems. If these agents had not taken 4.5 hours to cancel a flight and “manually” refund points, then we would be at my family’s bedside. I will never forgive JetBlue, and I’m cutting up my Jet Blue credit card.

### "They leave exit rows empty"
They leave exit rows empty rather than let anyone sit there. Horrible customer service policy. Garbage profiteering waste of legroom. The attendants would rather leave exit rows unoccupied, which seems unsafe, than let anyone get something they didn't pay for.

### "wouldn’t recommend it"
Not Verified | Terrible accommodations. My seat cushion felt like it was loose. Every time I moved it would move. My tv never worked. There was left over trash in cup holder from prior flight. Very disappointed. I wouldn’t recommend it.

### "services getting worse"
Not Verified | For the last couple months, I have been dissatisfied with the service. There has been delays upon my trip back home. I can understand an hour but to have to sit in the airport for 7 hours is ridiculous. When you are not being told substantial reason is even more unacceptable. This is an inconvenience to me as I have other important things to take care of. In addition, having to come at the initial time frame of the original flight is even more ridiculous. Having to come to the airport at 2:00pm and not leaving until after 9:30pm does not make any sense to me. I have been flying with JetBlue for years and it seems like the services is getting worse. There is more fees added and decrease in adequate services. I am going to have to take my service elsewhere.

### "never fly JetBlue ever again"
Not Verified |  We tried to fly home from New York JFK to Albuquerque on Jet Blue Flight #0065 on Friday, June 2, but it turned out to be a total customer service nightmare. We sat on the runway for 2 hours waiting on a “weather delay” while watching other airlines take off and land. After the initial “weather delay” announcement, the flight crew and attendants were non-responsive to our passenger questions and would not provide any further updates on when we would be taking off. After this 2-hour delay, it was announced that we were returning to the gate because the flight crew could not exceed their “flight time hours”. While waiting for an additional 2 hours for a new flight crew to show up but never did, the gate staff were very dismissive and would not provide any updates on our flight departure. We also never received any e-mail or text updates from JetBlue like we did before the flight. After watching our luggage being unloaded from the plane, the gate staff finally admitted that the flight was canceled. After being told to pick up our luggage at baggage claim and to report to a ticketing office to be booked on JetBlue Flight #0066 or on another flight the next morning, we and the other 200+ passengers waited for another 2 hours in a long line while being chastised by ticketing staff to be more patient! After noticing that Flight #0066 was canceled without explanation and after being informed by other passengers that new tickets or hotel accommodations were not being issued by the ticketing staff, it became clear to us that customer service is not a priority for Jetblue so we decided to buy tickets on Delta Airlines at a considerable cost for our return flight home. This was our first and last flight on JetBlue. We will never fly JetBlue ever again.

### "not happy with my experience"
Not Verified |  Could not get baggage ticket at kiosk. Flight was late and no notice was given. Waited over 60 minutes for luggage. Missed Logan express due to the delay. Had to take Uber. Am not happy with my experience.

### "will never use this airline again"
I originally booked a 9 am Jet Blue , B6-340 departure Jacksonville Fl that i would arrive in NY well ahead of The drive rush hour to CT some 39 miles away. JB changed my flight to a 12:30 flight that got me to NY at 2:45, middle of the rush hour. 3 hour drive in heavy traffic to CT. RETURN FLIGHT June 7. Flight 2339 Flight delayed 3 1/2 hours as they used our aircraft for a fully booked flight to Tampa, our Jacksonville flight was about 60% populated. The cabin crew or dispatcher or whomever is responsible for catering the aircraft failed to notify the caterer of the new time, gate etc whatever is needed for the caterer to know where to meet the aircraft. Many passengers were aware of the aircraft switch off and voiced their disapproval of this move. I heard many folks like myself resolve to never fly Jet Blue again. The crew did a very nice job of taking care of us however they could not offer hit coffee or tea as the plane was not catered, Jet Blue offered us a 50$ credit which is nonuse to me as i will never use this airline again. This is the third time JB has botched my flights from or to NY where I travel on a monthly basis. On one JB flight that was cancelled I booked a Delta flight home from JFK after getting a cab from LGA so i would not have to wait 36 hrs for a connecting flight thru Boston to get home to Jacksonville flying Jet Blue. This cost me 559$. No more Jet Blue, they really do not manage the company as though they care about the passenger.

### "going to stop flying JetBlue"
Not Verified |  After a grueling day getting off a cruise ship and waiting hours to pass through Immigration and Customs, my daughter and I learned that our flight was delayed .. not once or twice but several times. Their excuse was inclement weather in the northeast but as it turns out (as I happened to overhear from two airport staff guys later that day), flight crews had refused to work our flight back to NY. Two hours after we were originally supposed to depart, they canceled our flight with no real explanation. I scrambled to rebook another flight home and our only option was a flight on American to NJ instead of NY. I booked it though the app, ended up paying for our seats, and though we finally made it back, my grief wasn't over. I have been trying to claim miles/points for that flight for us since and repeatedly that request was denied! Jetblue lies about how to get your miles/points. You can request them all you want but you'll never get them. I'm going to stop flying JetBlue. I'll fly with a carrier that actually cares about their customers. Save yourself the aggravation and do the same.

### "last flight with this horrific airline"
Not Verified |  This airline no longer allows carry-on bags for passengers sitting in the rear of the plane, unless you purchase an upgraded seat (approx $54-$75). They now operate on a discriminatory “class system” policy and it sickens me. This will be my last flight with this horrific airline.

### "Why is this airline so incompetent"
A medical emergency is what caused me to book a quick flight to Tampa. My sister had been hit by a car and was in the hospital. JetBlue had June 5th at 7:09am available. I chose that. Returning June 8th. I got to the airport only to see the flight was canceled and rescheduled for the next day. The next morning I arrived and their system didn’t show I was issued a ticket for the flight. I arrived for my only (20 minute) layover in Boston. But that got delayed to 2.5 hours. Why is this airline so incompetent? But hey, it was all worth it because they gave me a $50 credit for cancelling the flight on June 5.

### "don’t know where my bags are"
Not Verified |  The worst Airline. I had a flight which was supposed to be Saturday 3 rd Austin to Boston, Boston to Cibao international airport I got there did all my checking in spend 7 hours in the airport and they cancelled my flight without explanation, all right decided to take a deep breath things happen, so today Monday June 5th they rebooked the flight. Everything when perfect, landed waited 2 hours for my luggage just to find out they weren’t here at Santiago - all right went to claim it, the lady was just like oh I don’t know where your luggage it’s your receipts shows at inactive, why would they give me a receipt if it is inactive? Then she said that she cannot give me info about where is my luggage and that she doesn’t. I don’t know where my bags are, don’t have any clothes anything and they have the audacity to say “jetblue is the best airline

### "very disappointed"
Not Verified | My family and I have been Jet Blue customers for years and I am wanting to simply change a flight, not looking for a refund or a credit of any sort. The original flight that was booked was MORE expensive than the flight I am looking to change to. However, Jet Blue is wanting to charge twice the amount with all of its fees. I am very disappointed in how customer service treats its customers and will think twice about booking with your airline in the future.

### "experience was extremely disappointing"
Not Verified |  The booking process went smoothly. However, the cancellation experience was extremely disappointing as there were no alternative options provided. The customer support agent I spoke with was rude, lacked compassion, and proved to be unhelpful. I had no choice but to book another flight with a different airline, which came at a significant expense, just to reach my destination 12 hours later than planned, causing me to be late for a speaking engagement. Moreover, when I called to reschedule my return trip, I encountered a similar lack of empathy and was informed that one flight's cancellation had no impact on the booking of another. To make matters worse, there were no options provided to speak to a supervisor, despite being told that I was already speaking to one who displayed the same rudeness and lack of understanding. Overall, while I used to consider Jetblue a reliable airline, this experience has significantly diminished my confidence in them. From now on, they will not be my top choice for air travel.

### "Will never use JetBlue again"
Avoid. Flight schedule at 5pm. On the way to the airport was notified flight delay to 11pm. Eventually reduced to 9pm. Enough to arrive late and miss all connections to Europe. Stayed all night at BOS Airport, had to rebook in the morning, had to wait at BOS Airport all day. Will never use JetBlue again. Also, airplane was old and looked pretty bad inside.

### "worst customer service"
The worst customer service I have experienced. I lost my flight since employees were too busy doing a shift hand over. I was put in a flight for the next day which was longer and on top of that delayed. Worst airline to fly.

### "I will never fly JetBlue again"
Not Verified |  Haven't even flown with them yet and it's already been super stressful. I booked flight on my cruise line to the Eastern Caribbean for a vacation package with airfare from San Jose to Miami for the first Saturday of June (this weekend) and I have had to pick my same seats next to my friend THREE times already. First time, no charge, included in my itinerary (as it should be) but the connecting flight was originally too close to boarding time for the cruise, so they moved the connecting flight to one that is earlier and even though our original flight from San Jose to our layover was the same, they cancelled our seats for both flights. I had to book the same seats (with a cost). I messaged their chat and was assured by the agent I'd receive a refund for the seats while still guaranteed my original seats next to my friend for both flights. I check my itinerary today to confirm and they cancelled my seats when they refunded me. I chatted with them again today and there's nothing they can do, so now I have had to pay for my flights, seats, and baggage for eachflight (4 total at $35 each flight for just my one check bag and $30 for my seats each way) 3 days before my already expensive vacation. I will never fly JetBlue again. I don't even care if the service on the flights re good. This stress and expense is unacceptable right before a vacation.

### "Horrible service"
Our flight got cancelled, they called us to tell us about it less than 2 hours before the flight. We were already in a taxi. They booked us on another flight 4 hours later with a 3 hour stop in Boston. Our flight originally was non stop. This is the second time within a month they’re doing this. I will try to avoid traveling with them again. Horrible service

### "worst flight experiences"
Plane arrived in Ft Lauderdale and I proceeded to the carousel to retrieve my bag. I waited nearly three hours for the bags to be delivered. Apparently it was raining and lightning and the airline would not send crews out in the weather. Three hours seems like a long wait, but if it was for security reasons, I would have understood. However, Jet Blue never sent a rep to inform people of the issue, how it was being resolved or how long it would take. There were a multitude of carousels with people waiting for bags and JB was NO help. They were making announcements over a PA system that most of us could not hear or understand. There were a few JB employees - waiting with passengers. I approached one and asked if he knew what the problem was. He suggested I go to the Baggage Service Office. There were three women sitting there. Not one of them wandered out of their office to explain to everyone at the airport waiting for luggage what the problem was. When I asked she said "I just spoke with them. They're working on it. The lack of concern and professionalism was very disappointing. One passenger said her husband got an $80 ticket waiting for her. My friends waited over 2 hours in the cell phone lot - one of them is in a wheelchair. No offer of some kind of compensation or an apology. I also had spotty wi-fi. Not the first time this has happened to me on a JB flight. It used to be my preferred airline. Next flight I will shop around. This was one of the worst flight experiences I've ever had. No wonder they're #7. I remember when they used to be #1 customer rated.

### "got charged for a small bag"
I got charged for a small bag as a carry on luggage. On their websites says it is only 35 dollars but they charge me $65, also my luggage came completely destroyed.

### "dropping quality drastically"
JetBlue is dropping quality drastically, they are currently changing the time of the midnight flight from Guatemala to NYC almost every other day. Today they delayed the flight 3 hours meaning that all passengers spent 6 hours waiting at the airport, they simply offered a Mac Donalds menu (seriously?). If the lack of respect to passengers and low quality persists I will avoid this airline moving forward.

### "Frequent delays with no communications"
Frequent delays with no communications or notifications. Their horrible IT system is not updated with latest flight information. Flight was delayed but their app showed on-time and even that the flight already departed when people were still waiting at boarding gate.

### "they make you wait for hours"
Delay, delay, delay, dump of an airline. They know the flights never taking off, they make you wait for hours. They give half answers with every question.

### "JetBlue is just simply unreliable"
JetBlue is just simply unreliable and your time is valuable. The website is so glitched you end up calling a clueless, helpless reservation agent. If you do manage a successful online transaction with an actual confirmation code be sure to triple check because chances are it will be an incomplete record because the payment process never works. We find this to be specific to the seat assignment, or extras. You book your flight, you pay for your seat upgrade, you show up to the airport in plenty of time and then delay delay delay delay .. and/or cancel. Save yourself the expense and aggravation.

### "Jetblue is making my blood boil"
Not Verified |  I never even got to fly to my destination, Jetblue robbed me of over $1000 and are trying to shift the blame on me. I booked a honeymoon flight for my wife and I back in 2021, which we could not take because of covid restrictions. We were issued travel credits (that expire for no apparent reason) instead of a refund. Now we had to scramble to find the time and money to take a vacation within their expiry period during a global pandemic. We tried to book a flight for a shorter vacation, but the schedule would not work out for us so we would have to postpone by canceling that next flight. They gave us a hard time for even doing that like we were trying to find some loophole to buy more time (but why do these even expire?). Then we could finally cancel it and receive MOST of our credit back and they sent an email saying the credit will be valid until it expires (1 year per their policy), but they did not list the date on the email. I tried to go back and book a summer vacation using point I knew I had and saw those points expired THE DAY AFTER THE REFUND. I called to ask them to reinstall that credit since there was no warning and customer service hung up on me. I called back and someone at the escalation department was saying it was my fault for not being responsible with the credit! The gall on these people trying to gaslight and steal from me! Then when I asked how could this corporation have the heart to do this to someone who saved their hard earned money for their honeymoon that was shafted by the pandemic, they hung up on me again. Jetblue is making my blood boil! I tried citing them to the BBB but they sent some pre-generated response about the BBB not having jurisdiction over them because of the Airline Deregulation Act.

### "JetBlue is exploiting the Caribbean"
Not Verified |  JetBlue is exploiting the Caribbean with extremely high fares for the poorest service in return. The tickets economy class are 1700usd one way, in return most of the flights are over 1-4 hrs delayed on a constant. The agents are extremely rude not even a welcome on board, no ice for any of the beverages and the list goes on. I hope that they won’t find themselves in the same situation as American Airlines that did the same thing in exploiting the Caribbean countries, and now no one from the islands make them 1st choice when traveling. Also there is a fee attached to everything.

### "The worst airline experience"
The worst airline experience. After destroying my bag, the claims office at the Boston airport made all these promises and for a brief moment, I felt assured I'd be taken care of. Not only are they negligent but they're trying to get away with not paying me. Airport staff took photos of every item damaged, and I provided receipts for 10 out of 13 items (who even keeps receipts from years ago!? ), still no payment is being made as they're trying to get away with not paying me.

### "standards have desperately fallen"
Not Verified | Jetblue has very poor in customer service overall. I had already booked two luggage’s with the reservation but needed to pay for an additional two pieces ! I had no card but Apple Pay I was told to go to the atm and withdraw the cash. I had no card hence not having access to withdraw with the card! There are limited options for paying. Come on it’s 2023! I asked three agents to help me to pay in the Jetblue app and they did not know how to proceed - very distasteful of this airline. I had previously held such high expectations and esteem of this airline. I will take my services elsewhere. There were also not one seat for customers the elderly and very young can benefit from having such. Overall the standards of this airline have desperately fallen.

### "incredible customer service"
I arrived at airport 1.5 hours early and did not make flight because of slow workers at airport. I made it to the boarding door 60 seconds, yes 60 seconds late and they would not let me board. Man was completely rude. Again 60 seconds late because of airport workers. They gave me another flight almost 4 hours later causing me to miss an important meeting. They also did not assign me a seat and instructed me to go to new gate and speak with attendant there. SHE WAS FANTASTIC, explained everything in detail and was super nice with incredible customer service skills. She bought me back to Jet Blue. Incredible person and deserves many prompts. I actually bought her a gift card for her caring and respect of my situation.

### "beyond ridiculous to be charged even more"
Not Verified |  JetBlue cancelled our flight to Fort Myers, FL minutes before we were to leave for the airport. I followed instructions to switch flights online, and when I did so, found that the next flight to Fort Myers was 2 days out. To travel the same day, I was forced to take a flight to nearby Tampa, FL instead. I was charged an additional $320 to do this. However, in the "Flights Cancelled by JetBlue" section of the "Delays, Cancellations, and Schedule Changes" page on the website (https://www.jetblue.com/help/delays-and-cancellations), it states that I should be able to switch to another flight at no charge if JetBlue cancelled. I contacted them through their website to request a refund, which was denied on the grounds that they claim that I willfully elected to fly to a different city - this is a completely ridiculous claim, since they cancelled the flight, and the next flight to the same city was multiple days out. No other flights were cancelled or delayed at all that day, indicating no staffing issues. There was no inclement weather on either end. This implies that they must have cancelled because not enough people were on the flight, so it was no longer profitable. It's concerning that US-based airlines are allowed to do this with flights at the last possible minute. As if JetBlue hasn't already jerked me around enough: 5 weeks after the flight, I got an email from them saying I was "undercharged" for services offered, and they're going to charge me even more this coming week. It was aggravating enough to be refused a refund, but beyond ridiculous to be charged even more well over a month after the cancelled flight. Beginning to enter scam-like territory.

### seem to be heading towards rock bottom"
Not Verified |  As a loyal customer for over 25 years, I have been constantly discouraged by their services over the past recent years, which seem to be heading towards rock bottom. While I understand that times have been tough for many, JetBlue is the only company I interact with where its employees consistently have blatant attitude problems and clearly don't care about its customers. I’m a laid-back person and can deal with lost bags, delayed flights, and less-than-ideal hubs, but when it’s employees consistently seem angry and look down upon their clients, I cannot help but use another service. During my last trip, there was a system malfunction that swapped my flight out and upon calling the service, they were beyond unreasonable in lending assistance for an issue that was their fault in the first place. Another experience that has left me feeling disrespected and disappointed. I am officially done with JetBlue. I hope this serves as a warning to others who may be considering their services. Stick with Delta, Southwest, American, or even discount airlines such as Spirit or Frontier – the staff is friendlier and helpful and their planes are fine if not better for many flights. FYI: The overall flight and employees are particularly bad flying from New York to Fort Lauderdale and New York to Savannah.

### "claim I was never charged"
Charged me at the time of purchase for bags, now a week later they charge me another $153 and claim I was never charged, I tried to dispute it and was willing to send them proof of the charges, they weren't interested in assisting me it all.

### "JetBlue ruined our experience"
Flight scheduled to leave (DCA) Reagan National Airport at 8:55 am to (FLL) Fort Lauderdale, Fl, arriving at 11:38 am. My husband and I were also scheduled to board a cruise ship in Miami, which we scheduled ground transportation from the FLL airport. We had to be on board the ship no later than 3:00 pm. The flight was first delayed to leave at 10:31 am, which caused concern for us as time would be cutting it close but we decided to not panic. This was announced at around 8:30 am. Not even 1 hour after the first delay, it was announced that we were delayed again to leave at 12:30pm! Meanwhile, at the gate next to us, 2 aircrafts scheduled for West Palm Beach, Fl (1 left at approximately 9 and the other boarding at approximately 11) seemed to have no problem. The desk attendants finally let us know that the aircraft was having mechanical issues and that they were working on it. We tried to get on another flight but were told that we would not be able to get our luggage and that West Palm Beach was more than an hour away from Miami. We had to contact the transportation/cruise line to cancel our trip. This was extremely disappointing and heartbreaking. We had planned for months to have a vacation and JetBlue ruined our experience. We found out that the flight was again delayed to 1:30 and subsequently, it left at 2:21, arriving at FLL at 5:08 pm! JetBlue could have announced that there were mechanical issues from the start and offered us optional flights at 8:55. Having a flight credit and adding 100.00 to our account could not and would not replace the memories stolen from us. My husband chose this airline because he was offered a credit card to accumulate points and benefits. So we were let down all the across the board.

### "denied to give any refund"
Not Verified |  They are not professional. Won't recommend anyone to fly with this airline. Booked one flight with them. Departure was 11 pm. Flight got delayed and staff was not aware if it was delayed or cancelled. Later they says it will be delayed for 24 hours. But without any information, flight departed nest day 5.30 pm. Keeping me as no show and denied to give any refund.

### "I had a terrible experience"
Not Verified |  I had a terrible experience with this airline - it was undoubtedly the worst I've ever flown with. My flight was delayed by three hours, which was highly inconvenient as I had to catch another flight right after. I requested the staff to book me on an alternate flight, but their service was incompetent and careless. Based on my experience, I do not recommend it.

### "lack of organization, poor customer service"
I recently had the displeasure of flying with Jetblue Airways flight 668 from Punta Cana to New York and it was a complete nightmare from start to finish. The check-in process was ok but once on board, we were greeted by an extremely rude and full of attitude airhostess. We were a family of four with two babies. We had to take the long ramp up the flight and I had foldable overhead stroller which one of babies was sitting in. The air hostess kept taunting and making comments on how I should have folded my stroller before boarding. She refused to help with my stuff. She threw my jackets on the floor. After that she started complaining about our carry on and that we should have checked that in as well. They told us they were upgrading us at the check in counter and charged us $500 but there is no business class on Jetblue, its all the same seats. The seats were uncomfortable and cramped, with no room to move or stretch out. Both air hostess gave us attitude till we got off. We were already stressed out as kids were not feeling well. We were treated horribly. We traveled to Punta CAna from NY on American Airlines and such a wonderful experience and service from everyone. Unfortunately, we had to take Jetblue back due to a family emergency but the flight attendants made sure we were treated badly. Overall, I would not recommend flying with Jetblue to anyone. Their lack of organization, poor customer service made us so uncomfortable.

### "they were not eager to assist at all"
Not Verified |  I am a senior and kindly asked the flight attendants to help me lift my bag to place overhead, they were not eager to assist at all, one of them said he had shoulder surgery and the other one did not lift it for me he just helped me to place it overhead. If they are so sickly and unable to lift a small suitcase maybe that is not the right job for them. It is the one and only complaint that I have.

### "had a horrible experience"
I travelled JetBlue for the first time and had a horrible experience. Firstly the flight was delayed and they lost our luggage. We had very important material for our fair and as exhibitors we did not have items to showcase. More so it was so difficult to reach them, we don’t have an update yet it’s Been 2 days. It’s been a bad experience, so disappointed, would never take this flight again.

### "they refused to assist"
After FLL closed due to flooding they rescheduled my return flight 4 days later, only for that flight to be delayed several times throughout the day and ultimately cancelled in the evening leaving myself and my children scrambling to make last minute accommodations. They refused to compensate saying it was due to weather when the customer service counter told me they were awaiting crew members. Caught in LIES!! This was now 6 days after the flooding, 6 days of additional expenses they refused to assist with. I am no longer a JetBlue customer after this.

### "absolutely worthless"
If you're looking to get to your destination on time, JetBlue is absolutely worthless! They are apparently now among the list of worst airlines for cancellations and delays. Not only was our initial flight from SLC to FLL (and then to PUJ) delayed 4 times, it was finally cancelled, for something not only under their control, but something they would have known about for hours and didn't let the passengers know until about 3 in the morning (their phone support even attempted to say it was due to weather, but there were no weather issues in SLC or JFK where the flight crew was coming from, and we even verified that with the airline). Which means we missed our connecting flight. Then they rebooked us taking a completely different route to our final destination (JFK instead of FLL), which was then delayed and delayed and delayed, making the connecting flight a problem once again. We spend HOURS and HOURS on support with them, trying to get everything situated. We missed out on about $1000 in resort time that we had paid for, not including our time, gas, and other things we had to pay for. And JetBlue's response? Too bad, so sad. They took zero responsibility, and very rudely said they wouldn't do anything for us, even after being very calm with them. Pathetic airline. Will never use them again, and will be cancelling our JetBlue card. Not worth the extra legroom if you can't get to where you need to be on time.

### "worst budget airline to fly with"
I tried to check in via Jetblue website on my phone but at credit card payment screen it timed out and I had to download the app to check in. I checked in as normal and head to the airport the next day with my family, the check-in machine at the airport could only print one of the check bags tags and we had to wait in line to check our other 2 bags. All went well till I got my credit card statement and JetBlue charged an additional USD45 for a 4th bag. I phoned JetBlue customer service team explain the issue and after an hour of holding and keep explaining to different people they came back that there is nothing they can do as the mistake was done at the airport and there is no way for them to verify that only 3 bags was checked. I explained I have the email confirming that there was only 3 bags but they still could give me a credit. Its ridicules that their customers cannot pay for carrier on if you are not a JetBlue member and have to pay for checked baggage, we had to pay for seat selection as well on our connecting flight from JFK to YVR to complete the check-in process, money grab. First and last time I will fly with JetBlue, their service is horrible and they dont care about the customers. I have flown with budget airlines before but for the expensive price you have to pay to get such bad service they are by far the worst budget airline to fly with.

### "they refused to let me board"
I googled extensively and was flying to see a friend in Barbados who said no entry requirements and that you will fill out the form once you land in Barbados. 30 minutes before my flight leaves I get called to the boarding desk to show the "entry form" and barcode which I of course did not have. I tried the site and filling it out twice but the site was not working. It is not required beforehand and this was from an official immigration officer at Barbados) I'm not angry at the people at the boarding desk because I do understand they were doing their job but they refused to let me board the plane until I had this particular document which I could not get at all because the site is not working. A nice manager walked out and had to get on a computer for 20 minutes and by so miracle got it handled so I could board the plane. I was livid and so upset that I was not going to be allowed to board my plane over something that is not even necessary! Truly the immigration officer at Barbados thought the whole thing was ridiculous and everyone else on the plane (coming from the US) was able to fill out their form at customs. They thought what happened to me was insane and did not understand why the San Jose Airport/Jet Blue demanded I have that and almost denied me getting on that plane. The first plane ride was 4 hours and a red eye and absolute hell. They kept the lights on the entire time, and the flight attendants kept coming up and down the aisle hitting me with elbow/tray at least 20 times. They were angry. 40 minutes before landing they start screaming at everyone to wake up and the person next to me in the middle seat had her seat back and was sound asleep with her hood over her eyes. A flight attendant walked up and stood over me to forcibly yank her seat back, yank her hood off and tell her to"wake up. They then just glared at me to remove the bag off my lap while we still had 30 minutes to land. On my next flight to Barbados, no one asked for this stupid entry form when I was boarding which I thought was super comical. I was in a middle seat and when I sat down there was stuff in the aisle seat but no one around. Flight attendants kept asking me over and over whose stuff it was and I'm like don't know. Finally a sweet older lady comes up with a cane and says everybody calm down, I was at the back of the plane allowing everyone to come though because it's really hard for me to get up and down (come to find out the poor lady had a knee injury). Flight attendants were so rude to her. I had been flying for over 12 hours and was extremely thirsty and kept getting such attitude when I asked for water. I asked one male attendant who never brought it to me & when I asked the female attendant a second time for more water in my water bottle and a sparkling water, she rolls her eyes and fills up my water bottle halfway and doesn't give me a sparkling water and just walks away.

### "delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours"
Not Verified |  JetBlue has to be the worst airline flying out of South Florida right now especially since the fort Lauderdale closure on April 12th JetBlue has canceled the late night fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas flight (flight 607) three times. One flight was canceled on a Monday which 3 days after they actually opened up the airport. That also means that the people in Las Vegas waiting for flight 607 cannot get back to fort Lauderdale because the flight never gets to Las Vegas! The ripple effects are disastrous JetBlue also has four local flights such as fort Lauderdale to Jacksonville and Jacksonville back to the fort Lauderdale and fort Lauderdale to Cuba and Cuba back to fort Lauderdale (flight number 17, 18 1499 and 1500) and for the past 4 days each of them have been delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours with two of them being canceled all together and weather really has nothing to do with it since April 15th the weather has been fine down here we have had very little rain. But even the four local flights which are only about an hour and 20 minutes apart also been delayed 3 to 6 hours or have been canceled About a year ago Jetblue stated to the public that they will have fewer frequency of flights which will allow them more flexibility when things go wrong but obviously that is not the case.

### "give our seats to flight attendants"
Not Verified |  On Thursday April 13,23 my husband and I traveled with 4 kids, our flight was scheduled for 8:55 it was delayed to 9:30 no problem, we get to the terminal we were told the flight was delayed again to 10:18pm so we walked around with the kids and got back to our gate to find no one was there we asked a JetBlue employee was the gate changes and she responded no the plane boarded already but we said we were told to come back at 9:45 figure it was only 9:15pm. They got confused there was two flights leaving to JFK, we were given the wrong gate number so the lady told us we would have to wait, only 2 seats available only our flight but figure we have 6 tickets. I purchased my infant a seat and had no choice but to fly with my infant and 5 year old. My husband had to wait and get on the next flight with my 8 year old and 9 year old. When we asked why we don’t have seats we were told they had to give our seats to flight attendants so why not notify us prior. JetBlue broke my stroller and all they gave me was a credit for my infant seat, disgusting.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience. Delay after extended delay and the crew is acting like it’s just another day with little regard for how much our days have been turned inside out. Their only recourse is to offer points for the next trip with JetBlue. Why on earth would anyone travel with them again.? Do not travel with JetBlue. The few dollars saved is not worth spending an entire day in an airport n missing functions because of delayed flights.

### " they left her high and dry"
Not Verified |  My mom came out to visit us. When going home her flight was cancelled after she sat on the plane for an entire day. Instead of being helpful and trying help her get home, they left her high and dry. She was forced to rebook without any help and had to buy a much more expensive ticket to get home. They reimbursed her for the original ticket only. She got home 24 hours later than she was supposed and paid them for the privilege.

### "pay extra for everything"
Absolutely will never fly with this joke of a airline again. Not only did I have to pay extra for everything that should be included on a flight that costed me over $1,000, but the flight attendants had the worst attitude. I have diagnosed bipolar and I did not feel safe on this flight. I would literally fly spirit over this.

### "unprofessional unpleasant"
Not Verified | Terrible! Charges for bags Southwest give you for free - staff are unprofessional unpleasant and just lazy! I have flight credits for Jetblue they can just keep them! Awful experience! If I could give them no stars I would!

### "they want to steal from their customers"
Not Verified |  We had to cancel our flight due to Covid, we were given travel credit. Next I noticed my travel credit was removed from my account, I contacted them via chat and was told I had to use it within 5 days, I booked a flight but due to illness we had to cancel, but now I'm being told I loose my original travel credit of over $500. What I don't understand is why do they expire so soon, now they dont want to give me my travel credit back. Is like I gave them my money and they want me to book a reservation with the limit restrictions, if its my money either give it back or let me travel when I want to travel no when they tell me to travel. They truly are thieves, took over $500 as bad as economy is and they want to steal from their customers? Never will I fly with them again!

### "Had a horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Had a horrible experience due to a unapologetic passenger leaning her seat back until it reached my knees. Instead of me loosing my cool, after asking her to politely lean her seat up just a bit so my legs aren’t smushed, she caught a major attitude and said no. I called a flight attendant for assistance and the flight attendant instantly took sides stating the passenger in front of me had the right to lean her seat back to her comfortability, which is totally understandable planes are small and not as roomy, however allowing someone to violate someone else personal space for there comfort is not fair nor okay instead of the flight attendant defusing the situation and coming up with a fair solution she quickly sided and then followed up her last sentence asking me if I understood as if I was the problem as the lady infront of me smiled. It was very degrading. I was emotionally bothered and out of place the whole 5hr which sucked for the amount of money paid.

### "such a horrible experience"
I am appalled at JetBlue. They cancelled my flight while I was at the airport and left me stranded with a 2 year old and 3 year old. The flight was cancelled b/c the airplane broke down, there was equipment failure caused by a maintenance issue. I scrambled to get a hotel. I was told by the JetBlue customer representative that I would be reimbursed for my hotel stay. I later find out they will not reimburse me for the hotel and instead gave me a travel bank credit of a very nominal amount compared to the inconvenience I endured. I tried to use the travel bank credit for a future flight found on JetBlue's website only to find out it wouldn't apply because the flight was by Jetblue but operated by another airline. I have never in my life had such a horrible experience with an airline. Imagine traveling with a screaming 2 year old and 3 year old. They gave me $50 credit as if that would sufficiently compensate for the entire suffering. We had to stay at a terrible airport hotel down the street which cost a fortune due to being last minute and JetBlue absolutely refuses to reimburse me for it. And now I can't even use this travel credit they gave me. I have travelled the world with various airlines and by far Jetblue is the worst airline./ Pay a little extra and book with another airline.

### "really frustrating"
Not Verified | While I generally have had a positive experience of JetBlue in past, I was shocked by JetBlue's late cancellation of its flight from Aguadilla to NYC. More than the cancellation, the agents at the airport told me that my hotel would be compensated for up to $250 given there were no more flights for the day. When I got home, the customer service agents said that this was not what they said, and that they likely meant, your hotel might be reimbursed up to that amount. It was really surprising and also given the hassle and additional expenses we had to incur to get a hotel and to another airport the next day, it was really frustrating.

### "The worst customer service ever"
The worst customer service ever. First of all received terrible service at the check in having a service dog. Second the flight was delayed for almost an hour. Went to get coffee, took me 10 min came back and the boarding was over How is that possible? The board was still showing expected, hey moved me to another flight to Fort Lauderdale. I can’t believe that I got service like that today.

### "told thank you without any further assistance"
Not Verified |  I was in Puerto Rico for a funeral and was notified at 2.40 pm that my 7pm flight was delayed until midnight. I tried to reschedule to a 9pm flight that same evening and had to either wait 15 minutes to chat with someone or 35 minutes for a phone call. I was advised that the 9pm flight was full and told thank you without any further assistance. I had to reschedule surgeries I was supposed to perform the next day as I would arrive home at 4am for work at 8am. I arrived to the airport at 10pm and once I got through security I was advised that the flight was delayed another hour. At this point I had to cancel the entire shift and will be sending an invoice to Jetblue for pay I missed. This airline is complete garbage and should absolute merge with Spirit to complete the partnership of trash airlines. They also charge $300 a seat and do not include a carry on.

### "seating assignment was changed"
Not Verified |  Purchased flight tickets 5 weeks in advance with confirmed seats. Two days before flight seating assignment was changed. Have heard similar stories where seating was changed last minute from others traveling on JetBlue flights. This is a real problem for families traveling with children who need to sit together. Added stress my last 2 flights had issue with TV service. Problem with audio or not working at all. Tried to call JetBlue customer service 800# after landing. Twice spent 70 minutes on hold. Never actually able to speak with a service rep.

### "impressed with our recent return flights"
Not Verified |  We were impressed with our recent return flights to New York with JetBlue. In this day and age it’s such a bonus when bags are included with the tickets. Both flights took off on time. We enjoyed the meal on the way out. Not so keen on the breakfast options on the return. No skimping on the drinks or the snacks. All in all a very pleasurable experience with ample legroom. Will definitely use them again.

### "memorable and beautiful trip"
Not Verified | Daniel and Catherine made a single mom, and recent survivor of cancer, flight a memorable and beautiful trip. Thank you both for showing me and my kids compassion and love still exist between strangers even though you didn’t even know what our situation was. We appreciate you both so much. Prayers and love from me and the kids.

### "no apology or additional credit"
Not Verified |  I’m beyond disappointed with the delays that I experienced with JetBlue for my flights to (flight 1759) and from (flight 8072) Kingston, Jamaica. I paid $590 for my flight and believed that I chose a good alternative to Delta, since Delta didn’t have any nonstop flights to Kingston at the time that I booked, however I was sadly wrong. My uncle and I arrived at JFK airport more than three hours in advance of departure and had to wait from 7am-3pm before we were able to take off. The reason we were given for the delay was that the plane hadn’t left Fort Lauderdale which is what we were told prior to the delay switching from 1:29pm to 3pm. JetBlue did email an apology but only offered a $50 credit, 8% of what I paid for my flight and $15 less than the fee for a checked bag on JetBlue needless to say significantly less than it would cost to book another flight. This may have sufficed if it only happened on the way to Kingston but leaving Kingston to JFK (originally flight 1060 switched to flight 8072) I received three emails that morning as I prepared for my flight, one stating that it has been delayed from 9:14am to 1:29pm but still requesting for me to arrive at the original time, the second email stating that it’s been canceled and then a third with a new flight number (8072) departing at 1:00pm. Another day on the same trip waiting at the airport from 6:30am to 1:00pm. I guess two hours earlier is an improvement in JetBlues eyes because I received no apology or additional credit. The only saving grace was that the flight crew was pleasant. Here’s the kicker, the reason for the delay was that the plane hadn’t left Fort Lauderdale. My uncle flew out the day before I did and also experienced the same half-day delay. This is truly unacceptable. It seems like it’s a common practice instead of a coincidence for their flights to Jamaica. Because of the delays going to Kingston my uncle and I had to get a hotel so we wouldn’t have to drive 2hrs that night to our final destination once we finally arrived. The credit doesn’t even measure up to the time wasted and additional money having to be spent due to the delays and same excuse. So please tell me why would I ever consider booking JetBlue to go anywhere else with a $50 credit to experience the same things.

### "She was extremely rude"
I have been flying Jet Blue for years and have said many good things about jet blue and hospitality from crew members. However yesterday flying from Aruba to Boston I had a very rude crew member on flight B6 273 on March 27th. I was being courteous waiting to go to the bathroom and when it was my turn this crew had answered the phone from the Pilot and stated we need to be seated for 15 min per the captains orders. I quickly went to use the bathroom and stated I am so sorry It’s an emergency I have to use the bathroom. She stated you need to sit back in your seat the captain has asked we remain seated for 15 min. Also you can not stand here I need to pull the seats out for the crew members to be seated. I did what I was told and went to be seated. Not even 10 min later another women had walked to use the bathroom and nothing was said to her. We had no turbulence. So I then became very annoyed I was spoken to like that when I just had to use the bathroom. After the lady had came out I walked up and she had the cart to serve water the passengers out. I said excuse me so I can get in the bathroom. With no response. So I slightly just moved the cart so I can get to the bathroom since I have been waiting like I was told. She then replied don’t touch the cart I will move it. There is a way to talk to passengers and this was not it. She was extremely rude. Not sure if she had a bad day but I have never been talked to or treated like that with jet blue crew members.

### "Great customer services"
Not Verified |  Would like to say a special thank you to Marcello from JetBlue baggage / lost property services. He went above and beyond to help me find and courier my lost passport. I was stuck in America without my South African passport and very stressed. The JetBlue staff in New York (baggage servers) were absolutely useless and incredibly rude and unhelpful. The JetBlue staff at West Palm Peach are completely opposite. They are phenomenal. Great customer services and going the extra mile. Thank you so much Marcello and west palm team.

### "it happens all the time with JetBlue"
My flight from Boston to West Palm was to take off at 12.pm, it has been delayed twice, now for 3.47 take off. Myself with a personal disability has been sitting for 4 hours in airport, it happens all the time with JetBlue, and I’m a frequent flyer!

### "Jetblue is the worst airline"
Jetblue is the worst airline. You think your saving money but you are not. My flight was supposed to leave at 320pm and got delayed several times, finally our plane is ready at 630pm and they gave our plane to another flight and delayed us again until 930pm. When I asked for compensation they just laughed.

### "never fly JetBlue"
Worst experience with airline ever. Our flight on the way down to FL was delayed but only for an hour. The way back was a terrible. Delayed from 1 PM to 2 PM then to 5 PM. Jet Blue moved us to the 4:15 Flight and that was delayed then finally canceled. The only thing Jet Blue would do is move us to a next day flight and then they would not even guarantee that flight because it was full. At the boarding gate they were so swamped the recommended that we call on our cell phone. When we did that we got redirected to a third party site that told us they would reimburse our Jet Blue tickets at full cost and book up on American Airlines but we would have to pay another 554 dollars now and get reimbursed later. After getting to the TPA airport expecting to get home at 4:00 PM EST we ended up not getting in until 1:00 AM the next day. After seeing only an 83 dollar reimbursement per ticket from Jet Blue I called just for Jet Blue to say we only get less than 1/4 of our tickets costs because it is cheaper to from from TPA to BLD then the other way. They said the third party was a scam and they held no responsibility for us having to pay extra for the flight home. This was all due to Jetblues planes breaking down and JetBlue not helping out their customers at all. Save yourself a headache and never fly JetBlue.

### "Absolutely horrid experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrid experience. Near 3 hour flight delay meant I missed all my connecting flights. They didn't have enough crew then apparently didn't check the plane was working correctly during that over hour delay and so we had another over hour delay. Jetblue would not help at all. They all seemed to agree I deserved compensation for the problems they caused me such as food voucher and hotel but they all said they couldn't do it themselves. In person staff said I had to do it online. Online said Jetblue in the airport had to do it. I showed them the messages from online and they said too bad. I asked online what to do now and who could I talk to, they also said too bad. They literally just abandoned me in NYC. I will curse their name to everyone who will listen for the rest of my life. What an awful thing to do, I hope you never expect to have a good brand reputation ever again.

### "Our flight crew was super sweet"
My husband and I had the opportunity to Travel with Jetblue Airways on March 4th 2023. Our flight crew was super sweet. Ms Bobbie who was our flight attendant was very patient and exude her medical expertise and professionalism. We would like to highlight her by thanking her so much for attending to our needs the entire flight. Flight 380 March 4th 2:30p -6:30p Montego Bay Jamaica to JFK

### "credits expire after 1 year"
JetBlue issued a credit today and then stated that the credit had already expired because the original booking date was over 1 year ago. They rob people of their money. I would never book a flight with JetBlue unless the ticket is completely refundable in cash and not their "airline credit. The credits expire after 1 year and are completely useless thereafter.

### "flight attendant Jorge was exceptional"
My flight to San Antonio was good. The flight attendant Jorge was exceptional. The other attendant was a little rude to us. However Jorge stepped in and made a great difference in our flight. I give him 5 stars.

### "super disappointed with the services"
Not Verified |  This was the first time traveling with the jet Blue, and also first international flight with them. I have to say that I am super disappointed with the services policies offered. First disappointment was that they charge for a check in bag. Who goes on a vacation abroad without a checked in bag? Ridiculous! Second disappointment was that they do not provide any complimentary meal. It doesn't have to be a full meal course like a rel  airline company does but at least provide a small meal/sandwich or something to hold you off on the 4 hours or more flights. Most international flights I have done (using international airlines, of course) provide that. At JFK airport, during the return, while awaiting for the customs, JetBlue did change the flight gate from one end to the other end, and did not notify the passenger that were at the customs, and the time between customs and the flight were cutting short, and passenger could end up missing the flight, having only minutes to make to the gate. That created a huge level of stress and frustration and this type of service is unacceptable.

### "The plane is tiny"
Not Verified |  Decent seat size, In flight complimentary meal, drinks and snacks. Selection of films/movies/ live tv to watch. Nice staff. The plane is tiny. I personally wouldn’t care about this except for the fact that the turbulence is horrendous. My partner vomited several times due to how rocky and up and down the plane was going. An aircraft that small would be fine for a 1-2 hour flight, but not London to New York. The smaller the plane the more you will feel the wind and turbulence. Because of how bad the turbulence was the seat belt sign was kept on the entire 7 hour flight barring one time in which the entire plane (understandably) rushed to go to the toilet. There was no word or explanation from the pilot as to why the turbulence was so severe or even an update as to when it may calm down. The air stewards just went along like nothing out of the ordinary was happening whilst simultaneously being thrown around the aisle trying to control the drinks trolley that was being shaken like mad. Take off and landing we’re genuinely terrifying. I will say that the flight home to London from New York was smoother, and the pilot  communicated over the speaker advising when there was turbulence and how long roughly it would last. So that was the plane, the customer service was very odd also. After the horrendous flight to NYC as soon as we got to our hotel I phoned jetblue customer service to ask about if there was anything we could do on the flight home to make it less inconvenient for other passengers when he would inevitably be sick again (not nice for people to see/hear). The lovely lady told me she would him move free of charge to a disabled/extended leg room seat that hadn’t been booked which was sat closer to the toilet and had a bit more room incase he was going to be sick again he wouldn’t be stuck in a tight row next to anyone. I was over the moon as it meant he would feel less embarrassed and hopefully less people would have to see him vomit. When I go to check in online on the morning of our flight I see the seat hasn’t changed, so I phone jetblue and they say yes you can have the seat but it’ll cost $100! I said the lady I spoke to said it would be FOC and she already reserved the seat and they said sorry she must’ve got it wrong and she isn’t allowed to do that - how do their staff not know what to do? So we go to the airport (jfk) and find the JetBlue help desk and explain to the lady there the situation, she thankfully says that’s no problem I’ve assigned you both the extra leg room seats for not extra cost and have made a note on your ticket that a wheelchair will be available back at Gatwick should he get very sick on the plane and need some assistance getting off. Thank god we spoke to the help desk (which shows they definitely did not need to charge us an extra $100) and got it sorted. I will say we had no delays, everything was on time.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Canceled flight after delayed for 3 hours. Took another 3 hours to get hotel accommodations. Delayed again the next day with no one letting us know what was going on. Worst airline ever. It’s not about the flight being cancelled, it’s about the way in which they handled it.

### "JB would be my last option"
Not Verified | First, don’t thanks us for choosing your airline, it was just the better time departure or arrival. If I had a choice JB would be my last option. This airline is ALWAYS DELAYED, DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM, delayed flight due to bad weather in NYC, when I called friends flying with different airlines at the same time were able to land in NYC, had to stay in hotel and rebook another flight in the AM. Not refundable because weather issue, right. Another flight delayed for 6 hours. Then today, getting to airport 2 hours before flying to St Maarten, trying to get my baggage checked with no success and got refused boarding 1.30 minutes because we are late. Never happened in 20 years traveling international. It looked like the plane was overbooked, I could not select a seat and ruin my vacations having to rebook my whole trip again. They do not care about customer service, they are here to grab every penny they can. DO NOT SUPPORT THEM.

### "Horrible customer service"
Never fly Jetblue. Horrible customer service. The 2 staff ladies at the gate are very very rude and derogatory. There was some confusion about “mosaic” status. It shows up on my account/app/website, but was not included in the booking. So they charged me an extra $65 at the gate for my carry-on bag (I purchased base fare but mosaic can ring carry-on regardless fare type). The lady was so rude, asked me step aside, doesn’t listen to my explanation, talk loudly over me and said “You need to give me your credit card for the charge, otherwise you can sort this out and take the next flight” I was shocked and angry and upset about how she treats me. I have my mosaic status through my corporate benefit. Maybe she thinks I’m lying because I look like a student? When I reached out to customer support later, they didn’t offer any refund or apologies. I asked to send my screenshot of my account. They said there’s no way they can receive a screenshot through email or chat. It’s just absurd. So I ended up having to pay $65 for a carry-on bag? I mean if I know I’m not mosaic anymore (if it doesn’t show up on my account), why would I not book a normal fare that allows carry-on? ?

### "Never flying this airline again"
Not Verified |  Terrible. 3 hour delay. Finally boarded the flight and then they notified the passengers that they had no pilots for the flight. Sat on board with the rest of the unhappy passengers for another hour. I paid more to change to this flight to avoid weather and paid more in change fees that the original flight cost. I could not talk to anyone to make the change. Waited 2 hours in a chat que, to wait another hour and 52 minutes for the rep to make the changes. Never flying this airline again.

### "most unpleasant experience"
Not Verified | I had the most unpleasant experience flying with JetBlue. Our flight was delayed over 7 hrs and had to change two planes. Initial flight time was 9am with that being said I was at the airport at 6 am with my husband and son (23 months). They kept changing our gates and flight didn’t come until 11am and started boarding us at 11:30. Finally we thought we are taking off soon but no apparently there was a safety issue and made us sit in the plane till 1:45 pm. Horrible experience ever. I would never travel with JetBlue again. My son was over tired and irritated made our travel experience exhausting. I also don’t recommend anyone to travel with JetBlue even my family has similar experiences in the past.

### "told me I was not authorized"
My connection to a Turkish Airlines flight was missed because my flight from Raleigh to New York arrived late. Jetblue staff said the hotels are fully booked and they said I can book hotel from my own money and I will be reimbursed up to $236 a night. When I arrived at destination I contacted customer service and asked for the procedure to get my money reimbursed, they told me I was not authorized by supervisor for reimbursement. Moral of the story this airline is a big fraud,.

### "flights have been delayed"
Every single time I've flown Jetblue, my flights have been delayed. I paid $570 for a one way ticket to EWR. This is ridiculous and their excuse is that a flight attendant called in sick.

### "Both times, the flights were delayed"
I've flown with JetBlue twice in my life. Both times, the flights were delayed. The first time, we had to deplane only to board again ten minutes later. I'm currently sitting in LaGuardia waiting to board for my second flight via JetBlue, three hours after we were supposed to have taken off.

### "the worst experience ever"
This was the worst experience ever, I’ll never ride with them again. Charged me 125$ at the gate to bring a bag of food and charged me for a better seat. It was between a baby. Never again, JetBlue you suck.

### "refused to issue me a refund"
This is a terrible airline, they denied me flying with my service animal, cancelled my flight, and then refused to issue me a refund. On top of that their customer service is almost non existent, you have to pay to talk to someone. And then the person was super rude to me, told me they would not issue a refund, and hung up on m. This airline is the worst and a waste of money!! Super unprofessional and they do not adhere to the ADA standards.

### "Never trust a cheap airline"
We were delayed 3 times for over 3 hours until they finally cancelled our flight. They dragged it so late into the evening there were no other flights to get us to LA. JetBlue also could not get us there themselves for several days missing our vacation window entirely. When asked to refund our hotel reservations per their own policies they stated that due to it being cancelled for weather they are not obligated to give us reimbursement. Never trust a cheap airline. It's not worth it they will treat you like a cheap customer. Do the right thing JetBlue.

### "incredibly rude and unhelpful"
I had the Most Miserable experience I have had in 20 years. I booked a flight to San Fran for $1,200. flight time at 5pm didn't board until 9pm get on plane and pilots timed out which means the pilots ran out of time to fly and have to rest. we needed to de-board the plane and the flight was moved to 2am and eventually cancelled. got on another flight that was supposed to leave at 9:30pm we didn’t board until 11pm. at 2am the pilots timed out again. All flights canceled. booked an Uber home to sleep. Still needing to get to San Francisco I booked a flight though "partner" AA for $1,700. Mosaic customer service said it wasn’t their problem and they could not book me on a American Airlines flight, So if i wanted to go i would have to pay the difference. My 2pm flight to JFK landed, we made it to the connecting flight in JFK 20 minutes early, but they closed the gates 10 minutes early making us miss the flight! They re-booked up for a 6:30pm flight and it is now delayed until 9pm! All JetBlue personnel have been incredibly rude and unhelpful, telling me “Too bad". They said that I would get some sort of travel credit but now my business trip and plans are totally destroyed I have also lost my hotel reservations and will be stranded in San Fran at 1am in the morning! The Mosaic Customer care said they might issue some sort of travel bank credit in 7 days if they decide to review the flight. I am distraught at the level of disrespect I have been treated with by all of the JetBlue personnel and the unprofessionalism that has transpired.

### "very unpleasant experience"
I had very unpleasant experience for what was my first and last trip with JetBlue. I booked outbound flights with American and return flights with JetBlue. Little did I know, I had paid a no carry on fee for the latter so upon leaving I learned that I my carry on would not be accepted. I had to spend another $200 on upgraded seats just to take my carry on on two flight segments. I was also met with rude staff at the gate in Fort Lauderdale who seemed annoyed that I was late (due to the prior JetBlue flight being delayed) because they would have to open the jet at again etc. Very rude and unprofessional service. I’ve never been forced to pay more for seats to bring a carry on! I will stick with United, Delta and American for work and pleasure!

### "the little things that matter"
Currently flying home for my best friends funeral and I've flown Jetblue several times but I will not fly with any other airline. It's the little things that matter and the flight attendant on board was one of the nicest people ever and I appreciate the free beer more than I can explain. Says so much, and he shook my hand and genuinely told me I'm sorry for your loss and I know he meant it. Amazing airline and people working for it you got my business for life Jetblue

### "Met my expectations in every way"
Not Verified | Met my expectations in every way. I am not a frequent traveler, but I look for comfort and efficient service. Takeoff and landing were both smooth and we didn't hit any turbulence during our flight. The seat was comfortable, but the button to recline was stuck. Luckily I had a lot of leg room (I'm 5'3") and was comfortable the entire flight. The windows were dirty and there was probably a kid sitting there before me, but I also can't expect the staff to wipe each window between flights. I love that the snacks are free and I fully take advantage by grabbing one of each thing. The staff was quick and efficient with in-flight service, and super friendly each time we interacted. The back of seat tv had a ton of movies and tv shows to choose from and I purchased a set of wired earbuds to watch an old favorite. I was happy with this flight and after taking a different airline back, Jetblue is much better. I purchased through a third party site and I think I got a great deal and had many time options to choose from. Taking away two stars because of the dirty windows and seat that wouldn't recline. Otherwise it met my expectations: I arrived at my destination safely and had a comfortable trip.

### "Every time there is a problem"
Not Verified | Every time I fly Jetblue there is a problem. Today Feb 15,2023 my flight from MCO to BOS has been delayed for smell of oil in the cabin. It never fails that there is a problem with this airline. Stay away from booking on this airline if you can. They have issues with their maintenance, route efficiency and delays of one type of another. This airline needs a total overhaul from top down.

### "Unforgettable terrible experience"
Terrible experience, ground staff terrible flight delayed, we were out standing on a side for 30 minutes for security check without any reason. Airplane staff even worse. Suitcase broken in New York, we wanted to complain but nobody was there in the JetBlue office. We needed to go because needed to catch another flight leaving from Newark. Unforgettable terrible experience.

### "full of incompetent staff"
Horrible staff, delayed. I booked through American Airlines, I am a priority member and JetBlue however doesn’t care to follow the consistent service as described by AA and charged me for my baggage. The service is terrible too full of incompetent staff.

### "They have degraded to Spirit quality"
Not Verified |  I am still upset by the disregard shown when JetBlue changed the destination airport from Boston to Worcester the morning before my return flight. Worcester is 40 miles from my home, with no reasonable public transportation to my home, and a LYFT from there would have been extremely expensive. I had to change to a flight getting in at almost midnight, and couldn't use Public Transportation at that late hour either, incurring another $65 that I could have saved coming in at the original time of 7:30pm. The flight changing was a hassle, taking me 40 minutes to complete. Nowhere on their customer bill of rights is there any mention of what passengers rights are when the airline decides to change you destination to a place 40 miles from your target. They were unsympathetic. Unrelated, I have to say I was also alarmed that the desk personnel did not look at any of the scanned border passes as we boarded. Anyone could have been on that flight. JetBlue was a wonder when it was started. They have degraded to Spirit quality and I won't use them again. I wish I could let them know, but they don't want to hear from their customers.

### "Jetblue is HORRID"
Jetblue is HORRID!. They just stole $700 from us. I had to cancel a flight due to an accident. I spent all day today trying to rebook -- their online form would not accept my info; they charge $25 just to call them; I chatted with someone, got shuttled to a call center in India; and then back to someone else, who -- after 5 or 6 hours of this -- "sweetly" told me that no, I could not rebook. Interminable wait times.. NO ONE told me my ticket was too old to redeem. It should have been relayed to me in the first interaction. Moreover, the website says nothing about it either. When we got our cancellation email, they did not say we had only one year to redeem, just that they would be there when we wanted to use the tickets. After literally 6 HOURS working on this, I found out they were keeping our $700.

### "nothing but rip-off."
Not Verified | I did not get a chance to fly JetBlue. Below is why. I had gotten a credit due to COVID traveling restrictions. It was expiring on 10/20/2022. So, I called customer service for an extension. I was told no more extensions are given but I can book to hold the value of the money and keep changing it and extending or give it a relative. I did just that. Booked 2 tickets to London from JFK for 6/2023. By January, we decided we wanted to go to Caribbeans for family vacay. I call them to make changes. I was flat out denied or I will be charged fee. Their misleading website indicated I can cancel my flight to get travel credit. So, I did. THAT, completely messed me up and my credit had expired, somehow. ~$2000 gone to JetBlue without any service. Nothing but rip-off. Very disappointed.

### "mortified how horrible customer service is"
Not Verified | I am mortified how horrible customer service is. I had to change my flight to an earlier flight and was not told the difference would be forfeited until after I made this purchase. I lost $600 because of their lack of communication.

### "Do not trust what they say at the desks"
They overbooked the flight and looked for a volunteer to take a later flight with a $700 incentive. I accepted and took the later flight out but had to also change airport. Arrived home 5 hours later than was supposed to arrive with the original flight. Was to receive the incentive in travel credit. Never received it. Contacted customer service three times and was told there was nothing they could do. Was even offered a consolation offer of $50 dollars! Do not trust what they say at the desks.

### "Shame on you JetBlue"
JetBlue cancelled our connecting flight from JFK to Tampa and we missed our vacation. They said they could not get us to Florida or even back home for 5days. I was stranded as a single mom with two children in New York City with no where to go for 5 days. Their were no hotels because it was the week of New Years Eve and their were no rental cars that would allow a one way rental home to Missouri. I had saved for this vacation to Florida with my kids for two years. It was ruined but that I could deal with but the lack of accommodation to reimburse me with extra flying points is ridiculous. That is the very least they could do for putting me in a very dangerous situation with my children for five days with no vouchers for hotel or food. It was a terrifying experience. Shame on you JetBlue for not making it right and taking accountability.

### "Customer service is pleasantly abysmal"
Not Verified |  JetBlue Customer Service personnel fabricate information that is not honored when attempting to use travel credits in 2023. Example- flight booked 9/21, cancelled 1/22 with original expiration date of 9/1/22. Called customer service 6/1/22, 8/1/22 and was told not to worry,the Sept expiration date extended to mid-Jan, 2023, call the Intra Dept use tckt. no. when calling. Extensive notes kept of call discussions. Attempting to book a new ticket in escalation to supervisor Valerie of Salt Lake City indicated- she's sorry you were told incorrect information, credits expired on the original date of 9/1/22. No accommodation whatsoever, out $194. Lesson Learned- all Jet Blue communication must be on email or in writing as their discussions are not honored. Customer service is pleasantly abysmal, with a rating of below zero. Confidence in the airline zero. Trust in the business below zero.

### "do not fly JetBlue"
Check in was not smooth, the website kept glitching while i was processing my check in on 12/26/22, also i purchased 4checked bags. On our way to the airport i looked at our tickets and the seats i had purchased for our family of 4 the night before were no longer listed on the ticket. The website was having “server issues” per the customer service operator i spoke with on 12/27/2022 in the morning hours. The agent over the phone advised me she couldn't help over the phone that we would need to speak with an agent at the check in counter. On arrival to the airport we went to the counter and were told to first print our tickets and bag tags at the kiosk and then they could assist. When we checked in at the kiosk it said only 1 bag was processed and that i had to purchase the additional 3. So i did. Finally tickets and bag tags printed. When we arrived at the JetBlue counter i spoke with the agent who was very helpful, she advised me that 7 bags were paid for, she mentioned they had been experiencing issues with the kiosk. We only had 4 bags, we only checked in 4 bags. She said she noted our account and to call JetBlue to get our $135 refunded since we did not have 7bags. We waited an additional hour to figure out the seats, she tried several methods to fix our seats since we were traveling with two little kids (4&5). After several phone calls she was told for us to go ahead and go through TSA that by the time we arrived in Boston for our connection our seats would be taken care of. While she was trying her best to help us, another agent came around and said to her “you’ll be here all day if you keep trying to help them”. To this she answered “sometimes we have to do the right thing”. I give her so much credit for actually trying her best to do her job the right way. They assured us we would be taken care of by the time we arrived in Boston with a final destination to Denver. We continued to our gate and boarded our first flight. On our arrival to Boston for our connecting flight not only dis we still not have seats but they had us and our son on a standby list and my daughter was the only one with a seat! My husband stood at the counter and talked to the agent endlessly until we finally got seats with our children. I would like to note our flights had been booked for 6 months, there was absolutely no reason we were being placed on a standby list. On our return home my husband contacted JetBlue to request a refund for the additional 3 bags we were wrongly charged for. We were advised the charge was non-refundable. Basically they are saying they took our money for 3 bags we didn't check in. If i can give any advise to anyone booking a flight, please save yourself the hassle and do not fly JetBlue.

### "If you can, go on JetBlue2
Not Verified |  One of the best flights I've been on! On our first flight from SFO to FLL the flight was delayed about an hour because it was coming from New York. The gate agent was super friendly and was helping people with a smile. She gave us extra reward miles for the inconvenience. On the plane, there was a self-serve bar with snacks and drinks, and you could take as many as you wanted. On our second flight, the flight attendant was very friendly and even went out of her way to give my son JetBlue wings. The wifi was free and very fast. The legroom was amazing and there were TVs on every seat. If you can, go on JetBlue.

### "Utterly disappointed"
Utterly disappointed. Second time flight is delayed. 3 hour delay and 1 hour taxiing.. Unfortunately called customer service and they were extremely rude and would not give any credit on account, stating the delay was 2 hrs 56 minutes, even though we have proof it was a 3 hr delay. Looks like they like to alter their numbers. We are paying customers and deserve respect. Please retrain your staff and do better as a company. We love JetBlue but the last few times we noticed staff is careless both in the customer service department and the inflight crew.

### "never fly with Jetblue again"
Not Verified | The customer service reps don’t even look at you or make eye contact when you talk to them. The worst encounter I have ever had. Would never fly with Jetblue again. Charged extra for everything and still no guarantee.

### "worst flight experience I’ve ever had"
The worst flight experience I’ve ever had. The cancelled my partner’s flight on the way to New Orleans and couldn’t book him for another 3 days; they wouldn’t even direct him to another airline! Then they cancelled our flight back to New York, so we scheduled for the next day. They then delayed it another hour and a half. Ok, whatever. At the last minute they moved the flight up another 30 minutes, causing us to rush to the gates! Once we got there, they said they weren’t boarding yet! What a waste of time and money, this experience has made me never want to take another flight.

### "been a disappointment"
Jetblue used to be my only choice for flying. For years it was the primary option with having Fly-Fi, Directv, assigned seating, and relatively low rates. But the past 2 times I've flown them have been a disappointment. Our family of 4 was flying from BOS to RSW round trip. In BOS our flight was delayed several times then an additional set of delays until the crew (who would not communicate why we were not boarding the flight) decided to inform everyone that the flight was oversold and would not board until someone volunteered to give up their seat. This happened several times before allowing us to board. In total it was a 5 hour delay from original itinerary. When we arrived in RSW no one brought the strollers and assistive devices to the jetway for at least 15 minutes after the flight was deplaned completely, leaving those who most need their equipment hanging. No one is more patient than a dozen toddlers and infants who just sat in a terminal for 5 hours and then flew 3 more hours. Luckily, it was a moot point as the crew took another hour to get the luggage to the carousel. On the return flight, it was delayed and then canceled the day of with no explanation. Called Jetblue to figure out other options and was told possibly the next day but we wouldn't be able to sit together. This isn't an option as we were flying with a 3 and 4 year old. We offered to drive from RSW to TPA, 2.5 hours a way to get a flight with seats together. That flight was also delayed an hour. When we landed in BOS there was a long taxing delay. We deplaned and no one unloaded the luggage for 2 hours from when we landed. Several of us parents were stuck on the jetway for 45 minutes because you can't pass through the ticketing agent because you aren't able to return through. We asked if anyone was bringing the assistive devices and the ticketing agent had no answer for anyone. After another 30 minutes they found a crew to unload the strollers. In total it was over 2 hours from deplaning to getting our belongings. Jetblue offered me four $50 travel bank credits to make up for the delays on the way and then 4 more on the way home. I signed up for the travel bank and got into it to only see one credit for $50 dollars and not the $400 they said I would receive. Also, their TrueBlue and Mosaic system is flawed and never records my flights. You call to try to get customer service and the wait time is 59 minutes. I think I am done with Jetblue. Also, Jetblue advertises having Fly-Fi and TVs and our entire row of TVs were completely non-functional and the Fly-Fi was out of service area for most of the flight. On the return flight 2 of our seats audio jacks were non functioning and one of our TV controls didn't work at all. In exchange for having zero entertainment options they offered an extra bag of cheese itz.

### "Customer service was horrible"
Customer service was horrible. They made several changes to my route, so I changed the flight to one with a layover that made sense, and came with a $48 credit. However, because I paid for part of the ticket using a credit that has since expired, they said that the $48 credit I received for making this change was expired. The whole ticket was around $590, I paid for about $340 of that with a credit, and the other $250 on a credit card. I tried using JetBlue's chat feature, only to get told multiple times that the credit was expired, and no response when I asked why they were using the expired credit as a measure rather than the $250 new credit card purchase, as the credit I should have received was nowhere close to that amount. And then the customer service rep just ended the chat on me while I was typing a response to her latest 'credit is expired' BS. Part of me wants to pursue it further, but then if they do end up giving me the credit, that means I have to fly JetBlue again, and I don't think it's worth it.

### "delayed 3 times and not canceled till 2am"
Originally at 940pm I had a flight but it was delayed 3 times and not canceled till 2am because they said they could not find a crew and the previous crew timed out. This was a connection I was supposed to make after flying from overseas. I have been at airports and flying for 24 hours. This is outrageous. The help desk does not open till 230.

### "The worst experience of my life"
Not Verified |  The worst experience of my life. As we get to Lima to go to our connecting flight they tell us the flight is so delayed that we won’t make it to our next flight in time. They then give a direct flight from Fort Lauderdale to Boston, which we were happy about, then we realized we will be in the airport for 8 hours, without being fed anything on any of the planes. We tried to change the flight when the help women just said “nope, there isn’t any other flights”. Doesn’t check. Then we get through security and see a flight we could have made for 11:45 instead of 5 pm. We were told we were gonna get a food voucher cause 8 hours without food plus not getting fed on the plane is disgusting. They gave us for lunch and dinner $12 USD. Will never be doing this again, completely ruined my trip and the New Year!

### "6.5 hour delay and counting"
This airline is terrible. After a 6.5 hour delay and counting, I need my medication from my checked bag. I guess since we're so late and they can't get my bad with medication, I will have to suffer. I just want to go home at this point after 8 hours in this airport.

### "would rather I pay for a flight than use miles"
Not Verified | Completely useless. For three days in a row I'm trying to book a flight with miles. Three days getting errors and the specific error is blocked by a pop-up. I'm building a website and I can say that JetBlue's website may as well have been designed by high school students. Doesn't pass the most basic quality tests. I suspect the "error" is that Jetblue would rather I pay for a flight than use miles. Now on hold for 20 minutes. If I were running Jetblue the Chief Technology Officer would be gone with immediate effect.

### "JetBlue really failed me on this trip"
Not Verified |  I’m usually a fan of JetBlue, but they have been terrible today. Was rebooted (with A LOT of effort) from a cancelled non-stop to a route with a stop in FLL. The flight times have fluctuated wildly all day. Even as boarding approaches, they’ve run much later than posted. AND, there have been absolutely no announcements. We’re currently waiting on flight attendants, but say nothing if you don’t ask. JetBlue really failed me on this trip.

### "Completely useless airline"
Not Verified | Worst experience ever. Plane at the gate, crew waiting for the door to open. Waited until departure time to open up boarding and then had no gate when arrived in TPA. No wifi, no tv, no flight monitor. 2 hours late arriving to gate. Completely useless airline

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service I’ve ever experience in an airline that I trusted. I used to rave about how Jetblue what the best. Now, I feel, they are the worst. Grandfather died and we needed to make the trip on Christmas Day (today). They delayed the flight 3 times: we checked every 5 minutes on the status via the JetBlue app and email. All of the sudden, the app said the doors were closing one hour earlier than the last update earlier! We’d gotten some food and when we ran to the terminal the attendants wouldn’t let us on the plane. Customer service desk did nothing to help but put us on the waitlist. We were numbers 2 and 4. We finally get to the gate to the flight leaving 7 hours after our original departure and they moved us down the standby list to numbers 4 and 5. We missed the flight by one seat. The flight attendant checking people’s boarding passes actually gave a seat to a couple with a stroller crib “for their convenience.” Of that haven’t happened, we would’ve made it to my grandfather’s funeral and I would have gotten to see his (his body at least) one last time before they put him in his grave. Because of Jetblue, I did not. I will never forgive them for this.

### "Treat your customers with care and respect"
This Christmas Buffalo NY, where I live, experienced probably the worst snow blizzard in history. My wife was supposed to fly with JetBlue from JFK to Buffalo on Dec 24. Her flight was cancelled, which was not a surprise. JetBlue website and app didn’t work but I managed to rebook using the customer care chat. She was now scheduled to fly from JFK to Rochester at 5:35 pm on Dec. 24. I was hoping to pick her up from there as soon as weather conditions permitted. She showed up at the airport at about 3 pm. After a long wait (crowds of people at the airport) she checked in and made it to the gate. JetBlue delayed the departure at least five times. At one point, the message to the passengers was that the plane had already arrived and only needed to be cleaned. But then … it disappeared. JetBlue must have prioritized another destination and decided to keep the Rochester passengers waiting. At 10:46 pm JetBlue delayed the departure until 12:56 pm. At 12:06 am on Dec 25 the flight was cancelled. After having spent nine hours at the airport my wife had to figure out how to get her luggage back and find a hotel for the night. It was a difficult day for US airlines; no doubt about it. Many flights across the US were cancelled. All the airlines faced major weather-related difficulties over Christmas. That is true. But my son was travelling with United at the same time. His flight was also cancelled, and he had to rebook it twice. But he could easily do this using the United app, the airport staff was available and helpful, and most importantly United got him to Rochester on Dec 24. United, in the face of crises, proved to be a much better airline than JetBlue. At the same time: - JetBlue seems to have had no idea where their planes were - There was no JetBlue staff at the airport to attend distressed passengers - JetBlue website was down - JetBlue app did not work - The wait time for the customer care chat was an hour - Customer care chat had no idea where the luggage was and advised to talk to the airport staff, that was nowhere to be found - The luggage return was a mess with suitcases damaged and piling up. My wife is not a young and strong person. After having spent nine hours at JFK terminal 5, which is now a comfortable place to be, her physical and mental state were terrible. JetBlue provided no assistance. The airline refunded the ticket. But it is not enough. JetBlue put my wife’s health in danger and showed no care. Treat your customers with care and respect that they deserve.

### "Worst airline experience ever"
JetBlue cancelled our flight at the gate, minutes after we were supposed to take off. No explanation was given, and the abundant personnel at the airport were clueless, rude, and condescending. Their remote "customer service" was even worse. They took over 6 hours to get me to a chat. The clueless staff at the other end would take over 10 minutes responding to my chat message. But when I waited 10 seconds to respond to the chat, it dropped me off. Worst airline experience ever.

### "JetBlue communicated terribly"
JetBlue is a very disorganized airline. Our plane was canceled while we were waiting for it at the airport. Jet Blue handed the cancelation miserably. Initially they told us to wait a minute while they looked for a hotel for us. After 4 hours of numerous wait "one minute" comments, they told us we were all set. A Jet Blue employee helped us through customs and so on, then left us outside the airport without a hotel. We went back to the ticket counter, and they told us they couldn’t help us despite acknowledging that our plane had been canceled. They told us another airline also had flights just canceled (after ours) and that airline had booked all the hotel rooms. I’ve been on many airlines and have had numerous cancelations. All other airlines handled the cancelation reasonably well. Yes, sometimes I had to wait hours, but the other airlines were always polite and communicated clearly. JetBlue communicated terribly and left us in a foreign country at the airport curbside with nowhere to say. We were able to book a place to stay, but the cost was on us and had the headaches of figuring out how to do that when we didn’t speak the language. I wish I was on the American Airlines that had their flight canceled hours after us as I believe American picked up the tab for the hotel and helped the travers get to the hotel. Stay away from Jet Blue.

### "extremely disappointed in JetBlue"
Jetblue use to be a great airline, however, they’ve clearly decided to put money over customers. Tacking on fees here and there for everything as if this was a spirit or frontier flight. They have great seating on the planes and great inflight entertainment but these new tickets and extra fees for bags is ridiculous. They say they’re giving you options, but is this really options or Just another way to beef up their pockets. My flight was delayed over two hours and the customer service representative refused to do anything to try and make it right. I’m extremely disappointed in JetBlue and I will think twice about booking a B6 flight in the future.

### "horrible customer service"
Absolutely horrible customer service. Was deliberately ignored while asking for help with my boarding pass refusing to load. Double charged my card TWICE. Leaving me without enough money to fully enjoy my travels. Each and every flight is delayed 2-3 hours due to “maintenance” 0/10 would NOT RECOMMEND.

### "very unprofessional and unrespectful"
I fly with my mother on December 14th to Aruba from New York JFK. The flight was at 7 am. We did the check in on the machines and when going to drop the luggages on the luggage drop, the guy in charge was beyond rude to both of us. First, we asked him help on how to put the luggage tag, to what he replied:” its not my problem if you don't know how to read the instructions”, which was not the case, we just were confused, in a rush, and trying to get it right faster. After that he asked us for the ED CARD, when asking him what that was, he replied “you will not be flying to Aruba today” . I then asked him if this was something we could complete right away at the airport before taking the flight, and he just replied “get out of the line”. Now, I understand we were not well prepared but this positions require good customer service and every single passenger deserves some human dignity and respect. It is very unprofessional and unrespectful to give this kind of answers to customers. We did mange to get all done and fly but the treatment was completely unnecessary.

### "was more than an hour delayed"
Worse experience ever whenever possible I will always try to avoid Jetblue. First, just to check in my bag me and my daughter waited outside on line forever as staff was slow, inefficient and limited and it was soo freezing that we ended up with a cold. The inside machines were not working. Then I am TSA pre but somehow it did not appear on my ticket so I did the regular line and let me tell you, OMG I have never seen in my life a line like this. Literally a snake line that was barely moving and so long that it was impossible not to lose mine and others flight. The hysterical thing is that TSA pre line was barely anything and even worse is that there were lots of check in kiosk that were not operative, so basically Jetblue was completely understaffed. Moral is that most of the people in line lost their flight so to make your flight happen you had to be at the airport at least 4 hours before the departure hour, this just because Jetblue is the most unorganized company ever. Also there were few poor old men that were extremely tired of waiting and not able to stand so long, most kept trying to skip the lines but we were all late no matter what flight it was. Oh and I made it to get my flight just because Jetblue was more than an hour delayed good for me but come on there is not one right thing about Jetblue. Great job Jetblue for being the worse flying company ever.

### "employees are unbelievably rude"
JetBlue employees are unbelievably rude and fall on the border of harassment. I have never experienced such a poor experience with their employees at JFK airport check-in desk. Essentially, I wasn’t allowed to board my flight and had no guarantee of a refund after denying my service animal (when I had all the paperwork / registered him prior). They gave me no legitimate reason for why we wouldn’t be let on the plane other than it was “against guidelines”. I experienced yelling, screaming, and child-like mocking from their hot-heated employees and have never experienced anything like it from any airline. It almost seemed like they had a prior stigma about me before even speaking to them. For the love of god, please save your time, energy and money from Jet Blue. JetBlue - you need to seriously think about who you’re hiring or restructure your customer service employees. I will never fly this airline again. Truly put a damper on my holiday plans!

### "unacceptable customer service"
Flight was delayed from the beginning. No reason announced. Landed 45 min late. It was raining. Another 10 min wait to open the door. I told the crew I am going to miss my connection flight. I had 2 hrs in between. No reaction. They did nothing. After leaving a plane I couldn’t enter the customs area for 20 min. I was told there is no space. While a couple who had global entry was allowed to enter customs with no issue. I had to pick up my luggage and check it in again, but was told that my next plane left. I was told to walk with a suitcase to next terminal in rain to get to JetBlue desk. The JetBlue crew showed zero empathy. They refused to look for another flight and said next jetblue is in the morning forcing me to take overnight hotel. They gave me a hotel that had no shuttle in the morning to get back to the airport. Hotel told me I have to call a taxi and the file for reimbursement. I spent 4 hours on all of it. Each time when calling jetblue waiting 15 min on hold to even speak to an agent. I am totally confused and lost any desire to travel anywhere. This is totally unacceptable customer service. No support if something happens. Slow response. They don’t care.

### "JetBlue was absolutely terrible to fly with"
Not Verified |  Both ways, JetBlue was absolutely terrible to fly with. I was not allowed to board my departure flight because the flight was to leave at 7:20 and we arrived at 6:00am. We may have been able to board if we weren’t told by a random employee at the line to fill out ED cards (4 forms for each family member, 2 of them minors - a three year old and a 2 year old). We had to go all the way on the other side of the terminal to reschedule our flight. Anyone would be upset in this situation and instead of “we apologize for the inconvenience. Security checks are a long process here,” I get, “your itinerary says you need to be here 3 hours in advance (booked through Expedia, and it did not). Listen to what I’m saying instead of this temper tantrum you’re throwing right now.” Imagine that with 2 little children. On top of that, ED cards weren’t even verified. They had the previous flight number on them so basically, they are just a waste of time. My husband had an expired green card and a letter from the USCIS saying he could travel. It took 15 mins + to verify that this letter was acceptable (meanwhile in Aruba, there was no issue). Boarding passes were printed with no seats for my family so when it was boarding time, the representative at the gate was left searching for seats. I was worried we weren’t going to be able to board. I was then told that I needed to do this from home to make it easier. Well, I tried to check-in from home but, there is no option to enter a green card number at home. Thank goodness I didn’t have to reschedule my flight again. All I can say is, JetBlue you need to make life easier. I hope you learn from this review and get your act together because you really have a bad rap for a reason.

### "They cancelled last minute"
Jet Blue emailed us 5 times saying our flight had been delayed until, finally, they cancelled the flight which originally was supposed to leave at 11:30pm. They cancelled last minute and they didn’t have any other flights available that we could use. We had hotel reservations that had to be postponed last minute, we lost money on Broadway tickets that we couldn’t attend and I had to pay a lot more for a last minute ticket from another airline. Jet Blue refused to give us any kind of compensation, it’s the worst airline I have ever had any contact with. Will not buy any tickets from them again.

### "had us removed for abusing him"
What a fall Jetblue has taken. My pregnant wife & I were removed from a flight because we would not accept a terrible flight attendant's rude & inappropriate behavior. Jetblue refused to compensate us, even according to their own published standards, as we were delayed overnight & nearly 12 hours. Shame on this once terrific company. A flight attendant basically yelled at me & incorrectly told me I had to place my paid for carry-on item at my feet, as a personal item. Then he refused to move aside & allow my pregnant wife to sit down. Then as mentioned above, he had us removed for abusing him.

### "Will not be flying with JetBlue again"
Not Verified |  Every time I have flown with JetBlue it has been delayed significantly (most recent 3+hours with 3 gate changes) and the communication about changes with boarding times/gates etc has been substandard. Crew not empathetic about these issues. Will not be flying with JetBlue again.

### "I was really impressed"
Excellent experience! I was really impressed. Great leg room which is very important as I am 6.3. Very good service and they paid attention to the extra details. Full onboard entertainment with movies, etc, several charging stations at each seat and free, fast Wi-Fi. Altogether I will try to choose JetBlue in the future if possible.

### "It was a terrible experience"
Today, November 17, 2022, at 6.30 am in SJU the JetBlue check-in process was terrible and out of control - something a lady verifying your checked luggage tags keeps blaming the issue to shortage of personnel. The self-check-in machines were only printing 1 checked luggage tag. Therefore, if you couldn't get the machine to print a second tag, you had to go a make an overcrowded line at the counter. I think it would have been easier for them to put 1 staff to help customers with the printing of tags in the machines. I have never seen JetBlue at SJU operating so poorly. Only the individual that was taking the checked luggage showed a good customer services out the few others that were there. It was a terrible experience.

### "they went real down hill"
Our initial departure time was pushed back 4 hours. Meaning we missed our 3 hour layover in Florida. Our next flight was not available until 2 days later. We finally make it. Now on our way back the plane is delayed an hour and a half because the plane “was too heavy,” everything is weighed out before you fill the plane so I’m assuming they lied. So on the way back we run to the boarding gate and the lady at the counter closes the doors and says she can’t open them. We could see the plane still docked. So we had to go back to the counter and they tried putting us on a flight a day later. We cancelled and are awaiting our refund which they should. They cost us 2 days of vacation and money to fly a different airline. I used to love JetBlue enough to even own stock, not anymore, they went real down hill.

### "Use to be a good airline"
Not Verified |  TV’s did not work. Charged for baggage that was not told at booking. Only when got to airport. Canceled connecting flight so had to spend 9 hours overnight at JFK. Would not change my flight to Boston or put me on another airline. Staff at desk were very rude. Use to be a good airline. Never again will I fly with Jet Blue. Maybe when the old owner gets his new airline off the ground it will be run like the old JET BLUE people need to wake up stop in allowing this poor service

### "horrifying, traumatic experience"
Worst airport experience ever! We flew out of Logan Airport in Boston on JetBlue. Needed to check in with customer service the agent took my passport card and helped us through the process. We boarded our flight only to arrive in Aruba to find out they do not accept passport cards only passport books. I take some responsibility for not doing my due diligence but I also feel the JetBlue associate should of been also aware since they routinely fly out of Boston to Aruba. When I got to Aruba after waiting in the customs line forever. The customs agent/ Airport employee lost his mind and caused a scene regarding my US passport card. Then the nightmare began the treated us like we were international drug dealers. Treated rudely and presented a hostile environment. We are 2 middle age women in a foreign country we were scared and shaken. No one cared they separated us and did not allow us to see each other. They then "perp" walked us through the airport through 3 security check points to put us back on a full plane of angry passengers that were required to wait for us. What a horrifying, traumatic experience.

### "customer service has not been helpful"
Not Verified |  I had an original flight during Covid. Was forced to get a credit that I tried to use April 2022. Flight was cancelled due to no pilots/crew. Was forced to get another credit. Tried again in Sept 2022. Flying from Jax connecting in LaGuardia with final destination Denver. Sat on plane for more than 2 1/2 hours for mechanical issues and couldn't make my connection. I got off the plane to find another airline to get to Denver. At this point customer service has not been helpful after multiple attempts. Jetblue has more than $500 of my money since 2019.

### "never experienced such terrible service"
Terrible airline. I have been flying my whole life. Mom worked for TWA, daughter for American. I have never experienced such terrible service. Do not waste your money on this low-budget airline. JetBlue is bottom of the barrel! Fly a different airline! Photo attached - no one anywhere to help. The flight was just as bad. Garbage Airline.

### "My first and last time I'll ride with JetBlue"
Not Verified |  My first and last time I'll ride with JetBlue. I'll rather pay a little more than fly with JetBlue. They already delayed my flight two times without notifying their customers. It's totally wasting my precious time so if you're okay with waiting 4-5 hours in the airport just to ride JetBlue, go for it. However, do not if you don't like to waste your time waiting for a flight that is uncertain about their flight schedule. Do your job JetBlue!

### "Worst experience this time"
Worst experience this time. Bought ticket with my wife but airline decide do not going together because I didn't go to counter. So what is the purpose to check in online also at the airport check in yourself I didn't have any bags to check. It is not the first time. I will consider different company next time.

### "flight attendant was quite rude"
Not Verified |  Just flew from Boston to New York last night. The flight overall was great but there was one flight attendant who was quite rude. I had purchased a hot coffee and a small bottle of Baileys for an extra $10 and I wanted to take my time drinking it. The flight attendant came by only after 10 minutes to take trash and insisted that I throw my coffee out. I found it extremely weird because I’ve been flying for years and never had someone wait there until I threw out my drink. I told her I was still working on it and she still persisted that we were going to be landing soon. I burned my mouth trying to chug down hot coffee and threw out half a cup still full. I know it wasn’t a long flight but you should let people finish what they pay for.

### "great with your customers"
Not Verified |  Well coming here was horrible, delayed for hours while sitting on the plane. Now as we return Kai helped me fix my tickets, and he made it so pleasant. JetBlue, take care of Kai, he is great with your customers!
