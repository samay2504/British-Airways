### "had a very bad experience with Interjet"
Not Verified |  Me and my family had a very bad experience with Interjet. We were going to fly to Mexico but the airline did not let us. They changed our flight and later they also said they were not flying anymore and gave us a voucher to fly in the future. Up until today we have not being able to fly and have been like this for almost a year. The worst part is that once the voucher expires, we will lose our money, Interjet will not be responsible for giving us an extension and they will keep our money.

### "This is stressful and very unprofessional"
Not Verified |  Our family of 7 had a trip to Cancun for June 2020 with Interjet. I was able to get vouchers that we still aren't able to use! They don't answer phone calls, no phone number is working for us, not even the one in Mexico. We have tried booking online but it doesn't allow us to, don't know what to do anymore. This is stressful and very unprofessional. Today I found their email and sent them one, I really hope we don't lose our money, this is unfair.

### "forced me to take a credit"
Waiting 7 months for my refund. I asked them to move my flight and they tried to charge me an extra 200 USD for a cheaper flight. They never changed my flight and forced me to take a credit. Still waiting for my refund, they do not respond to your emails, I have emailed them every week for 7 months now you do the math. They do not respond.

### "routes and schedules became lesser and lesser"
We were supposed to fly to Mexico City, then to Acapulco. Due to the travel restrictions between both countries, we had to keep postponing our vacation. We kept postponing until we were finally decided to go. By then, Interjet's routes and schedules became lesser and lesser. It will take 2 extra stops just to get to Mexico City, that is normally about a 3.5 hour flight. And also, there's no more flights to Acapulco. Through Expedia, and I don't know how Expedia found out that Interjet don't refund. And also, all Interjet's 1-800 toll free numbers no longer work.

### "impossible to communicate with interjet"
It is absolutely impossible to have an answer to our questions. Have been left in the void. Our flights have been scheduled on July 20, 2020. I am trying to communicate with e dream who eyx sends me a letter saying that the company concerned was in procedure or to worry that I would receive an email with the voucher. We are in November I have not received anything. And impossible to communicate with interjet. C'est absolument impossible d avoir une reponse a nos questions. Ont est laisse dans le néant. Nos vols ont ete cencellé ke 20 juillet 2020. J'essaie de communiquer avec *e dream* qui eyx m envoie une lettre disant que la compagnie interjet était en pricedure dene oas m inquièter que je recevrais un mail avec le * voucher* . Nous sommes en novembre je n ai rien reçu. Et impossible  communiquer avec interjet.

### "has been the worst airline to respond to the COVID 19 pandemic"
Not Verified |  Interjet has been the worst airline to respond to the COVID 19 pandemic. They lack transparency, communication, and the very restrictive voucher process does nothing to help or alleviate any customer concern. I would never recommend this airline to anyone. I will never even consider flying Interjet again! They have lost a customer. My family of 5 have lost thousands of dollars that we will probably never recuperate because they do not answer their phones or reply to email. Do not fly with them. You can tell a lot how companies value their customers and this company does not with how they have managed their response to COVID.

### "Give a voucher but impossible to book another flight"
Not Verified |  Give a voucher but impossible to book another flight with them, they don't fly anymore and they don't even pick up the phone. Basically you can be sure to loose your money. My flight was cancelled because of Covid, they gave me a voucher but the expiration date of the voucher was only 4 months after the date of the flight and they don't offer any flights anymore so it's an unusable voucher. I tried so many times to call them, they never pick-up the phone. I did not have this problem with other airlines, for example I was able to exchange my flight for a voucher without an expiration date with Air Canada just in writing my booking number even though I did not even buy my flight on their website but on flighthub. Apparently even for the employees of flighthub it's impossible for them to reach the airline to fix the problem. It's such a rip off, you are not allowed to give a voucher with a stupid expiration date if you don't even offer a possible replacement service before the expiration date.

### "this airline should now be avoided at all costs"
Not Verified |  Interjet was fine prior to Covid-19, but this airline should now be avoided at all costs. The airline has been issuing vouchers for future travel, but with a very restrictive timeframe (must be flown by June 30, 2021) and vouchers must be redeemed before October 30, or they expire. Interjet has suspended all international flights since March, but continued selling non-refundable flights for international destinations on its website well into the summer of 2020. That should be illegal! I bought a flight from Mexico City to Havana in May, 2020 on the assumption that the airline had resumed international service, and was informed only 3 days before that the flight had been cancelled. I have some other Interjet vouchers as well, but Interjet is currently flying a few routes within Mexico, and that's it. Interjet is screwing over its passengers with this unrealistic timeline to use the voucher with very limited options within Mexico only.

### "One of the worst airlines"
I and my wife, the first time I was going to fly ever. I had flights booked from Cancun to Havana via Interjet website. Interjet cancelled our flights because of COVID-19. They did not send a voucher or any information e-mail. I have been calling Interjet all week from Turkey and no answer at all. One of the worst airlines ever I have seen

### "the flight was cancelled"
This was the first time I was going to fly ever. I bought tickets for my boyfriend and I to see my dying grandmother one last time and I wasn't ever informed that my flight was changed at first, then cancelled! My boyfriend and I were at the airport waiting for the plane before asking someone why Interjet wasn't coming up on the screen. after being told there were not Interjet flights I called Interjet and they confirmed that the flight was cancelled. I was shocked and had to scramble to get home and figure out what to do. Both my boyfriend and I have been calling multiple times daily and at first I got an answer, now it sounds like they have the phone off the hook! I've been waiting for a response to emails and calls. Never ever going though them or recommending ever!

### "been calling Interjet all week"
My trip is scheduled for 9/7 and the airline sent me a schedule change for a date that passed months ago 5/25/20, I got the email of the change on 8/25/20. I originally booked this flight with Priceline but due to Covid I ended up having to make adjustments directly with the airline Interjet. I called Priceline to see if they could help me with the email received from Interjet and they informed me my flight was canceled but I would need to work directly with Interjet as they are not able to help me. I have been calling Interjet all week and no answer at all. I am stuck!

### "voucher isn't even valid for a year"
Awful - I had flights booked from London to Mexico City with BA at the end of June, then flights the next day from Mexico City to Havana. BA cancelled my flights to Mexico and I was able to obtain a full refund. Interjet cancelled my flights to Havana and the first I heard of it was an email saying "We have a voucher for you". The voucher isn't even valid for a year from my cancelled flight, and there is no way I can use it as I can't get to Mexico from London again before expiry. I explained this to two different Interjet agents via email and asked for either an extension of the voucher to two years so that I can actually use it, or a refund of the cost of my cancelled flight. I was told the voucher is already generous and they didn't have to do anything because Covid-19 is out of their control. My bank also tried to obtain the refund and was told it was rejected by Interjet (really helpful). I now have a claim open with my travel insurance film. I never managed to fly with Interjet and now there's no chance I ever will.

### "policy is to give credits that expire"
Interjet cancelled on me due to Covid. Client assistant said on phone they will refund me to my credit card. Email came asking for my bank account number as they could not refund credit card. Another email came saying that their new policy is to give me credits that expire. I am from Singapore. I do not go to Mexico and USA once every 3 months for a vacation. Rosa from the client service team is not helpful at all.

### "they don’t do refunds"
Not Verified | I called a month ago about our flights being cancelled. Was told to call back no later then July 1st to change flight dates at no cost. Called back that date and they told me I had to pay $2150 More then what I already paid. Asked agent to speak with a supervisor and she refuse to let me talk on one for about 30 minutes stating that my call wasn’t important enough for that. Finally talked to supervisor and told me that i still needed to pay and that they don’t do refunds so if I want to use my already paid tickets I need to pay evermore then the original tickets. Do not recommend anyone buying from them.

### "this company is not reliable"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight for June 23, 2020 for me, my wife and my son with Interjet in September 2019 via Expedia. Throughout the covid crisis I checked with Expedia if the flight was still valid and I was answered in the affirmative. On June 20, 2020 I called Interjet and I was informed for the first time that the flight was canceled by them and I was suggested to contact Expedia for the terms of cancellation and compensation However after verification, no message from the cancellation was not sent to me by Expedia or Interjet. So as far as I'm concerned, I still haven't been notified in writing. If I cancel my Expedia flight on my own I advise that I will have a credit valid only until March 31, 2019 with no option to transfer the passenger's name. I am always ready to travel and I dispute that Interjet deprives me of my right to travel and only offers me credit with the most restrictive conditions. I therefore contest the actions of Interjet and claim my right to receive the service for which I paid a high price. Personally I believe that this company is not reliable, solid, credible and all it wants is to appropriate the funds without delivering the goods. I have my doubts about its viability after the crisis. J’ai reserve un vol pour le 23 juin 2020 pour moi, mon épouse et mon fils avec Interjet en Septembre 2019 via l’agence Expedia. Tout au long de la cries du covid j’ai verifie auprès de Expedia si le vol etait toujours valide et on me répondait par l’affirmative. Le 20 juin 2020 j ai appelé Interjet et on m’ a signifié pour la première fois que le vol était annulé par eux et on m’a suggéré de contacter Expédia pour les modalités d’annulation et les indemnités Cependant après vérification, aucun message d’annulation ne m’a été envoyé ni par Expédia ni par Interjet. Donc en ce qui me concerne je n’ai toujours pas été avisé par écrit. Si j’annule par moi -meme mon vol Expedia j’avise que j’aurais un crédit valable seulement jusqu’au 31 mars 2019 sans option de transférer le nom du passager. Je suis toujours prêt à voyager et je conteste que la société Interjet me prive de mon droit de voyager et m’offre uniquement un crédit avec des conditions des plus restrictives. Je conteste donc les gestes de Interjet et réclame mon droit de recevoir la prestation pour laquelle j’ai payé un fort prix. Personellement je crois que cette société n’est pas fiable, solide, crédible et tout ce qu’elle veut est de s’approprier les fonds sans livrer la marchandise. J’ai mes doutes sur sa viabilité après la crise.

### "airline can’t be trusted"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever! Save your money and fly with another airline or completely lose your money with InterJet. I have a Cancun trip for July, InterJet changed my return time before COVID19 then again in April and then again today June 15th. They won’t issue a refund (Insurance was purchased). I should’ve done my research before booking, found out that the airline is close to being bankrupt. After speaking to Expedia which by the way say they can’t do anything, the airline wants to issue a voucher. The airline can’t be trusted!

### "denied our request to process a refund"
Chicago to Oaxaca via Mexico City. My fiance and family had booked a flight (with trip insurance) for our wedding which was going to happen in Mexico. We showed up at the airport ready to go and they told us the flight was cancelled. We didn't receive any phone calls, emails, or texts about the flight being cancelled but just the airport told us when we got there. The next day we were on the phone arguing for about 2 hours and then we were told we would receive a full refund in 8-10 weeks for the cancelled flight. Now we received an email that Interjet denied our request to process a refund for the "non-refundable ticket(s) since it does not meet the current refund exception policy. I am just frustrated by the lack of communication with the cancelled flight, the back and forth conflicting information regarding the refund, the useless trip insurance, and paying over $1500 USD to Interjet for doing absolutely nothing.

### "Terrible business practices"
Not Verified |  My flight was supposed to be June 1st. Due to COVID-19, Lima has closed their borders as well as the airport we were supposed to land in. Interjet refused to refund money or cancel the non-existent flight, so that they will be off the hook for any financial compensation. Their actions are illegal and repeated attempts to speak with their agents have been completely useless. They insisted that flights will be running as usual. Terrible business practices, completely criminal the way they are hoarding money in a global pandemic.

### "Absolutely horrendous"
Vancouver to Lima via Mexico City. Absolutely horrendous. Cannot physically fly to Lima due to the lockdown from Covid-19, and I was given expirable credits that I cannot physically use to book flights due to the lockdown. Customer Service department told me that this was best option they could give us, when it is just a rip off. Since we can't even use it if we wanted to. So my flight is nonexistent, and so is my money.

### "This airline is the worst"
This airline is the worst I have ever used and I will never be flying with them again because of how I have been treated during Coronavirus. I have been on hold with them for 5 hours in sum total, simply trying to talk to someone to find out what my options are. I have a flight with them for May 27th that has not been canceled, despite the fact that Viva Aerobus cancelled my flight from New York to Mexico because they care about their customers. Viva got back to me in all of 5 minutes and refunded my flight. Again, I will not even be in Mexico and have been told a refund is not an option, but no one will give me more information. Again, never use Interjet! When I finally got through, no one said anything on the line and they hung up on me. After an hour on hold. They will never be getting another peso of my money, and they shouldn’t get yours either.

### "One of the worst airlines ever!"
New York to Cancún via Mexico City. One of the worst airlines ever! Save yourself some trouble by not booking with this flight. My family and I were supposed to fly to Cancun this month (May 21st), but because of COVID-19 we can't. We called in March (when it first broke out) asking for a refund because of the unprecendented circumstances and Interjet refused, saying that "the pandemic isn't that serious". I was shocked and horrified. Then, in April, we got an email saying that our flight time got changed. But because I booked a connection-flight, it was physically impossible for me to make it to the connecting flight. I've been calling Interjet ever since and it's now May 4th. I would wait an hour+ on the phone while being put on hold. Someone would pick up, not say anything and just hang up. This happened multiple times. Worst customer service I've ever experiences. I know that they just want my money and don't want to give me a refund.

### "I highly regret it"
This is by far the worst decision I’ve ever made in terms of booking, and I highly regret it. With COVID-19 going on, they had 0 sympathy in giving back credit for a flight that we didn’t cancel on our own. Our only option was to change our flight and keep them as our airline. When trying to book another flight with them, the only available options were for me to make it to my destination a day later than our rescheduled event (my sister’s wedding), same for my return flight. I even tried to book flights a day early, and a day later just to make up for messes up flight schedule, and still had to pay a rebooking fee. A complete waste of an airline. Save your money please and book with a well known airline. Esta es, con mucho, la peor decisión que he tomado en términos de reserva, y lamento mucho. Con COVID-19 en marcha, tenían 0 simpatías al devolver el crédito por un vuelo que no cancelamos por nuestra cuenta. Nuestra única opción era cambiar nuestro vuelo y mantenerlos como nuestra aerolínea. Al intentar reservar otro vuelo con ellos, las únicas opciones disponibles eran que llegara a mi destino un día después de nuestro evento reprogramado (la boda de mi hermana), lo mismo para mi vuelo de regreso. Incluso intenté reservar vuelos un día antes, y un día después solo para compensar los horarios de vuelos desordenados, y todavía tuve que pagar una tarifa de cambio de reserva. Un desperdicio completo de una aerolínea. Ahorre su dinero por favor y reserve con una aerolínea conocida.

### "Do not buy with this airline"
Not Verified |  Do not buy with this airline, it is the worst. My flight was this month but I wanted to cancel it due to the pandemic (corona virus) call wait more than 59 minutes I was hung up more than once and again to call the same way they answered me and left me on line waiting since I am waiting two hours and nothing. This airline does not want to return the money for cancellation without counting that you buy flight insurance. I want to change the date and they have not made it easy for you to have to wait, they hang you up and again they leave you in line waiting. Do not buy here. No compren es esta aerolínea , es lo peor . Mi vuelo era este mes pero lo quería cancelar por la pandemia (corona virus) llame espere más de 59 minutos me colgaron más de una vez y otra vez a llamar igual me contestaban y me dejaron en línea esperando ya voy dos horas esperando y nada . Esta aerolínea no quiere devolver el dinero por cancelación sin contar que compre aseguranza de vuelo . Quiero cambiar la fecha y no te la hasen fácil te hasen esperar , te cuelgan y otra vez te dejan en línea esperando . No compren con aqui

### "vouchers have expiration dates"
I purchased 6 tickets in January for a trip in July. In April, I received an email from the airline basically saying they cancelled our tickets and here are your vouchers. When I called to find out what happened as I never cancelled the flights, the airline took it upon themselves to cancel us from the flight that is still available because it went from nonstop to one stop. But the flight is still available we were just taken off of it? When I asked for a refund they refused according to their policy however I’m not choosing to cancel the flight. They took us off a still existing flight without any prior communication or other options. Also the vouchers they gave us have expiration dates so now we have to travel with restrictions that benefit the airline. I spoke to multiple people and all they could say was to rebook the flight using the voucher. So why take us off the flight in the first place? They do nothing to help their customers not even under the circumstances we’re in. If you’re going to issue us a voucher for a flight you took us off, the least they could do is not put an expiration date on it.

### "Interjet denied our request"
My fiance and family had booked a flight (with trip insurance) for our wedding which was going to happen in Mexico. We showed up at the airport ready to go and they told us the flight was cancelled. We didn't receive any phone calls, emails, or texts about the flight being cancelled but just the airport told us when we got there. The next day we were on the phone arguing for about 2 hours and then we were told we would receive a full refund in 8-10 weeks for the cancelled flight. Just yesterday we received an email that Interjet denied our request to process a refund for the "non-refundable ticket(s) since it does not meet the current refund exception policy. I am just frustrated by the lack of communication with the cancelled flight, the back and forth conflicting information regarding the refund, the useless trip insurance, and paying over $1500 to Interjet for doing absolutely nothing.

### "not wanting to be more flexible"
Not Verified |  I have made several attempts to speak with someone but all attempts have failed. Finally today, April 25, 2020 I was able to speak with an agent from Expedia. Unfortunately after spending over an hour with her and then escalating to a supervisor there was still no consideration for the current circumstances. On I purchased two airline tickets for my daughter and son in law. Flight 3971 was to depart on 05/15/2020 at 2:55pm from Dallas arriving in Mexico City (Flight 2466) at 5:35, leaving at 7:50pm to our final destination Puerto Vallarta arriving at 9:15. Their returning flight 2463 was scheduled to leave Puerto Vallarta on 05/19/2020 at 1:10pm, arriving in Mexico City at 2:45. Leaving Mexico City on flight 3972 at 6:35pm arriving back in Dallas at 9:15pm. I must add that I purchased insurance for these tickets however cannot speak with anyone with that group neither. As we are all aware due to the Covid-19 situation there are things that are out of everyone’s control. On Friday, April 24, 2020 Expedia-Interjet emailed me to advise that they were changing the details to the original flight dates. They gave us no choices besides 1 and it was take it or leave it. Please note not only were the times of the flights changed which is no biggie but the dates are way off in comparison to our original dates WE purchased. Please note that my daughter and son in law needed to return specifically on May 19, 2020 as they have 2 small children and can not be away from them additional days aside the 4 originally planned. Interjet is now wanting them to return 2 days later with no other options. The return date is not an option. I called Expedia today and they advised that they are not able to issue a refund. I then asked for a credit and they were willing to do so. However they want to issue the credit in my daughter and son in laws name. I explained that I paid for the tickets and wanted the credit in my name as I travel more. Bottom line that I paid for them and they are able to see this. The supervisor from Expedia then called Interjet and asked for an exception. Reminder that Interject changed my plans, not me. The manager at Interjet said that they could not issue a refund but he would be willing to issues the credits in my name for a fee of $118.00 each ticket. Yes that’s right! Interjet will not give me a refund for a flight they changed. Interjet will however give me credit for an additional fee even though they initiated the change. I believe my request is reasonable. I’d like a refund but if it’s not an option why not give the person credit who paid for the tickets. The supervisor recommended that I do a chargeback with my bank however this is not a fraudulent situation nor am I disputing the charge. I’m asking for the 2 credits to be issued in my name as my daughter and son in law will not be able to travel those dates nor use a voucher in the next 12 months. It’s so hard to wrap my mind around the thought of the airline not wanting to be more flexible in times like this. Our condo was canceled and most business are closed in Puerto Vallarta. There is no reason to travel there now was it’s unsafe and too soon to expect everything is ‘normal’.

### "does deserve its bad publicity"
While there is a tendency to criticize airlines, Interjet really does deserve its bad publicity. Despite several flights being delayed, cancelled, and the delayed again (after rebooking the cancelled flight), I was out $800 because Interjet chose not to pay its personnel (which caused the delays and cancellations). When I ended up having to stay overnight in Mexico City due to the canceled flight, I was not offered a hotel room, transportation to or from the airport, access to emails/phone calls, food vouchers, or the option of flying on an earlier flight by Interjet. Further, after checking in 2 bags in Houston, the staff at the counter said that I needed to check-in my carry-on because it was over 10kgs. By this time, the staff had already put my bags on the conveyor belt, so I could not re-arrange the weights or pay extra on one of the already checked-in bags. As soon as I arrived back in Houston, I filed a claim with Interjet. For the last 8 months, no-one contacted me via email or post to let me know that I would be offered a one-way ticket (worth $200) for the inconvenience I experienced. When attempting to call them, I was often times put on hold for up to 2 hours. When I did finally reach someone to dispute the $200 offered, I was told the issue would be escalated and that I should call back later. When I asked to speak with a manager, they said "it was not possible. It should be noted the $200 one-way ticket offer would expired within 6 months. Here is the company's terms and conditions (posted online), which they completely ignored: "Offer, with all means available, substitute transportation on the first available flight, and provide, at least and without charge, a telephone or cabled service to communicate with the point of destination; foods in accordance with the waiting time until boarding another flight; overnight accommodation in an airport or city hotel, when required and, in the latter case, ground transportation to and from the airport. Due to the poor customer service, nickel- and-diming, and business stability, I highly recommend you avoid this airline all-together. Take Southwest Airlines if you can.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified | Montreal to Cancun. It was my first time booking with this airline. The plane was nice and the service on board was ok. During my trip, I got a notification they had canceled my return flight so I, therefore, began to call them to book a new return flight. I spent hours on hold and wasn't able to reach anyone. We finally paid and booked a return flight with another company. Once I returned home I called them everyday and spent hours on hold. When I finally reach someone they kept transferring me back and forth to different employees. None who could help me since they never transferred me to the right department. I will never book with them again and please take my advice its not worth it. They have horrible customer service!

### "cancelled and no refund"
My flight was affected by COVID-19. First of all I did not leave UK due to a lock down. Then I could not use Interjet, because I did not get to Mexico. Mexico and Cuba closed borders too. The flight was cancelled and no refund, because INTERJET airline differ customers! If you bought a ticket on the offer like me you are worse class, therefore you can not receive a full refund, no matter what. I would add that their customer services are rude and improfessional. The ticketing department do not speak English.

### "Never fly Interjet again"
Not Verified | El Salvador to Cancun via Mexico City. I had a flight from Cancun to Istanbul by Turkish Airlines to catch on March 23rd. So I bought an Interjet ticket, El Salvador to Cancun on March 18 to catch my flight. But after the Covid-19 El Salvador closed the borders so I was not able to go there from Nicaragua to catch my flight. Also Turkish Airlines offered full refund or date change or open ticket or route change for free. Upon calling Interjet several times and having waited hours on the phone they didn’t accept to refund me and forced me to change my flight to a different date and made me pay $35 more as price difference even though the new ticket was less than what I paid before. When I asked the agent, he told me “buying and changing is different, don’t expect the same prices” Even while changing the date they had so many blackouts I had to buy the new ticket for the 31st of March, not a preferred date in order to avoid more price difference and few dates were left after blackouts. Then Interjet canceled all of their international flights due to travel restrictions. I was in Nicaragua and couldn’t go to El Salvador anyway because of the closed borders and was looking for alternative options to reach my country. So I called the Interjet customer service again spending hours on the phone. They told me that I need to call a different number that I could never reach. So, I sent an e-mail to the customer service explaining my situation but no reply received for almost a week. Then today tried to call the customer service several times again waiting over half an hour each time and losing connections or making me wait and never answer the phone again. Eventually I was able to talk to an agent. They offered no refund, no open ticket, no credit, no route change. Just date change with paying price difference for a flight I’m not able to take. They also told me that I will lose all my rights over the ticket if I don’t make the changes 24h before the supposed-flight. So “either pay more money for this ticket to change the date (already their prices are higher than usual) or forget your money” That’s what they offered. When I told the agent that it is illegal as they have canceled the flight themselves and legally had to refund she said it’s not a cancellation because of a mechanical problem in the plane and they didn’t have any responsibility as an airline. After a fruitless discussion, she wanted me to stay on hold. But after waiting for more than 1 hour I was disconnected. Final word: Never fly Interjet again.

### "Interjet is terrible service"
Not Verified |  Mexico City to Dallas. I was on the phone for 3-4 hours they was not any single person how can help to make any changes to get the flight fixed. I recommend people don’t buy any flights with this airline, Interjet is terrible service and they don’t care about anything else, just there money. Hope people really don’t buy tickets with them.

### "extreme lack of customer service is pathetic"
Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City. Due to the coronavirus, we were forced to cancel our trip to Mexico and as a result had to cancel all of our flights. Please, do not waste your time with this company as their extreme lack of customer service is pathetic. Our other airlines were great in offering refunds but Interjet failed miserably at even picking up the phone or answering several emails. Let me tell you that sitting on the phone waiting for someone to pick up for hours is not how I would like to be spending my evenings. All they want is to your money. Again, do not waste your time with this airline, just take your business elsewhere.

### "proposed date change, no refund"
Not Verified |  My flight was canceled due to the Covid-19. Customer service only proposed date change, no refund. And when I try to be comprehensive, and I asked to change the date, I have only until my purchase date +1 year, (=8 months in my case) which didn't work for me. As I can't use this ticket before that limited date, their answer was: we can't do anything for you, it's our politic. I regret I chose Interjet, a cheap company with not only cheap service but no flexibility during a worldwide crisis when all other airline companies show much more flexibility with their usual conditions to make sure they keep their customer satisfied. As a result, both my girlfriend and I lost 400 USD. I strongly recommend avoiding this company.

### "a terrible experience with Interjet"
Not Verified |  We had a terrible experience with Interjet. Similar to several other’s ones, without any notification, our flight was canceled and we were told this just at their airport counter in the morning of departing date when we arrived for check in. We even checked their status the night before and it’s schedule had shown on time, however following morning we found at airport that their flights had been all canceled for the day, not just our booked flight, so they just gave us an option for following day’s flight, and gave us some customer services numbers to call for any additional requests because they said they cannot make any other changes at the counter, nor have any physical sales office to walk in, so we ended up buying another tickets with other more reliable airline and kept calling Interjet for refund but no one picked up and responded. It was then next day someone finally picked up our call after hundreds of attempts and waiting hours, then they told they cannot refund because airport counter service should have given us available options which could be different flight, different route, or different dates. So we asked based on their policy they won’t refund even they canceled all the flight for the day and if they just gave us so called “option” even at a different date, which could be even a week after from our booked date, they won’t give us refund ? They said yes... this is insane. We will never ever use Interjet and suggest anyone not to travel with them.

### "they never answer"
Not Verified | Guadalajara to Las Vegas. 27th March 2020 I booked a trip to Guadalajara from Las Vegas on March 1st, 2020. Leaving Las Vegas on March 28th 2020. And due to availability, I had to book with Interjet for my way back home. I had booked a flight from Guadalajara to Las Vegas to fly out on the 2nd of April of 2020. I have been trying to reach Interjet, and they never answer their phone. Due to the Corona Virus, I was advised by my primary physician not to travel outside of the US, I been calling Interjet to change it and they never answer. I went online to change my flight to another date and they referred me to customer service to change it. Interjet will not let us change our date or cancel our flight. I have been calling several times and they never answer. The call gets disconnected within a few seconds. This is frustrating.

### "would not provide a refund"
San Francisco to Guadalajara. Absolutely horrible response to the coronavirus situation. Interjet cancelled my flights and would not provide a refund, only allowing to change flights to other dates with more expensive fares. A customer should not have to pay more money to change a flight that was cancelled. All of their other competitors offered refunds or travel credit for flights cancelled due to the coronavirus but Interjet prefers to just take people's money. I am now losing $370 USD / $8500 MXN for these cancelled flights. Keep in mind that they normally offer refunds for cancelled flights but not for any flights that were cancelled due to COVID-19. What greedy, pathetic scammers taking advantage of a world pandemic to line their pockets. I used to fly Interjet often but will NEVER book a flight with Interjet again. Too many other airlines out there flying the same routes to ever choose a company as inconsiderate and criminal as this one.

### "provided me with nothing"
I booked a flight to Mexico City from Toronto, scheduled to be flying on 27/03/2020 00:35Hr. However, when I checked the Interjet.com, there was an important announcement saying that all international flights are cancelled from March 24th, 2020. So the problem is, first, I did not even get any notification on the cancellation for my flight so I could have just packed and gone to the airport only to realize that the flight is cancelled. So I emailed the company about it and never got any responses. Secondly, when I called them to get my ticket refunded or change the date, they did not answer any of my calls and instead there was an automatic message saying that the customer service is not available. Thirdly, I tried to change the date using their website, but it just freezes every-time I press confirm at the end. I emailed them again about this situation and they still did not get back. In a nutshell, they cancelled my flight without even telling me, not answering my phone calls to all of their customer service numbers, and their web site is frozen when I try to use the "date change" function from the website. They don't even reply to any of my emails. It just looks like the company just decided to do nothing about the current situation. They simply just took my money and provided me with nothing. This is just so shameful to watch how they do the business.

### "will not let us change our date"
Not Verified |  Internet is bad news due to this coronavirus. Interjet will not let us change our date for next year even though we are consumers who paid for this. Do not fly Interjet, you call the 866-285-9525 number and no one speaks English. This is frustrating.

### "Interjet is not reimbursing!"
I had booked a flight from Los Angeles to Cancun via Mexico City to fly out on the 25th of March 2020. I get a notice from Interjet 1 day before my flight that all international flights have been cancelled due to the Corona Virus. I went to change my flight to another date and they want to charge me 139 dollars each way since I did not make the change 24 hours prior to my flight?! How are they not going to honor my change when Interjet didn't even give myself a 24 hour notice? So they are going to notify me on March 24,2020 about international flight cancellation and I try to adjust my flight on that same day and they want to charge me 139.00 each way for not changing 24 hours in advance?! I wasn't even asking for a refund! How is that even possible! It's not even about the money anymore. Its about principle! Do what is right Interjet and stop being so greedy! We are being unfairly charged for these flights that Interjet is not reimbursing! All other airlines are reimbursing their customers with no issues, but Interjet is not!

### "I was left stranded"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Cancun. The airline cancels my flight and cancels all future flights and tells me that I can only make a change to the date and pay the price difference. I tried to explain that how can I make a change to something or future that doesn’t exist in your system. Their only response is that’s our policy. I was left stranded and had to book back with a reputable airline, Westjet who were amazing and very professional. Would never fly with Interjet even if the price was super cheap. Not worth it as they don’t respect their clients and honour their tickets.

### "I will never fly Interjet again"
On February 29, 2020 I flew with my wife from Huatulco to Chicago via Mexico city. Unfortunately the Interjet Airline damaged my suitcase. After I wanted to file a claim and I e-mailed customer service they practically refused the claim, asking to fill up some probably non existing form. I e-mailed them again explained the situation again, but they did not react at all. Despite extra baggage charge they are not able take at least little responsibility. I know this is very hard time again especially with travel industries, but companies like Interjet make the situation for them even worse. My recommendation pay the extra money to use a better airline. I will never fly Interjet again.

### "no soap dispensers"
Not Verified | Mexico City to New York. Interjet is such a cheap airline they removed the soap from all the bathrooms (I checked). Not just the soap but the soap dispensers! This was as the Coronavirus had begun to spread. I asked a flight attendant where the soap was. She pulled liquid soap out of her own bag and gave me a squirt. Apparently the flight attendants either carry their own soap or they can't wash their hands well, yet they serve drinks to the passengers. The passengers couldn't wash their hands with soap. What was Interjet thinking to have no soap dispensers in the midst of a pandemic?

### "do not recommend this airline"
Dallas to Lima via Mexico City. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Their customer service is horrible they are very rude and also take hours upon hours not only to answer your phone calls but also to solve your issues if you get lucky enough for them to solve it. They are constantly rescheduling flights without prior notice and don't even bother to let you know until you show up to the airport to check-in. If you're lucky enough to even make it to your flight, once onboard they don't even offer you complimentary water. Everything has to be bought on board if you want to drink or eat, even water. I do not recommend this airline to anyone and I will never use it myself again.

### "incredibly selfish and inflexible"
Not Verified |  This airline is incredibly selfish and inflexible during the Coronavirus outbreak. We bought our tickets to Peru from LAX months ago because the flights were cheap at the time. Peru has closed their borders so we cannot travel on our flight. The airline refuses to refund our flight and will only change it but we have to pay the difference in ticket price. They could not find a single date we could change the ticket to where we did not have to pay a 50% increase or more. It is unacceptable that we were not given another option to get at least some of our money back without paying more money. Do not consider flying this airline. You never know what could be happening and this airline will NOT try to help you.

### "Never again interjet"
Not Verified |  Never again interjet. I will never book with you again nor fly with interjet airlines. After suffering 2 agonizing hours stuck on flight 2383 from Cancun to Mexico D.F. with screaming kids, babies because they could not start the airplane. No air conditioning on board, airline stewardesses did nothing to help the elderly, pregnant woman nor anyone.even offer water. The passengers had to get out of there seats to get there own water. After about an hour or so they decided to open the emergency doors because they would not allow anyone to get off. Then on flight they charged for all the snack and beverages. Once arrived at D.F. and missed our connecting flight to LAX. We waited another 2 hours with no explanations and no luggage. We came across 2 supervisor with no customer service or care for the passengers. They did accommodate hotel nor food for all the passengers that missed the flight. Next flight 5am the following day. No comp for plain tickets, no comp for Hotel, they could care less about all those passengers they told us to sleep where ever we could in the airport. Then they gave every person 145 pesos for dinner and breakfast. Then to restaurants that where already closed.

### "first and last time on Interjet"
Not Verified |  Guárdala to Chicago. The first and last time I have traveled on Interjet. From one to ten I give you 4 the 4-hour flight and they don't give you anything or any peanuts. Laprimera y la última vez que viajó en la aerolínea de (Interjet) del uno al diez le doy 4 el vuelo doro 4 horas y No te dan nada ni onos cacahuetes

### "we have lost all our money"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Cancun via Mexico city. Terrible airline. During the course of Covid-19 Pandemic, they were very unreasonable to reschedule our flights from Mar 21, 2020 to Nov 2020, based on our tickets being purchased in July 2019 since this would then be over 1 year from date of booking and this is not allowed according to Interjet! There was no other recourse for us, and we have lost all our money, $3000 for 6 travellers. Never  will I recommend this airline.

### "I couldn't believe my ears"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Mexico City. Literally went to the airline to plead with them that some of the people flying have most likely contracted COVID 19 and were told to self quarantine that they should niy fly to stop the spread. The airline literally said if they decide to fly it's not the airlines responsibility that if they decide not to, the best the airline could do is help reschedule with a 1200$ fee. This is ridiculous I couldn't believe my ears.

### "Do not check in your bags"
Mexico City to Houston. Do not check in your bags. I paid to check in 2 bags and things were stolen. I did not realize it until I got home. I called numerous numerous times and nobody would let me do a report because I had left the airport. They do not care about the customers.

### "pay more for a better airline"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Merida via Mexico City. Our flight to Mexico City was a late flight. No refreshments were offered until 4 hours into the flight. Our return flight was from Merida to Mexico city and then 6 hours later Mexico city to Toronto. Our connecting flight was changed to 24 hours so we took our luggage and stayed at a hotel. Upon returning to the airport to check in we were told we had to pay for our baggage. We refused and after an hour of explaining that they had changed to original flight times they didn't charge us. Our flight was for 1150 pm with boarding at 1120. Our flight wasn't on the board and never actually appeared on the board. We went to a gate hoping we were in the right area to wait. Our flight time came and went and no announcement or anything. Finally at 130 am we were told our flight was unloading. We finally boarded at around 2 am with no apology or explanation of why it hadn't shown up on the flight board or why they were so late. To top it all off someone brought a cat on board in the cabin a row behind us. The poor cat screamed literally the whole flight. Never again. I will pay more for a better airline.

### "changed my booking"
Mexico City to Meridia. Despite the comfortable Airbus and the nice staff, I will never use this company anymore. They changed my booking to a late-night flight without even notifying me! (I checked my reservation the night before the flight and find all good) so I go to the airport in time and realize they canceled my flight and booked me a late flight (that, of course, is delayed). No explanation, no assistance in the airport, they don't even tell you they changed your flight! I check-in, go to the gate to board and then I realize I'm in another flight.

### "worst experience I have had"
Toronto to Mexico City. After I bought my original ticket with no issues, I tried to change it via online with no success. The system gave error after error. I gave up since I didn’t want to call their telephone service which takes 40+ min. When I arrived to the counter to check-in, the person told me that in the interjet system I did actually change my flight. This was not notified to me in any form. I had to pay the change fee or I would lose my flight all together. Conveniently, the change that I never did, was to first class. When I finally got to my flight, it gets cancelled due to technical failures. I hurried to book a hotel for the night but I know that some people didn’t get a place, the hotels where full booked at 1 am. This is the worst experience I have had with any airline, I will never use them again and I definitely not recommend them.

### "The worst customer service"
Montreal to Mexico City. The worst customer service. We bought our ticket in November 28. The day after, (under 24 hours) we saw a ticket 200$ cheaper (each, so x2 = 400$). We decided to call Interjet and see if we could make a refund since it's under 24 hours of purchase. They said that there was no problem, that we have to send them our banking information by email and that they will refund us under 30 days. Today, we are February 28, 2020, and we still don't have our money back. We have been calling them and email them for months. The ticket was really not cheap since it was in high season. I cannot refund my credit card by my self. This was not suppose to happen. Now i have been paying credit card interest. In few months, my 400$ of saving by canceling my flight, will be eliminated by my credit card fees. They are only telling us that they put our case higher and higher, but we still have no answer. I don't know what to do honestly it's a nightmare.

### "absolute worst airline"
San Jose to Mexico City. The absolute worst airline. I received no notification my flight was cancelled. They refused to get me another flight. I only learned that my flight was cancelled when I arrived at the checkin desk at the airport. No email, no phone call and when I checked my flight status online the server was down. They refused to put me on a same day flight or cover my expenses. When I asked them to pay for another airline they said it is against the policy of Interjet. They only provided me a phone number to call. I called the number and they transferred my 5 times, then they told me to call a different number. No customer service!

### "Worst airline ever"
I flew from Hermosillo to Calgary on Feb 24. To make sure I would have a smooth ride went to the airport to enquire on my trip the next day. I was told I would get my bag at Montreal airport but my bag never came. Phoned Interjet and they told me it never came because the plane was already full with too many bags. They phone me on Feb 26 and told me my bag would come on Feb 27 to Calgary. I live 3hrs away. I ask for the bag to be delivered to Medicine Hat they told me they could not. Worst airline ever.

### "wouldn't recommend them"
Vancouver to Medellin via Mexico City. When I checked in at YVR, Vancouver, I thought "how strange, that check-in employee was really dry and rude". He barely spoke to me at all and looked like he was just having a bad day. Little did I know, that would be the general mood I'd find in every Interjet employee going forward. When I arrived at home after 2 days of travel, I was notified that the airline had left my suitcase, with every piece of clothing I had that wasn't on my body. I was told that if it took longer than 48 hours to get to my door, I'd get compensation because I'd clearly have to get new clothing. They took over a month to respond to my request for compensation saying it "wasn't their responsibility". I have yet to fly with an airline that cares so little about their clients. I am done with them and wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy.

### "Horrible service"
Merida to Mexico City. Horrible service. The airline employee took my carry-on bag against my wishes and arguments. They claimed it was overweight, but it still ended up on the airplane as checked baggage. Now I have to get it from baggage against my will, which will probably make me miss my next flight. They also only serve sugary soda (no water or coffee) as drinks out of single-use bottles.

### "Don't waste your time or money"
Vancouver to Mexico City. Don't waste your time or money with Interjet. They changed my flight time a few days before my trip which would not allow me to make my connection in Mexico City. I contacted them and was offered a refund. That was 6 months ago. I have been contacting them weekly to follow up on the progress and I keep getting the same answer from any CSR that I speak with; "We will expedite the refund for you, you should receive it in 5 business days. No there is no supervisor you may speak with" "wow I cant believe they have not refunded you yet" Guess I will be contacting them daily to see if I ever see my money again.

### "Overall better than expected"
Bogota to Mexico City. The check-in process is painfully slow but the airport staff was very friendly. I have never seen so much care in applying the baggage tags. I think there were 5 tags in total per bag. The flight was on time and uneventful. The plane was quite new (4 years) but had no entertainment system, apart from some scattered displays - they do show the takeoff and landing which is kind of cool for a plane this size. The legroom was above average and quite comfortable. The service included a small bag of snacks and a drink. Overall better than expected - I would fly again.

### "This airline is a joke"
Mexico City to Los Angeles. This airline is a joke, staff are untrained and incompetent, they  lose luggage. If you book on a different website, they will double charge you for seat selection and baggage. Note if you book on Interjet, they may double charge your credit card and take 5 months to return it. It is about 100-150$ more to fly with a different airline. Sometimes even the same price. Save yourself from buying tickets the spending countless money on getting you things where you need them to go. Also any connection in Mexico City with them, give yourself an extra 3-4 hours for layover time. Or you will miss your flight, they don’t care how long the customs line is when you try to change flights.

### "most boneheaded experience"
The most boneheaded experience I've ever had on an airline. Flying from Miami to Guadalajara via Mexico City. Arriving in Mexico City it proved impossible to discover the gate associated with my connecting flight. Not present in the airport departures listing. A random Interjet gate agent urged me to 'wait 20 minutes'. 20 minutes later urged me to 'go upstairs and ask at the Interjet desk'. Visit the desk and am told, 'Gate T'. Go to Gate T and find Tampico passengers being boarded. Return to the Interjet desk, told Guadalajara boarding after Tampico. Return to Gate T and a lengthy wait until I am sitting at a deserted gate. Return to the Interjet desk. Oh, that flight has departed. WTF! From where because it didn't leave from the gate you sent me to. Go downstairs and see my supervisor and she will book you on another flight. Supervisor insists that the gate information was sent to the airport and 'not our fault' that it wasn't displayed. Of course not, who would have the audacity to blame Interjet for this mess up. And thanks for the heartfelt sympathy. So now my 9PM connection is a 6AM connection and I am enjoying the night at an airport gate. If I wanted to fly for 20 hours I would have booked a flight to Asia. Interjet is the airline that can't shoot straight.

### "I do not recommend it"
Not Verified |  First the flight was delayed for 3 hours then we got on the plane we never took off we were told that an engine did not start and we waited at least another 3 hours we arrived at CDMX at approximately 6 o'clock our flight from CDMX to Villahermosa left at 4 almost 5 (we lost it ) They told us that the other flight was at 6:45 after no longer that now at 8:30 we arrived to ask for our tickets and they told us that there was no longer space that the only flight was until the next day at 5: 30 in the morning and we had to be there at 3 in the morning. We had not eaten (nor had lunch or dinner) We were tired and apart they tell us that at 3 in the morning we have to be at the airport And adding that they did not even know what gate we had on the next day. Terrible airline. I do not recommend it at all. Disorganized, irresponsible. Primero se retraso el vuelo por 3 horas luego nos subimos al avión nunca despegamos nos dijeron que un motor no arancaba y esperamos mínimo otras 3 horas llegamos a CDMX aproximadamente a las 6 nuestro vuelo de CDMX a Villahermosa salía a las 4 casi 5 (lo perdimos) nos dijeron que el otro vuelo era a las 6:45 luego que ya no que ahora a las 8:30 llegamos a pedir nuestros boletos y nos dijeron que ya no había espacio que el único vuelo era hasta el siguiente día a las 5:30 de la mañana y teníamos que estar ahí a las 3 de la madrugada. No habíamos comido ( ni almorzado ni cenado) Estábamos cansadas y aparte nos dicen que a las 3 de la madrugada tenemos que estar en el aeropuerto Y agregándole ni siquiera sabían que gate nos tocaba al siguiente día Pésima aerolínea no la recomiendo para nada. Desorganizados, irresponsables. 0 estrellas.

### "Cannot be trusted"
El Salvador to Mexico City. I flew with Interjet a week ago. I had some luggage vandalised and destroyed with a sharp object. I reported the incident immediately at airport. A report was taken. When I contacted staff of interjet, not a single person wanted to help. On the phone they hung up. At the airport they sent me to another city to report. On email they only say automated polite response. They stop responding and never helped. This is the worst airline. No customer service. No support. Do not fly with them. Worst experience. The flights were cancelled. They had no airplane for us. Had to wait an entire day. Cannot be trusted.

### "$35 charge to make the change"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Monterrey. Just made reservations for 4 one way flights with Interjet. One one leg, I made a mistake of choosing a afternoon flight instead of a morning flight from Mexico City to Guadalajara. After realizing my mistake, I called Interjet customer service (within 15 minutes) I was told that there will be a $35 charge to make the change. Are you serious Interjet?? I just spent over $900.00 on 4 flights and you are going to charge me another $35 for a change that shouldn't take more than 2 minutes to make?? Shame on you. I will never fly with your airline again.

### "my first and last time flying with them"
Mexico City to Dallas with Interjet. This is probably my first and last time flying with them, even though the ticket is slightly cheaper the check-in process took 2 hours and I already checked in online. Luckily I arrived 3 hours before my flight.

### "never be using them again"
Cancun to San Antonio via Mexico City. I went to Cancun to celebrate one of my dear friend's marriage. On the way back from Cancun to San Antonio, we had a connecting flight in Mexico City. We get from Cancun to Mexico City just fine, although we did not leave until 45 minutes after the scheduled departure, which was never mentioned by the Interjet staff. Luckily, our layover in Mexico City was long enough that a 45 minute delay would not make us miss our flight home. Boy, do I wish a 45 minute delay was the worst of our worries. We finally board the plane in Mexico City when we are told that it is too foggy in San Antonio to land the plane safely. They told us we would wait 30 minutes for another weather report. 30 minutes later, it is still too foggy. They told us to wait another 45 minutes for another report. After waiting on the tarmac for a total of 2 hours, they cancel our flight. Keep in mind that it had been foggy in San Antonio all day that day.. so why did we even board the plane?? They tell us to wait for our individual names to be called to obtain our immigration papers and exit the plane. We were the last few people off the plane and when we were finally off, nobody from Interjet was instructing us on where to go or what to do. We stood in the immigration line for about 45 minutes, then went to baggage claim because that's just where the crowd lead us.. After 1 hour of asking multiple staff members where to go to get another flight home, we finally were instructed to go to the Interjet ticketing line. Waited in that line for 2 more hours just for them to tell us that they could not accommodate us what so ever because it was a weather issue. The best they could do for us was get us on a flight the next day (over 24 hours later). No hotel accommodations. There was only 1 supervisor on duty and conveniently, the only staff member who spoke English. Other passengers were calling the San Antonio airport to check on the status of incoming flights. The San Antonio airport reported that many flights were landing without a problem that night. I am out $500 because I had to buy a hotel room and a flight on a different airline to get home sooner. I missed another full day of work because of Interjet. Interjet is the absolute WORST airline I have flown, and I will never be using them again. You shouldn't either. Don't even consider it!

### "Never will I use them again "
My flight from San Antonio to Mexico City was canceled with this airline on Jan 13/2020 supposedly due to bad weather. This is what they said so that they didn’t have to compensate any passengers. It was canceled around 7ish. They said we had to go back to the ticket counter to see what we needed to do. Waited in that line from the time they canceled to almost 11:00 p . Just to find I only had two options call customer service for a refund or take another flight on 01/14 at 8:00 pm at night. I waited hours to hear that. They had no clue what they were doing they had maybe 3 people working basically to tell you oh well. I called customer service only to be told at first no supervisor spoke English. I called in the morning to ask not for a refund but for some type of credit for a future flight. I was told absolutely not. They said I should’ve bought the insurance they offered. I’m now out that money and more because I bought another ticket with a different airline for a lot earlier flight. These people don’t care how much money you spend with them or how many times you’ve used them. They don’t belong operating in the United States. They are slow and unprofessional. Never will I use them again and for anyone reading this good luck.

### "worst airline we have ever flown"
We booked non-stop roundtrip flights from San Francisco to Cancun for December 21, 2019 to January 4, 2020 way back in February 2019. When we went online December 20 to see about check-in we saw that they had put us on an overnight flight December 24 with 2 stops and a huge layover and changed our return to the same thing a day later than we needed to return. They had us missing 3 days of vacation & Christmas & also missing work on our return. We were never informed of these changes. We spent hours on the phone, getting passed around, cut off & getting no help that night & the next day. We had to book very expensive flights on another airline to get there in time for our hotel reservations, etc. We had to keep the flights coming back & it was a total nightmare. An 8 hour overnight layover in Mexico City just to get as far as Guadalajara. It took 18 hours altogether to get back & we both had to miss work. I believe they are running a scam advertising very good flights at a reasonable cost & then "canceling" the flights and putting customers on these terrible ones that no one would purchase on purpose. Also nonexistent customer service at the airport as well as by telephone and online. Definitely the worst airline we have ever flown.

### "What a bad experience"
Not Verified | Calgary to Mexico City. I wanted to change my returning flight because by mistake I chose the wrong date (1 day earlier) and they asked me to pay 150$ USD to change my flight when the ticket cost me 250$ USD. Freaking thieves. What a bad experience.

### "worst customer service ever"
This has to be the worst airline. In Puerto Vallarta we had the very first InterJet flight out. Was it on time? Nope! Over 1 hour late and all they had to do was bring it to the ramp for boarding. The person checking people in was not even there until 10 minutes before boarding. We arrive at Mexico City at 10:20. Our next flight is at 8:30pm. But there is a flight at 12:20pm to Leon and were told by the counter there is 40 available seats and to come back at 12pm and they will put us on the earlier flight. We go back at 12pm and there is a mob of people about ready to riot. They were supposed to leave to Cancun on InterJet at 10am and 2 hours later nobody said a word to them and it turns out the pilot couldn't be bothered to come to work so they were screwed and turned away with no resolve. With all of that they asked if we could just go to the gate of the earlier flight and they would take care of us. Now that flight is late and the darn thing is sitting in the gate already. Turns out it was the very plane we flew in on. The lady did not arrive to check people into the plane until 1 minute before boarding. All the while the sign says it is on time and eventually left 45 minutes late for a plane that was already there and waiting with no people on it. My wife talked to the employee and she said NO. Them said if she did that then the numbers would be messed up and what about the late flight we would have been on? Really? So she walked away from us and pulled back the ramp. She left her screen up showing seating. There were at least 17 available seats that I could tell on her screen. After us there was one person with a boarding pass for the flights and she said she didn't have him in the system and told him to leave. Funny thing about that. We started in Puerto working in the earlier flight and the lady at the counter printed boarding passes for us because she didn't show us in the system even though we had the electronic passes literally on the InterJet app. This airline has the absolute worst customer service ever.

### "still fighting to have my refund"
Montreal to Medellin via Cancun. I've booked a flight to Medellin  with Interjet and they decided to cancel my flight for no reason without advising me. I asked for a full refund which they said would be processed and it has been almost two months and still nothing. They've been giving me the run around this whole time plus they don't hold themself accountable for their actions.They are the most incompetent and unprofessional company I've ever known. I'm still fighting to have my refund.

### "Worst airline I ever flew"
Lima to Leon via Mexico City. Worst airline I ever flew. They send me an email one day before my flight which stated that I was rebooked on a flight 7 hours later than I originally booked. Therefore I had to wait for 12 hours at my connection airport and the only compensation they gave me was a food coupon worth 7€ which could only be used at 3 restaurants of which 2 were closed. I send an email to the customer service to request a refund or compensation but considering the reviews here, I'm pretty sure they wont give anything. Never again with this airline. Avoid it by all costs please.

### "Shocking customer service"
Not Verified |  Mexico to Oaxaca. Shocking customer service. My flight was cancelled so I was put on a much later flight, when I tried to contact the airline via email and phone many times over 3 days I eventually went to the airport to make the change in person. I stood in line for over an hour as I needed to wait for the passengers to board their plane as another flight had been cancelled. I spoke to a representative in the queue who was not at all helpful and suggested I return in 4 hours. In the end I booked another flight with Volaris and will think twice about booking with Interjet again. Holidays are too short and too much valued to waste so much time on such matters.

### "gutted and disappointed"
Mexico City to Los Angeles. Be careful with this airline. I have a Samsonite suitcase that had been used twice prior to this trip and in perfect condition. In Mexico, we requested a fragile sticker and still had one from the previous flight. Our suitcase was 3 kgs under the weight limit. On arrival in LAX we waited for some time, we then were called to the office as my case had been damaged. The whole case was bent, trolly handles don’t move, wheels don’t roll, material rubbed and frayed inside items were smashed and once home I realised the inside frame was bent and exposing the bits and pieces that hold the case together. It cannot be used again. I read on there website that they are liable and figured a part payment or compensation would be offered. We travelled by Qantas who compensated a damaged suitcase years ago, no trouble and done within 14 working days (it dropped from a plane and was badly damaged). Damaged Baggage: If your baggage is damaged after the flight, we will be liable for the damage incurred. The best thing to do is to report the damage to the Lost & Found office as soon as you collect it. In most airports, the Lost & Found office is located in the baggage reclaim area. Costs are only assumed if the damage has been confirmed in the report. In Mexico, these compensations are governed by the Civil Aviation Law, while in our international destinations are based on the Montreal Convention. In any case, both the airport where you registered the damage and our Customer Care Center, will answer any questions you may have. Generic Emails back and forth for a month, asking for more photos when we had already sent them and their own staff were there when we opened the case and signed all the paperwork, honestly the worst experience, they were never going payout and by the attitude of staff in LAX and through the customer service centre (I have spent hours ringing them) I think they have never paid out a cent. Reading reviews online, it seems like many people have had similar experiences. I am gutted and disappointed and we will not be flying Interjet or recommending this airline to anyone.

### "Not helpful at all"
Not Verified |  
Vancouver to Cancun via Mexico City with Interjet. Not good. Cancelled the direct flight, offered to re-book us via Mexico City adding about four hours travel time. The flight to Mexico City was delayed an hour and no time was made up to catch our connection. Nor was any effort made to get us to our connection or rebook us on another flight which have could have been done while we were in the air. The desk wasn't really interested and seemed indifferent and had a lot of people on the same flight to rebook to Cancun. Not helpful at all and only one person who kept getting called away could rebook the flight. They delayed us another six hours and offered nothing else to keep us occupied for these hours. In summary, if you want a flight somewhat resembling the flight you initially booked don't flight with Interjet haha. Enjoy another airline that will help keep your holiday on schedule.

### "worst possible customer service"
I flew with my daughter and 3 year old grandson from Houston to Mexico City. the flight was delayed 3 hours. Very hard when you travel with a toddler. My daughter and grandson flew back to Houston with Interjet within a week. Again, flight was delayed for several hours. My return was scheduled for November 19, 2019. For medical reasons, I had to reschedule my return and called Interjet "listed" numbers --none of them work-- and when I was finally able to reach a working number, I was held on the line, after listening for over 30 minutes to their "non-stop deals": the line disconnected. This happened every day, a week prior to my scheduled return. Finally, my daughter placed a three-way telephone conference call from Houston to Mexico City to Interjet. This time, we continued to listen to their incessant deals for 40 minutes ... again, call dropped. I was unable to reschedule a flight back home at a later date and I was not able to show up at the airport. What for? I could not travel on November 19 and neither was I able to speak to a representative to explain my situation. Consequently, I assume I lost my ticket and will have to buy another one? However,my only option was to send an email to Interjet, prior to my departure, to document in writing my daily failed attempts to reach them, my frustration, waste of time, and worst possible customer service.

### "charged us twice for a flight"
Not Verified |  Interjet charged us twice for a flight in October. We booked and paid for the flight in April. When we arrived at the airport in October to check into our flight we were told by the desk agent that the original credit card didn’t go through. We provided proof that the flight had already been paid for but were told by the desk agent there was nothing he could do. We should repay for the flight and contact customer service to be refunded” He then provided us with an incorrect phone number for customer service. It has been over a month and we have had no response to our emails and customer service keeps transferring us to the sales department every time we describe our issue to them over the phone. After looking on this site and seeing many emails describing the same experience I would issue a strong warning to anyone flying with this company. We have contacted Transportation Canada, the consumer protection agency to report this extortion.

### "airline is unorganized"
Not Verified |  The worst airline experience. I'm currently writing this review at Mexico City airport due to this incompetent company. We arrived well in advance for our connecting flight and then received an email 1 hour before our flight stating the flight would be boarding an hour later than originally scheduled. We get to our gate 50 minutes before our new boarding time and the flight took off as originally scheduled, unlike the email we received. When we spoke to staff about getting a new flight the guy was rude and offensive, basically blaming us for missing the flight and suggested that we don't drink before flights next time. We did not miss our flight due to the one beer we had, we missed the flight because this airline is unorganized and has no decency or any sense of customer service.

### "worst travelling experience"
I bought a ticket for a flight from Montreal to Mexico City on October 25th at 10h25 pm and a return ticket from Mexico city to cancun at 11h00 am with ransfer  to Montreal (fl. 2820) at 17h00. Flght AIJ2811 departed with 1h15 delay from Montreal where we all had to wait in a very cold corridor, standing up, or lying down, with no access to a bathroom, with crying babies, then they decided, we would board (15 min. before midnight) and for unknown reason they decided that the flight would be diverted to Cancun to fill the tank. We were supposed to get to MEX at 3h25 am. Result: we landed in Mexico more than 3hrs later, I had hired and paid for a taxi through Booking) to pick me up between 5h and 6h am. The driver waited until 4h30 and then decided to leave, Result I lost the fee for that taxi driver and then had to pay for another one from the taxi pool which is not advisable for a woman alone in Mexico. 2, On Nov. 2, I got an e-mail from Interjet that my flight was now Mexico to Montreal, Being now aware that they do change the flights at a whim, I thought that they managed to give me a direct flight to Montreal instead of the 2 flights trip I had bought. So the taxi delivered me to the area for International departures of Interjet. But no, after waiting in line for a good half hour, Seems it was a mistake, that my previous booking was still standing. So I rushed to the national departures (about the distance of a football field to cross) for my flight that was supposed to leave at 11h am. 3. But no worry that flight was late.(fl. 2370) It left at 1h45, We landed in Cancun at close to 3h00, I had to collect my luggage at the conveyor and re-register it and then had to go through security once again and then, realising that Cancun time was an hour later, I arrived at gate 56 to be told that the plane had just left. (fl.2820) 4. Re-crossing the whole airport again, they gave me another ticket back to Mexico (which left later than scheduled) with a ransfer for Montreal at 1h00 am (fl. 2811) (which actually left at 2h40 am). In conclusion I had 3 flights, spent 27 hrs in planes or at airports on that day and arrived a whole day later than expected. All because the first flight of the day was late) 5. Upon arrival in Montreal, my luggage which was alright when I re-registered it in Cancun, had been opened, the lock was gone and they broke one of the wheels, so it is a total loss. At this point, I am still unsure if anything disappeared from it, So I do not recommend Interjet. It is by far the worst travelling experience I ever had.

### "terrible customer service"
Not Verified | Chicago to Mexico City. My wife booked a flight to leave at 3 pm with our 1 year old - about 25 hours before, they emailed us that they switched the flight to a different one at 1 am in the morning for no reason. We called customer service, waited on hold for around 3 hours to be told that they were not going to do anything about it. She basically has to accept the new flight or not go. Could not believe it. Absolutely terrible customer service. How can you do that to a person? Terrible company - you can't treat people like that!

### "would never fly with again"
Cancun to Mexico City. Our original flight was cancelled and were sent confirmation of the change to a flight some 8 hours later via email, less than 24 hours prior. After waiting for 8 hours in Cancun airport as we'd originally scheduled a connecting flight from our London flight, we then had to wait a subsequent 2 hours with little or no information until flight finally left Cancun around 1 am. The service desk at Cancun airport was extremely slow and not very accommodating, as was the customer service when I phoned to see if we could catch a different flight after being told our original one was delayed. We received no apologies, no compensation, no food or beverages in the airport and crucially, no explanation as to why the original flight was cancelled and subsequent one was delayed. Once aboard, the flight went smoothly, but everything prior to it was dreadful and would never fly with again.

### "lack of accountability"
Guadalajara to Mexico City. Lateness, but more than anything my rating goes to the severe lack of accountability for the crew and don't even get me started in their archaic and ineffective boarding system. Sitting in row 5 - guess where my luggage ended being? Row 27! Yes, because this “team” blames the ground staff for the boarding process starting from the end of the aircraft allowing those in the rear to place their luggage in the front. Good luck deplaning right? Your service is poor - big time!

### "the worst customer service"
Interjet canceled our nonstop flight from Cancun to San Francisco on New Years Day. They put us a 3 leg flight that would have taken a total 24 hours to get back home. I declined that. They stated it would take 15-20 days for a refund. None has come through. I finally contacted my credit card company to have them handle the dispute instead. To top it all off, our new tickets home cost double because we booked this long ago for new years day. Now the flights are way more expensive. This company is effing awful and has the worst customer service.

### "cancelling or delaying flights"
Lima to Juarez via Mexico. They keep cancelling or delaying flights without any explanation. The reason for cancellation isn't very important to me unless it is force majeure. We did check at the airport and nothing was going on. Like the plane in Lima was supposed to be late, because of bad weather disruptions in Mexico City, which upon checking in Mexico City appeared to not be true.

### "two months try to have my suitcase back"
Vancouver to Bogota via Mexico. I traveled with interjet with my 7 year old son. they gave me an itinerary but the flight did not leave at the time they said from Vancouver the flight was delayed two hours when I arrived at my first stop in Mexico city one of my bags never appeared the people that work there never wanted to help me they ignored my questions all the time and since it was late the flight from Vancouver couldn't reach my flight from Mexico city to Bogotá and with my little son we had to wait all day to have another flight but this flight was delayed again for another hour. When I arrived in Colombia to know what would happen with my suitcase the only thing they told me was to wait 21 days that they will call me when they can get my suitcase, they called me to told me to go to the airport for my suitcase but when I get there my suitcase was not there and nobody say something about it I have almost two months try to have my suitcase back but this is more hard now because they don't answer my calls.

### "fight attendants were not caring at all"
Cancun to Vancouver. Terrible service on the flight. Right after take off, all three flight attendants disappeared for three (3) hours! My daughter had a high fever, so we needed water for her, but they were gone. At least ten seats had the crew call button on, but they wouldn't show up. After a couple of hours, people started looking for them in the plane, they were not at the back, not at the front. At the end, some passengers knocked on captains cabin door, and finally one flight attendant came out. She quickly turned off some of the call buttons without asking people what they wanted! Unbelievable, but it happened to us. The fight attendants were not caring at all. Will not fly with Interjet again.

### "Absolute worst customer service"
Cancun to Toronto . Airline wrongfully charged me $360 for checked luggage that did not board the plane. I had to pay this amount the second day in order to get my luggage. (We had 9 pieces) They did not refund the amount for the service which was not provided. Upon calling customer service several times, after every single agent saying “I’m sorry I understand but there is nothing we can do”. Absolute worst customer service, and rude agents.

### "customer service is a joke"
New York to Mexico City. Interjet had a glitch in checking my bag. I checked 1 bag which was within the weight restrictions. They charged me $104 dollars. When I pointed it out the the agent, she called the customer service number and they mentioned that it happened a few times and it would be taken care of. I checked my bank statement and they have taken out the $104 from my account. Trying to contact their customer service is a joke. I now have to file a complaint with my bank in order to get my money, because I can't get in contact with anyone from customer service.

### "customer service is horrible "
Chicago to Guadalajara. Their customer service is horrible and they are hungry for money. We were informed that the policy is that we can change or cancel the fly and save our money if we call before the flight a few hours before the flight my elder grandmother lost her passport at the last minute and we were on the phone for 7 hours trying to come in contact with them they kept telling us that they were too busy and that we were and hold their website says 24 hours this is not true and the next thing when I tried to call they told us that our flight was lost and that they were going to keep our money this is horrible and I spoke to many people and they kept telling me the same thing and I told them that this was wrong what they were doing and that they shouldn't advertise that they're website is 24 hours and that we can call before the flight if they're not available. We even went to the airport and staff was unprofessional, mocking our situation and when I asked her name, she says "your problems are not my fault".

### "We would fly you again"
México City to Puerto Vallarta. After reading reviews I was a little concerned about this flight. Checkin at México City Airport was seamless with an agent that spoke excellent English as my wife and I do not speak Spanish. The airline allows a generous 25 kg of checked luggage and 10kg of take on luggage per person at no extra cost. The Delta flight to Mexico City from New York charged USD30 per checked bag and we paid for Comfort plus seats which offered a few inches more leg room than regular economy. The biggest surprise was entering the cabin a very new aircraft with the most room in economy I have encountered in years and years. I fly a lot for work in Australia and Qantas should look at this airlines seat configuration as it sets what I believe is a gold standard of what economy should be, not like being cramped in like battery hens. The flight was smooth and fast the crew friendly and the service offered for a low cost airline at no additional cost for a short 59 minute flight consisting of drink and snack more than adequate. Bravo Interjet We would fly you again.

### "the poorest in both services"
Not Verified |  San José to Montreal. The only thing I can say about this airline is they are the poorest in both services, In condition of the airplane and customer service, I am using different airline more than 7 times a year business related going to different countries and am able to book my seat online 24 hrs ahead of time but interjet is the only airline they technically shove the seats in to their passengers without them knowing it and then when you try to change it to another normal seat, not even business or first class they charge you for that. They won't give you this chance to choose your seat at the desk in the airport or online prior to flight. It seems that it is their way of getting money just by booking randomly and rubbing people if they need to seat next to their loved ones or to change it to another regular economy class seat. In the customer service department, they are so rude and they just repeating like a parrot without giving any solution that it is airline policy yes this is their policy to rub you so be aware.

### "does not care about customer service"
I can’t believe how run down and disgusting this airplane both going from Las Vegas to Guadalajara and returning Guadalajara to Las Vegas. I thought that it was a fluke that the airplane was damaged going, but returning it was the same. Broken seats, broken trays, torn or ripped seats. The lavatories do not have paper towels, toilet paper, or Kleenex, when I asked the flight attendant she said “sorry”, but then again that was going and returning. This is their standard operating procedure, how sad. Once in flight the attendants are handing out hot soda and when asked for ice, they ask “do you have a thermos”? When I told her no, she handed me 3 ice cubes in a plastic cup and was upset. Interjet is cheap , and certainly does not care about customer service or integrity within the airline community.

### "Terrible service. Terrible company."
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Costa Rica via Mexico City. My trip is booked for October 28th. I booked my flight and paid for all of my hotels in Costa Rica. Then interjet bumped my flights 3 months after the booking so I have two 25 hour layovers in Mexico City (1 each way) and I get back to Vancouver too late to take a ferry. That’s 3 extra nights of hotels than the original budget called for. Interjet and flighthub have sent me back and forth all day, refusing to take any responsibility for the increased costs. Interjet has put me on hold to “speak to a manager” and then hung up 3 times. 5 hours on hold and maybe 30 minutes actually talking to useless agents and no resolution. The “Canadian” agents are all ESL so they can’t understand the problem half of the time. What a joke. Terrible service. Terrible company. And I haven’t even flown with them yet.

### "never use Interjet again"
This airline is the worst, all flights were delayed for about 3 hours and also Eunice one the airline's desk helper in Mexico DF was disrespectful and rude she also said that she had the power to stop us to take our flight back to USA. I will never use Interjet again.

### "they have completely been ignoring me"
After standing at baggage claim for an hour, Interjet informed us that they intentionally left many suitcases in another country and that they would give us paperwork to fill out in order to send the luggage to wherever our final destination/home. This resulted in many of us missing connecting flights. After 12 hours stuck in an airport, having to buy and book my own flight out after they refused to do it for me. It was not until 16 days later that I was notified that they are sending my suitcase to a city over two hours away from. During this entire process, they have completely been ignoring me and refusing to send me any of the compensation forms for the numerous expenses that began to accumulate due to Interjet. I have traveled the world, on numerous airlines and worked with hundreds of various customer services and Interjet is by far, the worst customer service I have ever received. It has now been nearly a month and I have consistently been contacting them regarding these compensation forms and they have been nothing but silent. I will ensure that no friend, family, stranger or anyone I meet will ever even consider flying with an airlines like Interjet.

### "they make promises but don't deliver"
Not Verified |  This airline was by far the worst experience I've had with any business. To set the record straight, we didn't actually fly with them, we were scheduled to fly back from Leon Mexico to LAX in June but in May they called and cancelled our flight, They offered a flight alternative that would have taken over 12 hours to get home at nearly 1.00 am in the morning, We are seniors and I knew my husband wasn't up to this schedule so I requested a refund. After about 15 minutes of discussion, they finally agreed. Well here it is almost September and I still haven't received my money. I've called five times, three of them being on hold for over one hour and sent countless emails and they make promises but don't deliver. I've had to send my banking information twice so I know that's not the problem. Please travelers do yourself a favor and read their reviews before you book, I sure wish I had!

### "not acceptable and very unprofessional"
We arrived yesterday at 11:30 pm (08/18/2019) at JFK airport with a delayed flight from Mexico city (interjet 2992). After customs, we arrived at the luggage carousel around 12:30am. One of our luggage was missing so we looked for a representative from Interjet to file the report. We waited for 1:30 but no representative was present. We asked for help from other company representatives and the arrival carousel bag manager confirmed us that the one Interjet representatvie has left long ago and suggested to call them. We called and were told that it was too late and to try to call again tomorrow morning. This morning, after several unsuccessful calls, we were told to go back to the airport. I finally went back to JFK where no representative was present. Once again other company reps had to help us. I waited 3h+ for the next arrival flight from Interjet and finally stumbled upon a random Interjet hostess. I strongly beleive that this is not acceptable and very unprofessional. It is their responsibility to take care of any lost luggage. As no representative was around (purposely or not) it was impossible for us to file any report at any point.

### "mean, nasty and unpleasant"
Medellin to Mexico City. This was my first Interjet flight. The only good news is the flight was on time and we landed safely. On the negative side I can honestly say I have never seen a crew on any airline so mean, nasty and unpleasant. I'm a 60 year old guy and asked for some water late in the flight. The flight attendant snapped at me and said no, we have no water. They did not distribute landing cards before landing. I had to ask for them as I left the flight. They gave me one of the two required. I saw them in customs and called them out on all of this - their mean nasty attitudes, unwillingness to pass out customs forms. I don't need to be abused by these people. If it was my company, they all would be fired already for their lack of professionalism and disgraceful behavior. Amazingly when I walked them out on their nastiness they agreed with me and acknowledged it. Also, their website is disingenuous - they talk about wifi connectivity video screens, audio all on 'some' flights. There is zippo. Unfortunately my return flight is in Interjet but I will never fly them again and could not recommend.

### "some of my valuables were gone"
Puerto Vallarta to via Dallas via Mexico City. I payed for my luggage to be taken from Puerto Vallarta directly to Dallas so I wouldn’t have to be carrying it around but little did I think that this would’ve happened. So when I got to the airport in Dallas tx I noticed my bag was opened as if someone went looking through it and when I got home and started putting up my things I noticed some of my valuables were gone. I called the airline but they said that I couldn’t do anything cause I didn’t report it at the Dallas  airport but who would’ve thought they could steal from you at an airport.

### "a plane with cheap seats"
Not Verified |  So my plane had been scheduled for 4.15pm, however it got delayed, no problem we weren’t in a hurry. It gets rescheduled for 6pm. We wait till 6pm and get in the plane. For the next 2 hours we take 2 circles around JFK. After we get back to where we started they tell us that they have a “mechanical problem”. Now at this point I’m pretty mad since they made us sit down for 2 hours. They reschedule it for 11. We wait till 11 and they say they are unable to fix the problem so they will try to get us another plane so we can get on with our trip. They say however that they confirm that it will be at 1245. Now everyone waiting is furious as would anyone since we waited so long and the fact that most of us have been in the airport for now 10 hours waiting for the plane. We then get another plane and instead of giving us a decent plane for all the trouble they cause us, they gave us a plane with cheap seats. All they did for us that whole time was give us soda and chips to make up for it which is why I’m giving the rating a 1/10 and not a 0/10.

### "feels more like a cheap bus company"
Bogota to Las Vegas via Mexico City. I usually use low cost airlines already knowing their limitations, but this one exceeds every possible (negative) expectation, it is truly a nightmare. They do not have web checkin for most of their international hubs (including Bogotá - yes, in 2019), so be ready for a 2 hour line to check in, even if you only have carry on. The line in Bogota was so ridiculous across the terminal that everybody was just shocked. My two flights were delayed (Bogota-Mexico City; Mexico City-Las Vegas) using the good old technique of delaying, delaying, delaying not to cancel the flight and leaving passengers all night in the terminal with no food or accommodation. In Mexico City the situation was the most ridiculous I have ever seen in all those years of flying: the flight departed with more than 2 hours delay but in the TVs showing the status the departing hour had been changed so it would show "On Time". I thought I was crazy, but no, when inside the plane the pilot even apologised for the delay, so Interjet just used some nasty tricks at Mexico City airport. Maybe to Interjet standards that is not that absurd, considering how many reviews describe employees of the company asking for bribes. The boarding was absolutely chaotic: the gate was changed and the flight departed from the same gate where another flight was already boarding. There was a mix of lines with Interjet staff just screaming the destinations as they were not properly indicated on the screens. When inside the plane, my seat was 28C but to my surprise (and to some others 'lucky' few), the last row of the plane was 26. They told us to stay in the back close to the bathroom and made us wait, wait, wait until boarding was complete. Then we were approached by a woman who clearly hated her job who started screaming how many of us were travelling alone. The ones who were alone were pushed to a seat and a group of 6 apparently had to leave the plane. One guy said he had bought an aisle seat and the woman just told him to call the airline and complain. Security-wise, it is also the worst I have ever seen. During the boarding process, staff of the airline and of maintenance were leaning on the engine of the plane, completely careless about any security standard. The crew had no control of the passengers and didn't care if people were just walking around during take-off and landing. The airport and plane staff is clearly overworked and unhappy. It is absolutely nothing similar to other low costs such as Spirit or Norwegian, where you receive limited but efficient service. Interjet feels more like a cheap bus company that decided to become an airline. One positive aspect: legroom is higher than the average; probably they just left the sets of the original old used planes they bought to save money. Please spend some extra money and don't fly with them.

### "disgusted with this airline"
Cancun to San Francisco. I am insulted and disgusted with this airline. Delayed once, twice, three times thus far this evening and they have the audacity to tell us it’s because they have no crew.

### "They are the worst airline!"
They are the worst airline! I will never fly interjet again. Let me begin by saying we paid for a straight flight but a week later they change the flight There was a 2 hour layover coming and going. They lost our checked bags going from JFK to Mexico city to Mexico Cancun even after we asked multiple interjet staff If we need to pick the luggage up and register it again. So there we were in Cancun on our honeymoon with no clothes for 2 days straight. When we called we could not get anyone who spoke English and when we finally did he told us it's only been 48 hours and then once the bag was found they wanted us to come pick it up or pay them to drop it off. After a lot of back and forth they agreed to bring us our bag at no charge. On the way home from our trip Cancun to Mexico City, and Mexico City to JFK we were told that we needed to go get our bags so we did. When we got down stairs we were told by a different staff that the bags are carrying over. Because we had went down stairs like we were told to we were not allowed back up stairs and had to go through a long line of security again. We did not know where we were going so we asked a interjet staff representative. They helped us get to our destination then asked us for money. The guy said my time is money and told us to get him some money out of the atm. We gave him nothing and kept walking.

### "not yet received a refund"
Not Verified |  I have not yet received a refund for a canceled flight I ordered a flight in February and the flight was canceled by the company in May and since then they have not answered the phone / email. And when you can get them on the phone after 50 minutes waiting, not every representative can speak English and really do not communicate well and transfer you from one representative to another and tell you to call a phone number that is exactly the number you called. You really have to beware of them like fire and not order them tickets, do not order directly through them and not through a travel agent. They have no service after you paid. More than two months after canceling the flight and the card because of their problem has not yet received the full refund. It's a pity that taking money they know how to take quickly but when they have to make a full refund they are delayed. They should be erased from the airlines that sell tickets.

### "still waiting for my refund"
Having bought a ticket, making plans according to the itinerary agreed with Interjet Airlines, having to cancel due to the fact that 2 weeks prior to flying Interjet Airlines made a change of wait in my stop in Mexico City extending from 2 hours to 6, sabotaging my hotel reservation and meeting with the rest of the family. Having to comply with providing 'Bank Information', submitting front and back copies of the bank card I used to pay my ticket! I had to purchase another ticket and was promised by Interjet Airlines to refund my money! After numerous emails, 5 phone calls, I'm still waiting for my refund already 2 months into this fraud.

### "still waiting for my refund"
❎ Not Verified | I bought a ticket to fly from Houston to Ixtapa on a family retreat. Made the hotel reservation according to the itinerary agreed with the airline. 2 weeks prior to the scheduled flight, Interjet made changes to my stop in Mexico City that instead of waiting 2 hours would be extended to 6 hours which would sabotage my schedule plans! I cancelled the trip and bought another ticket with a different airline that suited perfectly. Internet in accordance with consumers rights agreed to make a refund my money! After numerous e-mails and 4 phone contacts to 4 different representatives with every time averaging a waiting time that exceeds an hour, besides complying with their demand of submitting front and back copies of the card used to purchase the ticket, they also demand the bank name and account number. I'm still waiting for my refund!

### "disgusted with this company"
Not Verified |  I never even got the chance to fly Interjet. They changed my flight a month before my trip and I was unable to make that flight because it was not comparable at all. I purchased a flight from LAX to PV that was 3hrs long and they tried to offer me an 11hr flight and instead leaving the night before. There was no way I would take an 11hr flight over a 3hr flight, so I asked for a refund in May and I have yet to receive it. Every time I call the airline I get hung up on or transferred to another department. I am beyond disgusted with this company.

### "don’t recommend them at all"
Not Verified |  Back in March I purchased my vacation tickets for my whole family of 4. Two weeks before the date we supposed to fly they canceled our city of destination and times of flying, they didn’t left me with no options so we ended it up getting tickets with American Airlines (I should of done this since the first time in March) May 1st I started a claim for a my whole refund of $1,150. A month later I called them to see where was it or what was going on? And they told me that they need it my bank statement with all my personal information including the bank info to proceed with my refund! By this time I was really irritated already, because nobody but nobody contact me (email or phone) to tell me that, and it’s incredible the way they treat me, every call I make to them easily the wait it’s of 2 hours to more. It’s been 2 weeks that I send them my bank statement (which I really didn’t like the idea) and I called them yesterday and their answer to my question of “where my refund is”? Was: that the department of refunds haven’t process the refund yet and they don’t know the reason! I was like transfer me to that department or to a Supervisor, incredibly they told me that there’s no way that they can transfer me because there’s no filter to do that and that a supervisor was not available at the time! I don’t recommend them at all And I hope I get my money back.

### "experience was ridiculous"
Mexico City to New York JFK. I would never recommend anyone to ever fly this airline. When booking the flight I understood this was a budget airline but the whole experience was ridiculous. They had ONE working bathroom the whole flight and it was disgusting! The flight attendants were rude and one even threatened to kick my father off the plane after mistaking him for someone else and she didn’t even apologize even after realizing they mistook him for someone else but I guess to them as long as you’re Indian we all look alike.

### "never going with Interjet again"
My family and I initially had a nonstop flight from Puerto Vallarta to Los Angeles. Two weeks before our trip I was notified that Interjet changed and cancelled all non-stop flights from PVR to LAX and they stuck us on another flight that had a layover in Mexico City of 1.5 hrs. Nightmare started when they first delayed our flight by an hour. Instead of 535 they told us 635pm. Ok fine... we may have made it. But then, they increased the layover by an hour and a half. We didn't leave until 815pm. By that time they told me verbatim that the connecting flight to LAX would not leave without us because there was 40 people om the same flight. Fast forward to Mexico City. Get off the plane and they left. We are now stuck at the airport in Mexico city at 11:35 pm and they won't compensate a hotel, they did offer a food credit but we are now stuck on a flight at 0715 the next morning. We are having to sleep in an airport. They told me I could go to a hotel (20 minutes away) pay for it myself and then get reimbursed by them but , I now have to check in at 415 am (4 hrs from now) , would have to pay for a taxi there and back and for what? I am never going with Interjet again! !

### "shoddy bus version of an airline"
Not Verified |  Interjet is the shoddy bus version of an airline. Firstly, as many other reviewers have said, two of my flights were cancelled without any sort of communication from Interjet. It took to me calling them and only then I discovered they were cancelled! The staff members do not have the professionalism or aptitude for their jobs. I almost missed two of my flights and in both situations there was a complete lack of urgency and care from the employees. At my connecting flight I was told, “relax americano”, when I only had 20 minutes to make my flight. It took to me cutting a line and running the entire length of CDMX to make my flight. I had no issues once on the flights but the attitude from all the staff left me with tremendous unease. Also one glass of water for a 5 hour flight?

### "my worst experience"
Mexico City to Dallas. Flying in interjet was my worst experience, they made me lose my flight by not providing the correct information and refused to give me a refund, and worst of all they lost my luggage and can’t recover it, Customer service takes around an hour for them to answer the phone. Igot no help from anyone and they still want me to drive back and they do nothing but wast my time. I recommend any other airline where customer service actually cares for the customer.

### "Don't fly Interjet"
Tuxtla Gutierrez to Mexico City. Booked this flight as American 8294, knowing it was operated by code share partner, but thought that meant as a Platinum AA member that I'd at least have an advocate in the case of problems. No!Flight into MEX was delayed as plane had to divert to Acapulco to refuel and missed our connection. Took 4 hours for Interjet to get us boarding passes for flight the next day and they never told us where our luggage was. Thanks to kind and trusting security agent we did get luggage retrieved. Had to overnight in airport hotel @$275. Applied to travel insurer for compensation, not to Interjet. All I need from Interjet is confirmation that flight was delayed 2 hours. It has been 6 weeks and they won't even respond. Emails say "we are glad to help you, under review". Phone is never answered. I've sent email requests once a week for over 2 months. AA told me they can't help me as it was an Interjet flight. They take no responsibility for their code share partner, even to communicate with them. Don't fly Interjet and don't think booking with a code share partner will get you any service from American.

### "trying to get refund for over a month"
Not Verified |  Was notified that direct flight from Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta  on May 6 was being delayed by more than 12 hours supposed to leave at 9:40 am arrive in PVR at 3 pm. New flight leaving at 11:30 pm from LAX landing in Mexico City at 3 am on 3/7/19, then leaving for Puerto Vallarta after 10 am on 10/7/19. Meaning I was losing who day of vacation, lodging, transportation, etc. Ended up booking another flight, and have been trying to get refund for over a month with no luck.

### "still haven’t gotten a refund"
Not Verified |  I booked my flight months before my travel date. Interjet calls to tell my flight has been canceled and I will get a refund and this was a month before my flight I said okay. It is June 3 and I still haven’t gotten a refund. Spoke to so many people and everyone is useless. Long waiting time and never getting my money back.

### "Worst experience ever"
Los Angeles to Tuxtla via Mexico City. Worst experience ever, never taking this airline again. I had a flight out of LAX at 23:20 which was cancelled within the hour. That of course meant I was losing my connecting flight from MEX to TGZ. Now I had a layover which was twice as long as before and meant that I would miss a day of my vacation plus pre-arranged airport transport. We board the connecting flight and after a few mins we are told there are issues with the door and that they have to deplane the first 4 rows of passengers, and we were in the first row of course! To make this review short, we arrived at our final destination after over 24 hrs of travel and I lost a day. I have reached out to their customer service department and still have not heard from them, I plan to never take this airline again.

### "worst experience ever"
Mexico City to New York. The worse airline ever. I don’t know why they schedule a flight when they are going to be late for boarding late for departing and late for arriving. The flight attendants have an attitude they don’t want to work there we are paying for the service and they are hire for it. The only good thing was the sandwiches and chips. The rest was a worst experience ever. They keep changing the gates number until boarding time which is an hour after the boarding according to the ticket information. They had us tuning from gate to gate and they are disorganized when boarding start they don’t call by zones.

### "Interjet never again"
Cancun to Juarez via Mexico City. Mexico city to Juarez flight Cancelled for no reason. Interjet Airlines are currently going through financial and personnel difficulties. Just read the current news to confirm. Forced to wait 13 hours until next available flight. Slept on the floor a few hours and walked around the airport like a zombie for most of the remaining hours. The Mexico city airport (terminal 1) is completely outdated and falling apart. No air conditioning, broken restrooms, foul smells in some areas, etc. I know now. I had 13 hours to walk around and see. LOL At the end of the whole unpleasant experience. There was No compensation, and No reimbursement. Interjet never again. Just pay a few more $ for a reliable airline.

### "It was a nightmare"
Guanajuato to Mexico City. The worst error I ever made choosing this airline. It was a nightmare. They charge for the luggage, and because I asked for another place in the plane at the front desk (after extra charge) they mark my boadding pass with several "SSS" so I was searched like I was transporting a ton of drugs in front of everyone, a 65 years old lady, nobody help you with the right information all they tell you is wrong or partial info. Due this I have to run four times the biggest airport I ever been. They didn't know what gate should be. The flight was delayed two hrs. Plus the seven hrs I spend for the connection to Miami. Finally when I get to the plain the crew was so, so rude . They wanted to put me in another seat and I was charged for that seat! So I spent from 5:00 am in the morning to 11:00pm finally I get home. With only apple juice and chips.

### "like Interjet for short flights"
Mexico City to Lima. I like Interjet for short flights within Mexico, but for flights of more than 5 hours it is exhausting (6 hours of flight plus an hour and a half delay already on board) and without an entertainment system. It's the first time I take such a long flight with them and I do not know if I would do it again. Me gusta Interjet, para vuelos cortos dentro de México, pero para vuelos de más de 5 horas es agotador (6 horas de vuelo más retraso de hora y media ya a bordo)!! y sin sistema de entretenimiento.. es la primera vez que tomo un vuelo tan largo con ellos y no sé si lo volvería a realizar...

### "fight to get the refund"
Mexico City to Obregon. Interjet cancelled both of my flights without any warning (I only found out when I happened to check the app). They rebooked both flights, for different locations and dates! I called and asked for a full refund, and they agreed. However, after several weeks of not receiving the refund, I called back - and they said it was marked as "processed" on their end! I now have to fight tooth and nail to try to get the refund. The same exact thing happened to my friend who was on the same flights, and he has to fight for his refund too (who knows if we'll succeed). Don't trust this airline. They will cancel your flights without any notice, and will refuse to refund you your money. Fly with any other airline instead.

### "insulted by staff in Mexico City"
Vancouver to Guatemala via Mexico City. My sister flying with our father ashes with all the paper work given by the funeral home here in Canada was insulted by INTERJET staff in Mexico City airport by asking her to put the ashes in check in luggage and saying the letter from funeral home have to be in a funeral urn when the letter stated ashes will be in an urn suitable to travel. My sister’s ordeal when for 3 hours crying and running at 5am by herself looking for a funeral urn to bring my dad’s ashes with her. Agents did nothing for her. Go to the city to buy one was their advise! Canadian officers when she left and check her Carry in luggage and saw the ashes and letter, offered her an apology and condolences. We put the complain but nobody takes responsibility about it.

### "flight was cancelled"
We had a flight from Chicago OHare on Monday 11/26 at 12am. Due to a big blizzard that happened the flight was cancelled. Interjet offered us with no hotel accommodations or a next day flight. Instead they left us on the floor of the airport and a flight three days later on Wednesday 11/28. We drove 3 hours to get to Chicago and they didn’t even care. It’s not their problem. So I cancelled the payment on my credit card since they refused to pay me back and booked with AeroMexico. Don’t use this company. They will send debt collections after you to collect for services that were never rendered.

### "Never flying here again"
Chicago to Guadalajara. Three tickets purchased. One for my grandfather who passed away the day we were scheduled to fly. Since this was an inconvenience to Interjet we had to pay an additional $600 to set up new flights. Not get our money back. Just pick new dates since we had lost a family member. They didn’t care and were happy to charge us additional money. Never flying here again.

### "never fly this airline again"
Houston to Mexico City. I’m flying to Mexico City after spending 4 days in Houston with a carry on which I was pleased with myself for packing seeing as though I will be gone a total of 8 days. Upon checking in with Interjet, I found that my carry on exceeded the allotted weight by 4lbs. I went back and forth with the check in staff and supervisor attempting to remove the 4lbs from my bag but couldn’t make it work. I put everything back in to pay the extra $30 fee and as I was checking in one of the attendants points to my bag and makes a joke in Spanish about the weight and he and a couple other attendants laugh with me standing there and the supervisor present. I think it’s customer service 101 to not say anything (albeit true) while the guest is right there. As a result I’ll never fly this airline again.

### "Utterly unacceptable"
Mexico City to New York. First the schedule changed from midnight to 3.50AM. I wasn’t told I could change my flight until 3 days before my flight when it was too late. Then I couldn’t check in online so called and was told I had to arrive 3 hrs early. Arrived and we were delayed 40mins - they wouldn’t give any update on delays. I was so late to work. Utterly unacceptable.

### "second leg was canceled"
Not Verified |  Thought I was getting a great deal when I bought tickets for $98 one-way going from Las Vegas to Cancún. When we arrived at the Las Vegas airport they said our second leg from Mexico City to Cancun was canceled. The ticket agents ticketed our luggage all the way to Cancún. Even though the flight was canceled and we ended up in Mexico City. I had to pay an extra $750 to a different airline to finish up our trip for five people. We didn’t get our luggage until after two days of our seven day vacation due Interjet error tagging luggage wrong. They did nothing to reimburse me for the airline tickets, or the additional $750 I had to pay for last minute changes through another airline because they canceled the second leg and couldn’t accommodate getting us to Cancún our destination. Do not fly this airline or you’re going to get a surprise on the day you travel with NO reimbursement AND it’ll cost you five times as much.

### "this airline made me furious"
Not Verified |  Cancun to Toronto. I will not fly with Interjet again. I have traveled extensively and am extremely easy going- but this airline made me furious. As per the previous reviewers comments, my husband and I were on the same flight and everything they said about the chaos of the check-in process was true. We stood in line from 2:30 pm to check in, and did not get to the check in desk until 4:50 pm (our flight was 4:55 pm). We were in reasonably good spirits assuming that because they had not processed such a large number of guests, that the flight could certainly not take off without us. (Wishful thinking only, the staff did not communicate with us at all). When we finally got to the check in desk, I put our 2 passports on the counter (with a sigh of relief). I was asked to back up while the Interjet staff and the Airport assistance worker processed an elderly couple in a wheelchair first. We stepped back, kind of laughing at our bad luck to wait so long just to have to wait a little longer, but totally understood because it was an elderly couple. Then the Interjet man and the Airport employee waved a younger couple over to the check in desk as well. Once the group was checked in, the employees then waved over more couples, with no apparent need for assistance. We noticed the first couple paying off the employee. The couple had paid the airport employee to get them from the back of the line to the check in counter, by pairing them with an elderly couple of no relation. The employee then thought he could do it again with another group of young people. This was enraging because after nearly 3 hours in line they were trying to process people who had arrived much later, for a flight that was departing an hour after ours. The Interjet employee would clearly be able to see that the group was not flying together or to the same destination. I was absolutely disgusted by this. Will never recommend this airline to anyone, they put customers who bribe ahead of honest customers.

### "a horrible experience"
Toronto to Cancun. This was our first experience with Interjet, and will be our last. My husband and I had a horrible experience with the check-in process at the Cancún airport. Interjet clearly did not properly staff the counter, nor was your staff correctly trained. It was highly inefficient, and the lack of communication exacerbated the issues significantly. We arrived to the airport at 2:30pm for our 4:55pm flight. We were unable to checkin online for the flight, and were trying to find out if everyone had to wait in the passenger baggage check line, or if it was only for passengers checking bags. We spoke to four Interjet representatives, two said the line was only for customers with baggage, and that we could checkin with the Kiosk. The other two said everyone needs to wait in the line. I speak both English and Spanish fluently, the representatives were unable to provide a clear answer in either language. My husband went to try the kiosk to no avail while I waited in line because Interjet employees could not agree on the process. It is not acceptable in 2019 not to have an online check-in. This is a standard feature in the airline industry, and I am not aware of any other company who does not offer online check-in. The line was moving extremely slow, it took over 12 minutes to check in one person. People from Mexico traveling to Canada were given additional forms upon arriving at the desk, rather than providing the forms ahead of time to reduce the time in the line. Finally, at approximately 4:00pm, they opened a "Toronto only" line. There was no one from the airline to help redirect the lines, it was very confusing, and no communication was given. Other "Canada" lines were handling passengers for other flights that were leaving later, instead of handling the Toronto passengers as a priority. No communication was given regarding whether our flight would be delayed. I checked the website, and it said the flight was departing on time. When we finally made it towards the front of the line, after approximately an hour and 45 minutes, I tried to ask one of the customer service representatives if the flight would be delayed to accommodate the late check-in process. She said the flight would not be delayed, but they would wait for people to check-in. I asked her if she could make an announcement to let everyone know, she told me "No, there are too many people. How would I do that? I asked her to make an announcement over the sound system, and she said "No, I have already told you what you need to know. She was very rude and unprofessional. Their staff's lack of communication greatly exacerbated the issues with the check-in process. People were frantic, and started cutting the lines. At one point someone cut from the back of the line, people were chanting "¡Fuera! And the authorities had to come over to the Interjet designated area to try and calm down the patrons. We arrived on the plane at approximately 5:20pm. There was another 40 minute delay waiting for the General Declaration. No announcement was made until almost 6:00pm as to why were were still waiting. Interjet was the only one at the Cancún airport with significant lines. Every other airline was properly staffed and handling their customers at a much faster rate. Their staff's lack of organization, communication, and professionalism caused all of these issues.

### "it was a great flight"
Tuxtla to Mexico City. Because of the bad reviews we were really worried but it was a great flight. On time, clean plane, even with the cheapest fare you have one checked baggage included, all the announcements were made in English, free drink & snack during the flight. Plus you’ve got plenty of leg room and the fares are cheap! Totally recommended!

### "It was so disappointing"
Los Angeles to Cancun flight. The cleanness of the airplane was very questionable. -he captain was not updating the flight info. We had no idea where we are and when we get there. The crew were unprofessional and unhappy. In fact two of them very rude and throwing out snacks on my kids lap instead of handing it to us! For a 5 hours flight, they had no blanket and no meal to even purchase. It was so disappointing.

### "never saw the bag again"
Not Verified |  On our return trip home to Canada flying from Cancun - Interjet lost our family luggage. We paid a handling fee on checking the bag and we never saw the bag again. Over the past 3 weeks since losing the bag we have tried speaking over the phone, constantly redirected & put on hold. We were lied to, a representative stated that luggage isn’t deemed lost until it’s been 21 days missing, after I found that the website says 8 days. Very few of the reps speak English. We’ve tried emailing multiple times. Not one person has been able to answer our questions! Still waiting to hear about compensation for the luggage and compensation for items we’ve had to replace out of necessity since getting home.

### "worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever. I had a flight booked from JFK airport in New York to Cancun set to depart on March 17, 2019 at 6:55 am. Less than 24 hours before that time, I went to double check my boarding pass and check in online and saw that, with no prior notification, my flight had gotten changed to 4:40 pm that same day, and was going to Mexico City instead of Cancun. Then I would have to wait at the Mexico City airport for nearly 12 hours to catch a 7:35 am flight to Cancun the next day, causing me to lose an entire day of my vacation. Interjet sent me no prior email to notify me of this change, if I had not went to check myself I never would have known. On top of that, when I called customer service, I was put on hold for over 3 hours the first call, and hung up on three times.

### "Never ever again"
New York to Cancun. Worst airline ever. Changed our departure day without us knowing and just put us in a really bad position missing vacation, wasting money and the worst thing they did it without us knowing. Just changed our departure date for the next business day, probably because they oversold or some other problem. Never ever again.

### "was my worst experience"
Not Verified |  Cancun to New York JFK. It was my worst experience for my 30 years of traveling. On 13 March I had to fly from Cancun to New York JFK on 6:15PM and I was at airport in 5:00 PM , after it took 30 minutes procedures at Car Rental to give back the rented car. When I wanted to checkin baggage, the Interjet staff told me that i can’t fly today and I an going to miss the flight beacuse the flight closes 1 hour before the flying scheduled. Never heard something like this , then I was told to ask the superviser. And he told me the same,  and I told him it’s still one hour left and you still didn’n start boarding and this airport is small. He said that it’s almost closed and there is no time to make prepare some migration documents (imagine Migration docs wile i was entering as tourist and i wanted to leave) and didnt want to help anymore, then they wanted me to sell two tickets for 900 dollar. Of course i found on the internet the next flight with Delta and the two tickets cost 389 dollars. So i had to stay all night in the airport and then spend some 100 dollar more to eat drink etc, so Interjet made my vacation terrible.

### "our experience is nightmare"
Not Verified |  To start off our trip down was 1 hour delayed. Then on the flight the flight attendant ignored me. So much so that my husband had to order my drinks twice or i wouldn't have been served refreshment. The on our flight home the only word that can describe our experience is nightmare. Beware if you are using this airline. They treat their customers terribly. Our flight home was cancelled an hour before we we're supposed to fly home. When we were at the airport waiting no explanation was given and we were told it could be days until we could get a flight home. We had no other choice then to book another flight home with another airline. Once home we requested a refund for a flight they cancelled and we have been told we won't get one because the flight was cancelled due to "weather" and their only obligation was to provide us with an alternate flight home. Even if that flight was days later? So our options were to stay good knows where in Cancun for multiple days waiting to get home with both kids or pay out of our own pocket and get a flight with another airline. All other airlines had no problem flying into Vancouver with the "weather" but Interjet later said it was due to bad weather. This is their way of being able to cancel a flight and not have to reimburse their patrons. Please can someone tell me how this is an acceptable way to treat customers who paid for a service they never received? Not to mention that we didn't receive our baggage until a week later.

### "great big thanks to her"
Mérida to Toronto via Mexico City. We had a ticket with the wrong name. Some how we got to Mérida with the wrong name but when we were on the way home it was caught. We were unable to call the help number and get it changed. We were fortunate enough to have an agent at Interjet that helped us navigate the situation and get us home. A great big thanks to her, she is a keeper for any airlines. Thank You Teresa.

### "dismissed our complaints"
Acapulco to Houston via Mexico City. First encounter of how shoddy Mexico City airport is and the poor customer service interjet provide: Initial flight was outward Houston to Acapulco via Mexico City. We were told to collect our luggage at Mexico City for domestic leg. Interjet staff gave wrong information for luggage collection and subsequent inquiries told us the luggage would automatically forward with the flight. It did not, however a helpful employee at Acapulco arranged the luggage for a later flight so we waited just 3 hrs. Second encounter with Mexico City airport: the return journey had lessons learnt, this time luggage would be collected as needed, however we were told it would automatically forward to Houston flight. On arriving at Mexico City I asked the first interjet employee I saw whether luggage would be forwarded and also where we should go for connecting flight to Houston. She confirmed luggage situation and told us to wait near gate 28 for updates. What she failed to say was that flight updates were never going to appear on terminal screens. The flight status remained gate B then gate G which implies no gate allocated. We did not hear any announcement or final call and until the flight had departed (late), unaware a gate had been allocated. Interjet duty manager Rosario Lopez was totally indifferent and gave the impression it was our fault for not realising the chaos that is México City airport. Check-in desk agent  said everyone knows this airport is terrible, and was apologetic for our plight but was unable to help with any resolution as his manager had dismissed our complaints. If you want customer service you should pay more and fly with a professional airline.

### "anger customers to increase revenue"
Guatemala to Mexico City. I experienced a disturbing event checking in for my return flight on Interjet Guatemala/Mexico city. NDYZYQ. At check in the woman said I would have to buy a return ticket to Mex. on Feb. 14. I explained I live in Guatemala and am returning home. I must go to Mexico every 90 for a new tourist visa. I don’t need this ticket. She said I can’t board without the ticket. I will speak to a supervisor, I said, which is a young, arrogant man. He said you must buy this ticket. I said no. After arguing for 5 minutes, and the flight was boarding, I bought a ticket from the nearby Interject ticket office at the Mex. city airport. A ticket I didn’t need, didn’t want and at a higher than normal price. When I arrived at immigration in Guatemala City, I explained what happened and immigration told me this ticket is not required. Interjet does this on their own. Why? They anger customers to increase revenue? I tried twice to call customer service, once in the US and once in Guate. Each time I was disconnected. Apparently Interject doesn’t want to speak to clients. Other travelers have complained about this crass ruse. It would cost me $35 to change the ticket. I often fly Interjet to Mexico and I’ve never before been required to buy an exit ticket to enter Guatemala.

### "service was beyond abysmal"
Cancun to Vancouver. The airline inexplicably canceled our flight (apparently due to weather, though no other carriers canceled their flights to the same destination). It then rebooked us four days later. We were forced to either buy a new flight home or spend 4 days stranded with a young child in a different country. The customer service was beyond abysmal. Will never, ever book with this airline again.

### "No problem whatsoever"
Montreal to Huatulco via Mexico city. After reading all negative reviews on this site, I was afraid to fly Interjet. I had forgotten to read reviews before I booked. But I was happily surprised. No problem whatsoever with either delays, impoliteness from personnel, etc. We found that the legroom was one of the best, actually the best, you get in an economy airline and we fly very often to different places. The staff was polite. Service also good. Sandwich provided ok, but what do you expect on economy flight! Ground staff also polite. I guess you get the treatment you deserve, treat them nice, they will treat you nice. I hesitate to recommend since reading all the bad experiences, but ours was great.

### "worst airline ever"
New York to Cancun. The worst airline ever! So much miscommunication and nobody know what they are doing! Very disappointing and will never fly with them again.

### "they chose to cancel it"
Dallas to Zihuatanejo via Mexico City. On Jan. 2, I was supposed to return home  via Mexico City. Interjet cancelled the first leg (Ixtapa to Mex City) of my return trip to Dallas because of foggy conditions in Mexico City for a few hours. They did not just delay the flight; they chose to cancel it. They said that Interjet has no responsibility because fog is not Interjet's fault, so they did not offer me an alternate flight to return home or paid for my lodging, etc. They will not refund me for the flight they cancelled. I had to find my own  alternate flights on other airlines for me and 3 other family members. The incident cost me $3,000 and an extra travel day.

### "Unbelievably poor flight crew"
Not Verified |  Guadalajara to San Francisco. On time and courteous ground staff managing the many lines queuing for check in. Boarded efficiently. Cabin crew giggling at each other when another passenger being given a bag for illness. Didn’t check back on passenger or provide any support. 2 hours in no cabin service - inquiry made - due to turbulence - we had not noticed anything unusual or exceptional turbulence. Asked for a glass of water. Provided begrudgingly. Service to cabin commenced 1 hour 45 mins prior to landing. No smiles, no customer service, no positive representation of the brand they work for. Giggling among selves but no smiles for customers. Toilet - no tissues or toilet paper or soap in dispenser when I attended. Informed cabin staff - glared at me! Unbelievably poor flight crew.

### "uncaring and not helpful"
Not Verified |  I am appalled at the way Interjet handled my case. I was among the hundreds of people affected by the closing of the airport was in Tijuana on December 21. As a result of this chaos, I was unable to fly out of Tijuana, Went back to United States and flew via Delta to my destination. Today, I tried to change my flight back and Interjet refused to work with me and wanted to charge me four times more than what I paid for my ticket origin ally. Staff are uncaring and not helpful.

### "going against their policy"
Las Vegas to El Salvador with connection in Mexico City. I forgot to mention that the airline offers to check in 2 pieces of luggage for free but when I arrived at check in at the airport they charged me for one piece of luggage. Completely going against their policy. They also weigh every single bag you carry to charge you more.

### "never use this airline again"
Las Vegas to El Salvador via Mexico city. I had a bad experience when my Luggage was ransacked and many of my items were stolen from luggage. I contacted the airline but the phone number could not be dialed. I emailed them several times customer support and corporate and I never heard from them. I am still waiting to hear from them. Bad customer service. I would never use this airline again.

### "delayed for more than 6 hours"
Not Verified |  Havana to Cancun. Flight was delayed for more than 6 hours. We lost the whole day in Havana airport that day. When the plane finally took off, there was no explanation why it was delayed for so long. None of the other airlines that day had delays even to the same destination that we were travelling to. Only interjet flights were delayed. When I called customer service for compensation they said it was due to weather conditions and there is no compensation in this case. We had internet and it was clear sky with little wind in Havana and Cancun (destination) and again no other flights were delayed.

### "would not recommend"
My flight was from Monterrey to Mexico City and Mexico City to Toronto. The worst part was ground service in Mexico City, it was an international flight but there was no English announcement when I was waiting for the plane. even though the plane was delayed, there was no update from ground service. When I asked something, the staff was very rude. I will never fly with this airline again and would not recommend to other people.

### "No complaints at all"
Monterrey to Mexico City. The flight attendants were amazing and the flight was smooth. Enough space between seats. No tricks trying to overcharge. No complaints at all.

### "Never travel with Interjet"
Los Angeles to Mexico. Never travel with Interjet. I missed a wedding because of their delays. First they told me there was a twenty minutes delay. Then it went to two hours. Trust me, look for alternatives.

### "recommend this airline"
Mexico City to Puerto Vallarta. Half the cost of Aeromexico alternative as baggage is included on internal flights even on a light fare (which I bought). Checked in online using the app, queued 10 mins for bag drop off, delayed take off of 30 mins due to traffic at MXC but great service on flight, snack and drinks included, got a refill on my drinks too. Can't speak to other negative reviews but highly recommend this airline for internal Mexican flights.

### "milk you for extra cash"
Not Verified |  Cancun to Los Angeles. Delayed more than twice, they make you stand in line for more that 3 hours and treat you like they are doing you a favor. They will try the hardest to milk you for extra cash.

### "never fly with this airline"
Mexico City to Merida. A friend and I flight from Los Angeles over Mexico City to Merida. The flight from AX to Mexico City was ok (only 45 min delay). When we arrived in Mexico City our flight to Merida stand on time but no gate was given. After we ask what gate we have they say we need to ask in 30 minutes again. This happens 3 times. After this the only says 8h they don’t know when the flight will start and at 3am they canceled it. On all websites and Info it stand on time. We go after it was canceled to the counter and get a flight 48hrs later, we get no money back or the money for the hotel. We want to go to Merida only for a weekend so we ask for a flight back to LAX, only answer where we need to buy the tickets and can’t change the Flight from Merida to LAX. I will never fly with this airline.

### "disaster of an experience"
New York JFK to Cancun. Worst airline ever! I took a 700am flight jfk to Cancun. First of all, they weigh all of your hand luggage which they do not make evident anywhere on the app/website So in the end your typical size carry on must be checked in. I have an AWAY brand of luggage and have never in my life had it weighed on any airline in the us. But I saw that I wasn’t the only one. Everyone needed to check their carryons. I even showed the manager that it’s not written anywhere on the app about the baggage regulations. Which he agreed is not right of them. When I told the manager that I need my medications inside my bag he continued to badger me asking what type of medications I had. This is illegal especially since I showed I was traveling with a doctors note. It is none of his business especially with a doctors note. Finally, I make it to security to learn that Interjet does not accept TSA precheck even when showing a physical global entry card. Practically unheard of these days. Once I get checked through security they take my bag to the side and ask me to follow them so I took my luggage and followed them for further screening. What I didn’t realize at this time was that my garment bag containing a gown for my cousins wedding was still in the machine. After getting inspected i continue to the gate for my flight . Once on the airplane I went into a panic realizing that I left my garment bag at security. Security was just a one minute walk away as terminal 7 is extremely small at jfk. I told the staff and she said I can not get off the airplane. I even asked her to see if she can page someone to see if anyone claimed it and she responded with “I don’t know how to”. Finally a man came over and said that they have my garment bag and someone can bring it. I hugged him I was so happy. Then the manager, the same one who gave me issues for my carry on saw me and said no one would be able to bring it to me and I won’t be able to run and get it. Without any explanation. He told me That I either get off the plane and miss my flight or leave my gown behind. I was hysterically crying since when I asked them if another flight would be leaving jfk that day they said “I don’t know”. It was rude and unprofessional. So I had to make the decision to get off of the airplane. They immediately handed my garment bag outside of the gate. Which is absurd since they could have easily brought it to me the entire time. In the time they fought me and answered with “I don’t know” and “no” they could have easily handed me the bag. In the end interjet had no flights leaving that day so I was forced to spend $800 on a one way ticket JetBlue flight since i couldn’t miss the wedding. I am so beyond disgusted. The best part of it all is on my JetBlue flight someone forgot their cellphone at the gate and the flight crew went to get it. Now that’s a kind airline! No one complained and we still got to our destination in time. Interjet is the worst airline ever. Save yourself from the agony and disgrace of an experience. Forgot to mention when I asked them if they will refund my ticket they answered with a “no” just like everything else. This is an airline that has no care or regard to the costumer. I felt like I was in the twilight zone since I was told no and then yes we will bring it followed with no. Filled in with a bunch of I don’t knows. I will call and speak to a manager. I will come back with an update with how they handle the aftermath of my disaster of an experience.

### "our flight was cancelled 2
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Leon. I am writing this review to save others from the headache and trouble this flight has caused our family vacation. I wish I would have check reviews on Interjet. I booked a reservation for 5 passengers in August for October 2018. Two weeks before our flight I receive a call and email requesting me to call their customer line due to changes that have been done to our flight. I call their customer service department per their request and the customer service wait is over 30 minutes hold, so beware and be ready to hold! Once I got a customer service representative, their services were not helpful or friendly and lack motivation to find a reasonable solution. I call to find out that our flight was cancelled for our departure. We were forced to move our dates and make new arrangements for our family vacation. Well, 1 week before our flight I get the same call and email and I thought "this must be a joke". I call to only find out that once again the new flight we selected was canceled again! The rep. offers to split our family in different flights, which was certainly not an option and then again demonstrates zero motivation to resolve or to achieve customer satisfaction!

### "They were in total error"
Mexico City to Tijuana. Was flying with my dog, listed on their website as a dangerous dog which required special conditions. After meeting all of their requirements & confirming he was eligible to fly per a phone call to them, was turned away. They said he was a "restricted dog". They were in total error but would not even listen!! Their customer complaint department was a total joke. I sent them a link to their pet requirements link which they just ignored. They responded with a link to a site stating they can refuse, at any time & for any reason flight for any dog. Nowhere was this link attached to their pet policy page, But the airport personnel were in error because they said he was a restricted dog, which was not listed as such, on their pet policy page. Of course, no refund, even though it was their error.

### "blatantly ignore a customer"
Mexico City to Guadalajara. We arrived hour before flight as the ticket suggested 50 minutes before. We had boarding pass and went to check bags and they took bags. Said he needed to get tag for carrying on, he left when he returned he said we missed our flight and needed to buy a new ticket. After he wasted time returning we were 50 minutes from flight (their required time on boarding pass). We asked for supervisor, supervisor said nothing he could do, did not confirm what happened just said no we needed a new ticket. This was all preceded by Interjet changing our original flight. We purchased ticket to leave 12:05pm they called days later to change departure to 11:40am. We accepted and arrived by 10:40. We’re at counter by 10:45. This airline had no customer service. Won’t listen or attempt to help. They state policies without verifying what happened or what their employees have done. This is the 3rd time internet either canceled or changed flight without any help or apology. We travel a lot people and employees make mistakes but to blatantly ignore a customer or not be willing to find a solution except pay more is inexcusable. Even discounted airlines must provide what they are selling.

### "the worst airline"
Houston to Monterrey. This is by far the worst airline doing business in the USA. their customer service always takes you to Spanish speakers even if you don’t choose Spanish. They delay flights and give you restaurant vouchers $25, to a restaurant that costs $28 a plate. They refuse to reimburse you the money and make guarantees that other employees deny. The customer service cannot transfer you to another department and tells you to call the same number and try each option. Interjet outsource to the Philippines to get English speaking staff since you guys are the cheapest airline trying to do business in the USA.

### Interjet customer review
Mexico City to Puerto Vallarta. I purchased ticket from interjet for a Columbian friend out of Bogata.The flight had a stop in Mexico City. Once in Mexico City he had to check in but his flight was nearly two hours late arriving. It was to leave at 945 am and he reached the check in at 845am ( one hour before) . At the check in counter in Mexico City they told him he needed to pay for an assigned seat. He did not request an assigned seat. He had no money but for food. By the time, he explained his situation, interjet rep. told him it was too late and he had to pay for a new flight at 1pm. ($400) It was then he called me to help. I bought him another ticket that night on a discount airlines. ($120) I’ve complained to the airlines but to no avail. I can’t figure why they just didn’t place him on the next flight to Puerto Vallarta. There were open seats on both flights according to the representative I spoke too initially. It makes no sense.

### "Worst customer service"
Mexico City to Bogota. Worst customer service ever! Misleading information from Interjet staff made me miss my flight! On July 24th I had a 6:45pm flight from Mexico City to Bogotá, Colombia. I showed up 2 hours before my flight as it was recommended on the email I got from Interjet. I don’t speak Spanish enough yet so I showed my flight information on my phone to a lady welcoming the passengers at the Interjet gate on the first floor of the airport. She said to go to the third line which is « checkin without boarding pass ». The line was terribly long. I waited about one hour and I was stressing out because I saw the sign saying that flights close 45 minutes before take off time. When I finally got to the counter, I showed my flight information and passport to the lady. She immediately said that it was the Domestic flight counter and that I needed to go upstairs to Puerta 9 for international checkin. I told her I had very little time left and that the other lady made me wait in this wrong line but there was nothing she wanted to do for me. I ran upstairs with all my luggage and it took me a good 15 minutes to get to the international interjet counter. When I showed my info and my passport to the staff, it was 6:05pm. They told me with no compassion that the flight was closed and I needed to buy an an extra ticket because I got there too late. Even though I explained my situation of misleading information from the first staff member who told me to go to the domestic flight queue... the supervisor old man said there was nothing he could do. At that point I was crying and hyperventilating because I paid a lot of money for that flight to Colombia. He was  rude and told me to leave and buy another ticket. I sat in a corner crying and panicking because the one-way flights I looked up for the same night were 1000$ Cad. I had already paid 500$ Cad for this return flight. Someone else said that we needed proof from the person who misguided me. In the mean time, I lost my flight and needed to buy another one. I decided to go talk to the supervisor myself. The first woman supervisor tried to make calls and told me I needed to be there 3 hours before my flight. I showed her evidence from my email that I was given the information of 2 hours prior to flight departure. She argued that it was the wrong web page because it’s really 3 hours. Since it’s not my responsibility to double check every info I get by email I kept asking for a replacement flight. She told me again that I needed to prove that I was given the wrong info by showing which lady pointed me the wrong queue at the beginning. I said that they should check their cameras and that she should find which staff member was working at that time (she wasn’t there anymore). She said it wasn’t possible and i should talk to customer service. Another woman brought me to a different counter. I waited about 20 minutes before someone told me what was going on. The supervisor made more verifications and confirmed that my flight was lost. I had to pay the difference between the cost of my original flight and the new one.

### "Don't waste your time or money"
Houston to Mexico city. So I decided to send my kids for the summer with there grandmother to Mexico city. They left July 6 Friday and landing in Mexico city 2 hours later. I registered three luggage on the way there but only received 2 when landed. I tried to speak to customer service first they told me to luggage stayed back in Houston and then when I called again they told me I had to wait 8 days before they can file claim when I called again they told me I had to wait 10 days for them to file claim after that they just told me I had to wait until whenever I got an email which I never did. And now they're telling me all they want to give me a $77 for the luggage they lost. I would never ever buy another ticket with them again. Every time I called it was something different they never got the correct color of the luggage correct every time I called it was either green white blue they never had the correct information that I gave them. We know that you cannot buy much in the USA with $77 for kids. Don't waste your time or money with this Interjet Airline

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  My review is based on the horrible customer service provided by personnel on my flight from LAX to SJC and my interaction with their complaint department after the flight. Let me first start off by stating that I am fully aware that there are certain situations, such as weather conditions and airport closures, that are completely out of the control of any airline personnel. However, I strongly believe that the consequence of providing information during a route diversion, crisis, etc is the responsibility of all flight personnel, and this was not my experience with Interjet on 6/14/18. Our flight was diverted to Mazatlan due to hurricane Bud, and we were informed with the barely audible PA system that we would instead be flying into La Paz, Mexico and not San Jose del Cabo. When I asked the flight attendants for clarification with follow-up questions as to land transportation, etc., the attendant mentioned, "Interjet would be providing land transportation to Los Cabos;" this was not the case. A fact that I received when asking further questions for clarification from another Interjet personnel who boarded the plane in Mazatlan. While in Mazatlan for more than 2.5hours, we were unable to disembark from the plane, when asked for water I was told from the flight attendant, "its for our next flight. Once in La Paz, there was no customer representative I could speak to in person nor through the phone. We arrived to La Paz in the evening as it began to rain, and due to the unconfirmed road conditions, I made the decision to rent a hotel room and take a taxi the next morning for the approximate 2.5 hr drive to Cabo San Lucas. Once I arrived home, I wrote a formal complaint to no avail, not even an apology or effort to try to improve their customer service. I of course, will never be flying with Interjet again, the extra leg space was definitely not worth the additional costs and stress that was incurred.

### "offered a change of dates"
Los Angeles to Guadalajara. I booked a flight to Mexico 6 days ago for myself, my 3 year old son, my fiancé and his sister. I went to the doctor today and found out I was 5 weeks pregnant. After speaking with my doctor about my upcoming travel plans he informed me about the dangers of the Zika virus to my unborn child, and how anyone I come in close contact with who’s been infected could pass it to me and in turn my baby for up to 6 months after being infected. He was very adamant that my son, my fiancé, and I not go on our trip and provided me with a Formal letter stating that for medical reasons I cannot travel to Mexico or South America. I’ve now spent almost 10 hours going back and forth with “customer service” who has offered me a change of travel dates. I’m shocked this isn’t considered and extraordinary circumstance for which the website states a refund will be honored. I’ve sent in documentation by my physician just to have someone respond with a generic message denying my request.

### "had a pleasant experience"
I flew on Interjet from Puerto Vallarta to Toluca and had a pleasant experience. I was a bit hesitant to take a Sukhoi regional jet, but it was in good shape and the flight was smooth. The only thing I didn't like is how incredibly short the entry to the plane is, and despite ducking, I hit my head on the way in and on the way out. (I am 6'1" so not incredibly tall.) The seats and overhead bins were sized like a regular jet. Customer service was good, there was free drink service, on board announcements were made in English and Spanish, and I had no trouble with anything associated with my reservation. I would happily fly with Interjet again the next time I visit Mexico, especially considering its good value.

### "sympathetic and understanding"
After unsatisfactory service with an agent (in Spanish) I called back and spoke to a rep in English. I hope the language did not play a part in the quality of service, but the young lady who assisted me was wonderful. She was not only polite and patient, she also took the time to answer questions regarding my family member's tourist visa. She was sympathetic and understanding to my hesitation in reserving without knowing and exact return date and was quite knowledgeable in offering options under those circumstances.

### "I felt used by an airline"
I booked this flight thinking I was going to Leon, Nicaragua, yes my mistake for booking the wrong flight and I admit that but what followed was just not good enough. On check in I asked for, “flight to Nicaragua” and was told to wait in line. I stopped the same guy and said I had to, “clear customs as it’s an international flight” he then let me to the front of the line (as it was big). At the desk I very clearly said, “flight to Leon, Nicaragua” to which the guy chats to me about rugby and checks me in. Not once did someone point out that wasn’t where I was going. Not one itinerary from them said “Leon, Mexico”. Nothing indicated that I wasn’t on the right flight. I landed in Leon, Mexico and tearfully explained what had happened to staff who were rude, told me it was all my fault (I did take partial blame) and were very unhelpful leaving me feeling stranded and let down. To make it worse they made rude comments about me in Spanish as I was talking in English and were too ignorant to think I would know Spanish. They were extremely rude and disrespectful. They disregard you as a person and see you as a money making opportunity. I’ve never felt the need to write a review about an airline but this was the first time I felt used by an airline.

### "not worth the headache"
Cancun to Los Angeles. Save your money, not worth the headache. I should have listened to the other bad reviews. Rude stewardesses, didn’t smile once, old plane, seats were ripped and arm rests did not work. Took over an hour for our luggage to come down. The trip back home was even worse, no apologies or explanations at all or ever. Also long wait lines to check in, web site never worked. After standing in line for 45 minutes to check in they send me to go pay for baggage in a different line so I had to come back and wait some more. Never again.

### "great service and wonderful flight"
Cancun to Toronto. My Wife and I had never flown with Interjet before and after flying with them I wanted to give them a great review. Staff were great, the flight was amazing they served us a nice sandwich and refreshments and if you wanted an alcohol drink there was no charge for that. Thank you Interjet for the great service and wonderful flight.

### "cabin crew kind and attentive"
I made short 30 minutes flights Acapulco - Mexico City - Acapulco last week. First flight on Sukhoi Superjet plane, which made a very good impression on me. Comfortable and modern, although quite loud. But for a short flight it wasn't a problem to me. Check-in and boarding were very efficient and cabin crew kind and attentive. Despite being a low-cost airline, Interjet allows you checked baggage up to 25kg, which is very generous comparing to other airlines. Overall, an excellent experience and clear recommendation!

### "most stressful flight experience"
Cancun to Vancouver. Had the most stressful flight experience ever with this airline and strongly advice everyone to never book a flight with them to avoid trouble! My partner and I (and many other travellers with work permits for Canada) were denied boarding (Cancun - Vancouver flight) because of staff of Interjet airline. They wouldn't let us board saying that Work Visa is not enough to enter Canada and that we need a separate eTA application. Which is incorrect since all work permits issued after August 1, 2015 already have an eTA. After they wasted two hours of our time arguing, I was able to find immigration paperwork to show them that my eTA is linked to my passport, so they let me board the plane but they didn't let my partner so he stayed stranded in Cancun due to their incompetence. Before he was able to get the info they wanted, it was too late, they had closed the flight and made him change his ticket. Their policy conveniently doesn't allow for any refunds either. Due to all the chaos the flight got delayed for two hours and the captain informed us on the plane that we would do an emergency stop over to get fuel in Monterrey! As a cherry on top, they don't serve any food on plane either. 6h flight turned into 10h of a horrific flight experience. If you travel to/ within Mexico do yourself a favour and never book a flight with Interjet!

### "customer service is terrible"
Cancun to Bogota. The customer service is terrible, on the return flight to Bogota I had the misfortune of being assisted by an employee of Interjet that shouted at me because my suitcase weighed 0.5kg more than what is supposed to weigh (25.5kg). However, my ticket shows 50kg without specifying the number of bags, at the time I showed the ticket basically told me off for not knowing the fine print of the airlines. I got out of line and made me wait a long time to register my luggage. During the flight I ordered a coffee 3 times, the flight attendant told me 3 times and I bring your coffee but it never arrived. | El servicio al cliente es pésimo, en el vuelo de Regreso a Bogotá tuve la desgracia de ser atentido por una empleada de Interjet esta señora me grito porque mi maleta pesaba 0,5kg más de lo que supuestamente deberá pesar. 25,5kg. Sin embargo en mi tiquete aparece 50Kg sin especificar la cantidad de maletas, en el momento que le mostre el tiquete basicamente me dijo bruto por no saber la letra pequeña de las aerolineas, me saco de la fila y me hizo esperar un buen tiempo para registrar mi equipaje. Durante el vuelo pedi un cafe 3 veces, la asistente de vuelo me dijo las 3 veces ya traigo su cafe pero este nunca llego.

### "Horrible and dishonest airline"
Cancun to Puerto Vallarta. Horrible and dishonest airline. My first flight was delayed 1.5 hours because the pilot was late so I missed my connecting flight. They tried to put us on flight to another town and said to take the bus for 60 minutes to our final destination. They refused to see when the bus left or if it still had room. When I looked up the drive time google said 5.5 hours! We refused to be treated like cattle. We had no luggage because they sent that to the final destination but they refused to pay for fresh cloths or underwear. The airline said the delay was not its fault (Blamed it on airport flight control even though it was the morning and barely anyone was at the airport. Horrible excuse for a 90 minute delay!) so it didn't have to refund my ticket, provide compensation for my lost hotel stay that evening in my final destination or pay for my choice of food/drinks. It did put us up in a terrible hotel and the hotel would not let us order off the hotel menus because the airline only pays $9 per meal. The lunch and dinner menu is the same! Also, the airline will only pay for water or soda pop.

### "I asked why the fee?"
Las Vegas to Mexico City. Return flight charged $25 fee for 1 luggage! I asked why the fee? Hardly speaking English but was condescending, she said we have economy ticket. That was free with LAS flight. She said “tarifa” and fee for seat change! Each of us paid $135.58 taxes and fees. The couple who joined us on this trip, tickets same as ours didn’t get charged for anything and got their seats changed!

### "they have the worst customer service"
Booked to fly Interjet from Reynosa to Guerrero via Mexico City. Do not use this airline, it is unreliable and they have the worst customer service. Booking with them will end up costing you triple. We purchased two tickets to Mexico City 4 months ahead of time. Two weeks before our flight was scheduled, we get an email saying that the route had been canceled. We were not informed of this until right before our flight, although the agent said the route was canceled just after we purchased our tickets. The only solution they offered was paying for a bus ticket to take us to the next nearest airport (3.5hrs away, on what is the most dangerous highway in all of Mexico, between the cities of Monterey and Reynosa). After hours talking to the most incompetent and apathetic customer service agents I've ever experienced, we ended up just getting a refund and having to re-book the trip on a different airline. Due to how last minute this new booking was, we ended up paying triple what the original trip would have cost if we had gone with any other airline.

### "Both my flights were delayed"
Mexico City to Cancun. It was my first time to try this airline. I normally took Volaris or Viva because they're cheaper. But I was headed to Cancún and I wanted this first trip to be perfect so I chose a "better" airline based on its reviews and pricing. Both my flights were delayed and Interjet staff didn't even apologize nor explain to the passengers the reason for the delayed flights. And it wasn't just our flight that was delayed for 2 hours, even most Interjet flights to other destinations were also delayed that day. I have seen a lot of "demorados" (delayed) Interjet flights in the screen, unlike Aeromexico and other flights that were "a tiempo" (on time). I wished I have chosen Volaris or Viva instead.

### "has the worst customer service"
Cancun to Torreon via Mexico city. Interjet has the worst customer service ever. As I arrived to the airport the flight had already 1.5 hours of delay. There was no information in the screens and no personnel to explain what was happening. We end up having a delay of 7 hours! Obviously I lost my connection flight and I was not offered any alternative because as they told me, the flight next morning was oversold. When I called to ask for a refund they told me it was not possible because it was a no show! But it was a no show because of their fault.

### "good for a 1 hour flight"
Guadalajara to Mexico City. Is not the best experience but its good for a 1 hour flight, the space between seats is huge compared with other airlines in Mexico, the comfort of the seats is ok for a short flight. The food is chips and a drink in all Interjet's flights, the crew is polite and thats all, not bad but not incredible, we took off and landed on time, something rare if you travel to Mexico City and something they have to improve is the inflight entertainment, the sound is terrible and very tiny screens for all the plane. Interjet is a good option for domestic flight.

### "definitely fly with them again"
My husband and I flew with Interjet from Toronto to Cancun this weekend for a quick getaway (Flights 2841 and 2840). After reading many horrible reviews we were quite concerned that we were going to have a travel nightmare. However, our experience was 100% positive. The airline is quite new flying from Pearson. The planes were in good condition, clean and had phenomenal legroom. Check-in and boarding was quick and efficient. Flight crew were friendly. We departed and arrived on time both ways. They served complimentary drinks (including beer) and sandwiches on the flights. The only slightly annoying thing was on the way to Mexico the TV screens were on and the sound is played throughout the plane quite loud so you don't really have an option to not watch it. The price was excellent and comfort was better than Air Canada rouge and some of the other charter airlines I have taken down South in the past. I'd definitely fly with them again.

### "don't fly with them"
Miami to Cancun. Esta es la peor aereolinia con la que puedas viajar. mantente lejos de ellos. Yo hice una recerva de miami a cancun ida y vuelta en agosto del ano pasado para viajer en mayo 27. Para sorpresa el dia 20 me mandan un email que mi vuelo fue cambiado saliendo de miami en la tarde en vez de la manana ahora con una parada en mexico City de 3 horas y llegaria a cancun a las 7 de la noche(dia perdido). Para rematar su mal trabajo ya mi vuelo de regreso no era el dia 3 de junio me lo cambiaron para el dia 4 con la misma parada en mexico city y con unas cuantas horas mas esperando en el aereopuerto. Yo la verdad que no se que se pensaron ellos pero en estados unidos para salir de vacaciones no es de un dia para otro uno se planifica pero a ellos no les importa al parecer. Gracias a su mal trabajo termini pagan 640 dollares con american para volar directo. Si hubiese echo mi vuelo desde el incio con american estoy seguo que no hubiese tenido que pagar tanto ya que mi reserva la hice con varios meses de antelacion. ENGLISH This is the worst company you can travel with. If you want to get a headache keep away from them. I have a trip planned since August last year with non stop flight from Miami to Cancun for May 27 - to my surprise on May 20 I receive an email saying my flight was change it and now I will have a stop flight in Mexico City making me from airport to airport from 1:30 pm getting to cancun at 7 pm with the hour of difference from Miami to Cancun - regular flight from Miami to Cancun is 2 hours and have to spend almost 8 hours in airport wasn't funny. The other part was to flight back my original flight to back in Miami was set to be on Saturday instead they change it to Sunday and with stop again in the Mexico city airport. Thanks to them I had to get another flight and pay 240 dollars difference because the last minute book. So if you want to save money and a headache don't fly with them.

### "I do not recommend them"
Chicago to San Jose via Mexico City. My original flight times were I would leave Chicago at 1 pm with a 9 hour lay over in Mexico City and I would arrive in Costa Rica by 9:55. Well they have not only enlongated my layover from 9 hours to 15 hour they also delayed my flight another hour on top of that. When we asked if they could bump us to an earlier flight, which has open availability according to their website they said it would cost an extra $800. They still do not even know which gate we will be departing from and are required have to listen to their announcement. Which I might inform you are all in Spanish, which I do not speak. I have spent the first day of my vacation, which I paid for, in a international airport because of all of the inconviences they have put us through. I do not recommend them to anyone flying with a set schedule.

### "don't use this airline"
Chicago to Lima via Mexico City. The day of the flight they decided to change my return date flight two days after my scheduled one. I called and spoke to several representatives for about 3 hours to see why and they never gave me a straight answer. I asked to be compensated for hotel and food for the extra 2 days l would have to stay in Lima because of their fault. Again they transferred me to a different department and the person transferred me to the main (800) number. After an hour I finally reached a person who was trying to help. He said they can't do anything now but will file a complaint and I will hear a response in 10-15 days. It's been past that and I have not even heard sorry from them. Finally, I ended up rescheduling my return date flight a day early than my original date so I don't have to pay for two extra days worth of cost because afraid of them not reimbursing anything back. I however did lose a day of paid hotel and activities I had planned. Thanks Interjet but I will never use you again. Please people don't use this airline! Don't fall for their cheap prices as I did, I wouldn't want this to happen to anyone.

### "does not care about customers "
Miami to Cancun. This was the single worst experience we have ever had with any airline. They cancelled our flight from MIA to Cancun. First they said there was mechanical issues but later changed their story to bad weather so they would not be responsible. Funny how no other airlines flying the same or similar routes were delayed, much less cancelled. We called and spoke with customer service and after 4 times on the phone with them we were able to get them to agree to a full refund, considering we were forced to book new same day flights with a different airline. Well, here we are 5 months later and they have still failed to provide that refund. Terrible customer service. This airline does not care about their customers or doing the right thing. Avoid at all costs.

### "service value for money"
Guatemala to Mexico City. Ground staff are helpful. Very quick check in. Flight departure right on time. In flight service value for money. Cabin crew are helpful and polite. In flight no have personal tv. Flight arrive before 10 mins of schedule time. Very good service if you think about money.

### "90 minutes in line to drop bags"
Cancun to Mexico City. Waited 90 minutes in line to drop bags. Was quite a wait and not fun for my 4 small kids. Priority check in had no line. Aircraft is new and there is plenty of space (I am 198cm). Flight delayed so far by 15min. Would only fly again if with priority checkin.

### "Worst airline experience ever"
❎ Unverified |  Havana to Houston via Mexico city. Horrific service. Arrive at Havana airport to be informed that airline changed our flight from Havana, which meant we lost our connection in Mexico city. We were not informed in advance and ended up stuck at Havana airport for 8 hours. There is literally nothing at the Havana airport, not even hot food. No one at the Havana airport could make arrangements for a hotel in mexico city as we were stranded overnight. When we landed at Mexico city we were forced to walk miles with our luggage to be dealt with so rudely by staff. Essentially we were ignored by counter staff until I was crying and begging for assistance from security. We waited nearly 2 hours for a hotel to be arranged that took an hour to get to from the airport, when there are hotels in and around the airport. Worst airline experience ever.

### "Nice experience, overall"
Cancun to Mexico City. Flight delayed, also we had to wait at the parking place in Mexico city for about 30 minutes for busses to come, although it was a code share flight and many passengeers had a connection flight with Iberia. Remarkable there was lot of space among seat rows, more than in national carrier airplanes. Crew was friendly and helpful. Nice experience, overall.

### "friendly crew, onboard service ok"
Generally a perfect flight with Interjet from Cancun to Havana. Check-in in Cancun was very friendly and fast. Flight was on time, friendly crew, onboard service ok. (Beverages non-/alcoholic and crackers). As used to mostly European airlines I had to point out that seat space is more than exceptional. Interjet seated their A320 with only 150 seats. Each row is 34" apart. Was now my fourth flight with this airline. All of them went similar to this one. Can only recommend Interjet.

### "it was like being on a cheap bus"
Flew Interjet from New York JFK to Mexico City. TVs were on and blaring for a majority of both our departing and returning flight, including at about 3 am in the middle of a red eye when they turned on the cabin lights so everyone could have drinks. This was incredibly obnoxious. It's 2017. If you want to watch TV you've probably got your own way to do it, or at the very least don't blast the sound throughout the cabin but offer a headphone jack. It was like being on a cheap bus when all you want to do is sleep but can't because of obnoxiously loud entertainment. If you can put up with that for the discount, then the airline was extremely cheap and did seem pretty reliable. But in my mind, it wasn't worth it, and I wish I'd known that this was the case before so we could've had a more pleasant travel experience even at a higher cost.

### "worst experience with any airline"
Houston to Lima via Mexico City. This is the worst experience I have had with any airline. I travel internationally very often, and am always looking for a good deal, so despite the terrible reviews about Interjet, I figured it was worth the risk. We originally were to leave at 6 am from Houston and get to Lima at 5 pm. Then they changed the flight from Houston to Mexico to 7am, only giving 1 hr layover, which they told us is not long enough to make the connecting flight. That was the only flight of the day so we were forced to take a flight the day before from Houston to Mex at 5pm and have a 12 hour layover in Mexico (and after being on the phone with them for 4 hours, they refused to give us hotel accommodations). They changed the flight from 5pm to 7am, meaning our flight time was now 33h 45 minutes in total. Still offered no accommodation. I called to verify the new 7am flight and they said that we still owed a balance. I had paid for the flights in full at the time of booking, but they stated they had raised the price and we owed $300 more. I thought that was illegal? They denied that they raised the prices and instead said I only partially paid at the time of booking. Even though I have the confirmation in front of me that states paid in full. I have never left a negative review of anything before, but I cannot stress enough not to fly with them. We booked them through Justfly.com and they are also extremely difficult to deal with over the phone.

### "don't waste your time or money"
❎ Unverified |  Dallas to Guatemala via Mexico City. Interjet cancelled our flight less than 24 hours before departing and didn't have replacement flights until mid February. We called several times to get a reimbursement for our tickets and every time we called, they asked the same banking information all over again. Customer service was rude and not helpful at all. We have been waiting for almost 2 months and they are atill saying the disbursement didn't go through after asking banking info again. Don't waste your time or money with them.

### "1h40 min flight took us 22h"
Never fly Interjet. I am a frequent traveller and this is the worst experience I had flying. Initially they changed the time of my flight with a 2 hours delay from Cancun to Miami, then the flight was cancelled and we had to fly through Mexico City. The flight to Mexico city was also delayed, then we had to wait for another flight to Miami which again, has been delayed. Instead of a direct 1h40 min flight to Miami it took us 22h. This airline is so disorganised, unprofessional and ruined all our nice memories from this vacation. Trust me whatever is your motivation do not take Interjet.

### "punctuality gets worse"
Tijuana to Mexico City. I am a usual Interjet customer and starting 2017, I will quit flying with them. It seems like they have been over estimating their poor ability to organize themselves on time. I have been flying on Interjet for last 3 years almost monthly base, and their punctuality gets worse to the point of being not acceptable.

### "Outrageous and unacceptable"
Tijuana to Mexico City. Flight 2403, Scheduled to depart at 5:30 PM on December 23, but it was delayed 3 hrs, and we waited until 8:40 for the plane to depart. After arrival to Mexico City again we waited 2 hours for luggage. While waiting there, we found out another flight from Interjet had already waited almost 5 hours for there luggage, Outrageous and unacceptable!

### "painful disorganized system2
Houston to México. Initially because of airport delays (or so they told us) Interjet canceled our 8pm flight. They had no notice on the screen from where will the flight depart and poor passenger info. The gate was a mess even though there were at least 4 Interjet people, no English info either. On our way to the plane they stoped us and informed some of us the flight was canceled, no microphone info, or English version again, highlighting their poor organization. Last minute we had to find a hotel and cancel early work meetings. They booked us next day at 8pm again! We refused and finally they found seats at 9:40am but we almost didn't make it. Next morning The company created an atmosphere of stress calling for people's names (among which were ours) to check in ASAP (almost 2h before flight) we were in an initial cue and to get quicker attention we moved to the line they instructed. People were aggressive and rude because of the stress and confusing instructions. Finally at the desk, the Interjet staff was rude. Finally at the gate they called in for checking documents of around 30 people, work that could have been done at check in, this of course delayed the flight once more. Interjet doesn't use their resources intelligently and make their passengers suffer a painful disorganized system. If you can avoid it don't use this company.

### "seats were so spacious"
On an Iberia flight to Cancun from Madrid with stopover in Mexico City, we got to fly the last leg with Interjet which has codeshare partnerships with many oneworld airlines. The seats were so spacious and they all looked like they were for business class (armchairs with kind of leader). The crew were very friendly and apologised for the small delays we had. Everything looked very professional and they were very attentive with the passengers. A small snack and some non-alcoholic drinks were served. The airline is new and seems like it wants to make a good impression and if it keeps the standard like this they can become a oneworld member soon.

### "courteous, attentive and professional"
New York JFK to Cancun. The flight was smooth no issues, website is a little antiquated as far as being able to have E-Boarding passes, picking own seats. Otherwise staff both on and off the plane were both courteous, attentive and professional. Snack options on the flight was very good a sandwich chips and drink of choice and you get the entire bottle. Evening though the website shows the flight is book there were plenty of seats available to move about and stretch out if desired.

### "good service, timely departure"
Mexico City to Tuxtla and first time flying Interjet - I was very impressed. Not complex in booking (unlike some other Mexican discount airlines) because the features you need are included in your fare. Good service, timely departure and arrival. Comfortable plane. I'm a guy, but was still impressed that Interjet keeps one washroom reserved for women only. I would fly them again - and have, several times. Of three subsequent flights with Interjet, two had delays (approx 2 hours) - but delays on planes leaving MEX are common and Interjet announcements and information on status of the flights met expectations.

### "worst experience ever"
Monterrey to Mexico City with Interjet, and the worst experience ever. The flight was delayed by couple hours. Original departure time was 20:40 - I did not arrive at Mexico City until 01:45 AM. The entire flight was on hold waiting a gate for over 20 minutes. Once the gate was set we were dropped-off in the ground level to wait for bus to transport us to the main terminal. It was raining and I felt in dangerous walking down the escalator, the stairs were wet and slippery. Once the bus finally arrived we went inside to find out the bus had the AC blasting cold. I immediately got sick. Like the plane had the heater blasting and we step out to a freezing-cold bus in the middle of the rain. I don't think I will fly interjet again.

### "worst customer service"
Cancun to Zihuatanejo via Mexico City with Interjet. The flight from CUN-MEX was delayed by over an hour, with my layover being 1.5 hours. There were 3 people on my flight who were supposed to be on that connecting flight to ZIH, and although we only landed in Mexico City 15 minutes after the ZIH flight took off, Interjet did not feel the need to hold the plane. Understandable if they had another MEX-ZIH flight going out that day, but they did not. When I got off the plane I was told by an Interjet representative that if I booked through a different airline I would get a refund for the new ticket. The representative said he would meet us after we get our bags. I ended up waiting over an hour for Interjet to find my bag and the representative that said they would meet us by baggage claim never showed up. After 2 hours without any real answers about the refund, I was able to buy a ticket through Aeromexico. As I had booked a flight from ZIH-MEX through Interjet, I had to deal with them again. When I checked in for the ZIH-MEX flight I asked the Interjet employee for a phone number I could call to pursue my refund. He gave me a number for a line that asked me to take a survey so that I could win a vacation. Worst customer service and I will never fly Interjet again.

### "chalk and cheese experience"
Mexico City to San Jose and Interjet was a chalk and cheese experience. On the outbound leg we made an unscheduled diversion to collect passengers from a flight that made an emergency landing the previous night. On landing, chaose ensued as they appeared to have no idea of how many passengers should be on board and immigration officials got involved as there appeared to be some problem with departure cards. The net result was that a 3 hour journey turned into one of 8 hours! On the way back, everything worked perfectly.

### "third time that they're late"
The third time that I need to use this Interjet and then third time that they're late. When we were in the plane, it was moved to the taxiway but the 2nd engine didn't start. The aircraft was pulled to the gate and requested passengers to wait in the hall. We waited 3 hours 40 minutes until a technician from performed the repairments needed. The airline doesn´t gave us food (mandatory after 3 hours).

### "best airline in Mexico in my opinion"
Interjet is the best airline in Mexico in my opinion. I travelled between Mexico and Colombia return and found them to be organised ,friendly and professional and the 50kg luggage allowance is generous. The aircraft were clean and flights were on time. I'm not sure if it's classified as a low cost carrier but it was cheap and better than some full service carriers that I've used.

### "nothing to complain about"
Excellent. Good plane, nice Interjet cabin crew, clear information from the pilot, good drinks. Nothing to complain about with flying Interjet.

### Interjet customer review
Flew MEX-MID return just a week ago. Flight there went smoothly great jetBlue-like service with free snacks and drinks and friendly cabin crew. No seatback entertainment system (only dropdown screens) and the in-seat audio system didn't work at all but I didn't really mind since it was only a 1 hour flight. On flight back due to change of plans I ended up arriving at MEX much earlier than planned and to shorten the wait for the flight I asked for an earlier flight got one that departed 1 hour earlier at no additional charge (which may not be a plus as seen later in the story). Boarded the flight everything went just as well as before until approach to MID. Pilot comes on the radio and says that there will be a 10-15 minute delay because of weather. So the plane circles around a bit (in heavy turbulence I might add) and 20 minutes later the pilot comes over the radio and says that we're diverting to CUN. We diverted to CUN waited an hour on the ground and went back to MID. At MID I checked the board and the flight I was originally booked on had arrived on time. Thankfully I wasn't connecting or doing anything important but still. However I can't blame the airline for the weather and it's a good airline.

### Interjet customer review
It's five to six hours to Mexico City by bus about an hour by air. With the senior citizen discount plus 10% credit on each flight Interjet's flights are economical time savers. Another attraction is the 50 kilo (110 lbs.) free baggage limit. The service is okay but there are some problems with flights being on time. I always figure on certain flights from Mexico City arriving at least 20 minutes late despite the flight information board displaying them as "on time. I fly Interjet nationally and internationally and find the general service pretty good. It seems a flexible policy to wait for late passengers a practice which can easily cause a cabin full of punctual passengers to be delayed 15 minutes.

### Interjet customer review
CUN-MEX on A320 small details on maintenance made me feel unsafe. Some bottom parts of the seats were not tight. Result was seats tilted forward during the flight 3 screens of ceiling entertainment system did not return to the resting position. Flight was on time and service was nice but basic. They offer potato chips and beverage/drinks. I cannot understand why they advertise that they have a WC only for women.

### Interjet customer review
SJD-GDL A320 all Y service. Long line to check-in albeit personnel cheerfully provided boarding pass. No jetbridge at SJD so boarded the plane from the rear. Modern clean aircraft with nice all-female flight attendants. Two drink services were impressive for a 50 min flight. Very good service. Would not hesitate flying them again.

### Interjet customer review
GDL-TIJ return. Check-in for my departing flight at the GDL airport was smooth. Once on board I found the seats to be very narrow and it was difficult to avoid hitting the man in the next seat with my elbows when reading. I am not particularly large 5'2" and 125 lbs so my size was not the problem. The flight attendants were very late serving the beverages and small snack. Overall the flight was not bad and was full. On my return check-in was lengthy because there was only one person at the counter. Finally they got someone else at the counter who was more efficient and the line moved more quickly. On this flight the FA's served the beverages and snack earlier in the flight. The flight was smooth and we arrived in GDL on time.

### Interjet customer review
Guadalajara - Toluca - Acapulco and Acapulco - Mexico City - Merida in the last week and very impressed. All flights on time or early great service from check in staff and onboard free drinks including cocktails and beer snacks and new aircraft with excellent legroom. Highly recommended for the low fares and excellent service. The website is now quite easy and seats can be reserved at the time of reservation.

### Interjet customer review
Mexico City - Huatulco. Chose Interjet as Mexicana bankrupcy left only Interjet Aeromar and Magni charters operating this route. A little worried by the website - which does not do the airline justice. Very impressed by Interjet - choice of seat at time of reservation. At Mexico City Airport queue for check in long but well organised boarding by zones (no scrum like Ryanair). Fairly new planes clean and tidy. Helpful crew with complimentary drinks (inc alcohol) snacks and headsets.

### Interjet customer review
Return MEX-LMM as part of a holiday and fantastic for a low cost carrier - it's pretty good even when comparing to some of the others in Mexico. The reduced seat capacity for extra leg room is welcomed for someone my size (6.2) and service is efficient and crisp. Nice new planes are also cleaner than some of Aeromexico and Mexicana's aging fleet. Fantastic experience and I must say very unexpected given their awful website. Don't be scared by the site - the experience is worth it!

### Interjet customer review
MTY-CUN return on A320. Interjet offer a generous legroom. The service during the flights consists of crisps and tacos (not much for a 2 hrs 30 mins flight) along with a bar service including beers and tequila. The planes are equipped with drop-down-screens and individual audio systems as well as flight deck cameras.

### Interjet customer review
Mexico City (Toluca) - Cancun flight: Overall a good experience and the most attractive fares offered but although the aircraft was new and the IFE was decent the terminal at TLC is truly disapointing not even a baggage claiming carousel at the airport they just drop all bags on a large room and you need to look for yours and take it out of there. There are certainly many things to improve but with Volaris AVolar Click and Viva on the market InterJet is going to set things straight and increase their quality on their services. Nice airline indeed.
