### "definitely fly Motor Sich again"
I flew Motor Sich this past July from Kyiv to Odesa and it was a great experience! It was on one of their AN 24’s and to my surprise the seats were the most comfortable economy seats I have flown, not to mention the most room. Also, when checking in my bag was a few kilos overweight and they let me check it with no extra charge! Would definitely fly Motor Sich again!

### "a great room to be improved"
Odessa to Lviv via Kiev. The ground service staff of the airline in Odessa airport of the airline still has a great room to be improved. If I could give a zero for the ground service rating, I would have given it one. Just a moment ago, I checked in my bag at the check in my bag. I was told that the bag will not be able to be sent directly to Lviv but instead Kiev. Within one hour of connection, I have to collect my bag and check it in again for the second flight. Okay! At this point, I was a bit nervous and asked the staff member who was helping for whether it was possible to do so, given that there wouldn’t be any minutes of delay of the flight to arrive at Kiev. She was with almost zero English and only repeated that “the bag Kiev”. I then started to use google translate tool to communicate with her and asked if she could kindly make a note that I would be doing another flight to the airline ground staff in Kiev so that they could help making things more efficient in case if the time goes too tight. She then looked for another colleague of her to help speak to me. This time, the ground staff member seemed to be able to speak more English. She of course repeated what the previous one has mentioned. But when I told her if she could help communicate with the airlines and make a note about my situation (I never asked them to help send my bag to Lviv after I was told that it’s not possible), she started to say nothing we can help and spoke to her colleagues in Ukrainian and laughed. From the gesture I could say that she should be teasing me somehow to her colleague. Hey! It was super rude!! I then stared at her sharply and showed her I knew what she was talking about from her gesture. She then urged me to go upstairs and said she could help nothing. I then asked if it’s ever the first time someone doing connecting flight, she said she didn’t know what “connecting flight” mean and said I could be the only one to do it today. Well... an airline staff member cannot understand what “connect flight” is should sound like a driver doesn’t know what gasoline means. What a great help this lady has given! I was so pissed off! This is the first and the last time I would use this airline for sure. This experience has definitely ruined my first impression to the country in the last two days. Now I’m awaiting to board the flight, waiting for that one-hour time competing moment to deal with my bag or I’d definitely miss my flight to Lviv.

### "well worth aviation experience"
Minsk to Zaporizhzhia with Motor sich airlines.The itinerary showed Antonov 140 as operating the flight, but in reality the flight was operated by Antonov 24, a 40-50 year old Soviet Aircraft. However Motor Sich airline did not pre advise of aircraft change. 2:15 h flight. Big mistake in choosing seats in the first 3 rows, they are right by the engines and the noise is deafening. |Leg room is very tight, unlike seats in rows 4 -12 have better keg room for some reason. Window shades are cotton curtains, a real weird bird, a great privilege to fly such an old bird. A nice cabin crew, provided friendly service and had perfect English. She served a ham and cheese Sandwich with some sweets, hot tea/coffee and water. Cabin was very warm too, but thats a general issue in Russia in the winter, they just like to roast in the cabins. A well worth aviation experience.
