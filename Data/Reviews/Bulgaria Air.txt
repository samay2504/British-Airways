### "Poor quality service"
I boarded the aircraft and there was no space for my standard cabin luggage of 10 kg. It was full of backpacks which usually must be placed under the seat but the cabin staff didnt bother to remove any of the backpacks and a stewardess was trying to explain to me that space for cabin luggage is not as per the standards. I had seat at row 25 and finally they found a space above seat 1 which is not acceptable since upon landing I had to walk against the other passengers in order to collect my cabin luggage or to wait all passengers to leave the aircraft. Unfortunately this is the only airline which you can use for local flights in Bulgaria. Poor quality service and unreasonably high air tickets.

### "better to pay a little bit more"
On the 5.07.24 after many many attempts I have finally got to speak to Bulgaria Air representative regarding an issue with the booking of my checking luggage. Turn it out I have not made the booking for luggage for my return flight. In order to make that extra booking, I was sent a link to make a payment via email. Payment was made I received my receipt and I went along with my journey! As I was attempting to Check in my luggage before my flight back on the 20.07.24, I was surprised to find out that the luggage was not included on my boarding pass, So I had to pay again because the airport staff did not recognise nor accept the receipt I have received for my payment! Now a day after my flight after near 50 attempts, I’m still unable to contact Bulgaria Air on their phone number! I would recommend for everybody to stay away from that company unless absolutely necessary. Sometimes it’s better to pay a little bit more but have a nice flight and have everything arranged.

### "Absolutely awful service"
Absolutely awful service. I had a flight booked originally on the 2nd of February 2022. I asked a few days before the flight if it was going to happen they said yes. It was cancelled and they offered my money back or to reschedule the flight for the 05/02/2022 to which I said yes re-schedule it. I receive an email with my ticket. On the day of the flight they said I was in the system but not on the plane - after which they told me to go and ask a help desk located in the airport. They said i cannot board the plane, and that the only way for me to fly on the day is to buy a new ticket, and the money to the newly bought ticket would be returned. I sent e-mails pictures of boarding passes and they said it would take them 2 months to process my issue. 10 months later I did not receive any answer so I emailed them. They returned the money for the first flight which was 150lev cheaper. The money I got refunded was not even the full amount! People are struggling to make ends meet and they don’t even bother to fix your issue and in the end they return not even the full amount of money. Absolutely unbelievable! I would never recommend flying with them, super unprofessional!

### "worst customer service ever"
Worst airline ever and worst customer service ever. Will never fly with them again and would recommend avoiding. Incredibly unprofessional agents. They made a mistake boarding after a delay that resulted in further delay and missing our connection (for which we had a 3 hour layover). Since it wasn’t over three hours they claim to owe us nothing. Their mistake resulted in a partially missed trip and over $800 additional travel expenses. Worst airline ever. I sincerely hope the gate agent for that flight was fired after her behavior. It was appalling.

### "staff were professional and courteous"
This was the most amusing flight I have ever flown as I got to share some laughs with not only fellow passengers, but with a hostess. Anyway, I was seated in row 9; row 10 was an exit row so I was invited to sit there since it was empty and was willing/able to assist in case of an emergency. Te leg room is excellent, and I measure 183cm. The staff were professional and courteous. Bags came out quickly. We were given water upon boarding, then a chocolate bar, then a croissant filled with chocolate sauce (worth the calories) and finally a small drink.

### "not book a flight with them"
I have travelled multiple times with them alone, with the kids and bought tickets for my dad and I had everytime struggle. One flight they told me at the check in that the strollers they do not put in bags and I was suppose to know that which I didnt so my stroller came broken in the us. Very unprofessional and the team is the same. They have wonderful flights with great connections and prices but because I had so many times struggle with them I will not book a flight with them. And I am Bulgarian!

### "cancelled without any notice"
Not Verified |  One of the worst services I've ever encountered. I was told I'm no longer on the flight less than 24 hours before departure. I emailed on the 22nd of April asking if I can receive a refund for my flight, which I did not receive. I was given alternative options such as rebooking my flight for a future date, but not once was I told that my flight would be or has been cancelled for me, only to find out myself a few hours before the flight. The woman I spoke to on the phone was very rude and unprofessional, ignoring my emails and ending the call on me several times. This flight was important for me to take as I had a connecting flight after, and I was told that the only way I could take the flight is if I upgrade and pay 400 levs. I paid for my original ticket, and for it to be cancelled for me without any notice is absurd, any other airline would at least email me or let me know? I have been on many flights and I have never encountered something like this.

### "never fly with this airline again"
So disappointed. I will never fly with this airline again. The most undereducated, complete even lack of try to understand arguments. My children 7 and 10 are flying today unattended by an adult with flight attendant. According to UK Government rules children under 11 do not need Covid test. I tried to reason with the check-in agent who wouldn't even hear what I had to say. Their tickets were detained by the airline staff and I had to pay GBP 420 so they could come home

### "We were promised a refund"
I was booked to fly but travel restrictions prevented our even getting to Bulgaria. We were promised a refund but never heard more and Air Bulgaria stopped responding to emails.

### "still didn't refund me my money"
When lockdowns started because of corona in March 2020 in South America, I was stuck in Peru. After 30 days of waiting for rescue flight back to Europe, finally I was able to go home. Rescue flight was operated by British Airways and they flew from Lima to London. Since I can't enter UK without visa, I had to buy ticket out of London asap as I land. There were no flights on the same day, but there was a flight on the next one operating by Bulgaria Air from London to Sofia. I purchased that ticket. I was about to wait 24 hours at the airport and I was fine with it. Meanwhile, Bulgaria Air canceled that flight and rescheduled for the next day. That was not fine for me as I can't spend 2 days at the airport waiting for the flight. I purchased another, more expensive flight through different city and went back home. It's almost a year and Bulgaria Air still didn't refund me my money. I tried to explain them that since they didn't operate the flight I purchased ticket for, they have no rights to keep my money. They give me some lame explanations that it takes them longer time to return money or that I can reschedule that ticket for another flight. Which one, I am asking, when whole Europe is locked at the moment. I don't want to travel, I just want my 200 euros back.

### "reputation and customers is not what you value"
Booked a flight for 12.10.2020 and today, a day before I receive the cancellation of the flight. This year it has happened to me multiple times and I had to spend a fortune on buying new tickets to finally fly away. None of the Airlines I used ever refunded money so far and today I am in the same situation again, when none of the airline reps can clearly explain what is going on! How long this is going to continue? Covid is the reason? Are we going to use it as an excuse everytime and everywhere? How come that overnight everything so of a sudden changes, today is safe, tomorrow is dangerous (presumably), according to the logic of the airlines? Why, if it's so you simply don' t sell tickets and don't fool people into spending their hard earned money into something that is not guaranteed? If you cannot refund straight away, and it's a shame that 6 months wasn't enough for you to come up with some kind of solution for this then I believe your reputation and customers is not what you value! Of course, I can make it my last flight this year or even next. I think it's time for some changes from the customers side! This is ridiculous.

### "ashamed of our national carrier"
I have flown with Bulgaria Air more than 15 times. Mainly because on the routes I flew I didn’t have a better alternative at that certain moment. However, I don’t think I had a flight with them that didn’t have some kind of problem. Once I had to transport my dog and when we landed the ground crew returned the dog cage broken! (They obviously had dropped it while my dog was inside). Once I bought a ticket and I had to travel  for business. When I tried to do the check-in it turned out there is an error in the system and the ticket didn’t exist. Imagine the surprise I felt when I had to buy a 2x more expensive ticket just hours before departure. But maybe the worst thing was when I had to fly from Lisbon back to Bulgaria and just hours before the flight I got an email that it got cancelled. Just a regular day with Bulgaria air. I am Bulgarian, travel a lot and honestly am ashamed of our national carrier. If you have a chance, fly with any other airline just not BG air.

### "incompetent staff and slow email"
Not Verified |  My ID expired abroad in Germany during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The Bulgarian government extended the due date on all passports by 6 months and the German government recognized this measure. I wanted to book a flight from Frankfurt to Sofia and the only airline flying was Bulgaria Air. I tried booking my flight but the site of the aforementioned airline didn't allow me to book it because of my expired ID. I tried to contact them by phone 2 times. One was outside their working hours, understandable, even tho what kind of airline can't afford a 24/7 customer support? The second time I waited in line for 3 minutes and the system told me that they were unable to get in touch with me and I should contact them through email. Still ok, I contacted them in hope that they will provide a solution. To be frank, they did. It wasn't the solution I expected tho. They wanted me to send them my data so they could make the booking and then told me that it would cost 80 euros more than the original price of the ticket when I tried to book it. I, of course, told them that this isn't my fault and I shouldn't be charged 80 euros more because their system wasn't up to date with the measures taken by the Bulgarian and German governments. I waited for a day but didn't receive an answer. I decided to try to contact them once more on the phone and to my surprise they answered. The lady on the phone didn't even know that there is no way to get a new ID right now since the offices are closed and had no idea that you could travel with an expired card. I had to explain all that and then she still told me that it wasn't their fault and it is my fault. You should have made a reservation with the expiration date one year in the future" she said. I'm sorry but that would be a lie, if not against the law. The responsibility of submitting wrong data about my ID on my own would certainly be mine. Customer service: ZERO, incompetent staff and slow email answers. In the end, I am glad that I never flied with them and certainly never will.

### "Safety standards a bit lax"
Not Verified |  Larnaca to Sofia. On-time departure and a fairly pleasant crew. Safety standards a bit lax, e.g. the passenger in front of me had her seat reclined during boarding as well as takeoff. The crew said nothing to her. No entertainment of any kind. The fare on this route seems quite pricey - several hundred euros for a two-hour segment. Where the airline really needs to up its game is in online booking and communication. E.g. why accept and acknowledge my online request for a Muslim Meal, only to follow it up a couple days later with a confusing, fine-print email saying "we may not be able to accommodate your request", and finally, when on board, hand out the same pork sandwich to all passengers? (Even then, the ingredients were only listed on the packaging in Bulgarian, and in microscopic font.) Bulgaria is a leader in IT, but you'd never know it by interacting with their national airline.

### "had a very good flight"
Sofia to Madrid. We had a very good flight- check in was quick, the flight attendants were very courteous and the flight took off and landed on schedule. Plane was clean and well maintained except the livery paint job was a little worn. I would not hesitate to fly them again.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Tel Aviv via Sofia . I booked my tickets through Opodo in Business Class and then when I did the Check-In it became clear that there was no Business Class on the aircraft. So, I had to fly Economy and additionally I had to pay for my extra luggage (2 bags are included in the Business Tarif). I received a very small refund for the wrong booking class from Opodo, and I was told, Bulgaria Air is directly responsible for refunding me my money for the extra bag. I am trying to get a hold of them for 4 months now. No reply so far. Worst customer service ever!

### "I feel tricked and insulted"
Sofia to Varna. This is the worst airplane company ever. I am using this company for many times unfortunately since there is no other option for internal flights, and I have had many bad experiences. First of all, this summer there was a delay w/ 7 hours. I came 40min prior the flight when I was told that the flight will have a delay w/ 2 hours. After 2 hours when the time came for boarding, ppl started to go on line, one person came and told us that the flight will have another 5 hours delay ... it will actually depart at around 21:30, not even for sure. Today, I am standing here at the airport and waiting again because I was late. I came 40 min prior my flight departure, and the worker told me I was late. The gate is already closed. Supervisor at this time of shift was rude, screaming, and gave me really hard time. I had to buy another ticket for later flight, because I did not have a choice. We leave in 21 century, and I still cannot believe that this can happen. I feel tricked and insulted.

### "I would take them again"
Sofia to Amsterdam. I think they deserve three stars based on my flight. I had booked this flight because Adria had gone bankrupt. Two days before departure, I find this flight, quite a good price given the fact that I was leaving two days later. Seat was comfortable, we left a bit late but that's OK. I forgot to request my meal during booking, I sent an e-mail and someone answered me in a matter of hours. Food was pretty good although I can't judge for certain. I would take them again.

### "nice for short haul flight"
I've always flown with them, and they're nice for short haul flight. Welcome on board with a bottle and after that given a small sandwich compare to other airlines which will even make you pay for it. Sometimes they do have delays but which airlines doesn't? For the price your paying I think its worth it, I've always picked them in front of other companies.

### "flight felt like an eternity"
Sofia to Lisbon. This four hour flight felt like an eternity. Legroom was better than on their A320s but still insufficient. I emptied the pocket in front of my so there would be more space available. Food was good but not enough. There are no pillows on Bulgaria Air. Landed on time.

### "My biggest problem however was legroom"
Lisbon to Sofia with Bulgaria Air. Tasty sandwich served onboard along with complementary bottle of water on boarding which is a nice touch however for a four hour flight it didn't seem enough. The aircraft seemed very old and almost decrepit with very worn out leather seats. It was the first time I feared for safety when travelling. There was much turbulence on departure from Portugal. Cabin crew were young and rather unprofessional. They seemed as if they wouldn't want to be bother. The flight departed and landed precisely on time. My biggest problem however was legroom which made this night flight atrocious.

### "Absolutely unacceptable"
Not Verified | Varna to Sofia. Flight delayed 4 hours with no explanation. Absolutely not acceptable. Do not recommend. My time not valued. Worst company ever. Do not recommend. Absolutely unacceptable paid £70 to get quicker instead spend extra 4 hours in the airport.

### "not use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Sofia to Varna. Flight was delayed now for two hours. No explanation was given. Customer service was horrible. Apparently flights have been running late for the whole summer. If I knew in advance I would have taken a bus or train. Will not use this airline again. Very bad service!

### "Bulgaria air get my vote"
Bulgaria air have the values of BA 2 decades ago. A bottle of water when you step onboard - inflight sandwich and drinks free of charge and accompanied by a little chocolate. Relaxed atmosphere. Well dressed crew with a good(all be it a little relaxed) attitude. Overall, Bulgaria air get my vote. Also when flying business, don’t worry about baggage rules or anything like that.

### "never been seated so miserably"
Brussels to Sofia. I am flying since many years worldwide and I have never been seated so miserably. Absolutely avoid sitting on a window seat in the back of the plane, especially if you are taller than 1.70cm and weigh more than 90kg. I felt like being pressed into the space between the seat in front of me and the frustrated passenger in the back of me. On the ticket they print "The National Symbol of Flying"  what a bad joke, never again!

### "Seat pitch is lousy"
Sofia to Amsterdam. Checkin and security were fast for our 7 o’clock morning flignt. Sofia airport is not that big, so it took us less than 15 minutes from arriving by cab to the seating area at the gate. Flight was almost full and boarding took a while mainly to oversized hand luggage of some passengers. I was in seat 3F. Seat pitch is lousy, it seems even less than 29 inch. Crew was friendly, serving a ham cheese ciabatta and a drink, coffee or tea and a chocolate later during the flight. Arrival was on time, luggage took too long to arrive,

### "staff was very friendly"
Not Verified | I have flew from Sofia to Frankfurt and the service was great. The seats were comfortable and the lounge was great. They give us big sandwich with ham and cheese which was warmed (unlike Lufthansa), soft drink, beer or wine and a chocolate for a dessert. The staff was very friendly. At the airport I didn't have to wait a lot.

### "Very good value for money"
I flew Vienna - Sofia return with Bulgaria Air in October 2018 and I had a wonderful experience. Tickets were cheap and service was really nice. Both flights were on time, even half an hour early on the way back. Crew really nice and professional, attentive and friendly. Onboard service was included in the price, small water was handed out upon boarding, and later on a beverage of choice, a tasty sandwich and chocolate. Cabin was clean, seats are very comfy. Very good value for money, highly recommend!

### "This is the worst airline"
Beirut to Sofia. This is the worst airline. My journey was delayed by 14 hours and I have been trying to reach out to the complaint team in vain. Their lines are always busy and they haven't replied to my mail after more than 2 months following this message. Your documents will be processed within the statutory period of two months". Does anyone know how they can be reached?

### "flight was very pleasant"
Sofia to Amsterdam. I flew with Bulgaria Air last April. At the gate the stewardess that was checking the tickets told me I got a upgrade to business. When we entered the plane a A320 around 15 years old we were created I was seated at the second row of business class. At the seat a bottle of mineral water. When we reached our cruising altitude the stewardess came with the food. For the business class we had a traditional Bulgarian breakfast with Banisa yogurt and some fruites. It was very tasty! The flight itself was very pleasant. After landing in Amsterdam the stewardesses said good bye after disembarking.

### "there is no leg room"
Flew Bulgaria Air from Amsterdam to Sofia. Endless boarding due to too much hand luggage, 1.5 hours delayed of course due to weather and this airline believes its passengers don’t have legs as there is no leg room at 30c and I am 1.87m. Price reasonable and can not collect points with other frequent flyer cards, booking on internet no AMEX accepted.

### "enjoyable and normal experience"
Beirut to Sofia. The flight was  okay. It departed on time, the cabin crew did a great job indeed. The food was simple but for a midnight flight it was alright. I was seated on an emergency exit seat and it was very comfortable there. The other seats in front seemed like they have a great legroom too. Calm, enjoyable and normal experience.

### "another good experience"
Bulgaria Air is definitely the best choice to fly from Sofia to Milan and back. Brand new aircraft and good service. Arrived at the airport 1h.30min. before the flight and went straight to the business class check in desk, as a Silver member. Security was very fast. This time the boarding was organised. It was a full flight. I was able to change my seat to an extra legroom seat in Row 3 (up to 2.5 times more legroom than economy) and it costs 20€ more each way. I would say that these extra legroom seats are better than any intra European business class. We took off on time. Snacks were given to all passengers (a small sandwich, drinks and a chocolate). We landed in Sofia on time. I would say that I had another good experience with Bulgaria Air.

### "flight was very pleasant"
Sofia to Milan on Bulgaria Air’s Embraer 190. As I am a Silver member in their frequent flyer program, FlyMore, I checked in on the business class counter, which saved me time, as sometimes the economy class lines are long. There is no priority fast lane at Sofia airport and my status doesn’t allow lounge access. Boarding was disorganised. The flight was full, but I had a seat in the front. Bulgaria Air also offers extra legroom seats in row 3 (behind business class). They offer up to 2.5 times more legroom for 20€ more each way. The flight was pleasant. There was a snack served (a sandwich and a chocolate). We landed in Milan 20 minutes earlier. Overall the flight was very pleasant. I like to use Bulgaria Air for short-haul flights.

### "Worst airline ever"
Sofia to Prague. Worst airline ever. Even worse than Wizz or Ryanair. Been redirected 3 times to different check in counters, made to queue up again each time. No apologies from arrogant and rude staff. Will never fly with them again. Worst service and attitudes. Why even bother running a company with such service level?

### "there is no reason to choose this airline"
Flew Bulgaria Air from Tel Aviv to Varna and return. 4 hours delay, every hour they updated with another delay. Old aircraft and bad service. Once we arrived to the aircraft we spent another 30 minutes without air conditioning. Unless the price is very low comparing the rest there is no reason to choose this airline.

### "do not buy tickets from this airline"
Sofia to Barcelona. I strongly recommend that you do not buy tickets from this airline. I was supposed to fly from Sofia to Barcelona today, June 27 2017, leaving Sofia at 10 am, arriving 12 pm. As of now, 4:20 pm, there is no information at all when the flight would leave, where is the plane currently, and whether it will leave at all. The electronic board simply says the flight is delayed, the person at the gate says there is no information available to him, and the web cite of Bulgaria air does not mention the flight at all under "flight status". The personel at the gate is supposed to at least provide water and snacks to the passengers waiting all day, but every time we tried to approach them, they said that we should wait to be called for food, not go and ask for it... We ended up visiting the airport restaurant for breakfast, lunch, and we are headed there for dinner as well since no one knows when or if the flight will leave. We asked if we can be rebooked to RyanAir, which also had a direct flight to Barcelona one hour later at 3:55 pm - we had no checked in luggage and the flight was already delayed 5 hours but the customer service representative was very rude and told me that the airline does not do that, we just have to keep waiting. In the meanwhile, significant delayed were announced over the loud speaker for several other Bulgaria Air flights. All Ryanair flights, on the other hand, were on time.

### "cabin service is okay"
Flew from Sofia to Paris. The Embraer planes of Bulgaria Air are okay. The seats are pretty old but the spacing is okay. The airbus planes are worse. The seats are older (rubbed off leather, torn pouches etc) and the spacing is uncomfortably tight. Cabin service is okay. Food is pretty simple but the staff are usually quick. There is no onboard entertainment on any of the planes.

### "Don't fly Business Class"
I was flying Business Class from Sofia to Frankfurt. I wasn't offered welcome drink and the so called 'food' is a miserable sandwich - same one offered in Economy. What's funny is that Economy gets bottles of water on their seats and Business didn't! Ridiculous. The chocolate is not edible. In Sofia we boarded a bus to take us to the airplane, which is unpleasant. In Frankfurt we landed so far away from the gates, we travelled 20 minutes by bus! Don't fly Business Class with this airline.

### "the flight was very pleasant"
Varna to Sofia. Very nice flight. Business class check in was very slow - first it opened 1h 30mins before the flight and then the computer stopped working, so waited there for about 25 minutes. The lounge in Varna is great, I believe the best one in Bulgaria. The business class cabin was totally full - 8 seats, as well as economy class. They didn't offer welcome drinks, not like my previous flights on the Bulgaria Air business class. The seats are comfortable and also a little bit wider then the economy ones. The food was a cold beverage, but was tasty. The flight landed on time. Overall, the flight was very pleasant.

### "an easy, enjoyable flight"
Sofia to Brussels with Bulgaria Air. The check-in line at Sofia Airport was long, but it moved quickly, as did the security check. Staff was courteous and efficient. Upon entering the plane, we were given a bottle of water, which was later followed by a sandwich and a choice of hot and cold beverages. We left on time and arrived at our destination on time. Cabin staff was friendly and professional. An easy, enjoyable flight.

### "a little bit slow"
I flew Bulgaria Air E190 from Sofia to Varna two weeks ago. The seat was Ok, the only food - chocolate - also, the service, a little bit slow, but overall was good. The flight was 30 minutes late and they made us get out of the plane and sit in the bus because they had to do a check.

### "No complaints with Bulgaria Air"
FB431 on 30 June from Sofia to Paris CDG. Check-in lines were long but for baggage drop it was quicker and they let you use the Business Class counter. Bag tagged to Paris and thru security and immigration to the gate. Boarding was via bus on the tarmac - strange as only 3 of the 10+ jet bridges were occupied. 2 buses filled up the plane. Greeted upon boarding and the attendants checked everyone boarding pass. Bottle of water in the seat for each passenger. Departed on-time and smooth flight. Drink service 2 x and a snack provided (similar to the DUS-SOF flight I was on a few days earlier). Landed on-time in Paris and off the plane quickly - bags took a bit long but overall good flight. No complaints with Bulgaria Air - very nice service and on-time flights for a good price.

### "nice welcome from flight crew"
Dusseldorf to Sofia on 28 July. Online check-in is available but on their webpage is says it isn't from DUS - but it was and got my seat and BP quickly. Checked my bag at the counter - friendly agent but she was from an airport company - not Bulgaria air. Boarded by bus - full plane but people were organized and no pushing. Nice welcome from flight crew; bottle of water for each passenger was already in their seat. Departed on-time. Seat comfort is perfect - plenty of knee-room. 2 hour 30 min flight and was served a turkey and cheese sandwich, chocolate and a drink run. No in-flight entertainment but was watching my DVD's so didn't matter. Landed on time and jet-bridge into the terminal (which is new and easy to naviagate). Immigration was quick and friendly and bags were on the belt soon. Good flight!

### "another pleasant flight"
Another pleasant flight with Bulgaria Air from Varna to Sofia. It's a regional airline, but still very good. I liked how nice the cabin crew were and how professional the pilots were. The food was not so nice, it was just a snack. Otherwise I like the airline and I recommend it.

### "seat was comfortable"
Another flight with Bulgaria Air from Sofia to Varna. Service in Sofia is always nice. Only noriority fast track, but that's OK. The Bulgaria Air lounge was perfect, as well as the flight. The food was nice, the crew as well. Seat was comfortable. Only two of us in Business Class, which was very good.

### "never again Bulgaria Air"
Never again I will book Bulgaria Air. We booked in October 2015 7 tickets to fly the 1st June 2016 to Sofia for a citytrip. They already changed a few times the hours of the flight. The return was to be in the evening and now they changed it to 6amin the morning. And last week they changed the depart from 9am in the morning to 20.25 in the evening. So we lose 2 days of our city trip. Never again!

### "crew was friendly"
I flew Bulgaria Air economy class from Varna to Sofia on an A319. Overall the flight was good. The food was okay, the crew was friendly. The plane wasn't full, so most of the passengers had three seats only for themselves, and the seat was comfortable.

### "trip itself was very nice"
My trip to Sofia on the 19th of December went very well, from the staff to the good trip and beverages. However the plane does not have any IFE which is a pity because we could use one of them to watch movies and play games. Bulgaria Air does offer their SkyMagazine that was very nice. The staff at the arrival however were not nice and were very impatient and angry. I think the trip itself was very nice just some little things that could make it better

### "the skis were refused"
We booked a ski vacation to Bulgaria and during the online booking at the official Bulgaria Air website we specifically ckecked the box indicating we would bring skis with us. On the way from Amsterdam to Sofia there was no problem to check in our skis. On the way back from Sofia however the skis were refused. We needed a special document and had to pay an additional €30 - which we could obtain somewhere at the airport. If we would have followed that procedure we would have missed our flight (huge lines for check-in which costed us already 40 minutes) so we decided to leave the skis behind at the airport. It is amazing how they treat their customers. Complaining is useless, they just keep on repeating their mantra of rules. Ridiculous that ckecking in skis in Amsterdam is no problem but on the way back they are simply refused. Don't fly this airline if you want to bring something special or want be treated as a human being.

### "they use modern planes"
We booked the flight with Bulgaria Air because it was 50% less than Austrian Airlines, however, we were surprised by the fact that they use modern planes (the Embraer 90 was built in 2012), given some food (Sandwich, Chocolate, a bottle of water on the seat and one additional drink during the flight) and by the friendly cabin. The announcements by the crew were in Bulgarian and English and the English from the cabin crew and pilot was quite good.

### "how miserable flight attendants were"
Flew from Sofia to LHR with Bulgaria Air. This route is served by Easyjet, Wizz, British Airways and Bulgaria Air. Having tried the rest this company is by far the worst of the lot. Check in attendants were pleasant and efficient. The gate however was from 6 which means that you wait downstairs for boarding where there is no wifi. We were bussed out to a rather dated and tatty A320. The seats and interior desperate for a refit. No briefings were given on use of emergency exit doors. There was no cross checking of doors being properly locked. and no greeting on arrival. We taxied out behind British Airways that departs at the same time. The announcements were not audible due to poor pa system and very poor English. Once airborne the Flight attendants proceeded with the food service. One roll which was out of date, and could have been used as a tennis ball. And one piece of chocolate. The food was literally chucked at you. I was offered wine which was terrible. No entertainment at all. The main thing that stuck with me however was how miserable the flight attendants were, they were not only rude, but just didn't smile the entire time. When I compare this airline with British Airways, who operate on the same route and serve a proper meal, with decent wine, and nice friendly flight attendants. Even Wizz and Easyjet are better than this miserable bunch.

### "suitcase was left in Rome"
My suitcase was left in Rome by Bulgaria Air. When I asked about how to get it to Sofia, I was informed it was not their fault and I needed to call them to find out when my suitcase was in Sofia. The phone number I received was never answered, and nobody answered my e-mails. I went back to the airport and I was told, rudely, that it was not their fault and they would bring my suitcase home. My suitcase arrived from Rome but was never delivered to my address and nobody called me with information. Next day, I drove again to the airport after trying to reach them by e-mail and phone, receiving no answer. My suitcase was there but I had to prove, through many documents, who I was. All this in a very rude manner, as if I was interrupting their work and was asking for something extraordinary. The whole time I was treated as if I had no right to ask for my suitcase.

### "would fly with them again"
The staff at the Bulgaria Air office in Sofia, at the airport and onboard the flight were very helpful and friendly. The cabin service was excellent. My wife is a bit scared of flying and the flight was very smooth and well managed. I would fly with them again.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Flew last week from Vienna to Sofia in Economy and was a lot more satisfied than last time - the aircraft was cleaner and better maintained, cabin crew were a lot more attentive, and the catering has slightly improved (the sandwich accompanied by the chocolate). On-time departure and landing. The cost of a one-way ticket was €130, which I found perfect! The plane was fully booked in Economy, whereas Business class was almost empty.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
I fly Bulgaria Air frequently due to the fact that they are without competition on many routes from Sofia. I do not agree with many of the utterly negative opinions about Bulgaria Air. For the 50 something flights I have had with them in the last year, there were no major delays. I last flew on the internal flight VAR-SOF-VAR. The aircraft was one of their new Embraers. However, it did surprisingly look worn out. Boarding started with a delay of twenty minutes, yet we landed on time in Varna. The crew was, as per the general rule in Bulgaria Air, surly. It seemed that the best I could get from them was ignorance. Service was adequate - a chocolate bar and a soft drink. The flight was completely booked so it was amazing how three flight attendants distributed drinks and snacks to 100 people within twenty minutes. The seat comfort was quite ok and I am really not a small man. The best part of the flight was the captain who gave a very entertaining announcement during the flight. All in all, a very decent airline - not the best but not the worst. I would recommend them again.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
The flight arrived in Paris with enough time for passengers to disembark and catch connecting flights. But the wrong stairs were brought over to the plane delaying us 20 minutes and allowing staff from Bulgaria Air to arrive with signs telling us our connecting flight was delayed. I checked the flight status on line and saw that this was not true but the bus we were loaded on had already taken us out of the terminal and over to a hotel zone. There was no further communication from Bulgaria Air about rebooking the flight. When I came back to the airport the next day the staff gave me a call center # to get rebooking info packed their things and walked off. I finally got back to USA but my checked luggage is still missing.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
I was supposed to have a flight from Varna to Moscow departing at 17.20. When I arrived to the airport 2 hrs in advance I could not find my flight in the list. On information desk they said tha my flight was rescheduled from 17.20 to 20.35. There was no sign of delay on the schedule screen and at 14.00 there were no notices about the delay on the company's site - it appeared much later. The contact center could not comment the delay and sent to the company's representative in Varna Airport. In the airport they could not provide any information either. Later on we discovered that due to the low volume of passengers our flight was combined with the flight going from Tel-Aviv to Varna via Burgas (which of course, the company was aware of much in advance). No services were forseen for the passengers in delay. A lot of passengers were with small babies and with connecting flights to other destinations from Moscow. There were at least two options for such passengers to depart earlier with other companies but Bulgaria Air refused to change tickets saying that the flights were fully booked and there were no tickets (while there were tickets available on the sites of these companies). After a 1.5 hours of battle with Bulgaria Air representative, they agreed to provide water and a sandwich. But they provided no sitting places for the passengers and no check-in till 18.35. So that the passengers had to organize on their own at least to safeguard the luggage (so that single moms and other travellers could go to bathroom or caffeteria without bags). Just some time before 20.35 they re-scheduled the flight again - till 21.00. But at 21.00 the only airplane in the airport departed for Minsk (not for Moscow) leaving small kids and their families on the ground on their feet for over 5 hrs by that time. As a matter of fact the company organized additional juice and water distribution to passengers - this was instead of hot meals and hotels which the company refused to provide. At 21.00 there was a notice on Bulgaria Air official site that the flight had departed at 20.35. The company representative appeared at 21.15 - after the passenger riot explaining that the plane would land from Tel-Avive at 21.10 and depart from Burgas at 21.30 and assured that it would depart for Moscow at 22.20 (which does not seem to be feasible). Still waiting for resolution.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Very happy result of the flights (round trip), very smiley cabin crew with traditional Bulgarian hospitality and good food. For a short trip it was very comfortable, leather seats, with a 2-2 seat configuration it was better as there was more space individually and for once not two halfs of two different windows like on an Airbus but a window for every passenger having that kind of seat. On the return the A319 was very clean and mostly new with more female flight attendants than the inbound flight, very cool as well just one minor problem, please clean the magazine pouches. There was gum on the Airbus in them.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Have used the internal flight Sofia to Burgas a number of times over the last three years. Last trip was three weeks ago. Fantastic value for money. I find its the best transport mode for connecting the Capital to the Black Sea.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
SOF-LHR Return. First and last time travelling on Bulgarian Air. Staff on both legs rude but especially so on the return. Boarding was chaos. It was not boarded by number everyone just pushed forward. Legroom is crazy luckily we had exits out and bulk head on the way back. Sat at the front I could see what was happening in the galley area and out of 5 staff only 2 did anything the rest sat talking at the front. The meal was a bread roll with 1 slice of cheese and 1 tiny slice of rolled chicken same on both legs. On both flights we were delayed an hour. To sum up poor on all accounts and we avoid them in the future.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
SOF-ATH on E190 even though the plane was delivered in 2012 looks older. The head rests do not have paper cover; on seats you will find a bottle of water. During the 1 hour flight they offered sandwich refreshments or wine and coffee / tea with a bar of chocolate. Staff was professionals. Flight was on time actually 10 minutes early because boarding was completed with 100% load factor. Great ticket cost (compare to competitors) and worth flying with them.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
I flew from Berlin Tegel (TXL) to Sofia (SOF) and return (A320 and A319 respectively). Water bottles were put on the seat before take-off. The service included a small sandwich (nothing fancy but the taste was ok) a piece of chocolate tea/coffee and a soft drink beer or vine. The staff was quite friendly and I felt welcomed on board. Both flights had a delay of around 15 minutes which is perfectly normal. The only drawback was that both planes were old and the seats rather worn. But overall I had a pleasant experience and will fly with Bulgaria Air again.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Flew Madrid - Sofia on an Embraer 190 and Sofia - Madrid on an Airbus A319. Excellent value for money. Both flights were on time and landed before scheduled time of arrival. Free piece of checked baggage and nice services inflight: sandwich chocolate water and two rounds of free drinks (coke coffee milk tea beer wine). It would be nice to have some entertainment on board but it is a minor problem. Will repeat if I come back to Bulgaria.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
I flew on 20 December 2014 on Bulgaria Air from Vienna to Sofia. Given other reviews about this airline I was concerned about flying BG Air at first and was in the end decently surprised about the flight - My flight was operated by an Airbus A319. The flight attendants were extremely kind and helpful yet spoke below average English. The food on board consisted of an extremely tasty sandwich accompanied by a chocolate as Dessert which was also tasty. Two rounds of drinks were served on this flight. The flight was full and uneventful. The aircraft required better cleaning. Overall I'd fly Bulgaria Air again but they really need to improve their services on board as well as other minor products despite their cheap airfares.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Not really pleased. I usually travel from Sofia to London Heathrow and back. The delays are usual. Complete lack of entertainment. There is lack of space too.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
I fly 2-3 times a year ZRH-SOF-VAR. There is always delays and as a rule last-minute changed schedule causing 4-8 hours unplanned/unexpected delay. I have logged an official complaint with the company and with national authorities but all in vain. I'll try not to use this company anymore. There are at least two other alternatives for the same flight if this is how it is going to be in the future.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Fly often from SOF-ATH and opposite and I am really satisfy with BG air. They have new modern airplanes friendly staff very good prices comparing to other companies that make the same route passable menu and they are really punctual even arriving before expecting time. For short distances is totally worth flying.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Flew Sofia - Rome London - Sofia and Frankfurt - Sofia. Airline has greatly improved - aircraft are new clean and with pleasant ambience. Staff were always very professional polite and extremely pleasant - at the same time not too polite. Food is ok - nothing special but not different than many other even 4-star airlines on short- haul. Flights were always on time. Only improvement potential is larger legroom - can be a bit tight for taller people on a 2-hour flight.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
I have flown from Paris CDG to Sofia with an Embraer 190. Nice staff serving excellent food. Nevertheless the legroom in the first business row is quite bad.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
LHR to SOF Airbus 320. Good fare staff friendly on-time flight. Nice that there's a bottle of water at your seat and you later receive a free sandwich. But the worse leg room I've ever encountered on a plane. I'm 6 ft (183cm) and the metal bar of the spring-loaded seat pocket jammed uncomfortably into my knee cap.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
I flew with them from Copenhagen to Burgas and return and were not very pleased with the flight. The first flight was delayed 40 minutes but then nothing happened I waited there for 3 hours and the only information we got was that they were doing a security check 3 hours is a long time to be in a gate with nothing to eat and no information at all. When we finally got on board the plane was very old. When we were about to land the stewardess told me to switch off my phone - which I did but then I looked behind and she was sitting on her iPhone. On the return flight we were 40 minutes delayed again with no information again and the staff was not very friendly. I would not recommend this to anyone.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Flight 461 - July 10 2014 SOF-AMS Business Class. Very nice 2.5 hour flight. Flight attendant was very good and the breakfast was hot and tasty. I would definitely rate this far superior to the business class I fly in the USA.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
ZRH-SOF. No delays quite interesting flight magazine charming attendants. Overall really pleasant 2 hours flight.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
FB491 (Sofia to Zurich) Feb 4th 2014. They changed the schedule for a 7.30am flight to 11am the night before the flight. Note that this was a permanent schedule change - not a one off delay due to something unexpected. No notice was sent out to notify passengers of this change. I had to wake up at 3am to get to Sofia Airport just to find out that I have to wait 4 hours. The airline staff at the airport were rude and offered no assistance - 'just go there and wait'. In addition the food on the flight was quite bad - they only offer sandwiches which are so pre-processed that they look as if they can last for months without getting spoiled. Very poor service.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Flew from Sofia to Rome. Very rude crew staff. No one smiled. When the plane was landing one of the flight attendants came up to ask me to close the table (I was sleeping so I didn't hear the announcement). I did what she told me then asked her to take my glass of water. She told me to keep it and just walked away before I could open my mouth to protest.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Excellent experience AMS-SOF-AMS in summer 2013. On time clean aircraft. Cabin crew was not excessively polite yet punctual and efficient. Appreciated newspapers and small sandwich kit.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Sofia to LHR friendly cabin crew sandwich and beer on board. Reached destination on-time. Good airlines deserve at least 3 Star rating better than many 3 Star airlines.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
This airline lacks basic customer services and fails to apply the same procedures across its offices - in our travel we were allowed to take 3 bags with one being heavier than 23kg on the way to Bulgaria but not on the way back. We have two small children and we travel usually with less number of bags as it makes things easier. The airlines have been very understanding and never had problems with travelling with one suitcase for all four for example. We had an awful episode at the airport and we found the airline being bureaucratic and unhelpful. We had seats problems both ways - a seat in front of us was broken which resulted in the lady in front almost laying on my daughters lap and I sat on a broken seat on the way back. We wouldn't recommend Bulgaria Air services.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
SOF-CDG. Spotless E190 aircraft. I find its 2x2 layout very comfortable with leather seats. Departure slightly late but arrival on time. A sandwich for breakfast and a drink which is pretty standard nowadays. I would say it is 3-star standard.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
I've flown Bulgaria Air several times from Scotland ie Glasgow and Aberdeen and the punctuality has been spot on every time 20kg allowance you don't get charged for putting your luggage in the hold all in all very good service. My wife and I will be flying to Bourgas on 24th June from Glasgow so looking forward to the flight again.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Flight SOF to VAR (economy) - have not used Bulgaria Air in few years but I needed one way domestic flight hence they were the only option. Flight left on time landed earlier. Check in was great free WiFi at the airport (different area for domestic flights) security was fast. Once at Varna (terminal needs upgrade but was told there is new one next to it that would be open in 2013) the baggage came fast and no issues. Overall very happy with the quick flight and will use again.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Varna-Sofia FB0980 4 May 2013. Very bad experience! A huge delay - more than 8 hrs. No information no compensation no apology. Rather rude behaviour of local agent of FB office at Varna airport. Poor service on board.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
SOF-LHR on A319. Flight on-time sandwiches good (and had separate vegetarian option) choice and quality of drinks good and staff polite and efficient. No complaints at all and would definitely fly with Bulgaria Air again.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Heathrow to Sofia. A very crowded flight but good staff if not overly friendly. More or less on time. Good drink service and food okay. I think Air Bulgaria need more flights at Heathrow though as this was rammed. Newspapers circulated but no English ones on a flight out of London? Another dislike is the setbacks had very narrow rigid space for storing stuff meaning you were limited to one or two magazines but no space for water books etc.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
MXP-SOF-MXP. Outbound flight with BAe 146 not very new but still ok. Compared to other aircraft's of the same model the legroom was very good and the seats more comfortable. Crew not very talkative but professional. On the way back brand new EMB-190: very nice plane but with smaller legroom compared to LOT and Air Dolomiti that use the same aircraft. Much friendlier crew. The food was correct and consisted of a sandwich and a small bar of chocolate which is ok for a 2 hrs flight. Upon boarding offered a bottle of water. On both ways smooth boarding. In general it was relaxing travel and the price was acceptable 200 EUR with a late booking.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
ZRH-SOF with a brand new Embraer E190. Quick boarding and flight was on time. Cabin crew was friendly. Served light lunch consisting of a sandwich drinks and complimentary chocolate. Smooth flight and landing in Sofia. Ultimately worth the 250 CHF ticket price recommended airline.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Legroom in economy on the (almost new) Airbus 319 is terrible unless you are really short - I didn't think they made planes with such a tight configuration any more. FA are completely hit and miss. Wine "service" is non-existent. Pretty dreadful really.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Two return flights on Brussels-Sofia route. One on a clean A319 the other Embraer 190. Staff friendly and helpful good selection of drinks onboard. Sandwiches were not bad at all. If tall try to get an aisle seat next to the emergency exit in the middle of the plane. As another review mentioned online check-in is limited only to flights taking off from Sofia which is a lack in these times. All in all not a bad service and I'll fly again.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Overall satisfied - very friendly and professional crew good onboard service. The only thing which can be pointed out as negative are the old British Aerospace plains which operate the internal flights - small and crowded. Recently have spotted the new Embraer 190 jets I am sure this will improve the overall quality of their fleet.

SOF-FRA-SOF. I Flew Bulgaria Air many times before but this was one of the best flights. The cabin crew was friendly and helpful. I heard they are waiting for 11 new embraer 190 to upgrade their fleet. Looking forward to fly with them again.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Sofia-London Heathrow on A320. Accept no recline on last row (29) in economy but seats among the most uncomfortable I have been allocated as lumbar support was too firm and you felt it was pushing you out of the front of the seat. Cabin crew non-existent once snack service complete-remained at the back of the aircraft with the curtain closed for remainder of trip until 30/40 mins before landing. Made a 3 hour+ flight seem longer but at the end of the day it got us home.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Just completed my 4th flight between Sofia and Frankfurt over a 6 month period. How pleasant it is to be sitting in a real business class seat 2 x 2 with room to spread and not having my notebook screen crushed by the seat in front with drinks before takeoff and charming crew. All flights without exception have been right on time operated with new A319s. I only wish they'd operate the route more frequently so I could use them both ways.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
This airline uses the oldest planes I have ever flown. I use Bulgaria Air very often as I fly for business to Sofia from Athens and I have been disappointed several times. The cabin crew is ok but their cabins smell horrible. When there are less than 50 passengers for the route which is very often they bring in propeller aircraft's ATR-42 which almost double the time of the journey and offer much less cabin comfort. They change the departure time sometimes without any notification and as it may be up to 2 hours there is no refund of the paid money. For the quality of the meal and the seats I would absolutely agree with previous comments that it is unacceptable when the price paid is equal to this of Alitalia Lufthansa Air France etc.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Sofia to Brussels Economy. Sofia Terminal 2 is new and empty check-in easy and friendly. Good price and only Euro 50 for an additional piece of luggage (up to 20 kilos). No delay friendly new and clean plane OK seats free drinks including beer and wine free food but this one is basic (tasteless sandwich and chemical waffle). So a good value as a whole. Problem is the small pitch you cannot even open your laptop to work.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Two return flights on Amsterdam-Sofia route. Both times on a new and clean A319. Staff generally friendly and helpful good selection of drinks onboard. The worst thing is the small seat pitch- only 29''. The A319 in two-class configuration has 144 seats with 3 additional rows in Economy Class. The sandwiches they serve consist of tasteless bread and cheese. For 10 months between the 2 flights the food remained unchanged. Ground service is slow and staff inefficient. Online check-in is limited only to flights taking off from Sofia and going to particular destinations.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Sofia-Varna-Sofia several times this summer. None of the flights were on time. Average delay of 2-3 hrs is rather usual thing than an exception. No compensation is offered. I would try to avoid them in the future.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Sofia-Varna-Sofia my first time flying with FB and for 85 Euro return wasn't expecting much but pleasantly surprised. Check in for both flights was fast and as I am 2m tall was offered an aisle seat without asking. Service on the 40 min flights was good considering drinks and a croissant offered and crew were friendly. BAE146 was old but clean and appeared well maintained no problem flying with them again. Seat pitch was ok no different to other short haul.

ZRH-SOF. Flight on time good service onboard friendly staff. Aircraft a bit old. Good value for money.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
LGW-VAR Outgoing flight bumped twice before we even arrived at the airport then a technical failure so ended up flying at 2200 instead of 0830 - arrived 0400 with no public transport. Aircraft needed a good clean to fixtures and fittings cabin lights not working properly. Return flight very tatty and dirty lights again faulty. Seat pitch awful. Call centre staff in Sofia didn't do what we asked. Flight crew okay spoke English and Bulgarian. Quality of service that of Ryanair/Easyjet but full price tickets.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
ZRH-SOF clean A319. Cabin staff friendly and food was quite nice given the duration of flight. Legroom a bit on the short side. Overall quite satisfied with the flight.

TLV-SOF return A319. Good drinks service fairly friendly crew good info given by the captain in clear English. A nice unexpected bonus - I signed up for Bulgaria Air miles program (they don't partner with anyone else). The line to the check-in counters was huge in Sofia. They had (to my pleasant surprise) a check-in line for Frequent Flyer members not just Business.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Berlin to Sofia in a slightly aging though clean BAE 146. As the plane was full seating space was a bit tight. Plane on time crew reasonably friendly. Onboard service included two big sandwiches and a small piece of cake. Beverages non alcoholic and alcoholic (beer or wine) and offered in large quantities. Newspapers available but only in Bulgarian language. Overall a good experience.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Sofia-Burgas-Sofia. One of the cabin crew on the first leg of the journey seemed a little grumpy but the rest of the staff were all helpful and cheery. They did a magnificent job on the 40 minute flight distributing free juice coffee croissant and newspaper! The seating was a little cramped for width but as neither journeys were overly full it was ok. Might be a problem on a longer flight.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Brussels-Sofia return. 5 hrs delay old and dirty airplane. Poor service and legroom. Never again and will choose an airline where I have to make stops to bring me to Sofia.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Booked Bulgaria Air Moscow - Bourgas - Moscow for our family vacation. First they cancelled all Sunday flights so we had to fly out on Friday - we learned about it on Friday. The times were changed too. From comfortable 7pm from Moscow and 2pm to Moscow to 3am from Moscow and about 8pm to Moscow arriving at about midnight. And we are traveling with three kids. Bulgaria Air seems to be in business of causing inconvenience for this was a small one comparing to what was awaiting on our way back. They routed the flight from Bourgas to Moscow through Sofia. I thought this was not such a big deal especially when I saw that there would be just 50 minutes between the flights. However they made all of us go through the whole procedure: - claim our luggage; - check-in; and even - passport control. We had to go through security check on our way to the plane and some of the passengers had already opened their Duty Free bags from Bourgas Duty Free. When they asked what were they supposed to do now the answer was Put it in your luggage.It was quite a sight to see these poor fellows rushing back to check-in stands and asking for their luggage back. The check-in clerks had no way to claim it back - or so they said. We thought the airline would provide us with a meal since they extended the time of our flight from 2.5 to 6 hours. There was a cold sandwich and a cup of juice. That's it for a six-hour journey. The kids on the plane were going crazy - overtired hungry just exhausted. Nobody in Bulgaria Air cared enough to reserve the front seats for passengers with kids though this is a common practice for all major charter providers. All the way we were treated like a heard of sheep not like customers. As one passenger on this forum put it customer service is an alien concept for Bulgaria Air.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Frankfurt to Sofia return. The ground staff in Frankfurt and Sofia were very helpful and gave us the seats we requested. The flight to Sofia was a smaller plane and unmarked but it was clean and comfortable. We received a sandwich and dessert and drink selection offered was good. On return we flew a 737 and the leg room was very tight but luckily it was not a full flight and we were able to move around. We had a packed lunch with sandwich and cake and the same nice selection of drinks. The crew seemed courteous and responsive to requests. We left and arrived on time and we had no baggage problems on either end. All in all it was a good experience and I would fly Bulgarian Air again.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
This is a ridiculous airline very badly run! I flew them BFS-SOF-BFS in February and it was the most horrible flight I have ever been on. The space between the seats is nothing and I sat the 3+ hour flight with my knees jammed to the seat in front. The flight attendants were rude and kept obsessing over the stupid curtain between business and economy (there was no difference on this flight as it was a charter) and only did half the safety briefing on the outbound. The heat on the plane was unbearable and any time you asked for a drink of water the flight attendants would acknowledge your request but made no effort at all to fulfil it. Another person in my group went to the galley himself to get a drink after having asked the flight attendants several times. The flight attendants could barely crack a smile and they only time they spoke was to give an unenthusiastic hello as we were boarding or to stand in the aisle and wave their hands about while complaining about the amount of children in the aisle. The plane had no Bulgaria Air titles on it or anything to suggest that it was the country's national airline. While it was a new A320 and very quiet I found the seat layout ridiculous.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Just back from a skiing holiday in Bulgaria flew with Bulgaria Air. Very bad experience. Cabin crew were the grumpiest I have ever experienced - did not smile once during the whole flight. The plane was extremely old and had no logo on it at all. No room in seats completely squashed. On the return flight to Belfast I found a three foot long piece of plastic lying on the ground under my feet! Take off and landing extremely poor - never again.. Felt unsafe during the whole flight cabin crew have no english.

Sofia-Varna return. I was a little concerned about this flight after reading some of the comments but I had a positive experience. Both flights on time airliner was an Avro 146 which is OK for a 40 minute hop. Cabin crew friendly and with good english skills. On the contrary ground crew at both airports barely said "hello" to me and looked very bored.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
Sofia-Heathrow return. It's a matter of luck with Bulgaria Air. My flights were fine and the cabin crew pleasant. Food - small ham and cheese sandwich and a small cake and it's free. Drinks free and a good selection. My only complaint is not enough leg room. Sadly when my family flew Sofia-Heathrow a few weeks later things were different. They found a half-chewed sandwich in the seat pocket with a lump of chewing-gum on top! When they showed it to the attendant she remarked "Dirty English passengers from previous flight"! My family also complained about leg-room and stale food. So as I say it's a matter of luck. However I will use them again if the fare is competitive.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
SOF-Varna return in Business Class (operated by Hamus International Airlines). At SOF airport separate Business Class Security Check. Very nice lounge from where Business Class passengers are picked up and delivered to aircraft. Older AVRO Jet inside completely coloured with white paint. Very wide seats (mechanics a bit worn out) spacious leg room. Drink and Snack offered on 50 minutes flight. Very attentive and friendly staff. Present (bottle of wine and some cosmetics) on departure. A very good experience at € 230 for both ways in Business class!

### Bulgaria Air customer review
LHR-SOF My first flight on this airline chosen for price and convenience (dep LHR at 6pm). Check-in quick (no queues) and reasonably friendly (handling agent is Alitalia). Boarding by seat row smooth and efficient. Seat pitch not great but in my opinion no worse than on most other airlines these days. Friendly PAs. Departure and arrival were both on time. Rather long wait for luggage at SOF.

### Bulgaria Air customer review
LGW - Varna. This airline seems to have improved since I last flew with them a year ago. Fairly modern A320 plane (although completely unlabelled as Bulgaria Air as others here note) left and arrived on time staff friendly and efficient and snack/drinks ok (free after all! ).
