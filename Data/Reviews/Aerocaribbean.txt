Havana - Cayo Coco return. A one hour flight with an old ATR42 turboprop. Seats surprisingly comfortable and we were offered a free drink plus candy onboard. Nothing special but we arrived on time.

### Aerocaribbean customer review
Holguin to Havana last week. Okay apart from issuing duplicate boarding cards to different passengers. Return was in a turbo prop plane which was 1 hour late and was infested by cockroaches running along the floor overhead lockers and electrical ducts. The plane was generally dirty. Obvious lack of maintenance.

What a wonderful friendly airline. Flew with them Hholguin to Havana and back. Both flights only minor delays was served juice and a cake on this short internal flight safety demonstration was done.
