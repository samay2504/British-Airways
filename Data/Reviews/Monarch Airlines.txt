### "exceeded our expectations"
Gatwick to Venice. We were hesitant about this airline having read reviews, but booked it for the low price. I have to say the flight exceeded our expectations. Check-in and boarding were both an extremely smooth process. I think we were at the bag drop desk for a total of 2 minutes, and boarding was much quicker than with other low-frills airlines. We paid in advance for extra legroom seats (my partner is 6'7" so this is an essential for us) and were surprised by the amount of space and comfort. We sat at the front of the plane with plenty of room to stretch out (unlike Ryanair and EasyJet, whose exit row seats only have an extra inch or so). Flight took off and landed on time, and was far more comfortable than we'd anticipated. There are definitely some areas to be improved upon in terms of the pre-flight process - I have not come across any other airline in the past few years that makes you print out your own boarding pass rather than making it available electronically. It's also pretty irritating to be told you can't check in online unless you pay for it - this could potentially lead to long queues at the airport on the day. These points lower my overall score for the airline, but the flight experience itself was very pleasant.

### "below average quality plane"
Malaga to Birmingham. I booked this flight online one week before flying. I needed to book for 3 adults, one child and one infant. However, I found when checking prices it was cheaper make two separate bookings than the whole group at once! I booked for two adults, then another booking for one adult and two children. This is unbelievable! Also you aren't allowed to check in online until 24 hours before you fly, unless you book a seat for 11 euros each. Which is a bit impossible as you are in holiday at this point! Just another money making scam. However, we booked for free while in Spain, and our hotel were kind enough to print our boarding passes for us! The plane was clean, but the seating is just too cramped. My husband had sit with his knee protruding into the isle, and the trolley kept knocking him when going past. Food and drinks are too expensive, luckily we bought some snacks and refreshments from the departure lounge before leaving Malaga. The staff however are really helpful, and I'm sure they know it's not the comfortable of places to sit for 3 hours, and do make an effort in making people feel welcome and providing a good service. They were quick to help with the needs of my 18 month old. The pilot kept us informed of any changes, as we were experiencing a lot of turbulence. We were also informed as we approached the UK coastline and also times for arrival were given. The plus side, we didn't have any hold luggage and were able to check in infants pram at the departure gate. Meaning we didn't have to wait in the long bag check in queues. Overall, we paid premium prices for seats on a below average quality plane. Thanks to the stewards for their efforts in trying to compensate for this.

### "Crew are extremely rude"
One of the worst flying experiences ever. Seats so tight and packed in like sardines. Couldn't even get the tray down. Only airline I've been on that does not have decaf coffee (medical reasons) and when I provided my own sachet of coffee they wanted to charge me for the cup! Crew are extremely rude and have no time/don't care. Can see this airline going back into bankruptcy and I will never fly them again. Used to be one of the best, look how far you've fallen!

### "not be flying this airline again"
Las Palmas to Gatwick. The app doesn't allow for paperless tickets, they tell you to print them! What age are we in? They then charged €36 for an extra leg room seat and finally I paid €72 for two seats and the airline insisted under its t+c's that I use their exchange rate, and then stated 'customer chose to accept' the exchange rate. Daylight robbery, disingenuous and unacceptable. I will not be flying this airline again.

### "they get the basics right"
Gatwick to Lanzarote. Short queue at Gatwick check-in, staff were polite. Boarding process fine. Plenty of overhead locker space as flight not full. Departed about 20-30 mins late as 1 passenger failed to board and bags had to be found and removed from aircraft. Announcements from front of cabin and cockpit were clear. Announcements from rear of cabin totally unintelligible. Announcements in english only. Smooth flight. Cabin crew professional. No attempt at interaction with customers unless you wanted to buy something. Typical uncomfortable, hard, non-adjustable seats. Leg room was OK for a 1m 75cm adult. Clean aircraft. Clean, well stocked toilet when I used it. No bells and whistles but they get the basics right for the price paid. Would use again.

### "my flight had been cancelled"
Alicante to Manchester. I don't normally write reviews but the shocking service has left me no choice. The flight out to Alicante went without a hitch; it was only on my return flight that the nightmare unfolded. Arrived at the airport only to find out that my flight had been cancelled. I was ended a piece of paper by the Monarch Airlines representative and told to make my own arrangements and they would give me a full refund at a later date (that refund is just a little difficult to get hold of). No food vouchers, no aid in organising another flight /accommodation, no nothing. The piece of paper sent me to Swissport ticket sales who then sent me to Iberia. The only flight I could get back to Manchester was the next day. I had to organise my own accommodation for another night and fork out over 300 euros in total. To top it all off, I used a refund website to claim compensation and they have sent me an email saying Monarch Airlines have ignored my claim and they have to result to using legal action instead.

### "service described as bordering on rude"
The flight was ok, the landing smooth but the service can be described as bordering on rude. One lady at airport in Porto (Oporto) (flight Porto-Luton) was simply rude, she saw I had two bags half empty already prepared for having one over my head and another in front of my seat. She not only made me put one bag into another before getting on the plane but she also told me off for that and changed the shape of the gate excluding me from the queue when I was at the very front. Also, on my way to Porto, I wanted to ask a flight attendent if I could order some hot food so she could put it in oven (it takes some time to prepare) and she answered in a rather rude way that they don't serve at that stage. However, the pilots were very nice. I'm not really sure why but I would still recommend the airline.

### "FA's were attentive and ever present"
Flew Monarch from Birmingham to Funchal. Good flights both ways FA's were attentive and ever present. Lots of leg room in the extra leg room seats which cost an additional £57 so not particularly cheap but I think worth it for a 4 hour flight. I'm not particularly tall but there was a good 6 inches between my knees and the seat in from to me. On the return leg arrived 25 minutes early shame it was Birmingham 20 minutes to find steps to disembark the aircraft.

### "not extra leg room at all"
Flew Monarch Airlines from Almeria to Manchester. Paid for extra leg room at the front of plane - when boarding we were told plane had changed and so our seats were not available, however they would still give us extra leg room in a different row - when got on the plane these were not extra leg room at all. Emailed Monarch about this only to get an automated response saying our payment for the extra leg room would be returned. No real apology or nothing. The comments I had made in the email therefore totally ignored.

### "cabin crew really helpful"
Flew Monarch from Alicante to Gatwick on the ZB265 on the 29th May 2017 on board A321 (G-ZBAK). Seated in row 1 seats were very comfortable and leg room generous. Cabin crew really helpful and also very cheerful. Flight left on time and also arrived promptly despite a missed approach initially into LGW. Overall a great flight experience and far more superior product to some of the other UK based low cost and charter airlines. My only criticism and something I was not happy with was that Monarch do not appear to apply a 2 crew rule in the cockpit at all times.

### "pleasantly surprised by the legroom"
Flew Monarch Airlines from Manchester to Porto. Pleasantly surprised. Booked an extra legroom seat outbound and was pleasantly surprised by the legroom. Inbound however was a standard seat and was tight to say the least (5'10" tall). I would certainly opt for extra legroom on future bookings. Service although buy on board was courteous and efficient and the food quality was actually fine. It puts the budget airline British Airways to shame. Being able to pay cash was a bonus. Outbound was running around an hour late and I received an email from Monarch whilst in the airport to say rescheduled which was a nice touch. Inbound was just as efficient and arrival in Manchester was on time. Overall I would book again providing the flight schedules are suitable.

### "herded around like cattle"
Birmingham to Fuerteventura. Flight was delayed for nearly 4 hours, we were boarded onto an aircraft that had flown in with a known fault so we sat in our seats with technicians running around for 1.5 hours, we were then disembarked given a £5 voucher and sent back to departures. Another aircraft was flown in and we finally departed at about 18.00 hours - original departure time should have been 14.15, arrived at destination airport 22.00 getting to hotel at 23.00. I had spent nearly an hour on the phone at Birmingham ringing the transfer company and hotel with updates as departure times kept changing,. We paid for priority boarding, that didn't happen on boarding either planes (when I queried this one of the cabin crew I was told not to ask), we expected to arrive mid evening, relax have a nice meal and start our holiday, instead we arrived absolutely shattered and went straight to bed. There was a lack of information, we were herded around like cattle, we should never have been boarded onto an aircraft with a known fault.

### "lack of legroom between the seats"
❎ Unverified |  My wife and I flew to Majorca on 10/5/17. Everything was fine as far as the flight was concerned, on time, very courteous and professional cabin crew. My main gripe is the lack of legroom between the seats. I am six feet tall and weigh just over 19 stone. I could not fold the food and drinks tray fully down and had to put my coffee on my wife's tray. My knees were pressed up against the back of the seat in front. I didn't see why I should have to pay for extra leg room, I have flown several times with other airlines and have never had problems in that respect. On arrival at Palma there was no Rep to greet us and show which bus to get to our hotel. Eventually we got a Jet2 rep to show us where the Monarch desk was to find out the number of our bus. At no time did any correspondence from Monarch (or indeed Thomas Cook, our original booking agents, who placed us with Monarch) give any instructions about procedure upon arrival at the airport. I feel that this is an area that needs attention, I feel that Thomas Cook took our holiday booking, placed us with Monarch, and then washed their hands of us and took no further part in our holiday, the same applies to Monarch.

### "never use this airline again"
Faro to Gatwick. I regularly use Monarch Airline for short trips and family holidays.i have always been satisfied with the Customer Service and inflight staff. I have recommended Monarch to family and friends who tend to book through this airline. 2 weeks ago I travelled to (Portugal) Faro airport from London Gatwick. I was due to stay for a few month and book my return thereafter. However due to an immediate exceptional change in circumstances I had to book an earlier flight back o the UK. I didn't need to take my luggage with me just a small piece of hand luggage. I booked on line and accidentally clicked the 23k check in luggage. I rang Monarch to explain, however the customer services adviser was quite dismissive as well as abrupt she advised me Monarch can add extra baggage but if something has been done in error or there are exceptional circumstances they cannot refund or change. I emailed Monarch and received an email reply from customer services reiterating the information i had been given over the phone, 'sorry' for the staff member i spoke to and added it will be looked into. No further comments were made except I apologise for any inconvenience caused. I emailed again and explained that I was not satisfied with the response. I explained that I will be returning to Portugal in 2 weeks and would like to book with Monarch again as I always do and in addition to this I have 5 of my family members travelling a few weeks after who would also like to book with Monarch. I received a reply 5 days later advising me that Monarch is a non refundable airline this applies to all fare and extras you wish to add regardless of exceptional circumstances. There was no mention or the fact that they will lose the custom of 6 regular members of my family (including me) who have been loyal customers over a number of years to Monarch. Monarch can take your money additional baggage allowances etc after checking in but due to exceptional circumstances they cannot make a simple decision to keep loyal customers. They said I should have read the terms and conditions prior to booking however under such circumstances you don"t. I do think at times common sense must prevail - however if your making as much money as Monarch do why would the loss of 5 regular customers matter. I will never use this airline again.

### "flight was actually very pleasant"
I haven't flown with Monarch for a number of years as I don't tend to travel on package holidays, however, on a recent trip to Rome the airline offered a return ticket price which was substantially cheaper than any competetors which scheduled flight times which were perfect for a short city break (early morning outbound, late evening inbound). The booking process was painless. Their website is easy to navigate and displays fully what you are getting for your fare at every opportunity. After initial booking I opted to download the Monarch app to try and stick to my mantra of being a 21st century traveller (eTix, mobile boarding pass etc). I was slightly disappointed that the app encouraged you to check in early and then made it appear that you could not proceed with booking until you had purchased a seat as I feel that this could mislead many families, particularly those that aren't very tech savvy, however, I understand that this is how low cost airlines operate and therefore I'll put that issue to bed. On arrival at BHX I was disappointed at how the check in desks were organised and operated. My wife had 1x item of hold luggage that she had declared at online check in, however, we still had to wait in the mammoth 6am queue with those that had not yet checked in something that I feel could easily be rectified with a bag drop only desk or 2. Following check in we proceeded through security to airside departures. One thing I was quite surprised by was how early the airline called 'Last Call'. We were directed to the boarding area some 50 minutes before departure and then had to wait in said area or in our allocated seat. What added further insult was the delay we then experienced. With no direction from the cabin crew or flight deck we experienced a 20 minute doors closed delay. Alas, we eventually got on our way and despite everything else I have said in this review so far the flight was actually very pleasant. Leg room is at a premium - something I am not particularly bothered by as this is what you expect with low cost short haul. The seats were comfortable with sufficient recline, the pitch of the recline was such that it didn't chop the knees of the passenger behind which is commendable. Following departure the flight deck crew were informative and managed to recoup some of the time we lost on departure. The cabin crew were pleasant and friendly. They did 1x drinks/food service and 1x duty free service which is more than sufficient for 2 hours. The inflight menu was quite pricey, I only had a non premium gin and tonic, however this still came to 8€, expensive compared to land prices! The meal deal, however, offers good value for money and shouldn't be frowned at. Overall the journey was smooth with a perfectly executed landing. Although the A321 we flew on was ageing (c2007) you still had more comfort and opportunity for a nap than most other low cost airlines I have travelled with. Without the ground issues this would have been a good journey overall.

### "professional and very efficient"
Gatwick to Tenerife South. This was my 2nd Budget Airline Flight in the last 2 months, the other being EasyJet, of the 2 Monarch was the one I was dreading the most. The check in was quick and efficient,  a new plane or recently refurbished, more space than I imagined, both seat width and leg room. Cabin attendants professional and very efficient. Down sides -seat cushions a bit hard for a 4hrs+ flight, and on board food and drink very expensive. They float on the time efficiency but the plane could of departed a bit earlier as everyone was on board, but then got stuck in a long wait for take off, 30 mins. I will in future give Monarch a look in when booking a cheap flight. Let's hope they keep up the good work.

### "courteous and professional"
Gatwick to Tenerife. From booking to the flight attendants and private taxi transfer was faultless. The staff are courteous and professional. The plane was spotless and whilst we were a little delayed leaving Gatwick the staff kept us fully informed at every step. Even the checking in desks at both ends of the journey are customer friendly.

### "staff were helpful and professional"
Flew Monarch Airlines from Las Palmas to London Gatwick. Very good service received following an incident requiring our flight to be unavoidably delayed. Monach staff were helpful and professional. We were accommodated overnight in excellent hotels which was no small task with over 200 passengers. We would not hesitate to fly with Monarch again thanks.

### "this is the worst customer service"
Booked to fly Monarch Airlines from Tenerife to London. This is the worst customer service you can ever imagine. I tried to check in online 24 hours before because I wanted to sit next to my 4 year old daughter and there is no option to check in online if you have booked with anybody else. I had to wait 20 minutes on the phone to hear somebody try to flog me things I dont want. I eventually spoke to somebody who said they would only do it for 22 Euros. I asked if they would put my 4 year old alone in the cabin if they refused and they said yes!

### "smoothly and without incident"
Luton to Rome-Fiumicino. This is my first experience of flying so prepare for potential ignorance. We arrived extremely early to London Luton to ensure no delays in our flight to Rome. A departure gate was given about an hour before the flight was due to depart which was when we first encountered the staff for Monarch. We had chosen to travel carry on only and had checked in digitally. At present, Monarch does not provide the function to use an electronic boarding pass on your phone so we had to use printed boarding passes. The staff at the gate were pleasant enough, if a little distant. It was apparent they had strict time deadlines and so politeness was kept to a minimum. We spent about 20 minutes waiting in a stairwell for us to be able to board the aircraft; Luton doesn't have the facilities of the larger airports and so boarding was done via stairs fore and aft. The plane in question is an A321-100 which was fully booked. Though clean and tidy, it had the appearance inside of being a little bit "old" but then I have no real experience elsewhere. I am fully appreciative it's a budget airline as well. Boarding took an age as the flight was jampacked but we still managed to leave roughly on time. The cabin staff were all friendly enough. The captain gave us a thorough commentary of the flight which is a nice touch. After take off, the refreshments run was made. Prices are steep but I expect nothing less on an airline; sadly, no refreshment provided with booking due to the short flight. Still, food was presentable and reasonably tasty with both warm and cold options. Monarch did have a "shopping round" with some duty free goods available on the plane but unsurprisingly no one partook. We arrived in Rome very slightly ahead of schedule and disembarked quickly. In all, the staff remained courteous and professional throughout. No one took issue with my hold luggage which I was expecting and the flight was conducted smoothly and without incident.

### "friendly but professional crew"
Excellent flight on Monarch Airbus 321 from Manchester Terminal 2 to Tenerife South. Nice aircraft, comfortable seats in row 5 (purchased extra legroom seats). Friendly but professional crew both in the cockpit and the cabin. Left and arrived on time and decent food/snacks/drinks onboard although a little pricey. Return flight on 12th February equally good and arrived ten minutes early, a real bonus. Well done Monarch.

### "good value for money"
Gatwick to Alicante with Monarch Airlines. Very clean aircraft and comfortable. I will fly with Monarch any time. Fantastic staff and great food. Very good value for money. From Gatwick to Alicante and back, both very pleasant flights.

### "extra leg room was brilliant"
Flew Gatwick to Tenerife with Monarch. No negative reviews, don't usually use Monarch but will consider them for future flights. Good service, excellent cabin crew. Food was was good and the drinks trolley came around twice. Extra leg room was brilliant, I am 6ft 5ins tall and felt very comfortable in these seats.

### "we were allocated different seats"
Information if you are travelling with children we are a family of 7 (5 adults and 2 children). We always prebooked and paid for our seats to ensure we sit together. Our outward flight to Palma was fine we sat in the seats booked, not so lucky on the way home. We were allocated different seats, 3 in the booked seats 3 moved 3 rows back and to our horror one of the children had been seated across the aisle inbetween two strangers. I queried this at the check-in desk and was advised our seats had been changed by Monarch so we could not sit in the seats we had pre-booked and would need to contact them re the change. The most distressing thing about the re seating involved the lack of concern they had for children’s safety as they seated my grandson separate to other members of our family even though there are 5 adults he could have been with. With the cooperation of the other passengers we changed my grandsons seat so he was sat with his brother and a very distressed mother. I emailed them for an explanation as to why our seats were changed and a child separated from the family. Their first reply took 2 week and was a standard business reply with no explanationI then emailed back as I was not happy with the reply and again asked for an explanation. The second reply took 17 days and still they had no explanation as to why the seats were changed as it was not their policy to separate family’s. I will never again travel on Monarch with children as I don't consider them a responsible airline.

### "policy for delayed baggage totally inadequate"
Manchester to Lisbon. Delayed baggage for two days. Paid for suitcase to be put in the hold and it was not sent until 2 days later. Monarch's policy for delayed and lost baggage is totally inadequate. They will not even refund the cost for placing the baggage in the hold.

### "would like to thank all the crew"
We flew with Monarch Airlines for our holiday from Gatwick to Tenerife South, and on our return journey I was taken ill. The cabin crew were very good they came to help me straight away and called for any passenger that was a doctor to please come forward. My body was shaking and this frightened my grandchildren, so another crew member took them to the back of the plane so they could not see me. When we landed everybody was held back from getting off so a paramedic could come and see me. Whilst the paramedic was seeing to me, the Captain came back to see that I was ok. I would like to thank all the crew for how they handled the situation.

### "charge for a service then fail to deliver"
I paid for priority check in and priority boarding for me and my partner on our outbound flight from Birmingham on 26th June and our inbound flight on 3rd July. At Birmingham we ended up going through the normal check in as the priority check in was busier and in Palma the priority check in lane was full of normal check in passengers and if my partner hadn't complained to the check in staff we would have had to line up with those that hadn't paid. Even then we had to wait behind a large family that had commenced check in although they hadn't paid for priority. At boarding the staff member just allowed anyone through onto the plane even though he had used his tannoy to state that priority boarding passengers would be loaded first. Monarch offer and charge for a service then fail to deliver. It is one big scam.

### "crew first class"
Travelled today on a short flight into Gatwick form Verona. Crew first class, courteous and offered good inflight service. For a so called low cost carrier Monarch reigns supreme in all aspects of customer care. It is a pity they do not operate on some longer flights. Keep up the good work.

### "pleasant experience and would use again"
Preveza to Gatwick with Monarch. Boarded on time, staff in Preveza extremely helpful and pleasant. Seats towards front of cabin have greater leg room and were comfortable, aircraft clean. Staff a little distant, though polite and professional. Drinks and snacks offered for purchase, usual good selection from low cost airlines. All round a pleasant experience and would not hesitate to use again.

### "serious lack of customer service"
Flight ZB 3593, 20th June had been delayed arriving in Naples due to baggage conveyer / manning problems, arrived in Luton from Naples to find that the stairs were not available to unload the passengers? After 20 minutes managed to disembark to then find that the passport control was in a total mess/mayhem, the system to separate non e-passport holders and e-passport holders was a joke. We then found that the electronic system was only correctly operating 60% of the time, the staff were clearly blaming the passengers and were displaying a clear nonchalant attitude (the e-system in Naples worked perfectly). We then proceeded to get our cases and realised that there was no sign of our cases, in fact a previous flight from Malaga had yet to be completed after the passengers waiting for 90 minutes, following passengers twittering with Monarch there was a random comment over the tannoy saying that the delay was due to an operational issue? We then realised that a flight that arrived after our flight from Baku had been unloaded and their cases were coming off our conveyer belt, these as you can imagine were the F1 teams such as Williams Racing, our bags appeared after a total wait of over 1 hour 20 minutes. In summary do not use Monarch as they are unable to manage their airport service providers, they are now a poor easyJet/Ryanair airline, also avoid using Luton airport as this poorly managed and has a serious lack of customer service, the staff show a low morale and are unable to react to situations that require their attention.

### "wouldn't wish to fly them again"
4:00 am at London Gatwick South isn't my preferred time for checking-in to a scheduled flight to Dalaman. Sadly, a later flight with BA had been cancelled because of insufficient demand, so Monarch Airlines it had to be. In fact, check-in and security was quick and painless, and even the No. 1 lounge was just about okay. The onboard experience was average to irritating, because of  a crying child a few rows behind, the borderline moronic people behind us getting fueled up with champagne and beer at a ridiculous time of the day, and  Monarch's insistence on trying to persuade passengers to their rubbishy snacks and limited hot food options. Still, the plane landed more-or-less on time and our luggage eventually turned up on the carousel. Flying with Monarch wasn't as dispiriting as say Ryanair, but we certainly wouldn't wish to fly with them again.

### "awkward and unfriendly"
Very awkward and unfriendly check-in staff at Gatwick for flight to London Gatwick. I had no large bag to check in, only one piece of cabin baggage which they weighed and then rudely told me it was overweight which was strange because it hadn't been considered 'overweight' on the previous flight with Monarch from Tenerife. Meanwhile they were happily checking in people who had several pieces of hand baggage, well over the allowance, people who were obese and weighed at least 3 times my slender 9 stone.

### "a very relaxed experience"
My wife and I flew with Monarch Airlines from Gatwick to Las Palmas. Due to being a wheelchair user I managed to book extra legroom seats. The whole process from check in to leaving the aircraft went smoothly. What I really liked was that the staff listened to what I needed and went with it. The cabin crew were absolutely fantastic and could not have been more helpful. Everything was done with kindness and a genuine smile. I have taken many flights to various destinations around the world using different airlines and this team were amongst the very best. The seats were not too bad for width and legroom considering I am 6'3" tall and over 280kg. I used my own wheelchair gel cushion and back support so this may have made a positive difference. The aircraft was half empty so we ended up having a seat between us for our bits and bobs. It made for a very relaxed experience. We left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. I cannot say enough positive words about this flight and the cabin crew.

### "flights have been excellent"
Manchester to Preveza. I have flown with Monarch twice recently and both flights have been excellent. We chose seats with extra legroom in row 10 where there are just 2 seats together rather than 3 so ideal for a couple traveling together. It was worth the 15GBP each way for the seats. Both flights on time even arriving early and the first plane had been refurbished with really comfy modern seats. Great staff on board and on the ground, Monarch seem to be that bit better than other budget airlines and more professional.

### "went to Air France"
Birmingham to Nice with Monarch Airlines. Arrived at the airport with a second luggage to put in hold. Learnt at the check-in desk that it was impossible to buy a second baggage allowance and therefore that every kg represented by this luggage will be charged 10£ as well as 36£ penalty fees. Finally for a ticket bought 40£+20£ (first baggage allowance) they were asking me 256£ supplement for one additional hold bag. Obviously refused to take the flight and went to Air France and got a much cheaper rate. To make the thing worse, the employees at the desk were unprofessional and not sure about the baggage allowance policy. After 10mn of debate, I was sent to the manager on duty. In addition to be patronizing towards me, she was arrogant, made my experience even worst.

### "pilot reluctantly apologised"
Flew Monarch from Gatwick to Malaga. It was pouring with rain at 6.45am, we were queuing up outside. I asked why there was no tunnel and was told that the other plane used it. After entering the plane wet, I waited for the apology over the tannoy. It never came. I then asked an attendant when would we get the 'sorry. He had a word with his cabin manager and the pilot reluctantly apologised but you could here he despised saying it. As we left the plane not one of the attendants said goodbye to its passengers. The culture is different, middle England, sort of a bloated fat and happy kind of attitude. Its a shame they do not survey every passenger every time so they can grab the social media unhappy posters. I doubt they even take noe of what is written on here.

### "extra legroom seats 32 euros each"
Gatwick to Faro return. Having flown Monarch many times and not had a problem, we were surprised to be delayed firstly when boarding and then again whilst waiting for our slot. Not only that but upon arrival at Faro, an ambulance arrived to take a disabled person off the back. Instead of opening the front and letting us all go out that way, we had to sit yet again - why? Coming back from Faro we were shocked to be told that extra legroom seats were 32 euros each! We declined but were happy to find that our return flight was on a new plane with the slimmer seats, this means there is extra legroom anyway. I would be interested to know why they don't restock with sandwiches for the return leg? We had our own food, but there were a lot of unhappy golfers on board because there were no sandwiches to be had at all.

### "experience is stressful "
Alicante to London Gatwick. From start to finish the Monarch experience is a stressful one. For weeks before you actually fly, you'll be bombarded with 'countdown ' emails inviting you to upgrade your seat, purchase insurance, etc. Once on board, the pitch of seats on the more elderly ex-GB Airways 321s is so ridiculous that the tray table cannot fully extend and you can't even reach down to pick up anything you might drop on the floor. Monarch do have seats with more generous legroom but these are sold off at £20 a pop once you're on the aircraft, so far that reason, even if your flight isn't entirely full, you're forbidden from changing seat. There is a constant push to shift alcohol, even on early morning flights, which results in a pretty rowdy cabin by landing- airlines which adopt this practice of encouraging drinking at altitude only have themselves to blame for cabin trouble, diversions, arrests, etc- but it makes for a pretty unpleasant atmosphere for other passengers. Monarch continued to send me emails throughout my holiday and after arriving back home but I've made up my mind guys; it'll be the first and last time I use Monarch unless you stop treating your flights like (extremely cramped) flying bars.

### "very aware of weight allowances"
I travel each month from my home in Spain regularly using Monarch, and I am au fait with Internet bookings. On this occasion I found myself forced to stay in England for an extended period, due to the illness of my elderly parents, and made an unusually large amount of purchases, so whilst booking I booked an extra case to accommodate them and allow me a worry-free passage through the airport. As a regular traveller, I am generally knowledgeable about some of the pitfalls of airline rules and regulations. By booking an extra bag, I believed I had plenty of space and even included my hand luggage into the 2 suitcases. Whilst packing for my flight on Saturday evening, I tried to call Monarch customer service number to clarify the exact packing amount, (I admit there was some doubt in my mind). However, the office was closed. I find it extraordinary, as it is a 7 day a week industry. I should have been able to ask that question, and have got a simple answer at 8pm on an evening prior to departure. I was very relieved when I printed my Boarding Pass to see clearly printed 2/20kg bags, which I took to mean 2 x 20kg bags. I did not expect it to be 1 x 20kg bag and 1 x empty bag (which of course has weight) or 2 x 10kg bags. I regard myself to be of fairly average intelligence and, in the absence of clarification, took the Boarding Pass to indicate I had successfully booked 2 x 20kg bags. After some research I believe this may be a perceived misconception by other travellers and although the ground-crew were very well versed in explaining that some people prefer 2 lighter weight bags, it would seem that this is a pit fallen into by other customers. I have just paid a £200 excess baggage charge for 20kg of luggage and just £165 for me (via my internet booking) and 20kg of luggage (plus of course an empty bag). I realise now that the weight of that bag was not allowed for! I contacted customer services and sent copies to the CEO and have been offered no reasonable response. Therefore I would warn all travellers - Be very aware of weight allowances and invest in your own weighing machine - not expensive but very useful! The staff all did their best, but "rules are rules". Needless to say, Monarch have lost a customer.

### "leg room was appalling"
The leg room on this Monarch Airlines flight from Birmingham to Malaga was appalling. I am only 156cm tall and my knees were touching the seat in front. The passenger in front of me had to sit at an angle and push his seat back which gave me no room at all with absolutely no chance of using my tray! Luckily for my husband and I the seat by the window was free, so we used the tray in the middle because he couldn't use his tray either. Why should we have to pay extra for more leg room. I'm glad it was only a flight to Spain.

### "time to fit new seats"
Manchester to Tenerife return. On the outward flight the crew had to deal with a passenger falling ill after we had pushed back and were about to take off. The crew appeared to deal with this efficiently with good communication on what was happening. Eventually the passenger had to be taken off the plane and we continued the journey. The return journey was problem free. On both legs  the cabin crew were excellent and all aspects of the flights were good apart from seats. When we have flown Monarch in the past we have booked extra legroom seats but on this occasion we were unable to do so because all those seats were taken when we made the booking. We were very surprised at how little legroom we had in the normal seats. To make matters worse the seat cushions were very worn out, we might as well have been sitting on the springs. So come on Monarch, time to fit new seats. We will be looking at the alternatives next time we fly.

### "you pay for what you get"
Manchester to Fuertaventura with Monarch Airlines. We opted to buy extra legroom seats and were pleased that we did. On the outbound leg we were about 40 minutes late taking off which they blamed on need to de-ice the plane but in truth we did not start boarding until 10 minutes after departure time and this was slowed by a demand for some passengers to put their hand luggage in the hold. Due I think to items for the return flight being stored in the overhead lockers by the staff. Flight was good and arrived only just behind schedule. The return flight was smooth and arrived ahead of time. Monarch is very like a lot of other low cost airlines and you pay for what you get. A seat on the plane, anything else is extra and at £4 for a small can of lager, £1.80 for a can of pepsi max and £4.50 for a bacon panini plus hold luggage charges and so on can work out very expensive. The panini by the way was very hot, very dried out and tasteless. Staff were pleasant and professional throughout. A good airline compared to some low cost options.

### "I was quite impressed"
Tenerife South to Birmingham, and had not flown with Monarch Airlines for some time, and I was quite impressed with the flight and the service. The flight was slightly delayed departing (technical problems), but expectations managed well by good communication on revised times and explanation from captain. Online check-in a few days before the flight and had baggage only, so we went straight to departures. TFS airport is a bit of a rip-off for refreshments (and certainly don't think of purchasing anything in the airport tax-free shops as they are far too expensive). We had paid for extra legroom seats at the front of the cabin, and there were just the two of us in our half of the row, so we were able to spread ourselves out with a free seat between us - rather like the old British Airways Club Europe. Well worth paying the extra for these seats and very pleased that Monarch continue to offer them. Nice friendly cabin crew, professional and welcoming. Good selection of refreshments, at usual airline prices. Comfortable, slimline seats. Good price paid for trip too. Will fly again.

### "efficient, polite and friendly"
Rome to Luton return with Monarch Airlines. Outward and inward flights on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Despite a fairly full aircraft the cabin crew were efficient, polite and friendly. I ordered extra leg room seats and an inflight meal, which was of a good quality. I was most impressed by the way one stewardess managed a particularly difficult passenger who was quite rude and aggressive, and that efforts were made to juggle seating to allow a last minute couple to sit together. Monarch Airlines is every bit as good as it's larger contemporaries, just a bit friendlier!

### "absolutely no communication"
Due to high winds in Manchester the plane diverted to East Midlands. We were to be bussed to Manchester. That seems to be as much as Monarch were going to be responsible for. No announcements were made once we got into the very depressing East Midlands airport. We stood around outside in dreadful weather waiting for buses. Absolutely no communication. OK the weather, no one to blame. But absolutely no excuse for the abysmal lack of communication. First flight with Monarch, don't anticipate a second. East Midlands airport was inundated with diverted planes because of the weather. They had an unenviable job.

### "give them the highest praise"
Sharm El Sheikh to Birmingham. Myself and my partner were caught up in the security situation in Egypt following the bombing of the Russian Aircraft. Monarch had my mobile number but, unfortunately my mobile decided that it would stop working in Egypt. My daughter (in the UK) had to contact them and give them an alternative number so that they could contact me regarding our flight home. I received a call on Saturday 14th November informing me that our flight home would be leaving the following day and that it would be to Birmingham and not Manchester. We were met at Sharm airport by a number of, polite and helpful Monarch Airways staff and were airborne almost on time. The Captain and  crew were marvellous and the complimentary meal we were given on board was greatly appreciated. On arrival at Birmingham we were met, once again by a number of very understanding Monarch Airways staff who surprised us all by giving us a free bag containing a loaf, milk and a packet of biscuits. Whoever thought of this little gift should be complimented as, at almost midnight on a Sunday night, this was a very welcome gift. I can only give them the highest praise for the way that they looked after us.

### "not impressed at all"
Gatwick to Sharm el Sheikh with Monarch Airlines. Cabin crew worked hard, but dirty plane - dirty all round the seat and chewing gum in the seat pockets. When I told the cabin crew member she offered me baby wipes - what about moving me to a clean seat, or wasn't there a clean seat available? Not impressed at all. I paid more for this ticket than I did in May to travel to Dubai with Emirates who were outstanding even in economy.

### "staff pleasant and hard working"
Return flights from Birmingham to Dalaman. Aircraft clean, staff pleasant and hard working, service good, and as has been said extra legroom seats well worth it. Return flight equally as good, I only wish the baggage service at Birmingham was as efficient. Well done Monarch Airlines.

### "crew were pleasant and apologetic"
Fly Monarch Airlines frequently as not basic and extra leg room seats very comfortable. Delayed 1hr due to problem with aircraft - fortunately replacement aircraft available at Gatwick so ready to go pretty quickly. Ground staff not very informative or organised. Flight crew visible and spoke to passengers, a nice touch explaining and apologising for delay. The cabin crew were pleasant and apologetic, service efficient with a smile. An enjoyable flight.

### "extra leg room worth the money"
Gatwick to Alicante return. Both flights almost full and  on time. We booked extra leg room seats, well worth the money. Crew very good. Did not purchase any refreshments.

### "service very good"
I found the Monarch Airlines service very good. The crew were very attentive and eager to assist. The aircraft was clean. The check in was quick and we landed early on the outward journey, coming back the weather was very windy and we were advised that we may have to divert, but the captain made a text book landing and we were 5 mins early. I would certainly travel with Monarch Airlines again.

### "staff not helpful at all"
Just got home after a nightmare flight on a Monarch Airlines flight. We paid for our seats extra when booking our holiday and on both journeys from Luton to Palma de Mallorca and return they gave us the most dreadful seats looking onto the wing of the plane with no view whatsoever. On our return journey the seats were the same except it was worse seeing as directly behind me a small boy aged around 5 or 6 years sat with his family, and all the through the journey he was kicking my seat. I didn't say anything about it but then he started having a tantrum with continuous screaming and screaming the whole journey. The staff on board did nothing to try to control the situation and ignored my pleas for paracetamol after I told them I had a bad headache with the noise. The staff didn't offer my husband and I an alternative seat although as I found out nearer to my destination that there were other seats available further back as just before landing I was forced to ask for another seat. The boy screamed and screamed the whole trip until we were near landing with no one from the staff trying to help the situation. The staff were not helpful at all or pleasant.

### "Plane clean and tidy"
Manchester to Sharm el Sheikh return with Monarch Airlines. Plane clean and tidy on both routes, plenty of legroom at front in extra legroom part, which is where and why we fly with Monarch. Snacks range could do with expanding and MPLAYER seems absent on every plane we go on? Usual comment about Egypt being classed as short haul, therefore no entertainment but doubt it will change. But as a flight to a destination we like Monarch as they do what they say on the tin.

### "our extra legroom seats unavailable"
Although paying for extra legroom seats on this flight, my wife and I were only informed on checking-in, that the Monarch Airlines flight had been sub-contracted out to Titan Airways (a charter company) and being an older type of aircraft, our extra legroom seats were unavailable. The staff at Monarch Airlines desk had no idea why the aircraft had been changed and were extremely unhelpful (just producing a pre-printed letter by way of explanation). The seats we were allocated on the replacement aircraft were very cramped and the ensuing flight was the most uncomfortable we had ever experienced. Instead of automatically refunding the additional cost of the extra legroom seats, we had to ask the Titan Airways cabin staff for a claim form (for Monarch Airlines) which they did after two requests. As this was the first day of our honeymoon, I requested compensation for the disappointment and discomfort caused by Monarch's decision to substitute the aircraft (and amend our seat allocations) without any prior notice. Their response was negative and needless to say we will not be travelling with Monarch Airlines again.

### "food service was very disappointing"
Hardly any legroom for a 4 hour Monarch Airlines flight and I'm only a medium build 5'8" chap. No tv or audio and plane seemed old and not that cared for. Food service was very disappointing - staff were nice but airline delivery very poor. I will definitely not be flying with them again. Was treated worse than cattle with little information given for over a 5 hour delay followed by a cramped 4 hour flight then waited 1.5 hours until they started to unload the baggage from the plane. There was no rep from Monarch or their ground services agent available and no info given as to the progress of baggage unloading. This airline needs to change or go under as cost cutting is beyond Ryanair standards.

### "very good service and efficient"
Monarch Airlines from Alicante to Gatwick, with very good service and efficient. Slight delay on departure but arrival on time. There was turbulence and lurching all over the place on our descent into Gatwick, which proved to be very uncomfortable for most passengers. The landing was quite smooth with a bit of a 'bump' which was fine, but the speed of the aircraft was fast and there was a sudden jolt as the cockpit crew rapidly applied the brakes to slow us down; it was quite abrupt and we has to grab the seat in front. There was no explanation or apology from the Captain over the rough descent and landing, which was a shame as it spoilt the overall flight.

### very happy with this service"
I was expecting a usual routine flight with Monarch Airlines from Gatwick to Alicante, and not expecting any food unless I paid for it separately. Proved quite wrong and was surprised to discover that we were one of two Monarch flights leaving for Alicante this particular morning ; I wasn't expecting a full breakfast free of charge. Surprised and very happy with this service - thank you Monarch!

### "choose a different airline next time"
Flew with Monarch Airlines for the first time from Manchester to Orlando Sanford, and I would choose a different airline next time. The main meal was very small, and the breakfast was a muffin and a yogurt. The crew were friendly but drinks were expensive. The aircraft seemed old as the windows were scratched and the cabin was dirty.

### "clean, spacious, and very good legroom"
A great flight with Monarch Airlines from Birmingham to Alicante. Cabin crew were polite and helpful. The catering was all very satisfactory. The aircraft was very clean, spacious, and very good legroom.

### "didn't get the seats I had pre-booked"
Booked through Thomas Cook as part of a package holiday. Pre-booked extra leg room exit seat 26A (due to being 6'6") with family seated behind in 27ABC for both legs. At check-in advised that 11 yr old daughter had been seated elsewhere as the 3 rows behind an exit row were also classed as exit rows and only for over 14's. Much confusion ensued and eventually I got a bulkhead seat but separate from the rest of the family. Emailed ahead for return leg to avoid similar but didn't get the seats I had pre-booked. Email to Monarch Airlines on return but no reply until chased and still no satisfactory explanation. Crew outbound struggled to raise a smile and service was rushed. Pre-booked meals awful, especially the kids pasta meal. Crew on return leg bit better. Seats really hard and uncomfortable. Won't fly Monarch Airlines again if I can avoid it.

### "good things to say about Monarch Airlines"
Nothing but good things to say about Monarch Airlines and their new seating. Used to always fly Club Europe with British Airways to Paphos at least 3 times a year, but their standards have slipped considerably, so resent paying the significant premium over economy/budget airlines. Admittedly I always pay the extra for the extra legroom seats up the front but the pitch is greater than British Airways European business class and the seats significantly more comfortable despite being roughly 5 times cheaper! Not always guaranteed a middle seat free but so far have been lucky and food refreshments not included however I never eat airline food anyway. Disclaimer: my father in his own words is a fatty and he said after 3 hours or so the seat did feel a bit hard so maybe not so great for serial pie eaters.

### "seem to have made drastic cutbacks"
Traveled with my family of six on Monarch Airlines, Gatwick to Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Went through check in and passport control in South terminal, only to be put on a bus and taken to North terminal to board the plane. Was very disappointed that a 5 hour flight to Egypt had no TV screens and no audio facility in the arm rest. If you happen to have your own entertainment that needed wi-fi you paid for it (not available on our outward journey). The food and drink selection was very limited. Monarch Airlines seem to have made some drastic cut backs. I will think twice before travelling with Monarch again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Booking through a comparison website resulted in a small price hike. I still don't understand why Monarch Airlines charge to check online as it helps the airline to stream the process at the airport. The airplane with new slimline seats were comfortable and cabin crew were helpful. Arrival and departure on time but morning departure at Birmingham was chaotic.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I booked flights for my family online in early March 2015. I specifically selected and paid for 5 extra legroom seats. Upon getting onto the plane it became apparent that it did not have any extra legroom seats. I was then told that the original plane had been changed in March to the one we were now on. This was four months before we were due to fly and at no stage did Monarch inform me of this change to my scheduled flight which would have enabled me to seek alternative transport. I complained to Monarch by email whilst on holiday as I was concerned about the return flight. I got no response. Since arriving back in the UK I have again contacted them and been told my complaint is in a queue and will be dealt with in due course. Still no response to date.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Manchester (MAN) - Palma (PMI). Efficient check in service at Manchester. The flight was on time and upon arrival at the aircraft the crew were very welcoming. We departed 25 minutes late, however this was not due to Monarch, it was due to the large amount of flights at Manchester that morning. Lots of the variety for snacks and drinks, however maybe a little overpriced. I purchased a meal deal (£7.50), this was very tasty. Not much legroom and little uncomfortable. I have to admit I prefer the old Monarch interior than the new one though. Landed on time and good updates from the cockpit. Palma (PMI) - Manchester (MAN) Again, efficient check in service at Palma with the Iberia ground staff. Again I had the meal deal. It was the old Monarch interior: the seats were more comfortable, more legroom and just generally nicer and brighter cabin! Cabin crew were fantastic and really enjoyed the flight. I would fly with Monarch again, and it was great value for money.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
A long time since I have traveled with Monarch and I have to say very impressed. Nice roomy, clean modern aircraft, friendly and attentive crew on both journeys, and on time departures. Aircraft back from Malaga had the new slimline seats, again very impressed and you didn't feel cramped. They have taken the ridiculous and pointless seat reclining buttons out as with the ergonomic design of the new seat it makes you feel reclined anyway. Only gripe is boarding process a bit long winded, special assistance first, then frequent flyers and priority boarding, then adults with children under 5 then finally a free for all to the gate. When are airlines going to start using both front and rear doors even if they are using airbridges? I have seen it done at Faro airport and it works really well and stops the long winded fracas of everybody getting on one entrance and causing chaos in the cabin.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I booked my holiday last year and had the option of 2 flight times, 7am or 2.30pm, I wanted to go at 7am so chose this flight which bumped up the price quite considerably, a few months later Monarch cancelled this flight and put us on the 2.30pm flight, all they would refund me was £20 per person, a mere fraction of the difference paid to have the earlier flight. The week before flying, I had no confirmation of the priority check in I had booked online, it took several phone calls up until the day I was due to fly to sort this out. The flight was a bit late boarding but nothing major, I had pre-booked inflight meals, 2 adult and 2 child meals, they had us down for 4 adult meals and had no extra child meals to offer us, my children are fussy and the creamy chicken adult meal was no good to them, they were upset as they were excited to get their pasta and meatballs, the attitude of the cabin crew was not great, they eventually found a pasta dish but the children had to half it and they got about 6 pasta twists each, I ended up having to buy them additional food on board. The seats were too thin and uncomfortable after a couple of hours. The flight home was fantastic, couldn't have been a nicer experience, fantastic cabin crew, arrived back early.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flight out was on time, return slightly delayed due to aborted landing on a windy day in Funchal. At least Monarch got the plane on the ground, on the same day EasyJet and SAS failed and returned to their home bases. Cabin crew out and in bound very good. Seats were fine for 3.5 hour flight, might be slightly less so on a longer flight, as Monarch have ceased long haul not a problem. However we did pay for extra legroom. Good flight deck info both ways. One slight niggle, ordered meal online both ways (very tasty for an aircraft meal). Sitting in Row 10 finished the meal before the drinks trolley arrived. Maybe you could order drinks online too and get served at same time. As an airline would rate them higher than other UK located budget airlines.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
On time, lovely flight and crew very friendly on flight to Alicante on 20th June. Well done Monarch on your excellent service which started at check in through to our arrival in Spain. We were part of a group of 17 and they made the whole journey a breeze.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We checked in at Alicante on the 30th June to be told our flight (plane) had changed due to unforseen circumstances, and would be given complimantry food and hot drinks. Whilst we found this not to be a problem (at the time, when we got on the plane it was a different matter, the space between each seat was tiny and we were put in seats 33 with my disabled sister, special needs daughter and elderly father. Trying to eat our food was a nightmare. I then asked for cold drinks (which I was more than happy to pay for) but was told there were no cold drinks available and was offered lukewarm water.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Regular users of Monarch. Outbound, good service by cabin crew and kept well informed by flight deck. Old Seats'. comfortable. Inbound very much the same, but the 'New Seats', not at all comfy. yes extra leg room, but actual comfort more important. As usual booed in flight meals both ways, and this summers meals are first class. Excellent Chicken dish on outbound, and really superb braised Beef dish on inbound, both meals with cheese and biscuits and dessert and hot drink. Excellent value for money.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Surly check in staff who turned slow service in to an art form, ripped off to the tune of 50 euros for 0.9kg over weight cabin bag (not offered the opportunity to remove some fruit etc), late boarding with no information from said surly ground staff, cabin crew who seemed to think they were doing us poor hapless passengers a favour by deigning to serve us. I'll spend the extra hundred quid next time and go with a proper airline.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Travelled from Manchester to Faro on the 30th June and returned on 5th July. Check in went smoothly-clerk was pleasant and efficient. Slight delay on the outbound due to a nervous passenger being offloaded. Once under way the cabin crew offered a high standard of service. Flight crew kept us informed and kept passengers up to date. Did not buy any food etc so can't comment on this section. No inflight entertainment but not a problem for 2.5 hour flight. Seats were the older type so were comfortable. Return flight left Faro late due to amount of flights but we landed 20 mins late. Cabin crew very nice. Short wait for luggage on return at Manchester.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I booked a flight to Skiathos with Monarch Airlines. It was not until my booking was confirmed (and therefore could not be cancelled) that it became apparent this was not a monarch aircraft, but a Lithuanian carrier called SMALL PLANET. Not content with the misleading information, the flight time (originally 0630 from Gatwick was
changed firstly to a flight 5 hours later and then changed again less than 24 hors before the flight by a further 3 hours! The moral is to exercise caution and try to book a flight with a professional airline for the scheduled take off time.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Travelled in May to Tenerife we were a group of 6 adults 2 toddlers and an infant. We upgraded to extra leg room and chose seats all close to each other. Monarch changed the aircraft a week or so before the trip and notified us that our seats had changed. We were still together so all fine. Before travelling I phoned Monarch and enquired about child car seats and if ok to use on board - I have a very active 2 year old who doesn't sit still for 5 minutes! At first the lady told me that my car seat wouldn't be allowed on because the only car seats that are allowed on monarch flights are very old styles. (She hadn't asked which seat I had) I told her that I wasn't sure this was correct so she checked online. The website states that car seats are allowed for all children under 3 years old. She then put a note on the computer to say we were bringing a car seat and which seat this would go in on the plane. Arriving at check in we were greeted by a lady who told us that car seats are not allowed to be used on Monarch flights. She phoned someone and then told us that actually they are allowed but because our aircraft had been changed again we would not be able to use it as we were now sitting on the left of the plane and car seats must go on the right. aWe said we would take it down to the gate and let them decide. Once down there a lovely lady checked for us and told us it was fine but the seat would have to go next to the window. Thank goodness we took the seat toddler slept all the way there and all the way home. Monarch staff in Tenerife much happier and helpful than the staff in England. Not even a smile from the no car seats lady. Monarch please inform all of your staff on the car seat rules when travelling (especially with children) it really is a pain when given wrong information which delays checking in/ boarding. Car seats are much safer for young children to travel in and must also make the attendants job easier as no toddlers wandering down the aisles getting in the way.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
18th April Manchester to Verona and returned 25th April. Flight ZB1316 and ZB1317. Can't understand the bad reviews flew out of Manchester on time and landed early in Italy. Pleasant crew ground staff great booked extra leg room seats and being 6ft 3inches tall and not a small fella in size I was very surprised that the additional space was fantastic. No need to ask for a extension belt as the seat belts were more than big enough. New style seats are fine for short flights and very comfy indeed. Did not order food just a wee cup of tea to pass the time. Flight back left early and landed early all in all no complaints whatsoever.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Overall very happy with the level of service efficiency and pricing. Modern plane was clean. Seats were comfortable for a 2-3 hours flight. Meal service was at the expected level for a budget operator. Flights operated on time and on board staff dealt with any issues promptly courteously and efficiently. The main negative issue was the "Luton Airport" experience. Won't comment on the rip off prices as Monarch have no control but check in was a very poor experience - only one desk open for those checked in online - (this compared to four desks at Faro for the return). Not what you want at 5.30 in the morning.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
21st March O/B - 28th March I/B - BHX to SSH. Both flights were great paid £15 each for extra leg room both ways and what a difference for a 5 hour flight it makes. Both Aircraft were clean and the crew friendly yet professional. Flight deck informative on both sectors and departed on time and arrived early both ways. Only gripe was the check-in at Sharm it was slow and chaotic. But other than that two great flights Monarch have my business again for the future they are way ahead than Thomas Cook and Thomson.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew from AGP to MAN no problem at all left early arriving 25 min ahead of schedule. Flight deck very informative during flight cabin crew very professional. Overall better experience than the flight out with Ryanair in what felt like a shoebox even thought booked extra legroom seat. Would always use Monarch.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
This was the first and last time we will ever fly with Monarch. We have just arrived back from Hurgada - 'Gatwick'. The outbound flight on 13 March was fine only a few issues namely the severe lack of entertainment on board for a five hour flight and the ever changing price of an extra leg room seat which went from £30 online to £ £7 in the airport then back up to £15 on board. Our return flight was where the major issues started. Firstly the flight which took 5 hours on the way there was now going to take nearly 7 hours to return. We then sat on the tarmac for around 45 mins before finally taking off. After all of the waiting we then were told rather abruptly that the runway was closed at Gatwick and therefore we had to fly to Luton! We found it hilarious that all other flights managed to land at Gatwick with the 'runway closed' and also that Luton is Monarchs head quarters. We believe they had absolutely no intention of ever landing at Gatwick. Monarch staff were not present once we arrived as I imagine they simply couldn't be bothered to help us in any way. The handing agents Menzies were to organise the coaches. We were made to queue at a check in desk and told two coaches were ordered but that we would be taken to Gatwick on a first come first served basis! Bearing in mind there were 300 people on our flight. At no time were we given any vouchers or even a cup of water and we couldn't leave the queue as this may mean we would miss out on a place on the coach. When the coaches did arrive we had been waiting for over an hour and then had to tolerate the hour and a half coach trip to Gatwick. We were due to arrive at Gatwick at 9pm on Friday we actually arrived at 2am on Saturday. We have never experienced such a thing and we travel up to 7 times a year. We will stick to Norwegian Air and other reputable companies in the future.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Just last week flew on Monarch from Gatwick to Sharm. Second time in two years flown with Monarch and generally impressed with standard. On return trip I would say the crew were a little too social sharing conversation with colleagues a bit too openly and snacking drinking during services before flight etc. On the whole would fly again unless a legacy carrier were to open up a route. Would guarantee my custom if they were to offer a wider seat or separate cabin for a premium.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I have just returned from Alicante airport with Monarch. I was a saga passenger in my sixties and needed a wheelchair. Normally we are allowed on first when there is more space and time to get seated with help. I was shocked last night when we had to wait till the end and then face no baggage space and a delay being seated. It was very difficult and painful as I had to wait in a queue on the plane. I will have to consider not booking with Monarch if this should happen again. I hope this was a one off. We had no problem flying out from Manchester. I think the lax attitude of some of the staff was the problem.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
23 Jan and returned the evening of 30 Jan from BHX to Hurghada. Excellent flight and crew from Birmingham to Hurghada. Faultless and professional staff both ways especially on return journey when I suffered a nose bleed half way through the flight. All staff were fantastic above and beyond the call of duty in making me comfortable.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
LGW-INN return for ski holiday charter. Both directions had an A321 with older clean seats. Given exits without asking on the way out and standard seats on the return. It would have been nice to be able to check-in online but on charters this isn't possible apparently. Queues at both airports no more than 15 minutes. I noticed the cabin crew taking time with all customers and being friendly and professional. In my opinion the on-board menu is rather dull and I can't figure out why airlines can't sell stuff of the quality of high street coffee shops either heated or fresh? Both flights were on time and the return flight was in fact early to leave and arrive. Monarch is distinct because of it's high quality cabin staff and characterful identity. No problems experienced but nothing amazing about it all either. Would use again with no problem.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew ZB286 London Gatwick to Tenerife on 2nd February 2015. Flight on time. Excellent unobtrusive service from cabin crew. The best thing about Monarch now is the new slimline seating. They are comfortable enough for a 4 hour flight and would be OK for longer flights. The fixed angle of seat back is good (a compromise between fully upright and reclined) so there are no hassles with the passenger in front depriving you of your legroom. I am 6ft 3ins and there were a full 2 inches spare in front of my knees so I could sit comfortably and there is space for your tablet in the seat back in front. This is such an improvement on other budget airlines.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flight from Luton to Alicante last July. 9 hour delay minimal information. No staff on the ground. Arrived in the dark to collect my rental car. Return flight delayed although only 2/3 hours so felt lucky! No stairs to disembark at other end so had to wait half an hour for them to arrive then luggage didn't arrive for a further hour. Would never use them again.

Flew to Sharm and back this January with Monarch on 9 month old G-ZBAM. Aircraft immaculate crew professional and friendly. Informative announcements from cabin and cockpit no endless sales announcements. Arrived early on both flights. Aircraft had cloth seats and not the new slimline ones - leg room was perfectly fine - only criticism was thin seat backs so you could even feel the person behind you removing a magazine for example. Sixth journey with Monarch in the last 3 years consistently good.

I travelled from Birmingham to Alicante on 10 January returning on 17 January. I was very satisfied with the service received the cabin crew were friendly and the flight crew kept us informed of our progress. The seating was surprisingly comfortable for a budget airline and leg room seemed ample even without an extra legroom seat - I am 6 foot 1 inch tall so can be an issue!

ZB238/239 3rd-10th January. I have flown Monarch 4x times this year and have to write as they have improved immensely in the past 12 months. The check-in facility at Gatwick is now excellent. The standard of the refurbished cabins with the new slim back seating is so much better than any comparable airline - there is a real sense of space and no need to pay for extra legroom (I am 6ft+). The food/snack choice is more than acceptable and for the first time in a long time their crew seem to be genuinely trained in customer service. What's more - no delays this year! I hope these new changes are here to stay.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Travelled last night from Sharm El Sheikh to Birmingham. ZB0473. It was a total fiasco. Diverted to Venice for 30 min refuelling 'hop' only to discover crew out of hours. No replacement available and when it was the flight would not land at Birmingham but Luton. The result was a 7 hour delay overnight. Disgraceful service and 'suck it up people these things happen' attitude by Monarch pilots who couldn't tell a straight story between them. Have loved Monarch in the past but given them the benefit of the doubt now too many times. This airline doesn't deserve the loyalty of customers because it doesn't see them as people rather as 'bums on seats' and takes every opportunity to avoid responsibility. Would not recommend.

Manchester to Arrecife on 3rd January. Left pretty much on time. Clean tidy cabin and sufficient legroom for me (5ft 9). Pilot announcements were very informative and the crew were attentive and professional. Good selection of drinks/snacks. Flew return leg to Liverpool on 8th January with Easyjet. Monarch out-stripped them in every regard - particularly regarding the cabin crew - Easyjet need some lessons from Monarch going off this experience. Hadn't flown Monarch for some years but will certainly do so in the future.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Do Monarch not read their reviews? I note several where the lack of information is the complaint. Ours was not too bad but we were sat on the plane for 45 mins after our take off time with no information. Eventually one of the cabin staff showed herself so I asked why we hadn't left yet and was told it was due to air traffic control and our route was congested. Fine! Why did no-one bother to tell us? I suggested this to the stewardess who said "I will pass it up. Apart from that both flights were fine and the holiday/hotel through Monarch was excellent.

I have just returned from Sharm el Sheik. The seats are terrible you can feel peoples knees in your back constantly because seats are so thin we had 3 children with us and had nothing but complaints from people in front because are kids were accidentally touching the seat in front it was a nightmare. also the hot snacks were awful I will never travel with Monarch again because of the new seats.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Birmingham to Sharm El Sheikh on an A321. The plane was immaculately new the staff were lovely and professional but the leg room is so bad. There are other budget airlines out there with much better leg room. All in all a quick 4 hour 50 minute trip down and an okay 5 hours 40 minutes on the way back but I am nearly 6 foot and it is quite trying on a near 6 hour flight with no entertainment and a 3 x 3 layout on a rather long medium haul flight. I like Monarch for the price and flexible flight times and I know they have suffered recently with the economy and cut backs it is a huge shame that Sharm El Sheikh Hurghada and Banjul is not served by bigger planes. I loved the Airbus A300 when they had it 3x4x3 configuration in the 90's. I would fly Monarch again but preferably Canaries or Cyprus would be my maximum range. Monarch are now your budget average low cost airline now and there are other competitive airlines out there.

Flew to Hurghada from Gatwick 02/12/2014 on ZB770. Return flight ZB771 30/12/2014. Check in at Gatwick took less than 5 minutes. We were granted our extra 5 kilos of hold baggage on production of our dive licences with out any problems. We departed on time had a superb Flight Crew and First Class Cabin Crew who were superb from take off to landing. Extra length seat pitch well worth fee. Return flight ditto only query in my flying days pax were fed the meal related to time zone of destination. We had breakfast at Gatwick hotel at 0500 a second breakfast in airport lounge (only meal available) and then to our amazement rotate wheels up then the most disgusting inflight breakfast we have seen. Meal on return awful! I felt so sorry for the Cabin Crew who had to serve in our opinion food not fit for purpose. Returning to review fantastic flight out/return.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew Alicante-Luton. Check in a breeze at Alicante and boarding was very quick. We took off 10 minutes early from Alicante which was great. Flight itself was full on an A321 and service was good as always. Cabin crew very friendly and captain kept us informed at all times. Great flight looking forward to the return.

ZB684 14th Dec from Manchester. ZB685 21st from SSH. Flew with Monarch this past week and got to say they were fantastic. Travelling with two under 5's isn't easy and it was our first time. On this particular flight you had to purchase meals from a trolley and provide your own inflight entertainment (iPad comes in handy). Hospitality and service was excellent. Would recommend.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Returned home from Innsbruck yesterday on a Ski flight that was delayed by 3.5 hours due to bad weather. Whilst waiting for our flight we spent the morning watching Thomas Cook easyJet and lots of other airlines coping with the conditions. Why not Monarch? We were given food vouchers but by the time they were handed out there was no food left in the cafes. We all queued whilst staff tried to cope making extra rolls only to grab the food and dash for the flight. The pilot told us the flight would be 1hr 40 mins. We finally landed after 2hours 10 minutes after spending at least 30 minutes circling Gatwick pity there was no communication from any of the crew. How difficult is it to keep the fare paying passengers informed. If only you had a choice of airline with package holidays.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Excellent airline travelled a number of times with them and never had any problems. Latest flight ZB7504 on 28/11/14 return ZB7505 on 12/12/14 34 mins early at TFS and 25 mins early on return to LBA. Great cabin staff and flight crew. Awaiting to book our next flight with Monarch.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Round trip to Malaga. We have always liked the staff - generally more 'mature' not like the 'kids' employed by other carriers. What happened to your wonderful staff? Our recent flights were organised chaos crew were running round like unmanaged headless chickens. Admittedly they all seem very young and inexperienced including the person who seemed to be in charge. The cabin staff conversation quality was awful and most unprofessional. As for the new seats my extra leg room seat included was like sitting on a park bench and also narrower. The inflight book seems to bang on about the comfort and service offered - realistically it must be just Monarch's management that believe this. I don't think we will be gold card holders much longer sorry Monarch but you need to sort your product. You used to do it so well.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Just flown LGW - Malaga - LGW. Planes (A321) were both on time clean and best of all the non recline seats. Cabin crew very friendly all in all a very positive experience will certainly use them on all future Malaga trips.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Just come back from Cyprus with this airline I am 6 foot 4 and the seat leg room is unacceptable for a 5 hour plus flight. I spent most of the way standing at the back of the aircraft. How anyone should have to put up with seats with very little leg room and have to stand most of the journey speaks volumes about the bean counters at Monarch. Also the new seat design is very thin and you can feel the person behind you placing their water bottles in the seat holders which then stick in your back. This day and age travel should not be uncomfortable for 5 hour plus flights or any flights. Flew with Jet Blue last month on an internal flight to Boston and the leg room on a 40 minute flight form JFK was superior with room between my knees and the seat in front.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
ZB7428 18/11/14. Brilliant flight seating and staff. We have flown several times business to Perth and would have been happy with the level of comfort on our flight from East Midland to Malta. Home on 25th even looking forward to the return flight.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I am a gold member and fly very regularly from Spain to UK to visit my family. In the past 3 weeks alone I have taken 6 flights. New seats are awful. Although I am only 5ft. I find them very uncomfortable. Worst feature is they do not recline so it's impossible to change seating position. They also feel narrower than the old style seats. It would be helpful if cabin crew helped to put my bag in the overhead storage. I am a senior citizen and have to do an acrobatic act of climbing on the seat to reach to store my hand baggage and retrieve it at the end of the flight! Not many perks now for frequent loyal customers as once a year customers can now purchase priority boarding/check in for very little money.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew to Mallorca in October and the seating was horrendous. Had to squeeze in and then felt trapped as the seat in front was just a few inches away heaven help us if the person in front reclines the seat! So cramped that we were unable to lower the tray fully. For seat comfort space and leg room this was the second worst flight we have experienced. The flight back was so much better - comfortable seats sufficient room and we could lower the tray. No one had told us and we were not charged but it seems that they had upgraded us to seats with extra leg room. We have travelled extensively and this flight outward bound was quite appalling. My wife has some mobility problems and was developing leg cramps as we were coming into land. Despite the good flight back and the fact that Monarch did reply to our complaints I would still give them the lowest possible rating as we both feel we will never fly with Monarch again while their seating is so atrocious. The term "cattle truck" comes to mind!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We returned on November 7th from Tenerife to Manchester on extra legroom if there had not been a spare seat next to us I think we may have had to stand up for the remaining 2 hours of our flight. The new seats are so uncomfortable we try to fly Monarch as much as we can and we have always been supportive of the airline but I am not prepared to subject ourselves to another flight with those seats. They may be ok for short 2/3 hour flights but now the normal time to Tenerife being 4.5 hours is not acceptable for us.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Gatwick to Sanford first time flying with Monarch. Outward flight very impressed with check in at Gatwick baggage check in and cleared customs in half an hour quite disappointed only 20kg allowance on hold bags and 5kg for cabin luggage which is weighed at check-in. Seating on the outward flight was fine window and middle seat seats not bad for comfort and leg room coming back was in middle aisle row 14 and what a nightmare right under the drop down TV and as it was an overnight flight back struggled to sleep because of the flashing of the TV really wish I had an eye mask with me. Monarch supply blanked and pillow but earphones are charged at £2.50 I always take my own anyway so not a problem. Food - considering its airline food was not bad roast chicken stuffing roast potatoes/mash on return journey vegetables and gravy with bread roll cheese crackers and a cake of sorts water with the dinner and tea or coffee brought along. Breakfast a bit disappointing yoghurt and orange juice any other drinks or snacks can be purchased. We purchased from the airport after clearing customs snacks and drinks to take on board and so glad we did. Staff were friendly and professional. Would I recommend afraid not even though the value for money with the ticket was good hold baggage is extra cost to be seated together is extra cost and even then couldn't pick where we wanted to sit. Return flight was full and unfortunately not enjoyable because of the TV and unruly kids although this is not an airline problem.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Travelled from Gatwick to Alicante and back. On the way there had the new seats. They were comfy with a good amount of leg room for a budget flight. Seats were wide and seat belts were long. It was one of the most comfortable low cost flights I've had in years. On return we had old seats. I was shocked at the difference. There was no legroom I'm 59 and my knees were against the seat in front and were painful when I left the plane. It was also very tight to get the table down fully. I hope by next year all flights have the new seats as this would make me choose Monarch over other airlines.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Travelled with my 6 year old granddaughter to Malaga on 27/10/14 (ZB654) returning to Manchester on 31/10/14 (ZB655). Booked through Avros. Because I did not book directly with Monarch I was only allowed 5 kg of luggage per person and could not print boarding passes online. Both flights were on time and the pilot was very informative. I pre-booked seats to ensure that we were able to sit together and had seats 11D and 11E on both flights. It was the same aircraft on both flights I know this because the seat pocket for seat 11E was hanging off! There was a wodge of paper hankies stuck in the emergency exit door. I am 5 ft 7 inches and the leg room was totally unacceptable only one inch between my knees and the seat in front. I now realise why in the safety demonstration we were not given instruction on the brace position was because it would be physically impossible to do so on this aircraft. I would definitely never choose to fly with Monarch again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Our Birmingham to Gran Canaria flight was in an A321. Like many of our flights with this airline it was on time. The flight was a little late arriving thanks to strong headwinds but everything else was satisfactory in most ways. We paid for extra legroom seats and that was certainly worthwhile.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
DLM to LGW. Normal economy seat. Plane left on time staff were prompt bringing around food that I had pre ordered (very nice by the way cumberland sausage with a cider gravy. Mash potato and some roasted veg very impressive). Seats were comfortable maybe slightly small in the leg room but I'm only 5'8" and was fine for me. No inflight entertainment which would have been nice for a 4hr flight but had a tablet so can't complain. Staff very helpful drinks were over priced but can't do much about that.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Downgraded this review because of the fact that the "new seats" are the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in on an airplane. Getting off the plane after a 4 hr flight - the sole topic of conversation amongst all around us was how bad the seats were. We fly with Monarch about 8 times pa - not anymore unless they do something to improve seat comfort.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Absolutely Brilliant. LPA-BHX. Night flight staff were very good though check in was a little slow. Flight was amazingly smooth paid for legroom upgrade. Upgraded legroom seats had much more legroom than Ryanair's seats. Would fly again. Night flight so great views and pilot kept us well informed during the flight.

We should have flown on ZB1529 from Enfidha to Gatwick at 19.25 on 24 Sept. We finally flew from Tunis at 02.30 the next day. We were not given any information no food or drink. Feel totally let down by the airline and no customer service as we were finally moved in busses in the dead of night.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Shocking! Do not use Monarch! We are stuck in Madeira with a four hour delay so far and absolutely no information so far flying on a Cosmos package. Likely to be stuck here for the night and will miss our connecting flight. The worst thing is the absolute lack of information. I will never use Monarch again.

Flight out ZB1354 MAN-DBV 14/10 Return ZB1355 18/10. Easy check in departed on time arrived 30 minutes early. Return journey on time. We had booked extra leg room seats and meals ok on outward journey but on return journey allocated standard seats a word with a flight attendant an on showing our invoice we quickly moved to our correct seats all in all enjoyable flights.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew from Manchester to Sharm El Sheikh return recently (ZB 685). Simply one of the worst flying experiences I've had. We did book extra leg room at the airport for £15 which was a good idea because once on board it was £25! The outbound flight did not serve any refreshments until 2 hours into the flight - but did manage to hand out magazines. The duty free trolley on the way back was empty and the crew said this was due to it being busy on the other flight! They also didn't inform us that the Duty Free at the airport would be closed when we arrived (on arrival the airport staff told us that the airline should have passed this information to us). The worst part however was absolutely no in-flight entertainment for a 6 hour flight. We were told by the crew that this was because most people took their own entertainment with them. I haven't been lied to like this for a long long time. If you can't be bothered to show entertainment then at least have the front to be honest about it. I personally didn't see anyone around me with an iPad. Added to this was the screaming child we had for the 6 hours - at the very least a movie would have taken my mind off this. Shocking service on all levels the crew just appeared to be going through the motions. I won't be flying with Monarch again and I will certainly be passing this message around all my friends and colleagues (which is extensive).

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I am a frequent flyer with Monarch and a holder of a Vantage card and have experienced an overall decline in conditions and standards over the past three years. It seems that departure times are more of an arbitrary suggestion the cabin staff are certainly not welcoming the food is of a very low quality and as for the new seats these are simply terrible very cheap low standard and incredibly uncomfortable - certainly not something you would choose to sit on for more ten minutes. The most recent flight I travelled was on October the 14th from Larnaca to London Luton. The flight was 45 minutes late taking off - the seats were awful and several had broken and repaired with duct tape. They ran out of tea and took one hour to get our luggage on to the carousel. Would I use again no.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew EMA-Faro on 5th and returned on 15th quick check in at both ends flights on time aircraft clean and well presented the staff on board were helpful. There was a lack of legroom between the seats and the new type seats are not all that comfortable very hard and lack padding but were suffice for a two hour twenty minute trip. Will use again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Travelled from London Gatwick to Funchal with Monarch and was pleasantly surprised. Seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room and onboard catering seemed reasonably priced. Would fly Monarch again based on this experience.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flight staff great a vast improvement on Ryanair. It felt more like flying 20 years ago the way it should be. I'm 63" and found it impossible to sit comfortably due to the lack of leg room - had we not been lucky to have a spare seat on our row I would have been forced to stand throughout the flight. I will never fly Monarch again because of he leg room issue so back to Ryanair where the leg room is more than ample.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Premium Upgrade to SAN (FL) well worth it but having travelled on the Dreamliner with Thomson I would not consider flying monarch again. The drink service isn't regular enough on the flight. The entertainment system is poor not anywhere near Thomson B787. Monarch is definitely cheaper though but I would rather pay the extra 150GBP each way in future to fly Thomson. I would recommend for short haul. Not long haul.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew Birmingham to Split and return. Offered half price extra leg room seats on way out as plane only third full which we accepted. Check in took only ten minutes on both flights. Planes took off and returned on time. Took own refreshments so just had tap water on board. Staff were friendly and professional on both flights they did run out of things for the return journey. Seat comfort was ok for the two and a half hour flights but would not want much longer in them. Our seats on both flights did recline so I presume they were the old planes. Did notice that the extra leg room seats offered a significant difference. Overall good value for money.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We travelled from Manchester to Orlando - took 13 hours because it was delayed and then we didn't get moving for hours whilst on the plane. The staff were rude and didn't care. I didn't eat anything and they don't have TVs in the back of the seats. I thought I had solved the problem by taking my iPad with films on however there where no plug sockets so the ipad ran out of battery. Boring is not the word. The flight back was quicker but we were still delayed by an hour. Never again. We thought cheap flight and a better hotel but we quickly realised that this was a mistake. Just booked for next year and we have not booked with Monarch and will not do so again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I'm sad to say between our family members we've flown eight times with Monarch in the past 5 months (4 return flights) and all those were an absolute nightmare. None were on time (varied between 3 and 5 hours previously unannounced and uncommunicated delays). We had to fight to get snack vouchers they didn't want to hand out. Their UK ground handlers (at different airports) failed to turn up on time to deliver steps and buses to remote gates so passengers were left standing on the planes for 45 minutes after landing before they could even get off the planes. That was before they discovered there were no baggage handlers either. So they and other plane loads of passengers were left sat on the floor of arrivals halls with nothing happening no luggage and no information and screamingly hungry kids to boot with nowhere for parents of babies to get baby formula for bottles. Passengers were finally and insultingly told to go home and go back the next day for luggage. When your destination is hundreds of miles away from the airport you'd actually want to do the round trip again the next day? The food (very poor quality) is as overpriced as the pathetic snack selection. There's no entertainment there were no blankets or pillows (even if you were willing to pay for them) and they kept a couple with a young baby waiting half of a five hour flight for a baby's bottle to be warmed. Result one screaming kid for three hours. Thank you Monarch. They don't update passengers about flight delays or baggage delays. As a family we all did the honourable thing and gave them a second chance before having to acknowledge they still screwed everything up. Monarch don't apologise and they refuse to pay compensation as required to do under EU law. We'll never ever fly with them again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Poor premium economy. Just back from Florida. Aircraft was old many monitors not working the guy next to me had no tray table attached at all. He was given an upturned cardboard box on his lap to eat his dinner from. No drinks offered on return leg with dinner. In fairness food was ok. Overall not what we paid for.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flight from Gatwick to Sanford Florida (wheelchair user). Check in was efficient but did not have a lower down counter at Gatwick. 40 minute delay but this was made up whilst en route. Retained wheelchair until the gate. Priority boarding which helped a lot. Lots of room in overhead lockers probably due to the strict one piece of hand luggage rule being applied. Seats felt a bit claustrophobic despite it being in the premium cabin. Could have been because the seat in front kept reclining as it was faulty. Legroom not too bad (I am 6'3" big build long legs). Access to the aisle was good once I learnt how to raise the arm rest. Cabin crew were fantastic. Lots of food and drink always served with a smile. Quite a roomy disabled toilet on board (Airbus A330). Easy disembarkation process. Sanford is an easy airport to use. All in all a very reasonable outward flight. The claustrophobic feeling in the seats is the only reason for not awarding top marks.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We travel on the BHX-Tenerife route frequently and have found the punctuality pretty good apart from odd blip  in fact most flights land earlier than scheduled cabin crew always friendly and the on board snacks of good quality and price (especially the bacon panini!) seats are pretty tight however no issue getting and walking around if you want to stretch your legs new seats don't recline so that sorts out the inconsiderates who recline the seat in front the minute they sit down. Planes always full or close to being full sorry to see Monarch are struggling financially hopefully they will sort things out as route and flight times really convenient. No inflight entertainment but don't most people have Ipods and tablets these days?

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew from London Gatwick to Sanford Florida with my wife and two daughters had an excellent flight in premium cabin meals seats and a truly professional and friendly service from the cabin crew of Monarch Airlines and the same is said with our return flight back to London Gatwick. The only issue Monarch need to address is the inflight entertainment and I'm sure I speak for everybody on the aircraft picture quality variety makes a long haul flight a long long flight.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
The flights were on time. The outbound flight was an A321 in good condition and the return was the same but a bit older. The flight attendants were well presented in smart uniforms and did there jobs very well. We had booked inflight meals which were of a good standard. The return flight was quite bumpy due to storms and the food service was stopped due to the rough conditions which I must agree with. Maybe an extra 1 inch of legroom would be good.

28th Sept 2014 ZB 569 flight Tenerife to Manchester 20.55 delayed 16 hours No Monarch staff present to explain - Iberia staff took us to overnight stay in Santa Cruz. Reason given no crew available. On flight home Pilot gave mechanical failure on previous flight resulted in a delay to obtain parts. If you look at previous claims Monarch seem to use Technical problems to avoid compensation claims.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew Premium from London Gatwick to Sanford Florida with my wife and 2 daughters and had a wonderful flight outbound and inbound the meals were excellent. Monarch flight crew very professional and friendly and we found the seats comfortable. The only down side was the inflight entertainment poor quality TV screens and no available information on what is showing on the flight not that it is worth it. Not good if you are on a long haul flight.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Have always enjoyed Monarch flights to Turkey but never again - the new seats do not recline but worse still are cheap nasty and almost agonisingly uncomfortable. I got back ache within half of take-off. By the end of the flight I had pins and needles in my right leg. One man in front of me decided to sit on the cabin floor with his back to the cabin wall rather than endure his seat anymore! The extra legroom is a joke because Monarch require you to put some bags under the seat in front which negates the benefits of the extra leg room. Now expensive with appalling seats!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We flew back from Dalaman to Manchester on the 22.20 flight. I had seat 22A which meant a window seat for me. My wife had 22B. The seat was fine and the legroom adequate. I am 5'8" tall and 160lbs. The wife is 4'10" and 116lbs. I could stretch my legs out under the seat in front and I slept for 2 hours unaided by alcohol as I was driving at the other end. I didn't recline the seat. Taller and wider people have an advantage in life generally as they tend to look down on smaller people. So the 4 hour flight was a good experience for us. The flight crew were courteous and we would fly with Monarch again. Taller people who are generally more advantaged should pay for extra legroom or drive or sail.

26/05/2014 Luton - Mahon ZB38. 30/05/2014 Mahon - Luton ZB39. Have flown with Monarch many times from Luton airport the last trip we took as a couple was to Mahon which we found to be very good. Customer service was excellent and the flight was very comfortable. Snacks were very good value for an airline.

We flew from Dalaman to Birmingham on 22nd September 2014. Punctuality was very good in fact we arrived back early. Spacious overhead lockers very fast baggage reclaim good legroom because of non reclining seats. Staff were efficient and cheerful. Food not required. The only bad point is the hardness of the seat and the short back of the seat. Would fly with Monarch again but take a neck pillow and something to soften the seat. Information and booking was good. The tablet holder was good but I do not have one. There was good room under the seat for books in a bag.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I travel regularly on the MAN-AGP service and the cabin staff have always been polite and efficient. Flight deck mostly give information of use and sometimes with humour. Time keeping outbound has been good but return from AGP can be frustrating as other low cost airlines appear to shout loudest and depart on schedule. It may be a case of confronting the ground handling agent as to why this happens so often. The new seats are hard and uncomfortable especially for taller travellers they have a low back that sticks into your lower should blades. Just about bearable on a 2/3 hour trip but any longer and would be torture. Overall a great airline but a few tweaks by management needed on their operational side. They could give the other low cost airlines a run for their money and worth an extra £5 each way extra on seat cost. Just tell passengers what they are getting for their money no hidden surprises.

We flew with Monday 15th September flying from Gatwick to Alicante. The plane and cabin staff were excellent. We have travelled with lots of different airlines and rate this as one of the best.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Recently flew Birmingham to Hurghada. When checking in I asked if we could sit as close to the front of the plane as possible and was allocated row 10. Legroom was ok but seats were of the old variety. I thought Monarch were retrofitting their seats so it was disappointing to get the old armchair seats. Service Onboard was great. Check in at Hurghada was a different story. I again asked if we could be sat quite close to the front but was told that we had to pay for extra legroom seats. Speaking to one check in agent he said it was £30 per seat but as 5 people were travelling he would do us a deal of 3 seats for the price of 5. I doubt this was company procedure and the monies would have made their way into the check in agents pockets. Appreciate Monarch can't vouch for all those working in behalf of the company but they need to be aware that others are trying to profit from their usual jobs as we have been seated in what are the extra legroom seats on return flights free of charge previously. Service was slow onboard but we landed 40 mins ahead of schedule.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Monarch airlines are too basic. Although we had issues Monarch made our 3 hour journey to Corfu in August very dull and boring. No entertainment no blankets or pillows on night flights and the food had no variety and was a rip off. Whilst sitting on the flight waiting to leave we saw our luggage being taken off the plane then later we were told they had put the our luggage in another plane and theirs on ours so had to wait for the swap! Lovely staff though and great pilots.

Monarch informed me in advance of time change of outbound flight due to operational reasons. I understand this is happening to all airlines not just Monarch. I was more annoyed as the inbound flight was delayed 2 hours. Check-in agent didn't inform neither me nor other passengers of the delay. When we checked-in at Manchester we were met by an unprofessional lady who seemed not to care about customer service. We were given 2 aisle seats I chose not to pay for online check-in but I asked if there was any chance seating next to my girlfriend the response was: no I'm sorry plane is full. Once we were aboard the plane was half empty. Monarch cabin crew are really good and professional.

Manchester to Antalya 4-11th September. Flights 0520 and 0521. Flight on time. Service good but cramped seating and legroom which meant your knees touched the seat in front made the journey most uncomfortable. Impossible to cross legs or stand up to relieve discomfort. Monarch seem to have increased the number of extra legroom seats at the expense of other passengers presumably to make more money. Never again.

We were involved in last week's Luton evacuation. After a 3 hour flight from Malaga (landed 14:15pm) we were unable to exit the aircraft for another 5 hours. There was no offer of food or beverages apart from a cup of warm water (self serve). We did not receive regular updates we could see other people outside on the tarmac. The pilot was obnoxious telling us that "at least we had a seat" and I did not feel he was advocating on our behalf to get us off given that the news reports advise the airport was reopened shortly after the 5:15pm "controlled explosion" and we did not exit the aircraft until after 6:30pm. The pilot advised that they too were stuck on the aircraft however as I pointed out his seats weren't near the toilets he had a nice view (and I would hazard a guess some refreshments). The crew also felt it was appropriate to eat their wraps and peanuts in front of us when we were not offered any refreshments. They gave us some story about "customs regulations". Even the Luton Airport staff offered us bottles of water as we exited. The toilets we disgusting after the first 2 hours with so many people using them and our seats were just outside. You can really tell the calibre of an organisation in a crisis and Monarch fell well short in my opinion. Absolutely disgraceful!

This was my first time attempting to fly with Monarch and I will never try this again. The date of travel was 8th Sept 2014 when there was a security alert at Luton Airport where the flight was to originate. I will only address my remarks to Monarch rather than the chaos and mayhem which occurred at the airport. The basic problem was their complete lack of communication with passengers and the complete lack of any Monarch representatives at the airport. All the other airlines were decisive even if it meant the cancellation of flights and made some effort to assist their passengers. I could not help noticing that Ryanair were the first back on their feet and giving coherent advise to their passengers. After waiting hours after the other airlines Monarch cancelled everything giving no guidance as to how we should get out of the departure area when and where we could get our baggage back what if anything we were now being offered etc. The screens in the baggage arrival hall were out of action and it appears that Monarch simply put all the bags from their cancelled flights on any carousel where space was available even if these were being used for the now incoming flights as well. I could go on about this airline where unrelated strike action is now forecast which gives me yet another reason not to use them again.

Manchester - Alicante 31st August. Due departure 17.30. Actual departure 21.20. Flying with Monarch is becoming a gamble as far as punctuality is concerned. A later flight was cancelled and I believe consolidated with ours due to lack of passengers. It's a great shame as we've used them for 10 years fairly regularly and the flight staff are generally pretty good. However Ryanair are much more punctual! Already suffering financially - if they don't sort these problems they will not be around much longer! Daughter flew with them last night on same route - 5 hour delay!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Just flown back from Dalaman Turkey with Monarch Airlines. By far the worst seats I have experienced on a plane. The new seats are fixed back they do not recline. This wouldn't be so bad if they were actually comfortable however they are not. The seats are covered with only a thin layer of padding you may as well be sitting on a plastic chair and they are curved to reflect the curvature of the spine this is great however it means the only way to try and sit comfortably is bolt upright! When you do this there is nowhere to rest your head as the seats are quite short. You end up having to rest your head back onto a rock hard edge. Our flight was 05.00am. As you can imagine everyone on board was tired. The whole plane was full of people moaning how bad the seats were. Personally I would rather pay a little extra on another airline than fly with Monarch again because of this. I do hope Monarch read these reviews and take customer complaints seriously as they have lost a customer in me.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Terrible reliability. We were flying Manchester to Barcelona to meet our cruise ship and were sat on the tarmac for over an hour whilst they tried to fix a technical fault. I think they were on the brink of cancelling the flight as a replacement part could not be found then it just started working again. On the return flight we landed on time and then stood around for over an hour in baggage reclaim due to another "technical problem" as they couldn't open the door to offload the cases - we certainly wont be flying with them again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew from Gatwick to Antalya in Turkey in September. Flight out was delayed a little but what aren't these days. Seats were so comfortable and the design of them allowed everyone to have so much leg room they thought they had paid for an upgrade. Flight back was bang on time. Service by the crew was excellent. I have flown with Monarch many times to Antalya now and have only ever had positive outcomes.

I had the misfortune of travelling back from Venice on a Monarch flight on Saturday. I will never travel with them again. The fiasco started with the baggage deposit and boarding ticket collection in Venice airport at 11am. No quick line for baggage hand-over the weighing belts failed general chaos ensued. Finally everyone was processed and flight on time 12.50 to Gatwick confirmed. 12.30 arrived and we were told boarding on time proceed to gate 26. By now there were rumours the flight would not take off from Venice till 4pm. Gate 26 showed delay till 1.15 questions asked of Monarch reps and were told French air traffic control problems so new take off time 3pm. Manchester flight just the same. We were told no person from Monarch was in the airport. Vouchers given out for drink and snack but with huge numbers affected cafe could not cope. Take off time now 4pm. 3.30pm told to board at last. Got onboard at 3.45pm then told by captain we would take off shortly as there was a dispute of Italian workers which would end at 4.30pm. 5pm we finally took off staff would not honour the vouchers of the people who had not been able to redeem them in Venice. The captain then informed passengers that they knew of this strike at 6am as did most of the world. As far as I and I believe everyone on that flight no longer have faith in the liars from Monarch.

We flew from Birmingham airport UK on Tuesday 31st August to Tenerife. We have flown with Monarch many times before and have been pleased each time. However things seem to have changed. The new seats are terrible the fact they don't recline is no problem but the lack of thickness of it makes the seat uncomfortable after an hour. The staff were the worst we have encountered.

LGW to Skiathos on August 22nd returning on 29th. Outbound delay of nearly 3 hours return delay (so far) 4.5 hours. Monarch certainly knows how to undermine your holiday experience. My advice: find an alternative.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We flew Gatwick to Heraklion. Airbus A321 both ways the staff were very friendly and helpful. Delayed 2 hours leaving Gatwick but was no problem as staff kept us well informed. Monarch's newer seats have more legroom than the old ones but are far less comfortable than the old seats as the new ones don't recline and they're quite solid. But it's only a short flight so it's fine. Would fly monarch again and happily recommend.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Just flown back from Gibraltar with them. The flight was delayed passenger boarding eventually started then stopped. Chaos ensued with very angry ground staff doing their best. Once onboard the loading stopped again as the disabled passengers suddenly arrived for boarding clearly no liaison with ground. What followed was like a scene from a comedy film terrible. Eventually and after much delay we got underway. Complete bunch of amateurs. If this is what they call fighting for their jobs well best of luck they will need it. Plenty of alternatives out there.

MAN-SSH (plane reg GS-MAN) flew also on GS-MAN last year and flight was very good cabin staff lovely and attentive boarding was seamless and so was the disembarkation which took place at 12 am midnight. Monarch staff in both airports brilliant.

LGW to ACE 24/7/14 return 8/8/14. Good on time flights in extra legroom seats well worth the extra cost. In flight meals also very good and much improved. New plane on the way out. Cabin crew very obliging. Overall a good start and finish to our holiday.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flown twice this year with Monarch - Tenerife in April then Orlando in July. Both times really impressed especially the Orlando flights. We upgraded to the Premier cabin which both being 6ft I'm glad we did. Plenty of leg room. Coming back you are given free entry to the airport lounge with two free beers and free snacks great way to relax. Boarded first and our luggage was taken off first so no waiting at Gatwick. Better than our BA flight last year to Orlando.

Birmingham flight to Venice ZB 5484. 27th July. Local radio warns of delays on busy weekend so arrive 3 hours before take off takes nearly 3 hours to check in not because of volume of passengers but because only 2 of the 10 desks were open! Situation not helped by the fact that 3 desks were open for online check in! After 1 hour Monarch staff resorted to calling for people whose flights were imminent to go over to the online desks. It was only after this that the online desk opened to everyone else. Flight was delayed for 20 minutes and onboard staff were not aware of check in problems. Not a good start to a holiday an explanation would be appreciated as to why only 2 desks were open for what was known to be a very busy weekend.

Gatwick to Faro 22/7/2014. Plane due to depart 06.50 finally went 10.10. Accept there are delays and technical problems which need to be resolved before planes take off. The issue is always communication. Having been called to the gate as expected it is the lack of updates to advise what is happening. When will airlines realise that the issue just annoys it's clients. The most infuriating issue is the ground staff do not give frequent enough updates especially when the updates provided contradict a text you have previously received from the airline text service to say the delay will be longer and this is the true time. It's funny how the staff don't want to tell you truth which is all the passenger wants. Please learn.

Flew Monarch but flight was chartered by Simpson Travel so check in separate therefore am unable to comment on this aspect. Flight itself was excellent in every respect. Friendly helpful staff who made the journey pleasant. Food some of the best airline food I have had the larger carriers could learn from their suppliers. We paid for extra legroom but on the return we were in the new aircraft which has plenty of room in the non extra legroom seats so I would check whether you need to pay for the extra space on short flights. Would definitely fly with them again.

Recently flew Gatwick to Sanford premium economy I was very worried as I had read many bad reviews but there was no need. From the moment we checked in the service was excellent we had no delays boarding and take off were very quick. The leg room was great I'm 5 ft 4 and my husband 5 ft 10 and we were very pleased with the spacious comfortable seats we had. We sat in rows A 34 and B 34 there were TVs in the seat backs entertainment was great with a good choice of films. We had a continuous service from the air hostesses with drinks and food and my daughters enjoyed their free blankets. On arrival the airport did keep us waiting to disembark but this was not Monarch's fault. Premium economy passengers luggage comes off first so it was a quick get away too. Would definitely fly Monarch again.

Naples to Luton 25th July ZB 3596 0 put on a faulty plane for 3 hours. Taken off spent 5.5 hours corralled in airport with nowhere to sit. Given 12 euro vouchers for refreshments in airport which were refused at the till. Taken to hotel in Naples overnight. Taken back to airport could not check in as computer said no. Eventually boarded plane and took off 2.5 hours late as 18 people had vanished leaving bags on board. These had to be removed. No food on plane. No communication in airport. Eventually got to Luton over 22 hours Late. Disgusting treatment and a whole wasted day. Never again. Spoilt my holiday.

Travelled on flight MON349 from Gatwick to Orlando Sanford. Flight was delayed by an hour which although it sounds bad we made up time and landed only 5-10 minutes late. The plane although it is old it was perfectly fine and the seats were in brilliant condition. You are supplied with a clean fleecy blanket and pillow which are very comfortable. The flight was good meal service was served twice and rubbish collections were frequent. The only negative would be the in-flight entertainment as there are no seatback TV's only in the aisle movies are old and bad quality. But I brought my tablet and watched some movies on there which were perfectly fine. Overall the flight was good and although it's not the likes of Virgin and BA you get what you pay for which is the cheapest.

I have just flown from Manchester to Faro. 1 hour delay on the outbound due to bad weather and heavy traffic 1/2 hour on the way back too but actually made the time back due to a strong tail wind. Aircraft was a new A321 very clean quiet and smooth on both sectors with adequate legroom too . Cabin crew very attentive and friendly and very informative updates from the flight deck. The Captain actually came into the cabin on the inbound leg and was making my little boy laugh! Overall very impressed with them and would have no hesitation in flying with this excellent airline in the future. NO IFE on board for reference.

Flew from Birmingham to Las Palmas (23/06/14) returned (01/07/14). We flew on the airbus A321 which I believe is one of their newer fleet. Now down to the nitty gritty! 100% would fly with Monarch again.. Take off 15 mins late but arrived 10 mins early took off on time coming back and was back half an hour early. Check in was good both ways went smoothly including collecting luggage! Staff both ways were friendly and polite plenty of leg room too! Having flown with Thomson last year this plane was far better. Food was expensive but nonetheless tasty!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We have flown with Monarch many times this time (8/7/14) from East Midlands to Tenerife. As always we had a very pleasant experience! Online check-in meant we didn't have to queue at the airport. There were plenty of baggage drop desks and no problem getting through. The plane was on time and landed early due to a tail wind. The new cabins look very smart and I found the new seats to be very comfortable. I'm glad they've done away with the reclining seats. Who wants to spend 4hours with passenger in front's head inches away from your face? We always pay for extra legroom as my partner is 6'7" and so we have no complaints about legroom. The plane was spotless I think having a place for your tablet/iPad is a genius idea. The cabin crew were all very efficient. I think the inflight food and drinks are expensive though but it's up to you if you want to buy or not. I saw one passenger with her packed lunch so I suppose you could always do the same. Having flown with Jet2 and Easyjet recently I find Monarch to be a cut above the usual Budget airlines. As I said I have flow with Monarch many times and I still will.

Absolutely pleasantly surprised. Flew from Dubrovnik to Gatwick and despite leaving 15min late we arrived 10min early. The cabin crew were friendly attentive and smiling throughout the flight. Well done Monarch already looking forward to the next holiday flight.

They are still selling the flight we should be going back home on of which should of been a reasonable hr at 11.10 arriving at Manchester at 1.35am now departing at 1.50 am and landing at 4.05 am.

ZB648 2nd July and ZB649 7th July. Return flight with to Larnaca. Good points flights on time and UK bag drop was quick and easy. Bad points was not impressed with the service not one single member of staff spoke to us. Very budget airline ok for a 2 hr flight but not for anything longer. The seats were very uncomfortable and no entertainment of any sort provided. Check in process at Larnaca airport was a farce and took over an hour just to drop bags as we had already checked in online to "speed up" the process. I spoke to a member of staff at the airport about poor service and was ignored I have since emailed them and again have been ignored.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Excellent flight from Leeds Bradford to Larnaca. Flight left 15 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early. Pre- booked extra legroom seats which were very comfortable with lots of space. Almost new A320 very quite and smooth. They had a special offer on pre-booked meals so took advantage of the offer. I wasn't expecting much in quality but was pleasantly surprised how good and tasty the whole meal was and it even included a free Kenco coffee which would have cost us £2.50 anyway so for £7.00 excellent value for money. Cabin crew were very attentive and pretty much refrained from the shouting offers that you get on Jet 2 flights. Return flight was affected by ATC strikes but was reassured to receive a text message from Monarch on the morning of departure advising that our flight was still operating although it may be subject to delay. They pulled out all the stops and we returned 2 hours late. This is the first time I have flown with Monarch for quite a few years and they are definitely a cut above other low cost airlines. I just hope that they expand their destinations from Leeds Bradford even more as Jet 2 and their ancient 'planes are becoming too complacent. Well done Monarch and looking forward to flying with you again from LBA to Lanzarote in November.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I recently travelled from Luton to Sharm El Shiek. I have to say the catering has greatly improved. There was a choice of main course meals which were imaginative and very tasty I had the Mediterranean beef which was like a Greek Stifardo. Also Monarch have stopped doing teas and coffees in those silly little cups on a tray with the most awful stewed cheap tasting coffee. They now have large PG Tips or Kenco cardboard cups with decent flavoured coffee. I do have a gripe. I really miss having an in-flight film on flights of more than 3 hours. Egypt was over 5 and I think that is long flight with no entertainment. Also seats must be more flimsy as I increasingly feel peoples knees etc digging in.

MON349 - 5th June 2014 inbound MON348 13th June 2014. Recently returned from a weeks holiday to Florida booked with Monarch. I have absolutely no complaints about them at all. The concierge team are brilliant answering all our questions in a reasonable amount of time all staff were friendly and couldn't seem to do enough for you. The plane was an A330 and although I was told by another passenger that it was older than her (she must have been 60) it was really clean and in my opinion had plenty of leg room. The food was plentiful although I did think the food on the outbound flight was a lot better than the inbound one. All seats had a clean fleece and pillow and if not upgrading to premium seating all had good views of the overhead TV screens. I wouldn't hesitate to use Monarch/Cosmos again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Venice to Gatwick on Thursday 3rd July. Never again. The outward flight check-in was disorganised. When we got on the aircraft it was as cramped as I have ever experienced. At least it got there (to Venice) on time. The return flight was two hours late setting off and boiling hot. One member of staff was quite unsmiling - perhaps she was as fed up as we were. Water was £1.70 a bottle. When we arrived in Gatwick we just sat there - the steps were not there the doors did not open. Eventually we disembarked. The baggage took ages to partly-arrive and even longer before it arrived in full. We were late tired and fed up. As I said never again. The one compensation is that it did at least get us to and from our destination. That's the only positive I can offer.

Manchester to Barcelona and return. Great flights - new plane (Airbus 321) seating ok for 6ft 2" person flights on time both ways cabin crew very helpful to less able passengers (helping with bags etc) and friendly - even though flight was packed. Good control of louder passengers. Good information from the flight deck - no hard sell. Overall - very impressed.

Flew twice with Monarch. Outbound and Inbound. My flights were ZB994 and ZB995 20/06/14-27/06/14 Birmingham to Hurghada and back. First time flying Monarch Hurghada new destination for them. Thought give it a try as they were offering really good prices compared to other airlines. £178 each way per person which is really good for Egypt! Flights on time cabin crew were really polite and helpful on both flights. Check in staff are really good. We arrived early for check in and they checked us in early as well as checking in the hand luggage too. Had the old cabin on both flights G-OZBE on ZB994 and G-OZBG on ZB995. Cabin's are really cramped for a 6 hour flight but for the price we paid couldn't really expect first class no entertainment provided either which was surprising for a long flight was prepared anyway bringing my own. Would recommend would travel again.

On Friday 28th June we were in Alicante waiting for ZB 682 to arrive all other Monarch flights were on time. Eventually the flight came up on the board. Passengers assembled waiting to embark on a flight that had at that time not arrived this lasted for more than 1 hour. On the eventual embarkation the Captain explained that they had experienced a slight technical problem which took a few minutes to resolve. When fixed requested a push back from the handlers Swiss Air who reportedly said their employees where committed elsewhere. 1 hour later the plane was put into service. On arrival the turn around was reasonable. The return journey was good until we reached the flagship Manchester Airport where we waited for 1 hour 20 minutes for the luggage to appear.

On the return flight from Venice to Gatwick we were prompted by the announcement over the tannoy that we could now purchase hot and cold snacks and drinks as displayed in the flight brochure. We were only about 6 rows from the back of the plane but when we asked for bacon paninis we were told that they didn't have any or any rolls or any sandwiches. We then asked for muffins only to be told that they had none of these either. When we asked the attendants why they advertised products that they did not sell we were told that "they had a busy outward flight"! We are only average sized people but found the seat spaces to be very cramped thankfully only for the 2hr flight.

This is the 3rd time we've had a very uncomfortable flight I'm 5ft 5 and was cramped my husband is a lot taller and he had his knees jammed into the seat in front and couldn't move if this is a sample of Thomson and Monarch cost cutting we will be making sure we travel with a different operator in future. To be fair the crew were ok and looked after passengers. When we arrived at Birmingham we were on the far side of the tarmac and had to be bussed in at 1am.

Cramped seats chocolate sauce on floor from previous flight which I had to cover up with napkins. Aggressive cabin crew - hassling me about a case in the locker which didn't belong to me - telling another passenger to behave because he standing up when in fact he'd been to the toilet and requested to do this from another crew member - no apology offered. Patronizing lecture about zero-tolerance of bad behaviour - do they think they are the Police force or something? Not a cheap flight either £200 Manchester-Portugal - yet they have the budget Arline mentality that we are cattle and they can be patronising and arrogant with us.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
First time I have ever travelled on Monarch from Gatwick to Faro - never again. Outbound flight ZB216 should have arrived at 16.30 but only arrived at 19.00. Return flight ZB217 was also delayed but the seating is deplorable no leg room and when you fold down the tray you are wedged in your seat with no space at all. Seating also very worn exposed springs generally rather "down at heel". Certainly an airline to be avoided.

On flight ZB932 from B-ham to Tenerife 10/06/2014 plane had the New seats fitted. Slim line seats give the feel of more room but the base of the seat is virtually unpadded. Cannot believe these seats have been tested by any senior management maybe they should have them fitted in the boardroom I will guarantee the meeting will not last more than 1 hour let alone 4 hours the flight time to Tenerife. Came back on the old seated plane what a difference its called comfort.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I cannot understand why people complain about Monarch. OK our flight to Tenerife was 3 hours late going and 3 hours late coming back (all our other Monarch flights have been just about on time). However the A330 airbus was one of the best aircraft's we've been on in years. The extra leg room seats in the front compartment were great and it was very quiet compared to other aircraft's we've flown on. But here is your food for thought. While other airlines have come and gone over the years Monarch have been on the scene since 1968.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Used Monarch to fly from Lanzarote - Manchester 2nd June. I am compelled to write a review as the seat quality was the worst I have ever experienced on any form of transport. Literally old bus seats are better. The seats are narrow not cushioned no legroom nowhere to store anything eg sweets magazines. I am 6" and 13.5 stone. My head was above the seats my knees touched the seat in front and there is just no room. The flight was a night - I was with my kids who were trying to sleep - the stewardesses kept waking them up - unforgivable. We travelled to Lanzarote on Thomas Cook - I sincerely regret choosing Monarch for return fight and will Never use them again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Booked on a Monarch flight from Rome to Birmingham on 8th June. Flight was cancelled just prior to boarding time. We received no support or assistance at all. All we were told was to email Monarch customer relations. I did not have the facility to do this. No concern shown as to whether anyone had money to make alternative flight arrangements or obtain food. I am a diabetic so could have been left without any food or medication but luckily had taken my credit card so managed to purchase something to eat and tickets back to Birmingham via Munich. I would never travel with Monarch again as they seem to have no acceptance of any duty of care to their customers. Absolutely inexcusable lack of care for all booked on that flight. Disgrace!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew Monarch to Funchal in May. ZB746. Inbound and outbound on time. Plane very clean and staff very friendly with nice smiles. Heavy cross wind at Funchal made for difficult landing (one of the most taxing airports in the world) but the captain did a great job getting us down safely after the first attempt was aborted. Would always choose Monarch ahead of Easyjet and would not contemplate RyanAir.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flight 533 from Majorca to Manchester 1st June. This flight left Majorca 2 hours later than stated. This in itself is not a major complaint. What was annoying was the failure of the staff and airline to provide information about the delay. The only information that was given was a terse phrase on the flights board. the only information that was given was shortly before the arrival of the delayed flight that it was due to land in 15 minutes. Communication is everything. To neglect it and your customers is a major error of judgement.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I recently took my first flight with Monarch Airlines and found the experience was not a good one. Since booking the flight in January the flight time was changed twice and brought forward by several hours. The first time I received absolutely no notification from Monarch and it was discovered entirely by chance. As we were a large group living 100 miles from the airport this had a big impact on our travel plans. On arrival at the airport we found the check-in staff were rude unhelpful and altogether unpleasant. This continued whilst on the flight making the whole experience one I would not wish to repeat. I was with a different airline on my return journey and found the opposite - it was a great friendly service offered for 1/3 of the price. I should also mention that the in-flight food was appalling - overpriced served at a dangerously high temperature and essentially inedible.

Flew 2nd June from Cyprus and had the new style seats. This is the 2nd time as had in October last year as well. They are the most uncomfortable plane seats I have ever had the misfortune to sit in. They are narrower than before and also have virtually no padding. My partner is 6'2" and his head is way above the top of the seat. This means there is no support at al. They have made the aisle wider which means the seating area has to be narrower. Monarch really are not listening to their customers. I would rather travel further to another airport than suffer these seats again. I think if you are short and on a 2 hour flight you can suffer these but for 4 plus hours they really are not acceptable.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
ZB546 MAN- ACE. Have travelled on this route numerous times and always been happy with the experience but was very disappointed with my flight on Thurs. Check in - Bag drop desk manned by member of staff who had started that day told luggage too heavy and tried to charge £120 excess baggage despite both cases being under allowance printed on our boarding card obviously not trained very well. Had to get Supervisor to sort out. Boarding at gate 300 at Manchester always means a delay when using the remote stands why don't they start the process a few minutes earlier. Gate again staffed by obviously new staff very disorganised and checking of ticket against passport lax to say the least which is concerning. On board for almost 90 mins before take off as two people checked in bags and not turned up at gate so quite rightly bags had to be found and removed. Surely however given it took an hour to find the bags the people must of turned up by then surely common sense should prevail and if people found and bags not let the people fly. I did wonder given no checks were made on board to double check if the people had boarded in the confusion at the gate if this was just an excuse as I know this flight has departed over an hour late every week for the past five weeks. Can't wait for my trip later in the summer on the same flight to see if the same people don't turn up again. Flight ok this was one of the older A321's with new seating which was not comfortable. Our return flight was put back two hours a few weeks before we came away from 8pm to 10pm no discount offered however given it changed from an evening flight to a night flight and I notice that on time performance of this flight is poor to say the least. We shall wait and see.

29 May 2014. Flight ZB547 from ACE. The food cider sausages and cheesy mash with vegetables was delicious. Clean modern plane but the seats wouldn't recline and I was knackered. I only posted because of the food quality.

We booked a holiday to Benidorm with David Urquhart Travel. I specifically booked a flight which was supposed to be leaving Manchester Airport at 2pm on 11th May 2014. A few days before we were due to fly we received a telephone call to say that the flight had been put to 5.30 pm which we were not very happy about. When we arrived at the airport we were informed at check in that the flight would not be leaving until 7.40 pm. We eventually departed at 8.45 pm 6 hours and 45 minutes after our original time. Most of the other passengers were grumbling and it seemed pretty clear that the original flight of 2pm had been taken off. We finally arrived at our hotel at 2 am local time after setting off from our home at 2 pm the previous day. The seats were so closely packed together that my knees were up against the seat in front we could barely get the trays down in front of us and it was impossible to recline the seats as that would have given no room for the people behind us. To add to this the stewards wheeling the trolleys met right against our seats and were there for about 20 minutes constantly opening the metal doors to get out items and letting the doors bang against our seats.

Leeds Bradford to Heraklion Crete. Plane clean and tidy both out and inbound. Sat on row 30 both ways and legroom atrocious for a 6ft male. Journey took four hours and I felt crippled by the end. I usually fly Jet 2 and their legroom is much better. I do not understand why airlines with such poor legroom have seats that recline this just increases the discomfort of the person behind.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I flew with Monarch many times with no major problems - it is a budget airline so expectations are low. However twice this year I had one of their newly refitted aircraft : the seats are non-reclinable and very hard. I do not usually suffer from back-ache but I had to take a pain killer half away through the flight. For Rome to London a little over 2 hours flight this was bearable although painful. But for a night 5 hours 40 minutes journey from Hurgada (Egypt) to London it is torture. I will not use them again for longer flights.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew ZB7414/15 last month on an Airbus A321 with a newly fitted interior. The seats were so comfy and I've never had so much legroom in a non-extra legroom seat (7A/7F). I always fly Monarch when I can because they're staff are outstanding and the biggest delay I've ever had in my 32 flights with them was 25 minutes due to weather. Love Monarch and would recommend them to anyone. Ignore the bad reviews because I've flown with them 32 times and never experienced anything of the sort.

Flight to Rome 1st May from Birmingham - Flight MON 5408 and returned on Fri 2nd May on Flight MON 5409. Have flown with Monarch many many times and will do so as often as possible in the future. The Cabin Crew are the company's biggest asset - they are very helpful and give 100% service to everyone on board. My latest trip was to Rome - What a great flight. Always on time as was this flight but if not only a few minutes late and this is not always down to the airline. Almost always they make up time during the flight. Food on board always of good quality for the price - Fleet is a little old but understand new planes on order - Looking forward to getting on one of these - All in all a great company to travel with - have been treated like cattle on Easyjet and Ryanair always try to use Monarch whenever possible. Well Done to all at Monarch - Keep up the good work.

Flew from Alicante to Luton return. I fly with Monarch once or twice a year on this route and have for over 5 years. Cannot fault the airline planes are clean comfortable and more or less new. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. About 3 years ago my flight was cancelled due to snow in the UK which is understandable. Monarch dealt with the situation well and put me up in a hotel free of charge for a flight the next morning; brilliant. This is why I fly with Monarch because the likes of Ryanair and easyJet would not have done this to help me.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew Hurghada to Gatwick last night and the overwhelming issue is the lack of information at the airport about a delayed flight. All info boards had the flight as 20.05 but the boarding card has it as an hour later. When our supposed original boarding time came and went the boards then changed to say the flight was delayed. When checking in no one said the inbound flight was going to be delayed. Onboard the pilot advised we were going to be late taking off as air traffic control didn't like their flight plan. All in all we landed 2 hours later then we were scheduled to. Onboard the flight on the A321 were uncomfortable leg room was ok for a 6'5" male but you have to remember space is always going to be at a premium on such airlines. My other issue with these flights is that as they are late evening there are always families travelling with young kids such as we were whereby it will be time for the kids to sleep. Constant announcements about duty free refreshments charity collections rubbish collections etc all add to a difficult sleep for young ones. I appreciate the airlines make a lot of money from selling items in board but a bit of common sense wouldn't go amiss.

My wife and I fly with Monarch as often as possible for the simple reason the flights are usually on time take off and landing both outward and inbound journeys. My wife is disabled and wheelchair bound and nothing is too much trouble for the flight crew who always seem willing to help. The food is of good quality and Monarch never charge the disabled extra fees for extra leg room seats whereas Jet2 charge almost £25 each both journeys. I've never met a friendlier bunch of people.

ZB 496. Stag and Hen party on this flight - the stewardess kept saying they would keep the noise and swearing down they did move the children and families forward they did threaten to call ahead for the police they did say they would not serve anymore alcohol to the stag group they did say that that would take the passports off those me disputing the flight. The singing and swearing continues. The singing and swearing was relentless and the stewardesses continued with they empty threats whist serving the culprits more alcohol. Weak handling by Monarch. Most left the plane tense and desperate to get off.

Monarch is by far the worst airline I have used just back from 2 weeks in Spain over 3 hours late going out due to an aircraft fault it was complete chaos after loading then being coached back to the departure lounge with no Monarch rep to oversee the situation no food or drink offered. On returning home 2days ago I have yet to see my lost luggage.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew BCN-LGW on April 16th departure was on time and arrival slightly early. The aircraft was a 16 year old A321. The cabin seemed a bit old but very tidy nevertheless. Cabin crew did the best they could to help us they seemed very professional. My only complaint is the seat. It was really old and rather uncomfortable although for such a short flight I don't consider this a major inconvenience. They were the cheapest from BCN to London on those dates and I would certainly fly with them again in the future.

Flew from Birmingham on flight ZB 446 on 1st April returning to Birmingham on 8th April on Flight ZB447. I have just returned from my first air travel following a debilitating stroke and cannot praise the crews on both my outbound and inbound flights they made this experience one which I will happily repeat. I would therefore like to say a huge thank you for their excellent customer care and delivering a service which others would benefit from following their example.

Flew back from Tenerife 11/4 initially told of 4 hour delay on checking in this then turned into 6 hours by the time we took off. To compound matters we had to endure a 2 hour wait at Gatwick for our luggage having landed at 1am! Will do our best not to fly Monarch again.

Returned from Sharm El Sheik early hours 4th April should have been evening of 3 April - 5 hours late. Received the usual lies of "yes the plane has left the UK" only to find out it didn't hadn't. Information when available was sketchy at best when it wasn't an outright lie. Whether these issues lie solely with the handling agent or Monarch I am unsure but it's Monarchs reputation that has hit rock bottom with me.

Flight takes off problem still not solved and had to land at Barbados. 2 days more passengers still stranded in Barbados and Monarch don't even have the decency to issue something on their website informing friends and family what is going on! At the time of writing all the passengers are still stranded in Barbados with no idea as to when they are going to get home!

I've just returned from a trip to Goa with Monarch (flight only) I was apprehensive having read all the bad reports but decided to give it a try. I can honestly say I couldn't fault it! No it doesn't compare to Emirates or Qatar - but neither does the price! It does however compare favourably with other charters. Ok it wasn't the latest plane but it was clean and comfortable - the only thing lacking was the back of seat screen but I can live without that. Food was average but again on a par with other charters. The big plus for me (besides the price) was the cabin crew without exception they were friendly professional and helpful - far better than I have experienced with other charters. Check-in went smoothly and both flights were more or less on time. Very happy with my experience and would not hesitate to use them again.

Just had the same experience as a previous correspondent Luton - Tenerife. Paid for extra legroom and asked very specifically about seat location and recline. Outward flight fine A320 with comfortable reclining seat got 90 mins sleep. Return flight on newer A321 unspeakably uncomfortable nasty hard plastic seat with no recline at all. 4 hours of total discomfort. Cabin staff said Monarch have no seat recline on any seats on new planes. Never never again!

Gatwick to Lanzarote. Outbound journey was alright the staff were friendly and professional. Inbound journey firstly our plane was delayed 2.5 hours due to bad weather in Spain earlier in the day. Fair enough you can't help the weather. When we eventually got on the plane it was boiling the air con wasn't working as the back generator had gone. They spent about 30 minutes trying to get both engines to work on just the front generator meanwhile the heat was unbearable. The plane was really shabby and very loud when in flight. You don't get much leg room which is bad for a 4 hour flight. The food and drinks are ridiculously overpriced aswell. Overall it's good for cheap flights but I wouldn't recommend them!

I will never fly with Monarch again we had a 14 hour delay from Gatwick. We lost a precious night of our holiday ruined the first day as we were shattered they didn't provide overnight accommodation so my 5 and 7 year tried to sleep on metal benches in the freezing noisy airport. They didn't even send a member of their own staff to help or give information the staff on the plane were rude and just couldn't care less.

24th Feb flew to Sharm without a hitch. The seating seemed to be the same as all airlines in economy. Unluckily on the second day of my holiday I suffered a heart attack spending the rest of my holiday in hospital. On my return it was a worry that I was healthy enough to travel. Thankfully after a few questions the decision was made to allow me to travel The staff were attentive I was given a seat with extra room and I had a pleasant flight home.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
My daughter was due to fly today 5th March but was delayed in traffic getting to Luton. She did however get to check in just 40 minutes before the flight was due to leave (check in was still manned and open). According to the Monarch website 40 minutes is the minimum time allowed for late boarding she was however refused and had to return home. Last year Monarch left my same daughter stranded in Malaga (the flight was routed the from Gibraltar due to bad weather) the upshot of that was she was left there (during a strike by the Spanish) and I had to pay a small fortune to taxi her into Gibraltar all this in spite of several fruitless calls to monarch during the several hours she was left there. As she visits me in Gibraltar frequently as does my other daughter (who experiences no such issues from easyjet) begs the question do I encourage my daughter to use Gatwick rather than Luton? Never use Monarch unless absolutely no other option is available.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We flew from Birmingham to Sharm on 25th January. Check in was quick and easy. We had booked extra leg room seats and I'm pleased we did because passengers in economy section looked extremely cramped. Flight departed on time and we actually arrived early. Cabin service was good throughout but if you get hungry I would suggest that you avoid the toasted sandwich - it was like chewing on two pieces of burnt cardboard. Return flight on 4th Feb was delayed by about 40 minutes. Service okay and we would probably use Monarch again - but only if we could get extra leg room seats.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Last week I flew from Gatwick to Gambia. I have travelled world-wide in Economy with other airlines for much longer periods of time and although being cramped I have never had a problem. I never recline my seat however this journey was made extremely uncomfortable not by the person in front of me but the woman behind. For the first few hours of the flight she had had her feet digging into my back. An hour before we were due to land she woke up and I heard her tutting and mumbling then quite violently she shoved my seat forward and held it there. I was in a window seat in row 17 and had previously had the full view of my window and a bit of the one behind. Now I had half of my own window which shows how far forward she had rammed my seat. In response she hurled abuse at me saying that I have been squashing her the entire 6.5 hours etc. I was also quite relieved that I had just finished my cup of hot coffee that I was holding only minutes before. This of course is not a fault of the airline. I do however believe that if they want to reduce the space of the seats then they should not have the seats be able to recline or be moved at all. The plane was old and shabby and not ideal for a flight that long. I have been on shorter flights in Monarch planes that looked a lot better than this one. On the return flight I was at the back of the plane and nowhere near the group but as we geared up ready for take off suddenly all the power went out and there were a lot of ashen-faced passengers who were no doubt thinking that had better not happen in the air. We were switched to auxiliary power and told by a very apologetic pilot that it would not happen again. I will not be flying with Monarch again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew back from Funchal airport in Madeira yesterday and boarding was a farce! I watched several planes land from the open air top floor balcony and passengers got off their planes and walked a very short distance to the terminal building. When we went left the terminal building to board to the astonishment of virtually everyone we had to get on a bus to our plane which was parked not an inch more than 30 yards away in front of the terminal building! The flight was ok but the extra legroom seat was very narrow and I am not fat! The food was poor and vastly overpriced the cabin crew were very good and professional and I felt really sorry for them as on top of their normal duties they had to try and hawk uninteresting lottery tickets that nobody wanted and then they had to try to collect for some minor charity again with no interest from the passengers.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Booked our flights to Goa. Checking in was a breeze so a great start boarding the airbus A330 I was pleasantly surprised yes this is classed as a "budget" airline and yes you do get what you pay for but even though we went for the "budget" airline the seats for us were great. The leg room was good and the food was as all airplane food is but still nonetheless was a good meal and the cabin crew were lovely. Return flight was also the same. You do get what you pay for so if your expecting to fly like royalty then choose a different airline but if you are like the average holiday maker and cant afford all those luxury's then this is a great airline to choose.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We have just returned from Goa on the outbound journey we were disappointed not to have received the seats that Flight from Gatwick to Malaga in October. I wasn't expecting luxury but when the lady in front of me reclined her seat immediately after take off my journey became very uncomfortable. This wasn't helped by the seat pitch being very small in the first place and the pocket on the seat being bent and broken and digging into my knees for the whole flight. This was a morning flight so there was no need to recline. I would suggest to Monarch if they insist on packing so many people in and having small seat pitches to follow in the steps of EasyJet and have seats that don't recline as unfortunately it seems that many people can't get to grips with good manners and common decency. Just think would you be happy if somebody did that to you! Easy really. I would use Monarch again but only for a flight of a maximum of 2 to 2.5 hours and only if they were a lot cheaper than the alternatives.

We have just returned from Goa on the outbound journey we were disappointed not to have received the seats that we had asked for on medical grounds as stated on our tickets. When we arrived at the resort at 5.15 am we where told that we could not check in until 11.30am. During our stay we decided to upgrade our return seats to premium class we paid £300 for the pair on arrival at check in they had to search for our names which took up time when we took our seats a cabin crew member told us that because we had booked the premium return seats less than 48hrs before our flight we would not be getting the full premium service i.e. The food would be of a lower standard. We told the crew member that we had actually booked it a week ago every time that we have travelled with Monarch we have had problems. We only booked this time because the hotel we wanted use Monarch. Never again.

Manchester - Goa on A330. We have just returned from Goa and were very disappointed with pretty much everything on the flight the only good things were the Monarch staff at Manchester (check in and help desk) and that the flights actually left on time! But apart from that the seating was cramped the plane was very dated the entertainment very basic and unreliable for an 11 hour flight. The air crew were miserable and more interested in selling you earphones expensive drinks and snacks before providing the inflight meals that were ok on the way there (two in 8 hrs) but totally inadequate on the return journey (one meal in 11hrs). After comparing these to previous flights with other companies we will not be using Monarch again!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Just returned from Tenerife to Luton on 11th Jan and outward flight no problems at all as on A320 with extra leg room and older type seats (cloth) which reclined. Service and comfort fine. However return flight was on a A321 which looked as if it had just been refitted with leather type seats with no recline action and despite again having extra leg room turned out to be the most uncomfortable flight I have been on. Virtually no padding anywhere on the seat arm rest shorter than the norm and seat squab appeared to be shorter as well which added to the discomfort. I wasn't the only one to complain to on board staff and by the response they have had many more! I would say 2 hours is about the limit that one could endure so 4- 5 hours is really a pain in the butt! Flown with Ryanair and Easyjet to same place and they were much better for the comfort factor. Just hope Monarch do not refit all planes with same seats! Apart from this aspect staff and food etc fine and not constantly pestered.

Just got back from Goa. Was ill during flight so 11 hours of torture! Cabin crew were really nice but let down by under-investment in the aircraft. These are really old planes so old fashioned drop down TVs (that kept breaking) and noise levels etc all the norm for older planes. Per comments here seat pitch and width is terrible so restful flight impossible. It wasn't that cheap so no "get what you pay for" nonsense. Overall great crew. Real shame let down by poor planes/flying experience.

Flew to Egypt and back (Sharm el Sheik) December 2013. Return flight delayed by about 2 hrs due to weather problems in Grenoble so travelled much later than anticipated. Seat pitch is appalling I would suggest that it may have safety issues if rapid disembarkation is required and leg room so appalling it invites DVT. Even though the 5.5 hr flight took off some time after 22.00 instead of 20.20 the cabin crew still kept up their incessant sales pitch for inedible food undrinkable wine and 2 for 1 offers for duty free tat throughout the flight making relaxation - what there was of it considering the lack of personal space - even more difficult. The seats were worn out hard and many would not recline.

Flew EMA to Faro 19/12 flight more or less left on time aircraft clean and very presentable cabin crew good with regular updates from the flight deck. Returned on 26th late on departure an air traffic control issue made up time into EMA again cabin crew very smart and attentive even though flight was less then half full. Only problem with this airline is the lack of leg room same as other charter airlines. It was almost acceptable for the flight distance.

Tenerife to Luton on 27 December 2013. The plane was delayed by approximately one hour. I was seated in 17A (allocated) and the space between the front of the seat and the back of 16A was 10.5 inches which is absolutely absurd. I had the most uncomfortable flight ever and considering I fly on average 18-20 times a year and have been doing so for 50 years that is some claim.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I flew on a Monarch plane chartered by Saga in January from Los Angeles to London Gatwick and endured a long delay at LA with no help from anyone regarding food or reasons for delay. Eventually sweltering customers were boarded on just one set of steps for the whole jumbo planeload. The seats were very cramped and the aisles very narrow. I am 5ft 2ins and very slim but had to walk sideways breathing in to pass down the aisles towards the rear of the plane. I could see well built passengers overflowing into the aisles from their seats and also on to the unfortunate person sitting next to them. This is not the service or comfort that Monarch offered a few years ago. The food was sparse and awful but the crew blamed it on Saga. Worse still we had to make an emergency landing at Santiago due to a sick passenger and when airborne again an announcement was made that there would be no hot drinks served as they had run out of hot water. Never heard such an excuse and all we could have were cold drinks. Completely unacceptable and never explained to us. Now worried that Fred Olsen are using Monarch to connect us to a cruise starting from Tenerife on 17th January 2014. Wonder what will be in store for hapless passengers on that flight?

ZB96 14th December 0900 Luton to Sharm el Sheik. So we got onto the airplane as usual nothing special about that after a short time we took off all seemed well until about an hour into the flight to Egypt we were told there was a technical difficulty with the plane and we had to travel another hour back to Luton airport. We were then kept waiting on the airplane at the airport for 2.5 hours waiting for them to fix the problem a large majority of this time was without air conditioning and we were told we cannot leave the plane so all in all we have been sat on this plane for 4.5 hours and we are right back where we started. Worst airline I've ever experienced don't ever use Monarch.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Arrived at airport and saw huge queues for check in. Approached by staff member and asked if we would like extra legroom seats at extra cost of £26.95 each. Said "yes" and were taken straight to a desk reserved for premium flyers and were then told we would get complimentary upgrades coming back. Cabin crew very pleasant and efficient. Monarch if a sort of hybrid airline between low cost and full service models. They have both charter and scheduled operations. 20kg baggage pus 10kg hand luggage included but all food and drinks are paid for as required. Both flights on time and as this was a four and a half hour flight the extra legroom seats were well worth the money. On board they announced spare extra legroom seats for sale at £30 one way so we were doubly pleased.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Manchester to Tenerife 5th December. Flight on time and crew friendly and efficient. Seats could be better in terms of legroom and width for a 4 1/2 hour flight . 10 kg cabin baggage adequate though paying £15 for online check in is a bit steep but maybe worth it to avoid the 30 minute queue at Manchester airport.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Luton to Larnaca. OK as expected. Larnaca to Luton - different aircraft - non reclining seats on 5 hour night flight. Completely crazy? Non-reclining seats may be acceptable for a 1-2 hour flight but a plane load of passengers dying for some sleep many of whom have a long drive when they arrive back in the UK is nuts. Couldn't see that they had got anymore seats onto the plane because of it. If you want to save weight stick to the 10kg cabin bag limit and not let people into the cabin with full size 20kg suitcases.

Got on the plane from Sharm Egypt 28th Nov. Boarding time was 17.25 waited on plane for over 2 hours as there was supposed to be a problem with the air conditioning. Staff didn't offer drinks to people they needed to be asked. The flight then to Birmingham was diverted to Luton we arrived in Luton at 23.15 local time and was told there would be coaches to meet us there at 02.00 the coaches turned up only two of them. There were no Monarch staff there to assist any passengers I finally got home at 05.00 and was suppose to be at work at 07.30. Will never use Monarch again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Luton to Lanzarote. Very good. Pre ordered food and was excellent would do that again. Flights were 125 pounds. I would use them again over Ryanair. Much more straight forward and less in your face. Hardly any legroom at all even worse than easyjet but I'm only 5'9 and it was only a 4 hour flight so for the money I was happy. Extra legroom seats could be worth it but would have put and extra 50 odd pounds on each ticket so we put up with the lack of legroom.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew return flights to Egypt 11/11/13-25/11/13. When checking in asked for extra leg room charge for this was £ £10 per seat well worth it. On the way back from Egypt they wanted £30 per seat same plane etc? Staff were good and friendly disappointed with the return charge for extra leg room as I am over 6 foot the "normal" seating space was very cramped! Another thing was we couldn't check in online which was a bit of a pain.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
My main grudge is with the seating. I am 6ft 3ins and therefore usually when flying economy airlines ask for and pay for extra leg room and usually in advance. I have not flown Monarch for some years now but when I used to fly Monarch I recall a superior charter airline with more seating space and better food and service than other charter airlines. This time (14/11/13 Leeds/Bradford to Lanzarote) booked through Sunseekers I had no opportunity to book extra legroom in advance. Monarchs confirmation to me through Sunseekers advertised extra legroom seats "from £6.99 per single flight". Extra legroom seats were offered to me on the outbound trip for £10 each. On the return trip at the airport I asked for seats with extra legroom and was told the price one way was £31 vastly more than either £10 or £6.99 come to that. Obviously this price was grossly too expensive as the seats were offered on the plane at £20 each still a lot but hugely annoying to anyone who had paid £31 in the terminal. I found both of these prices to be unacceptable as I would have needed two seats. As a result I spent a very unhappy and cramped 4 and 1/4 hours and will not choose Monarch again.

Malaga to Manchester on 19th October. At 6 months pregnant and with a 14 month old toddler I was worried and apprehensive about the flight. My son became distressed during the flight which turned out to be an ear infection and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Staff came to give some support and discussed ways to soothe my son without being condescending and didn't make a scene.

Disgusted with return flight from Cyprus on Sat 21st Oct to Luton. Seats far too cramped. Lady in next aisle complained about lady in front of her who put head rest back. Lady in front was also sitting in extra leg room seat. Her behaviour was awful she had all the leg room but still put her head rest back and got none of the blame. She stormed off down the front of the plane for the rest of the journey and wouldn't let anybody else sit in her seat. None of this would have happened if there had been more leg room in first place. I had back ache for over a week after returning from being wedged in my seat and believe me it felt like torture being stuck in a seat for nearly 5 hour it felt more like 10 hours. I am 5ft 10" and my boyfriend is 6ft 2".

Flew MAN-TFS a few weeks ago. On arrival we were informed of a 5 hour delay and received a mere £5 food voucher that could only be used in selected places-and it just and no more got me a meal deal. We were scheduled to leave at 14.55 and ended up leaving at 20.05 so delayed by over 5 hours. We were then herded onto the plane like cattle and once in the air bombarded every 10 mins with offers of food. The cabin crew were more interested in selling you something than your actual well being. On the return we were late taking off yet again by around half an hour. Be warned no Monarch Airlines flight ever takes off on time so never use them for a connecting flight or when you have to be somewhere prompt. Would certainly not recommend even after a 5 hour display with a distance over 3.500km they refused to cough up and pay compensation. Will certainly avoid Monarch in the future and would never recommend them.

We flew on an Airbus A320 from Birmingham to Heraklion (Crete) on 9th August 2013 and returning on 23rd August 2013. Upon boarding the aircraft Heraklion bound (25 mins late due to the late arrival of the aircraft from Rome) we noticed the horrible fake leather green seats that were pealing. This was not too much of an issue however. The crew were friendly and we landed on time in Heraklion. The flight times both ways were a little inconvenient but certainly a lot better than early morning flights. On the return flight we noticed our Monarch A320 landing 25 mins early from Birmingham much to our surprise. We boarded and were in the air 20 mins early which was great and Landed at BHX a full 40 mins ahead of schedule! Unfortunately this was overshadowed by having to wait 25 mins for a bus to the terminal (which was not the fault of the airline I must stress) but nevertheless a pleasant flight. The only reason I haven't awarded higher is because the flights were a little over-priced. Overall I would recommend Monarch and had the prices not have been so extortionate for next year on the same route we would have flown again. Flying Ryanair instead at £400 cheaper!

We have a home on the Costa Blanca which involves about 5 return trips per year from Liverpool or Manchester to Alicante. Normally using EasyJet we found cheaper flights with Monarch. All was well from Manchester until waiting at Alicante for more than an hour for luggage to appear. Some passengers learned indirectly that the aircraft luggage hatch could not be opened. Nobody told us anything. My wife and family flew back a week earlier than me. We queued for more than an hour at on-line baggage drop. 23 desks were open for hundreds of passengers. No Monarch staff on hand. A lady from Thomson Airlines kept trying to help make some order from chaos but she had her own passengers to attend to. Eventually I left them at security and went off to find the Monarch desk. There is no Monarch presence at Alicante. Their interests are looked after by Iberia. Nobody at Iberia Customer Help Desk. 3 staff at adjoining ticket desk shrugged and said maybe somebody in 1 min or 10 min. Waited 10 min and left. To add insult to injury on return home received text from Monarch to relax 10.30 flight will be leaving on time. This was 11.10. Have not used Monarch for some years. Tried Ryanair once. Never again. EasyJet always spot on. Scores for customer service? EasyJet 10/10. Ryanair 0/10. Monarch -5.

BHX-ACE-BHX Airbus A321. Seats (row 8 outbound and row 7 inbound) were very comfortable and although looking small were quite spacious and the aircraft interior seemed quite new. The 4hr 15mins flight seemed like 2hrs the flight was that good!! I would fly Monarch again!

Flew from East Midlands to Alicante. Staff very attentive plenty of leg room which was great. Food I thought was very good value tried one of their Cheese and Tomato Bloomers on the way out which was very enjoyable so bought the Cheese and Ham one on the way back. Very good experience all round look forward to flying with Monarch again.

Flights 5408 5409 from Birmingham UK to Rome Italy. 1000 miles 2.5 hour flight. Airbus A320-200 both ways. OK but not the best. Queues for check in at Birmingham long but well managed. Quick check in. Planes OK and fairly new seats in good condition and fairly comfortable. Armrests comfy. However no IFE or even a foldup screen to show location. Crew friendly and informative good landings. No circling! But a bit expensive for what service you get at £450 return. Food/drink choice onboard good and menu card in seat folder in front of you reasonable prices for airline food. They don't try and sell you 10000 things. Like Ryanair! Slightly more seat recline wanted perhaps. And a better sweet spot on the seat for when reclining/trying to rest. On way back 30 mins late takeoff due to a/c glitch. So no window blinds open until takeoff!

Leeds Bradford to Rome return. Flew 20th October and returned 27th October. Flight out was on time and very nice A320 which appeared new. Paid for extra seats and well worth the££5 on the day. Crew very pleasant and worked hard. Return on Sunday 27th was on same plane but a horrible journey with bumpy flight all way home and extremely difficult landing at Leeds airport in storm I have to say we could not have been in better hands as Captain kept us informed throughout flight and coped so well with testing conditions. The cabin crew were a gem. They kept everyone calm and their manner was exceptional. An absolute credit to their company.

I have been using Monarch Airlines for me and my family for many years and once again we are waiting for our daughter on yet another delayed flight this is now happening far too often. When can we expect improvements. Does this mean I will have to look at an alternative airline. Of 5 flights so far this year one almost landed on time. Waiting for flight ZB 252.

Our planned trip from Gatwick to Florida for next May has (I understand others as well) already been cancelled due a short-fall in passenger numbers! It is very rare for me to have a holiday let alone fly. I have been told by friends that they have never heard of this situation before seven months before the planned flights. I have been told due to lack of demand but am worried why so far ahead.

Flying from Manchester to Malaga 2 adults and 2 children aged 9 weeks and one 9 years old. We were scheduled to fly at 7.45 we boarded the flight my son was near the window then myself with my 9 week old daughter then my husband we all fastened our seat belts ready for take of when my son smelt burning from under his seat we alerted the cabin crew who said that we needed to remain seated. At this point other passengers became aware of this problem when the plane started to fill with smoke. The cabin crew would not let anyone leave the plane everyone became frantic eventually after about an hour we were allowed to disembark and were taken back to the terminal. Told that due to a leak from the air conditioning unit that had leaked onto the engine this is what had caused the smell and smoke. We flew later at 4 and were given a £5 food voucher. Will not be flying with them again.

From Mallorca to Birmingham row 6. The worst seat ever was like sitting on a plank it felt like the foam was half an inch thick. Have travelled with this airline approx twenty times and seating is getting worse. I will try to avoid using them again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Travelling from Istanbul to London Gatwick last night an inconsiderate passenger fully reclined her seat in to my face her seat was gently pushed up in to the upright position and she was asked to be more considerate. She demanded that the stewardess confirm her right to recline in to my space the stewardess confirmed her right I had to accept this. The reclined seat now obstructed the light from my overhead reading light meaning I could not read comfortably having to hold my book up in to the limited light passing the back of the reclined seat. If the use of reclining seats is to be continued the reading lights will require to be shifted to a position where their beam is not obstructed by reclined seat backs. Is it too much to ask that one can read in comfort during a flight?

Flight ZB751 from Dalaman 7th October. Not much fun being on board with a drunk who had consumed a whole bottle of his own duty free vodka. Stewardess did enquire if he was drinking his own alcohol of course he lied! Was disappointed that they did not contact security ahead of landing and have an official to greet him. I felt very anxious in a confined space Monarch staff were aware of the situation but chose to ignore. As we wanted to distance ourselves from this man this resulted in my leaving my handbag on board I realised once through Passport control. Nobody wanted to help. Trying to actually speak to someone at Monarch is appalling.

Gatwick to Tobago leaving on 2nd October returning the following week. Disappointing check in at Gatwick with unclear and misleading signs. We were told that we were unable to have a window and aisle seat (pre booking was not available) as a section of the Premium Economy cabin had been 'blocked out' and as a result these seats were not free. However with the help of the supervisor this was sorted out and we were given the seats that we had asked for. Once on board the cabin was only one third full so not sure what all the fuss was about. Very impressed with the level of service and helpfulness of the staff through out the complete flight (BA and Virgin could learn a lot from this crew). The food was excellent and drinks were available through out. The seats were a little narrow and the IFE was just OK but considering the cost of the holiday it was fantastic value. Exactly the same crew flew us home and the level of service was equally as good. Based on this flight and despite the problems at check in we would have no hesitation in recommending Monarch.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Absolute minimum of seat space this being less than acceptable I consider it almost tortuous. Flight was a scheduled 3 hours ex Gibraltar being from approx 8pm local arriving UK approx 10pm local. Add 1 hour for baggage customs getting to car etc bringing it round to 11pm. This was followed by a planned 3+ hour drive home. No opportunity to sleep on flight. Continual announcements + Stewardess intrusions regarding: 1) meals + 2) drinks + 3) duty free sales + 4) gift purchase + 5) sales of airline's lottery tickets + 6) airline's favoured charity + 7) collection of unwanted currency. I may not have recalled here some other sales intrusion. Staff were doing their job but in future would rather pay more get food straight away and be left to get the needed sleep in space and comfort.

Outward flight to Spain delayed nearly 2 hours. Return flight delayed 1.5 hrs plus another 25 mins to disembark waiting for walkway to be attached. Consequently missed our last train and not only did we lose our return train fare but also had to pay £95 for a taxi. Never will fly with Monarch again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I travel to Dalaman 3 times a year and mostly end up with Monarch as they come out cheapest. As I am flight only I can check in online and choose my seat for a small fee. Mostly the flights leave on time in my experience and the cabin crew are excellent. I do wish we had in flight entertainment as 4 hours is plenty of time to watch a film or something! Over the last few years I do think the legroom is less I feel £22 each way is too much for extra legroom. The best for legroom is the centre block on a bigger plane when I flew to Egypt. I would not hesitate to recommend Monarch and will continue to fly with them.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We've just returned from MAN to Tenerife flights my other half was shocked at the lack of room and we think that these were the smallest seats and aisles we've ever had/seen in flying! There were a few issues with leg room my other half is 6' 2" tall man and his poor knees were rubbing against the plastic of the chair in front. We had to return early for health reasons and I booked seats over the phone for that day to get back home and insisted that he have an extra leg room seat. Got to the check in and the Spanish lady gave us completely different seats we didn't realize this until we were in the queue to board and looked at our boarding passes. The plus side of this is we complained to the crew on the plane that we paid for an extra leg room seat the ladies were fantastic and gave him a seat up front. The flight was much more comfortable for the 3 of us because my daughter and I had the middle 3 seats to ourselves. I do have to say that the crew on both flights were very pleasant. Would I fly with Monarch again? Possibly but I would know what to expect next time.

We are frequent travellers with Monarch Airlines on the Red eye flight out of B/Ham to Faro of which is not my favourite time of day but I endure it due to what is normally a good service (but was insulted by being on wet leased planes) they now have assured me that will never happen again. So with this assurance we booked again On Tuesday 1st October we boarded a new A320 found our pre-booked seats (Row "7") then left on time only just after the seat belts signs were switch off and our breakfast was served the woman in the seat in front decide to use all the reclining facility to its full extent which gave me very little room in fact her head was only 12" from my face now I pay for the space so she was invading my space when I asked the steward for help in politely asking her to leave the seat in the upright position he immediately took the stance that she has every right to recline her seat she was in an extra leg room seat and no one else reclined. So if you wish to appease all of your fare paying passengers I would make this suggestion that on a short haul flight that for the comfort of all that a policy of no seats should be reclined as its only 3 hours max.

Flew to Corfu August 5. Pleasant and helpful crew. Large section of ceiling trim came lose after very heavy landing. 45 minute delay appx. The return on August 19 was a nightmare. Nine hour delay. Little information from the airline and all of it conflicting including the reason given by the captain once airborne. No apology of course. After some hours at the airport most passengers bussed off like livestock to a dismal meal in a barn of a dining hall at a local resort hotel. Back at the airport to be greeted by further delay they were given pittance tokens for 'dead' sandwich rolls and a soft drink. Once it was obvious the delay was going to be prolonged we cleared off back into town for a proper meal and refreshments at our own expense. Our tour operator stepped in where the airline failed and kept us in touch with developments while we were away from the airport.

After an 8.5 delay on the Gatwick to Faro flight I am now waiting for my return flight already 4 hours delayed with no prospect of my flight any time soon. We actually boarded only to be told that there was yet another technical fault and no part available in Portugal. Customer services have a couldn't care less attitude apparently they are waiting for a part from the UK. I know this is not an isolated incident and is pretty much a weekly event in this route. Lack of investment in an ageing fleet is very apparent. I will never use Monarch again and unless you enjoy sitting for hours on end with no information on your flight I would suggest using another airline. Very poor service.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We flew to Lanzarote for a 10 day holiday and I was concerned about legroom due to having MS and also 3 past DVTs in my worst affected leg. They offered myself and my wife free upgrades to extra legroom seats they made all the difference as I am in constant pain in my legs but being able to move them about and stretch them a bit eases this. We were pulled aside by staff at Manchester airport who saw that I was on crutches and given priority baggage check in which meant I didn't have to stay on my legs too long. We also booked a private transfer from the airport to our accommodation which went seamlessly. When we flew with them last November the legroom in my seat was so tight that I could not move my legs at all as they were jammed against the seat in front (I am 6 ft 3") so I ended up standing at the rear of the plane near the toilets for half an hour. When one of the cabin crew asked me if I was ok I explained the situation and she recognised me as having boarded with walking aids and put me in a seat with extra legroom gave me a litre bottle of water and told me to give her a shout if I needed any more. Although I still find the airports and flights the most difficult aspect of a holiday Monarch did everything within their power to make things easier.

Travelled 21/09/13 Paphos to LGW 0787. The Cabin Crew were excellent the Flight/Landing was smooth all spoilt by most uncomfortable seats I've ever known 4.5 hours flight time leaving Paphos at 23.20 could have done with some sleep at that time of night however despite being 5'4" I found it impossible to get comfortable the seat didn't recline more than half an inch the head restraint was not adjustable (pillows were not provided) leg room was very restricted the food tray was badly angled elbow room was poor luckily I am quite a small guy average build 152lbs. Also the onboard food and drink is overpriced. If I have to fly again I will be putting Monarch at the bottom of my list. FYI I have flown with many different airlines.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew out on a A300 from Manchester to Palma on flight ZB532 and I can honestly say this was the most hassle free and quiet flight I have been on. The flight was full and departed 20 mins late but we arrived on time at Palma thanks to a strong tail wind. The Airbus A300 is a bit dated now but the steward told me that the A300's were being retired from the fleet and being replaced with new A320 and A321 aircraft in the not too distant future. The flight itself was quite fast and no turbulence. The inflight service was excellent the cabin crew were friendly helpful and professional. The inflight snacks where good although a little on the expensive side £4 for a cheese and tomato toastie but you come to expect the high inflight prices with all airlines. I would recommend Monarch and will defiantly be using them for the next trip to Majorca next year.

We flew from Gatwick to Hurgada which was delayed by an hour because of a problem with the navigation equipment which was being looked at while we were sitting on the aircraft hoping it could be repaired. On the return journey half the passengers were returning to Gatwick the rest to Manchester. The flight was delayed 45 mins when we boarded. Then the aircraft had to stop at Paris to refuel. We sat there for an hour before the tanker arrived. On landing 2 hours late the poor Manchester passengers had to take their hand luggage get off the aircraft go through security then re board the same aircraft? We have flown with Monarch twice and both times it hasn't been a pleasant experience.

Well Monarch don't really get good press but I thought flight was fine. I have flown British Airways Qantas AA and Emirates and boy don't you pay for it! At the end of the day the flight came with the holiday deal and the end result was getting to Goa. The seat was fine the pitch was fine the food was good. The entertainment was not the best but was ok. For the price it was really good. A lot of people were moaning saying they'll go via Qatar next time or Delhi but that cost nearly double and is an extra 6-7 hours. All in all flight was fine. People moan too much about things If the legroom isn't good enough cough up and go first class or another airline.

Usual chaos at Manchester airport. Not enough staff for pax volume it gets worse each flight. Checked in online and tried to find end of line for express baggage drop. Three monarch staff walking the crowd who gave conflicting information probably better having two of them actually on check-in desks! At one point five staff just huddled talking to each other. It took 55 mins to bag drop. Flight boarded okay in fact early but nearly fifty mins before we took off again no explanation. So late arriving. Flight itself was fine. Dreading the usual queues at Alicante to check bag in normally an hour plus in line. Their ground service is poor but flights generally okay.

Flew with Monarch for the first time to Sharm on 25/8/13 from Manchester. Arrived at the airport at 08.00 to find that the plane was already delayed due to technical problems and would not fly until 14.00 - given a £5 voucher each. When we arrived at Sharm airport two other planes had landed also which led to arguments pushing shoving and nearly fighting due to no one being there to organise a queue and there only being 3 desks open we were in the airport for 2.5 hrs and with a 4 yr old who was already scared and tired. Will not fly with them again!

We have just returned from Egypt with Monarch. Outbound journey staff etc good two drink rounds but the return trip was a different matter! The extra leg room seats were free by the toilets and I happened to sit in one (as had other people) whilst waiting for the toilet to be free and the airsteward said to me 'that's £35 if you stay there! When I got out of the toilet there were trays on the seats to block them! One drink round on a 6 hr flight ridiculous and the seats are very cramped and uncomfortable!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Paphos to Manchester on 01/09/13. It appears Monarch have introduced more leg room seats at the expense of all other seats. They have moved the other seats closer together for me there was not a problem with leg room but the table hit me on the chest and would go no further down. The tables should be reduced to suit the closer together seats it would have been impossible if we had ordered a meal. As a result I will in future go out of my way to avoid Monarch.

Could not find fault with Monarch in any way the flight was on time both ways cabin was clean cabin staff excellent.

Luton to Corfu on A320 both ways. Outbound flight had a few empty seats which enabled passengers to move around. Legroom was acceptable for a 6 footer like myself. Service was ok and we arrived earlier than planned. The return leg was much better as we were allocated row 6 which had substantially more leg room which was better than long haul leg room I have had with other airlines. I disagree with the leaving on of lights for a night flight to enable the selling of refreshments and duty free especially as there wasn't much demand for it. Arrived back into Luton early which was pleasantly surprising.

Luggage eventually arrived soaking wet and clothes ruined. I've flown regularly all over the world certainly won't fly Monarch again.

Flew to Cyprus Larnaca on 20th August and returned on 4th September to London Luton. Planes were ok very basic and small (one aisle). Cabin crew were pleasant. Drinks and snacks over priced. Flight was smooth. Overall rather good. I would advise everyone to check-in online both ways as the queue to check-in was very long. Much easier to just go to the bag-drop desk. In addition don't bother pre-booking meals unless you like the taste of awful food I would have rather bought a toastie on board instead. Also zero onboard entertainment.

I flew back from Egypt on 18 August 2013. Firstly we wanted to pay for extra leg room as my partner is 6ft 4 so sitting for 5.5 hours cramped is no fun but at the airport they wanted £98 for the two of us - we flatly refused. When on our journey home it took 1.5 hours to get to us with the drinks and snacks trolley and then there was no flat drinks left apart from lemonade and tomato juice. There was no inflight entertainment which even shorter flights offer. By far the worst airline I have flown with.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flying out the crew were surly and seemed more interested in being in charge of passengers than being there to provide a service. They were rude unhelpful and quite sour. Returning we endured a 13 hour delay - it was a nightmare. We were provided with vouchers for food (in the end EUR 30 each) but apart from the initial EUR10 handed over at check-in we had to fight for the second and third meals. It was all day at the airport. 8am check- in and 23.30 departure. There was no forthcoming information and the exasperated Faro agents just advised us not to book Monarch in future as it is always the same: I agree. In the end we were flown home by a Portuguese Airline who after take-off just dimmed the lights and left us to it (ie no service as had been promised by Monarch). We are still waiting for compensation under EU guidelines - they claim exceptional circumstances but it was a technical fault.

Manchester to Chania August 13th 2013. Flight delayed over 9 hours. Meant to depart at 9.15am only to be ready to depart at 18.15. Informed the aircraft had technical problems. Extra legroom seats were extremely narrow and even as a size 12-14 I struggled for comfort. Arrived at our destination well after midnight. Food on board looked and tasted awful and was marked up by 400-500%. Flight was extremely cold. I asked flight crew for adjustment in temperature only to be told to buy a blanket. There was no in-flight entertainment on the short haul flight and in flight magazine was full of advertisements and endorsements. Can't find a single positive aspect of the flight.

Flight to Kos July 25th from Manchester (Small planet airline) through Monarch. Departed nearly 2 hours late apparently due to cleaners being late. Daughter flew out the following week to join us this time delayed 1 hour again due to cleaners being late. I have to say the plane was not very clean melted chocolate remains on seat and table and rubbish on floor. Return flight not much better pulled flight booklet out of seat pocket and remains of chewing gum stuck to my fingers the lady sat next to me sat back in horror exactly the same problem. Not a very pleasant experience. The food and drink service was extremely slow having said that the staff were very friendly and helpful. Travelled with Monarch before and no problem however really need to look at Small Planet as a charter for Monarch.

Due to fly back from Egypt to the UK 8th Aug 2013. Got to the airport informed of a delay after a couple of hours it was announced we would not be flying that night so then confusion set in. Herded back through the airport were there was no Monarch reps our cases were off loaded and lay scattered all around the airport. Herded off to hotels with little or no info on when we were going to fly. After a 17.5 hour delay we eventually took off only to be informed there was no hot food on the flight. My advice do not fly Monarch Airlines the customer service is a disgrace.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Gatwick to Bodrum on a Monarch A321. Check in was fast and staff were helpful enough. Although for a family of 4 to be split up because we 'didn't buy seats online' was a little disappointing. The cabins are fairly old fashioned and the leg room is bad for people with long legs. But the flight went quickly enough and was a good enough flight. Coming home the flight was delayed and no staff was anywhere to be seen. But the inward bound journey was fine and we still got home ok. Would prefer Thomson in the future but for a first time Monarch isn't the worst airline in the world.

Flew Gatwick-Orlando Sanford-Gatwick 27th July - 10th August. Check in was quick and efficient both ways. Cabin was clean seats comfortable and good legroom - food was better than when we flew with Virgin 3 years ago. In flight entertainment was ok in line with the age of the aircraft. Cabin crew good on the way out and excellent on the way back. Both flights on time. Well worth upgrading to Premium Economy. We would use Monarch again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Travelled Manchester to Tenerife South on 26th July returned 10th August. Paid££25 each way for extra legroom in the most uncomfortable seats I have ever had the displeasure to travel in. Due to the trays in the armrests it made the seats excruciatingly narrow and painful to sit in. Had an empty seat next to me so swapped with my wife who was 12 rows back with my son. Son initially sat with her but was told by the cabin crew to move as my son had not paid for the extra legroom. When my wife sat there upset at having to sit on her own the cabin crew made half hearted attempts to strike up a conversation with her. For the flight back I decided to tough it out but ended up twisted in the seat for most of the journey and perched on the front edge of the seat with my knees and head resting on the wall in front of me for the rest. Narrowness of seats not made known at time of booking or I would not have bothered with paying the extra. A300 plane used Hips still hurt 3 days later I appreciate I am of a larger build but then so are most people who want extra legroom and to not be warned about the possible discomfort is very poor customer service.

Flew from Gatwick to Orlando Sanford and return 25th July - 8th August 2013. Upgraded to premium cabin. Very little benefit as compared to other airlines. Faults on seat recline on both journeys. Inflight entertainment and food poor quality and premium baggage labels ignored as bags were not unloaded first as per the claim on their website. Would not fly with Monarch again.

We flew Gatwick to Heraklion (Crete) and the flight was great. Staff were excellent the food was great the plane wasn't the newest but was excellently maintained and was clean and tidy. The only thing I would say is that it would be nice if there was some in flight entertainment but apart from that a great flight!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I flew with Monarch on the 25th for the first time. Flight was supposed to be in the early morning hours from Larnaca to Gatwick. After waiting in a very long queue for a long time we were informed that the flight was cancelled. The next flight was in the evening and so I lost a whole day from my holidays. What a disappointment. It was quite uncomfortable in the plane we were not even offered a soft drink. Not exactly the perfect hospitality! Airhostesses seemed cold in their behaviour don't remember them smiling at all. My ticket was not cheap.

Manchester to Tenerife 16th July 15.05 returning 2nd August 21.05. Staff great no delays outbound landed early same on inbound land 35 mins early. Plane clean and tidy on board staff very cheerful. Have flown with them since XL folded and never had any issues. Would recommend.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
ZB743 Malaga - London Gatwick - delayed 12 hours. Found out a month later this was supposedly due to a landing gear fault on the plane not on the preceding London flight but actually in Tenerife which I can only assume was the intended flight before that. Yet still Monarch did not manage to communicate to anyone before they arrived at the airport that the scheduled flight wouldn't be possible. No staff at the airport to give any information until we waited at the gate at 1am to ask the Captain what was going on and a pittance of compensation to cover food during that time. The 2 separate planes our group was split across were very aged dirty and with the seats falling apart. I will never fly with Monarch again no matter how cheap the ticket price. They need to start replacing their fleet and maintaining what's left. It's a shame because once you are actually on the plane the staff are lovely especially if you are a nervous flyer - they must be tired of having to deal with all the frustrated passengers.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Airbus A300-600R to Corfu and back. Aircraft apparently dates to 1990 but was in pretty good condition although the seat back in front of me was torn. I paid for extra legroom which wasn't too expensive and was definitely worth it as Monarch manage to squeeze 352 into this aircraft apparently. Seat width could have been better but it was slightly squeezed in Row 2 as the seat tray was folded into the arm rest. Staff were efficient and polite which was impressive given there were an awful lot of people to deal with. I should have booked food in advance as you can only buy sandwiches on board. Monarch say you can book a meal up to 24 hours before your flight but not if the flight is part of a package holiday you can't  at least not if it's Saturday or Sunday as the call centre staff pack up on Friday afternoons. Sandwiches were pretty poor and had I not been running late I would have bought something at the airport. No inflight entertainment but on a 2.5 flight that's not a problem for me. All in all a pretty good experience. Punctual and professional and a generous baggage allowance of 20kgs if you needed it. Throw in the classic Airbus A300 which is not seen in Europe anymore at least not in passenger airlines and I was more than satisfied.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
MAN - HRG return - after reading many negative comments it was a nice surprise. Food was reasonably good both flights on time reasonable luggage allowance staff attentive and captain announcements frequent. Aircraft's not new but clean and well maintained Airbus A321. The seats recline only slightly legroom not very generous but I didn't expect the standard of QA or Emirates from this budget airline. No major issues you can book in confidence.

Flew from BHX-TFS in July even though there was a small delay outbound and inbound we still landed practically on time and crew were excellent. There are delays with any airline so I cannot moan about that as it could happen to anyone.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
My husband and I travelled from Faro to Birmingham and the flight was delayed 9.5 hours due to a "technical fault" so they told us with the plane in Manchester. This was on 19th July 2013. My daughter in Solihull was watching the internet and the plane actually left Birmingham not Manchester. We had spent 11 and 3/4 hours in total at the airport. At this moment in time 27th July 2013 my son and his family have been delayed 3 and 1/2 hours so far at Gatwick. Again another Monarch flight to Palma. The kids are 8 and 5. I will think twice before I book a Cosmos holiday again. They use Monarch flights.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I was worried about this airline after reading the reviews but we found the plane travelling from Manchester to Orlando to be very clean and the staff very pleasant. The reviews about the seat pitch had me concerned but I found it no different from Thomas Cook or Thomson the only difference was no seat back TV's. The savings made more than made up for watching TV's from the roof. Drink and food prices are the same as other carriers mentioned. I am a frequent flyer on average a number of times a year and if you want to save money I would have no hesitation using Monarch again to fly to Florida. Quick and efficient check in at both Manchester and Orlando maybe I was just lucky but we definitely had no complaints.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew out from Luton to Majorca on the 13th July. Practically brand new airbus crew very professional on time departing early landing superbly smooth. Only complaint was the seat pitch. One of the tightest we have ever endured. Would have been unbearable for a longer flight.

My wife and I travelled from Gran Canaria to Manchester on July 15th. Flight was 2 hours late with no information on the delay until we boarded the aircraft.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Due to fly from Manchester to Malaga on June 29th 2013 at 07.25. Actually flew on June 30th at 06.30. 23 hour delay! We never once saw a Monarch employee once we had checked our baggage in. Spent 9 hours in Terminal 2 some were moved to a hotel to await an 18.00 flight and then abandoned with no information given at all. After several hours a member of the hotel staff told us our re-arranged 18.00 flight was now cancelled and we would be flying at 02.10 the following morning. That flight was subsequently cancelled and changed to 02.50. Eventually told that they were taking us to two hotels in Manchester and would return at 23.30 to take us to the airport to get our flight. At about 20.30 we received a note under our hotel room door telling us that was also cancelled and we would be collected at 04.00. Handed a letter from Monarch as we boarded the plane informing us that there would be no food or drink on the flight. Sat on the runway for 1.5 hours the captain told us they had lost 9 passengers and their luggage would have to be off loaded. We will never fly with them again.

ZB908 BHX-DLM 19 Junz. Used Monarch for years but not since 2011 must have been the scruffiest plane I've been on seat covers coming undone pull down tray's not level paid for extra leg room only to be told by row 4 abc and def that they had not paid anything extra. Perhaps need to try another carrier. Disappointed.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Palma to Gatwick on ZB229 on 6 July. My mistake! I should have read the reviews first. Seats have been pushed so they can charge extra for "extra leg room". No it is not extra that is what we should all have. The "normal seats" are dangerous I have bruises to prove it! Am only 6ft. Plane A321 past its sell by date tired outdated. Monarch are just trying to make more money and forgetting that it is an Airline first!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew Gatwick - Dalaman return. Overall it was a good and pleasant experience. Gatwick check-in staff very friendly and helpful. Bought extra legroom seats on way out comfortable and roomy we had a row of three to ourselves. Both flights taxied out earlier than scheduled and thus landed earlier too. FAs were friendly chatty and willing to assist. Flight back had last row seats (row of two) and seat able to recline which can't always be said even for scheduled airlines. This flight was full though no issue with storage space and the FAs very efficient and a good laugh. Food and drink OK and not at extortionate prices the duty free very good value with some items even cheaper than the airports. Would have no qualms flying with them again.

We were due to fly home from Malaga at 13.20 on 29th June - our flight was delayed 12 hours and we actually left Malaga at 1.30 am on 30th June. In Malaga we were told the computer was down but the pilot of the aircraft told us the plane on which we should have been on was out of service. Original flight was ZB743.

Travelled direct to Tobago from Gatwick Airport in late June 2013. The check-in service was very prompt with minimum waiting. Service by staff on both journeys (same staff) was excellent. They were very obliging helpful and very courteous. Having travelled on most airlines over the years the premium economy service is excellent value for money. No time delays good food plenty to drink. Great service.

Monarch fight ZB559 Bodrum - Manchester 1st July 2013. My wife and I flew back on this flight after my wife had a bad fall on holiday. The crew were very good and helpful and so were staff at Bodrum airport. Wheelchair assistance was provided without any problems and the crew arranged for wheelchair assistance at Manchester. We were seated in row 3 which had lots of leg room.

Gibraltar to Birmingham 4th July 2013. Flight was the first of 3 flights departing Gibraltar this morning. Advised our flight was cancelled and the incoming flight had been diverted to Malaga. A farcical situation ensued we were boarded onto coaches made to disembark at the border about 3 mins away. had to walk through the border with all our luggage wait for coaches to reappear and began the trek to Malaga Airport at 2pm - already 3 hrs delayed. Arrived at Malagano desk was open no fast track through security. Began the flight home at 17.00 hrs - 6 hrs late. You would think we would have been greeted by concerned staff no the Captain shot out of his cabin threatening to offload a lady who just asked why they didn't fly back to Gibraltar to collect us. We all realise that there are unusual situations which cause major inconvenience but it's the action taken following an issue like this that is remembered - not offered complimentary drinks or food and rude behaviour from Monarch staff.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew from Manchester to Orlando and back the once good service that this airline offered is in my opinion now non existent due to the fact that they now charge extortionate prices for drinks and food at the expense of the customer. The paid meals (2 servings on a 9 hour flight) are awful on these flights. Beware and think before you book this travel with this operator.

ZB715 Larnaca (Cyprus) (LCA) 29 June 2013 22.35 - London Gatwick (LGW) 30 June 2013 01.25. 4 hour delay plus 2 hours waiting for baggage. I will never fly Monarch again. I thought I was saving money with them but for a extra £70 you can fly BA and get a pillow inflight and a real meal. Worst aircraft and service I have seen. I am still waiting for my baggage and have been awake for over 30 hours.

Arrived at Gatwick on 22nd June for flight ZB228 to Palma only to find it delayed we were given the standard letter and two refreshment vouchers. Eventually left at 22.20 versus 17.40. When we arrived it took almost an hour to get our luggage now on the return we arrived at Palma at 19.30 for our 22.20 flight only to find it delayed to 01.50. Given the customary letter and vouchers which were duly used but £6 doesn't even get you a sandwich. There was no rep from Monarch and the Internet was not working at the airport either so apart from some expensive phone calls to rearrange our forward connections we found it a horrible experience and as for the airport itself it was disgusting. Eventually departed at 02.15 the captain gave an explanation for the delay but come on Monarch you can do better.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew from London Gatwick 15th June to Sanford Florida and return trip 29th June. Both times we left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Staff on both flights were pleasant and courteous. We were 2 adults and 2 children sitting in general cattle class seating although not entirely luxurious was tolerable but wish the TVs were a bit bigger so we could have watched the films didn't bother hiring earphones as viewing was just about impossible. Wouldn't hesitate to fly with Monarch again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Return flight from Gibraltar to Birmingham on 30th June (scheduled for 19.40) left Gibraltar more than 2.5 hours LATE due to the late arrival of incoming flight from Manchester. Told this was for 'operational reasons'. On eventually boarding the flight the captain told us the inbound flight had left Manchester on time but had had to land at Birmingham to have a part fitted to the plane that was a requirement for landing at Gibraltar! Surely this must have been known by Monarch as clearly our outbound flight to Gib landed fine on 27th June. The amount of leg room and size of the seats on Monarch is unacceptably poor especially when they allow passengers to recline their seats - making a very small space even smaller on Row 28 and very uncomfortable. Monarch are very 'hot' on selling things up front but seem to be 'unaware' of customer service and satisfaction! One plus point is that you are allowed to take two smaller pieces of hand luggage rather than one larger one - something other budget airlines should consider. Overall I think we may be going back to EasyJet when flying to Gibraltar.

Flew from East Midlands to Lanzarote on A320. Cannot fault the airline or crew excellent flight. Pre booked meals which was some of the best airline food I have had. That impressed booked again to go in November and to Faro next year over the likes of Thomas Cook Jet2 etc.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
This airline is adequate for short trips and it offers convenient routes from my local airport (Birmingham) but those tempted to pay the premium for a seat with extra legroom should be aware that it seems to make a practice of substituting aircraft which have no such seats. In my recent experience it does not apologise for this or even bring it to the attention of passengers. They are left to find out on boarding.

Flew to and from Dalaman from Birmingham on 17 - 24 June. Flight delayed 10 minutes we were waiting on the bus for the last stragglers to appear from the airport to board the flight to Birmingham which was not our fault. When we boarded the plane the stewardess was very rude greeted with an 'alright' not a 'hello how are u today? Rubbish was not collected onboard - had to sit with my tray down with rubbish on it for well over an hour. Leg room wasn't great and I'm not that tall. Would never fly with them again.

Flew to Tenerife on 11 June having paid for extra legroom. We were in a 3x3x3 configuration and there was not enough room width wise. Man next to me quite large and so uncomfortable journey. On return we flew in an Airbus and had two seats together in row 7. Very comfortable with plenty of leg and hip room. Food was good but there was no entertainment apart from the map showing where we were which I like. As usual the flight attendants were very friendly and efficient.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
MON348/349 LGW-SFB-LGW on an Airbus A330. The flight itself was largely OK but wasn't particularly great compared to similar priced offerings from other airlines. The cabin was fairly outdated (still had ashtrays near the toilets) IFE was the old screens-down-the-aisle type with not very much on and the cabin crew seemed largely switched off and uninterested (I mean they got the job done so can't fault them over that but didn't exactly seem like they wanted to be there). However the legroom was superb the flight left and arrived largely on time and and food was very good so can't fault them over that. Overall although I can't exactly recommend them over other similar SFB airlines i.e. Thomson and Thomas Cook I would fly with them again if the price was right.

Travelled with Monarch from Dalaman 18 June 2013 to Leeds Bradford Flight number ZB7535 and vice versa 8 June flight ZB7534. Excellent plane very clean and modern. Staff really good. Well informed.

Return LGW-ACE in June - outbound delayed 2 hours by French ATC strike so not Monarch's fault - return on time.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Return flight ZB 655 Malaga to Manchester 12/06/2013. Flight delayed owing to French strike approximately 2.5 hours on arrival at Manchester after a good flight waited 1.75 hours for baggage there was no explanation of the delay other passengers of different flights collected their baggage without problems as many as 6 flights arriving after our flight were cleared before we were able to collect our baggage. There was nobody about to who we could discuss the problem which seamed to be a lack of supervision resulting in a 4 hour total delay which cannot all be lay at the feet of Monarch but in the circumstances shows a lack of care for customer service.

Flew Manchester - Preveza 2 June and return 9 June. Charter Flight (MON 5642 and 5643) but incredibly expensive as not many flights to this airport that serves mainly Parga and Lefkada in Greece. By the time you add on luggage fee sitting together fee meal fee (if wanted) and upgrade to more legroom fee (if wanted) it is prohibitively expensive - thank heavens Olympic are adding two flights from the UK soon so should bring prices down. Relatively clean and tidy A300 with cheerful FA's. Be warned - the 3-3-3 seating plan meant that seats were very narrow. On the plus side the flights were on time despite only a 2 hour check in window at Preveza - a very rural Greek airport! A far cry from a scheduled Monarch flight to Gibraltar a few years ago that was a real delight.

Gatwick to Sanford 23/05/13. Have flown to Orlando on quite a few occasions with different airlines with nothing to complain about at all. This was our 2nd trip with Monarch booked online with cosmos. By far the cheapest package holiday to Florida on offer giving basically the same deal as their competitors. We did upgrade to premier but still found them to be cheaper than other economy flights. The staff were great they went about their work efficiently and considering they are dealing with around 300 people we would not expect them to walk around with a beaming smile on their faces all the time. Leg room In Premier is plentiful the entertainment is not so good due to the inadequate ear pieces solution - take your own. All in all we would and will fly Monarch again.

Travelled with my father to Barcelona from Birmingham for the Spanish Grand Prix in May. Birmingham airport was a dream with short queues at security and helpful staff. Used the executive lounge to get away from the crowds and would recommend this for some relaxing time before a flight. Boarding on time and the A321 was clean and tidy as it was the first flight of the day. We were in row 1 as we paid for legroom. On the flight out the crew left a lot to be desired. The purser was sour faced and seemed frustrated with the new crew member shadowing her. Service took an eternity to commence and some confusion when I tried to make it easier on change by giving a note plus coins in order to save their pound coins. Ended up with hands full of coins instead of what could have been a note and 2! Flight was quick and smooth with good info from the captain. Return leg left late with not much info in Barcelona airport as to why. Thankfully the cabin crew on the return were much happier and the service was very smooth. I would use Monarch again but only if extra legroom is available.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Booked through Monarch and lead to believe this was the company we was flying with but this was not the case when our paperwork was received. Monarch was not the company they passed over to a company called Small Planet Airline. This was not clear when booked and only apparent when the paperwork was received. We have currently been delayed 18 hrs with no news. Our aircraft arrived but the crew were non existent which is apparently why we are waiting still. No news handled terribly.

My partner and I flew from Manchester to Faro for a 3 night break. The flights both outbound and inbound left on time with no hiccups. Although the Monarch Airbus A300 provided ample legroom the seats were very restricting and with me being on the curvier side were very uncomfortable. The arm rests do not move so for the duration of both flights I felt rather like a sardine! Come on Monarch just one more thing to get right for your budget short haul flights!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew to Faro from Gatwick on first day of school half-term. Had booked extra leg-room seats but the type of plane was changed at the last minute and these were not available. Had pre-booked 6 seats together but we were arbitrarily split up on the new plane. On arrival at the gate the staff decided that no hand luggage with wheels (previously accepted at check-in without comment) could be put on the aircraft and chaos reigned as passengers tried to take out what they needed on the plane and find somewhere else to put it and then queue up again to check them in. We got on the plane at 6am for a scheduled 6.10am departure and then sat on the tarmac until the plane finally took off at 8.25am. Plane was full of children and babies so the delay was not appreciated. No reason given for this delay. The usual platitude announcements were made but even direct questions put to the chief steward showed that he had no idea of the reason for the delay or when we would depart. From ground crew on the plane it would appear to have been due to the incredibly long time it took the engineer to complete his paperwork. None of this should have been necessary but it appears that the change of plane completely blindsided the Monarch Airlines staff who did not foresee and pre-empt the problems that arose as a result.

London Gatwick (LGW) - Freidrichshafen (FDH) - LGW. Inaugural flight to Friedrichshafen for the Winter Season was reasonably priced. Arrive at Gatwick at 4am we were greeted by several Monarch Employees who welcomed us to the check-in desk and gave us our boarding cards itineraries and Monarch goodie bags. Boarding was fairly quick and the crew showed us our seats. Aircraft was 757 which was starting to show its age surprised how comfortable and quiet the flight was only downside was leg room was fairly cramped and tight. Half way though the flight the crew began cabin services with good reasonably priced food and beverages. Flight crew very informative. Upon arrival at Freidrichshafen greeted by Airport managers. Return flight back to Gatwick that same evening was just as good with both crews being excellent in all areas.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Thank goodness we paid for 2 extra legroom seats at££24.99 each Larnaca to Gatwick 4hrs 45mins duration. Plane an old A300 seemed to have extra seats fitted we slid into the narrow 15-16 inches gap between the immovable armrests the seat back was too low to provide any head restraint. We were in row 2 a 3 seater by the window luckily 3rd seat remained vacant. Unable to spread feet more than hip width sitting in aisle seat I was knocked about by anyone and trolleys using the narrow aisle as well as having my feet trodden on. Thinking of the economy normal seats I strolled to the back of the plane and horrified to see not only narrow seats but no leg room either with peoples knees against the seats in front of them the seats to narrow tight to allow to swivel legs into the aisle therefore trapped in a cocoon for 4 3/4 hours. Flying out we had an A330 this had superb seating we had paid for extra legroom but it wasn't necessary as all the seating was of a high standard wonder why they changed the return flight to an A300. I am booked to fly Monarch again to Larnaca next month I wonder what adventure Monarch will provide us with next time.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We paid for extra leg room seats on our last 2 holiday flights with Monarch and never received them. Thomson took over our last flight from Monarch last week and they were selling extra leg room seats at the check-in desk but those of us who had paid for the seats months in advance couldn't have them. 2 weeks before our holiday we received numerous emails from Monarch changing our seating plan and splitting my husband and myself up even though we had paid yet again to be sat together. The funniest is that the seats next to both of us where they had split us up WERE empty. I will never fly with Monarch again and I fly about 6 times a year and mostly to Cyprus.

Leeds/Bradford to Palma 4th May returning 11th May. On flight out to Palma I was unwell and could not have received better attention from the cabin crew. Extra legroom paid for on journey out - loads of room. Not offered for return journey but even so there was sufficient legroom. Both trips were on A320 and plane was clean and looked almost new. Both flights left and arrived on time. I would definitely fly with Monarch again.

MAN-Malaga 5th May return 10th May. Flew out on a wet leased 747 from Spanish airline as Monarchs own plane was in for maintenance. Quite a novel experience for a 2 half hour flight! Crew all spoke very good English and plane seemed fairly new compared some other Monarch planes. Got free hot drinks biscuits and bottle of water. Return journey was on Monarch 321 which was quite good leg space and plenty of drinks snacks and duty free runs from a pleasant crew with captain giving information out. Both flights were on time and staff at both airports were very accommodating. Would definitely fly with them again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
This was the worst flight I have ever had to endure. I was aboard a very old Monarch Airbus A300. The seat pitch is given as 28-29" the width 17.5". I had the heaviest guy on the plane sitting in front of me thus reducing the pitch even further. I could only sit diagonally and only then as my wife was next to me. After a 4 hour flight from Tenerife South to GTW was I glad to get off that plane! I originally booked a seat with plenty of leg room but the plane was changed. The flight time was also postponed meaning we had to overnight in a hotel as we were too late to catch the last train. Do not fly with them.

We travelled to Birmingham to Malaga return on an A321.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Baggage= Just to confirm what Monarch's Website can't seem to say properly and is a bug bare to complaints with customer services. When you purchase hold baggage it entitles you to 20 kg case in hold. This then shows up on the itinerary over the top of your 10 kg cabin baggage. It then becomes confusing and cost me £2.00 in a call to ask for clarification 3rd May 2013. Email question/answering were running 3 days behind. Not good. So even though it does not say I am entitled to take with me 30 kg overall. 20 kg=hold 10 kg=cabin

Travelled with Monarch to Tobago. Both flights were enjoyable with decent food and good service from pleasant cabin crew. The aircraft was not full so we had three seats between two.

Flight from LGW to Funchal on 13/3/13. Though supposedly a direct flight they decided to go via Faro to drop off some crew members. Hour and a half delay for approach into Funchal meant weather had closed in and we had to divert to Tenerife. Sat on the ground at Tenerife for an hour and then took off again for Funchal where we eventually landed 8 hrs after take off from LGW. Was only offered 1 complimentary drink after 7.5 hrs but no food! We were not allowed off the plane at either non scheduled en-route stop 8 hrs in their seats is purgatory. Not an impressive performance for a "scheduled flight".

Flew from Goa to Manchester. I am 5'10'' and with my back right against the seat back my knees were touching the back of the seat in front. It was 11.5 hours of torture including 1.5 hours on the ground at Larnaca airport for a refuel. No drinks were provided except a cup of tea with the 'meal'. Passengers who had paid extra for 'premium' seats at the front were shocked to find they had the same seats as us in cattle class but with a little extra legroom. The captain did apologise for this saying that they had to use a plane that was not normally used for long haul. Never again although to be fair the cabin crew were pretty good and made the best of a bad job.

Manchester to Hurghada 15/3/13. 90 min delay. Return 22/3/13 diverted to Rome as aircraft could not cope with the (easterly) tail wind without re-fuelling. More likely to have a crew change for operational needs. Very unsympathetic crew as the misery of the travellers was not a consideration for the cabin staff. No offer of complimentary beverages when re-boarding at Rome. No flight info relayed via Manchester Arrivals site. 2 other departures from Hurghada Thomas Cook and Thomson departed at the same time to Manchester and landed without any undue delay despite the wind and the sleet.

My son had a 2pm flight from Leeds airport to Cyprus on Sunday 24th March. He was in the airport from 12pm until 10pm - they finally cancelled the flight after having people sat there with no food or refreshment. After they decided to cancel the flight due to bad weather no Monarch rep was there so no one had any idea of what to do. All they offered on their website was a refund. What good is a refund if you book a flight 3 months ago for £150 and now to get another flight with any airline you need £600! No offer to help you find another flight - very disappointed.

Booked flight from Manchester to Sharm El Sheihk. Flight times were good 10 out and 22.20 return. This booking for September 2013 was made before Christmas and fully paid up. Now I'm told flight times have changed they have been put back 3 hours 55 minutes meaning the flight lands in Manchester at 02.20. I then have to get out of the airport make way to my car then drive over 100 miles. Guess I'll be home somewhere between 05.00 and 06.00. If I had known this at time of booking I would not have booked the flight. There is no way out of this mess as Monarch have kept the time delay down to less than 5 hours. Last time with this airline.

A320 Grenoble-London. The most cramped conditions I have ever travelled in. Even for a short flight a totally unacceptable seat pitch with no room whatsoever to move. The seat itself was hard and unforgiving with no neck support. Unlike other 'charter' airlines who have been improving their on-board seating Monarch clearly have no interest at all in their customer's comfort. Avoid this airline at all costs.

Flew Birmingham to Alicante return on Airbus 321s. Flights were on time. Leg room limited but tolerable on flights lasting about 2.5 hours. Generous hand luggage allowance of 10Kg but this caused a problem with boarding on the return journey as the overhead bins were full to overflowing and passengers struggled to find space to store their luggage. Even booking relatively early I would not class the fares as 'budget' for the length of flight.

On 16 March 2013 I flew from Sharm-el-Sheikh to Manchester in an Airbus 321 which had insufficient fuel capacity to fly against headwinds and had to divert to Venice to refuel where (apparently coincidentally) there was a relief crew to take over the aircraft which solved the crew-duty problem. Several other Monarch cabin staff who needed a lift home also boarded here. We were told after push-back that the flight was unexpectedly diverting to Venice to refuel. And yet there was a relief crew waiting? I suspect that Monarch was less than honest with us. I believe that the diversion was pre-planned because the range of the A321 in headwinds is insufficient for this flight. Monarch is clearly a budget airline emphasised by the shabby interior of our A321. I am not able to recommend flying with this airline.

Aircraft was an Airbus A321. Outbound to Lanzarote on Thursday 28 Feb in Seats 20 A&B returned to Luton Thurs 7 Mar seats 14 A&B. The seat pitch out and back was so bad I could not fully lower my tray also it was impossible to adopt the brace position for emergency landing if so required. For a 4 hour flight it would be very desirable to have inflight entertainment refitted?

Birmingham to Fuertventura. Plane left on time 8.15am and arrived on time. Birmingham airport is well organised and checking in was simple and quick. The planes are short on leg room and not the most comfortable for a 4 hour flight. The service on board was efficient and the cabin staff were friendly. The problem was at the destination. We had booked for transfers to our hotel and we had to wait over 2 hours for the bus. We contacted the Cosmos Rep and also the people in the airport who were organising the transfers. They smiled and said it will be here in a minute. It would have been cheaper and quicker to have caught the local public service bus.

Flew from Luton to Rome. Monarch was a poor experience even by the acceptable standards by a budget airline. From the moment we checked in and the lady behind the desk didn't even give us a baggage ticket and had to be asked to give us one the experience was poor. After passing through airport security at Luton which took an eternity (not Monarch's fault) we arrived at the gate. the plane was cramped and had a distinct lack of leg room the least I've had on any flight. The seats were an uncomfortable plastic! The staff were disinterested in helping and they never seemed to smile! All in all a very poor experience.

Had the worst flights of my life with Monarch to and from Sharm El Sheikh. Appalled at lack of space - proverbial cattle class being the best description. I am 6 ft and found 5 hrs of cramped flying a nightmare - goodness knows how anyone bigger than me would cope. Return journey was made even worse by 2 hour delay at Sharm hence landing Gatwick 01h10 and then having to endure 2 hour wait for baggage. Monarch use Swissport baggage services and on this evidence they are substandard - baggage hall was like something out of the 3rd world and an embarrassment to the UK. Never again!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Monarch's Birmingham to Funchal service was the latest to add to the recent misery of my 50 year flying experience. 40 minutes late departing - no explanation or apology "are we really late" said an attendant when we enquired. The return flight was also delayed by 3 days. The aircraft legroom (A321) was a good feature although the cabin was noisy. The food indifferent.

Travelled from London Gatwick to Grenoble on Sat 23rd February 2013. Original schedule was 12.50 and amended to 13.25. On arrival 4 hours before takeoff to book in we were confronted by long queues and advised technical issue with plane would result in flight being split over 2 planes. 7 hours delay and Pilot stated minor fault which was taking a long time to repair and the plane had to complete 2 other routes before taking us. On return to Grenoble on 2nd March smaller plane supplied with approximately 100 passengers deprived of flight due to overbooked! Additional plane supplied with overall only 20 minute delay over original schedule. Same letter supplied regarding technical issue as the week before. Best guess is 3 flights were under booked so squeezed into 2 flights with large delays. Avoid this airline at all cost.

Flight ZB0627 - Lanzarote-Manchester - 12/2/2013. This is the worst flight I have ever been on can cope with a 2 hour delay but to be informed that there was not enough fuel to return to Manchester due to winds is a worrying prospect. All in all it turned out most unsatisfactory luckily I had pre booked meals but other passengers were no so lucky as food quickly ran out. Also because of security checks at Gatwick any duty free liquid purchases were taken even purchases made on the flight. All in all not very good at all.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Gatwick to Lanzarote. Flights pretty much on time. Extra legroom seats paid for both ways so was comfortable on the way out. Aircraft switch on the way back meant no extra leg room which in reality meant no legroom at all. And no apology or refund either. Ran out of all hot food stewardess says that's because they want to get you pay for it in advance so they don't waste any and maximise their profits. Upon seeing the slop that was served to those who had pre-paid for food was glad to go hungry. Not a cheap flight either at nearly £500 per person. Looking forward to BA starting this route and maybe forcing Monarch to up their game.

Return flight London Gatwick - Tobago flight on time both ways. Price was cheap and so was the 'service'. In-flight meals - 2 served something that was supposed to be breakfast and one that was intended to resemble dinner was more a joke than anything else no complimentary drinks except a cup of tea or coffee after the 'meal' not even water! All drinks had to be purchased. Overhead video screens as inflight entertainment but you had to purchase headset for £2.50 in order to get any sound. The screens were hard to see from our location. A330 that was used had a seat arrangement of 3-3-3 as opposed to the "standard" 2-4-2 on these planes making seats and aisles extremely narrow. By far the worst plane I have taken and sitting in a narrow space partially sideways for 9 hours is not a experience I want to repeat. In Tobago we were rushed into the plane by the crew. Be aware also that allowed hand luggage is a joke with a limit of 5 kg (11 lbs). I was carrying a bag with a laptop + charger and a couple of other items which lead to a slight overweight. The bag was weighed in by staff at Gatwick and was grumpily told to remove some items from the bag to be allowed to carry it on the plane. No constructive solution or suggestion offered. Will not recommend a long flight with Monarch to anyone and unless I have absolutely no other choice I'll stay far away from them in the future.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Two reasons given for a 7 hrs delay. Captain claimed headwinds forced a landing in Gatwick vs Manchester while stewardesses claimed EU flying directives forced an early termination. We took our luggage off the belt at 00.20am and left stranded in Manchester. Needed to book a hotel and Re-book train next day back to Scarborough. Still no official letter or explanation for delay as promised. We lost all our duty free liquids as we had to disembark and re board through a fresh security check. No food for x12hrs and all that was offered was a glass of water. Very shoddy treatment. ZB627 Lanzarote to Manchester flight on 12 Feb 2013.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Gatwick - Grenoble on an Airbus A330 was a very pleasant experience no doubt assisted by the fact that we upgraded to extra leg room seats for a very modest £15. Unfortunately Monarch switched the aircraft for the inbound journey to one of their ageing Airbus A300's and the experience was much less enjoyable. They squeeze 9 seats across (the aircraft is only designed for 8) and somehow cram in approx 350 passengers no doubt aided by the non existent leg room. The seats also only support you up to around the upper back so you cant rest your head at all. Unless you're relatively small or thin you're in for a very uncomfortable flight. There was also an extremely annoying shrill noise which whined constantly both on the ground and in the air. The Cabin crew seemed resigned to the fact that they have their work cut out trying to placate passengers' grievances on these aircraft. It's high time Monarch retired these A300's and replaced them with something newer and more comfortable.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
2hr delay flying to Lanzarote from Manchester due to snow. Can live with that but on return we had a 3 hour delay at Arrecife supposedly due to a mobile being left on the plane in Manchester. When we boarded we were told we'd have to land at Gatwick due to low fuel - strong headwind apparently reducing A321's range. So a further 2.5 hours inside Gatwick before a relief crew - yes the originals had done their shift! Got us to Manchester 11 hours after schedule. In all that time what did they offer us - 1 cup of water - disgraceful.

Flight ZB626/ZB 627 Manchester - Lanzarote return 26/01/2013 - 12/02/2013. Outward flight 2 hours delayed. Return flight 6 hours delayed. Unscheduled stop at Gatwick for extra fuel and change of crew due to the original crew being out of hours. All passengers were forced to leave the plane while these activities took place and were told they must take all their hand luggage including purchases from the plane. Having then been escorted around the Gatwick Terminal for at least half a mile we then had to pass through another full security check and were forced to abandon all liquids including the duty free bottles we had just purchased. I have experienced many Monarch Flights over the years but there has been a marked reduction in the quality and experience. I have been delayed on all 6 of my last 6 flights with some of the most bizarre excuses given. I always have to book extra leg room as I am 6' 5" and cannot get into a standard seat. This is discrimination of tall people when adjacent seats are frequently occupied by small children who have only paid the standard rate!

Just returned from Sharm El Sheikh Feb 7th. Outward journey from Birmingham 31st Jan 9am which included an emergency landing in Athens at 12pm due to a smashed windscreen which was dealt with brilliantly by the pilot and cabin crew unfortunately everything went downhill from there. No communication from any Monarch staff at all we just followed one another round like sheep. Eventually put up in airport hotel and given a very sub standard meal and forced to pay extortionate prices for drinks in the bar. A message appeared on the television screen in our room telling us to be back at the airport for 9.30pm to continue our journey to Sharm forced to change boarding gate twice and finally took off again at 2am 25 hours journey in total. Given a complimentary cup of coffee on the final part of the journey. I have flown with Monarch before but would seriously have to consider another journey with them.

Recently flew Gatwick - Sharm return on Monarch ZB scheduled service on an Airbus A321. From the moment we checked in at Gatwick to the time we arrived back a week later I have to be honest we received great service! All check-in staff and cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. We paid extra to have Meals on board as well as extra legroom - this was definitely worth every penny. The food was delivered fresh and piping hot and the extra legroom was very welcome for a comfortable 5hr + flight. We departed 15 mins late on our outward journey and 45 mins late on the return journey. The pilots expressed their apologies for both delays and kept us well informed throughout the flights. Both aircrafts used for my trip were very clean and tidy. The only gripe I had with my Monarch experience was the seat padding was rather hard on your bottom!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Manchester to Barcelona. The A321 is perfectly acceptable for a 2hr flight such as this. I paid for one of the 34" legroom seats at the front which were quite comfy but the pitch in the cheap seats behind looked very cramped. Certainly a trip to the Red Sea in one of them would be purgatory. Food and drink was reasonably priced and flight on time. Only real complaint was the speed of baggage retrieval at BCN though to be fair this seems to be snail-paced whichever airline you use.

I flew to Goa in premium economy with Monarch I would recommend to pay for the upgrade as it really made our flight that much more comfortable. The meals are of a good quality and you get a choice of main and a free bar. Seats were comfy and leg room was ample the entertainment wasn't quite as good as I thought it would have been. The staff couldn't do enough for you I am a nervous flyer and they were great with me.

End of October 2012 Gatwick to Sharm return a week later. Paid an extra £120 to cover extra legroom for both my wife and myself within the area called premium economy (what a joke!). My legs could not stretch forward enough so was getting cramp seat width was pathetic with old defunct radio controls digging into my thigh. Not enough room even to sit slightly sideways to give respite to constant pain from seat pressure on thighs spent most of both flights sitting on seat arm - not great for the extra paid! Air con was rubbish these are tired old aircraft and Monarch should be ashamed of offering extra legroom seats at a premium price that left me in agony.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Like the review from T Moss - 14 Jan we also used this flight from Hurghada to Manchester on 1st Feb with Monarch using an A321 a plane with the least capability for the distance needed or fuel capacity if headwinds are encountered - why is this allowed to happen. On the outward flight we were seated in cattle class at the back with legroom fit for a dwarf like Mr Moss the cabin crew came round with hot drinks etc without being informed there was a hot meal being provided later luckily we had a hot drink/snack because I could not fold my tray down because of the lack of room. Coming home we booked seats at the front with extra legroom. On arrival at Hurghada airport we were all given a letter telling us we were being diverted to Rome as the plane would encounter very strong headwinds and was incapable of holding enough fuel to get us back to the UK. Had a good flight up to Rome just over 4 hrs with a nice meal on a tray that we were able to fold down with comfort - paying £40 a couple for the extra legroom. Then informed by the captain that once we landed in Rome there was a standby crew that had been flown from Gatwick waiting for us - Monarch must have known well in advance this was going to happen. Less than 30 mins later we all got back on - the new captain then informed us we would have to get off again because there had been a mess up with the amount of fuel. Eventually got home at 3am.

Our flight was due to take off from Sharm el Sheik at 17.25 on 31st January 2013. After 4 hours at the airport we were taken to a hotel that had no access for my wheelchair. They said the delay was due to a cracked windscreen on the plane coming from Birmingham and had made an emergency landing at Athens. The flight took of 24 hours and 50 minutes late we were then told we had to land at Athens for refuelling due to prevailing winds. The air hostess told us their was no food on board as the plane had been on the tarmac at Sharm el Sheik for 24 hours. In an 8 hour flight we were given one cup of tea and one small bottle of water. Landed at Birmingham at midnight. Come on Monarch if the plane was there why did it take nearly 25 hours to start the flight home. The total delay was 27.5 hours. I noticed another review from 22nd January also had a 24 hour delay from Sharm el Sheik.

Booked a return flights to Funchal in December/January to co-ordinate with our 4 week hire dates of an apartment. We booked 6 months in advance and chose Monarch because they were the only airline that flew on a Friday. 3 months later we received an e-mail informing us of a change to the flight time of our return flight. This flight was not changed by hours but 3 days! Offered a refund or an alternative flight on the preceding or following Monday. As there were no other flights from Funchal to Birmingham on a Friday we had no option than to accept a different flight with Monarch that being the cheapest option. Outgoing flight was nearly an hour late with no explanation or apology. On asking the cabin crew I was told "we're not late are we? Leg room was good but service poor. Return flight actually left early and landed early. Leg room good again but service poor. We booked a meal which was average. Tea and coffee were served before you had a chance to even open the cutlery package. We asked for ours to be served later but they retired for their rest time and never returned. They did however oblige when we asked after they eventually returned to sell drinks. Information from the pilot on both flights was poor and could hardly be heard above the noise of the aircraft which seemed particularly bad.

I returned from Barbados after a Saga cruise using Monarch Charter flight back to Gatwick. This was the worst flight I have experienced. Only one check in for 400 people at Barbados plane left one hour late and all boarded at once up one set of steps. Evening meal serves at 10.30pm and no second cups of tea or coffee available. Very cramped seating and aisles so narrow you had to walk sideways. Sudden diversion for emergency landing at Santiago Spain to get medical assistance for sick passenger. Breakfast' served after resumed flight i.e. orange juice sticky bun and one Nutrigrain bar with no tea or coffee due to 'no hot water on board'. Unbelievable! I have had excellent short haul flights with Monarch but will never fly on a charter by them again!

LGW to ACE 29th Dec returned 12th Jan. Generally good service in extra legroom seats. The meals are now excellent and good value. Monarch will have to do something about all the carry on suitcases. I would suggest that they travel for £10 in the hold or £15 in the cabin. If the economy passengers do not like the legroom provided then they should buy extra legroom seats and if the demand increases then no doubt Monarch will increase the number. The bag drop works well at Gatwick and even worked at Lanzarote this time Overall a good service at this busy time of year.

My husband and I flew to Tenerife. We have noticed over the years that the legroom has got less and less but decided to give it another go. What a mistake! The legroom even for me (5 ft 2) was completely unworkable and for my husband at 5 ft 11 was ridiculous. The person in front reclined their seat and my husband had to ask them to put it back up as it meant the dinner tray actually dug into his stomach. I couldn't move my legs during the flight to exercise them. On the return journey we paid over £50 for extra legroom seats which was money well spent although we shouldn't have had to pay this legroom should be of a reasonable amount in every seat. We will never fly Monarch again even for short haul unless it is an absolute emergency.

MCR to Sharm El Sheik on 19 Jan returning 26. Very cramped with poor legroom although not as bad as I had feared. Staff kept busy selling the usual assortment of rubbish at inflated prices. Took sandwich on board which was a good idea. Return flight delayed for half an hour due to snow in MCR but no real complaints. Overall it was bearable though five and a half hours in a sardine can tests the endurance!

We had return flights to Kittila Finland. On the outward journey we one broken toilet from the outset causing queues all down the aisle of the plane. They have the smallest seating and legroom of any airline that we have travelled with. On the returning flight we sadly managed to leave a Kindle on the aircraft. After phoning the airline we duly informed that this was not a problem for the airline but an airport issue. 1 week later and nothing has been handed in.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Birmingham to Minorca for 2 weeks from Sep 26 to Oct 10 2012. When we got onboard we found it quite claustrophobic possibly due to the very high seat backs and the very tight legroom. Outward flight was uneventful pilots gave good information to the passengers. On the return flight we found that Mahon Airport was chaotic and my wife and I were not given seats together notwithstanding the fact that there was an empty seat next to my wife. When a request was made to one of the cabin crew my request to change seats was denied although later in the flight someone else moved to that seat. The member of cabin staff asked if I had had a pleasant flight and apologised when I told her why I had not. We will certainly choose our holidays in future taking care that the carrier is not Monarch.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Manchester - Hurghada MON4328 4/1/13 and MON4329 11/1/13. No airline should be using the A321 for flights longer than 2 hours. It was extremely cramped for a 6 hour flight. The least they could do would be to prevent seats from reclining as space then became impossible. On the way out a seat back broke! Fortunately there was a spare seat don't know what they would have done without that option! Return flight we allegedly ran out of fuel due to strong headwinds! Oddly enough we diverted to Luton and the crew also changed. I have noted on this and other forums this appears to be a regular occurrence with Monarch. The decision should have been made earlier say over Europe and we divert to nearest airport but decision was made over North sea [from what I can gather] so if you cant make Manchester but can make Luton from there then there was clearly no need. We landed at Luton at the same scheduled time we should have landed at Manchester! Finally I was never told if a meal was to be provided they come out and sell you food and drink first without telling you food and drink is also provided then about half an hour later they come round with a hot meal and drinks! Overall a bad bad experience and I will avoid them at all costs!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Monarch is a budget airline: don't expect the world. I think the legroom was tight but for a 2-hour flight to Venice it was bearable. On the plus side we departed on time there and back; boarding was very efficient. I'd use them again for shorter European flights.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
From EMA to TFS. Checking was quick efficient and friendly. We flew having paid £25 each for extra leg room and for a 4.5 hour flight this was money well spent. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful both on the outward and return legs. The flights left on time and the aircraft were comfortable. The biggest downside to Monarch Airlines is there is no in-flight entertainment and that makes a long flight quite boring. Also there is not much choice of food and it has to be paid for. Otherwise I cannot fault Monarch.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
London Gatwick to Funchal Madeira. Check in at Gatwick very fast and staff at each desk courteous and efficient. Aircraft on outbound flight (28/12/12) was an Airbus320 which was very clean bright and the seats were in lovely condition and quite comfortable. No delays on this flight and the cabin crew were professional and courteous. Captain made announcements with regard to the route as and when necessary. The inbound flight to Gatwick (4/1/13) again was an Airbus 320 very clean and bright but it seemed a little older than the aircraft we travelled on for our outbound flight. Cabin crew were equally as courteous and efficient as well as mature as the crew on our outbound flight. Captain made route announcements as and when necessary and there was no turbulence at all. Did not purchase an inflight meal but there were plenty of hot snacks drinks available. We have used Monarch Airlines in the past and have always found the staff to be professional and courteous.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
London Luton to Munich. Firstly Decided not to check-in online prior to the flight as they claim it to be free however when using this option you have to pay an additional charge for a seat. When arriving at the airport I lined up in a huge queue in order to check-in there was only 1 check-in desk open. It took about an hour until I finally was checked-in. I do not recommend this airline as the customer service is rather poor the seat space is tiny and the aircraft didn't seem to be well-maintained because an air vent fell off the ceiling when landing. Compared to other cheap airlines Monarch is by far the worst.

20/12/2012. Manchester-Lanzarote. Due to depart 07.35. Flight crew arrived at 07.10 so no way this flight was going to leave on time. Boarding commenced at 07.30 followed by an announcement telling people to sit down as they had a slot time to meet. Departed 08.05. Airbus 321. Without doubt the worst aircraft I have flown on. The legroom was terrible made worse by the kind person in the seat in front reclining his seat. The safety card shows the emergency brace position. I doubt that a child could adapt the position let alone an adult. So much for inflight safety. The only way to eat the inflight meal was to cut up the food then lift the container up with one hand and use the fork with the other. Returned 27/12/2012 Exactly the same A321 no legroom. Empty seats which the cabin crew refused to let people use. All in all the worst airline and aircraft I have ever flown with.

First time flying Monarch and will not be using them again! The legroom and space between seats is appalling very uncomfortable for a 10 hour flight. They ran out of meals and had to give us the vegetarian option. The televisions were in a position that we could not view them. On flight home it took hours before the food was given out as they took so long with the drinks trolley. One of the toilets blocked and they just locked the door and did nothing about it needless to say there was a constant queue for the toilet that worked and the smell coming from it by the end of the flight was horrific! Would not recommend.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Luton to Alicante return. Why are passengers advised that a flight at Luton is 'ready for boarding' and then made to wait at the gate standing in line for 30 minutes? It is ridiculous and unnecessary. This happens with Easyjet as well as Monarch in my experience. Flight out only two-thirds full and a good service. Return was full and the usual mayhem for those boarding later who had nowhere to put hand luggage - it eventually being taken off to go in the hold ("the hat bins are now full" as the flight attendant quaintly put it). Terrible mess all round and brought about solely as a result of the airline charging for hold baggage (and cramming in as many seats as possible).

Took Monarch flight from Gatwick to Goa and return in Premium Class. Not a bad experience. Flight on time plane reasonable flight good flight attendants variable much better on return flight (09/12/12) than on the outward (24/11/12) when they appeared harried and slightly bad tempered. No wine with the meal was offered and when requested they seemed to think we had a drink problem! Obviously because we had paid extra for premium we expected to have wine with meal. All in all though for the money paid not too bad. Would use them again.

Hadn't used Monarch before and - not likely to again. The food trolley (if not pre-ordered) was very disorganised with lots of calling backwards and forwards and very little food left after just a few rows of seats. On return (late at night) parked up somewhere in the middle of the tarmac at the back of Gatwick Airport and had to walk up some 'back stairs' (easy to get lost) with at least 1/4 mile walk within airport. No explanation! The leg room is poor and the toilet areas very crowded (and unpleasant by end of journey) - sorry Monarch not a good experience.

The letter stated 11am to check in but when we arrived checking in had started at 10 am - therefore my husband and I were not able to sit together. The lady at the customer service desk did not help and just replied that we should have booked our seats in 25 years we had never done this with other companies and the point is that the letter was therefore wrong. On the return journey the plane still had rubbish in it from the previous journey - I will not be using Monarch Airlines again.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Both outbound and return flights from Alicante were late mostly due to boarding procedures and the fact the cabin was jam packed full of "hand luggage" of gigantic size. The cabin crew observed the chaos but did nothing to assist and were so disinterested not even so much as a hello was offered when boarding. Plane had seen better days and was grubby. I did pay to check in luggage and on arrival at Gatwick waited 2 hours for it to turn up. Monarch didn't care and neither did Swissport its baggage handler there was a near riot but no one offered any sensible explanation to passengers waiting let alone offer an apology. I complained in writing to both parties and got no response. Looking at other comments about Monarch I should not be surprised they have turned into a shoddy outfit charging high prices for no service and late departures. Never again BA are operating to Alicante from London now so I will spend my money flying a proper outfit.

Just flown with Monarch outbound from Manchester to Faro on 17th November inbound on 24th. Both flights on time smooth flights even though the weather over the UK was atrocious. Great check-in boarding and onboard service leg room was a bit tight but overall good service.

Just returned from Hurghada on flight MON 4329 23rd November to Manchester. Flight left on time cabin crew did the meal run then followed that with the duty free. They must have worked about 3 hours in total then sat down for the rest of the flight. To make matters worse the captain then informs us about 4.5 hours into the flight that we will have to divert to Ostende in Belgium because we don't have enough fuel (strong head winds). The crew did not even offer a drink of water or liquids to anyone on board. 21st century high tech aircraft yet we cant carry enough fuel for 6 hour flight. Inflight entertainment again non existent so much for brochure publicity.

Manchester to Barcelona 23/11/12. Without doubt the most uncomfortable seats I have ever encountered. The legroom was appalling. Have used Monarch before but they seem to have sacrificed economy legroom to get a few quid off the few prepared to pay for tolerable legroom. Never again.

We travelled with Monarch to Lanzarote and back this week. We got on the plane yesterday afternoon on time but to be told we would be going to Faro for a refuel due to strong headwinds they had encountered on the previous flight. This added an 1.5 hrs onto our flight no real apology from them. Told to take our seat belts off during refuelling why didn't they refuel at Lanzarote? Not enough selected baguettes to go round etc. The crew were tired I overheard one stewardess state she was so tired she couldn't think anymore. When we landed in pouring rain we trailed down the steps and onto the Tarmac and walked to the terminal building. Great welcome home. Never again!

EMA to ACE return. Delayed outbound following bird strike and to be fair delayed less than expected but no communication other than 'further info at 16.00'. Replacement A320 needed retiring as interior was past its 'sell by date'. No problem with return A320 clearly a newer model with greater legroom could actually put knees together whist seated.

Flew LGW-SSH return in November - A300 both ways and both flights on time. Paid for extra legroom which on that aircraft means the front cabin and well worth it. Return leg the aircraft was configured for premium with only 8 abreast and not 9 so wider seats.

ZB216 departure 15.40 from Gatwick to Faro on November 4th. Initially told delayed to 16.10. When we arrived at Gate 38 we were told that the crew both flight and cabin were delayed as some were out of hours and that we were going via Manchester apparently the aircraft was not flying due to some problem with the undercarriage. Finally arrived in Faro 2 hours and 45 minutes late. Have Monarch bitten off more than they can chew with all the extra routes they are starting to serve? During 2012 we have noticed an increase in the number of delays in our flights to and from Faro and our next flight will be our 16th this year.

Lanzarote to Manchester on 6th November. ZB627. No gate until we were nearly due to take off no delayed sign. Then gate was changed twice then changed over of cabin crew finely boarded plane then told to disembark. Plane needed to fly to London. We were told to return to the terminal. Approx two hour delay with very limited information. Finely arrived in Manchester no ground staff therefore could not open the doors then no bag handlers so another delay. I felt sorry for my young Grandchildren. It was an awful experience.

November 8th flew London Luton to Tenerife. Plane 2 hours 20 minutes late leaving on our return flight we were on time. Apart from this no other problems staff were all polite and friendly.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Delayed 10.5 hours on 1st November 07.00 flight from Gatwick to Lanzarote. Ground staff gave what looked like a standard letter with standard excuse for 'operational' delay. Given two £5 refreshment vouchers (two passengers travelling) and provided a 'brunch'. Apologies were scant and neither ground crew or air crew acknowledged extent of delay and severe inconvenience caused. Posting on this site may alert others to the atrocious service offered by Monarch.

Flight back from Dalaman to Gatwick after a 2 hour delay on 5th November after supplying food to passengers either end of the plane we where told there was no food left for us and the remaining centre seats. Tempers flew and a man was given some fruit for his children. A while after going to the toilet at the rear of the plane I looked behind the curtain to find the cabin staff all eating. This is the 2nd time this year this has happened.

Flight out of Gatwick 2nd Nov 2012 for Tenerife (S) due to leave 09.50. Baggage check in - clearly no hurry Monarch letter handed to us advised flight delayed due to technical problems ETD 14.15. Given £5 each food vouchers. Updates on screens deceiving. On asking for more info at desk advised further delay until 17.00 given more food vouchers £10 each. Finally boarded/departed 17.30-17.45. A very long and exhausting day. Could have booked 17.00 flight on the Saturday and not wasted all day wandering around Gatwick airport thought we were just unlucky (these things happen) we now learn it seems Monarch make habit of keeping people waiting. Return flight from Tenerife - same scenario just different times with slightly shorter delay. (Dep due 14.10 eventually left 19.10 - 12 euros each food vouchers). Rumours circulating at both airports that Monarch have insufficient and unreliable fleet many being put out of service with major faults. Will not use Monarch again as they clearly have no problem taking customers money but repeatedly fail to provide service.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
LGW-ACE. I think Monarch has gone downhill considerably in recent years. They seem eager to join the so called low cost airlines whereas in recent years they have been the best UK charter airline. The aircraft a A321 seemed scruffy and untidy and Airbus seats seem particularly uncomfortable. Cabin crew nice enough but seem unsure of their job. Giggling whilst making announcements unsure of prices etc. Did not have a meal because cost seems too expensive hardly any room to eat it anyway.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flew from Manchester to Preveza and return one week later (actually one week and a day due to long delay). Delayed by 5 hours outbound due to "technical problem" delayed 11 hours 55 minutes return journey due to various reasons but again "technical problem" amongst the excuses. In flight meals OK seat comfort poor cabin crew on return journey unfriendly and snooty. Information about delays non-existent meal vouchers available but provision of food frankly appalling. In short if travelling with Monarch do not expect too much be very patient and think twice.

ZB 655 out of Malaga 4th Nov 2012. Departure was to be 12.10. Although I had paid for mobile phone update I was not aware of the delays until reaching the airport and checking in. Originally told departure was estimated as 15.45 advised to check in and were given vouchers for 6 euros. After passing through security the estimated departure was changed to 17.00. Received a text message at approx 11.30 telling us departure was 12.10 on time and hope we enjoyed our holiday! At no time were we contacted by any Monarch representative to explain the problem. Given further vouchers for 12 euros for refreshments. The plane left at 20.45 8.5 hours late. Apart from a half hearted apology from the Captain we were offered nothing in the way of apology.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Manchester to Faro delayed again (07.40 delayed to 18.45) and passengers told it won't be a Monarch plane taking them if indeed the flight does eventually take off! This seems to be happening more and more with Monarch what's going on with this airline please?

### Monarch Airlines customer review
EMA-Malaga and return. Feel cheated that Monarch failed to inform us even at check-in that outward flight would be on a tatty old Small Planet B737. First we knew was when we saw it on the apron. Cabin crew OK but English not good. Return on Monarch A320 much better. Punctual departures on both legs.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
When we arrived at Tenerife airport for our return flight to Gatwick we were told 3.30pm flight delayed until 7.40pm. I checked online and found out the plane coming out to us was not even scheduled to leave Gatwick until at least 5pm so earliest we could leave would be 10pm. Monarch would not comment on this. Flight eventually left Tenerife at 11pm - 7.5 hours late. Fortunately for us we were home in bed by then as on learning of the delay we immediately rebooked 2 standby seats on a Thomas cook flight to Stansted. Our risk to use Monarch again cost us 150 euros for our Thomas cook seats but we have now learnt our lesson and will never fly Monarch again.

Flew into Gatwick from Palma 28th October and was told that due to technical difficulties there would be a 6 hour delay in Palma. The flight went out but it would appear the flight was overbooked and another flight had to provided. Not impressed as when we reached Gatwick there was a further delay as there was no staff to unload the plane then told they could not get the door open. As a result of this my waiting taxi charged me waiting time. From the reviews this seems to be a common occurrence with no respect or regard for peoples time.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Two hour delay going out Gatwick to Lanzarote and the day before we flew home they changed the departure time from 18.00 to 19.55 without informing us. The flight actually took off at 20.20 getting us to Gatwick at 5 past midnight. Seats are tiny - I'm 6 foot so not unusually tall and it was impossible to get my knees in so they kept driving the trolley into my leg. The top of the seat was at the top of my shoulders. It was hot and the staff looked totally miserable. Dreadful experience.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We booked to go East Midlands to Palma. A few days before I had an email to say travelling with Air Italy a small relatively new company. We had the same seats both ways. We were half an hour late leaving. In our seats we noticed repairs sticky tape and ripped armrests. Unfortunately we were on the same plane home - we recognised the sticky tape! My husband's lunch served at 12.30 was the same as the breakfast served on the way out!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Flight from Majorca to Gatwick on 23 October delayed by 7.5 hours. New plane had to be flown out. Seats in new plane even more crammed - both sideways and forwards than before. Nobody seemed to be keeping local staff informed as to whet was happening. Monarch used to be much better. One mark for landing at the right airport.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
This was the first time I had flown on Monarch and felt as if I was travelling in a cattle truck. We had paid to check in our luggage but found that there were people taking cases on board that were equally as big as ours some were taking two pieces and cramming them into the lockers on top of our hand luggage jackets and duty free. The flights on both the outward and return journeys were an hour late. In trying to find space for their luggage they were blocking the aisles making boarding very slow.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Arrived at Gatwick to be told at check in there would be a delay but no further information available was promised that info would be available at 8.10 the original departure time. No further info forthcoming until we chased at the info desk to be told that the flight would be delayed 4 hours (could fly to Palma and back almost in that time) given a £5 voucher and told the carrier was also changed. It really is amazing that Monarch have a business at all. I will never fly Monarch again absolute lack of communication and complete disdain for their customers.

MAN to Sanford return. Check in quick and efficient both ways. Outbound flight on time return delayed 30 minutes. Plenty leg room in economy food outbound good return not so good. Drop down screens not good for small kids as they wont be able to see over seats. Staff excellent would fly with Monarch again.

Birmingham to Malaga on 15.05 15/10/2012. Arrived at check in to be told that a substitute airline would be used which filled us with dread after all the recent bad news concerning Monarch flights from Birmingham this summer. This proved to be true as our flight was delayed for over 4 hours for which we were given £5 food vouchers have you tried to buy a simple meal at an airport for £5. Returning seven days later was an improvement as flight only 1 hour late. Earlier this year had a Monarch flight from Birmingham to Fuertventura moved from Birmingham to Manchester but the return scheduled to return to Birmingham!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Very disappointed to learn that Monarch are now sub letting flights to Small Planet Airways having recently booked with Monarch only to find at the airport that they had switched the flight to Small Planet Airways this is ongoing apparently due to a shortage in planes! I would advise steering away from Monarch as this really is poor practice.

Gatwick to Bodrum October 2012. Paid for extra legroom very quick and comfortable flight - 3hrs 10min. Return flight delayed 75 mins good leg room and we will use them again. No IFE but had my laptop so I was entertained.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
I have flown Monarch for umpteen years 3 times a year and love the ease of using their online booking and check in facility. However I have noticed over the past few years that the seats have become more cramped to the point they are uncomfortable now and also decidedly shabby. Return flight seats are the worst due I think to them adding an extra row in the aircraft. I think this is unreasonable given we are charged for extra leg room. My last flight was only delayed by 50 minutes but despite booking the seats a year in advance they were changed and our party was separated.

LGW-MXP Sep. 10th. A321 aircraft not very new but comfortable. Easy boarding and fast check-in. No food onboard unless paid but the fares are acceptable. It was my first time with ZB and I really enjoyed it and I found the overall service better than BA and U2. It's a pity that they'll discontinue their flight from MXP. I would definitely fly again.

UK to Turkey. Outward delayed 2 hours then delayed further as cabin door would not close meaning arrival at destination near midnight. Seat was awful with metal bar pushing into back. Return flight delayed 2.5 hours arrived UK after midnight and incurred extra parking charges. Seating very cramped and I was bumped into every time one particular steward passed by. Seated away from my partner. In all a nightmarish experience.

Booked flight and seats well in advance East Midlands to Malaga Sept 25th returned Oct 8th and wasn't informed that we were not flying with Monarch - only found out we were flying with Small Planet when boarding. Seats booked online 1A/B as my wife is disabled. We were asked to move by a Serviceair staff member with apologies as we should be able-bodied to use those seats moved to second row E And F. Seat adjuster broken no change when we returned. Looked forward to flying on as Monarch aircraft ended disappointed.

We flew from East Midlands to Alicante on a Small Planet Airlines 737-300 on 11th October 2012. The aircraft was nearly 24 years old and still carried the Norwegian red nose livery. The drop down tables were so worn that when I put my drink down it ended up in my lap as it was at about 20 degrees out of level. The aircraft was very tired and the cabin was somewhat distressed. The toilets had certainly been well used and not that well cared for. The crew and cabin staff were all Lithuanian and struggled to understand what a gin and tonic was. The crew announcements were faint and inaudible. When I book with Monarch I want to fly with Monarch. Not a good experience!

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Sunday 7th October 7 hour delay. Checked in on time 14.00 hrs for 16.30 to Majorca only to be given a sheet of paper informing us of a severe delay (again due to "technical reasons"). Given a meal at SAS Radisson hotel at 18.00 but like a cattle market trying to feed 300 aprox at one sitting. Finally got away just after midnight. My main gripe is this has been going on for weeks now according to various sources so why have Monarch made no attempt to lease in a replacement aircraft. Just unbelievable that they are content to bumble along with constant delays etc to the annoyance of their customers. I will not now book any holiday that involves using a Monarch aircraft.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
My wife and myself returned on a Monarch flight from Rome to Birmingham on 15/10/12 after a 4.5hr delay. Again like previous reviews Monarch used a Slovakian airline using an old 737-400. The reasons given for the delay was first of all they did not have enough fuel so we had to disembark then when we get back on to move about 20 metres and then the fight crew say they have a technical problem i.e. a problem with the steering. So we wait on board for a further 2 hours then are told it was only a minor problem & we can take- off. The only thing we got as an apology was a cup of tea/coffee. This particular flight is always late from Rome perhaps if they delay it they get a cheaper slot or am I being a bit cynical. I have travelled with Monarch many times but that will be the last.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
We had to wake up at 5am only to find that Monarch had had to find another aircraft from Netherlands and there was a 4 hour delay which they had known about days before our flight. No attempt to advise us of this. Our return journey was delayed 5 hours thus not arriving at out hotel room until 2.30am. Thank goodness we were not having to drive. Seats cramped spare economy plus seats but they wanted £40 for anybody to use them. Customer service non-existent.

Birmingham to Rome flight ZB 5409 15th October 2012. A nightmare of trip. Aircraft was Air Explore. Firstly captain decided not enough fuel after sitting for 1 hour in plane - did he not know before? Only occasional communication to passengers. Disembarked and kept in terminal for 1 hour then re-embarked then developed technical fault on taxi. Surely the fault must have been noticed after landing at Rome! Flight landed 5 hours overdue. Plane was very old 737-400 and dirty with broken seats. Captains management of the whole situation was at best extremely poor and worrying. Stewardess's English was poor talked in their own language and dress code left a lot to be desired. Seem not to have any concern for passengers many of whom were extremely concerned about the events. Landed 5 hours late. No effort on flight apart from a free cup of tea and no food apart from snacks which had to be purchased. Why Monarch continue to use Air Explore after all the bad reports and incidents is ludicrous.

Booked well in advance to fly on a Monarch plane to Malaga 10th October I am a nervous flyer and in the past have found Monarch excellent. I was upset to have found out just before boarding we had been transferred to their sub contracted airline but told my return flight was a Monarch plane. The plane was old and cramped a passenger in front adjusted her seat before take off and the arm came off in her hand. The return journey from Malaga was delayed by 4 hours and was again with the sub contracted airline a 6 euro voucher for food given out no information as to the reason for the delay. Watched Ryanair take off like clockwork!

Booked to travel East Midland to Malaga out 7th October 2012 return October 14th 2012. I was advised with to 2 weeks to go that Monarch had substituted the place to Lithuanian Charter plane. The crew advised the plane was well over 25 yrs old. I was on the back row the seats in front were broken so the next row were almost on our lap. I didn't have enough room to eat my food staff tried to move me but the only vacant seats (3) were also broken. Never again. The crew were okay but the plane - I'd rather walk.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Birmingham - Rome on time both ways and courteous service. Replacement airline on way out was Air Express and attentive service from them too (not heard of them?). Would have been even slicker on way back but for passengers getting to gate at the very last minute whilst remaining passengers stuck on the transfer bus for 15 minutes waiting for them. Overall a very good experience for a low price no frills airline.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Gatwick-Tenerife regular flyers. Surly ground staff regular delays and technical hitches resulting in late arrival of the bags at the carousel last minute change of planes resulting in loss of extra legroom seats then having to wait ages for a refund. After the last four return flights all of which have been affected by the above. I am trying Easyjet with whom you can now reserve seats.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Booked flights and paid for premium seats 9 months in advance. On our return journey Monarch changed aircraft and when we checked in we're told that the seats were not available - and the family had to be split up. Children had to be separated. As the other seats available were near the door they could not be on these. My partner was given a tiny emergency seat cramped in. No one apologised. We wrote to Monarch on return but never heard back. Have emailed as well and no response. The only reason why I book Monarch is to get these seats - cost us 200 extra.

Birmingham to Malaga return. Comfortable flights both ways with polite attentive staff. Having read the horror stories about Monarch's sub-contracting to other airlines I contacted them by email and received a reply confirming that we would have a Monarch plane and crew. The return flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours allegedly because fog at Malaga had closed the airport. Whilst it had indeed been misty we heard plenty of aircraft taking off as our hotel was under the flight path. Other airlines didn't seem to be suffering as much. I couldn't find any reference on the Internet to Malaga being closed even searching in Spanish. On return to BHX the luggage took ages as usual but that's not Monarch's fault.

### Monarch Airlines customer review
Disgraceful disregard for passengers who booked flight only from Preveza to Manchester on Sunday 7/10/2012. Delay of just under 12 hours with no information or representative from the airline. Had to rely on Package holiday reps who informed us as to why the flight was delayed when the eventually turned up at the airport having kept their clients in the resorts till necessary. We were left with no answers from an original check in time from 11.30am till eventual take off at 12.55am the following morning. Not the cheapest of flights either given you pay extra for supposed daytime flights. Disgusted.
