### "would fly again and recommend"
No frills, quick, easy, safely and clean flights from Dagestan to Moscow. The airplane was clean, the staff in nice uniforms, professional. They packed us quickly, flew us safely, the baggage was out sooner than I made it to the carousel. Only a glass of water for the whole flight, but it is only 2 hours. Nothing to complain about, would fly again and recommend.

### "flight was rather nice"
Moscow Sheremetyevo to Simferopol. The flight was rather nice, I had a very tight schedule on arrival so the punctuality of the airline was the most crucial feature I expected. Actually the airline managed to do so - the flight departed and arrived on time. Ground staff was very polite and professional, check-in process and security were fast and efficient. However, the cabin crew was unprofessional - I observed that chief stewardess yelled at an elderly and disabled lady because the latter had blocked the aisle: "Didn't you hear me? I asked you to keep your place! .This looked totally unacceptable. Food is not provided, only drinking water. The aircraft is new and tidy, however, the seat pitch is too small, OK for a 2h flight, but not for a longer one. Baggage allowance and seat selection is not included in the basic price, so Nordwind should be treated as a 'semi-low-cost carrier'. However, this time I've experienced an acceptable service level for a reasonable price.
