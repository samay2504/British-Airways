### "just fly and hope for the best"
The direct flight turned into a detour to Nairobi and they changed our 11 row seats to the back of the plane. What is the point of not only choosing seats but choosing a direct flight? The staff have no idea what's happening so hopping onto a flight bound for Nairobi with no indication of that was not the best feeling. It's like they just fly and hope for the best!

### "The worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. 7am departure that eventually happened at 11am. Pilot announces an hour after boarding that there is a technical problem. The communication was dismal. Everyone just sat not knowing what was going on. Other passengers disembarked. It was chaos beyond belief. Finally people started moving and we had to hear from other fellow passengers what was happening as communication was a disaster. We were transferred to another flight where there was no order. When it comes to the flight meal, letâ€™s just agree that the water was the most tolerable

### "Nice staff, water served ad libitum"
Flew Lusaka to Ndola via Solwezi 11 Sept. 22 on an old De Havilland Dash 8 propeller aircraft. The airline has been revoked by financial infusion from Ethiopian and appear to be very reliable according to statistics and my experience. Zambia Airways has only this sole aircraft only but 2 new aircrafts are ordered incl. a B737. Flight on time. Luggage generous, but no space for hand-luggage, it has to go as inscribed (except my laptop). Nice staff, water served ad libitum which was welcomed on a hot day. Noisy, but cosy. Luggage no issues. Price cheaper than the private competitor Proflight Zambia which further have only 15 kg luggage allowance. Homepage excellent, fast and friendly. Recommended.
