### "made me check in a briefcase"
They made me check in a briefcase. But the briefcase could fit onboard the plane because it weighed less than 20 kilos. The worker didn't let me bring the briefcase on board because flybondi airlines wanted to make more money. How damned the flybondi workers are. Me hicieron despachar un maletín. Pero el maletín cabía abordo el avión porque pesaba menos de 20 kilos. La trabajadora no me dejó traer el maletín abordo porque las aerolíneas flybondi querían hacer más dinero. Que malditos que son los trabajadores de flybondi.

### "a decent flight at low cost"
Not Verified |  There was hardly any delay, just 20 minutes. The plane was old,  but reasonably clean. Staff were friendly, I could buy a good sparkling white wine. The flight was safe and uneventful. So bring your own noise cancelling headphone and enjoy a decent flight at low cost.

### "had to sit at the airport all day"
Not Verified |  They canceled our flight and didn't notify us until we had already arrived at the airport. Our flight time was changed from 1455 hrs until 0100 hrs the next morning. 10 hrs later plus the pre arrival time. So we had to sit at the airport all day and wait. Then when we finally got to IGR and to our hotel we only had 2 hrs sleep until our tour picked us up. We had already booked the tour to see Iguazu Falls and couldn't reschedule without losing our money, missing the Falls, and missing our flight back to AEP and then the USA. We were already not trusting FlyBondi. We saw the Falls and walked all day on 2 hrs sleep over 48 hrs and adrenaline.

### "This was the worst airline"
They put us in the seats in front of the emergency door and they had moved them forward several inches. This put my knees tight against the back of the next seat. I could not put them to the side due to the seat mounting. When the seat in front of me reclined I was literally locked in place. They disabled the recline function on my seat so it was locked at a 90⁰ angle. I couldn't even get up to use the toilet. My wife and I travel a lot. This was the worst airline and the worst flight I have ever taken. We will never fly them again.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Not Verified |   I bought tickets during the Travel week, they were promising to give back 60% of the amount paid as voucher for another flight. After one month, I haven't received anything. They don't reply per email and I have been trying for weeks to get in touch with the customer service. They never replied! Worst customer service ever

### "canceled my flight the night before"
This is a totally garbage airline. They canceled my flight the night before, with less than 24-hours notice. I was already checked in online and had my digital boarding pass. Ruined my vacation and I had to find a place to stay while trying to book another flight. I ultimately requested a refund from them and, two months later, still have not received anything.

### "absolute scam of an airline"
This is the absolute worst airline. If you have a carefully planned trip do not fly with Flybondi as they will change your flight times and change which airport you fly to with just a couple of hours notice, making it impossible to make any airb&b that you have already paid for, car reservations etc. We had three flights booked with them and they changed the times and destination airport of every single one of them multiple times. We booked a flight from Jujuy to Buenos Aires then from that same airport with a couple of hours waiting from Buenos Aires to Iguazú. They changed the airport we were landing to another airport and delayed the flight time so it would make it impossible to catch the next flight. When we tried to complain they refused to refund us our ticket or provide transportation and insisted we had to buy another ticket for the evening flight out. Meaning missing all the activities we had planned for that day. Hours before they changed also the next flight and again the other one so they eventually offered a transfer from one airport to another, by this time we had already spent extra 70.000 pesos in between first row seats and private transport to ensure our fast exit. When we finally got to the second flight with the transfer provided our seats had been given to priority passengers without us being informed and they wanted to charge us extra for taking the carry on on the plane even the previous flight despite being told by the personnel at the previous airport that we could take it on. We were allowed to take it with us because we had recorded the staff saying this so their hands were tied (good tip for those traveling. Record your conversations if you are unsure) Then when trying to fly out of Iguazu they changed the airport we were flying into again and change our flight arrival time twice. Resulting in a 5 hour delay meaning we would land at 1am so no one could let us into our airb&b. They are an absolute scam of an airline who are just out to rob you of your money. Never fly with them no matter how good you think the price is and it will end up costing you more money in the long run

### "The planes were filthy"
Local low cost airline from Argentina. Delayed thrice, changed airports 2 hours before departure. All designed to cheat passenger of more money. The planes were filthy. And worst of all: in flight service glasses are made of polystyrene Pay for Aerolíneas, is worth it.
