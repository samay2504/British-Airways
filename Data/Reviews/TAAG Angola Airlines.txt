### "nothing short of a nightmare"
My experience with TAAG Angola Airlines has been nothing short of a nightmare. Not only did they lose my luggage, but their subsequent handling of the situation has been appalling and deeply frustrating. The trouble started when TAAG failed to notify me that they had stopped operating flights between Luanda and Madrid, even though I had a booked ticket. This left me scrambling to book a new flight through Lisbon at my own expense just to continue my journey. To make matters worse, my luggage was lost due to this disruption, and the airline has shown no sense of urgency or accountability in resolving the issue. I flew at the end of July, and it has now been six months without any resolution. Instead, after weeks of silence, I was sent a generic apology email blaming "currency devaluation" for their inability to offer monetary compensation. They proposed a travel voucher worth $396 instead, completely ignoring the fact that the value of my lost belongings far exceeds this amount. This lack of accountability is unacceptable, especially since many of the items in my luggage belonged to other people, and I am now left to compensate them out of my own pocket. I made it clear that I am willing to accept the amount offered, but only in monetary form. Despite this, TAAG has continued to ignore my claim and failed to uphold their responsibility. They eventually sent me a claim form which I submitted two months ago and have followed up twice to check the progress of my refund, yet I have received no response or compensation. TAAG Angola Airlines has demonstrated an utter lack of professionalism, communication, and care for their customers. Their inability to resolve complaints in a timely and satisfactory manner, coupled with their disregard for passenger trust, makes it clear that they are not a reliable airline. I would strongly advise against flying with TAAG Angola Airlines. If they lose your luggage or disrupt your plans, do not expect them to take responsibility or provide a meaningful resolution. This airline does not value its passengers or honor its commitments.

### "no communication from them"
Not Verified |  We were supposed to fly on Thursday at 16:40, but Charlie, my miniature French Poodle, was checked in at 9:00. Our flight was cancelled due to issues with the plane. TAAG handled it well. I was booked into a hotel and flew the next day (Friday). Charlie, however, had to stay behind. He could only fly on Monday, as TAAG doesn't take animals over weekends etc. I had to pay for after-hours pickup and the nights he stayed. I kept in touch the whole weekend. Charlie was checked in on Monday morning. I kept in touch. We were supposed to pick him up in Lisbon at 12:00 on Tuesday. I messaged in the morning to check up on his whereabouts. I was told he was on the plane and that I should speak to the customs agent, which I did. I was told Charlie's vet check is at 10:00, and I will get more information then. Halfway on our way from Lagos to Lisbon, I received a message from the customs agent that Charlie was not in Lisbon. According to the travel agent's tracking, he was in Lisbon, but according to the customs agent, he was not. Charlie was eventually located. He was in Luanda, left behind. The plane had a technical issue and was delayed, Charlie was then forgotten and just not put on the flight. No proper explanation, no informing of the freight agent, pet travelling agent, or customs agent. Charlie was then put on the next flight after numerous calls etc and arrived in Lisbon Tuesday at 8:45 p.m. We were told that we could only pick him up on Wednesday at 12:00. Charlie is 9 months old and very anxious after this ordeal. He is not leaving my side. Besides all the additional and unnecessary expenses due to Taag, no communication from them.

### "passenger cabin has so many defects"
Not Verified |  I was flying to Luanda by TAAG Angola Airlines. When I was going to the gate, I saw the plane which looked like an elderly but friendly Boeing 777-300. I had never flew by Anogla Airlines before, therefore I was full of hope and enthusiasm for a pleasant and relaxing journey. But soon after boarding the plane, the magic of the trip was gone and a mixture of amazement and concern started to raise in my head and the same expression was evident on the faces of passengers around me. Plane inside looked well worn, but I still hoped to watch a movie and rest a bit before arriving in Luanda. Sadly entertainment panels were not working and were damaged, so I thought to myself - not a big deal, I will watch something on my phone, but when I tried to plug cable to USB port to charge it a little, USB port was not working either. I wanted to change my seat to look for a working panel, but it turned out that none of them are working and many of the USB charging ports were simply missing in many seats and there was just a hole in the seats. I tried to stay positive, well I have a book to read so I can read for a while instead, right? Unfortunately the seat lights were not working either and the whole cabin was dark. I tried to deploy the foot rest, but to my surprise, both foot rest pedals were missing too. Since the passenger cabin has so many defects, it surely must have failed some periodic checks, or maybe they were never carried out? I learned later is that TAAG Angola Airline was blacklisted - banned from EU airspace for many years for failing to meet regulatory oversight standards and restrictions were lifted only before covid. It seems to me that decision was premature and perhaps needs to be re-evaluated as clearly this airline is not carrying out basic checks! On the positive note, the cabin crew gave an excellent safety demonstration on the use of life jacket.

### "What a terrible airline"
Not Verified | What a terrible airline! Without informing me, they rebooked me on another flight, which I obviously missed due to the lack of communication. Due to their fault I lost over €1000 in airfare. They do not admit their mistake, nor do they compensate for the lost expenses. When I try to contact them, they give a vague response or ignore my messages. The most unprofessional airline I have ever dealt with! | Wat een verschrikkelijke luchtvaartmaatschappij! Zonder mij te verwittigen hebben ze mij omgeboekt naar een andere vlucht, die ik door het gebrek aan communicatie uiteraard heb gemist. Door hun schuld ben ik meer dan €1000 aan vliegtuigkosten verloren. Hun fout toegeven doen ze niet, de verloren onkosten compenseren evenmin. Wanneer ik met hen contact probeer op te nemen, geven ze een vaag antwoord of negeren ze mijn berichten. De meest onprofessionele luchtvaartmaatschappij waar ik ooit mee in aanraking ben geweest!

### "didn't refund me anything"
They canceled my round trip flights. The flight to Madrid-Luanda was cancelled, they made us wait a day in Lisbon, when the flight was direct, so we lost 2 days. The return flight was Luanda-Lisbon-Madrid and they canceled it again. For work reasons I had to buy a flight from another company, but first I asked them if it was possible and they said "yes, there are no problem, if you cancel it before the departure we give you the money", but that was a lie, they didn't refund me anything because I don't have the ticket, how can i have it? if I had canceled it before, in fact i wasn`t even there, and they deleted my reservation so i no longer exist for them and there is no refund.. Never fly with this company if you don't want them to ruin your trip.

### “my experience was disastrous”
Save yourself the headache and avoid this airline at all costs unless you're okay with arriving a day or two late. The tickets may seem cheaper, but you'll pay in frustration, delays, and a possible detour into madness. I'm not usually one to leave reviews, but my experience with TAAG Angola Airlines was so disastrous that I felt compelled to warn others. My family and I were travelling from South Africa to Lisbon via Luanda, and what should have been a straightforward journey turned into a nightmare. The "Technical": We sat at the gate with no sign of the plane. Right at the time we were supposed to board, staff arrived to announce there was "A Technical. Yes, just "A Technical. Passengers asked, "A technical what? but the answer remained the same. It was like speaking to a malfunctioning robot; it felt as if this gentleman was experiencing a "Technical" himself. Instead of providing flight information, they handed out meal vouchers, completely disregarding our concerns and questions about the delay. Waiting and More Waiting: After three hours, the staff reappeared—not to update us but to order food for themselves. When I approached one staff member, he casually informed me that the flight was cancelled due to "Crew Rest," replacing the earlier excuse of a "Technical. Without even looking up at me, he remained engrossed in the menu in his hands. The timing seemed suspicious, as I understood the three-hour mark is when airlines are typically required to provide meals for passengers and staff. It felt like the flight was doomed from the start, but they strung us along. Instead of being upfront, cancelling the flight and sending us to a hotel immediately, they made us wait for three hours, ensuring they got their meal compensation before finally sending us to the City Lodge hotel. Finally Flying: We eventually boarded 24 hours late, now with a 5-hour layover in Luanda instead of 3. My seat was stuck in a reclined position, making me explain this to multiple flight attendants as they aggressively instructed me to put my seat up, at takeoff and landing. On top of this, some of our group had broken TVs, adding to the misery. In Conclusion: While TAAG Angola Airlines might offer cheaper tickets, you're likely paying for a high risk of delays, cancellations, and a frustrating experience. When you do eventually fly, it will probably be on an old, rundown plane. However, if you still choose to fly with them, remember if you encounter any issues or deviate from their exact process—including when THEY cancel flights—expect to explain everything multiple times and face an uphill battle with their customer service. I have also since learnt that TAAG has a habit of cancelling half-empty flights at the last minute to reschedule them for the next day, presumably to fill the plane. This experience certainly reinforced that notion. Bottom Line: Spend the extra €100 or €200 for a more reliable airline. Trust me, your sanity is worth it.

### "highly recommend not flying them"
We Travelled to Lisbon with TAAG without much problems on the outbound leg. The Aircraft though was dirty, no soap in the Lavatories, no Inflight entertainment and boarding and disembarking procedures a shambles. The fun started on the Return. We arrived in Luanda on time at 6am and then noticed that our 10:20 departure for Johannesburg had been delayed until 19:30 that night. The Staff were utterly useless and unhelpful. We tried to ask to be put into the Cape Town Flight at 9am and buy our own tickets to JNB from CPT, they had our passports and boarding passes for 2 hours to organise this and still couldn’t get it done. They stated the flight was full which was a lie, there was roughly a 150pax boarding a Boeing 777. Anyway then it took them 3 hours to arrange a Hotel for guests and some got sick from sun standard food and got put up In horrific conditions. The new departure time of 19:30 then came and went and we finally left at 21:00. There was no offer of any help on arrival in JNB after midnight with connecting flights and hotel accommodation etc, it was everyone to themselves! The next day I again flew out of JNB on another Airline and noticed that TAAG again landed after midnight. I would highly recommend not flying them, it’s evident that they can’t keep to a schedule and have no inclination to help. The only flight which seems to be on time is their Lisbon service as this appears to carry people of importance.

### "it is really a nightmare"
I read some bad reviews and thought that it cannot possibly be that bad. But believe me, it is really a nightmare! The flight from Cape Town to Luanda was without any major hiccups except for a very old / rather dirty plane. Our flight from Luanda to Sao Paulo was delayed by 2 hours due to technical problems. When we boarded, the air conditioner on the plane didn’t work and the heat was unbearable. Our take-off was delayed due to numerous passengers having incorrect seats and staff being rude and shouting at them to sit down. Due to the heat, some families with small children or babies were threatening to leave the plane. The pilot must have been told to take off, as the plane started taxiing with people still walking around and overhead bins still open. The flight attendants strapped in and the passengers had to hastily close the bins. The safety demonstration was only given about half hour after take-off! Our return flight was where the real issues began. We were scheduled to fly from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo 12:50 and land at 15:40. Our TAAG flight was then scheduled for 18:15 to Luanda where we would catch our connecting flight to Cape Town. The day before, I received an email informing me that the flight time had changed to 9:00. This was 9 hour earlier than the booked time and 6 hours before our flight from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo landed! I tried on numerous occasions to reschedule our flight via the TAAG contact number in Angola, WhatsApp number and the call centre in Sao Paulo. I really struggled to get them to understand that it would be impossible for us to make this flight. I was assured that we would rebooked the next day and that TAAG would pay for us to stay a night in Sao Paulo as it was their problem. However, I never received confirmation. Whenever I contacted them, I was either assured that the problem was being addressed or told that they have no knowledge of the problem and could not find our original tickets! They would repeatedly drop conversations and we needed to start all over again with a new TAAG representative who had no context of the situation - no continuity or accountability! Whenever a new representative checked the system, there would be no evidence of the previous conversations. We were advised to go to the TAAG office in Sao Paulo airport. Although the sign on the door said it closes at 19:30, the office was locked and no-one was there. I tried calling the number on numerous occasions and got a recording in Portuguese telling me to leave a message – which I did and never received a reply. When I mentioned this on the WhatsApp line, I was told to “come back tomorrow” even though we had nowhere to stay. At this stage I realised that we were stranded in Sao Paulo and I managed to find an airport hotel for us to stay for the night. We continued to try and contact TAAG but it was clear that they were talking in circles and refusing to answer our questions. Despite asking for reference numbers when I called, I was never given one. When we received a message saying that they would not re-issue tickets for “people who missed their check-in”, I realised that their promises would not materialise and that we were stranded in Sao Paulo. I had to purchase tickets on another airline at great expense to get us home. It is now 3 days later and I have still not heard anything from TAAG! A rescheduled ticket was never sent and there was no follow-up of the situation!

### "cancel or delay their flights"
Do not under any circumstances fly this airline. I have wasted close to a hundred hours of my time to no avail, having submitted all requested documentation, after 5 months, still nothing. You may think you're saving money. You're not. They will cancel or delay their flights at the drop of a hat and you'll be left in the dark. I am an African tourism stakeholder and can assure TAAG that their reputation is rapidly deteriorating and will soon be at the point of no return.

### "one of the most painful experiences"
Not Verified |  I just completed a roundtrip from Cape Town to Lagos and back and it was one of the most painful experiences I have ever had travelling. We suffered 1 delay after the next with absolutely no communication from airline personnel even the boards at the airports did not update with latest information. A trip that was supposed to take me 9 hours took me almost 48 hours. At one point it felt as though I would never get home. I honestly would never fly this airline and truly regret not looking at reviews before I bought the tickets. I bought them to reduce layover times but this ended up being a much worse situation.

### "the most harrowing experience"
It may look like you're saving money flying with TAAG but in our experience you end up losing time and money while having the most harrowing experience of your life! I have no doubt they have a few flights with minimal drama but after flying a combined 4 flights with them and being in Angola twice, this was our overall takeaway. The planes are really old. In the worst plane we flew in metal parts were hanging off the seats, they didn't recline at all, the bathroom doors didn't close all the way or lock and only one toilet worked. Other planes we flew in were slightly better but they all were a little worrying and worst-case scenario, really uncomfortable for a long flight with kids. In multiple flights there wasn't air conditioning and we were hot the whole flight. -The staff attention and care just wasn't there. On two long flights we were given a small bread roll and a bruised apple for dinner. There was no toilet paper in one flight and no soap in 3 out of 4 flights. When our kids started vomiting from the turbulence there were no sick bags. No flight attendant spoke any English. - The experience in Angola is rough. The card machines were so old that none of them worked for international cards and we were struggling to buy any food or water (especially difficult considering we weren't fed more than a bread roll and apple in both international flights). No one spoke English and there was no help desk. They overbooked our flight in addition to having 60 people trapped in the airport for 3 days due to cancelled flights. People were panicked to get out of Angola. They kicked our family of 6 with multiple small children off our flight and reluctantly gave us tickets on a later flight to a different city when we continued to ask them to resolve the situation. In fact, they just handed us boarding passes which we accepted and only 5 minutes later did we realize it was to a different city than we were going. We came back to tell them this wasn't where we were going and they just shrugged. They didn't tell us the plan to get us to our final destination, didn't explain what would happen to our luggage, and at one point they just disappeared with our tickets for half an hour without explaining why. Again, no one spoke more than a few words of English and this was very scary and frustrating. The airport is not air conditioned and the bathrooms were terrible. Traveling with sick, exhausted, small children, it felt like a nightmare. Finally, when trying to get on the plane, they left us in a overpacked hot bus for 45 minutes until people started shouting for them to open the doors as there were kids feeling like they were going to pass out. No one really cares and if you don't self-advocate, you will likely end up stranded in Angola. If not for another airline in another country taking pity on us after hearing our story, I don't know how we would have gotten home. TAAG certainly didn't ensure we arrived home and seems to have no concern making sure it happens on the dates booked. If you have time for a multiple-day harrowing adventure filled with uncertainty and likely the costs of unexpected accommodation, new flights, and food where you can find it, go for it. Otherwise, save yourself the trouble. Taag has no guarantee they they will fly you where you're going. Pay slightly more for a reliable airline with basic service. This is just too dicey and entirely too exhausting.

### "the worst experience with TAAG"
I had the worst experience with TAAG. Our flight was delayed by 10 hours. There was no information given to us. We were forced to stay there without food or water for hours! We lost our bookings to travel further when we arrived at Johannesburg. They are very rude. Damage to bag and very bad attitude received from their staff.

### "worst airline I have ever come across"
I had been warned against flying TAAG a few times by a diverse range of people back home in South Africa, however, since there was an evening flight to Luanda and I had to be there for work, I thought how bad could it possibly be? Its a 3 hour flight. How awfully wrong could I be? That too, awfully wrong while sitting in the WORST business class seat I have probably ever witnessed. We started off this journey with a 2 and a half hour delay on the ground followed by a one hour delay while sitting in the aircraft, by the time we left Johannesburg, we had accepted our fate & knew that we would only be seeing Luanda around midnight; no explanation provided by the crew other than the brief message that we have to take on more fuel? We got off the ground & the business class service commenced; and this is where all hell breaks loose - 12 passengers in business class and they cater one bottle of Sparkling Wine, one bottle of Red Wine and one bottle of white wine with no ice available - they blaze through the food service & hand out a tray with fruit that stinks of expiry, a sandwich with watery lettuce & a packet of cashews - that's your business class. No refills, very little understanding of customer service & absolutely no interest in representing the business class product. The business class seat had aged and had crease marks all over the pleather cover with the recline function being limited to 3' - the actual recline must have been around 6', however, the seat has aged over time and it is most certainly broken. On top of that, there is no IFE onboard this 737-700 and you cannot keep your iPad on the tray because the tray is broken. The cabin crew consisted of two flight attendants dedicated to business class; neither of them could possibly care about anything - they drew the curtain after the meal service, heated up their meals & chilled for an hour & 45mins before top of descent - zero interest. We land in Luanda,  eventually get to the customs & immigration hall 4 hours and 15 mins after our scheduled landing time - again, the crew say nothing - they are just like cheers, happens here all the time. This is by far the worst airline I have ever come across and I will never fly with them again - I can't help but feel sorry for those who have to fly this shambolic airline to Lisbon, Sao Paulo, Madrid, Porto etc. - utter garbage honestly.

### "Transiting in Luanda is a challenge"
The seats are filthy dirty, many are broken. The inflight entertainment system did not work, I saw no safety demonstration given on board. The overhead luggage compartment opened during the flight. The food was shocking. The air hostesses were rude and unfriendly to me and the USB ports don't work either. Transiting in Luanda is a challenge on it's own. It takes hours, staff are incompetent. It may look like a cheap option and at this point the fastest way to get to Brazil as there are no direct flights but believe me rather pay the additional cost than subject yourselves to TAAG.

### "I was left stranded"
I booked a ticket from South Africa going to the UK and I was supposed to travel on the 31 August 2023 from OR Tambo but the flight was canceled without any prior notice or communication. I was left stranded even till now still in Transit. I was told to book another airline and I will be reimbursed but I do not have money. I requested a refund but they were not able to refund me. They failed to put me on the next available TAAG flights because they couldn't afford to put me on the business class. Please I can't stay any more nights at the transit. I have spent 3 nights already.

### "Totally awful approach"
Difficult to believe this awful airline is a government flagman airline of the country. Totally awful approach, they let they security mistreat their passenger. They stop passengers and create problems with documents where they do not exists. In my case they found an issue with my valid passport - in the beginning was too clear that they searching a ground to get money from me (not only from me, some people were also mistreated by the same way). By the end of the day they have torn my passport and stated I have done by my own. They just constantly say wait without an explanation what is wrong. Unfortunately I couldn't see their onboard service because they did not even let me approach to a check-in counter.

### "still at the airport - 27 hours later"
Not Verified | I had a trip to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil from Cape Town via TAAG airlines on 23 July 2023. The way going was okay - uneventful really with the exception of the mediocre food and lack of inflight service. HOWEVER, I felt that I could deal with that. My TRAUMA was upon return...with a three hour layover in Angola - and where I still did not get onto the flight to Cape Town, despite me trying to explain the small and fixable glitch on my boarding pass (i.e. CALL the South African DHA - its called a V-list - Once the flight representative receives a code - a pass can be printed - as it has happened to me in the past). They spent 3 hours faffing around, being condescending, speaking over me in Portuguese which i could not understand - even as i tried to explain the simple process behind getting me a boarding pass for the last 4 hours of an already 26 hour (3 layover trip). CONDESCENDING is an understatement. Every time i spoke, they said they did not speak English, and showed the least interest in helping. They spoke over me and totally disregarded what was going on. would not keep me informed. PS What I don't get is an international airline and airport that lacks a few international translators or speakers amongst them. Albeit...my story is long and convoluted. It gets worse. I will spare the details. The short of it, is that I am still at the airport - 27 hours later (and three days into my travels), because they have not fixed it...and do not have the humility to apologise and acknowledge their incompetence. Worse - I tried to go out to a hotel for the night as a Southern African who can go visa free (as the flight does not compensate this sort of thing) and they refused. No clothes. No hotel. Patchy WiFi. No apology. I am officially putting this on the record - Do not waste your time with TAAG. I will also ensure that my complaint gets to TAAG executives - absolutely unacceptable

### "delay after delay after delay"
Absolute worst airline ever, delay after delay after delay. 3-times this week on my return trip from Cape Town to Lagos and back, still stuck in Lagos, not flying out. Same thing happened on Monday and I missed a crucial day of business in Lagos. Returning now and booked in bed & breakfast in Cape Town, paid for, not going to be in time and have to fly out from Cape Town to PE, booked, paid and going to loose my flight home.

### "the most horrible experience"
Not Verified |  We were scheduled to fly on Monday 24th July at 8:30pm, on getting to the airport, I realised the flight had been changed to 11:15pm without any prior notice from TAAG. We did not start boarding until 1:00am Tuesday 25th July. After being in the plane for over an hour, we were asked to come down without any proper explanations. It was like they took us on the plane that wasn't working just to stop the passengers from getting more agitated. The plane was full of mosquitos and very hot while we were seated. We came out of the plane and waited until around 3:30 am before we were taken to an hotel. I was traveling with my 2 kids aged 14 & 11 and I can tell you the experience was nothing short of trauma. Imagine being at the airport for over 9 hours? Airline did not even offer water to the children nor any any empathy from the staff on ground. This is the most horrible experience I and my children have had traveling.

### "I am stuck in Luanda still"
They will delay your first flight with 3-hours to give you a taste of what is to come. Then they will delay it with 5-hours, then they will let you board the plane and wait another hour and half on the plane, while not taking off. Then they make you get off again, the last people at the airport, to tell you they have problems, which they do not really divulge to you. They keep on talking nonsense that is not true. Their Lunch pack is a bread roll, an old nartjie and a piece of cake. The aircraft is filthy too. Currently I am stuck in Luanda still, it is now 9am on 25 July 2023.

### "disaster of an airline"
A complete disaster of an airline. Over 1 hour delayed flying out of Johannesburg to Luanda. The return trip was even worse with a 3 hours delay because of a broken plane. Poor communication and it just seems like a disaster waiting to happen! No inflight entertainment, no wifi! And the fleet of planes is from the 80’s if no older.

### "Disappointed with the experience"
Disappointed with the experience. The flight was scheduled to depart Johannesburg at 16:30. An hour later, we were all sitting in the cabin with no communication whatsoever.

### "not worth the money"
Booked flight through GotoGate. TAAG (Air Angola) cancelled flight and offered a refund or change of flight. I was unable to travel on the alternative dates, so requested the refund option. According to GotoGate, TAAG did not process the refund. I waited 5 months. I followed up with TAAG and GotoGate repeatedly, including visiting TAAG's offices. I ended up claiming the money back through my bank. This took a many hours of following up. TAAG blamed GotoGate and GotoGate blamed TAAG. The flight itself was awful. Angola airport is terrible. Very basic facilities, it was very hot in the terminal. The planes were very dirty and old, with no inflight entertainment. I am normally happy with basic travel, but this was not worth the money. Two lessons learnt: 1) Don't fly with TAAG again. 2) Always book directly with the airline

### "doesn't value your time or money"
I recently had the "pleasure" of flying with TAAG, the Angolan airline that makes you wonder if time actually exists. Seriously, their flights are so delayed that you could have time to write a novel or learn a new language while waiting for your plane to finally take off. And don't even get me started on their customer service. When my return flight was delayed by more than 7 hours, I knew I would miss my connecting flight in Luanda. But did TAAG care? Not one bit. They wouldn't refund my ticket even though I didn't even take the flight to Luanda because I knew I would be stranded there without a visa to enter the country. But hey, at least their ticket prices are high enough to make you think you're flying with a premium airline, right? Wrong. In fact, after flying with TAAG even Ryanair would feel like a premium airline. In all seriousness, if you're looking for an airline that doesn't value your time or money, then go ahead and fly with TAAG. Otherwise, save yourself the hassle and choose a different airline for your next trip.

### "It was filthy to the extreme"
I have never seen anything like the plane that we flew from Luanda to Cape Town in. It was filthy to the extreme, the seats were grimy and threadbare and broken, the footrests were broken as were the armrests. The bathrooms had no hand towels and could not have been cleaned in weeks. It was actually quite unbelievable how a plane was allowed to fly in that state is quite beyond me. The cabin staff just did not seem to care. The plane was also full.

### "hand luggage remained at Lisbon Airport"
I flew from Luanda Angola to Lisbon with my two daughters aged 17 and 5 yrs. We had three hand luggage all of the same size when we got into the when we got into the plane. Two of our hand luggage could not fit in the overhead luggage rack and thus the cabin crew took the bags to the check in luggage despite my protests that the luggage was not labeled and that I was in transit to the UK. When i reached Lisbon i tried to reason with TAP air officials for me to get my hand luggage from the belt to no avail until I left Lisbon for London. As a result my two hand luggage remained at Lisbon Airport. I need assistance to trace and return the two bags to me.

### TAAG Angola Airlines customer review
In January 2023, I was originally supposed to go to Cape Town with Taag via Luanda. When checking in, I had the problem that I had to confirm that I had a yellow fever vaccination. Since I couldn't do that, I contacted the airline. She told me that I really need one. So I had to cancel my flight a few hours before departure and book a new flight and now have 809 euros + 350 euros additional costs. Ultimately, after IATA and the Embassy of South Africa, I wouldn't have needed one. The contact runs via Whats App, which is more than catastrophic. The embassy from Angola has also been blazing with absolute ignorance for the past 3 weeks. I would definitely not fly with them again and I can really advise everyone against this airline. Im Januar 2023 sollte es für mich ursprünglich mit Taag über Luanda nach Cape Town gehen. Beim Einchecken hatte ich das Problem, dass ich bestätigen musste, dass ich über eine Gelbfieberimpfung verfüge. Da ich das nicht konnte, habe ich mich mit der Airline in Verbindung gesetzt. Diese gab mir gegenüber an, dass ich wirklich eine benötige. Ich musste also ein paar Stunden vor Abflug meinen Flug stornieren und einen neuen Flug buchen und habe nun 809 Euro + 350 Euro Mehrkosten. Letztendlich hätte ich aber nach IATA und der Botschaft von Südafrika doch keine gebraucht. Der Kontakt läuft über Whats App, was mehr als katastrophal ist. Auch die Botschaft von Angola glänzt seit 3 Wochen mit absoluter Ignoranz. Ich würde auf keinen Fall mehr mit denen fliegen und kann jedem wirklich dringend von dieser Fluggesellschaft abraten.

### "we had absolutely no problems"
My family flew from Jo'burg to Sao Paolo via Luanda during Dec '22/Jan '23. We were nervous to fly after reading all the bad reviews, but really it was great. Going this route was shorter and a lot cheaper than the available alternatives. All the flights departed on time and arrived on time. Check in, etc. was smooth. We used their Whatsapp enquiry service at some point and got a fairly prompt response. Food was fine (though no veg option), service was fine, Luanda airport was fine (great coffee!). There is no entertainment on most flights (bring a book! ), but we had absolutely no problems during any of the flights (six flights in total between different family members).

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Terrible booking management service, horrible airport, bad airconditioned flight. This is the worst airline I have ever flown. I had to change my flights to a week later and after contacting the airline by phone, Whatsapp, Messenger, Instagram and Email, nobody helped me for 4 days. When someone eventually decided to assist me then they keep on requesting information that i had sent them more than 5 times within the same chat/conversation. Then continued to tell me this was my error when after i made the payment to change my flight through TAAGs online platform, an error page popped up and i heard nothing else in return. The airline took my money and I heard nothing back from them. Tthe aircraft was incredibly stuffy and hot and the airconditioning did not work. Will never be flying this airline again after my return flight. Absolute disappointment and definitely not worth the little money you save compared to other airlines.

### "refused to refund it"
I booked a ticket for November, and in October they had a pilot strike. I decided to cancel the flight at the time and rebook it be on a different airline, and what followed was an entire month of trying to reach them via phone, email and finally Whatsapp messenger. The phone call center assured me that I would be refunded for my ticket and to email an address that always returned the messages; the email never responded; the Whatsapp usually responded hours late and didn't give me a chance to respond. Finally on November 3, just nine days before my flight, they cancelled via WhatsApp but refused to refund it, and in addition imposed a $200 fine for cancellation. This is not an airline, it's a money grabbing scheme.

### "Both flights were 3 hours delayed without communication"
Both flights were 3 hours delayed without communication. First flight delay was because of a fuel stop which apparently happens regularly. The return flights were then even cancelled and there was no alternative route offered via other airlines so that I was stranded 4 days (at the moment 4 days at least) in a shabby hotel in Lisbon. I have checked with real estate agents and am aware of alternative routes with other airlines which TAAG isn't willing to consider. Communication is horrible also. Aircrafts are also poor. Just to give a quick example: there is no TV on any of the flights I've been on - not even in business class. Not that this matters that much but it explains the quality in general. Overall experience 0/10 and I will never fly with them again. Horrible, horrible, horrible.

### "the worst airline"
Not Verified |  TAAG Angola is the worst airline. We didn’t even receive headphones to enjoy the entertainment, a pillow or a blanket for our flight. Not to mention how disappointing the airport is in Luanda, there is no toilet paper & no soap. The disabled bathroom and changing room for babies is an absolute disgrace. I will never do this.

### "Very disappointed customers"
Not Verified |  We travelled to Lisbon in business class and were horrified that airlines still use such old aircraft. The flights from and to Jnb were despicable to say the least. The seats arm rests glued to keep them together, seats torn. We couldn't believe our eyes. The crew were unprofessional with no customer care. On the flights from Luanda to Lisbon and back they had new aircraft but the crew couldn't even operate the TV so no entertainment throughout. No complimentary toiletries for business class. Worse still our baggage was lost. We called Lisbon lost and found office everyday and sent endless emails to no avail as no calls got answered and emails got no response. Out of the blue we received an email at the very end of our 17 day holiday telling us our luggage was in Lisbon. We collected our luggage and checked it in again immediately to return home. At least we should be grateful that although we had no clothing, toiletries, shoes, medication our luggage was found. TAAG need to get a face lift by upgrading your equipment, retire your ancient staff, train the new staff and provide better customer care and better lost and found service. Very disappointed customers.

### "most warming and welcoming experience"
Hesitant to have booked with this airline due to some unfavorable reviews I’ve read. And I can now confirm I will recommend TAAG. The Airbus and the Boeing were both clean, and had much more space than competitors. Food was served efficiently, and the drinks were provided in excess. The transfer in Angola was a bit of a challenge due to the language barrier, so make sure you listen to announcements and your watchful of movings. Inflight entertainment is limited to other competitors, but this wasn’t a make or break for us. Everyone we made contact with in this trip were proud Africans, and after being in Europe for 6 weeks flying with TAAG was the most warming and welcoming experience.

### "they have a long way to go"
An hilarious mixed bag. The aircraft from Cape Town to Luanda was so old, I was expecting it to flap its wings. The service, mediocre. The business class lounge at the Luanda airport was a pleasant surprise The aircraft from Luanda to Lisbon was a most impressive very wide comfortable one As soon as we were air born, the half empty business class filled up with guests from economy class. This was a first from my many years of flying. No menus, nor in flight magazine or entertainment of any kind, and obviously no ear phones or amenity kits. The meal served was tasty, but the tray arrived with paper serviettes and plastic knives forks cups and "glasses", if you believe it! If you decide to fly TAG business class, best you have a sense of humor and realize they have a long way to go, as it is beyond comprehension!

### "Service was friendly"
Not Verified |  We flew with TAAG from  Cape Town. As of a few days ago, passengers in transit no longer need to do the mandatory rapid covid test at airport in Luanda. Cape Town to Luanda is 3.5 hours in an older 737-700. Food was ok, not bad. Service was friendly even with a full flight. No inflight entertainment system. Arriving in Luanda we had to take the rapid test in a hanger. The process takes around 30-60 minutes depending how full flights are. For our return flight (2 weeks later) they thankfully stopped this mandatory testing. You just need to show your negative RT-PCR test (not older than 72 hours of flight). It does not matter if you’re vaccinated or not, the PCR test is all they want to see. Rapid covid tests are not permitted for leaving SA or Portugal. Ground staff are well informed. The wait at Luanda airport was long around 5 hours before boarding the next flight close to midnight. We flew TAAG 5 years ago so coming back to Luanda we had an idea what to expect. In short it’s a chaotic basic airport with little to offer except expensive drinks and food. There are even strange flea market type stalls selling traditional African items. Admittedly the airport has been upgraded a bit, now offering a duty free store and more open seating. This time we stayed in the Pall lounge using our Lounge Key Visa benefit. The lounge is basic but comfortable. They give you a few vouchers to exchange for drinks or toasted sandwiches. At least it is airconditioned. The flight to Lisbon was on a modern 777-300ER with a 3-3-3 seating with some of the best leg room I’ve experienced. At 1.86m tall, I still had plenty room in front of my knees. At present their inflight entertainment system has been turned off. This did not bother us, as at midnight you don’t really want to watch movies…the flight is only 7 hours to Lisbon so sleep comes in handy for a full day ahead. Shortly after take off, they bring you dinner. We had a choice of beef or bacalhau (fish) which was actually quite tasty. The toilets were clean on all flights. Breakfast was also served around 90 minutes before landing in Lisbon. Coming back to Cape Town was only a 2.5 hours transit at Luanda so quite convenient. To go back to SA you don’t need a PCR test if you are vaccinated. If not vaccinated then you have to do the test which is quite expensive around 80euros. All 4 flights there and back were perfectly on time, some even landed earlier than stated. Luggage allowance. Most tickets now cover you for 2 x 23kg bags in economy. Masks have to be worn on all flights except when eating but not heavily enforced. TAAG does not come close to Middle East airlines in terms of inflight entertainment, but the short overall flying time combined with a lower airfare works well for us, especially compared to options on other airlines which take much longer and cost a lot more.

### "an awful experience"
Our inbound and outbound TAAG airline flights, i.e. Lison to South Africa on the 4th December to South Africa to Lisbon on the 16th January 2020 was an awful experience. We will definitely not be flying with this airline in the near future. Our outbound flight was not full and there were a fair amount of empty seats on requesting if we could move to an empty three-seater, he showed no interest in assisting us at all. The food option was terrible and our wine was past its sell-by date. Not once after the meal had been served did we get asked if we required any further drinks etc. Once the meal was served the staff disappeared. Our TV screens did not work 100% and had poor sound. When we arrived in JHB my husband's luggage had been left behind in Luanda which he then received a full two days later. On querying this with Menzies Aviation missing baggage we got absolutely nowhere, in fact, we still waiting for their response! Our inbound flight on the JHB to Luanda leg, two of the toilets were not working just behind us so we had to use the toilets at the extreme back of the plane. On the Luanda to Lisbon's leg the TV screens in the middle section of the plane where we sat were not working at all, on querying this with the steward in our section he said he could move us only to ignore us once the plane had taken off. We sat for 7 hours watching the passengers in the section of the plane in front of us watching their TV screens. I like to watch movies and my husband likes to listen to music.

### "Will not use them again"
Cape Town to Sao Paulo via Luanda. It's a shame to see new, well-spaced between seats airplanes being treated so badly and so poorly maintained. The staff are rude, a On this flight the entertainment system did not work and despite complaints the staff did not even restart the system. The seats are dirty and it's obvious that no maintenance is done. Will not recommend this airline. Will not use them again.

### "worst airline experience"
Johannesburg to Rio de Janeiro via Luanda. This was my worst airline experience ever. It  started a few weeks before the flight with out flight being cancelled. Travelstart confirmed that this happens quite often. The layover in Luanda was dreadful and the airline staff were rude. The ground staff in Rio were exceptionally rude and refused to speak English even though we heard them speak English to an elderly passenger in the queue before us. Our return flight was on an ancient plane. When i asked for a second drink on the eight hour flight, I was told that they did not serve more than one alcoholic drink. Neither my partner nor I had on-board screens that worked.

### "Our worst flight experience"
Not Verified |  Our worst flight experience in 40 years. Maintenance on the cabin area are completely neglected. We were sitting in row 15 and when you switch the reading lights on for row 15 then the lights in row 16 came on. The entertainment systems on all our legs were not working. The seats are dirty and damaged. To top all of this is that the airport building in Luanda is in a terrible state and a true reflection of the rest of the African continent. The ground staff cannot communicate in English and a simple boarding procedure is apart from always late absolutely chaos. I would never fly TAAG again.

### "the worst flight ever"
Cape Town to Porto via Luanda. Must have been the worst flight ever. On departure in Cape Town i had such a bad headache. At take off my seat fell down to the back and we not get it up at all. Customer behind me was so upset as I was on her lap. I reported it and all that I got was they will report it. Toilet not working on the plane and no Screens was working. No crew check safety belts. In Luanda you have to pay $7 to have a cigarette which is insane. On our return flight no screens working, my husband seat was broken and 2 toilets not working. Yes its much quicker flying with them but where is the safety on this flights. I have been trying to contact the airline but with no luck.

### "definitely my worst flight ever"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Rio via Luanda. I traveled to Rio on TAAG airlines via Luanda 24/05-31/05. Had the worst experience of my life. The vegetarian meal was awful. My husband, who’s not vegetarian was also subjected to their awful meals. We were served rock hard rolls with jam. On such a long flight, no inflight entertainment was available. On my return flight the air hostess insisted that I place my small sling bag (A5 book size) in the overhead compartment. I’m a seasoned traveler and despite me letting her know that it was a small bag that I kept under the seat, she’d insisted. This was definitely my worst flight ever!

### "There was no inflight entertainment"
Johannesburg to Sao Paulo via Luanda. I just returned from a lovely holiday in Rio. Sadly I have to comment on the airline. I was really surprised to find the plane in such a bad state the armrests where broken the foot rests broken the pockets on the seat torn. It gets better on an 8.5 hour flight we were not given a vanity bag like other airlines do on an overnight flight. I did carry my own though. There was no inflight entertainment which was really bad on such a long trip. No alcoholic beverages besides beer and wine was served of inferior quality. The air hostess did not understand English! Worst flights ever. Will definitely not use this airline or recommend it.

### "attendants were friendly"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Luanda. My initial scans of reviews made me comfortable to fly with Angolan airlines. However, two weeks before our flight there were some horrific reports and reviews. All these fears were allayed on our first leg of our journey from Johannesburg to Luanda. What surprised me was the leg room space. Flight attendants were friendly and toilets were clean. Food was very satisfactory. Compliments to the pilots, all take offs and landings were smooth. Yes we would travel TAAG Angola Airlines again.

### "staff are rude"
Cape Town to Luanda. It's a shame to see new, well-spaced between seats airplanes being treated so badly and so poorly maintained. The staff are rude and the movies in the entertainment system are the same since 2014. On this flight the entertainment system did not work and despite complaints the staff did not even restart the system. I only travel with them because there is no alternative from Luanda.

### "This airline is truly sad"
Cape Town to Luanda. TAAG improved dramatically under sponsorship from Emirates but all that is gone. The issues start even before you get on the flight. I have been trying for over 4 weeks to get my name corrected on the ticket I paid for. They booked me under my suffix Jr. and even though they have promised to fix this maybe 5 times now they do not. They have offered to book me on another flight or even for more money but not just change my name. I will always choose another airlines going forward. This airline is truly sad.

### "chose TAAG for its really low price"
Rio de Janeiro to Johannesburg via Luanda. We chose TAAG for its really low price. The flight itself didn't have problems but cabin staff was arrogant. The seats were the most comfortable economy seats I've ever seen. Lots of room for your legs and they reclined more than other airlines. The food was okay, we were served 3 times from GIG to JNB. The inflight entertainment was okay, but in many seats the system or the screen was broken. The biggest issue onboard was the air conditioner. There is no individual air vent. So in the beginning of the flights it was really hot, and then it got progressively colder, until you could barely stand it. The blanket was enough for me, but you should have a coat handy. The ground service was mostly okay, except during our layover in Luanda: we boarded and they took us on a bus to the plane. There we waited for 15 minutes with the doors of the bus closed. Then they took us back to the boarding gate in the airport. Nobody ever told us what was happening or what went wrong. The flight got delayed 20 minutes. Not a big problem, but they should tell you what is happening.

### "no maintenance seems to get done"
Johannesburg to Porto via Luanda with TAAG Angola Airlines. Faulty seats all over buisness class on all the flights, did not allow me to adjust the seat at all, the seat next to mine the footrail was in the open position and would not go back. The funny thing is that the staff knew about these issues, faulty seats in business class, let me get comfortable and only after I complained did they say that they were aware and I must look for another seat - I tried another 2 seats with no luck but on the third attempt was lucky. Seat was good, but then the TV & inflight entertainment was not working. The magazines were from the previous months, all in a terrible state, some seats had the magazines other seats no magazines at all. At the lounge in Luanda in dialogue with other buisness class passengers they expressed similar issues. I am a frequent traveler and must say this has been one of my worst trips ever. It's a real pity that no maintenance seems to get done on these planes.

### "faulty seats in business class"
Luanda to São Paulo. Faulty seat, did not allow me to adjust the seat at all! The worst issue is that the staff knew about various (at least 3) faulty seats in business class. The staff avoided my request to try to resolve and offered no solution as business class was full. I had booked a family of 5 passengers all on business class and to say that this ruined my holiday is an understatement. First class was 90% empty, but no offer at all was entertained. I am a frequent traveler and must say this has been my worst trip ever, stayed awake throughout the night and no apology received at all.

### "a low standard airline"
Cape Town to Porto return via Luanda. Of the four flights we were on this airline for our trip from Cape Town to Porto, the in-flight entertainment was broken on three. The staff could hardly speak or understand English. The ambient temperature was either too hot on one flight or too cold on another. On-board catering took excruciatingly long to get going. Overall, a low standard airline. A huge pity because if the airline realised the potentially huge market they have on this route, they'd improve their standards without question.

### "more than satisfied with the airline"
I have flown many times on the Cape Town to Lisbon route via Taag over the last year and have been more than satisfied with the airline. The 3-3-3 seating offers significantly more space than the airlines with a 3-4-3 configuration and the stopover in Luanda breaks the monotony of the long flight to Europe. Disembarking to a bus in Luanda lets you appreciate the scale of the B777, if you are interested in aircraft this will be a highlight. Luanda airport is not a great place, very expensive drinks and food, not much to do, but on the positive side it seems to be much cleaner than before (please keep that up). The 7 hour flight to Lisbon goes quickly and I slept through most of it, so the limited range of movies did not bother me. Food is fine for economy, its actually quite tasty and the presentation has improved a lot, the red wine was a very pleasant Portuguese wine from the Douro valley. The hosts and hostesses got their job done efficiently and pleasantly, though one host from Cape Town to Luanda clearly was not there out of love. All in all, no one will ever rave about an economy flight but this is one of the best and most comfortable ways to get to Europe from South Africa and while it seems that the Emirates management has stopped (Since June 2017) it has not affected the service.

### "seat had very good legroom"
Cape Town to Rio de Janeiro via Luanda. Flight to Luanda check in at Cape Town Airport was smooth and quick. The flight departed on time. Boarding was organised and friendly. The aircraft was spotlessly clean and felt in good condition. The entertainment system worked well, but had very limited selection. The meal served was tasty and sufficient. Cabin crew were somewhat robotic and stone faced-perhaps the language barrier. My seat had very good legroom, and was comfortable. Luanda Airport really let the side down. Terrible place, badly organised, with very limited food and drink options, and too few toilets. The flight to Rio departed late mainly due to Luanda Airport slowing everything down. The flight to Rio was similarly of good standard. Nothing exceptional, but in all it was good.

### "only one meal option"
Cape Town to Lisbon via Luanda. The flight crew was friendly and quite accommodating, even assisting an old couple flying with twins to much more convenient seats by appealing to other passengers who too were quite willing to exchange their seats. On board entertainment was varied, but on one of my flights the screen had not been working. Fortunately, even though the cabin crew had made an attempt to address the problem, I could sleep aboard that flight quite comfortably with enough leg room as well, making entertainment less of a necessity. However, upon my return flight to Cape Town from Luanda there was only one meal option as a hot breakfast and it was served with bacon, which I thought was a failing on the part of an otherwise professional airline. One cannot in this day and age overlook people's dietary preferences whether for religious, lifestyle or health reasons. (My reason is religious ) the least they could have done was have more than one meal option. I'd like to fly with TAAG again but this would be a consideration should I book with TAAG. I hope this will be addressed because I am certain that many passengers will be put off by this should they be personally affected as I was.

### "problem in the system"
Maputo to Lisbon via Luanda on 22nd June 2017. We had a more than 1 hour check in and ground staff told us that we would be standing by in Luanda as there was a problem in the system, but I didn't accept this solution as I know that if there would be any problem, we couldn't even get into an Hotel in Luanda as we would be allowed to issue a visa. After more than 1 hour, we had the tickets in our hands, we were having tea in the lounge after we cleared all the migration. When we heard our names from the PA of the airport, we were told to go to the check in counter. Nobody told us what was happening (we were there with another family of 3, in the same situation). Our bags were at the check in so I understood that no way we would get in that flight. Needless to say that the tickets were bought way in advance. The ground staff told us to wait for 4 minutes. He told us that all will be solved. We waited. Has soon as the check in was closed he told the ground staff to close the check in and he didn't even had the courtesy to look at us and provide us with a solution. I asked him to assist us with the migration problem at least as we had already stamped our passports. He told us he will assist but as soon as he drop us at the migration office and we turned our backs he disappeared.

### "£the shortest, cheapest route"
Johannesburg to Lisbon via Luanda. It was the shortest, cheapest route compared to other airlines. At times communication was a bit challenging because the airline is more Portuguese than English, not the friendliest flight staff. On the ground at check-in in both Johannesburg and Lisbon the staff were friendly and extremely accommodating. In Luanda, on my return flight - not so much - was told to stand one side and constantly sternly told to wait - not that I was moving or saying anything. For the price you can't actually .

### "my first and last time with TAAG"
Johannesburg to Lisbon via Luanda, it was my first time flying with TAAG but unfortunately it will be the last. I checked in online and booked 3 seats together, when I got to the airport I was informed my seats had to be changed. I got on board (to my new seats) and found the 2 of the seats were missing the entertainment screens. Cables were loose and hanging from the space where the TV screens are supposed to be. I told the air hostess and she informed she would move us once we were in the air. Once we were in the air the air hostess refused to talk to me and refused to move us. I complained and said if there is no room on economy they must move me elsewhere, again I was ignored and eventually one air hostess shouted at me that I will not be moving. I was informed the entertainment screens were not working before our flight by the staff – so they sold us seats without telling us the problems. One air hostess then apologized and said I must write in the complaints book - when I asked for it they refused to give me a pen or any of their names. Finally, the whole economy section had problems with the aircon and everyone was complaining about the heat and discomfort.

### "pleasantly surprised with TAAG"
I was pleasantly surprised with TAAG flying return from Cape Town to Lisbon via Luanda, the aircraft was clean, the meals very good though the presentation and accompaniments were on the cheap side. Seats were comfortable and the 3x3x3 seating feeling much more spacious than the 3x4x3 found many airlines 777's. Ground staff in Cape Town were pleasant and the crew pleasant throughout. Luanda airport could be vastly improved by offering clean toilets, otherwise it is OK. Luanda airport also has a boneyard of abandoned aircraft, some interesting specimens. While only using the flight tracking on the in flight entertainment it seemed to have a selection of films and shows. Considering the price, speed and great route from South Africa to Portugal there is no competition and I am already booked for my next flight with them.

### "service was mixed - some friendly, others less so"
Cape Town to Luanda (and back) on slightly older 777-300, but still in good condition. Luanda - Lisbon (and back) on 6 month old 777-300 - very good condition. It had larger screens than the older one - but less movie options, which did not quite match those listed in the in-flight magazine - either way selection is limited. Flight map system much improved in the newer plane. Seats the same slimline style on all planes, comfortable enough, with good recline and leg space. Pillows are provided, but no blankets by default. Catering is decidedly low cost - flimsy plastic tray and so on, and cheap plastic cutlery, however the food was not bad at all. Service was mixed - some friendly, others less so, English definitely not spoken well. Luanda stopover thankfully short, as airport is primitive, with multiple flights leaving from the same gate at the same time, which causes a bit of chaos - nothing too serious though - you will be checked to make sure you won't get on the wrong plane. Airport has no air bridges, so you get a good impression of the sheer size of the 777-300's as you walk up the stairs. This is the most direct route from Cape Town to Portugal, hence the quickest way to get there, as the feeder flights from/to Cape Town/Johannesburg are well-timed. Arrival time in Lisbon (early morning) and departure time (late at night), also very convenient. All in all the combination of new planes (nice), good price, with acceptable levels of service and catering, make this a really good option for getting to Europe from South Africa.

### "crew were friendly and professional"
My flight on 26th of August, from Johamnnesbug to Lisbon via Luanda, was as good as my return flight a month later on 25th September. Four planes of 777 and 777-300 used for my journeys. The food was tasty, the cabin crew were friendly and professional. Most important was the fact that the take off and landings where the best I have experienced in recent years. The price was good value for money. Luanda airport is poor, no shops to pass the time, but at least we don't walk kilometers to change terminals, which is a plus. The waiting time between flights is only about two hours and bearable. Another plus is the weight you are allowed to take. I will definitely fly TAAG again.

### "cabin crew were friendly and efficient"
Needing to get from Cape Town to Lisbon and back again wasting as little time as possible, I found that TAAG fly this route, with a change of planes in Luanda. Not knowing quite what to expect, I booked, and was pleasantly surprised. The planes on the Cape Town - Luanda legs are a bit old and tatty, and on the outward leg the entertainment system did not work. They are 777s, but in 3-4-3 configuration in Economy. The main downside of this route is Luanda airport, which is Ok, but somewhere you don't want to have to stay too long. The Luanda - Lisbon legs are operated by new 777-300ER planes in 3-3-3 configuration with good entertainment systems, but maybe not the best choice of films. Food and service was good. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient.

### "service was outstanding"
Cape Town to Lisbon via Luanda with TAAG Angolan. Seamless check-in in Cape Town with luggage checked all the way to Lisbon. Older 777-200 on first leg to Luanda. Old AVOD system but decent selection. Seats needed a clean but otherwise comfortable for 3 hour leg. Largely male cabin crew who went out of their way to chat and were friendly. Food was lamb, well presented and tasty. Luanda Airport is something to miss if possible. Final leg onwards to Lisbon was on board their new 777-300ER which was 2 months old. Cabin crew once again friendly, engaging. Food was special meals (steamed fish, vegetables, lovely sauce) with coconut cake. All better than expected and I finished it. The AVOD and seat on the new plane was wonderful. The service was outstanding, the plane exceptionally clean and I would recommend this airline. The cabin crew dealt with a number of unaccompanied minors in a most sincere fashion both on board and with the ground team. Luanda Airport though is something to spend as little time in as possible.

### "excellent value for money"
Flew TAAG Angola Airlines, Cape Town to Lisbon via Luanda. Left on time, the service was slightly reserved but at least not false, good food and enough leg space. Clean plane, all security protocols are being executed. The price was excellent value for money. 3 hours in Luanda just bearable. Going to book soon again, before the promotion is over.

### "cabin crew were friendly"
Johannesburg to Luanda with TAAG Angola. The check-in at OR Tambo Airport was a bit of a hassle because it was the first day of new baggage rules. However, once in the air, the experience was excellent value for money. The flight departure was on time and the meal served was one of the most delicious I have had onboard a flight for a long time. The TAAG cabin crew were friendly and efficient. I frequently use TAAG on this route and will continue to do so.

### "overpriced for the quality"
I flew TAAG Angola Airlines from Luanda to Cape Town and Windhoek to Luanda.The flights were okay, nothing really bad. My complaint is that it was overpriced for the quality of the flight. The planes for both legs were clean although cabins were not well maintained. The service on board was abysmal. There were no courtesy from the FAs. The toilets were run out of toilet papers and were dirty but FAs didn't bother to clean them up. The food were just for survival. Would I recommend this airline - no. However, I doubt there is competition for the route so you might end up taking this airline.

### TAAG Angola Airlines customer review
DT 653 13th April. This is one of the best airlines I have flown. Flight attendants were nice and helpful. Seats could still be better but I had a good sleep and breakfast was good served with nice hot tea! Nice entertainment for adults and for kids with the latest movies and some documentaries.

### TAAG Angola Airlines customer review
I recently started using TAAG more regularly especially flying to South Africa the aircraft's are fresh clean and new the staff friendly and professional. The airlines services are excellent from online booking to early check-ins in Luanda. There are still areas with room for improvement such as the inflight entertainment choice and catering presentation on Business class. These two issues tackled TAAG will be providing a world class service that can compete with the best in the African continent and globally.

### TAAG Angola Airlines customer review
Flew Luanda/Lisbon on business class. Boeing 777 very clean. Inflight entertainment system was not working and the reading light also so the only available option was to try to sleep. Meals not very good but the crew was very friendly.

### TAAG Angola Airlines customer review
LAD-DXB. Was surprised with the level of service provided on the flight. Following the check in at Luanda the flight was pretty good. Departed 30 mins late and arrived early in Dubai. Flight was not very full so plenty of space to spread out. Food while basic was of good standard and the drinks service was good. The plane was a new B777. IFE system is basic but being a late night flight didn't really use it. Having a basic understanding of Portuguese helped but all crew spoke and understood English. Overall after reading previous reviews I was pleasantly surprised.

### TAAG Angola Airlines customer review
LAD-JNB trip in economy class. Noticed a big improvement with the staff at the check-in counters. The entertainment was ok and we were offered a hot snack. One thing that never changes though is the rudeness of the flight attendants.

### TAAG Angola Airlines customer review
LAD-CPT-LAD. Check-in easy no problems. The flights were uneventful but the interior of the planes were very old and it appeared that at least one armrest in each row was broken as they were taped up or visibly falling apart. Seats from LAD to CPT were quite comfortable but there was no IFE for a nearly 4 hr flight. CPT to LAD the seats were very uncomfortable. IFE on this flight on drop-down screens but the audio was played over the PA system so it was difficult to hear. Overall customer service was typical of Angola - non-existent. I would only recommend for the convenience to CPT from LAD.

### TAAG Angola Airlines customer review
LIS to LAD. The flight was delayed seven hours - first because of a mechanical problem and then because of the airport curfew in LIS. This left only 30 minutes to make our connection in LAD for our flight to WDH. TAAG put us in a hotel for the night free of charge. The staff in LIS were helpful and friendly. We ended up making our 30 minute connection because a TAAG agent in Luanda had checked us in for our connecting flight and escorted us to our Air Namibia flight to WDH. The flight was operated by a Boeing 777-200ER which was comfortable. There is AVOD mood lighting footrests and winged headrests on this aircraft. The food was tasty and cabin crew friendly.

TAAG's good air service is sabotaged by the Luanda ground service staff. We have flown once from Luanda/Cape Town and once from Windhoek to Luanda. Those three flights left almost an hour late but once in the air the service in Economy class was pleasant. We received free drinks and a hot meal. The attendants were very pleasant as well. The ground service in Luanda for international flights is acceptable.

As I arrived in JNB from Cape Town I noticed that my flight to Luanda was cancelled. No explanation from anybody I found out that all TAAG flights earlier the week was cancelled. Just to be told tomorrows flight will be first come first serve I had to arrange and pay for my own accommodation in JNB. Next day check in at 09h00was informed plane was late sit at the airport until that afternoon. No food or drinks was offered to the passengers only boarded plane at 1800. I noticed my booked seat was taken I showed my pass to one staff member and I were pushed into another seat staff very rude and unhelpful. Onboard entertainment poor.

I have flown with SAA before and with TAAG. The flights on TAAG have not been to bad I unfortunately do not understand or speak Portuguese and this I find a problem. With regards to the service I cannot complain. I have a complaint about the airport personnel at Luanda. They are rude pass comments on all foreign clients and give us a hard time in general. Should you have any dollars with you they confiscate them and tell you that you cannot keep the money with you. This I have a problem with. If you cannot keep your dollars on you how are you supposed to buy any cold drink or food while you wait for the flight? This is not complimentary from TAAG. The airport is dirty to boot. Today I am struggling with my ticket back to JNB and will most certainly not make use of TAAG again. I will use SAA in future as I can depend on them.

TAAG business class a few weeks go from Luanda to Johannesburg and was astonished at the poor and unprofessional service encountered from check in to my destination. I arrived at the airport at 0530 which was the check in time written on my ticket by the lady at the TAAG office only to find that check in for the flight will only start at 0630. When the check in eventually started I was confronted by a security guard who told me to go to the back of the economy class line despite my business class ticket. Two hours later I was checked in and besides the customs official who wanted to confiscate my camera because it had rechargable batteries in it and the fiscal official who demanded a detailed explanation for the $1100 I had with me I went to the business class lounge. There was no coffee no tea and only four bottles of water in the refrigerator and four bunched up sandwiches with what looked like ketchup on it. I asked the lady attendant for some coffee. She did not reply disappeared and I never saw her or the coffee again. Boarding late due to some delay (B747) went fine and I was in my seat with no trouble - which I had to clean and get rid of a handful of dried bread crumbs. The cabin staff were an unfriendly bunch of which only one could speak a very broken English on an international flight. I fortunately speak reasonable Portuguese which helped. Service had a taste of rudeness in from most of cabin staff. Food in the business class was appaling. The beef was cold and served in exactly the same holders as economy class and with plastic utensils and cups. The bread resembled good old fashioned rusks as I suspect that it came from the previous day and coffee was cold. Passengers needed to request the attendants to remove meal trays after an hour had gone by in which they were giggling away in the galley area and not attending to passengers. The toilets on the aircraft were filthy. Onboard entertainment was a movie with no earphones available. When disembarking at Jhb - Oliver Tambo - the one air hostess rudely refused an economy class passenger a quick exit before business class passengers as he was running out of time to make check in for a connecting flight - even though he produced his ticket to the air hostess and the TAAG flight left Luanda 45 minutes late. TAAG should pull up their socks if they want to become part of global economy in the airline business. Their business class service at the airport is poor to say the least and onboard service even worse. Their cabin staff need a course in manners and professionalism and quality control on the aircraft needs to be addressed. Passengers pay extra for business class service but plastic eating utensils and poor quality food and service hardly justifies that.

Initially the flight was supposed to leave at 12h00 midday. On our arrival at the airport we were told that the flight would leave at 22h00 that evening and check in start at 17h00. Long story short we only left the following morning at 05h20. The business class lounge had no more drinks at 20h00 not even a glass of water. No apologies offered. The food was terrible and the service unfriendly bordering on rude. Inflight entertainment non-existing! Our connecting flights all missed no accommodation offered. A trip from Luanda to Goiania that should have taken me 12 hours took 28 hours of travelling. The return trip was scheduled to Leave Luanda on Tuesday 11 March at 18h00. I left the interior very early on Tuesday morning (04h00) arriving at Rio airport at midday ready to check in. I was informed at 14h00 that the flight was cancelled and that I should return the next morning at 05h00 to be on the stand-by list! No accomodation offered. I booked into a hotel at my own costs and returned the next morning at 05h00. Finally got on the plane by 10h00 and the flight took off at 10h30. Inflight entertainment was a movie with sub-titles in English but no microphones offered. The food was absolutely horrible. Needless to say there are no other airlines flying this route and beggars cant be choosy!

I used to fly TAAG back and forth to Paris. What a shambles - delays were the norm with no explanation from anyone. A delay at Luanda airport we could handle (just) as long as the bar was kept open but when they shut the bar at 10 with no warning that was it! As for the flights meals on the plane were practically thrown at the passengers and I can honestly say that the staff were often quite rude and in no way helpful to anyone. Why they were there I can only guess and I think it may have something to do with the drinks trolley. The planes until very recently were more suited to sitting in a museum. Thankfully our company have now refused to allow us to fly with this mickey- mouse airline and given the choice I would never fly with them again.

Lisboa-Luanda Luanda-Rio de Janeiro. First leg of the trip on Boeing 777. Very nice confortable seats. PTV's with AVOD ok. Food normal. The breakfast was tiny. Second leg of the trip on Boeing 747 Mixed. Seats more confortable than the 777 but the inflight entertainment was disappointing.

### TAAG Angola Airlines customer review
Boeing 777 configuration was 3-4-3 in economy class. The flight was almost completely full in Economy class not sure about Business or First class. Seat was comfortable legroom was okay and had a foot rest and a normal size PTV. Oddly enough the jack for the head set was straight in front instead of in the armrest. They had big pillows and blanket at every seat. I was seated towards the back in row 32; last row was 38 on TAAG’s 777. The seat also had the “winged” headrest to make for easier sleeping. Candy (honey) was given out - a nice gesture. Fairly soon after take off dinner was served. During dinner the crew came around again with a second round of drinks including wine. The crew in general was a bit reserved but friendly. There was the new mood lighting but only in F and C class. I tried their inflight entertainment system which is AVOD and it was okay. Water was offered once during the flight by the flight attendants. Breakfast was served about 1.5 hours before arrival and was very small; smallest I have ever seen but very good. To sum it up TAAG was a very pleasant surprise having heard of horror stories and also since they don’t have a functioning website. TAAG was just as modern comfortable as European carriers and it was a great experience.

TAAG Angola Airlines are a complete shambles. Our flight out to Luanda from Windhoek was delayed 18hrs. We are currently (2 November 2006) still waiting for our return flight after our flight was today cancelled for the third successive day. The worst part is that they tell you the flight will leave early and then end up stringing you along all day at the airport before you finally find out there is no plane. I have now wasted 3 days at the airport. No one seems to have a clue what is going on there is no information provided on delays or reasons and it has proved impossible to identify a ´responsible´person. I could go on an on about the problems we have experienced. Avoid using them at all costs!
