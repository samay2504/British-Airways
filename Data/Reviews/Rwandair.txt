### “flight staff are friendly”
Not Verified | As far as the airline itself, the flight staff are friendly, the food is good and we had a really good experience.. one downside is that our entertainment system was not working on our first flight from Paris.. and once in Rwanda, the airport staff are rude and unfriendly.. also for smokers, be aware there is only ONE smoking area and you have to pay $10 per person to enter.

### “Service impeccable”
Flew Kigali-Doha (and onwards with Royal Air Maroc) afternoon 23th January 2025 on a B737-800. On time. Ticket issued by Qatar Airways which caused limitations on seating, food, and miles crediting as Rwandair cannot exhibit flexibility cum overrule the QR booking in any way. E.g. I could not preorder meal due to differing booking systems – typically a codeshare issue. Checked in 6 hours early to enjoy Dream lounge in Kigali. Check-in smooth, luggage checked in to final destination, though BPs could not be issued beyond Doha. Eventually I got my favourite exit seat. Could choose among the two lounges in Kigali: Dream and Pearl. Both are well stocked, only hot snacks are not offered any more. Dream has an upper hand with city view. Onboard, FAs are good, polite, well rested and groomed. Service impeccable. Only 1 meal service on this 5 hours’ flight. No WiFi nor personal IFE, only childish movies shown on shared monitors. Seats well bolstered, spacious. Fine “boutique” airline with only 15 aircrafts which are few in case of irregularities. Good trip, recommended.

### "Delay after delay"
Delay after delay after delay - every time. Waste a whole day with them . Madly expensive airport that insists on full security screen removing water and lighters even if you’re transiting and purchased after security in a main hub airport

### "Catering faultless"
Flew direct from Paris to Kigali New Years evening 2024 on A330-200. Change of terminal in Paris can take 1-2 hours; best is to leave the transit and use the trains. Rwandair has only 13 aircraft and only two airline partners, thus potentially things can go wrong. Luggage transfers are often not accepted by other airlines. Check-in in T1 went smooth, though the lady was not experienced neither knowing aircraft type nor terminal well. I have a goldcard with this airline which gave access to the very nice Extime contract Lounge in T1. Despite that the flight was 75% full, I managed at boarding, to get 3 seats for myself and could recline and stretch out. Catering faultless, my preordered special meal was quite good. Drinks given generously at all times. Wines were acceptable. Headsets, pillows, and blankets given to everybody. IFE was working well and choices were sufficient. In the morning a modest breakfast was served without any hot drinks; these could be obtained in galley. Staff were humble, polite, well groomed, and in general very active. On time, all luggage handled well. Cheap, promotional ticket bought 8 months prior to travel. Recommend.

### "Extremely good value for money"
Kigali-Paris 10th Dec. 2024 on one of their 3 A330 aircrafts. Checked in online smooth, but is unnecessary and does neither add value nor gain time. I chose an entire seat-row for free due to my Gold Status with Rwandair’s Dream Miles Program. Marburg declarations forms have to be filled prior to enter the airport. Check-in slow, 20 minutes per pax, but they managed to check-in luggage onwards with other airline. Dream lounge in Kigali is a pleasure with panorama windows over town. Catering options varied, a bit sparse; the best hot snacks appear not to reach the lounge easily, only on firm request. I suspect, that they are consumed by lounge staff, have seen indications hereof. Wines are subpar. No sparkling wine offered. Flight on time; 30% full; on time. Seafood meal preordered and given. Generous catering. They gave me, on early request, an entire row onboard for better sleep. Blankets, ear-set, and pillows given. Very affordable ticket (425 USD t/r) purchased 6 months before departure. Extremely good value for money. Miles given.

### "delayed Kigali to London by 11 hours"
Not Verified |  Disappointing, delayed Kigali to London by 11 hours thus losing London train fares. Not refundable. No offer of meals, accomodation no response to e mails. Eventually responded with vague promise of accommodation. Seem to happen often

### “interior of aircraft was very worn”
Flew Kigali to Nairobi for 1st leg of a trip to the US in mid October 2024, aircraft was an extremely old and worn-out Dash-8 aircraft, hardly airworthy. About everything went wrong as their multiple added delays and postponements costing us 5 hours. The issue started from 2 weeks before with a 1st postponement and reschedule by Rwandair. I realised a hastily shrinking, narrow timeslot in Nairobi could cause me missing onward flights so asked them to travel ½-1 day earlier to avoid trouble. They refused to prepone and claimed that 70 minutes transfer time was sufficient. On a further announced delay, they then forgot to adjust arrival time; de facto leaving me with only 10 minutes for transit before final, unannounced added delay. Rwandair resumed no responsibility and in airport they refused my request to rebook me to their direct flight Kigali to Paris as my routing to the US would pass Paris anyway. Thus, I lost 2 days stranded in Nairobi. On the positive side: luggage checked in to final destinations despite not all legs were with the airline. Access to their Dream lounge granted in Kigali; the lounge is fine, but it appears lounge staff eat most of the hot snacks meant for passengers. Onboard, FAs and services are fine, my special hot-meal accommodated, drinks were plenty. The interior of aircraft was very worn, tapes padding, patches, scratches, and everything appeared shaky. Worst was the incredible noise from the propels and engine, making it a very shaky, nightmare-like flight. A last minute, new delay was said the be replacement of a spare-part, not very comforting. Could not hear announcements. The airline suffers from lack of airline partners and lack of aircrafts. The new airport being built in Bugesera seems superfluous and overkill, would likely only be used to 5% of its huge, ambitious capacity.

### “seats were nice, but very cramped”
Flew Joburg to Kigali 24th Aug. 2024 on a B337-700. Upgraded an economy ticket to business but did not receive much added value as economy deliver similar, relatively better product, for 30% of price paid for business. Flight was full. The 12 seats in the small business class cabin were nice, but very cramped, hardly a meter between the rows, so at recline no space in front. From window impossible to reach the aisle unless disturbing seatmates. Very noisy aircraft without IFE, WiFi, predeparture drinks, menu card, or amenity kits. Drink list was promising by far too much as reality showed limits. Champagne not offered. Wines were decent. Their widebody aircrafts provide a much better product. FAs were good and caring, but the noisy aircraft prevented good communication. Preordered seafood meal given, but gets the same meal if seated in economy. Announcements in 3 languages barely audible. On time, no luggage issues. Will travel again, but next time in economy class if aircraft turns out to be narrow-bodied.

### "Worst experience ever"
Lost bags, not sure when I will receive my bags with my mediation. No customer service and everyone at the airport appear unbothered to assist. We were moved onto a very very very small plane when we arrived to Rwanda which didn’t fit all bags now all bags have been lost. No communication on what will happen next. Worst experience ever, will not be flying with them again.

### "kindness and attentiveness"
Kigali-Joburg 26 June 2024 in an old, narrowbody B737. I was upgraded from an inexpensive economy ticket to business class by using miles in their Dream Miles Frequent Flyer Program. Check-in and lounge access in Kigali smooth as usual. Luggage was kindly checked in to final destination 4 legs ahead on different tickets and airlines. That’s a courtesy winner which hardly any European airlines can cope with. Check-in issued my 4 onward Boarding Passes on the spot, which made my life easy by staying in transits throughout the journey enjoying entitlements and lounges - instead of struggling with immigration and landside e.g. in South Africa. Lounge in Kigali is good, though still with room for minor improvements. Boarding easy by walking 150m on tarmac directly to the aircraft. The 12 business seats were in 3 rows in 2 x 2 configuration. I had 1D to avoid direct exposure to the rising morning sun. In economy, seats are narrower and in 3 x 3 configuration. Morning flight, departed on time and arrived slightly early. Onboard, seating perfect, special meal accommodated, other hot meals offered were also good. No drinks and no food menu provided. Unclear what they actually had onboard for catering. Drinks and wine selection sparse and modest. However, we were offered pre-departure champagne (Piper Heidshick?). FAs were generous, pampering us well, and of world class in kindness and attentiveness. They might benefit from further airline exposures. IFE is useless, no headsets given. Given FFP miles instantly according to my original booking. Luggage well handled. Cannot demand much more for regional flights in business class.

### "staff in the airports are horrible"
Fly at your own risk. First and last time to fly with this company. Changed the hour of departure 3 times without any remorse. Hospitality at its lowest,. At Kigali, they had the nerve of changing my seat without any explanation, i decided to ask why only to be rudely replied and no answer to my question. Treated like i was flying on their expense The food part, i am short of words. Security check in Kigali left me wondering if we are criminals. Their staff in the airports are horrible. If you want value for your money try something else. Never again, wish i had read the online reviews before booking with them.

### "undervalued by most travelers"
Flew Paris to Kigali 16th May 2024. A330-200 aircraft. Check-in Paris was easy and smooth. Rwandair uses “extime lounge” in T1: a splendid 3rd party lounge above expectations. Onboard, I was recognised by staff as gold-card holder and could choose seat. Eventually, I got an entire middle row with 4 seats for myself, which was a great gift, allowing me to sleep. Got delicious special seafood meal and later I tried the chicken dish as well, which also was good. Breakfast very modest. IFE system acceptable with individual screens; headsets was provided. Flight was half full. Left on time and landed early. Luggage was prioritized and well handled. I took advantage of a generous 2 x 23 kg luggage allowance They even allowed me 50 kg without penalizing me. Frequent flier miles credited instantly upon arrival. This, despite the ticket was promotional and quite cheap. Will fly them again. The airline needs obviously airline partners/alliance for smoother luggage transfers and better recognition It is, unfairly, undervalued by most travelers. Another weakness is their very limited number of aircrafts which, in case of irregularities, could cause snowball effects and delays due to few or none replacements easily available.

### "A short and pleasant flight"
A short and pleasant flight at an affordable price. The boarding is smooth, but way too early prior to departure. Plane was clean; water served and on-time landing. Will fly with them again

### "still stranded in Kigali"
The most useless airline I have ever flown. They cancelled my flight three hours before departure. No hotel accommodation was give, no info about the next available flight. Had to go back to their headquarters today and I met a an incompetent supervisor who refuses to let me talk to the manager or someone with a higher authority than him. Imagine him telling me that they are protecting me by conditioning me to wait till tomorrow and fly 18 hours or wait till Monday evening and do 15 hours back to Brussel, when other flights like KLM, Brussels Air, Turkish Air are available today. My advice to anyone, please refrain from taking Rwandair because the customers rights are not guaranteed or in any way respected. Am still stranded in Kigali. Not sure when to depart.

### “Staff were good, attentive, polite”
Pleasant, direct flight Kigali-Paris 4th April 2024 one of their (3?) A330-200. Ticket inexpensive, purchased on their website under promotion. However, initial ticket was not adjusted for European summer time which had just begun at the time of travel. Upon their discovery hereof, WB made schedule changes from Kigali causing a much later arrival in France. This caused made me fear losing my connection in Paris, to which I had only 55 Minutes to catch in a remote terminal. However, the Rwandair flight arrived 20 minutes early, which saved me. Dream lounge in Kigali is nice, accessed through my Dream-miles membership. However, every time I go there, budget and catering cuts are notable. Recent cuts are on hot snacks, lack of any imported soft drinks and beers, lack of alternative brewery representation (only products from Bavaria offered). Wines are undrinkable. No presence of music, no volume on TVs so the lounge is too quiet like a national museum. To watch Premier League in silence is tragic. Check-in a breeze. Had a dialogue on seating and I eventually had 4 seats to myself in row 13, as few wants that row number. Boarding quick and easy; by foot over tarmac. Catering is among the best of African airlines. Preordered seafood of high quality was given early, within 5 Minutes after seatbelt sign was switched off. Got a chance to test another type of fish meal as well, it was also delicious. Breakfast forgettable. Drinks fine, wines are surprisingly good, much better than those in their Kigali lounge. IFE was fine headsets given to all who wanted. Staff were good, attentive, polite, accommodating, and caring. The passenger is the king is never patronised unless in extreme cases. KLM staff could learn a lot here. Flight almost full, but due to my faith in row no. 13, I could stretch out across seats, and got a lot of sleep. Recommended. Miles credited instantly. A drawback for Rwandair is its isolation by not belonging to any bigger airline alliance. Partnership with Qatar Airways is weak, not reciprocal and does not access the Oneworld alliance.

### "the seat itself comfortable"
RwandAir has a curious way of boarding passengers at Kigali Airport. Business passengers are invited to board first and are transported to the aircraft on a bus fitted with comfortable seats. However, after leaving the departure lounge, they are then held back while all the other passengers board an ordinary bus before they allowed on to their bus and driven to the aircraft. I can see what they're attempting to do but the reality is that you are left standing in a corridor, in my case for about ten minutes, before going to the aircraft. The A330 was clean and the seats, in my view, an almost perfect design with all of the controls accessible, the seat itself comfortable and the bed flat enough to sleep on. We were offered champagne, orange juice or water and orders for the meal taken before departure. The meal service was done effectively and although the presentation was more premium economy the food was tasty and there was a good selection of drinks. What was remarkable was the way in which one member of cabin crew managed to serve the entire business section with nobody kept waiting. Airlines will charge higher prices because they offer improved levels of service. RwandAir business flights tend to be far lower than rivals yet this flight demonstrated a quality far greater than the more expensive options on offer on its routes. All that it needs to do is to solve the weird boarding routine which I have experienced on more than one occasion.

### "I was impressed by the flight"
Rwandair’s A330 business seats are functional with no obvious weaknesses. There was ample storage space at the side, a nice screen, well-placed sockets and switches and they all had aisle access. The best seats for single travellers are the window seats. Rwandair uses the No.1 Lounge at LHR which is nothing special and it was full to capacity although I did manage to get a seat. Boarding was efficient with business given priority. Departure was delayed for almost two hours by an unspecified technical fault but the cabin crew were happy to supply more champagne when asked. The meal service was efficient although drinks took a while to come. The food and wine choices were uninspiring. The flat bed was moderately comfortable and the cabin was kept pleasantly warm. Overall, I was impressed by the flight and given that the cost was considerably less than most other airlines it was good value for money.

### "Its very disappointing"
I was very disappointed, their customer care is totally not good, they delay to take away utensils after dinner, the flight to Entebbe was delayed for more than a hour, Checking in at Heathrow was horrible, I was able to pay for my extra bag, but there was a lot of their staff all over me. I am now stuck at Kigali airport for more than an hour, no update for my next flight. Its very disappointing. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

### "beyond appalling"
I was scheduled to return to London, UK from Douala, Cameroon on January 05 at 1700 via Rwandair. I was flying with my wife and two young children (1 and 2 years old). We arrived at 1500 at Douala airport only to be told that the flight had been rescheduled for an earlier time and had already left. The flight was changed and no effort whatsoever was made to inform me. The staff acknowledge that we were not informed of the schedule update and apologised for the situation. We were then informed that the next available Rwandair flight to London was at 1700 on January 07. When we asked the Rwandair staff about flights leaving on 05 January via other airlines, we were initially told there were no other flights leaving on any airlines on 05 January - they were all fully booked. After speaking to Brussels airlines directly I was able to confirm that there was a flight leaving on 05 January at 2000. However, the only seats available were in business class. When this information was put to the Rwandair representative, he confirmed that there were indeed flights available with other airlines on the 05 January at higher fare classes (i.e. Business class). As my family missed our flight as a result of Rwandair oversight, I informed the representative that it was Rwandair's responsibility to rectify the situation. Even if this meant my family being upgraded to business class on the 2000 Brussels airline flight. However, the Rwandair representative was unwilling to take this course of action. They stated that they needed approval from senior management to book a a flight on another airline with a higher fare. The staff stated that as it was 1600 on a Friday, the senior management were not reachable. After lengthy discussions, they agreed to email senior management and seek approval. However, they refused to call senior management. I therefore contacted different representatives of Rwandair myself (using contact details online) to seek senior management approval. I was eventually able to speak to who I was told was the country manager. The country manager was not surprised this situation had occurred and rather than trying to rectify the situation, simply stated that the "local (Douala airport) Rwandair representatives know how to handle the situation". At the time of writing this message (2200 Jan 05) I have still not being contacted by other senior managers at Rwandair to whom I reached out. For Rwandair to refuse to rectify a situation in a convenient manner, and instead force my wife and two small children to wait two days for a new flight is beyond appalling. By flying on 07 Jan instead of 05 Jan, we will not arrive in London until the morning of January 08. This means neither my wife nor I will be able to go to work and my children will not be able to attend nursery. I await to see how Rwandair will rectify the situation and await them to contact me.

### "excellent value for money"
Paris-Kigali 31 Dec 2023. Nightflight, on a large A330-200. In Paris, transited between two distant laying terminals took more than 1 hour, despite luggage was already inscribed. Got access to a newer “extime lounge” in Terminal 1. This is a large, pleasurable, exotic lounge with outdoor areas and delicious buffets with well-prepared, tasty, exotic food dishes. At times, these 3rd party lounges surprises positively. Flight on time, not much seat choice possible as the flight was stuffed and quite cramped: New Year was knocking on the door. Onboard, I was well pampered, drinks flowing well, and food were plenty; two hot meals was served on this 8+ hours long flight. I had preordered seafood meal which was not only accommodated, but also tasty, filling, and well-prepared. Other dishes looked also nice. IFE worked OK (small, individual screens), earplugs, pillow, and blanket given. Managed to sleep 1-2 hours. Flight on time. Disembarkation and immigration in Kigali very quick and easy. Luggage arrived as expected although it had been soaked by water on the way. Cheap, promotional ticket, excellent value for money. Miles given. Never had serious issues with this airline after 20 flights. Will I fly again? How can I refuse!

### "Totally dissatisfied"
They changed my seat when I arrived Kigali without even asking my opinion. It's not done anywhere in the world. I bought my ticket since August to travel in December just to make sure I get the seat I want. When I realized and asked her she was rude. Mainly in gate 4, today 29/12/23 transit to Dubai as shown on the boarding pass above. We pay for the services and no should act as if you're flying for free. Totally dissatisfied with this.

### "the experience was very good"
Kigali-Paris 7 Dec. 2023 on A330-200. On time. Rwandair is a small, boutique airline, often very competitive in price and on board service. Ground services varies, main potential issue is a slow response if called upon. Check-in a breeze, easy, opens early. They, surprisingly, agreed to check in and tag my baggages to my final destination in Europe, despite onwards flights were with other airline and on other ticket. What a nice courtesy, easing my transit in Paris tremendously as I just had to shift terminal airside without bothering of my luggage. In Kigali, got access to their nice Dream Lounge, a small oasis to relax at a busy time in the airport. Nice foods, hot snacks, but drinks are getting poor, e.g. wines are undrinkable. Embarked the plane upon a 2 minutes busride was pleasant avoiding a sudden downpour. Flight not full, pleased to be granted 4 seats in a row, stretching out for a good nights sleep. Preordered meal honoured. I got a fired and delicious red snapper (wild catch!) fillet steak. I further tasted other foods offered onboard; they were also good. Plenty of drinks of good quality. 2 meal rounds on a 9 hours flight was appropriate. FAs were marvellous and kind, with a local touch. Plenty of blankets, pillows, and headsets for the IFE which, however, is poor. Deboarding in Paris was quick. In conclusion the experience was very good, not extravagant, but pleasurable and smooth. Extremely good value for money as the ticket was cheap and promotional.

### "good and professional"
Flew Doha-Kigali 29 October after midnight on a worn B737-800. Qatar Airways had issued this award ticket for Rwandair and also issued the boarding pass prior to Doha arrival. Accessed the Gold Lounge in Doha (gate C14); its roomy and hold most facilities. Boarding smooth upon lengthy bus ride. Onboard, neither WiFi nor video entertainment were available. My pre-ordered special meal was not granted. Received apology and reasonable alternatives. Three kinds of hot food was offered; all good, filling, and plenty. Drink rounds were generous, incl. Provision of good wines. I inquired possible access for 3 empty seats in a row as a Dream Miles gold card holder. FAs, who were good and professional, took action on it. Eventually I got them and managed to sleep. Flight on time.

### "seafood meal was delicious"
Kigali-Doha 25 Oct. 2023 on a Boeing 737-800. Night flight, on time. Check-in online is a nuisance as it never works with this airline. However, in airport they managed also to print out following flights boarding passes (with Qatar Airways), which was a relief. Cooperation with Qatar is better now, and lounge access is granted by holding Qatar Airways gold card. That was suspended for a year but has been reinstated. I accessed through my status with Rwandair. The Dream Lounge is Kigali is good and pleasant though not world-class. It supersedes the alternative Pearl lounge by providing panorama view over Kigali. Boarded after a 3 Minutes bus-ride. Flight almost full, I managed to get a free seat next to me. My preordered seafood meal was delicious and delivered to perfection with my name written on the tray. It consisted of a starter (spicy tiger prawns), a main dish (salmon steak), and a chocolate dessert dish. Food on Rwandair is plenty. Four hot meal options was offered! I then also had beef stew to test and complement. Also good and tender. Wines were good and generously poured. The crew onboard are good, call bells answered and requests sought met. Blankets, headsets, and pillows given to everybody. No WiFi. IFE was deeply subpar showing US movies on shared monitors

### "Staff on board talkative, caring, and charming"
Johannesburg-Kigali 19 September 23 on a Boeing 737-700. Afternoon trip with a short stop over in Lusaka. Accessed easily the nice Bidvest lounge in JNB thru my Dream-miles status at the airline. Given 3 seats in the first row after business class section made me doze off. Luggage recheck-in from a previous flight in JNB and check-in was smooth. On time. Special meal accommodated: had requested seafood meal which was good. No red wine, but a few drink options (including white wine) was generously supplied. Lots of food, all tested were good, hot dishes. Luggage handled excellently. Cant fault anything apart from poor/lacking IFE which I did not use anyway. Staff on board talkative, caring, and charming. Rwandair need to be in a bigger alliance for smoother luggage auto-transfers and reciprocal benefits. Their present cooperation with Qatar Airways does not work well.

### "A horrible experience"
A horrible experience no one will ever wish to experience after paying an exorbitant charge. Very poor service. Staffs on board looking very angry and not willing to assist. Seats are very uncomfortable and aircraft itself looks very dirty from inside. The worst of it all is after getting to Dubai all my luggage couldn't be found and there wasn't any one to give an explanation. Only one hostile representative from the airline who wasn't even willing to assist anyone of us as we were over 50 persons with delayed luggages simply ask us to present our selves at the dnata luggage lost area. With all these huddles dnata promise to call once luggage is received but no one ever called and when I called them all they said was luggage is ready you can come collect it as per Rwandair they will not deliver any luggage which is delayed. What an insult to the customer. I will never again try such horrific experience

### "I am very disappointed with the service"
Unsatisfactory performance from Rwandair which has failed to maintain their standard of service under the contract term and conditions. I have traveled with Rwandair for the first time and I am very disappointed with the service. I had an unpleasant and upsetting experience especially traveling with an infant after realising our transit was increased 7 hours. The increase was said to be caused by our flight connection which has been brought forward from 22.30 to 18.00. We were notified by the agency about the flight changes and were only given 12 hours notice to get to Nairobi Airport otherwise we would miss our flight. I had to pay extra money to change my flight from Mombasa to Nairobi just to be there for 18:00 departure. When we arrived at Nairobi we spoke to the manager and she said we are sorry but when you get to Kigali we will accommodate something as you have long hours of traveling with children including an infant. When we arrived at Kigali it was denied that the flight was changed and was forced to wait for 7 hours. Out of our frustration we asked for manager and we’re told they is no manager but assistant manager will come to see you. He turned up after two hours and stated that there was nothing much can be done. Disgraceful he was and un apologetic he did not even acknowledge us. We requested to have hot water for the baby and it took 45 minutes to get. Out of exhaustion and frustration especially after we ran out of baby’s hot water I felt humiliated by Airline and the manager, I have paid for the service and not receiving what I paid for. Very disappointed.

### "We received damaged luggage"
Not Verified |  It was the worst airline I used and I can never recommend to use it. The customer service is worse, flight delayed for more than 4 hours. We received damaged luggage and the airline refused to take responsibility

### "Never again with Rwandair"
Not Verified |  I have never seen such a service. The flight delayed 3 times and then cancelled. They took the passengers to the hotel next to Kigali Airport and said next flight is tomorrow and then it is cancelled too. I am told that tomorrow will have a flight however still waiting in the hotel. Never again with Rwandair even though they are cheaper 10 times than others - headache only. No customer service.

### "they don't think about customer satisfaction"
Not Verified |  Very bad airline, they don't think about customer satisfaction. Just money minded that they use the plane for cargo instead of carrying customers baggage and end up leaving customers things behind that one need to check in a hotel just to wait for 3 weeks to get this bags. Never in my life will me or my generation use this airline again. And they even lie the bags will arrive in a day - very bad.

### "hardly worth the extra costs"
Flew KGL-DOH 12th June 2023 on an award ticket from Qatar Airways. The Boeing 737-800 aircraft was aged but clean and well maintained. Night departure, departed on time. Luggage labelled and transferred correctly. Earlier, I complained to Rwandair that they had deprived lounge access to QR (their partner!) gold card holders. They responded swiftly in Kigali, and status-matched me to gold on their own Dream Miles program enabling me to use their lounges, e.g. in Kigali. Their Dream lounge in Kigali is quite good, though far from World class. Seat choice limited at booking but at check-in everything was possible. Was assigned seat in row 5 just after business class. Later, I negotiated with the cabin crew to grant me one of their two occupied sections (3 seats in a row) though next to toilets in the very rear. Generously, they agreed upon some internal discussion, as they would now have to squeeze while I could stretch out. The crew were all great apart from the arrogant chief purser. I had preordered seafood and was given a large, delicious portion of two salmon steaks. My name and a few details were handwritten on a sticker placed on the cover foil. This “SFML” option is available on many African airlines which supersedes most other carriers. Drink rounds were frequent and wines were of fair quality. IFE was useless as monitors are few and shared; thus no option apart from watching an American teenage movie. Seats are spacious and footrests helps. Pillows, blankets, headsets given to all. Recommended, despite tickets are pricey on this sector. Business class seats are spacious, but just recliners: hardly worth the extra costs compared to economy.

### "poor efforts to retrieve luggage"
Delayed luggage and poor efforts to retrieve luggage. I boarded a Rwandair flight from Dubai to Lagos on 14th May and on arrival my luggage was delayed. Today is 20th May and I am not connected with my luggage despite several calls and emails. I had to purchase most of the items in my box because I was arriving for my marriage. This was after a combined 5 hours delay at Dubai (3 hours after technical issues with plane) and 2 hours in Kigali during the connecting flight.

### "value and warm hospitality"
Flew DOH-KGL March 2023 on a Qatar Airways award ticket. The B737-800 aircraft was aged; interior was at times taped together. Flight on time. Check In and transfers was difficult as Rwandair is less known by legacy carriers and even their QR partner could issue me a BP or transfer the luggage to Rwandair. Onboard, Rwandair delivers good atmosphere, FA’s are plenty, attentive, professional, well-rested, and accommodating, e.g. allowing me for seat changes twice as I eventually found 3 seats in a row. They are generous on supplies throughout this night flight,  at least 4 drink-rounds. Acceptable wines, Heineken beers, and a ½ liter bottle of water was provided to all. Food was again much better than most other airlines in economy: I had my pre-ordered special seafood meal served onboard as the first. More foods, including hot dishes, could be requested. The coffee served was a very good instant coffee from Rwandan “Gorilla’s Company”. Entertainment shared with one tiny monitor shared by 9 seats, no individual option. Headphone provided to those who wanted. Luggage delivered in Kigali 2 days later upon my consent at the gate as time of short transfer had almost elapsed and the incoming Qatar Airways delivering the luggage had refused/failed to relabel it prior to departure. In Kigali, I had to go through PIR reports and return to airport myself and pick the two items. Expensive tickets, but the airline is recommended as they render value and warm hospitality.

### "the worst airline to travel with"
This is the worst airline to travel with. I was pregnant and there was a delay of 8hrs then again from Kigali another 5hrs, they claimed that the flight to Nairobi had already gone. On arrival to Nairobi my suitcase was missing which I later got after 2 weeks of me following up, they were not answering calls or replying to emails, I had to go again to the airport to check what was going on. The worse came on my return as they changed the timing and no communication, still again they couldn't find travel confirmation in the system and the supervisor was saying I cant travel, on asking the question of how I travelled using the same itinerary he couldn't answer, only after calling customer service to confirm my booking was I was allowed to leave with 30 mins before my flight. I think you should work on your customer service and efficiency, that was an eye opener of a mismanaged airline. I will never ever fly or recommend this airline.

### "appalling quality of the food"
Previously I've always flown Kenya Airways on this route with the total journey time being around 15.5 hours. For this trip I decided to give RwandAir a try due of their quicker overall journey times of approx. 2.5 hours less than KA. However, the experience was very disappointing. The lie flat business class seats on the LHR-KGL leg are superb and allow a great nights sleep. The cabin staff are friendly and helpful but unfortunately that's where the good ends. On 2 of the 4 four flights involved in this return trip a Gin and Tonic could not be served due to having 'run out of tonic', on one leg the business class toilet light would not come on when the door was closed leaving it so dark I couldn't see the toilet flush button until I'd opened the door again, on another the toilet ran out of hand drying towels which were not replaced for 2 hours, there are no printed meal menus the cabin crew have the offerings hand written in an exercise book where they record each passenger's choice. Worst of all was the appalling quality of the food. To show how bad the food is I offer this photo of an Egg Florentine for breakfast, just look at that egg yolk! By the time of the third flight I'd given up on eating on the plane opting to eat in the lounge before departure. So much lacking and all at a cost of several $100 more than a KA business class return on the same travel dates.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Worst airline that I have ever flown. Not only did Rwandair change my Cape Town flight to London flight to leaving a day earlier, causing me extra expenses UK side, and the management was incapable of grasping why I was upset. On the flight the staff put on 1 film for the all the passengers and it started half way and on the connecting flight Kigali to Heathrow they put on the same film. Coffee had to be requested and seemed like a big deal to be provided. At Kigali we were bombarded with final calls for our connecting flight leaving in 40 min after the first stage landing. Bottlenecks at poorly staffed passport control and 5 yes 5 boarding pass checks truly added to the nerve jangling attempt to board but again no need to panic. The flight left late in any case. Given 3 suppers meaning woken up again to eat some amorphous mulch. Awful cheap and nasty experience. But actually not that cheap. KLM is a better deal pound for pound. Unless you enjoy stress that you are paying through your nose for.

### "I've emailed again and still had no answer"
Not Verified |  On 20 November 2022 the flight from Kigali to Johannesburg was delayed by several hours causing me (and many other passengers) to miss our onward connections. In Kigali I was assured that an agent would assist me in Johannesburg, but when I arrived their desk was empty. I had to book my own hotel and rebook a new onward flight, all at my expense. I have since tried to contact Rwandair by email (one address bounced back and to the other they never responded), by phone (no answer). Finally I asked a friend in Rwanda to go to the office. I got a number where someone picked up, but they repeatedly hung up on me and ultimately only referred me back to the email. I've emailed again and still had no answer. The delay cost me approximately $500 USD.

### "becoming a pleasure to fly again"
Kigali-Doha 28 Dec. 2022 on a modern B737-800. Ticket issued by the partner airline Qatar Airways (QR): the cooperation is smooth though fragile and not always clear. I checked in in KGL beyond Doha to Bangkok and luggage was kindly inscribed further to Saigon with Vietnam Airlines so I could stay airside in BKK. Denied lounge access in Kigali despite gold status at both QR and BA. That privilege is not clear for economy codeshare flights: this was 1st time out of 4 recent economy flights they have rejected me free lounge access. Security checks when going to gate was nitty gritty and they took every item out of bags. Boarding by foot, 200 m, was a breeze. Given an exit seat while boarding but took the liberty to choose instead the last empty row to stretch out during the night. Flight on time. Onboard, the FAs are stunning, energetic, observant, polite, and truly caring. Call-bells answered throughout. My preordered seafood meal was provided with precision, ease, and care. It was a big portion with wildcatch ocean fish - delicious for economy travel. With pleasure, I also tried other hot dishes offered. Drinks and food generously provided, apparently ad libitum. Food filling and more or less on par with SWISS and KLM business class. It is becoming a pleasure to fly again, but I can fault missing IFE (shared screens/no sound) and WiFi. This aircraft type is extremely noisy. Landed in Doha for tedious embarkation by bus to terminal.

### "landed safely with 8 hours delay"
After 4 hours of delay, our flight was diverted due to the weather conditions. We waited 3 hours in the plane in Entebbe and they merged two other flights with ours. Of course, no communication. Some elderly passengers were panicked and unaware of the situation. The crew did not care explaining and when faced with complaints, they did not hesitate to mention that Rwandair was the second best airline on the continent. With insisting customers, they made it clear that criticism was an insult to their country, Rwanda. We all landed safely with 8 hours delay.

### "worst airline I have ever come across"
Worst flying experience ever! This is the worst airline I have ever come across. (And I haven’t even boarded the plane yet) If you are trying to make a trip to see loved ones you haven’t seen since before the pandemic or trying to make it to an important appointment on time (I am trying to do both) DO NOT fly Rwanda air! The customer service personnel are rude (they hung up on me several times, and they choose what to listen to and what to leave out- I was calling internationally to make what should have been a simple ticket change. They claimed I had already made a change to my ticket and therefore had to pay for the change (A lie)- Even with proof provided they chose to ignore this and charged me the cost of another ticket! Furthermore, days before my flight from DC to Harare, Zimbabwe, I received a weird text message from what I assumed was the airline, saying one of the legs of my flight was cancelled- The Kigali to Harare leg. (This is a problem because I have an important appointment to get too upon arrival). I asked the airline if the change was real because I had not received any emails confirming this change, what’s more they are saying the change is real and I will be stuck at my layover for 48 hours! My flight is tomorrow December 9 2022 and because of this change it will take me 4 days to get home. That’s a good chunk of my trip gone! I have been trying to contact the airline for the past few days, losing out on sleep trying to call them in their time zone during business hours. I am very frustrated because management will not help me and frankly do not care. I can clearly see there are flights to Zimbabwe on the day I was supposed to arrive at my destination. I am usually not one to write bad reviews but I want to put this out there to warn people not to gamble their travel plans on this airline. No one will accommodate you. You are on your own! I am never booking them again and will advise anyone considering them to support other airlines that will treat you like a human being in the very least.

### "customer service was practically non existent"
Flight was supposed to leave on 04 December at 20:30, but delayed due to some technical issues. Passengers were not informed of this until they had been waiting at the gate for several hours. By 00:30, we were then informed that the flight had been cancelled; that were been taken to a hotel and everything will be sorted the following; that we will continue our journey, especially those of us who had connecting flights. I understood that. The plane had a problem. However, the following day, things were worse! When we got to the airport, while trying to check in again, the majority of us were told that our names were not in the system! How can that be? Kigali was not helpful at all, the customer service was practically non existent; nothing was working.

### "return flight was then postponed by 3 days"
Not Verified |  Flight leaving Heathrow was delayed by an hour. This time was made up in the air. Flight leaving Kigali was delayed by 2 hours for unknown reasons, and then further delays during the refuel in Lusaka, causing me to miss my arranged transport in Johannesburg. The return flight was then postponed by 3 days for unstated reasons, causing me to miss work. Do not use Rwandair unless you have good travel insurance. Next time I shall pay the higher cost for a better airline.

### "Overall service was good"
Not Verified |  About the service is been so wonderful in helping us navigate the checking process. Food wise need to improve more. Travelling with a special child is always challenging but with the help of staff it’s been less stressful, and for that I’m forever grateful. Overall service was good.

### "customer care onboard was very pleasant"
Lusaka to Kigali 12 October 2022. Few days before departure I contacted the airline’s office in Lusaka as the flight appeared not to be to sold anymore and hardly could be full. They answered back within 1 hour and gave detailed confirmed, entire itinerary (incl. coming flights). Check-in counters opened pleasantly early, 3½ hour prior departure, so no queues or waiting time. The man at counter advised on seating and showed me configuration and options on his computer. We selected the best options, though I was later further upgraded onboard to have the most spacious seat in economy. Security, health documentation, immigration took less than 10 Minutes. Their partnership with Qatar rendered me access to Pearl lounge in the terminal. There was some discussion whether I was qualified, but in 5 Minutes after some photocopying, they let me in. The lounge is 3rd party, and acceptable with Wi-fi, hot foods, wines and cold beers. Onboard, my preordered special meal though I had to remind them, and it took some time to avail it. Drinks and customer care onboard was very pleasant, nothing was too much, but it took a lot of time as the FAs discussed and recommended drinks to almost every passenger. IFE was only a flight monitor, but the music channels offered a lot. Had to use own headphones. No WiFi, old aircraft, but well maintained. Good announcements from pilots. Noisy aircraft, this B737-800. Flight on time, we arrived 15 Minutes earlier than scheduled. Luggage arrived before I even passed immigration. DreamMiles to their FFP was given me after just 1 day after landing. Recommended.

### "Excellent service"
Excellent service starting from the booking of my ticket - off and on the flight. Really good food. very comfortable seats and keep time. Perfect landing. I will definitely travel with Rwandair again. Airport lounge in Kigali is spacious, nice and quiet and very clean.

### "impressed by the consistency"
Third time using Rwandair business class to Kigali in the last 5 years and I am quite impressed by the consistency and professionalism of the airline. Recently, I had to deal with the customer service department and was even more impressed by their professionalism : emails answered promptly and perceived issues explained and dealt with efficiently. Nice to see an African airline punching above its weight in this business.

### "FA’s are very friendly and caring"
Flew Doha to Lusaka via Kigali 10-11 Sept. 2022 on two different Boeing 737 versions. This, in conjunction with QR from Bangkok. Qatar Airwaysis new partner of Rwandair and it functions despite some hiccups on ticketing, pricing, FFP. Partnership with Qatar Airways is incomplete and unclear: e.g. issued tickets are only partly compatible and manageable on both airlines. Both flights on time. Very noisy aircrafts, very limited IFE. Food very good, as always. Special meal delivered to perfection. Additional meals were offered and I tested them as also being good, and well cooked. FA’s are very friendly and caring, all stunning elegant, more than 6 feet tall, well rested, humorous, and confident. Transfer in Kigali smooth, was granted access to Pearl lounge after a short discussion (de facto, its not clear whether a QR gold card should give you access as most QR-frills do not apply for their partners like smaller, non-OneWorld airlines. Luggage: no issues. Flights on time. IFE poor but present. Manage to change FFP from Qatars’ Priv. Club to Rwandairs’ Dream-Miles at the gate in Doha to maximise earnings on both programs. The airlines’ frequent flyer programs are reciprocal only within limitations, thus I had to split the Mileage earnings to 2 programs according to sectors.

### "checked baggage did not arrive"
Worst flying experience I have had. Hand luggage was weighed prior to boarding, and a lot of hand luggage was checked-in right before boarding. There was no air conditioning in the flight until 30 minutes after take-off. Even after that the entire flight was very warm. No COVID protocol was followed on board with most passengers wearing masks under their noses and some not wearing one at all. Our checked baggage did not arrive in Kigali. Waited for 3 hours to enter the airport and collect my luggage when the next flight arrived 2 days later, and missed work because of this. Never flying with RwandAir again.

### "just throw the extra weight to trash"
Not Verified |  I was flying from Dubai to Gabon and my boyfriend and I had one carryon bag each. Once we got to the departing time at the gate, they begin to weight everybody carryons bag and asked people to pay for the extra weight. They told my boyfriend and I we have 5kg extra each and we need to pay $500 for it. At the cashier we gave them our credit card to pay and the refused saying they only take cash. We didn’t have cash so they asked us to just throw the extra weight to trash if we want to fly. We were in one of the most developed city in the world and we couldn’t use our credit card. We even ask them if they can keep our bags so we can pay cash for it once we get to Gabon because we couldn’t find cash right now at the airport we already spent our daily cash withdrawals limit. They refused all our proposals and asked us to pay cash or trash our staff. At the end they were about to close the gate and we had no choice but the leave our bags there and take the flight. Once we got to Kigali we asked to speak to an agent and he said they don’t deal with issues regarding Dubai and there is nothing they can do about it. Same thing in Libreville.

### "It was such a horrible experience"
Nairobi to Kigali, then Kigali to Dubai. First of all the Flight from Nairobi to Kigali (WB 403) arrived 30 minutes late. At the Nairobi first check in counter, nobody informed me about filling up a Covid passenger locator form online which was request at the second check in counter. Upon boarding the flight it was so uncomfortable journey. Cabin crews served snacks and drinks but not even a wet wipe was provided to passengers despite the whole world facing a pandemic. Upon arriving at Kigali to connect my flight to Dubai (WB 304) I found all passengers having boarded and the flight was almost departing, an inconvenience that was caused by delayed flight from Nairobi to Kigali but was not communicated to the flight to Dubai and no one apologized for the inconveniences. It was such a horrible experience.

### "you will be utterly disappointed"
I have the utmost disappointment, anger and frustration over the service of Rwandair. I flew from South Africa on 23rd December 2020 to Tanzania. I arrived at the airport for check in 3 hours prior to flight departure and checked in successfully. Upon arrival at Kilimanjaro, Tanzania i was informed that my luggage had not arrived and was left in South Africa and that i should find a way to go back to the airport the next day at night at 20h00 to collect my bag. The first problem with this is that they said the system was showing that i had checked in only one piece of luggage whereas i had checked in 2 pieces. On 24th i called to confirm before heading to the airport and was told that they located both bags but one of my bagts was sent to Nigeria and the other was in South Africa. Everyday they say my bags will be sent to my final destination on the next day but this does not happen. Neither do the staff seem to care about rectifying their negligence. It is the 27th tomorrow and i still have not received my bags, i had to cancel Christmas plans and spend Christmas without my belongings or presents for family and friends. I would urge anyone not to use this airline if you have any choice whatsoever, you will be utterly disappointed! Even the inflight movie sound could not play properly, it kept on breaking up and then switching from English to French sentence after the other.

### "Cabin crew polite and efficient"
Flew Kigali to Dar es Salaam (on 8th November 2020) and back a week later. Convenient flying times (mid-day out, and afternoon home). Both flights were on the same aircraft, a De Havilland DHC-8, called “Dash 8”. This is a propeller, which is small (80 seats?) and noisy. Not many passengers on the outbound, but full on homebound. Cheap, promotional ticket (250 USD) with generous luggage allowance, 2 x 23 kg plus handluggage. Both flights on time. Free seat selection at check-in. Special seafood meal accommodated both ways and extra food provided on request. Check-in smooth and Cabin crew polite and efficient. A short stop in Kilimajaro airport on the way back went smooth. The Covid tests requirements (both ends, and again on arrival Kigali, total 3 tests!) are a nightmare and costly (150 USD); further comes 1-day quarantine at arrival in Rwanda, but one cannot fault the airline for this.

### "waste of time and money"
Not Verified | Horrible customer service. Rwandair cancelled my return flight from Harare to Kigali due to the Covid-19 pandemic. When I contacted them to figure out next steps the only option they gave me was that they would reroute my ticket to a departure point that they are still flying from so I can connect to my final destination. Essentially, I have to buy another ticket on another airline to fly from Harare (to Nairobi for example), and then use the Rwandair ticket to fly from Nairobi to Kigali. Absolutely ridiculous! When I asked for a voucher or a refund they told me that their system is frozen. I try sending following up emails and they were ignored. Don't fly this airline if you can avoid it. Absolute waste of time and money.

### "I was the loser"
Rwandair Business CAN-MUM-KGL-LUN-JNB return in February 2020. Flight cancelled due to Rwandan Government’s Decision to suspend flights from China. They corresponded slowly and offered rebooking with ET which was risky and was 2 days later leaving me in China. I suggested much better alternative with Thai and Kenya Airways which would fit me perfectly. After some days of discussion they agreed and I rearranged positioning flights. Less than 24 hours before departure they declined to pursue their own, new rebooking due to “ticket stock issues” (= no interline agreement with KQ). I then had to purchase a last Minute ticket myself on the suggested routing (confirmed by Rwandair-China in-country manager). They now refuse to refund that ticket which costed me 1750 USD. Small airlines cannot cope well with serious issues. They suggest to refund the original ticket which I cannot accept as it would leave me stranded in Africa. Original ticket bought 5 months earlier as [promotional business] and I intended not to forsake it. We were still negotiating in Kigali and I filed a case to pursue refund relentlessly. It was a tug of war. Eventually they just refunded the ticket but I was the loser as I had to buy new tickets in last moment for thrice the price of the ticket they suspended.

### "kind, attentive and friendly"
Not Verified |  Kigali to London. Comfortable, quiet cabin with loads of room and a long lie-flat bed. Crew were kind, attentive and friendly throughout flight. Easily the best way to get to Rwanda from UK. What a refreshing change to see smiles and laughter in the galley! I recommend for a genuine and lovely Rwandan welcome.

### "never fly with Rwandair"
Not Verified |  This was our first time flying Rwandair and had chosen the airline due to a combination of directness of flight and price for the Lusaka - Tel Aviv route. Booking went well. Then on Thursday 8 January, the day of the flight, we received word 4 hours before our flight when our bags were packed and we were preparing to be at the airport 3 hours early that the second leg of our flight was canceled. The customer service rep explained they could put us on another flight on Friday 9 January arriving later Saturday 10 January. I explained that this was not possible as we had to be in Tel Aviv by 9 January as we were booked into a hotel with our tour starting early 10 January. Obviously this next hour was stressful but the Rep was able to find a flight using Turkish Airlines flights TK606 Kigali to Istanbul and TK786 Istanbul to Tel Aviv that would get us to Tel Aviv later on Friday 9 January. We were relieved and thankful for the kindness and hard work shown by Rwandair's Rep  in making our tour possible. Upon arriving at Kenneth Kaunda Airport everything seemed to be going well until we entered the boarding area, only to find out the flight, WB107, was delayed. We were told the flight was delayed by 1 hour, then the 1 hour delay became 2 hours and then 2 became over 3 hours. Frustrated and tired we finally left Lusaka. This delay put pressure on us to make our connecting flight out of Kigali. Fortunately Kigali airport staff were able to rush us through security and we made our connecting flight after running through security. We were exhausted and stressed by all the problems but thankful to arrive in Tel Aviv in time to enjoy our tour. But things were to be even worse on our return flight. We were to leave Ben Gurion airport on Rwandair WB503 at 00:01 Friday 24 January. Again this flight was delayed by 1 hour. But given what had happened when flying with Rwandair to Tel Aviv on 8 January we were not surprised. We also knew that we had a 4 hour window between flights. We arrived in Kigali and were prepared to leave on flight WB106 at 10:10. As we waited in the boarding area it became apparent that we would be delayed again! This meant that except for our connection through Turkish Airlines every Rwandair flight going to Tel Aviv and coming home was delayed. Communication in Kigali was not good. Initially we were told not to worry as the delay would be 1 hour. But after much miscommunications and frustration our flight was canceled. Some passengers were angry and others crying. Finally we were told the aircraft was grounded due to technical difficulties and we were rescheduled to fly out on WB112 at 23:10. We were thankful that Rwandair decided to calm things by sending us to a hotel so we could rest, freshen up and have supper. But we couldn't believe that even after all this our last flight was delayed by about 1 hour. We fly Toronto to Lusaka four times each year. We have done this for the last 8 years. We have flown many different airlines with only 1 incidence of a delay. But our experience with Rwandair has taught us a this lesson - never fly with Rwandair as you will never know if they will be able to keep their commitment to get you to your destination in a timely manner. I want to be clear - We had no issues with the on flight service and would recommend Rwandair in this regard. But being able to keep time and deliver passengers to their intended destinations on time is of first importance.

### "first and last experience"
Nairobi to Kinshasa via Kigali. This was my first and last experience. The plane seems consistently late for boarding. 30% of passengers had to file a baggage claim and over 50 bags sent on our flight were left unclaimed. They were for previous passengers. T Still awaiting my bag 3 days later!

### "Very disappointing experience"
Johannesburg to Lagos via Kigali. My first time flying with Rwandair  was a worst experience ever that l received from any airline. On the 21 December 2019 the aircraft had to leave at 3am we ended up leaving OR Tambo airport in JHB at 6:30am. Delays do happen but what was so disappointing not even an sms was sent to notify us about the delay. What was worst as you check in nobody tells you about the delay, as soon as they finished checking us in we were told there was a 3 hour delay. Would it has been more professional if we were told before check in.Besides me and my 2 kids l had another 7 family members on board that l convinced that lets try Rwandair for the first time. Finally we left, as we were collecting out luggage in Lagos some of our luggage was left in JHB, l was on my way to Benin City which costed me to come back the following day for my luggage, all they say we are sorry about the delay. We stayed like fools at OR Tambo. We pay for our fares we need to be treated with dignity and respect. When we finally got to Kigali we were rushed with the announcement this is the final call for Lagos passengers,  they could have made arrangements with customs that we go through first because they knew about the delay way early. The immigration slips were not even supplied during flight from OR Tambo we wasted more time completing that upon arrival in Kigali. Very disappointing experience.

### "Horrible flight experience"
Not Verified | Kigali to Nairobi. Horrible flight experience. The flight was delayed in JHB and then on arriving at Kigali, we had to wait for another 4hrs. Sad that no one seemed to care about the customers. We had kids and nothing at the airport is kids friendly. On arrival to Nairobi, the flight supervisor was so mean to my wife while trying to help our infant. Really disappointed as flying via Rwandair was my favorite route. Now am dreading my return flight to JHB via Kigali again.

### "Worst ever flight"
Cape Town to Tel Aviv via Kigali. Worst ever flight - first and last time with Rwanda air. Delays of 2- 6 hours unexplained. No customer care at that delay time. Broke luggage - thoroughly broken and missing parts. Old plane, broken seat,no entertainment beside a Pakistani movie in a loop. Food is an Insult for airline food. Staff is friendly but need lots of training. Never again.

### "This airline is sickening"
Nairobi to Accra via Kigali. True to the word cheap is expensive. First of all they lost a wedding gift and hence causing a great inconvenience to my plans. This is after crew at Kigali insisted that it had to go to the luggage cabin, Kigali to Accra, yet we had carried it perfectly fine as hand luggage from Nairobi. Second, someone broke into my suitcase damaging it and if that is not enough you have the audacity to attach a security check ticket. They broke my designer perfume, begs the question whether the check was based on security purposes or pure malice. This airline is sickening and the last time I’m using it. Totally disappointed client.

### "don't use this airline"
Dubai to Douala via Kigali. I regret ever flying with them. I booked to travel and something came up and I have to cancel my trip. They said they can pay me back but I can open the ticket and use it in future which I did. Now I want to use it they are asking for more money more than the total money I paid before. My advice to people out there is this don't use this airline.

### "Horrible experience"
London to Kinshasa via Kigali. More than 2 hours late with hard to explain poor customer service. We have been lied to multiple times about our departure. Our bags were intentionally left in Kigali and the number provided for lost property is not answering. We found other people’s bags on the floor at the airport in Kinshasa. I have to admit that RwandAir is a company that I won’t ever fly unless it is the only company. Horrible experience

### "awful and disappointing"
Dubai to Nairobi via Kigali. What an awful and disappointing thing it was my first time to travel with Rwandair from Dubai to Kenya I arrived and I was looking and waiting my luggage for more than 3 hours and even after waiting it was all in vain. I called the main office and the gentleman who picked my calls had the guts to say there is no way he can help me I called several times and different people all they could do its to refer me to others and those that were also referred to me dint help it's so annoying I used a lot of my phone balance and dint receive any updates I also wrote an email and it ended up unreplied I have been trying to call the office even today morning but it seems something happened in between my flight and I would really have appreciated if someone could have told me am not allowed to carry any baggage rather than buying my things and they checked them in and they dint send them with me questions are what kind of services do you offer if the company cannot take the issues of their clients seriously right now I have missed a lot of things I was supposed to be doin . Before I forget thanks to cabin crews all the way from Dubai they were so nice and kind so all the good things I had seen was spoiled at the last minute. I wish I knew I shouldn't have spent my money buying items which was not delivered due to carelessness of the company. I would really have appreciated if you could have informed everyone on board that they wont get there luggage

### "my ticket was changed multiple time"
Dubai to Johannesburg with Rwandair. I had the longest flight ever, my ticket was changed multiple times, the ticket itself did not say we stopped in Lushaka as well. My luggage was lost with presents in for my family and have not heard anything about retrieval.

### "suitcases had been broken"
Hubby and I travelled via Rwandair for the first time from Johannesburg to Lagos via Kigali, upon arriving at Lagos, discovered our suitcases had been broken with all our valuables stolen. Made complains but no positive response yet.

### "did not have vegetarian meals for us"
Three of us booked with RwandAir from Johannesburg to Brussels via Kigali. We pre-booked vegetarian meals and received confirmation from the airline that our meals were booked, but they did not have vegetarian meals for us on either flight. When we arrived in Brussels, four out of our five checked bags were missing, and there was delay and confusion with getting our fragile/oversized item. We were also informed that RwandAir does not deliver our bags to us, which is absolutely unacceptable as the negligence was on their part, yet we are expected to travel back from Leuven to Brussels to collect our bags. As an international student relocating to Belgium for studies, the contents of our luggage are all vital for relocation and relocating without them (even temporary while waiting for the bags to be found) is extremely difficult and expensive.

### "Airline appears to be fairly professional"
Flew KGL-NBO on 14/6-19 on a well maintained B737-700. The ticket was reissued by Kenya Airways several weeks in advance due to a cancelled flight further ahead in my itinerary. They changed the flight to WB for smoother connection. Unfortunately, this night-flight (departing 1 min. after midnight) had an annoying stop-over in BJM at 1:30 a.m. where one has remain on the plane. The stop was suddenly changed to be in in EBB instead of BJM at the time of check-in. This happened without any reasoning or clear information. It extends the duration by 2-3 hours and deprived me of any decent sleep. This is not professional and can have implications for a number of passengers. Check-In online worked out. Thus, I entered airport and accessed the transit easily. Onboard, drinks offered inc. acceptable wines. Fabricated, useless snack provided on 1st leg while on 2nd leg a cold sandwich was given. Seafood meal (sandwich) requested and given. Flight on time. FAs were plenty and kind and caring. Airline appears to be fairly professional but could need more internationally exposed FAs. No IFE. Granted mileage for their FFP program, Dream Miles. Codeshare with KQ for onward travel.

### "my luggage was misplaced"
Not Verified |  The food quality is not good enough. Seat inside aircraft  with no comfort. I arrived with no luggage, my luggage was misplaced by the crew and they told me that we will deliver it after 2-3 days - if i need it urgent then I need to collect with no compensation by company, which lead to very disappointing situation. This will be my last travel with Rwandair.

### "Simply a horrific experience"
Rwandair cancelled and rescheduled our flights multiple times and did not reissue our tickets - which made it difficult for operating carrier (ET) to find us in the system and check us in. After RW assured us that they have fixed our tickets, they again made changes to our returning flight from Kigali to Addis without informing us. We purchased a direct flight from Kigali to Addis departing at 16:20 and without informing us prior, they changed the flight to 15:15 (one hour earlier) with a stop in Bujumbura. When we arrived at the Kigali airport, Rwanda airline representatives were not transparent with us about the stop in Bujumbura and the change of the flight times. When we wanted to receive some answers about the flight time changes and the sudden stop in Bujumbura the airport staff became rude and tried blaming us for this situation (this discussion took place at 15:09 - and they seriously wanted us to proceed through security and immigration) when the departure time was 15:15. When I asked them if the aircraft is still there and if it will wait for us, they did not give me an answer. Hence we were not able to board the flight because of their failure to inform us about the flight cancellation and rescheduling - incredibly enough they did not want to take responsibility and in all seriousness told us that we had to purchase a new ticket for $900 per person! After holding us at the airport for 9 hours without eating and drinking we spoke with airport security who finally decided that the airline was in the wrong and pressured the Rwandair staff to put us on a new flight (which was their responsibility all along). Rwanda Air is incredibly incompetent and unprofessional in providing customer support and service and have absolutely no training in how to treat their customers. Throughout our nine horrific hours at the airport, we were harassed by Rwandair staff - and called "liars who wanted to miss our flight" by the head of Customer Relations himself. They put us into an incredibly bad situation and took no responsibility until they were forced to by airport security. In addition they lost our luggage (it never left Mumbai and it is nowhere to be found), which still has not arrived in Addis. Do not take this airline, because you do not want to be stuck in their hands when they make mistakes and are unwilling to correct them. Simply a horrific experience.

### "good seat sizes and leg room"
Gatwick to Dar es salaam via Kigali. Plane has a good cabin configuration with good seat sizes and leg room in economy. Configuration at the rear of aircraft allows a large number of 2 seat, allowing easy/more access. Boarding at LGW was quick and easy. Cabin staff are efficient and happilyarrange passengers with infants and mobility to be in better seats/near bathrooms. Meals were very good, surprisingly, as the presentation was not great, it was a very bland looking tray when it arrived, but the food was very tasty, basic, in my case Salad, Chick curry and a chocolate sponge. On arrival at Kigali I was informed of a 6 hour delay to my connecting flight to Dar es Salaam, these are the moments that test airlines, how do they deal with this. In the same breath and informing me of the delay, I was informed we have a shuttle bus waiting downstairs to take you to a local 4* star hotel. Escorted to Immigration, front of que, a 10 second stamp of passport, to be whisked to the Hotel in 25 minutes to have a welcome juice/water, room keys and the wi-fi code. The room was a suite, toiletries and a note of what time lunch will be and pick up time back to the airport. Refreshed and fed, back 6 hours later, to have an uneventful connection to Dar es Salaam. Once again a bland looking lunch served on the plane, but again, it was very tasty, full of flavours. Kigali Airport, small, but works efficiently, the most armed Police I ever seen inside and surrounding an airport, but everything moves at a steady pace despite the numerous rigorous security checks.

### "excellent services"
Not Verified | Entebbe to Dubai via Kigali. With great pleasure, I want to thank Rwandair for their excellent services. While I was on a flight from Kigali to Dubai, I started feeling nauseated and having a stomach upset at the same time feeling weak. A member of staff was called to see what could have been wrong with me. She made me green tea mixed with lemon that helped within a couple of minutes. Putting that aside, the way she handled me and extended great concern seeing the condition I was in, only this was mind-blowing. She kept checking on me from time to time and made sure I was fine. Even when we landed in Dubai she made sure to ask if I was feeling ok.

### "my first choice of carrier"
Gatwick to Kigali. The best way to get around Africa due to the young fleet of planes that is well maintained. Exceptional staff. Rwandair is always my first choice of carrier. Kigali is my favorite stopover city as well. I am glad they will be expanding with flights to New York soon.

### "our baggage has not arrived"
Mumbai to Kigali via Dar es Salaam. The staff service was good and the flight in good condition, that's the only good part. When we landed in Dar es salaam we came to know that our baggage has not arrived and we would have to wait longer. Not only that non of the passengers who were traveling with us from Mumbai received theirs. On further enquiry came to know that they have failed to board the luggage of all the passengers traveling from Mumbai. Really disappointed. It's been a day and since not got any information regarding the same. Will never travel with Rwandair nor would I recommend this flight to anyone. Customer service and communication pathetic.

### "disaster for night flights"
Flew on a narrowbody B737-800 at midnight on 2 March 2019 from Kigali to Dubai. Direct flight (in contrast to fly opposite direction). This aircraft has no lie flat seats which is a disaster for night flights. I purchased the ticket in faith of their refurbished A330, but they made an equipment change obviously due to low load. Check-in online is a joke and waste of time: after filling some 7 pages with info online they eventually laconically inform that “check-in must be done in Airport”. Worst: landed in T2 in Dubai, which is a messy LCC terminal and fought my way to T1 for onward flights. Homepage misleading and systematically hide info on booking class. Even their most expensive bis-ticket give only few miles which furthermore only can be used on Rwandair. Lounge in Kigali is fine but they have blindfolded all windows with tape to deprive passengers any view of tarmac which is painful, embarasing, and a misunderstood security issue. Luggage checked in to next destination only, thus had to fight again in Dubai for further luggage transfers. These 6 issues deprives rating 6 points of 10, leaving us with a poor score of 4. On the brighter side is the nice atmosphere onboard, great traditional Rwandan decorated interior in business cabin: FA’s were great and well caring. Champagne and welcome drinks provided. Menu cards and drink lists provided. Sparse supply, e.g. only one kind of beer and only two dishes offered for supper (only 2 options). The food was only passable but plenty. Breakfast of poor quality. Punctual airline with stunning, tall statured FAs. However, their flight equipment is limited and they are not attached to any airline alliance, thus miles earning is only for their Dream Miles Program, which is very stingy with miles even for full fare business tickets. Will chose Kenya Airways and Ethiopian in future despite detours (over NBO or ADD) as they are considerably cheaper and mostly have a better product.

### "Amazing cabin crew"
Amazing cabin crew, let me just say. Very attentive, funny and helpful. Very rarely do I see the cabin crew, literally, helping every single person to put their baggage in the overhead compartments. Very friendly wake up calls for food or landing! Very efficient with handing out meals and drinks, and didn't run out of anything, that I know of, on the flights. Seats were spacious and comfy (easily comparable to other big-name airlines). The Rwanda airport isn't impressive, but does offer free wifi and it seems like all connecting flights are only there for a very short layover (mine were 1 hour 19 minutes and the other 2 hours). Prompt boarding times! And every flight we landed roughly 10-30 minutes earlier then we were supposed to. I don't love the flight route, due to there being so many stops along the way, but definitely budget friendly, so can't complain over all.

### "cabin crew were attentive"
Dubai to Libreville via Kigali. Was comfortable with flight as cabin crew were attentive and available. Clean and arranged flights all the way through. Didn't enjoy transfer at Kigali however as Airport was not as organized as flight.

### "Poor communication all round"
Harare to Gatwick via Kigali. Worst airline ever. Problems after drones at Gatwick in Dec 2018, some of us were more or less chased away and others later put in hotels. No back up planes to clear backlog which meant we flew 4 days late with little communication. Flying back to UK - stuck on a hot plane which was being fixed for 2hrs, no water given after asking, terrible comms. The sad and most incompetent thing is eventually we were asked to disembark only to be told to sit down after getting our bags from cabin compartments. The only apology for this or news of why we were delayed was on reaching Kigali. Rushed to catch connecting flight - cant understand why the security gate is where it is for connecting customers at the airport. Arrived - our fragile parcel was well looked after but our bags were ripped, dirty (very dirty, oily dirty) and unrecognisable. Poor entertainment choice especially for kids. Poor communication all round. They will get you there but you will be very frustrated to the extent of being grateful that you made it yo destination. Never ever will i use this airline.

### "I'd recommend this airline"
Cape Town to Harare. Rwandair recently started flying directly from Cape Town to Harare and the convenience made me book them. This airline is surprisingly good; an up and coming African airline which we'll be sure to hear more of in future. The cabin interior is spotless and all staff friendly and efficient. The inflight catering and entertainment are average. I've flown this route a few times now and they seem to have a problem with delays of over an hour each time on this route whenever I've flown. Advance communication of delays were lacking each time. Overall, I'd recommend this airline if you're on a budget and don't mind the occasional delay.

### "Worst airline ever"
Cape Town to Harare. Worst airline ever. Flight was delayed by 4 hours. Later heard from friends that their previous flights with this airline on the same route had also been delayed, so it seems to be the standard with this airline. Happy to say I will never fly this airline again anywhere and would say to anyone who would like to know, fly at your own inconvenience. Extremely disappointed and lost customer. I give them a well earned zero out of ten.

### "Aircraft very well maintained"
Aircraft very well maintained. Terrible to make transit transfers in DXB, had to struggle in the middle of the night with busses from T1 to T2 where there is always check in chaos and no signage nor separation of airlines. Had to insist on lounge access as the check-in counters could not care less about passengers. Was granted access to a sub par lounge in T2 called Marhaba. The bar sections was for smokers also so air was hazy. Poor boarding services: at gate on time but then shuttled around by bus for ages after waiting in the bus for 20 Minutes before it took off. Onboard nice atmosphere, great decoration of business cabin, great FAs, and good good caring. However, no menu cards nor drink list - sparse supply. Food acceptable and plenty. IFE worked well. Seats very nice and spacious, I slept well. Got dinner at night and got a full breakfast from Mombasa to Kigali. Good airline, though not attached to any alliance. Ticket not cheap, otherwise could have rated 8/10.

### "not a bad airline"
Not Verified |  
The routing was Nairobi-Entebbe-Kigali-Lusaka-Johannesburg. Crazy itinerary however a good deal in terms of ticket price. First flight from Nairobi to Kigali was satisfactory. A330 from Kigali to Lusaka and Jo'burg offered lots of comfort with hot breakfast and hot snack served later. IFE was pretty pathetic on flights where it was available and otherwise non existent. On the return a terrible sandwich was served followed by a hot dinner. Overall not a bad airline, the cabin crew were very friendly. However ground services staff seem to be overwhelmed (especially when we flew the A330). Check-in was very slow both in Nairobi and in Johannesburg (Was told I was not on the list when arrived at JNB for Check-in!) and all except two departures were slightly delayed without any explanation or any information given. Good airline if you're trying to save money.

### "airline could be a good option"
Gatwick to Kigali return, with a stop in Brussels each way during which you stay on the plane. I was astonished at how good this airline was given prior experiences of African airlines, it is as good as the better European airlines. The planes seem to be pretty new (ours was a 2 year old Airbus A330). The seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room even in economy. The food was  pleasant which is always a surprise on any airline in economy. The cabin crew were very friendly and professional. The return flight was on time and whilst there was a short hour delay outbound this was due to the ongoing air traffic control shambles in Europe this summer, not the airline. The only hiccup was a lost bag on the way back but this was resolved efficiently by the airline despite a complex onward itinerary - and the Gatwick luggage desk said it was extremely rare to have lost bag on this airline suggesting it is not a systemic issue. A final point, although we were not connecting in Kigali, many passengers were. They appear to hold onward flights in the event of delays so as a connecting option for various African destinations this airline could be a good option.

### "never ever fly Rwandair"
Johannesburg to Abuja via Kigali. I was supposed to fly as per my boarding passes attached, we were notified that there is a flight delay and we won't make our connection, a promise was made that our bags will be offloaded and brought back to us. We waited and nothing happened, our business trip is compromised as all my presentation notes and suits are in the luggage, not to mention that the host had to make other arrangements as we were a day late. I am very dissaponted at how Rwandair treats its customers, we've made several communications to no avail. I will never ever fly Rwandair nor recommend it to anyone ever.

### "crew were very friendly"
The RwandaAir cabin crew were very friendly, informative, and could go the extra mile to ensure that the traveler's needs are met. The captain as well was welcoming. The food was enjoyable too, and people could be explained about the available choices before being served.

### "overall experience was just satisfactory"
Not Verified |  
Flew Cape Town to Harare with Rwandair. The flight attendants were cheerful and very helpful. The space inside the plane was excellent and so was entertainment. However, my checking in was a total nightmare. Spent almost 30 minutes trying to check in. As if the attitude wasn't enough, I was travelling with a minor and had a lot of bags, the lady kept asking me to remove my bags from the scale and put them back on the floor. She did not know how to check in a minor hence kept calling her supervisor who was busy chit chatting. She miscalculated my excess lagguage only for me to correct her (she did not even use a calculator). Asked me if I wanted to pay with cash or card and I told her card, only for her to say 'we only take cash'. Why didn't you just say so in the 1st place?. As if that is not enough, she spent a good 2 minutes asking me questions like "Are you sure you can identify the goods in your bags, are these your bags, are there any fragile material? How can I be checking in bags that are not mine and if there was something fragile that needed proper handling dont you think I would have told you? Late Departure also. Since its a new route I think the overall experience was just satisfactory.

### "really happy with both flights"
I flew from Kigali to Lusaka (Return) and I was really happy with both flights. The service was efficient despite the flights being quite busy and the food served was good. Flights left and arrived on time. I would happily recommend Rwandair for travel within Africa and beyond.

### "I feel so defrauded"
Arusha to Kigali via Dar es Salaam. I arrived to Kilimanjaro Airport at 4p.m, after taking a bus because if I waited my belatedly flight I had never been arrived on time to Kigali. When I arrived they said me that my flight to Kigali is cancelled. They didn't know how long. I sat down and after 30min without information I spoke with a lot of people who works in the airport but not with personal of Rwandair because after they said me waiting they disappeared. Now finally, I will take other flight with another airline to Dar Salam where I used to search someone who wants give me another ticket to flight to Kigali. They said me that I need to tell in Dar Salam my story another time to anybody of Rwandair. I don't know what more will happen. I feel that It is a bad airline company and It is the last time that I will take a flight with them. Also staff  in Kilimanjaro Airport with this airlines are having inadequate and inpolite treatment. I feel so defrauded.

### "children’s allergies were not taken seriously"
Flew Rwandair from Harare, Zimbabwe. to London, UK. via Kigali. My children’s allergies were not taken seriously. They both have anaphylactic reactions to various food. I struggled to get suitable meals for them and my children were given nothing but fruit at times yet hot meals could and should have been prepared for them. I checked in Kigali if they’d have their correct meals given to them and was reassured everything had been sorted. To my surprise nothing had and staff didn’t know if allergens were in the meals they were serving. You are only asked if you want 'beef' or 'chicken' and won’t know till you open your meal if it was spicy or not. I tried to swap my child’s meal as they’d been serving beef curry with pasta and a creamy chicken dish with rice. All I’d been told was 'beef or curry' by a very rude member of staff. I asked if both my kids’ untouched and unopened meals could be swapped with chicken but the vile member of staff argued with me saying the meal which he hadn’t tasted himself, wasn’t spicy! What could have been resolved in seconds took longer than necessary. He challenged me in an aggressive tone, which was completely unnecessary. He reluctantly agreed to swap the meals over. He’d told me there were no other meals for my children so I based my choice on guess work. Had I known in advance that my children’s dietary requirements wouldn’t be met on such a long flight, I’d have spent my money elsewhere. Other than that there were several stops and delays on our way to Zimbabwe. Seats were double booked from Kigali to Lusaka. On our return we struggled to find seats with our children and staff announced that passengers should sit wherever there was a seat. Staff made sure toilets were clean but they could have at least changed gloves as they wore the same gloves they’d been wearing while serving food. The plus side is: one of their meals was delicious, their flights are generally more affordable than most but that comes with a price. Rwandair has more luggage allowance than most in relation to Zimbabwe, staff on our way to Zimbabwe were friendly and approachable aside from speaking in their own language, they also kept passengers well hydrated considering the heat. It would be helpful for staff to carry a laminate list of ingredients as none of them seem to know what’s in the food they serve and it would be helpful to actually say to passengers “Would you like beef curry served with pasta or would you like creamy chicken and rice” rather than “beef or rice”. Some customers who don’t eat spicy food can make a choice rather than having to guess and waste food by returning or swapping it. To and from, staff didn’t know what sort of meals they were serving.

### "recommend this airline"
Entebbe to London via Kigali. I can thoroughly recommend this airline. The service is as good as (or in many cases better than) any major airline, with cabin crew who are courteous, helpful and attentive with good quality food and beverages. The aircraft are new and the cabins are spotless. The seating in business class offers lay flat beds and they offer Premium Economy cabin. I travel a lot in Africa and even if there are quicker options I prefer to take this airline. Punctuality is good and in flight service even on short flights is excellent. The let downs are the appallingly slow security check at Kigali which can take an hour which causes delays to flights at busy times. This is a problem required to be addressed. Also they could do with a wider choice of films on the entertainment system.

### "a very good experience"
Gatwick to Dar es Salaam via Kigali. We had a very good experience with Rwandair - new plane, ample seats and leg room, all drinks were free including alcohol and staff were friendly and polite. On baggage checkin, a novice member of Gatwick’s baggage handling staff, accidentally pressed the button to send one of our suitcases onto the conveyor belt without any tags or labels on it. Disaster we thought but were reassured that it would very quickly be found. After several enquiries as to its whereabouts, we found ourselves at the gate about to board, still without the missing case. We didn’t want to board the plane knowing it was here at Gatwick, but were approached and reassured by staff that he would make it his personal mission to find the case. He gave us his card and we decided that email would be the best method of contact. We arrived in Dar es Salaam where we had an email from him saying he hadn’t yet found the case - our hearts sank as we felt there was little chance of finding it. We had one night in Dar, then caught the ferry over to Zanzibar, where we spent another night in Stonetown. That morning he emailed us to say that the case had been found, sent on the first available flight to Dar to then be forwarded by air to Zanzibar airport where it would be arriving at 4pm that afternoon. We couldn’t believe it! So, thank you Rwandair, we have sung your praises since coming back home because it was the personal touch that set you aside from other reputable airlines. We would very much enjoy flying with you again and would highly recommend this airline to anyone considering it. No need to worry, they’re brilliant - go ahead and book it.

### "Spotless clean plane"
Kigali to Johannesburg via Lusaka. First experience with Rwandair and immediately a hit. Spotless clean plane, warm welcome by crew, leather seats with good comfort and perfect catering. Once Kigali Airport will be a real airport - nowadays only a very small and less inviting building - it will benefit Rwandair in its expansion.

### "poorly trained and incompetent"
Douala to Dubai via Entebbe. Our visitor arrived at Douala three hours prior to her flight. Airline staff informed her that the aircraft had technical problems, and the flight was rescheduled to the following day. They provided accommodation and she arrived at the airport the following day. Without explanation, our traveler was denied boarding and was informed that there was a problem with her ticket and that it would need to be modified or that a completely new ticket would have to be purchased. No other help was provided and the next customer was assisted. After hours of long distance calls to Rwandair and also to the travel agency headquarters in New York (and 30 hours in limbo), no assistance was received from Rwandair and the agency told us that Rwandair had updated their system to reflect that the traveler was a no show at the airport and subsequent flights were all canceled. At best, employees are poorly trained and incompetent.

### "my bags are missing again"
Kigali to Dubai. I am supposed to fly 9th February by 15:00, when I got to the airport I was told the flight left by 11, this is a mistake from Rwandair, so I was lodged in an hotel to fly the next morning by Rwandair. 10th of February I left Lagos and landed here in Dubai on 11th, upon arrival my bags are missing again, 3bags. I was told to call on 12th in order to claim my bags, I have to go again to the airport to check but only got 2 bags out of 3 bags, this is unacceptable.

### "worst experience I've had"
This was the worst experience I've had with an airline. We arrived at the airport 2 hours before our scheduled departure time. We tried as much as possible to prepare before and looked online for baggage policies and any online check-in options. When we arrived at the airport there was an employee in the RwandAir line who was checking baggage weight before we got to the check-in counter. On the RwandAir website it clearly states that baggage allowance is 30kg. We were well under that weight for both bags so we figured we were okay. To our surprise we were told that our bags needed to be under 25kg and that one bag was overweight. We were told we would need to get out of line and go remove some items from one of our bags. We complied and went back through the line which was moving extremely slow. Several people were just going straight to the front of the line which seemed to be okay with the staff. By the time the line finally started to move we were getting extremely close to the check-in close time which was one hour before departure. Even after mentioning this, the staff member moved at the same slow pace and seemed to have no clue how to process my ticket. We had no special arrangements or tickets, yet she spent a total of 18 minutes trying to figure things out. By the time she finally finished processing our boarding pass she tells us that it is 7:18 and boarding closes at 7:20! We luckily were able to cut through the security line and make it there in time. When we arrived for a layover at the Kigali airport the Rwandair staff was no better. The staff member at the Joburg airport told me that I would need to get my boarding pass in Kigali (even though I already had a mobile boarding pass). When I arrived in Kigali the staff member seemed to have no clue why I didn't have a printed boarding pass from Joburg (even after showing him my mobile boarding pass) and took about 20 minutes to issue me another. When we finally got onto the plane our flight ended up being delayed one hour due to us waiting on passengers (who never arrived) from another incoming flight which was also delayed. We waited on a HOT plane for over an hour. Our original flight and e-ticket stated that our flight was to depart from JNB with a layover in Kigali and final destination to Accra. To our surprise, when were on the plane the captain announced that we were heading to Lagos, Nigeria. I panicked thinking that we were on the wrong flight and asked the flight attendant if we were headed to Accra. He told me that we were but were going to stop in Lagos to drop some passengers off first, so we just needed to stay on the plane. Not once  was this communicated either in an email, at the ticket counter or on the airline screens. You'd think that this would be something that was mentioned. We arrived in Accra almost an hour later than our expected arrival time.

### "very happy with both flights"
I flew with Rwandair from Kigali to Entebbe (return) and was very happy with both flights. The aircraft are new and the staff is great. Despite the very shorts flights (about 35 min), the crew made you feel welcome and we were provided with snacks and drinks.

### "my luggage are yet to arrive"
Kigali to Lagos with Rwandair. I landed in Lagos on the 22nd July and till today 26th July my luggage are yet to arrive. This type of service is certainly unacceptable. The airline is not the first that I would be traveling on. Have my daughters things in there and a couple of other important items. I have never experienced this type of service with any airline. After calling them several times, all they could tell me after 4 days is that my baggage was tagged for Kigali without any remorse. How insensitive!

### "left 10 passenger bags in Dubai"
Dubai to Kigali with Rwandair. The airline left 10 passenger bags in Dubai because the airline was over their weight limit. This doesn't make sense because the plane was only 60% full. When asked when my bags would arrive in Kigali the staff said they were unsure and this was normal. I'm in Kigali for work and I had my business attire in my checked luggage. The customer service from checking in to landing was less than desirable. The plane was very dirty and had no been cleaned after the last flight. The flight attendant spoke was rude to some of the passengers. I'm quite disappointed to learn the Rwanda Air frequently leaves passenger's checked luggage at the originating airport to bring other cargo on the plane. Nor do they compensate you for lost or late luggage.

### "flight attendants full of smiles"
I flew with Rwandair for the first time in July 2015 using the route Dar es Salaam - Kigali. I didn't know what to expect initially. However, my experience was quite pleasant and the flight attendants were full of smiles and were helpful. Their seats however for business class were quite small. I don't recall inflight entertainment as the journey was only 1 hour and my novel was what I planned to entertain myself with. I also found the staff on the ground at the airport in Kigali just as helpful. I would definitely use them again on this route and would recommend the Dar es Salaam - Kigali route. I am keen to see reviews on other cities they fly in as they are quite affordable.

### "rudest flight attendant"
Travelled with Rwandair return from Kigali to Dubai. The outward flight was okay, food was good and the staff was warm but on coming back from Dubai to Kigali, I got the rudest flight attendant. the seats on the plane are very squeezed so I requested for a change of seat since I was carrying an infant, the lady just shrugged like I was disturbing her. I had to squeeze between two people on seat 5B with an infant, while more comfortable seats were vacant. Carry a book or magazine as there is no IFE. The airport staff are however very helpful.

### "I can't speak highly enough"
I was concerned about this Rwandair flight after reading some negative reviews, but I can't speak highly enough. The flight was only half full, meaning very personal service from the staff on board. The plane was quite new and very clean. The food we received was good and surprising given it was only an hour flight. My bag arrived in good time. Absolutely nothing to complain about.

### "flight was comfortable"
Once onboard the Rwandair flight was comfortable and the cabin service and meals were good. The flights each way were quite empty and passengers spread out to empty rows. IFE is by drop down screen and they had the same movie each way. Check in early as there appears to be confusion about departure times for WB100. Some days of the week it leaves earlier to stop at Lusaka on the way to JNB. We confirmed our flight as leaving at 1810 but when arriving at the airport it indicated 1845 as the departure time. We boarded the aircraft when the screens indicated that boarding would occur in 20 minutes. We left at the earlier time and flew direct but it was not a day when it was scheduled to leave earlier on account of the extra stop.

### "Rwandair not offering even a single glass of water"
I flew Rwandair from Libreville to Johannesburg via Kigala, at the end of August 2015 from LBV to JNB, and was very disappointed. The flight LBV to KGL without any problem but when I reached Kigali, to my surprise the ground staff told me to show my vaccination book. I told them that the ground staff from origin did not tell me that I needed to carry my vaccination book. The ground staff told me to stand aside. They agreed that ground staff from origin should have asked it to me as a requirement to travel. I then asked them to find me a solution and suggested that I would agree to get the yellow fever vaccine again at Kigali Airport as long as I could move on with my trip. Their response was that there was no doctor at the airport and I needed a visa to get out of the airport. I told them that I was willing to pay for visa and hotel to stay until the next flight to JNB but they categorically refused to let me out of the airport or to call for a doctor. I finally ended up waiting 22 hours at Kigali airport and Rwandair not offering even a single glass of water. They kept telling me that they would provide me with food and even a free phone to call home, but nothing happened. Fortunately I always carry my credit card and could satisfy my thirst and hunger. Finally, they flew me back to Gabon and told me that my ticket was lost. They treated me as a refugee, keeping all my documents all the way to LBV. When i reached LBV, I complained to the ground staff and to the station manager, but until now I did not get any call or mail. I have never been treated like this before.

### Rwandair customer review
Dubai - Johannesburg - Dubai 10 and 24 Jan. Was initially very apprehensive but was pleasantly surprised. Legroom excellent. Airport staff more than friendly even stamped our passports so we could enter the country during our 8 hour stopover. Will definitely use again if possible!

### Rwandair customer review
Flew Kigali-Mombasa with RwandaAir 3rd Dec 2013. Booked online which was hassle free. No online check-in though. The plane was modern 737-800 American cockpit crew local cabin staff. Leather seats with good legroom. Despite short flight (1.5hrs) they managed to serve hot meal. Professional and friendly cabin crew. Overhead screens displaying flight tracking only. The plane was half empty which partly explains the efficient service. 45mins delay on departure 30mins on arrival. Bags were waiting on belt when clearing immigration. Surprisingly good experience flying with RwandaAir.

### Rwandair customer review
WB100. When I work in Nairobi and needed to travel to Kigali for meetings I would take this airline and I have not experienced anything so bad in the past. However a few months ago when I decided to fly it back to South Africa after a meeting in Kigali I was shocked by my experience. I normally take South African Airways on that route but this time the flight was not available and therefore booked Rwandair. The airport seemed very busy - like a market place with women talking at the top of their voices to other women right next to them. When it came to boarding there was a mad scramble to get through the gate and onto the plan. It was not organized at all. When we got into the plane the captain spoke to us for a brief moment and that was it until landing time. In the air they served dinner immediately after take off with no snacks prior to dinner. They also didn't seem organized as the person serving drinks served kids first and the one who came with the dinner forgot to serve some children and their poor mother had to walk to the front to get her children food and walk all the way to the back to her children holding 2 trays of hot food while trying to balance as she walked. On landing passengers only knew it was landing time as the lights were switched off and the captain then announced we were landing and told crew to take their seats. On landing the plane seemed to bounce of the tarmac and lean to the right before it finally settled on the tarmac but the Captain kept braking suddenly on the taxi to the gate. This seemed strange to me and all the while the Captain did not explain anything to us about the landing or the breaking. I'm not sure I would want to take this airline again to Johannesburg in the near future.

### Rwandair customer review
Travelled J'burg to Kigali and Kigali to JRO in July. Both flights left and landed on time. Check in was efficient and in flight service was above my expectation. Aircraft were clean and comfortable with plenty of legroom. A very pleasant experience and highly recommended.

### Rwandair customer review
I had purchased a flight from Nairobi to Jo'burg in November of 2012 for a trip I took the first week of April. Apparently when I was trying to catch my connecting flight to Kigali I was informed that my flight had changed completely. And I'm not referring to a minor change in time but completely. I guess when RwandAir made the changed they forgot to put me on the new flights. They had informed me that I wouldn't be able to catch my connecting flight until the following day. Instead they put me on another flight with a different airline. I had to wait for 11 hours at the airport. Additionally my return flight was changed as well which included another long wait for my connecting flight. I also had to change another flight because of this. RwandAir caused me to waste time waiting money to change my flight and sleep. I don't want to punish the courteous flight attendants as they were great but I would be careful with booking with RwandAir.

### Rwandair customer review
Excellent flight late last year from Jo'burg to Kigali return. New plane top class friendly staff very professional. Will definitely use them again when required.

Two flights in January 2013 JRO - KGL (via Mombasa) in their brand-new CRJ900 NextGen (less than two months old at the time) and KGL - NBO (ageing B737-500). All flights departed on schedule and food and beverages were included ranging from hot breakfast for the one hour flight to Nairobi to a packet of cashew nuts for JRO - Mombasa. Crew courteous and professional planes appear to be in excellent shape. The final landing in NBO was a bit rough but no complaints otherwise. The only downside was that the flight times had been changed a couple of times between booking and the actual flight. Apparently this is quite normal but flight times have been pushed from mid-morning to early morning then late afternoon before back to mid- morning and finally to mid-evening where they remained. Mind you there were 7 months between booking and the flights so this might be normal however we left plenty of time in our planning to account for those changes.

WB300 KGL to DBX 14 November 2012. My boarding time was at 11.15 nothing had happened by 12.15 so I started to get a bit nervous inquired with airport representatives who was sitting at the boarding gate. They said they don't know what was happening and would check. I found that to be quite unprofessional they should have known there were complications. They came back 30 mins later to advise us that they apologize for the delay and will advise accordingly. Flight left after 3.00 that morning. I really think Rwandair team in Kigali needs to be trained accordingly. Its just good manners to keep your passengers informed on things like this.

Outbound KGL to MBA in a newish 738 was fine with a hot lunch served on this sub 2 hour flight. Adequate leg room and friendly and competent cabin staff. Arrived at MBA airport for return flight to find that the flight had re-scheduled for 12 hours later. I chose not to wait as I had commitments in Kigali and flew back at considerable expense with another airline via NBO.

Flew last week from Dubai to Mombasa return. Not sure what to expect as this was my first flight with RwandAir however I was pleasantly surprised. Nice aircraft friendly cabin crew good service and comfortable seats. Price was excellent and it was the only direct flight from Dubai to Mombasa so saved me lots of valuable time.

Kigali-Johannesburg. We were 45 mins late departing Kigali with no explanation but arrived in Jo'burg at the scheduled time. Clean aircraft very smooth flight professional and very friendly crew Rwandan 'Primus' beer served on board with a tasty meal. Like most African continental airlines expensive compared to what we are used to in Europe but otherwise very good. Recommended for convenient and safe travel throughout the region.

I recently travelled with Kenya Airways/Rwandair through one ticket that I had booked as a package through Kenya Airways. Problems happened: overbooking both ways (Kenya) making me board Rwandair without boarding pass baggage not delivered when Rwandair received it the very same night I arrived. While Kenya Airways has been co-operative in a settlement and is taking steps to help with the necessary paper work for the insurance Rwandair has been most uncooperative never responding to my messages and when I physically showed up at the office they plainly contradicted their own report in front of us. Results: Financial loss on my side and problems with the insurance.

Bujumbura-Kigali-Bujumbura Dash 8-100. Both flights on time safety and organisation appear to be high. Good service onboard despite flight duration is only 40 minutes: snacks 4 different juices sodas. Good information on board and luggage delivered in 5 minutes upon passing immigration.

These guys nearly spoilt our trip. On arrival in Jo'burg we were to board Rwanda Air to Kigali. There were no signs of any check in counters. So after an hour of rushing between terminals we finally contacted someone at Rwanda Air who had said the flight was cancelled. He was not even apologetic for not telling us beforehand. I would be very careful if booking with them.

Nairobi to Kigali return. Excellent service on both legs. The e-ticketing system is still in process so bring your ticket number as well as the booking reference with you to the airport in Nairobi. I would gladly fly this airline again.

I was due to fly from Kigali to Entebbe and had made a reservation months beforehand. I reconfirmed by e-mail about a month before the flight and two days before the flight telephoned to Rwandair in Kigali to make sure that the reservation was still valid. I was told that it was and the agent mentioned my first name which I had not given her on the telephone. When I turned up at the airport I was told that my reservation had been cancelled and no reason was given. Four or five other passengers were in the same position. We all waited to see if there were no-shows but there weren't. I would say that Rwandair which could not be booked through Opodo Travelocity or Expedia is to be avoided.

Rwandair Express Johannesburg - Kigali on an MD-80 business class. Really not a bad flight - we were about 1/2 an hour late boarding with no announcements but after that it was fine: a reasonable little meal and nice wine. We had a touch-down in Bujumbura so there was rather a lot of taking off and landing but reasonably quiet and comfortable flight. My bags were lost in a connection a Johnannesburg (as always) and so it was the usual long process of waiting for the bags not to appear waiting to fill out forms and then waiting three days but the bags eventually found me!

Nairobi – Kigali and Kigali – Entebbe. The NBO-KGL flight on a MD-82 that showed little signs of its age. Aircraft pretty clean seat pitch acceptable and no problem with understanding the public announcements which I have experienced differently on other airlines in the region. Safety demonstration okay although I wonder if the life jacket should have been shown as the flight was passing right over Victoria Lake. Flight left almost on time for the 70 minutes flight. Snack (sandwiches fruit salad muffin) served on board. Quality was okay for the length of the flight. Alcohol served free of charge. Professional and hard working crew (partly western) doing their job with a smile. Arrival and immigration procedures at KGL were efficient. KGL – EBB on a DHC8 previously operated by a Ethiopian carrier. Aircraft was clean. Only the seats were a bit older. Flight left even before scheduled departure time. Once again a professional crew serving drinks and peanuts on the fifty minutes flight. Amusing to see the cabin crew member performing the usual pre-landing announcement and checking a newspaper at the same time. Staff at the airline city office in Kigali very helpful when I had to reschedule due to serious family circumstances back home.
