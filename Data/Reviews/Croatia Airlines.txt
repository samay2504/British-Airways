### "thought we had paid for baggage"
We had a terrible experience with customer relations with Croatia Airlines over the last 9 months trying to get a refund for an overcharge at their counter at Heathrow. We had booked tickets in and out of Croatia via London. We thought we had paid for baggage both ways. When we checked in they told us we only had paid for baggage on the return trip. It was supposed to be 30-40 euros extra for a bag but at the counter they told us it would be 150 euros for the first bag and 75 for the second unless we paid on the Croatia air website, which wasn’t working. So we paid the 225 and submitted a claim when we got home. They asked for proof we took the flight, receipts and my banking information to process our refund. All of which I provided. Then after not getting paid for months I followed up. They decided they wanted me to courier the receipts to them in Croatia… so I did. Still nothing for months. Then they decided they needed a screenshot of the website not working… which I could not provide. So was ultimately denied after initially being told I would get a refund. As it should’ve been 30 euros online or 40 at the counter. They never answered why their staff charged 150 and 75 at the counter.

### "Not a single response"
First flight cancelled while sitting on the plane due to technical problem which is unfortunate and understandable. What followed however was diabolical. Staff on ground had no idea what to do. Sat around for 5 hours then transferred to hotel 1.5 hours away from airport for basically a 3 hour sleep as the next flight scheduled at 6am next day. Got to airport at 4.30 am only for the rescheduled flight to be cancelled 30 minutes before boarding. Next flight schedule 8 hours later, with no support while we sat around the airport. Arrived 40 hours late and missed our international connection. Have written 18 times now to the Croatia Airline and applied as per their website for compensation which is applicable under EU law. Not a single response.

### “no one cares enough to help”
I wish I had researched before booking with this awful airline. My wife and I flew from Milan (MXP) to Split (SPU) on September 22, and my bag never arrived. We were upset but followed the procedure, filed a PIR report with Split Lost and Found, and were told the luggage would likely arrive the next day. We naively thought, "Okay, let’s try to enjoy the trip, and tomorrow we’ll have our things. How wrong we were. Once you deal with their customer service, you realize no one cares enough to help. They just say, "It’s not in our hands; contact Lost and Found. Lost and Found, in turn, says it’s up to the airline. The lack of communication and cooperation is shocking. The situation got worse when I was told my bag wouldn’t be sent to Split until September 26—four days later. So, we were at a beach destination without proper clothing. We had to buy essentials and file a report in the hope of reimbursement, though reviews suggest that’s unlikely. Imagine spending hours of a short vacation shopping for clothes. It may not sound like a big deal, but try finding beachwear at the end of September when stores are only selling autumn clothes. And all the while, we were calling and emailing Croatia Airlines and Lost and Found every day, only to get little to no response. By September 26, the day they originally said the bag would be sent to Split, we were no longer in Split. I had already asked two days earlier for the bag to be sent to Madrid, our next destination. Yet, on September 27, to my shock, they sent it to Split despite my clear instructions that we wouldn’t be there. I continued calling and emailing anyone I could find, but no one replied with any useful information. It doesn’t matter who you contact, even the CEO—no one responds. They are utterly incompetent. I got more help from Iberia (who wasn’t responsible for the lost bag) using the PIR number than from Croatia Airlines. Finally, on September 28, my bag arrived at Madrid Barajas Airport at 12:30 AM on an Iberia flight (they’re the heroes of this story). I was told I’d be contacted for delivery once it arrived, but that call never came. I spent my last day in Madrid calling Croatia Airlines—no answer. I sent countless emails—no response. It was Saturday, so I guess they were resting without a care in the world. On September 29, the day of my return flight, I went to the airport early to try and find my bag. Still no word from Croatia Airlines -- it was Sunday, probably still resting with complete peace of mind. At the airport information desk, they let me into the arrivals area where Lost and Found is located. Since the bag was sent on an Iberia flight, I went to their desk. The staff there was surprised at my bag’s journey: Milan, Vienna, Split, Zagreb, and finally Madrid. After some patience and tracking, they finally found it. After an entire trip without my belongings, I got the bag just before checking in to fly back home. My vacation was ruined, and even if I’m reimbursed a few hundred dollars for clothes, I spent far more on flights and hotels only to waste my time dealing with Croatia Airlines' incompetence. Be warned: if you fly with Croatia Airlines and encounter an issue (lost bags, delays, etc. ), you’ll get no help. They’ll make minimal effort, if any, on your behalf.

### “an absolute rip off”
Not Verified |  Extortion. We paid around 950 Euro for a 1h hour flight. There were no other options when booking. Later discovered there is a monopoly to use only this airline from Split Airport. Others on the plane paid more. To make things worse, seat selection was useless despite paying for extra leg room. They made us move to the back of the plane to balance the weight. We were not allowed to take our carry on luggage as the plane was a small propeller old clunky dirty piece of junk. To make it worse the overhead storage cabinets were mostly empty. We were only given water. The staff were great but Croatia Airlines are an absolute rip off. We learnt the hard way. Will NEVER fly with this airline ever again.

### "no space for backpack overhead"
Poor schedule after delayed without information. Changes of gate without proper information. Exhausted air crew, no space for backpack overhead.

### "Avoid if you can!"
Not Verified |   We had a very bad experience with Croatia Airlines. They have truly terrible customer service and do not care about customers, nor do their italian counterparts in the bag retrieval department. My bag was lost on a direct flight. How does that happen, well it does on Croatia airlines, it ended up somehow in Germany and it took them 3 days to find it. Woman clerk at split airport mentioned my partner's name several times on a long call while we waited to check our bags, and when we asked what it was about she said had nothing to do with us, weird. Then bags were mistagged and his bag was tagged as mine and mine tagged as his went missing. Trying to find anything out was awful with their baggage tracking was offloaded to a company that literally hung up the phone on me repeatedly. Then they once again handed responsibility off to another company to deliver the bags, with no ability to find out what time or day it would arrive. We were traveling and had days activities planned, well forget that, we had to literally not leave our apartment in case they showed up, which driver came at 830pm, and he said he had been working for 24 hours straight delivering lost bags. I believe it! No apology, no compensation, no concern. Avoid if you can!

### "Definitely recommend"
Not Verified |  We flew from Dubrovnik to Athens and then Athens to Zagreb on Croatia Airlines. They were on time within 15 minutes for both flights. You drop your bag on the tarmac and they load it into the belly of the plane. And then you pick it up directly from the tarmac after the flight, so there is very little chance for lost luggage which I like. They allow a smaller carry-one bag as well. They did not weigh our bag or try to charge us for anything extra. We were allowed to pick our seats for no charge. The seats are standard and comparable to Southwest airlines for leg room and space. We were served water and drinks on both flights. For the price we paid, it was a great deal. Some people might be nervous about flying a propeller plane, but it was a very smooth flight in both directions with almost zero turbulence and a very smooth landing. If you had to fault them for one thing, it would be nice to have some in flight entertainment. Other than that, it was a perfect flight. Definitely recommend.

### "found that was flight was cancelled"
As long term KL platinum/gold booked to Split. 2nd leg Zagreb to Split by Croatia Airlines. Once I arrived in Zagreb I found that was flight was cancelled, which can happen. I was rebooked at flight 5 hours later and provided with lounge access to overcome 4 hours. However, they did not let me in, over unfriendly staff and they just let hang around their clients and spend money in the bars. This was a one time experience.

### "worst customer service I've ever encountered"
Not Verified |  My recent experience with Croatia Airlines was marred by the worst customer service I've ever encountered. The staff appeared disinterested, unhelpful, and lacked basic courtesy. Passengers were treated as inconveniences rather than customers. The flight was uncomfortable, but it was the shocking attitude of the airline's personnel that truly made this trip unforgettable for all the wrong reasons I strongly advise looking for alternatives to Croatia Airlines.

### "rude and short tempered staff"
Not Verified | For those of you wanting to travel with Croatia Airlines! One of the WORST airlines to deal with from personal experience. I am by all means not a difficult or needy person, and generally don't have the need for posts like this. But my limits have truly been pushed! We travelled to Croatia on July 15th, when my daughters luggage didn't arrive. We filed a report after waiting in line for God knows how long with a baby and a 2 year old. Long story short, I still didn't receive the luggage or any form of payment from Croatia Airlines as it is now their responsibility to do so. I had to scramble and buy clothes, diapers, formula and other things necessary for my 4 month old at the time. Definitely not the expense I had intension of having. The airline is very slow at getting back to me about any information at all times. The phone numbers listed on their website, are all out of service when you try to call at any time of day/night. I have filed numerous complaints and sent emails with detailed amounts of things and their cost in the luggage. Emails were sent to any form of contact I was able to receive. Still no word of location of the luggage or pay-outs of any sort. Unfortunately, we have no desire to go or suggest to anyone to go and visit this country, due to rude and short tempered staff you have to deal with no matter what the problem might be.

### "need to do more about overall organisation"
The interior of plane such as window frame, seats, seats belt, plastic back from back of the seats are in bed condition (broken, over used, not clean, with very old commercial stickers on plane seats). Cabin personnel - overall rate - referring to uniforms are very rustic. Meaning that cabin crew need to have fresh look, tided hair and clean uniforms. Informing passengers for delay of flight - 30 minutes we were waiting just for answer when we can expect our flight. On top of that no service personnel on gate 16 at all / not even from Company responsible staff to explain. Believe that this company need to do more about overall organisation and staff.

### "I was treated in a disgusting and childish way"
Not Verified |  We recently did a flight from Dubrovnik to Frankfurt and I experienced what is akin to schoolyard bullying type behavior from one of the female cabin crew. I was asked to place my carry on luggage under my feet and advised the female crew member that I would like to leave my pack in the overhead luggage due to having long legs. There was plenty of space in the compartments surround me so it shouldn’t have been an issue. The crew member was quite nasty but eventually agreed, late on in the flight I fell asleep and my knee was slightly out in the aisle but certainly not enough to prevent the drinks trolley from passing me without incident. I was woken quite suddenly by a sharp pain in my knee only to find the trolley had slammed into it. I said to the flight attendant that she could have woken me to ask me to move it only to have been given a very ride look and her muttering obscenities under her breath, which I chose to ignore. Later in the flight when she was collecting rubbish, she took all the empty cups from the passengers around me but totally ignored me and refused to take my empty cup. Other passengers obviously noticed this rudeness as they had witnessed the other events earlier. One even asked me to make a complaint but I chose not to as it wasn’t worth the trouble. Basically I was treated in a disgusting and childish way and even ended up having a large bruise on my knee. Disgraceful behavior to say the least.

### "unpleasant Croatia Airlines staff"
Flight cancelled on 23 December due to "force majeure," specifically limited visibility in Sarajevo. However, that is a lie, and there was sufficient visibility. All the other flights for Sarajevo successfully landed. We have received no option but to go with the bus for some 6-7 hours drive. We have received 0.25 bottles of water (number of bottles was insufficient to cover all passengers). We did not even depart at the time when we were supposed to be in Sarajevo already. Very unpleasant Croatia Airlines staff verbally fought with passengers and rejected to provide their ID number or any kind of accreditation. Worst experience ever.

### "the airline doesn’t have consistency"
There was a 20 minutes delay due to late arrival. Boarding was done with bus at very remote location. The aircraft a little overused. Seats were standard Euro Business that had better days. Safety presentation was done with dropdown screens; the first row left screen was not operating. Welcome was professional but not friendly. After departure service started which was consisted of a box with local produced packed products. There was a selection of drinks and sparkling wine. At the end coffee was offered which were 2 spoons of coffee and hot water – nothing special. No IFE app. At Dubrovnik had to bus transfer to the terminal had to pass through passport control, print your boarding pass and go through screening again. No connecting passengers’ service. Lounge at DBV was small and selection of food was 3 different kinds of sandwiches. Boarding to DH4 was done by bus but this time crew was much friendlier. Service was much better, asked if wanted second round of drinks and same coffee was presented perfect. Pity that the airline doesn’t have consistency.

### "The service was terrible"
The flight was fine but the staff is totally careless. During the flight they were quite rude and after, I had to contact them for some information and they took more than a week to reply and they asked about the flight info 3 times. The service was terrible!

### "not particularly friendly"
My flight was canceled without any explanation. While the communication was fast, we were only given a choice of a ridiculously long layover for the first flight and a two days delayed return flight which was not acceptable. It didn't seem like they actually tried to help us and were not particularly friendly.

### "the most horrible flight experience"
Unfortunately this was the most horrible flight experience in years : at the airport the check in started with delay later on they let us wait in a small corridor with seats for 6 people - I immediately with cod some services are reduced but what Croatia Airlines did was simply scandalous - everybody did receive 25 cl of still water - nothing else ; As soon the fasten seat belts sign was switched off, immediately the FA did close the curtain of the pantry in front of the cabin - obviously to eat and drink by themselves - sounds of opening cans with soda's were heard and there was a smell of coffee. The restroom in front op the plane normally for business class passengers remained unavailable during the entire flight - people were rudely sent way to the rear end of the plane. One of the FA very rudely threw some papers she did not need on empty side aside me. The only item this airline did was taking away the money of the business class passengers. FA were very unfriendly as well.

### "I never received a refund"
Croatia Airlines has a codeshare with Turkish Airlines so my ticket from Istanbul to Zagreb was paid to Croatia Airlines. The flight on June 19 2020 was canceled but I never received a refund. I requested the refund several times and I always got a vague answer that the refund is not possible at this time. I wanted to warn other travelers not to purchase tickets with Croatia Airlines at this time when the country is placed on UKs red list because the refund with this company seems impossible. I received refunds related to Covid 19 from British Airways, Pegasus and Turkish Airlines. It seems that only Croatia Airlines is not issuing the ticket refund.

### "cash refund would not be made"
Cancelled flight and only offered voucher or rebooking. I selected voucher, but EU requires cash refund also be offered. On contacting Croatia Airlines they insisted that because a voucher was selected then cash refund would not be made.

### "flights were on time, uneventful"
Sarajevo to Amsterdam via Zagreb. Both flights were on time, uneventful, and included a small snack bag. First leg was on a Q400 turboprop, second on an A320. Both planes looked to be in good condition. Zagreb gate staff were strict on cabin luggage size and weight so some bags had to be checked at the gate. The last flight landed on the distant Polderbaan runway in Amsterdam and was a 25 minute taxi to the gate but that's not Croatia Airlines' fault. Overall cheaper than Lufthansa.

### "very bad in every respect"
Rome to Sarajevo via Zagreb. The shame of airlines, boorish staff, rude, rude, endless delays, service on board non-existent, tiny turboprop aircraft where you can't even bring your trolley bag on board. Croatia Airlines, very bad in every respect. I was also denied a glass of carbonated water because you could only give in business. Never again with them, first and last time. La vergogna delle compagnie aeree, personale cafone, maleducato, sgarbato, ritardi infiniti, servizio a bordo inesistente, aerei minuscoli a turbo elica dove non puoi neanche portare il trolley a bordo. Croatia Airlines, pessima sotto ogni punto di vista. Mi è stato negato anche un bicchiere di acqua gassata perché solo in business si poteva dare. Oltre la vergogna, Mai più con loro, prima e ultima volta.

### "no-frills airline delivers as planned"
Zagreb to Dubrovnik. A320 aircraft which is  comfy, friendly service, experience at the airport was smooth, website is very easy to use and allows for online check-in and seat selection easily with mobile (iPhone Wallet) Boarding Pass, etc.. Pre-flight email notifications for check-in and flight info were very useful. Service on-board friendly and flight was on-time. I had a technical question on my booking after the flight and was able to find the customer service email address directly on Croatian Airlines website and email them. A customer rep replied in perfect English within a couple of hours with all the details. Overall no-frills airline but delivers as planned, with up-to-date digital platform and the experience was very smooth for a very competitive price.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Split to Munich. Avoid at all costs. My boyfriend and I had ONE checked luggage under his name ( you are allowed one free checked bag per person). We each had a carry on as well that we had no issues with when we travelled to our destination. However, on our way home, my boyfriend was hauled aside and forced to check in his carry on for a whopping $400!! Because they claimed it was “too big”  was a normal size) now, they could have checked it in under my name free of charge since I had no checked bag under my name (I’m entitled to one free one) but they refused, and instead scammed my boyfriend for $400. The only reason he paid was because we were close to missing our flight. The representative at the Munich airport (this happened in split) was appalled at what had happened to us and assured us that we were treated wrongly and to issue a complaint against Croatia airlines. They still refuse to refund his money and claim they can’t do anything since he already paid.

### "Very friendly service"
Rome to Zagreb via Split. Very friendly service, aircraft and seats clean and comfortable. Usually using this airline, business meals for such short flights (45 mins both sectors FCO SPU and SPU ZAG). Friendly atmosphere, quick boarding and flights on time. Generous baggage policy.

### "on time and quite comfortable"
It was my first time with Croatia Airlines and I was completely satisfied. For a little company everything was proper on time and quite comfortable. I do not expect miracles on a short budget line, but there are unpleasant surprises - this time they were gone.

### "very satisfied with the flights"
This was my first time that I used Croatia Airlines to fly from Brussels to Zagreb (round trip). I was very satisfied with the flights. The crew were perfect and the planes where clean and the service good. I love to fly with DASH 8 Q400. I recommend Croatia Airliens.

### "please do not use them"
Paris to Zagreb. I had a very bad experience with Croatia Airlines. My luggage was lost, alongside several other passengers on the same flight. Croatia Airlines just did not care. Over the next 5 days, I repeatedly contacted customer service and registered a claim, no response. With very few belongings, I repurchased basic necessities. After 5 days, I finally went to the airport and contacted baggage claim. After a 9hr wait, my luggage was flown to Zagreb and I was able to leave Zagreb, it ruined my entire trip. Several months later, after submitting a claim that only included a fraction of what I purchased for hygiene, Croatia Airlines again ignored all of my follow-up emails. The service was terrible, the cost was high and thus, I will never fly Croatia Airlines again. There are much better airlines, for your own sake, please do not use them.

### "usual delays are present"
Frankfurt to Dubrovnik. My second time flying with Croatia Airlines. As usual delays are present, but would not mind that. On the reservation we was informed that we will fly A320 instead we flew with DHC 8. Crew were polite and nice, we got some nice snacks and drinks. Overall, could be better but they try hard.

### "compensation is due"
Gatwick to Split. The flight was more than four hours delayed - with no explanation delivered at any point - and the compensation claim process has so far yielded nothing but a case number and automated responses. Croatia Airlines’ automated customer care number simply hangs up at some point - no matter how you click your way trough it (if anyone has a magic number up their sleeve, I’d be glad to have it!). Even though compensation is due under EU law, the airline has made absolutely no effort to comply. I’m averaging three e-mails per week - all left unanswered. In short: a one hour delay with no information was followed by another hour delay at the gate (with no explanation) and another two hours in the plane - again, with no explanation. The most substantial snippet of information we got from the pilot: “We might be here for three minutes - we might be here for another 90 minutes “. Even though the staff were friendly, at no point were we offered drinks or food. We had to make our way to the back of the plane as ask for something which was still limited to a glass of water. They noticed I was pregnant, because I was shifted from the exit seat, but that didn’t really prompt the possibility of receiving anything else but that precious glass of H2O. I am not blaming the staff, I am blaming the airline. Just be wary when booking and aware that there is virtually no real customer service to be expected.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Frankfurt to Dubrovnik. Nothing exceptional, just a typical European carrier with not much on board their airplane. The Pros: Friendly staff, Clean airplane, Snack and drinks. The Cons: Really tight fit even with slim seats (I am 5’10 and there was less than 2’’ spare space), No real Business (just empty middle seat), no entertainment, no Internet. Could not get emergency row seat assigned. Since nobody else did, Row was empty. Asked staff if I could move there and they agreed.

### "avoid flying with them"
Zagreb to Lisbon operated by SmartLinx Airlines. No information about the change of the operating airline, not even when boarding the aircraft at the gate. Flight itself nothing special, only with less legroom due to the high-density configuration of SmartLinx A320. From Lisbon to Zagreb operated by Croatia Airlines A319 immediately after our boarding has been completed the captain informed us that there is a small technical error and we will have to wait to fix it. And then it started: It turned into extremely long wait inside the aircraft before departure. In such a long delay (4 hours) the company is obliged to provide more than just a glass of water. We should be transferred back to the terminal and offered vouchers for food. Instead of that, after more than 3-hour seating in the aircraft the snack was distributed and then an hour after that we finally departed, however now without any snack during the flight since it was already distributed before take-off. So, it turned out that we spent more than seven hour in the Croatia Airlines airplane just with a tiny snack. Such things can happen; however, that should be properly handled. Croatia Airlines did it unprofessionally, totally unacceptable and also against EU regulations. On a positive side: both cabin crews were really nice, however unable to do anything since the general attitude of the company when dealing with an unexpected situation is way below professional standards in the industry. Will definitely avoid flying with them.

### "so far from serious company"
Munich to Sarajevo via Zagreb. Upon my arrived to the Sarajevo Airport I noticed my luggage was damaged. After reporting this to the luggage claim desk and signing the official claim (after their inspection), I wrote to the Croatia Airlines and sent all required documentation. Their answer was they need the invoice from the moment I bought my bag. No kidding, there were serious. They are circus, so far from serious company.

### "Cabin staff unprofessional"
Lisbon to Zagreb. Cabin staff unprofessional and ignoring simple passenger requests. I filled a form to become member of Frequent flyer program and got no feedback until present. Very poor meals onboard. The flight was late, behind schedule. My luggage was broken and Croatia Airlines ignored my claim. They do not treat baggage claims seriously nor respectfully.

### "Staff smart and friendly"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Split. Check in was one of the fastest we have encountered, desk opened early. Our flight to Split was comfortable. Enough leg room. Plane clean, one of the cleanest we have been on in economy. 18 year old A320. Staff smart and friendly. Small enjoyable snack given plus drinks, all included in price. Plus benefit of reduction for being a senior/pensioner, though downside you cannot book emergency exit seats for extra leg room. However flight only couple of hours long so not necessary. Return flight, again check in process prompt. Staff friendly enough but once snack served they stayed chatting at back of plane. This was our first time flying with Croatian but it will not be the last.

### "car is better and faster"
Zagreb to Prague. Terrible airline. Massive delays (3 hours and more) on all flights. No feedback on info line, no compensation at the airport. There are much better possibilities instead of this airline, even car is better and faster than this joke called Croatia Airlines.

### "cannot rate flight very positively"
Zagreb to Frankfurt. Despite the fact that Croatia Airlines extended a special courtesy to me as an airline memorabilia collector, for which I am quite grateful, I cannot rate the flight itself very positively. Business class check-in was polite and quick, and the flight attendants onboard were courteous and efficient, but who would guess that they charge business class passengers for alcoholic beverages? Certainly the onboard menu magazine indicated that miniatures ( in my case Havana Club rum ) cost $5, but I never imagined that these prices also applied to business class. This is certainly the first time that I have ever been charged for a drink when flying in a premium cabin. I will know better next time. The cold breakfast served was satisfactory. Lamentably, the front lavatory lacked soap and towels, and the sink and toilet were badly stained and unpleasant. The seating was typical European business class with economy class seats with the middle seat open. The flight arrived in Frankfurt on-time, and I wish I could rate the overall experience more positively.

### "better experience than budget"
London Heathrow to Zagreb. I fly often between UK and Croatia where I keep my boat. Croatia Airlines tries hard to be a "proper" airline not a budget flyer and generally succeeds. The staff are polite, pleasant, friendly and work hard to provide good service. The plane is always clean and the inflight magazine is informative and well written in Croatian and English. It's a better experience than budget and often not much more expensive. It would be helpful if they could fly direct to Zadar and have more winter flights. In my experience they are reliable and on time. The website has improved recently and online check in works well. These are short flights and the catering reflects that. A pleasant Croatia snack delivered with a smile and wine if you want it.

### "will fly with them again"
Paris CDG to Zagreb and Zagreb to Sarajevo round trip. Paris trip was good, eu-standard, no excitements, no disappointments. Professional staff, o.k. food/beverages, clean aircraft. Just what you need for a short flight: to be on time, to have enough space for a nap, decent cup of coffee and good apple juice. Sarajevo flight is super short, so only things I care about are that flight is on time, that seat is comfortable and that I get my coffee (on the early morning flight). Cabin crew is professional. All told, Croatia Airlines has a plus in my book, will fly with them again and I recommend it to others.

### "planes are always clean"
Nice little European airline. Planes are always clean, staff friendly, food as expected on short haul, inter-EU flights. Seats are slim, leather and comfortable, same through the airplane, with middle seat empty in business class (as is the standard in the region). Great and efficient customer service over the phone or by email. They have their own little FlyOnLine club, where if you purchase five tickets online through them - you get the sixth for free (of the same class/type as the other five) which is great if you travel a lot. Overall, among the better local services within the EU.

### "basic standard service with no frills"
Croatia Airlines is a small regional European airline based in Zagreb. I flew from Zagreb to Zurich to connect with my Swiss Airlines flight back to Singapore. The aircraft was a turboprop Dash-8. For the 1 hour flight to Zurich, flight attendants came around to serve crackers and beverages. Overall, the flight was more or less similar to other European airlines flying intra-European routes - basic standard service with no frills.

### "crew cheerful and friendly"
Copenhagen to Pula via Zagreb. Croatia Airlines is a nice airline that I've flown many times when visiting relatives in Croatia. The crew is cheerful and friendly, and even if it was some time ago they served a cold meal the snacks they serve are ok for the short flights they offer. The age is however starting to show on the aircraft but still OK. I still recommend Croatia Airlines, mainly for the crew. The cake and sparkling wine available for purchase for someones birthday and special occasions is great.

### "generous with the free drinks"
Flew London Heathrow to Zagreb with Croatia Airlines. The flight was delayed due to late arrival of the plane at Heathrow. However, their boarding process was quite efficient. The ground staff were well organized. The plane seemed to be showing its age but still clean enough. It was a 2 hour flight so no meal, they had only snacks but the olives and cheese were pretty good. They were also generous with the free drinks. Zagreb is small airport so we had to use bus to reach the arrival gates. It was good value for the money.

### "comfortable seats"
Croatia Airlines is a good middle-sized airline. I was flying from Heathrow to Zadar via Zagreb, slight delay because of heavy rain. The gate was directly across main departure hall, which is an excellent position. Flight was smooth, staff were friendly and polite. Catering was so so, but nothing worse or better than any other airlines. I had a transfer in Zagreb but the time between the two flights was more than 5 hours so I decided to take my baggage and to check-in for second flight. Check in lady was rude, but that's up to the airport, not the airline. Second flight was delayed, but we were notified on time so I had checked in later anyway. Flight was short (40 min), only drink service with cookies. Overall experience: Good airline with new aircraft with comfortable seats and excellent staff.

### "catering less than poor"
Zagreb to Sarajevo with Croatia Airlines. A short flight, catering on board was less than poor with just water and crackers. If you want juices you have to purchase them. The ticket for 50 min flight was extremely expensive, 130€ one way

### "very pleasant flight"
Rome to Split return with Croatia Airlines. Both flights in October 2015. Flight out of Rome was delayed for about 45-mins. As I don't speak Italian I had no idea why. On both flights the cabin crew worked hard to serve pretzels and juice. Really not needed for a 55-min flight! On the return we must have been ahead of time because we seemed to fly across Italy diagonally - beautiful views. Then we appeared to take a fairly low level tour up the west coast with houses and beaches right below us, before turning into Rome. A very pleasant flight.

### "not impressed"
My flight was cancelled so I tried to book a replacement flight with Croatian airlines. When I asked if there were any flights to Brussels leaving the same day I was told there were, and when I asked if I could book a ticket I was told the flight had left. When I asked if there was another I was told there was but it was full. When I asked if there was any flight I could take the same day I was told there was one via Germany, but I would have to pay €750 (with taxes) for a business class ticket. I had to be at work the next day so I took it. The ticket was economy class. Not impressed.

### "check in was rude, unhelpful"
The Croatia Airlines staff during check in was rude, unhelpful, and refused, without explanation to print out the boarding passes for each part of the flight. Forcing us to run around  trying to get boarding passes before boarding actually starts. Overall, experience with staff at the check in left me under impression that I'm unavoidable annoyance to the lady who was checking me in. Very unpleasant experience. Flight itself was average, typical boring flight.

### "not happy"
Not happy. Have just paid 75 € for excess baggage. I believe the costs are too high in comparison to BA and many other credible airline companies. Croatia Airlines failed to offer a possibility of paying excess baggage online and reduce the costs, did not offer a possibility of upgrading into a higher flying class to avoid the charges. Additionally, they do not offer online check in and they could only issue me two boarding passes while I have to get the last one in Vienna to London, even though they're aware that there is a very limited amount of time between the two fights. I'll do my best to avoid Croatia Airlines in future.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
30 min delay. Polite and attentive staff. It seems that generally flights of this airline that are scheduled for the afternoon, tend to be a bit delayed. Basic meal offered during this short flight, with an option to top it up with purchased food and drinks. Flight about 70% full. Generally smooth service and no particular problems.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Still waiting to board a flight that was supposed to leave an hour ago. All we have been told by the attendants is "we are still waiting for more information, we can't tell you anything". We will now miss the last ferry to Hvar and have nowhere to stay when we get to Split.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Booked over with Austrian, this morning flight was operated by Croatia Airlines. After take off, the flight attendant was walking with bottle of water and few plastic cups offering water. That was the only service available. No coffee, and when requested by one passenger the reply was that it was only for Business class passengers. After handing out water the flight attendant was nowhere to be seen until start of descent. Considering that the ticket for this return flight was more than 400 €, this service was terrible. They are not a low cost airline. In comparison, return flight operated by Austrian served coffee, bag of cookies as well as a small bottle of water.

Booking was easy, free seat selection and 23kg luggage included. Needed to register sports equipment and it was done by phone. Mobile check-in done using Miles&More app as Croatia Airlines uses Lufthansa check-in BCN. Croatia Airlines flies from non-Schengen gates E so nothing to do there as only one cafeteria, a small Duty-Free stand with very limited choices. Boarding on time, FAs welcoming us on board. Seat pitch is around 32 inches. Inflight magazine has lots of photos and articles to help pass time onboard. Small complimentary snack and drinks service and then later offered items from BOB program. Prices for BOB were triple than in the supermarket. We landed on time, customs cleared in 2', luggage delivered in 7'.

Clean cabins. On time departures. Flew VIE-ZAG and ZAG-DBV. Food service is something that maybe improved. (On international sector a Pack of crisps + water / on domestic sector a glass of water served). Cabin staff are pleasant. Overall a pleasant experience and recommended.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
I had the flight Paris-Zagreb-Paris in December. I have mixed emotions about Croatia airlines. Positive sides: both flights arrived on time nice clean aircraft's and very friendly cabin crew. Negative: the boarding was disorganized food service is unacceptable consisting of olives cheese/crackers for one way and disgusting sandwich for back flight and the check-in staff in Paris was not friendly at all. In terms of the food I think that the air company should go to the low cost model allowing passengers to buy the normal high quality food and drinks on board. I do not understand serving food which is inedible. This ruins the image of the company.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
October 19 to Zagreb from Amsterdam economy class and return October 24 Zagreb to Amsterdam. This was first time on Croatian. Planes are new comfortable enough for economy class and they run on time. Both flights were packed. Flight staff are remarkably friendly and attentive. They appear happy with their job and communicate that to the passengers. Served snacks and sandwiches and drinks efficiently for the 1.5 hour flight. Croatian Airline office in Zagreb was anxious to help and very friendly. The flights were loaded efficiently and the bags delivered promptly.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
My Business Class flight from RJK to LHR was business in name and cost only. Despite the online reservation system clearly indicating that the central seat on the A319 is left vacant consistent with my experience of other Star Alliance partners an upgraded passenger was put in the seat next to me and the response from the airline was only that they do not guarantee the extra space. This is an extremely misleading reservation system and doesn't help when your partner has booked the aisle seat thinking they are next to you. The only communication from the cabin crew regarding the move was to ask me whether I would mind moving to let him have the window seat! The airport had no business facilities there was no sparkling wine the food was extremely poor I was not even able to get a second piece of butter for my bread and my baggage with its priority tag was one of the last to arrive at LHR after a 45 minute wait. Considering the large price gap I am left wondering what exactly that money paid for as I am certain that a slice of ham and bowl of cereal cannot cost over 100 GBP themselves?

### Croatia Airlines customer review
I had an awful experience on this airline and Lufthansa codeshare flight from FRA to DBV. Firstly the flight was delayed 1 hour in FRA. However what happened next was a true nightmare. As we descended into Dubrovnik the captain informed us due to a problem at the airport we were to divert to Split. After landing at Split and spending 1 hour on the ground we took off for what we thought was Dubrovnik. However after attempting to land the captain turned the flight around and proceeded to Zagreb (only one announcement and no information as to why). We landed at Zagreb at which point the captain and crew left the plane and the passengers with no information. We were given no food and only one glass of water during this entire ordeal. A new crew came on board about 30 min later and several passengers demanded to leave the flight. We finally took off for DBV and landed 7 hours behind schedule. I fully understand that weather issues/operational issues arise but to not give information to passengers and create a sense of panic with the passengers is completely unacceptable.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
LGW-SPU onboard older Aircraft A319 with Recaro seating. Inflight catering (sandwich) and beverages provided but no inflight entertainment. Good luggage allowance of 23kg. Overall - okay flight with courteous Croatian Flight Crew but small plane with limited legroom. Would fly them again at this reasonable price.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Old aircraft missing armrests and smelly carpets. I fly very regularly between Greece and Croatia and unfortunately this airline is often the only option without routing half way around Europe. The staff are rude and the food terrible. Once I asked why my baggage was not being marked with priority sticker being a star alliance gold member with several airlines and was surprised when the check-in staff didn't know what Star alliance was. 500EUR round ticket Athens/Dubrovnik sometimes costing a lot more if booked less than 2 weeks to travel date. Truly disappointing that this airlines is a star alliance member.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Flew Rome to Dubrovnik off peak (which involved 2 stops) last year and I thought they provided great service. We had 3 flights (Rome-Zagreb-Split-Dubrovnik) and they were all on time which made everything perfect. They provided good assistance when we had to go through Customs in Zagreb giving us priority as we needed to take off soon (crew even fought a bit with airport staff to get our passports reviewed faster). Also were very attentive with us as airport staff barely spoke English. Planes were modern and very clean. They provided some snacks but all flights were really short. Will fly them again if I have the chance!

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Frankfurt-Split-Frankfurt. Old (ashtrays) but very comfortable A320 with the best legroom I've had and soft seats. Only one third full adding to the comfort. Nice sandwich and whisked to Split in only 1 hr and 20 mins. Return flight same quality despite full flight. Quick boarding and departing thanks to small Split Airport. Crew not very friendly. All in all: good value for money (150 euro rtn) would definitely fly again.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
My flight from Barcelona to Zagreb got cancelled. But within 2 hours we were in a 5 star hotel all expenses paid and they really tried to make it all as painless as can be. For a 3 star airline - 5 star service!

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Booked cheap flight Gatwick-Split. Outward journey good. Seats comfortable with sufficient legroom. Flight time under 2hours. Food - the worst we have been served. Cabin service - fine. Return journey - half an hour late. The worst seating. Really uncomfortable and very little padding overall. Food as outward journey-awful. They would be better not to serve food just drink. Happy we only paid an economy fare.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
We travelled on 4th September 2013 from LHR to RJK returning on 11th September. Both flights airbus 319 recaro seats comfortable enough for a 2hr flight. Aircraft clean stewardesses friendly light snack and drinks given flights. On time pleasant experience.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
3 flights London Gatwick - Split and then Dubrovnik - Zagreb - London Heathrow. Both LGW-SPU and DBV-ZAG flights were onboard the same A320 with comfortable blue fabric seats. The ZAG-LHR sector was onboard a A319 with the thin Recaro seats with less padding but adequate legroom. On both flights to and from London a substantial salad sandwich was served (including a vegetarian version for me) followed by a very generous "old school" drinks service offering a soft drink wine and tea or coffee. On the domestic sector only a glass of water was served. All flights were more or less on time the connection in Zagreb was efficient but the airport felt very overcrowded. Every Croatia Airlines employee I came in contact with was pleasant and courteous and the value was excellent much cheaper than any "low cost" alternative. The in-flight entertainment simply consisted of a promotional video of Croatia on a loop. All in all a very efficient old-style airline with a good solid service offering. Nothing very fancy but a pleasant way to travel.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Flight from Zagreb to Paris on 18 Feb 2013 and return on 22 Feb. Flying to Paris with an A319 very clean aircraft in very good condition friendly personnel smooth flight. Flying back to Zagreb with an A320 somewhat older aircraft but in good condition clean. Again friendly personnel very smooth flight. Food was simple in both directions but acceptable for a 1 hour 40 min flight good choice of drinks. Seats somewhat harder but enough space for legs in both aircraft (I'm 193 cm). No entertainment except for a tourist booklet but I don't think it's needed on such a short flight. The view of the Swiss Alps was spectacular. The price was more than affordable with 190 EUR for the return ticket (I booked early).

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Flew Zagreb - Frankfurt return. Check in was fast and smooth. Outbound flight on A320 very clean aircraft. Staff were great very friendly and attentive to all passengers. There was no inflight entertainment at all just a few screens with commercials. Generally good service for 1.5 hour flight.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Heathrow to Zagreb 8th November and returned 12th November. I travelled with a sporting rifle and as a result expected to have problems. The booking in going out and returning was smooth and well conducted. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The flight was smooth and reasonably comfortable for an economy seat. The meal quality has gone down from previous trips but when I consider the price and duration of the flight I think it is very good value. I have difficulty walking so always ask for a seat near the front door and in every case I have been obliged.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
LHR-ZAG-LHR. Tried checking in online and twice it crashed. At Heathrow I asked the check in agent for an empty row in Economy as I had seen there were several. He sort of grunted and sure enough I was sat in a row with another people so moved to an empty row once the doors closed. Not sure what the dish was it was a cold Croatian pastry filled with cheese not really to my taste. Immigration in Zagreb was disorganised with passengers queuing but those with transfer flights moving to the front so it felt like constantly moving backwards. Bags took a long time to come out despite the fact only a few passengers had checked in. Return journey was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to Business Class. Lounge was compact and the food available were peanuts cake and canapé sized bread that was it. The catfish with cold bean salad was again not to my taste. In London immigration was quick but we did have to wait 30 minutes plus for our bags. It will be interesting to see if Croatian improve the offering on this route with a rival airline launching LHR-ZAG flights from December.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
LGW-ZAG/PUY-ZAG-LHR. Used Croatia Airlines before and staff attitude and friendliness has changed a lot. On all flights smiley and polite crew. Catering has got worse now a piece of cheese strudel given (although very tasty) with 4 small pieces of honey cake on the side. On 2hr flight drinks offered only once but refilled if asked. On A319 new Recaro seats which are not very comfortable but ok for short flight. On return from ZAG 1 hour delay which was explained and apologised for. The only minus really was baggage handling at LHR waited for over 45 minutes for bags. Good airline offering good product.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
MUC-ZAG in C class. Flight departed and arrived on time. The food for business class was more than disappointing even at that early hour (9am). A very tiny bowl with slices of fresh fruits (mostly melon which is the cheapest) and a small warm croissant. That was it. No butter no jam no cold meats. As for the drinks no champagne or sparkling wine and no refills either. Really not worth the money as the seat pitch is exactly the same as in economy as Croatia does not even leave the adjacent seat vacant on their Dash 8 compared to their competitors.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
We travelled to and from Split on 7 14 September. We really enjoyed both flights: very good light meals were served on both occasions with good wine free of charge. The staff were very efficient and pleasant.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Flew business class Dubrovnik - Zagreb - Istanbul. Both planes small props. (DH4). Meal service almost non existent and very disorderly. But the most annoying part was the A/C. The plane was close to 30C and couldn't cool off until Istanbul which took 2h 20 mins. Seats are very small and leg distance very tight. All together a very bad experience for a lot of money.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
ZAG-DBV. Lost their afternoon flight but was rebooked on the evening flight at no extra cost and easily. For a flight of 45 minutes they managed to serve a bottle of water and a cookie with a smile which was highly appreciated. Their A320 was clean with enough space and comfortable seats. The flight had some turbulence but this was dealt with high professionalism from cabin crew. Departed and arrived on schedule. Very impressed with their service.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
LGW-ZAG-SKP on older A319. First sector delayed about 20 minutes but made up time in the air. Ordered a Gluten intolerant meal on the Croatia Airlines website no gluten intolerant meal available on flight. Second sector delayed about 30 minutes no gluten intolerant meal available again. Landed at SKP late and sat on taxiway for 20 minutes with no explanation given.

Amsterdam - Zagreb and back. Well maintained and clean A319 airplane. Takeoff was on time the snacks they offered was more than enough for such a short flight and was very tasty. Their new seats were comfortable the crew happy and smiling. Both flights were on time the price of the ticket was not the cheapest option but still good enough for the quality you get.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Venice to Dubrovnik. Impossible to get online boarding passes as the drop down menu on the site did not display Venice as a departure point. The day of the flight we arrived 2.5 hours early but could not locate the ticket counter. When we finally found the counter we were third in line with 2 hours before the flight. At the counter we were told that although our names were in the computer no tickets had been issued for us. Four different clerks came to straighten out the problem but after 15 minutes we were moved aside to another window. Fortunately the call did come through from Rome and we were given our boarding passes 40 minutes before the flight by Austrian Air only to find out that the flight was delayed over 2 hours. When we finally boarded staff were unconcerned and handed us a small sandwich. On our final descent into Dubrovnik we were then told that because of high winds our plane was going to be diverted to Split. When we reached Split I tried to explain our situation to a representative and was told to go ahead and complain to the airline but that they would probably do nothing about it. Needless to say a bus arrived 15 minutes later to take the passengers back to Dubrovnik- a 4.5 hour ride. We arrived at our final destination 8 hours late.

Flew Gatwick Zagreb on a modern new to fleet aircraft 2nd April very good flight good leg room meal was tasty with free wine coffee or soft drinks very welcome. On the return leg Zagreb to Heathrow two weeks later flew in an older plane with extremely good leg room courteous staff and once again a tasty meal with free drinks - no inflight entertainment but a travelog of Croatia was playing on the overhead screens.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
Over the last 30 days ZAG-AMS-ZAG ZAG-DBV-ZAG and ZAG-IST-ZAG. All flights on airbus 319 with new Reacro seats. Cabin was new and well maintained catering okay flight attendants polite. However each flight was delayed and no explanation was given. The worse was Zagreb to Istanbul return. Each flight was delayed more than two hours and crew as well as customer service acted like it was perfectly normal.

FRA-DBV-FRA. Outbound flight was two hours late no explanation given whatsoever neither on ground nor onboard. FAs on both flights seemed to be disinterested in servicing customers. On inbound flight I asked three times for a second cup of water three times I was assured that they will serve it. It never emerged.

Seat 4F (window) from ZAG to SPU on A319. Boarding was 30 mins late however only 10 mins late arriving. Online check-in helped smooth the airport experience. Inflight experience was adequate the crew young and polite and the catering adequate for such a short flight. Seats are horribly worn-out even though the plane itself doesn't look or feel old.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
FRA-ZAG on well kept A320 with charming and friendly female purser other FA's also good. Leg room and seat comfort are excellent. Safety and flight deck announcements in Croatian English and German. Soft drinks beer and wine for free apple pastry served as snack on 1hr flight. Boarding and arrival on time even though flight was the last of the day.

Frankfurt-Dubrovnik return. Airbus 319/320 very new with plenty of room and easy secure seat belts - on recent flights I've had to call for an extension so I know now it's the old planes not me. Drop-down screen for pre-flight and safety explanations. Snack served mid-flight with choice of soft drinks wine or beer and tea/coffee. Return flight diverted to Terminal B which meant a run of 35 mins to my connecting Lufthansa flight from Terminal A to Brussels.

LHR-ZAG-DBV return. Ready to leave the stand at LHR on time then over an hour late taking off due to ATC. Tight transfer in ZAG not a problem as same plane used for ZAG-DBV leg. Aircraft and crew fine meal and beer on international legs drink on 40 minute internal flight. Heavy fog in ZAG on return caused small delay.

BCN-ZAG-SJJ on A319/Q400. Check-in at BCN poor you in fact use Lufthansa's desks (which is inefficient auto machines followed by bag drop but no reference anywhere to use it). After problems at BCN we left late good cold dinner served onboard with nice Croatian wine. Worn out A319 curtains closed for Business Class despite it being empty. Arrived only 10 mins late short transit at ZAG where everything was closed despite all the flights arriving/departing at that time. Prop flight to Sarajevo comfortable and quick - just 35mins on brand new Q400 snack and drink served onboard. Efficient and friendly staff throughout. One of the best flights I've had with this airline over the years they seem a bit hit and miss irrespective of domestic or international flights.

ZAG-AMS A319. Online check-in worked well drop off baggage without waiting. Aircraft well kept all female FA's young and well presented smiling and chatty. Simple breakfast with free beverages few words from flight deck. Arrived 10mins ahead of schedule. Good value for money.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
My flight from Zagreb to Dubrovnik was abysmal. I checked in my luggage and had a microscope needed for study at my destination as hand luggage because it was delicate. Every airline in the world has been fine about this as the microscope fits into hand luggage space at the right measurements. The manager on duty that day was behaving in a very negative way and would not let me board the flight unless I put the microscope under the plane in luggage. She said I had to pay for a whole new seat to bring it with me costing 150 euros. I was not able to do that and she would not discuss the issue and insisted it went under the plane She ensured by word of mouth that it would come to no harm or damage. When I took the microscope out of the luggage at my destination it had been badly damaged. I was dismayed. I would like to say that this airlines staff were rude non customer friendly and not helpful at all. In fact worse than that she actually caused my baggage damage with a lie about its safety.

London Heathrow to Pristina via Zagreb return. Online check-in was difficult from London. It allowed me to choose my seat then the on-line process failed. On my return on-line check was not available then again it was not available for BA and Swiss who I have used on this route. For a European short haul airline the onboard service was excellent. FA's were friendly and the food good. The longer sector from LHR-ZAG return included a proper cold meal. A full and free bar service. Even on short sector ZAG-PRN included a sandwich and bar. This is welcome given the poor availability of food to purchase at PRN and ZAG. Also the tight transfer time at ZAG restricts any opportunity to purchase food/beverage. The only problem I have with Croatia Airlines is the transfer at Zagreb as the airport is a joke and the tight transfer can be stressful due to slow security processing.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
I live in DBV where Croatia Airlines has almost 100% monopoly and I am forced to use their services. The airplanes are worn out IFE practically does not exists FAs go from uninterested to rude. Delays are more a rule than an exception. If you need any assistance there you are on your own.

I guess my comments about this flight in Business Class from Frankfurt to Dubrovnik is summed up in the words of my travelling companion " Why did you book us in Economy Class? Grumpy unfriendly crew food inedible. At least we arrived safe and on time. It was a Lufthansa code-share flight so that's how we got to be travelling Croatia. What a shame because the country and people are wonderful. Not so their airline.

LHR-ZAG-LGW in Y. Flew on A319 both ways flights on time and flight attendants very nice helpful and smiling. Captain giving information about the route and weather at destination. Snacks and drinks served and this is a very short flight. Luggage is unloaded very quickly too. Considering very cheap fares flying Croatian Airlines was a nice experience and a value for money.

ATH-ZAG-SPU return. First section an A319 in good condition clean with pre assigned seats. The domestic section with Q400 I do not like that plane. I think it is uncomfortable for the passengers with tiny toilet. The service is excellent special meal (tasteful) with beverage or wine/bear. Newspapers (no English). Stewards were very friendly and eager to serve you. On time boarding on the planes but delays on departures (sometimes due to controllers sometimes due to transferring passengers).

### Croatia Airlines customer review
FRA to DBV. A320 looked like it had seen better days. Inflight service was full service though I wished they had saved on food wastage. A very cardboard chicken salad and a dry swiss roll - it was like flying was in the 70's. A British Airways tea and biscuit would have been much more welcome. Captain informative but cabin crew slightly aloof.

### Croatia Airlines customer review
London to Heathrow to Dubrovnik return. In both directions there were severe delays because of snow in Germany. There was no snow in London or Dubrovnik. The journey took 12 hours in each direction. Croatia Airlines staff were unsympathetic offered no apology and looked amazed when I asked if there would be any refreshments provided because of the delay. We paid £300 each and expected better than Ryanair service. What is the point of paying a premium when you get treated so badly?
