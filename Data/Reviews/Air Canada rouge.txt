### "No free refreshments are provided"
Not Verified |  Do not us Air Canada Rouge for long distant travel. Problems started at check in, when clerks informed our group that all bags had to be retrieved at Toronto, before continuing on our flight to Heathrow - wrong. On the aircraft the seating is so cramped , the six foot passenger sitting next to me had to sit sideways with his backside actually on my seat. The seat backs are so high it is impossible to see forward, plus the flight attendant spoke fast and garbled the information. No free refreshments are provided, unless you are happy to have a glass of water. And Air Canada Rouge do not provide inflight entertainment. This aircraft may be suitable for short haul flights, but common sense should prevail and the comfort of passengers should be made a priority.

### "showing if the bathroom is occupied"
Not Verified |  Flight was awesome. Staff was awesome. My issue is the fact that Air Canada doesn't notify people that there is a light showing if the bathroom is occupied or not. Green if available, red if occupied. The stewardess had to keep returning people to their seats as they kept lining up and blocking the aisle. A simple glance can tell you if there is someone already in the bathroom. In the business section they keep the curtain closed. You might think no one is using the bathroom but it could be the pilot or co-pilot, but a simple glance up will show you that it is available or not.

### "sub standard inflight service"
If it wasn’t for the convenience of the timings, we would never fly air Canada Rouge again, based on our last experience. To start, the aircraft was 26 years old (Airbus 319, reg C-GARJ) and it showed. The “business class” seats were beyond worn and uncomfortable and there was no inflight entertainment or wifi. The purser/inflight director/in charge was what really made for an unbelievable experience. Sitting on my own, I was ignored on 2 separate occasions, and when I finally spoke up, I was told that she is not used to seeing passengers sitting alone and therefore didn’t notice me. Nice! Drink orders had to be repeated more than once, and overall she seemed very unprofessional. I work in the airline industry and the fact that all window blinds as far as I could see were closed during taxiing and take off which I know for a fact is against DOT regulations. The fact that I paid such an outrageous amount of money for 2 business class seats for me and my wife on this decrepit airplane with sub standard inflight service is an absolute joke and Air Canada/Rouge should be ashamed.

### “making you know you are in peasant class”
For an airline in a country that is all about inclusivity they make sure you know your place. No inflight entertainment, No wifi, Not even a USB port to charge your device. Did Air Canada have to special order a plane and ask for the USB ports to be removed? They also make sure to let you know what you are NOT getting in the announcements. The person making these announcements could be at least be a little humble or pleasant in their delivery. I get it, I was in economy, but some stuff like no USB port is Air Canada making sure to let you know you are in peasant class. Zero is not an option for the ratings, so where there is a 1 star, it is only because zero is not available and it should be as there was no entertainment or connectivity........or dare I say it, no USB port. Perhaps use this plane for cargo, wait! They are.

### "Delayed on both ends"
Delayed on both ends due to ACs scheduling. Then on top of that sat on tarmac for 45 minutes for an unplanned maintenance issue. Then they deboarded and told us we would leave in an hour. Then than became 2 hours. So a 9:30pm flight was delayed to at least 2am. Nothing open so no food or water (not even vending machines) in the airport.

### “no information, no nothing”
Not Verified | About a year ago my flight Toronto-Bogota was cancelled. Myself and probably other 200 people were lining up at the Air Canada customer service booth, to ask what to do. They closed the booth at 10pm and left myself and probably 100 people more stranded, with no information, no nothing. At the gate Air Canada employees were not able to provide any info/help either. I had to stay in Toronto's airport until next day, but still nothing. In the end I had to figure out how to get to my destination with no help from Air Canada. At that time I thought that was just a temporary thing, since I have been using Air Canada for over 2 decades with no regrets. Today, after a year, I am booking a flight using a travel advisor. She tells me that what happened to me last year is still happening to people today. That Air Canada continues to cancel flights left and right and leaves people stranded at the Airport in Toronto. That many of her clients have recently had the same experience I had a year ago.

### "told I would have to check my bag"
Not Verified |   I had another unfortunate flying experience on Rouge from YYZ to Miami due to a cancelled Delta flight. Paid a premium booking a same day which is fine, however, I booked a comfort ticket and was given row 33D. I boarded zone 3, as one of the first passengers to board in the zone and was told I would have to check my bag. I asked if it was a gate check and they said yes you check it here and it goes to the carousel (not gate check by any airline definition). Sure enough, I arrive at my seat and the luggage bin is empty and remained so for the flight. I asked the flight attendant why this constantly happens and she said “we are volunteers before the flight and don’t get paid”. By itself, it’s really not a big issue, but when you are flying 2-3 times per week waiting an hour in every city is frustrating when there is capacity for bags on the plane. I flew about 10 times of 130 total flights last year on Rouge and each and every time there is some kind of service issue not too mention I was 2 for 10 on time vs. 2 delays out of a 100 flights on Delta (this flight was delayed for over an hour). Sad to see this airline deteriorate since the pandemic.

### "unsatisfied with the level of courtesy"
Not Verified |   I was very unsatisfied with the level of courtesy from flight attendants and staff. We landed in Montreal from our 4 hour flight a bit early on July 7th. So we were instructed to sit buckled in for 15-20 minutes. I had needed to use the washroom very bad. I had got up to use the washroom while we were stopped and waiting. The flight attendants seen me making my way to the back, no one stopped me. Until I was already at the washroom door, the flight attendant had pushed the door closed from my hand and very rudely told me to go sit down. I will not recommend this airline.

### "don’t allow early boarding with Infants"
We travelled with our 6 month old baby and in Punta Cana they asked me and my family to return to the back of the line as they don’t allow early boarding with Infants. After explaining to the agent our situation she disregarded my request and asked me to go back to the line . After 10 minutes or so , another agent noticed us with the infant and asked us to go to the front of the line. Once we got to the front of the line, they made us wait until 90 percent of the plane boarded before letting us on board. Please note That my baby was screaming at this point. Please Also note that I was also traveling with my 77 year old Mother. Simply no respect. Not only we were almost one hour late for the departure from Punta Cana, once we got to Montreal they had no gate and didn’t how to get the passengers off the plane. They stated that we are waiting for Instructions. After 15 min they said we are going to get off the plane using a bus but no busses are available and another 10 min wait . Then the bus finally arrived but they made us wait in the stairs for 5 min for an unexplained reason. During our departure from Montreal to Toronto we waited 3 hours in the airport because of bad weather that delayed the plane leaving from Toronto.

### "enjoyable flight experience"
Not Verified |   We had an enjoyable flight experience with AC Rouge. The flight attendants on this crew worked very well together and demonstrated great cooperation and team work. The crew was welcoming, personable and professional. In particular, we enjoyed excellent service from Victoria and Heather.

### "the food was all gone"
My husband and I flew to Ft Lauderdale and returned to Toronto, for a Caribbean cruise. On both flights there was no food. The food trolley started with food but by the time it reached us, the food was all gone. I told the attendant, but she just shrugged and said “sorry, all the food is gone”. Luckily I had purchased chips in the airport, but was really irritated that the food supply was so inadequate. The flights were smooth and pleasant otherwise.

### "a seat assignment change"
Our flights from Houston to Quebec City were purchased on aircanada.com, and we reserved and paid for assigned seats for our traveling group of 6 (including family members, professional colleagues, and friends) on a single Air Canada booking reference. Upon arrival in Toronto, we were informed that our YYZ-YQB flight was delayed one hour because of a change of aircraft. It happens. But do note carefully: The change of aircraft was from one A321 to another A321. While one of Air Canada Rouge’s A321 may be configured slightly differently from another, the bulk of the seating is located in the economy section, and it is uniformly and predictably 6 across – 3 on each side of the center aisle. Perhaps the first-class section may be plus or minus a row or 2, which would result in the necessity of some changes of seat assignments in the economy section, but the overwhelming bulk of the seats and seat assignments need not be changed. Our assigned and paid-for seats were 19D, E, and F and 20 D, E, and F – all on the right side of the aircraft (by choice) and none were located in the front 2 rows of economy nor in the rear 2 rows of economy. As we boarded the gate agent informed us of a seat assignment change. One married couple in our group was seated together in the middle of the aircraft, but the rest of us were scattered throughout rear half of the economy section, with 5 of the 6 being in middle seats, including 3 of us in the middle seats of the last 3 rows of the aircraft. This is inexcusable. Why was our traveling-together-on-a-single-booking-reference group treated so disrespectfully? Perhaps 12 or so passengers of the entire aircraft may have needed to be moved, but why us, again I say traveling together as a group on a single booking reference? Because they could provide no explanation for the problem and were powerless to make it better, two Air Canada Rouge employees (the gate agent and a pilot!) suggested I raise the complaint.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Not Verified | We sat for 2 hours at Toronto Airport because the wrong cargo was on the plane and had to be taken off. Surely this should be double checked before loading? Also the service was poor, the staff were visiting and chatting and spilled drinks on my clothes because they were not paying attention. Bad experience for the third time with Air Canada, at least they are mostly bad so I do not have to adjust my expectations.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flight was delayed because they over booked it so we couldn't board. The plane itself was dirty there was garbage on the floor. There was no plugs or entertainment on the flight, and snack and food was over priced compared to competitors.

### “did not have food that was kid friendly”
I went on vacation with my family and they were late by 3:30 hours. Also they gave us blankets that had a weird smell, and they did not have food that was kid friendly.

### "Services have been scaled back"
Not Verified |  This flight was delayed by 35 minutes due to some passengers not wanting to check their carryon bags at the gate. Flight started ok and seats were comfortable. I was not able to log onto inflight entertainment on one android phone but was able to on an ipad. Service was good however I received the smallest cup of coffee I have ever seen. Not much bigger than an espresso up! Considering I paid $1,500 for 3 seats I could have at least gotten a descent cup of coffee. The snacks promised never appeared. The flight attendant only offered the overpriced food and a small glass of water. At least offer crackers and a cookie. When did this get deleted??? Thank good ness I packed sandwiches and brought our own water containers or I would have suffered dehydration. Services have been scaled back but ticket prices have not. Last time flying this airline.

### "Excellent short flight"
Excellent short flight, Clean and comfortable plane. Flight attendants were friendly, attentive and very professional. Boarding and deplaning were smooth.

### "Excellent and fast flight"
Excellent and fast flight. Plane left Québec on-time and arrived on-time in Montréal. Friendly flight attendants. Plane was clean. The use of A319-100 is an improvement compare to the former plane (Bombardier Q-400) on service on this route before.

### "so understaffed and unprepared"
Not Verified | Currently sitting on runway for 1 hour. When we landed captain said it would be 5 min. How can you make people pay 1000’s of dollars and be so understaffed and unprepared. Its criminal. We are crammed in on this plane like sardines. Worst flight ever. Shameful service Air Canada!

### "There is no space to move at all"
This company is a complete joke. Both flights were delayed. 10 years ago, Air Canada came up with Rouge to be able to compete with a few low costs company who were supposed to be starting across Canada. 10 years later, they sell their tickets 1200$ Montreal- Miami: you get the low cost comfort and service but at a full price. Please, get rid of this awful company. Passengers are seated like animals. There is no space to move at all. The legroom is very small and the seats are not comfortable.

### "could not believe the unprofessionalism"
I could not believe the unprofessionalism of the cabin crew on this flight. I am frequent flyer and often do 1 or 2 round trips between North and South America per year, usually through Air Canada. This was my first Air Canada rouge experience and I hope to never have another like this again. I found it a little strange that the flight attendants stood at the door as passengers were boarding but they were not greeting anyone, just standing and watching people board. The flight was 4.5 hours from Kelowna to Toronto and it left at midnight so passengers wanted to sleep. I was shocked when I woke up partway through to the sound of loud laughing and women’s voices talking and swearing. I thought it must be passengers in a nearby row. However, I glanced toward the back of the plane and saw all of the flight attendants standing together chatting with no regard for the passengers trying to sleep. I’m sure the whole back half of the aircraft could hear them. Again, as passengers exited the aircraft, the attendants stood at the door but their attention was on each other as they continued chatting to one another and ignoring the departing guests. I’ve never seen a cabin crew act this unprofessional before. I would recommend avoid booking with Air Canada rouge.

### "The service was excellent"
The flight was affordable and a good value for money. The service was excellent. The seats were spacious and comfortable for economy compared to other airlines. There were no screens in the seats and charging ports were tough to find as they were at the bottom of the seats. However, in flight movies through our phones was good. Along with the wifi and texting in flight for free for Aeroplan members was a nice luxury for economy. Our pilot Heather was awesome. Very comfortable take off and landing.

### "I’m clearly owed a refund"
Ground and flight crews were excellent. Flight was efficient and comfortable. But I’ll never fly Air Canada (Rouge or otherwise) again. This was originally a BOS-YYT itinerary via YUL. 11 hrs before departure, at 23:15, we got texts that the BOS-YUL flight was cancelled. We were offered rebooking more than a day later, via Halifax with a very tight connection. We opted to DRIVE to Montreal instead and catch the original second leg, but AC had already removed us from that flight. There was no way to rebook this online, no chat, no reply to DM - only the reservations toll-free number, which I called at midnight. I spoke with an agent at 3:30 am - I was on hold for 3.5 hrs. She restored the booking, but not the seats; my wife and I were separated on the flight. We drove at 7am and caught the flight out of YUL. At the airport, we tried to find a desk that could give us info about a refund for the BOS-YUL-BOS legs. We were told that could only be done via the reservations till-free number. There was no booking desk at the airport. And still no reply to DMs. After we completed the trip and drove home from Montreal, now 9 days after the flight was cancelled - no word about the refund. So I called again , and spent two more hours on hold. The agent who finally answered said he had no idea how refunds work, they would need to pro-rate the refund. There was no way to contact them, no idea when I’d hear anything. He “resubmitted” the file to refunds dept. There’s no online chat, DMs don’t work, executives don’t reply to emails, there’s no desk at the airport and the call center is clearly understaffed. I’m clearly owed a refund for the flight they cancelled - but have no idea how much or whether I’ll see it in days or months. Nobody takes responsibility. It’s a shame, because the flight experience itself was lovely. But this airline is a mess.

### "awful customer service"
Air Canada Rouge isn't a bad flight agency, and the flights themselves were okay. However I'm giving a low review because of how they handled our delay. We missed a flight due to delays and got stuck in the Toronto Pearson airport overnight. We had my ONE YEAR OLD nephew with us, and there were no amenities to help feed him, keep him comfortable and transport him. I tried to go to customer service to see about a hotel, and they closed the kiosk with about 30 people still in line, telling us we would have to leave the secured part of the airport to talk to customer service out there. It was awful customer service, and I didn't want to abandon my sister with a baby and all our luggage to look after while I tried to get us somewhere to stay. My poor nephew screamed all morning since he had nowhere to sleep and couldn't settle with how busy the airport was, even in the early hours of the morning. My sister had never flown before and this was an awful experience for her. It's clear that Air Canada doesn't care about their passengers and only wants money. To top it all off, from Fort McMurray to Toronto, there was a screaming child seated directly behind me who screamed the entire 4.5 hour flight, and screamed so loudly that he woke my otherwise silent nephew and made him cry. I understand that babies can't help their crying, but the caretakers did absolutely nothing to help him, and the flight attendants permitted it when this baby literally ran up and down the aisle of the air plane while screaming. This baby also stood up on his seat and pulled my hair, yet not a peep was spoken to the caretaker by the staff.

### "our experience was extremely disappointing"
Not Verified |  On our departure from Mexico to return to Montreal, we were shocked to find that our seats were not guaranteed on our flight. In fact, when checking in at Cancun airport, we find that we don't have a seat. The letters SBY are indicated as seat. By going to ask the question to the representative of our airline company while going to carry our luggage, he tells us that we do not have a seat yet, that we are on standby and that we will have to present ourselves 10 minutes at our boarding gate before boarding begins to check with another employee of our airline to ask them for a status report. We were so frustrated with the situation and the lack of explanation from our airline. The employee didn't seem convinced that we had a seat on the plane even though we had an outward flight and a return flight when we had booked our trip to a resort in Mexico with our travel agent. Moreover, it was not our first time on a plane. We knew how it worked and we had never experienced such a situation. So we headed to our gate and waited for the right moment. Even when it was time to go see the employee at the boarding gate, she didn't seem to know what to say other than "probably the system" Finally, my partner and I were called to the gate and finally got seats on the plane. So imagine, arriving at the airport and learning that your seats are on standby. First time in my life that I have lived this! Also, it was not the first time we had flown with this airline. On the other hand, positive point, all the flight attendants on the outward and return plane were very nice and professional. Nothing to say on this side! Unfortunately, our experience with the airline was extremely disappointing. Our travel agent did not understand why we did not have a seat on the return plane.

### "Both flights were delayed"
Not Verified | Flew Air Canada Rouge twice this week. Booked thinking I was flying Air Canada. Knew nothing about the “rouge” brand. Both flights were delayed. They did not have sufficient time between flights to properly move planes or service them. Both flights were delayed. So 100% chance of delay. Rude staff who will cut the customers needing extra time off. The flight attendants made a guest put two bags below their seat so they could accommodate one guest who wouldn’t find her own open bag spot. Very rude service. First flight, boarded an hour late then sat for an hour waiting to push back as they didn’t have weights to fly. No offer of drinks or anything.

### "take you to where you need"
They will take you to where you need. Nevertheless, in the months before the flights we had a few time changes. At the airport we had to show vaccination records four times despite the fact that we uploaded it to their app. The boarding zone system is confusing and separating family members. On the way back there was an hour delay from Narita and a gate change in Montreal. Now there is another delay in the transit to Newark. I paid for wifi from Japan to Canada and it didn't work.

### "we had to leave our two daughters behind"
Not Verified |  One of the worst experiences of my life. Our first flight after the pandemic to visit family for Christmas. We purchased these tickets 4 months ahead for our family of 4 as Christmas presents, so we could all go and relax and enjoy family time. The night before our flight we could only check in my husband and myself, it was giving us a note that we needed to come see someone at the counter upon arriving to the airport. We went very early the next day, try to check in our daughters again and the same notice came up. So we went to find out what the issue was and a guy at customer service very rude and unpleasant, notify us like nothing that the two tickets for our daughters were sold out to their own staff. I could NOT understand what was happening at the same time and why would they do that to tickets that were already paid 4 months ahead of time. Anyways after arguing and actually crying we had to leave our two daughters behind waiting there to get accommodations for the next day on the evening. With the loss of two days of their flights and my agony as a mother we left them behind. Because they could not accommodate all of us on the same flights now because everything was sold out. We wrote to Air Canada a complaint and the excuse was because of the weather their flight was delay. Not knowing that we already knew that the tickets were re-sold to accommodate their own employees. I will never like to use their service again. That was cold, calculated, irresponsible and lack of respect and responsibility to their customers

### "12 hours waiting at the airport"
Not Verified | Flying two adults and a toddler. Summary of my experience: 12 hours waiting at the airport getting messages every hour that my flight was delayed. Cancelled flight at 10 pm and Air Canada did not offer a hotel. No meals offered. Customer service did not answer the phone. No one available to discuss my issue.

### "worst airline experience I have had"
Likely the worst airline experience I have had, outbound YYZ to PHX on Dec 15, 2022 Air Canada suggested that we arrive at YYZ at least 3 hours before AC 1721 for a 9:25 departure, so we staggered in at about 6:15. At 7:23 the flight was delayed until 9:20 We then boarded the plane and waited on the tarmac for about an hour. Then we were ordered off the plane and told to take everything with us. At 10:14 the flight was delayed until 12:30. Gate agent scolded passengers because someone had used the plane's lavatory while it was on the ground, and apparently that was the cause for the delay. As if it's the first time in the history of air travel that someone used the plane's toilet before it left the ground. At 10:30 the flight was delayed until 1:30 At 11:25 the flight was cancelled and we were re-booked on AC 1723. Our seats were separated by 14 rows. No refund for premium seat selection that was denied because of the cancellation At 2:26 there was a gate change At 4:17 there was another gate change At 5:21 that flight was delayed until 8:15 Wheels-up after 9 pm. We arrived at our destination about 12 hours late. Compensation offered? A $10 meal voucher. I have travelled all over the world, and dealt with scores of airlines and hundreds of airline personnel. I have never met with such rudeness and condescension as I have with Air Canada Rouge. Worst Airline Experience Ever

### "onboard service was excellent"
Not Verified |  First time flying the 737 MAX and I cannot say I was impressed. The seat configuration is terrible. Misaligned with windows. The aisle is narrow, felt sorry for the attendants serving food and drink. The bathroom was terrible, a person of size would have problems entering. The overhead compartments are of better design. We sat in preferred and the seats have virtually no padding what so ever. The flight itself went fine and the onboard service was excellent.

### "I would not hesitate to book again"
The queueing to board is haphazardly organized whenever I fly Air Canada, but overall I have no criticisms. Our seats, 21A/C, had really excellent legroom with a lot of room in the footwell and a clean window. There was no seatback TV, but instead a really handy clip to hold your iPad. Service is PAYGO, so it is a bit intrusive when they're selling food, and the seats could stand to have a bit more padding, but for a domestic transcon flight it was quite good enough for 4-5 hours and I would not hesitate to book again. Baggage was handled properly with no issues.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible! Would never use this airline again! They lost the luggage of 30 passengers (including me). Said that unfortunately they forgot to board the luggage on the flight. I'm still waiting for my luggage 3 days later, with no clothes, no medicine (that I need to use daily) and no answers! Horrible customer service, horrible service! Never again!

### "left us stranded"
Cancelled our flight two days before a hurricane was anywhere nearby citing bad weather, meanwhile Air Transat and other liners continued to fly passengers out on the exact same route for the next few days no issues whatsoever. Air Canada left us stranded and to fend for ourselves, offering absolutely nothing but an apology email. To further aggravate our desperate situation our local AC representative, asked us to wait an additional day for more information from him before securing a spot in a hotel for an extended stay. Unbelievably, the essential information that we were waiting for was that we're out of luck and that it was not his problem. As you can imagine by the tone of this review, we are still trapped in the Dominican riding out a hurricane that has only just begun to touchdown. Hoping and praying to fly out in two days, unless they cancel that flight as well. The credit card can only take so many extended bookings.

### "quite appalled by the service"
Traveled Air Canada rouge from Bridgetown to Toronto and back to BGI. To YYZ was not bad as there was just a slight delay. On the way back to BGI the staff was not understanding as I was traveling with medication and the scales were off as I had to use 2 different scales that gave different weights and I had to move around items and was advised I would have to pay $100 cad for 1lb of overweight. The staff were rude and very nonchalant about it. I requested fragile stickers for my luggage my luggage was brand new and there were a few items in my luggage that could break. When I received my luggage a it was dented and a wheel was off. I'm quite appalled by the service received as ticket price were extremely expensive seeing the space given for seating and no entertainment, having to pay for wifi and even water.

### "anything to avoid this plane next time"
Air Canada rouge told me that I can’t carry my instrument like that for security purposes and refused to hear anything I had to say. The staff told me that I didn’t register my instrument and refused to listen to me when I tried to tell him that I did (my instrument even had an Air Canada tag on it). I specially checked on each airport to be sure that I will have no issue. He threatened to take me out of the plane and acted with authority if I refused to cooperate with his plan of inserting my acoustic musical instrument between hard cases in the compartment above the seats. There were 4 empty seats in front of me under which I could have inserted my instrument securely. Staff simply cut all communication canals, inserted my instrument in the worst possible place, and told me Air Canada is not responsible for any damage. I will do anything to avoid this plane next time I will travel from Quebec.

### "never travel this airline again"
Not Verified |  They make you check your bags for a fee of 30 USD plus fees. Hence no traveller wants to pay this fee, and you therefore have 130+ people bringing on a carry on suit case. There simply is not enough room. Customers getting frustrated with one another when people move bags without asking. We left late due to the debacle of trying to find room for these bags. Not good when we are already going to be arriving back into Toronto after 11.30pm. Then they ask you take anything that is not a wheely suitcase and put it by your feet, which serves to only reduce the meagre leg room provided on these flight. What with zero entertainment and wifi that we have to pay for, I will never travel this airline again. Air Canada you should be ashamed that you operate this service showing your name.

### "denied access to my carry"
I flew to Canada with Akr Canada from Ft Lauderdale, USA on September 1, flight number is AC 1605 and departure time was 15.05 and the check in crews were very rude. They denied access to my carry on so I had to check it in and it had many valuables inside. Once I was in the plane, I realized my carry on will fit with no problem and plane was not full and many overhead bins. I have been traveling everywhere to Europe etc and they never denied my carry on and I know this is pure discrimination. The guy that worked that day was the worst and I am so sorry I didn't ask his name. While people were in line he walked toward the line and checked every passenger suitcases that were in line to lift and weigh them with his arms to figure out whether they were heavy enough or not and I never seen such thing like that my whole life traveling across continents. Air Canada you treat customers that are not Canadians like we flew for free. We paid for tickets. The same guy that denied my carry on insisting on that was too big. Once in the cabin, I have seen similar suitcases that were like mine.

### "The customer service is horrible"
Not Verified |  Air Canada is the worst airline I have ever flown with. My family of four flew to Athens, Greece from New York and Chicago with a connection at Toronto. In addition to long delays, Air Canada forced us to check in our carry-ons. One of my son's suitcase never made it to Greece. Ten days later and we have no word about where the suitcase is. At the beginning we were told that the suitcase went to Paris but its traces got lost after that. The customer service is horrible. We spent many hours trying to call an Air Canada number we were given but nobody answered the phone after waiting on the line for over one hour at a time. Air Canada ruined our vacation. We will never use this airline in the future. Stay away.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified | Madrid to New York via Toronto. Air Canada has the worst customer service and - well, service in general - of any airline I've ever flown on. Countless delays followed by several cancelled flights, no help from "customer service", non-existent support when you try to call and make contact. I could go on and on and on. Plus good luck trying to get reimbursed for their incompetence. This is basically a criminal organization masquerading as an airline. Avoid at all costs.

### "the Premium is simply a scam"
Not Verified |  Booked and paid for Premium Economy seats, but due to their wrong rows numbering, got regular seats. Food was no different from other passengers. So the Premium is simply a scam. The flight attendant was rude. She likely missed the class how to be courteous and how make passengers feel good. I am a frequent traveller so I am qualified to say Air Canada is from far, my worst flying experience ever.

### "avoid Air Canada if at all possible"
Unfortunately here to share a negative experience with Air Canada. I flew out from Toronto (YYZ) to Fort Lauderdale (FLL) on June 22, 2022, Flight 1628. To begin with, as sprawling as Pearson Airport is the signage is lacking and honestly not clear at all, so it was extremely confusing to figure out exactly where we needed to go just to check in for our specific flight. Air Canada's ground customer service was painfully slow and inefficient - I get there are staffing shortages with the pandemic aftermath, but this was a little excessive. Our flight boarded a few minutes behind schedule which wasn't the end of the world, but we were scheduled to take off at 4.45pm and did not take off until almost 7.00pm! All of us literally sat on the tarmac going nowhere for over 2 hours! The cabin crew was essentially clueless and the pilot kept giving one excuse after another for the delay which didn't even make sense. Every passenger was pretty agitated about the situation, to say the least...we finally took off way behind schedule and did not make it into Fort Lauderdale until almost 10.00pm (original landing time was 7.45pm). The flight itself was OK. At least on AC Rouge, I found the legroom to be mediocre, and the seating marginally comfortable. Flight attendants were generally polite, but not necessarily friendly. Overall, this is my second experience flying Air Canada. My first time was in 2015 going to/from Montreal and I also dealt with poor customer service then, so I should have learned my lesson, but I hope this cautions other potential fliers to avoid Air Canada if at all possible - especially if your travel plans are not flexible or if you need to catch a connecting flight!

### "They kept changing the flight time"
Worst experience ever. They kept changing the flight time, we had to over go a delay of one hour and when we finally got to the airport we waited for an extra one hour because there was another plane in our spot. Not recommended.

### "Multiples change and revised time"
Quebec to Montreal. Multiples change and revised time because of technical issue. Never again will I use Air Canada Rouge or Air Canada if I have other choice.

### "Horrible airline"
Not Verified | Toronto to Montego Bay. Horrible airline. Only airline that’s still priced with the market and they have NO power outlets. No snacks at all even on a 4 hour flight. Flight attendants seemed stressed. Would never use again if another airline was available. Disappointed at the corners they cut.

### "Worst flight ever"
Worst flight ever! First off no entertainment at all not even charger port not even a usb plug.! The seat was so uncomfortable and I had a preferred seat? I was sore all over from that flight. The snack part annoyed me, when am flying to Jamaica with a air bistro voucher it's a meal and 2 snacks but, when am flying back to Toronto it's a meal and 1 snack for the same price. I am in shock that any sun destination you pick with Air Canada you're stuck with Air Canada Rouge. Absolutely terrible. The staff was cold and stand offish. Never again will I fly this airline.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. Before our flight they said there is technical issues in the airline I have record of that site was showing too. Then an other issue then weather problem finally they called cancelled flight. I got rebooked again through Expedia, now I am at New York, no one knows where is my checked in luggage.

### "flight back to Toronto was horrible"
Not Verified |  The flight to arrive to Tampa was great. The flight back to Toronto was horrible. The seats weren't in great shape, no chargers for phones. Very outdated. Thankfully I charged my phone at the airport while waiting. There was also so many carry on bags from other passengers that I was a unable to pack my carry on in the proper area of the plane. Maybe counting stowed carry on bags should be implemented. Also, I know this is common but the back of the plane should be boarded first I’m confused why this isn’t a thing. Waiting in lines for people to put their luggage up and hitting every other passenger on the way to the back of the plane. Rough.

### "will never ever use again"
Toronto to Holguin. If you want to ruin your vacation and not get the compensation you can choose Air Canada. This if the right company to help you with it. Also you will have a lot of troubles to get in touch with reps to try to resolve any problems with either Air Canada or Air Canada Vacation. I will never ever use this company again.

### "missing my connection to Tampa with United"
Not Verified |  My initial Jazz flight July 23 left 2hours late from Vancouver, which lead to missing my connection to Tampa with United. After 2 hours in the United airlines customer service line up, I was informed that there was nothing that United could do because Air Canada was in control of the ticket and they were the only ones that could rebook me on the next flight. This has to be the WORST policy because there was not an air Canada agent anywhere in the Denver airport to be found. I had no idea how to get this problem solved. After and exhausting search, I was so distraught that I left the secured area and after more attempts to find an air Canada agent I went to the United Airlines check in counter. The United agent (Carol Ann) went above and beyond to help me and while she was on hold with Air Canada she was busy checking in customers for a departing flight. She finally was successful in being able to provide me with a boarding pass onto a flight leaving to Tampa the following morning. How is it possible that United Airlines can be an alliance (partner) when they do not have authority to get Air Canada passengers where they are booked to go when the passenger has an existing boarding pass. If passengers who find themselves in this situation are supposed to know to call air Canada, then that is also a poor policy. I do not roam with my phone and certainly not going to pay for cell minutes to hold for Who knows how long?

### "refusing to offer me a refund"
I asked for a refund for unnecessary costs incurred on July 9, 2021. The original flight was scheduled for July 8, 2021 and I had obtained a COVID test on July 6th which was negative. The fight from West Palm Beach to Washington was delayed about one hour and a half due to bad weather and therefore the connection to Toronto was missed by a few minutes. The notation on the display boards indicated that it was still boarding but it had departed by the time I got to the gate. I feel that the airlines must know that there are people wanting to connect on any fight and know which flights are delayed and which flights are arriving, therefore could have waited about 15 minutes to half an hour longer. A United Airlines customer service representative confirmed me on the earliest flight possible to Toronto which was the next day at 4:30 p.m. Was that the first possible flight with any airline or any connection? SO I had to stay at a hotel in the Dulles area from July 8th to July 9th. When I got to the Air Canada check in the next day I was still within the 72 hour limit for the COVID test and the attendant told me that they went by the flight departure time - which I had no control over - which was 4:30 p.m. a time difference of only a few hours. SO I had to take a RAPID COVID TEST which cost $250 U.S. at the Dulles airport right then. Since the world has been battling this pandemic for over a year now, there has been a practice of quarantining for 14 days as the virus take 14 days to be established. Therefore why would another test on July 9th, show anything but a negative result? I now have paid close to $500 U.S. for the two tests with a last vaccination date of April 1, 2021. I do not want to pay this extra $250 simply because the person at the check-in was young and overly officious, and making a capricious and arbitrary decision. They are refusing to offer me a refund of $450 Canadian for the hotel stay on July 8th and a second Covid test on July 9th.

### "He was courteous and efficient"
Not Verified |  My husband and I had a return flight to Montreal on january 14. For personal reason we needed to cancel our flights . Air Canada employee Alberto Colagrosso took care of cancelling our travel arrangements. He was courteous and efficient. With these difficult times which we are going through, people tend to be very impatient however Mr. Colagrosso was very patient and understanding. Thank you Air Canada for hiring competent employee.

### "Crew were professional, friendly and accommodating"
Not Verified |  I have to say having flown Air Canada rouge a handful of times (international, trans-border), I haven't had a negative experience with their Premium Rouge ('business class') product. The latest flight was a return leg from Montego Bay (AC1805) to Toronto, the aircraft was two years old, and extremely clean, obviously. Crew were professional, friendly and accommodating. F&B quality and service was excellent. A very pleasant travel experience during very trying times.

### "I have had missing/delayed bags"
Not Verified |  I make a round trip flight to South America at least 2x per year. When AC Rouge first started, I loved flying with them. Then they upgraded their planes with thinner seats and less recline, (unfortunately most airlines have made this upgrade). I find it rather ironic that they did this, when every study on air rage, shows that more comfort (aka more leg room and seat recline), reduces stress and air rage. So they did the exact opposite of what every study said they should do. So not only have they made a long haul flight, less comfort able, the prices have also been steadily creeping upwards, (I used to buy first class for what you now pay in premium economy). As a whole, the cabin crew has always been great to me, but you always get the odd one who may be having a bad day and are a bit more abrasive. When Rouge first started flying, I never had an issue with missing or delayed baggage. The last 4 flights I have had missing/delayed bags. In summery, AC Rouge is a typical low cost carrier that cuts costs where they can. They used to be exceptional, but now they are below average.

### "good value for money"
We were on holiday visiting both Toronto and Las Vegas. It's not often you get to fly on a 767 in Europe anymore and I was looking forward to this trip on one even though I know they are showing their age. The airport in Toronto was efficient and relatively quiet and it was good that we could do the US immigration pre-clearance there. Boarding was quite fast given the number of people. But after we boarded the cabin crew had to work very hard to find hold space for all of the carry-on bags which led to frustrated passengers and the plane was uncomfortably hot while all this was going on. The 767 did look old and a bit tatty but actually my seat was comfortably and I nodded off and before long we were in Vegas. I thought the flight was good value for money given the distance we were covering - nearly 2,000 miles I think. Baggage arrived quickly in Vegas airport too.

### "no compensation given"
I'm writing this on behalf of my mom and dad, who had a trip booked to Vancouver from Las Vegas. Unfortunately, a month before the trip date, they weren't able to fly anymore due to my mother's stage 4 cancer diagnosis. There was no compensation given for the canceled flight. Not a credit.

### "has to be the best time ever"
Not Verified |  Winnipeg to Punta Cana via Toronto. Me and my family have flown many times on Air Canada and Air Canada rouge but this has to be the best time ever. When we left Winnipeg the flight attendant noticed that my mother has trouble walking so she talked to the ground staff in Winnipeg who then called Toronto and arranged a wheel chair for her when we landed to get us to our next flight. We could have made it on our own but the compassion and care that this flight staff gave to us really made our whole family’s day.

### "should allow some compensation"
Toronto to Phoenix. 8:55 a.m. departure on AC 1836. 90 Minute delay originally posted. Then we get on plane actually go through de-icing and then we are told the lavatories don't work and we need maintenance. Back to the terminal. Then we are told we all have the right to deplane after ages on the tarmac. Final announcement is that we all need to deplane as the pilots have gone over time. We get off plane and are only told the plane will leave at 2 p.m. (originally an 8:55 a.m. flight). We were told our tickets served as vouchers for food. This actually worked, but in the end we are delayed 6.5 hours headed to a long weekend getaway in Phoenix - lost a complete day at resort but resort still wants its daily fee. We are offered nothing else yet the Passengers Bill of Rights should allow some compensation for delays over 5 hours that are the fault of the airline.

### "extremely bad experience"
We were flying back from Orlando to Toronto, originally boarding time 4:10pm and scheduled to land before 8pm. We received multiple notifications about flight delays, each time saying it will be delayed approximately 1 hour. notifications kept coming as we waited with uncertainty, until finally it states plane would arrive at approx. 1:15am. At one point, after 11pm, it seemed like they were trying to genuinely expedite things for us, saying flight will arrive in 30 minutes and do quick turn around. 30 minutes later, another delay saying have to wait for 2 flight attendants to come in, 30 minutes away. another 30 minutes later, they said they are waiting for another attendant to come in, about 30 minutes away! Feels like just making excuses and in the end, boarding time remained unchanged at 1:15 approx. We were not offered any vouchers for meals. Once plane arrived, gate attendant did not show any sympathy regarding the passengers' frustration, but rather demanded and threatened that attendants be treated respectfully and politely, otherwise would turn plane around and none of the passengers will board. Gate attendant was rude, ignoring our questions and requests. If people are not completely frustrated by now, then I can't think of a better way to agitate everyone. Finally arrived back at Toronto around 4:30. after picking up luggages and passing customs, arrived home at 5:30. Unfortunately, had to go to work exhausted. Overall, extremely bad experience.

### "Wonderful service provided"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Wonderful service provided on Flight 1626 on March 1st. Blair and Freedom really went out of their way to make sure the passengers had an enjoyable flight. After a delay of over an hour the passengers were getting a bit angry but these flight attendants really worked hard to keep their passengers happy and smiled all the way through it!

### "complaint about cabin announcements"
I have a complaint about cabin announcements made on AC Rouge Flight 1659 Tampa to Toronto on Feb 16, 2020. Safety and advisory oral messages were given at garbled high speed, heavily accented and were next to unintelligible to me. Cabin communications must be clearly enunciated, at a moderate speed and presented in a serious manner.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  I was a bit wary about flying Air Canada Rouge. Numerous comments and reviews and without question the majority of those comments / reviews were negative. I flew from my home in Kelowna (central B.C.) to Edmonton then to Toronto on an A321. I was pleasantly surprised by this aircraft, spotlessly clean and the seating (I was in regular economy for this part of my trip ) was spacious and comfortable. The cabin crew were delightful, quite young and very friendly and efficient, service was very good. The next part of my trip was Toronto to Glasgow, an evening flight on an older Boeing 767, I was in premium economy. There was a separate cabin for premium economy, I had two large seats to myself. The food was excellent, a lovely meal served with a nice imported red wine, service was top class, well done ladies! On these older 767's there is no in flight entertainment, that is simply an issue that you should be aware of prior to booking. I knew that so I downloaded a couple of good movies from Netflix to my tablet and I had a good pair of comfortable headphones. I sat back and enjoyed the flight, had a couple of nice highballs and then a couple of hours nap before landing in Glasgow. All in all an enjoyable experience flights were right on time, if there was anything negative it was landing in Glasgow at 6.30 in the morning. My return flight was Glasgow to Heathrow then on to Vancouver in premium economy again top notch. I'm away again this September to Glasgow, my travel agent found me a very good fare with Air Canada in premium economy.

### "Rude, impatient and dismissive treatment"
Not Verified |  Ottawa to Tampa. Absolutely the worst experience flying with any airline. Seats so tight together that my sore arthritic knees were forced up against the seat in front of me. The tray table if I had been able to use it would have hit me in the chest. I have been flying since I was 5 years old and so I have 55 years experience when I say that flying has never been so uncomfortable. Top this off with the rudeness we were met with everywhere we turned, especially at check in at the Air Canada counter in Ottawa. Rude, impatient and dismissive treatment. It was truly a horrible experience. Because of the lack of space it was very warm and made us feel claustrophobic. The passengers on the flight kept getting out of their seats as a result. My husband was hit by the cart each time it went by. We are people not cattle.

### "waiting on a stationary plane"
Not Verified | Toronto to Bogota. Do you like waiting on a stationary plane for hours and hours? Are you allergic to water, food, and other simple luxuries? Do you hate getting to a hotel that you've already paid for the day after you were supposed to? If you answered yes to these questions, then boy, do I have an airline for you!

### "crew are not helpful at all"
Toronto to West Palm Beach. I have flown AC for a few weeks now and noticed they have no on-time arrival statistics because they are continually late. There are tremendous inefficiencies at the gate and on boarding crew, they are not helpful at all. They smile and speak two languages but that does not assist passengers trying to figure out where to put their luggage when there is no room left. Their website is difficult to navigate and the link to Aeroplan is less than stellar. They also are not very accommodating making sure folks stay hydrated in the air. Trying to call or electronically communicate forget it, no answer. Unfortunately, the price of the tickets is no different than any other airline. It does show when there are no regulations and big corporations like Air Canada can do what they want and treat their customers any way they choose. Sometimes a little regulation goes a long way. There are no watchdogs on this airline!

### "attendants were rude to me"
Toronto to Belize, delayed by 48 minutes. The flight attendants were rude to me. We were told to get our own alcoholic beverages from the back of the plane when asking for a refill. On our second flight there was no beer on a 5hour flight. Our 4 flights with Air Canada during our vacation was delayed or rescheduled. The airline overbooks flights and then asks people to wait until the next day to fly out.

### "subpar in their customer service"
Almost all the AC staff were subpar in their customer service treatment. I remember asking for a tissue on the way back as I was quite sick and the air hostess said she would help after serving the food. So I waited and nothing. I didn't bother reminding her again. I used the restroom. Later on during the flight I had a question and pressed the button and nothing. I understand staff get busy and that's no problem. However, I pressed that button over 5 times throughout the flight and not a single host came to address my inquiry. From the moment we tried to board until the very end, there wasn't a single rep I could give a shout out to. The attitude was aggressive and arrogant. A little mindfulness goes a long way and the staff in my opinion need to significantly up their game. The job isn't merely to serve food on the plane but to make sure all travellers are respected and responded to with basic kindness. Of course this is just my one such experience; there may have been others out there who've had a pleasant experience with this airline.

### "attendants are snappy and rude"
Not Verified |  
Toronto to Orlando. We had a bad experience on our previous AC flight back in April 2019. We paid extra to have bulkhead seats on our flight to Orlando. Gate agent came up to us after we were seated and demanded that I vacate the seat I paid for to allow a teen with a broken leg to sit on the bulkhead aisle. Didn't even ask. He said one of us had to move. Rude and condescending was what I got for refusing to do so, and a warning that I could be removed from the flight with MY attitude. Fast forward Jan 2020, and again I find myself on an AC Rouge flight. The attendants are snappy and rude when I ask for water before the aircraft begins to taxi. Rude is what I got when an attendant took my back pack out of the overhead bin to allow a late arrival's small suitcase to be put in its place. Now I have to sit with my back pack at fit, on a tiny seat, with tiny leg room, because the late women's suitcase is bigger. Never again wil I fly Air Canada. I will happily pay extra to fly a better airline, or fly out of Buffalo. BTW, I'm still waiting for my water.

### "unethical, irresponsible"
Toronto to Honolulu. I was threatened of cancellation 3 times and had to re-purchase my ticket each time thanks to some flawed algorithm the airline uses. I received emails stating that it was potentially a fraudulent purchase, and I needed to come to the airline in person to show ID, otherwise, I would be cancelled within 48 hours prior to travel. I was not refunded any money either, just informed of this. Because I was traveling with a young child and a party of 4 others, I had no choice (otherwise I'd have bought another ticket with a different airline). I drove 2 hours out of my way in order to do this, and when I got to the airport the Air Canada representative told me I had to repurchase the tickets. I told him I was not refunded, and he insisted that "the money was on its way. This was 3 weeks ago, so essentially I paid double for my tickets and had to drive way out of my way in inclement weather to do so. This is the worst airline ever - unethical, irresponsible, and fraudulent.

### "Entertainment on your own device"
Not Verified |  Lima to Toronto. Not sure why we deserved a budget airline service when travelling on such a long cross-continent flight. We had a snack and a meal included. The planes are dated, no way to set your own temperature. Tiny overhead cabin storage and small seat pitch. Entertainment was on your own device, which was not clear when booking or checking-in. The ground service was horrendous. At check-in where we were quizzed on our trip to Peru (despite leaving and heading to Canada) with questions designed to trip us up and stickers placed on the passports with sellotape and we were told to never remove them. We were submitted to random patdowns and bag searches at the departure gate, delaying the flight. Apparently this was at the request of Canadian security services (although we saw it set up at gates for US-bound flights too) but it was odd and when happening at 3am local time, quite disorientating.

### "better than I was expecting"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Montego Bay. Morning flight, delayed by an hour. Premium Rouge class, seat 1A, was better than I was expecting. Decent leg room, breakfast consisting of fruit and oatmeal tasty, and cabin staff friendly and attentive. Compared to my return leg via WestJet Premium, Rouge Premium was a close second. Would consider a second trip with them although I won’t recommend to others due to an over abundance of negative reviews - and I think I may have just got lucky. I’d need some further travel using Rouge.

### "take only one carry-on luggage"
Got my round trip flight to Tampa from Toronto through Hotwire. They offered me one free checked bag plus one carry-on for the trip. Air Canada did not honour the offer. I had to take only one carry-on luggage. In Toronto they checked in my carry–on luggage for free as the airplane was full. In return flight, they charged me $24 US for the same luggage while they were announcing the airplane was full and they did check in all carry-on luggage free of charge! We had 2:30 hours delay in Toronto to Tampa and 35 minutes delay in Tampa to Toronto.

### "I think it’s time to up the ante"
The whole process from start to finish was a nightmare. 1) First of all I thought I had Pre-booked my seats for this flight and wanted to confirm with Air Canada. I tried to call in to Air Canada and after 2 hours of waiting on hold I gave up. 2) 24 hours later I was able to book my seats and found I was sitting in a middle seat on the 27th row. I always want to sit close to the front and sit in an aisle. I was very upset and could not change it. 3) Getting to the airport they would not accept my pre registered booking as my husbands middle name was put backwards (first and last name was correct.) We tried to register on the machines but it would not issue a ticket for my husband. We had to wait over 1 hour in a line up to get our ticket. 4) From there we had to run through security and terminals to get there just in time to board. 5) We finally got onto a cramped Rouge plane filled with crying children all around us. So cramped you could hardly get through the passage. In truth I felt like a cattle of animals. There was barely room for your legs. Food and drinks were non existent until the last 40 min of the flight. This was truly one of the worst trips I have taken. WestJet in my opinion offers better service, leg rooom and comforts. I think it’s time to up the ante. I fly approx 12-14 times a year and this honestly was one of the worst flights I ever had.

### "thought we'd be alright without money"
Miami to Toronto. It was our family's last day of vacation in Miami Beach and our rental car was broken into and our cash, credit cards, bank cards, DL's, iPads taken. The only saving grace was our passports were not taken. After hours of sorting things out with the Miami PD, insurance and the bank we had $0 and still many hours to go before our flight. I thought we'd be alright without any money until we got home. Then we went to the airport, go to check in at the electronic kiosk which included our 1 check in bag which cost $22US, I had forgotten about that cost. I went up spoke to the Air Canada rep and explained the situation. I offered to pay the following day if possible, I made no progress with her so asked to speak with her supervisor. She went away and came back and passed along the following message from her supervisor. Her final answer, "Sorry, there is just nothing we can do. You will just have to leave your suitcase here. You can just take your stuff out of the suitcase and wear what you can. I asked to speak with the supervisor and was told she was busy on the phone and while we waited for her to come out another passenger who overheard our situation offered to pay for our checked in luggage. These actions make a difference that you just cant explain, such a thoughtful gesture from some really incredible people. I will be paying this forward tenfold.

### "Rouge plane isn’t fit for purpose"
Not Verified |  I have flown this segment (TOR-Victoria) a number of times. I used to commute Toronto to London, UK and typically paid less for that flight segment (even buying less than a week’s notice). This Rouge plane isn’t fit for purpose: seats are falling apart, no legroom, no food (5 hour flight? ), no screens, we bus out to the tarmac from AC’s hub at Pearson, the plane never leaves on time - the entire experience is borderline - criminal. I’d love to see ACs CEO saddle up for this experience in economy. The least he could do is put a proper plane/gate on the route.

### "don't have any additional food"
Toronto to Barcelona. Purchasing the tickets was a complete nightmare. The website kept getting errors and I could not book the dates I wanted. Customer service helped me over the phone advised they apologized and because of the Mishap they would place me in a better seat free of charge with extra legroom. I am in the plane right now. If your guessing I don't have extra legroom you're right. I also never ended up getting the dates I wanted because the representative kept getting the same error as I got initially. Fast forward to the airport. Get on the plane,  no entertainment. Pay for Wi-Fi or use their App is the entertainment. I went online, took out my gift card, and it turns out they don't accept their own gift card. Whatever, I pay. They bring the food that is included. It's not good at all. I wait for someone to come to ask if I want anything else. No one for about and hour and a half. So I press the service button on the elbow rest. No one came for another roughly 20 minutes. I get up and walk all to the back of plane and ask for Their meal combo. Turns out they don't have combos on international flight. They don't have any additional food on this flight except for chips. I buy anyway, because there's another 5 hours left and I have a gift card... but they don't accept their own gift cards for food either. So it's basically useless now with the remaining balance.... How am I going to spend 120 remaining on a gift card if I can only use it for plane tickets? I only have 6 months to use it or lose it.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Toronto to Honolulu. Do not use this airline. They cancelled me 3 times, sending me an email saying it had to do with "fraud alert" and that I had to purchase the ticket in person at an Air Canada kiosk, which is 2.5 hours from my home. I repurchased the ticket with another credit card, even though the former was fine and it should have gone through, and 3 days later it happened again. I will never fly with Air Canada rouge again.

### "penalized for choosing to pack light"
Toronto to Miami. My wife and I had 1 backpack carry amongst the two of us. We were asked to remove it from overhead storage and put it under our seats. I had shoes and towels stored in the backup making it bulky. I could not sit comfortably throughout the flight. When quizzed as to why other travellers with large and heavy carryons were given first priority - the attendant said that was just the case. It is brutal that we were penalized for choosing to pack lightly. Furthermore, we have seen multiple smaller backups and handbags stored in the same bins. I cannot say why our bag was removed. Atrocious!

### "very disappointed"
Toronto to Venice. No TV or in-seat entertainment. Poor meals for me. Clogged sink in the restroom. Small space for luggage. I was expecting more, I am very disappointed definitely will try to avoid flying with Air Canada rouge in the future.

### "No apologies, no solutions, no customer service"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Orlando. I tried to checkin today for my wife and I and found out that they had put us in separate rows even though we booked these tickets 3 months ago. I called and they wouldn’t move us even though there were two emergency seats open. This occurred after they notified us 2 months ago that our flight home was cancelled and we had to choose a different flight. No apologies, no solutions, no customer service, just the arrogance of Air Canada.

### "outstanding customer service"
Not Verified | I would like to express my gratitude for some outstanding customer service I experienced from ground crew from Las Vegas to Vancouver. I am an 80 plus-year-old lady that was not looking forward to all of the walking and stress of going through customs when we reached Vancouver. I was blown away with the attentive ground staff that whisked me through customs and made it so enjoyable and so stress-free, thank you so much for your assistance. Happy Thanksgiving to you all.

### "I expected more, and was thoroughly let down"
I will write this review as honest, and fairly as I possibly can. By far, Air Canada Rouge is the worst airline I have flown in years. Even compared to other countries ultra budget airlines, AC Rouge sets the standard for negligence and incompetence. I will elaborate, on a beautiful October day, flight from Toronto to Calgary was originally scheduled to leave at 12.30pm ET. It left well over 2.5 hours later. The first aircraft at the gate was delayed by 30 mins due to "technical issues", which turned out to be caused by the baggage compartment doors being stuck. Only after an additional 30 minutes, did they move folks over to an adjacent gate, and different aircraft. Once the people from that flight had all disembarked, including the flight crew (which took about 20 minutes), we all waited another 30 minutes in line while some of the staff were scrambling to switch folks over, and others were standing around doing nothing or talking on their cell phones. Once everyone was on board and settled in, the Captain announced over the intercom that it would be yet another 40 minutes until catering arrived and stocked the aircraft! The seats being cramped and uncomfortable is to be expected. No points there either. Absolutely asinine. For Pete's sake this is a subsidiary of Air Canada, I expected more, and was thoroughly let down. I will avoid them in the future like the plague.

### "extremely rude and cheap"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst airline out there. Terrible seat, extremely uncomfortable, rude and unfriendly staff. No snack or screen on a 4 hour flight. They charged us 35$ for checking out one bag on the way to Punta Cana and 35$ again on the way back. They lost our luggage with our home key, car key and all our medications. Nobody accepts the responsibility. They are extremely rude and cheap. The worst airline out there. Stay away! I will never travel with Air Canada again and will never recommend it to anyone.

### "a disgrace to the Canadian image"
Las Vegas to Toronto. Air Canada is pretty much a disgrace to the Canadian image and the maple leaf. It seriously needs to revamp it's customer experience/service strategy, as well as upgrade a majority of its fleet. Most of the planes, especially those serving its own country and the US are from sometime in the early 90's it seems. Squeaky seats, fraying seatbelts, broken air vents, non-functional lavatories causing huge delays, loss of baggage are just a few examples. Rude staff on the phone and on the planes is another disconcerting issue. Let's pull up our socks, Air Canada, and represent the country the way it deserves to be.

### "long wait at check-in"
Lisbon to Toronto. Awfully long wait at check-in although we were already checked in and printed our boarding pass. I recommend to go in the assistance required lineup which has double the counters. People who were behind us but did not already check in ended up well ahead of us checking in. I also would like to complain that on the overnight flight to Lisbon from Toronto the light above my seat could not be turned off (asked the flight attendant for help) and I could not sleep at all.

### "lost my sleeping bag"
Toronto to Panama City. A 5 hour flight in an aircraft designed for domestic flights. No room for the legs, no food (not even a cracker), 2 glasses of tap water, a crowded and warm plane and no entertainment system. They lost my sleeping bag and refuse to take the claim at the airport.

### "Air Canada Rouge was pretty poor"
I flew Air Canada Rouge (booked by our Travel Agent, we saw Air Canada and thought 'great' we didn’t realise that they were their budget fleet) for three flights in September 2019 from Manchester to Toronto and Calgary and then Vancouver back to Manchester. I was with my husband and his parents. All three flights were delayed leaving: First Flight: two and a quarter hours delay taking off because of a fuel light fault (this should have been sorted before we boarded and sat there all that time - preventable) Second Flight: an hour late leaving owing to a staff shortage for that flight (this should have been sorted out before we boarded - preventable) Third Flight: 15 minutes late leaving because of a late boarding passenger (not really Rouges fault). On our first flight, the delay in leaving almost caused us to miss our connection in Toronto. We managed to make it to our connecting plane Boarding Passes in hand, only to be told we had been removed (our seats undoubtedly re-sold). After much dithering, the staff managed to re assign us. However, our luggage didn’t make the flight as Rouge had decided to put it on a later flight (ours and lots of other peoples) but didn’t think to tell us, so we waited ages at the carousel the other end unnecessarily. Eventually and after much anxiety on our part it all arrived at our hotel in the middle of the night. My husband and I were in Premium Economy. The seats were extremely hard and uncomfortable. Seatbelts were short with not much room to slacken. The legroom was fine, but you couldn’t stretch out as there was a large mounting bracket beneath the seat in front. The overhead bins were minuscule. The iPads we were given to entertain us on the return flight wouldn’t connect properly, saying there was an error. We couldn’t be bothered to report it as we were so tired. It looked like everyone else’s was the same. The food was just ok and nothing special. Air stewards on all flights were friendly enough, but did seem disinterested. My in-laws were in Economy and experienced all of the above, except smaller seats and no in-flight entertainment. Unfortunately, their seats weren’t clean either, attached is a picture of the gap in my mother-in-laws footwell, it was absolutely filthy and there appeared to be months of old litter and food debris. Unfortunately, as a whole Air Canada Rouge was pretty poor and it’s highly unlikely that we will ever use them again, or recommend them to anyone.

### "truly deserve nothing"
Not Verified | Toronto to Edmonton. This is the worst airline I have ever flown, the staff were so very rude. They have you squashed in there like sardines, you cannot move, you are constantly bumping the seat in front of you, as is the person sitting behind you. The seats, if you could call them that was like sitting on concrete, you literally had to crawl over the armrest to get out of your seat as there is no leg room at all. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life. The staff were horrible and when coming around with the beverage cart, they kept skipping rows and not bothering to ask people if they wanted anything. No in-flight entertainment at all, not even a place to plug in your headphones to at the very least listen to music. This airline is a joke if you ever see Air Canada rouge come up, stay far away. I tried to opt-out of giving any star ratings at all because they truly deserve nothing, but it would not allow me to submit otherwise.

### "staff generally disinterested"
Not Verified | Manchester to Toronto. Not impressed with Air Canada rouge. Two-hour delay as problems with fuel. Booked seating going fine, returning didn’t book seats. My husband and I couldn’t sit together, although a number of people were by themselves and were sleeping using three seats. My husband asked if we could sit in empty seats which meant we could sit together and they refused. The staff on the plane were generally disinterested for the whole six-hour flight, food on the outgoing flight was not too bad, but return flight so, so.

### "I was not impressed at all"
Flight 1: I arrived early to Detroit - 3 hours early because international flight. They would not take my checked bag because I was too early. They stated that they only take check bags 1 hour prior to boarding time. This meant I was stuck sitting in the pre-security area of the airport for 2 hours. I had no access to food. Flight 2: Delayed leaving Toronto. Obtained updates via text that changed 10 times and had 3 gate changes in the airport. Flight 3: My assigned seat was given to someone else. I was told, oh there are empty seats. I found one myself. When we boarded it was raining - they closed the doors and then we were told we had to wait to take off. Waited for over 30 mins. Flight 4: No issues. Picked up bag only to find it must have sat on the tarmac in the rain at flight 3 time - everything in my bag was soaked when I got it. Flight 2 and 3 were on larger planes that appeared to be newer but no power plugs for phones or iPads. App for movie worked fine. I was not impressed at all. Will avoid flying with Air Canada rouge in the future!

### "I felt like a sardine!"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Barcelona. These planes are way too tight for long haul flights. I felt like a sardine! A friend paid extra for her seat and was very uncomfortable. The "first class" seats are a joke for all the extra room they have. Our return trip from Rome was longer but seemed shorter in a regular Air Canada plane. The seats were comfortable with more leg room and monitors on the seat backs, no extra cost paid for seats.

### "Very rude staff"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Toronto. Very rude staff. No snacks offered. Asked for water twice, half hour later no one brought it. When asked for the third time they started giving attitude like it's our fault. The plane was half full yet they lied saying it overfilled and people need to check in their carry on. Plane was delayed. The board information was not updated until the last second. Will never fly Air Canada again.

### "crew totally uninterested"
Calgary to Toronto. First time flying with Air Canada rouge and the last. The aircraft smelled like a children's daycare center, probably not cleaned for some time. The crew seemed totally uninterested and displayed an "I wish I was not here attitude". The flight was fine, left early and arrived early but no comparison with an actual Air Canada flight.

### "80 min before moving"
Toronto to Kingston. 115 pm departure time, all people on board door close. Then they started loading luggage. Finished loading 155pm. Sat on the plane for longer than 80 min before moving. Why board if luggage not loaded or not scheduled to load?

### "no free coffee or tea"
Toronto to Bucharest. Contacted Customer Care at Air Canada and have been provided with links to the policies of the company - very much useless. Paid over 2 thousand dollars for my parents for an international flight, paid about 300 dollars round trip for regular check in luggage below 23 kg. My parents got a piece of bread dipped in maple syrup, no free coffee or tea on the flight to Bucharest last night. Will think twice before booking Air Canada. I will not make that mistake again.

### "No longer a bargain flight"
Flew to Lisbon Sept 10 on AC1916, economy. Nice new plane. First drink not served until dinner 2 or 3 hours later. Staff confirmed in flight entertainment did not work on this plane. Should work on iPad or android device as there are no built in screens on Rouge. On flights to Europe they do provide a hot meal. It was very good (within north America you pay for food). The fees to pre-book seats are high, exorbitant for seats with more leg room. No longer a bargain flight. Standard seats are okay, as on air transat. Rouge MUST solve the in-flight entertainment.

### "nothing premium about this aircraft or service"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Toronto. There was nothing premium (or Rouge's version of Business Class) about this aircraft or service. First, the aircraft: a very old 767 where the overhead bins were not configured to match today's carry-on baggage. Thankfully, my carry-on was only partially filled because I had to push that down to squeeze it into the bin above my seat. The seat itself looked premium class in a 2 by 2 by 2 configuration. On take-off and landing everything rattled and shook and I was actually surprised the plane made the flight without falling to pieces. Service: only a bottle of water laid on the seat with no pre-flight drink service like other "business class" offerings from other airlines. The wine, if one wants to call it that, was barely drinkable and I chose the pasta meal choice because the curry from the butter chicken was making me nauseous and I was in row 1! The crew did the mandatory service of drinks followed by lunch then a snack before landing. However, in between all of this there was hardly any follow-up with the premium class passengers. They were more concerned with ensuring that the curtain from the cabin to the galley was shut solid with the velcro closures. Getting to Vegas I used a different airline where the service was top notch as it should for business class but the kicker: the other airline cost was about 70% less than what I paid for this dreadful flight!

### "Wouldn’t do anything to help"
Venice to Toronto. Horrible experience with this airline. Will never fly with Air Canada rouge again. We were delayed due to mechanical issues for nearly 3 hours causing us to miss our connection. Wouldn’t do anything to help and had the attitude that they got us from point A to B so who cares what time it was supposed to get in. Awful customer service. Entertainment system kept freezing up the whole flight. All in all a terrible experience.

### "disappointing customer service"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Warsaw via Toronto. Really disappointing customer service - when they ran out of hot tea in my aisle, I had to ask for it couple times and still didn’t get it. I was shocked, this attitude is something that cannot be explained. Little leg room, old aircraft, no entertainment in seats and bad experience. No snacks included on a 5,5h flight to San Francisco, meals served only on Europe to Canada flight. Tickets weren’t cheap and that’s why all those mentioned things were more than frustrating.

### "Rouge is a nightmare"
Deer Lake to Toronto. Flew to Newfoundland on Friday and flight was delayed over 2 hours due to mechanical problems. Now trying to fly back to Toronto on Monday after a great weekend only to be delayed 4 hours due to mechanical problems. I love Newfoundland (born in Ontario) but stay away from this airline - Rouge is a nightmare.

### "very helpful flight attendant"
We travelled Toronto to Varadero with Air Canada rouge in late August and very pleased: the on-time departure, flight crew service, food served / purchased, very comfortable, not as cold as we have experienced with other airlines. Karim and Cassandra were very helpful flight attendant. We will chose this airline in our future travel. Thank you.

### "I am very upset"
Fort Lauderdale to Montreal. I requested wheelchair assistance with a service dog but the gentleman did not want to push the wheelchair because I had my service dog with me. His exact words were "I don’t like dogs" even though he saw how badly I needed his help. I am very upset that this happened, the man was very rude and arrogant. Thank goodness there was another kind man nearby us who offered his assistance because my family member was carrying the bags.

### "Very cheap service"
Not Verified |  Flight 1852, August 22, Las Vegas to Toronto. Very cheap service. No coffee or tea. With the Air Canada stocks doing so well, the company should invest more in customer satisfaction. No space for luggage on plane even though it meets the requirements.

### "could not get over the filthiness"
Not Verified |  Nice to Montreal with Air Canada rouge. Flew both with this airline for my recent honeymoon in August 2019. Both flights were delayed for “technical issues”. I could not get over the filthiness of the plane. See picture attached. I wish I had also taken a picture of the tray which was covered in crumbs and smears from previous passengers.

### "premium seats very comfortable"
While the premium seats (extra legroom) in rows 13 to 15 were very comfortable, the real irritation was with the Air Canada Rouge Player. I tried to watch two movies on my return flight (to Toronto) on August 16. Both movies cut out at various places in the movie. I waited patiently for the buffering circle to take me back to the movie where it was interrupted but neither movie came on. I had to exit the Air Canada app, re-enter the App, re-enter the Rouge player, and try to fast forward to where each movie was interrupted. I gave up on the first movie, thinking there was something particularly wrong with that movie. Same thing happed with my second move. I had to exit and re-enter the player over 10 times (I stopped counting at 10). In this day and age, an airline like AC Rouge, which forces you to use an wifi player to access entertainment, you would think they could get it right and make the experience seamless, enjoyable and not irritating. This ruined my flight. Never had this problem on Westjet, which uses a similar wifi player on its app.

### "pleasantly surprised by the experience"
Not Verified |  Manchester to Toronto. Having read the reviews I was quite concerned and pleasantly surprised by the actual experience! The flight was on time, clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. Yes the seats were slimline, we had to take our own iPad and the food was basic, but for someone who mainly flies budget airlines within Europe it really wasn’t too bad at all, We were also pleasantly surprised to find a charging point to keep our iPad which we’d stocked up with Netflix to keep us going, a 23kg luggage allowance, free transit of kids car seats and pillows and blankets. I think that as long as you don’t expect the actual full Air Canada offer and are aware of the differences with Rouge, then for us at least it was a cheap and effective way to get to our destination.

### "had to pay for entertainment"
Flying with Air Canada Rouge from Athens to Toronto was my most difficult experience so far. In addition to pay extra for alcoholic drinks, ear phones, seats designated for mothers and babies, I had to pay for entertainment. The internet is very expensive and charged by hour. The flight was 11 hours. Traveling with an 18 months old baby, I was forced to purchase the WiFi service, $42.50 for the whole flight. There was no written instruction in the seat pocket so the pilot gave us instructions in the beginning. With a baby sleeping on my lap, I had to call for help. The flight attendant gave a brief instructions and left. My credit card was charged but the page crashed. I could not use the service. Again I had to asked for help, the flight attendant came and advised that she cannot troubleshoot and we have to chat with ground. My husband had to spend half an hour just to get the refund for that transaction. I was given a notice to hold my baby when the seat belt sign was on for so long during the flight and there was no turbulence. We were offered hot drinks two times during the flight and due to the turbulence we could not have them, I understand it's because of safety but they should come back after the seat belt sign is off to serve those who wish to have hot drinks. This is a service that it has been paid for. At the time of check-in we asked for a seat with bassinet. Although that there was a free one but we had to pay extra plus since the baby was older than 1 year, he could not use the bassinet due to the safety issue. So what's the use of paying extra if I cannot use the bassinet in this flight. The food was awful. There was absolutely no accommodation for the young children and babies, Unfriendly staff. I chose this flight because I had good experience with Air Canada. I did not know that Rouge is different.

### "uncomfortable, average everything"
Not Verified |  Air Canada domestic was fine, it was another average/decent flight. No bells and whistles some little monitor tv’s in the seat although mine didn’t work...nothing fancy but fine none the less. Air Canada rouge international flight was the worst flight I’ve ever been on. Small, uncomfortable, average everything. No tv monitors or entertainment. The arm rest... where your elbow will naturally place itself .. and BAM the lights are on blaring at everyone. The button placement is by far the most ill thought out tech I’ve ever seen. Completely insane that a switch that can cause such a disturbance is the easiest thing to tap with your arm. Every 5 seconds lights were blasting on and off and the chatter of angry people who accidentally rested there elbow on a arm rest and regretted it! Then they told us we can hook to the wifi but to do it quick because it only allows 110 people to connect. So finally 5 hours into the flight I connect. 7 minutes into my movie it freezes and never comes back. I reload, it plays, it stops again I’ve never in all my years of traveling, all my international flights and all my adventures been on such a silly plane. I won’t book again.

### "Not enough room for knees"
Toronto to Venice. Delayed 1 hour 40 minutes on departure due to technical difficulty. No water offered in that time. Personnel used last 3 rows of seats for themselves and didn't allow people to use them. Food was barely edible for me. Not enough room for knees for average man.

### "flight was perfectly adequate"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Manchester. Unfortunately delayed and hour but the counter staff were well informed and could update us - this due to late inbound aircraft. Rouge uses older aircraft so we did not expect all the "bells and whistles" but we could charge and use our own devices on board. Seating was fine with plenty of leg room in row 15. On board crew were good. Food was poor (we had a chicken dish) but I am not sure we expected any better, although on our daytime flight to Canada a month earlier the food was pretty much OK; but then in economy we always fly expecting poor food on whichever airline, so if it is good we have a surprise! Overall the flight was perfectly adequate. Improvements? Maybe the food. Staff uniforms need a new fashion designer; some of the female outfits were a poor fit and looked uncomfortable. On booking flights, like most budget airlines, the hidden costs need to be shown more clearly.

### "very disappointed with the service levels"
Not Verified |  My family and I flew with Air Canada Rouge from Edinburgh to Toronto then on to Havana and then back to Toronto and back to Manchester recently. I would say that, having done a lot of travelling, I was very disappointed with the service levels, the staff and the quality of experience we had. There is no inflight entertainment, which, when you are travelling on planes for 10 hours is pretty poor in this day and age. They say you can download an app to your phone and get entertainment through this. We all did this but it didn't work and you couldn't watch anything without it constantly buffering! The staff were unfriendly and unhelpful, the flight back to Manchester was one of the coldest flights I have ever experienced - maybe the pilot left the window open overnight so extremely difficult to sleep when your teeth are chattering! The price wasn't that cheap as to justify these corners being cut. Also three out of four flights delayed and two overbooked and looking for volunteers to step off flight! If you have another option I wouldn't use Air Canada - never flown with them before and thought Air Canada would be good but left extremely disappointed! Final point, the app also doesn't work for you to confirm seats and do online check-in - it takes you to a "report an error page" which then doesn't work! Sums it up for me.

### "had the most amazing flight"
Cancun to Montreal. I had the most amazing flight with Air Canada Rouge yesterday, July 31st. It was smooth and very quick to arrive. One flight attendant in particular made my trip even more special. Giulia saw that I was crying (they were tears of gratitude) and while I was in the bathroom, left me a chocolate bar at my seat with a note saying “No matter what it is, life is good. Keep on smiling”. I have never received so much sympathy from a professional in this industry before. Definitely a touching detail I will never forget that brightened up my already great experience! Thank you Air Canada and Giulia!

### "treated us exceptionally well"
Not Verified |  Flew in from Venice to Toronto on flight AC1907 on July 18th. Although we were in Economy, the staff/crew treated us exceptionally well. Courteous, pleasant and prompt service. Circulated and saw to our needs. Pleasant disposition and truly made us feel valued. Made the 9 hour flight a very positive experience. Thank you, crew of flight AC1907.

### "refuse to reimburse us"
Flight from Montreal to Marseille in June 2019 delayed 2 hrs due to mechanical difficulties. We finally take off & 3 hrs into flight we turn around & return to Montreal because of mechanical difficulties. Sleep in airport for 4 hours. Board again, and delayed for another 2 hrs. Arrive in France 13 hrs late. We were told to keep our hotel receipts so we could be reimbursed. Not only do they refuse to reimburse us, but they won’t even provide name & contact number of a person to speak to - all communications must be done electronically. We went with AC because it was more affordable & between paying for seats & hotel rooms it ended up being significantly more $$.

### "refuses to reimburse for hotel room"
Marseille to Washington via Montreal / Toronto. Flight from Montreal was delayed due to mechanical difficulties. We were forced to wait onboard for hours while they fixed the problem. We missed our connecting flight in Toronto & they had only 3 agents to help hundreds of guests that had missed their connection. We had to spend the night in Toronto & get new flight home the next morning. Air Canada refuses to reimburse for hotel room. Furthermore - there’s no phone number to call to speak to an agent - all communication must be done electronically. Instead they offered me a voucher for a future flight - I will never fly Air Canada again! !

### "Lack of in flight service"
No entertainment. The only entertainment was through a in flight online service which is accessed through your own device. The service was not working for the whole flight. With a one year old child makes a 8 hour flight difficult. Lack of in flight service. To finish it off, they damaged our bag. I tried to speak to them about it but they gave me a card to contact them on. Now back in the UKand don’t want to call at fear of further cost and their online complaint proceeded not working. So, I’m stuck, with no help.

### "premium rouge seats uncomfortable"
Have flown this route a few times in "Premium Rouge" Firstly, it has always been late. On my most recent flight Manchester to Toronto no amenity kit in Premium Rouge, iPads lent out but no headphones, not a  word from the pilots. Food basic. On the return YYZ/MAN Premium breakfast is a slice of banana bread with a drink. Same aircraft both ways and the iPads were grubby, the seat trays dirty. I find the premium rouge seats uncomfortable when compared with Air Canada premium economy. Also, if you use the Rouge iPads, entertainment is only films, no music, games or moving map. Pretty poor experience. Having used the service a few times, have decided I will no longer use Rouge for any further flights.

### "entitled to their comfort"
Zagreb to Toronto. My first and last flight on Air Canada rouge. The plane was old, dirty and in horrible shape. When I took my seat, I noticed that a piece of floor loose so I told that to the flight attendant. She laughed and took it away. While they were serving lunch I asked the attendant to ask the person in front to put their seat back upright so that I could eat. She answered "I can't do that, everyone is entitled to their comfort. I couldn't believe what she told me and was furious. I found the food  terrible. The good side was that they offered drinks and water very, very often, which was really nice.

### "an overcrowded, unorganized mess"
Started off great with Air Canada from Winnipeg to Toronto. Very accommodating and everything was on time. My connecting flight from Toronto to Deer Lake was not at all like that. It was delayed by mechanical issues which was fine, then they asked people to check their carry-ons because there was an overcrowded plane. We then boarded and had seating issues with not having enough seats for people. After all that was figured out, they “misplaced” cargo (a dog) and were still loading our original luggage two hours after our flight was supposed to leave. Should they not have seats and luggage figured out before hand? It was an overcrowded, unorganized mess and I would not recommend flying with Air Canada Rouge until they get things figured out.

### "clean and comfortable"
Manchester to Toronto. Cannot say anything negative about this flight. Travelled with trepidation after reading the reviews. The flight crew were 100 per cent attentive, kept us well hydrated. Aircraft was clean and comfortable. Seats were comfortable, food was good. Would not hesitate to fly with them again

### "Seats are small"
Calgary to Las Vegas. Seats are small. They realized 10 min before boarding that their flight was oversold and were trying to move passengers to next flight and in this commotion they delayed the boarding and then because of bad weather we got stuck for another hour. Even after weather cleared they were the last airline to realize time to load bags? Honestly pay the difference and take a better flight.

### "no onboard entertainment"
Manchester to Toronto. I have never before come across a trans Atlantic flight with no onboard entertainment. No wonder what with the plane being so old. No-one seemed to be bothered that the flight was 2 hours late and that many passengers were going to miss their connections. A simple apology would have sufficed. Never again will I fly Air Canada.

### "Love Air Canada Rouge"
❎ Not Verified | Love Air Canada Rouge. Flew home (Toronto) from Barbados last Tuesday (July 2nd) and our flight attendant was amazing! I’m really scared to fly and she went out of her way to make me feel comfortable the whole flight! I have never felt more safe and relaxed on a flight. She also had a smile on her face with every passenger she was talking to. Great flight! And I hate flying! !

### "a somewhat disjointed meal service"
Toronto (YYZ) / Edinburgh (EDI) in premium rouge. Part of an AC booking EDI-YYZ-YLW / YVR-YWG-YYZ-EDI. This is the 6th season of AC rouge and I have used them in premium rouge regularly since they started operations. Premium rouge (Premium Economy PY) on an AC Rouge transatlantic (TA) flight, means that only the flight crew are sitting in front of you! There is no Business Class. Pre-boarding was fine, clear announcements being made with regard to boarding by zone number. On board at each seat (armrest) a bottle of water and a menu was waiting. Unfortunately, while waiting for departure from the gate a couple of FAs could be seen eating their own food in the galley area – divider curtains wide open. This did not look good, and I am sure that this should not happen. The in-flight entertainment devices were handed out and food orders were taken prior to the actual departure. After departure a drinks and nibbles service commenced, dinner should have followed on, however on this flight it didn’t! - What happened next was that economy plastic cutlery was handed out. On enquiring, it appeared that although the food had been loaded on board at YYZ, no cutlery and linen napkins had been. This resulted in a somewhat disjointed meal service. I have formally complained about this to AC Customer service in YYC. Within 24 hours a positive reply offering a discount on a future AC related booking was offered. Obviously, the catering issue had been reported to those who should know about these things! – Very impressed! Dinner was cleared away 2 hours plus after the actual time in the air. This allowed for 2.5 hours of ‘rest’ before the lights came on again and a light breakfast (banana bread) was offered to those who wanted it. Landing at EDI was on time and the aircraft parked up at a gate with an air-bridge. (on the outbound EDI / YYZ steps were provided) To conclude this was not the best experience I have had with AC rouge. The outbound EDI / YYZ, (apart from the steps issue) and a domestic sector YYZ / YLW taken were much better. The premium rouge product on a short TA flight is a good compromise between economy and business class. Next one is in September 2019 over the same EDI / YYZ!

### "stewards were 100% professional"
Montreal to Pointe a Pitre. Great flight. Had a disruptive passenger who created a scene over his carry on bag. The stewards were 100% professional in dealing with him and too be honest they were too nice. The return was just as good. A big thank you to air steward Codey

### "Food was really good"
Detroit to Berlin via Toronto. This review is based on having Premium Economy on an Air Canada Rouge transatlantic flight. In other words, it's the best seat you can get with them since they don't have a traditional business class. In the continental U.S., I usually fly first class (for work). This flight was for work but first class/business class is ridiculous for transatlantic flights so I fly Premium Economy which is actually quite nice. Let me first say that if I did not have Premium Economy this would have been the worst flight ever. If you are from the U.S., then Air Canada Rouge is equivalent to Spirit Airlines when it comes to their Economy Class. They also have an "Economy Plus" which is a little better (i.e. normal airplane seats). PROS + Food: it was really good. Equivalent to first class in the U.S. + Recline/Leg Room: Comfortable recline and leg room. Even had a little stool for your feet + Staff: I'm not going to lie, the Air Canada Rouge pilots and flight attendants are some of the best I've encountered CONS - Seat Cushion: Worst ever. It's paper thin. Couldn't sleep at all on my 8hr flight. - Plane Age: The 767-300 is/was a workhorse. It's ageing and not ageing well. Overall I felt safe. But in 5yrs, not so much. No Wifi: This killed me. I count on Wifi to do work. Nothing. - Air Canada Booking: I had no clue I was booking an Air Canada Rouge flight until after I booked. Sneaky.

### "was not comfortable"
Toronto to Calgary. This was a new aeroplane. I don't know the type. I have short legs and my knees were up against the seat ahead of me. When the guy in the seat ahead of me change position it would press against my knees and was not comfortable. I hate to think about how it feels for taller people with longer legs. But mostly what I disliked was that there was no way to charge my smartphone so I could use it to watch the online entertainment. This new plane has no outlets for its passengers. Bad and unpopular idea! I ran out of charge halfway through the movie. Several other people including the ones in my row and those across were unhappy with this too. No one could watch the entertainment in my row. I don't understand the reasoning behind this. The price isn't even cheaper than regular or Westjet or Air Canada which I prefer. I will not fly Rouge again. You get a worse flight for the same price. I didn't realize this was Rouge until I was at the airport.

### "summarize flight as below average"
My flight from Dublin to Vancouver was what I would describe as ordinary. The cabin crew were sort of aloof and doing an average job. My main complaint was that the washrooms in the middle part of the aircraft ran out of toilet paper and there was no effort to replace. The replacement were the small napkins that are usually used when serving drinks. There was a small snack provided before landing which was already past the best before date by two months. I would summarize the flight as below average.

### "service from staff exceptional"
Barcelona to Toronto. I was so worried to fly with Air Canada Rouge because of negative reviews. With this 9 hour flight I only have two negative things to say. Flight boarding was 1 hour delayed with ground staff no mentioning anything. The inflight entertainment system kept freezing or going blank. You would have to close app and re opening it, and skip movie/tv show up scene you were at once it dropped out. Other than that service from cabin staff was exceptional, seating and leg room was comfortable and plenty. I go as far as saying this was the flight I feared most but ended up being more enjoyable and satisfied than the Air Canada flight I had flying to Europe. That AC flight was cramped, tight and not enjoyable experience .

### "Why are we being penalized"
Orlando to Toronto. Checked our bags for USD $23, get on the plane carrying a nap sack. I need to put my bags under the seat in front of me to make room for the people with their big carry ons. Are you kidding me. Put some controls in place in terms of number of carryons and size of bags. Why are we being penalized? No room for our feet others with the big bags have lots of room.

### "have the least legroom"
Toronto to Miami. Air Canada Rouge seats have the least legroom I have experienced. Flight attendant in my section had a really bad attitude. Very unpleasant flight.

### "still haven't been refunded"
Myself and 2 coworkers had to pay twice for a flight to Orlando and still havent received any compensation for tickets or the expenses of the delay. They lost our luggage for 3 days and refuse to cover any expenses from this.I was flying from Vancouver to Toronto for business and our connecting flight to Orlando in Toronto was delayed (not Air Canada's fault, but an airport issue). For almost 4 hours in the airport, Air Canada employees at the airport and via phone refused to speak to anyone on the delayed flights about what they should do. We finally re-booked our flights for early the next morning and booked a hotel for the evening. When we woke up, Air Canada at around 1:00 AM rebooked our original flight to 6:00am - of course we didnt see this email so late at night so we foregoed that flight and went with the 8:30 we had already rebooked. Of course, we tried calling Air Canada to inform them of the switch but still no one was answering their phones. Our 8:30 was rescheduled to 12:00 and when we were able to leave, we asked our flight check-in attendant to scan our bag ticket to make sure our bags were on the correct plane, she assured us they most definitely were. No luggage once we arrive in Orlando. It took us three days to finally receive our luggage, all the while being treated incredibly poorly by rude and incompetent employees who took no responsibility for the inconvenience. We still haven't been refunded for anything, and all staff we deal with says there is nothing they can do.

### "No inflight entertainment"
Barcelona to Toronto. This was the most uncomfortable plane with the worst service and horrible food. No inflight entertainment screen provided. The flight attendants seemed irritated. Get it together, Air Canada. Step up the game a bit. At least clean the plane better between flights.

### "leave our luggage behind"
Grenada to Toronto. Upon boarding at Grenada they announced on the plane that there was a weight issue and they were "reloading the luggage for proper weight distribution". Upon arriving in Toronto we found out that meant they decided to leave our luggage behind and not tell us. Still no word on where our valuables are or when they will be returning. I understand that the plane needs to be in line with weight restrictions but inform your guests, offer the cost of the flight back or at least a discount. The worst part is that they have failed to guarantee its return. At this point it may as well be lost luggage. In this case those pieces of luggage that are now unattended in grenada should be of the highest priority to return home, yet all agents we talk to seem incredibly unphased by this. Also after waiting at the carousel for an hour and finally going to customer service they nonchalantly told us it was left behind. No apology was given. Also the aircraft is dated. No entertainment, tighter seating than any i have experienced before. Staff were rude and snappy.I will never fly air canada rouge or air canada in general again and will make sure to tell everyone i know about this experience. Instead of coming home relaxed and happy we have had to spend hours of every day back since waiting for updates.

### "poor choice of food"
Mexico City to Toronto. I like travelling with Air Canada, but rouge is a stain to their name. No inflight screens on board, even for long flights, poor choice of food, Bad seating. I paid for a meal in my return flight that they didn’t even have on board. Only snacks. A 90 mins delay in flight, missed the connection. They couldn’t give me a flight until 9 hours later.

### "supposed you are together"
Toronto to Punta Cana. Very dissapointed, I got an Air Canada vacation package and flights were with Air Canada Rouge. The surprise when we did the check in the designated 2 separate seats and far each other and we were not the only with that problem. Also people with no seat because overbooking. If you buy a package it supposed you are together.

### "Super nice gate agent"
Toronto to Moncton. Me and my girlfriend are larger and this airline was very accommodating. There was an empty row of seats at the back of the plane and they switched us there at the last minute so we weren't squished beside someone. We had premium seats, and they even said our seat fee will be refunded by calling the airline. It was cramped in the back but we had an extra seat so not bad. Very accommodating. Super nice gate agent and flight attendants.

### "The crew was wonderful"
Not Verified |  The crew was wonderful. The pilots were great. The seats were thin, small and cramped. They barely reclined. This was a long flight in extremely uncomfortable seats. The food was gross, I had the gluten free option. The flight back from Athens the wifi did not work so we had no movies to watch.

### "simply greedy and pathetic"
Montreal to Providenciales. Expected a lot more from Air Canada. Rouge aircraft is simply an assault on a person's personal space. I am 5'11" and I cannot sit in the seat unless my legs are wide open. Cramped and appallingly is how I would rate this seating configuration. This is the last time I travel with this carrier. Even if it is more expensive I will travel on another airline just to have the decency of legroom. Pathetic Air Canada, simply greedy and pathetic.

### "was really good"
Fort Lauderdale to Victoria via Toronto. This is my 2nd time flying Rouge Premium and it was really good. Seats are super comfortable, wide with lots of leg room. The use of iPads for IFE is good, however, if they are not updated, then you can't watch some of the content. Also, the "holder" for the iPads aren't as secure as one would hope. Food on the flight was really good (ordered the Asian vegetarian) and I was very full at the end of the flight. Overall, worth the money!

### "how wonderful the staff was"
Not Verified |  This was the first flight I ever took, my husband and I were celebrated on 34th wedding anniversary so we decided to go to Nassau. We flew out of Toronto I cannot believe how wonderful the staff was on the airplane when they found out it was our 34th wedding anniversary. They wrote a note on a tray with a small wine bottle some chocolates some plastic glasses with her too drawn on them and a heart pin and presented it to us and wished us a happy anniversary it brought tears to my eyes! The attendants on this flight went over and above for us and we were overjoyed! I would love to thank the crew for making wonderful memories that will last the rest of our lives.

### "aircraft  old and uncomfortable"
Lisbon to Tampa via Toronto. Never again. Air Canada Rouge is possibly the worst airline I have every flown. I checked my bag in Lisbon to be told there was a fee which I paid. I asked if my bag could be checked to Tampa - no. I had to pick up my bag in Toronto and recheck it for my flight to Tampa. I had to pay a 2nd baggage fee. My bag cost $120 dollars to fly on the same booking. The aircraft was very old and uncomfortable, very dirty, with no in-flight entertainment. You have to download their app which didn't work. They had devices to rent but ran out about the 3rd row from the top. Food was disgusting and I found the cabin crew to be unhelpful, rude and very badly mannered. Fly with any other airline if you have a choice.

### "space and service are awful"
Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. Rouge flights in economy - seats, space and service are awful! On April 7, I was rescheduled from a super 8 aircraft and was put on a rouge flight. So cramped that, at barely five feet tall, my knees touched the seat ahead - no room to put a small bag under the seat. The staff were rude when I asked for help to put my bag in the bin above. Today I am travelling again. I had no choice with the airline, but used points for an upgrade. This time in rouge business- I expect the same lousy seats and service. Air Canada prmised lower priced service with rouge - reduced costs considerably but never adjusted the price. It is as costly as a regular Air Canada flight.

### "delayed almost an hour"
Toronto to Barcelona. The flight was delayed out of Toronto for almost an hour. I almost miss my bus from Barcelona to Andorra because of the delay. I will stay away from Air Canada flights as there is no value for the money.

### "I would recommend"
Toronto to Mexico City. The service is alright. Nothing special. The flight left about 20 minutes late but pleasant overall. The crew were friendly, I would recommend this flight.

### "most annoying flight"
Toronto to Las Vegas. The flight crew was a little cranky always complaining that she didn't had enough sleep before the flight. Inflight service was terrible. This flight was the most annoying flight I had so far.

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience. They over booked the flight from Montreal to Punta Cana. My wife couldn't even get confirmed until last minute. Even though we booked our trip 2 months before. Never got to sit with her. Entertainment never worked. Ran out of food for passengers. Food was bad. Some staff were nice, but most were rude. Never fly with Air Canada rouge again. Would rate zero out of 10 but have to give a 1 minimum.

### "went over and above"
We were due to fly from Edmonton to Las Vegas and our flight was cancelled due to bad weather in Vegas. The airline was very nice to put us up in a hotel in Edmonton for the night, give us $20 of food passes for the airport and $40 food passes for the hotel for supper. It was not their fault that the weather in Las Vegas was poor so we appreciated what they did for us even though we felt they did not have to! We also received a $200 credit each so a total of $400 towards our next flights booked with them! How amazing we were very shocked to receive the email while in Vegas about the credit. I don’t normally have time to write reviews but I had to for this and feel Air Canada went out of their way to make us feel a little less sad that we had to stay one day of our vacation in Edmonton rather than Vegas! Thank your Air Canada you really went over and above!

### "only allow the small carry on free"
Not Verified |  Montego Bay to Toronto. My husband and I have decided not to fly with Air Canada anymore. Hour and half late departing Montego bay Jamaica no snacks just a beverage for a 4 hour flight which turned into a six and a half hours flight. We sat on the tarmac for an hour and a half waiting to unboard the flight. With little or no updates until people were showing signs of frustration no offer of a complimentary drink or snack. When we landed we were told we would be off in 10 to 15mins which was a lie, it was an hour and a half later. With the seat belts sign on we were not allow to use the washroom for over an hour. No consideration towards their customers they seems to be taking away more every time we fly. They only allow the small carry on for free. Every check bag you have to pay for..

### "Do not get economy plus"
St. Lucia to Toronto. I’m unimpressed and disappointed. I wanted comfort on my way home and I wasn’t given it. I didn’t get the preferred seating (I get it, it’s not guaranteed) however, to be told I need to pay for my food by the flight attendant when I payed for it previously. My flight was delayed and I didn’t buy food in the airport because I was expecting to be fed. I have contacted the company and “in goodwill” they will only give me a 20% off my next flight. Which is insulting because I will never fly with them. They won’t do anything for me and “will continue to work hard on improving their customer service. I was ripped off and lied to. Do not fly with them. Do not get economy plus. There are way better air lines out there.

### "service is non existent"
Toronto to Orlando. The plane was filthy. Delays with retrieving a baggage from under a plane for a passenger who did not make the flight along with the plane loosing power (no lights or air) on the taxi way caused a 3 hour delay before take off. After landing in Orlando 3.5 hours late, the door to the baggage compartment was "frozen shut" resulting in a 4 hour delay at baggage claim. Absolutely no communication from Air Canada once on the ground. We landed at 2:50am and luggage did not arrive until 6:45am. I wrote a complaint and was told I will be contact within 52 business days. Customer service is non existent.

### "Zero leg space"
Toronto to Orlando. Zero leg space, I'm not a large individual, 5ft 8in tall and 120lbs and it was not a comfortable ride. Staff wasnt very kind when I ordered soup and then the tray on the seat back in front of me collapsed and became unusable for holding hot soup. I also had a drink on the tray, so I cannot hold 2 liquids and eat at the same time. No signage for the toilets, and armrests had buttons on them, cant rest your elbow without accidentally calling the flight attendants. Would never fly this airline again.

### "Terrible experience"
Las Vegas to Thunder bay via Toronto. Terrible experience with Air Canada. Flights delayed or cancelled. I arrived in Vegas 24h later and left 24h + hours late. They refused to pay for a hotel. Told me to lay down on the floor. My luggage was lost, bad/no customer service, spent 3 hours in the plane after landing, etc. $500 later on extra money due the the inconvenience, I am hoping to hop on the next flight with the 2 previous ones being cancelled (not all weather related). When the first flight was cancelled on Feb 8, other airlines were departing, including Westjet and Porter. The whole thing was traumatizing enough overall that I am going to avoid flying for as long as I can.

### "So incredibly rude"
Orlando to Toronto with Air Canada rouge. Terrible flight attendants. We are very easy going passengers and I didn't notice how indifferent the attendants were until I started choking. I pressed the call button and waited. My husband turned back and could see the 2 stewards sitting and chatting to each other. He cleared the call button and rang it a second time, to which they continued to ignore. There was a long line up for the washroom and being that my husband is a big guy, heading to the back himself was not exactly an option. A few minutes later, a stewardess came down the aisle and had to be stopped by my husband to request a drink for me. Her annoyance at this was ridiculously obvious. Once she brought it, she passed it to him and offered no reply at all to his thank you. She couldn't even grace us with eye contact. So incredibly rude. We definitely will do our best to avoid using Air Canada in the future.

### "Uncomfortable seats, extremely cramped"
Old, tired plane. Out of 3 washrooms, 1 washroom not working, one washroom had no water for sink. Long line up for washrooms throughout the flight, difficult for anyone to use the isle. Uncomfortable seats, extremely cramped, to the point that with the seat in front slightly inclined one does not have room to open up a laptop. Flight was full so carry-on luggage was scattered everywhere on board - in the case of an emergency no one would ever get out in any kind of reasonable time. Not that clear from the Air Canada website how entertainment system would work - has changed (for the worse) from last Rouge flight (2 years ago). On the plus side, the fight left on time and the landing was very smooth. I would not recommend Rouge for any flight over 2 hours, it is just too uncomfortable.

### "it’s been over 2.5 hours"
Air Canada rouge from Toronto to Jamaica. Just a horrible experience. Over 2.5 hour delay onboard with a toddler. The flight crew keep lying saying it will be a few minutes but it’s been over 2.5 hours. I will never fly Air Canada ever again. The seating hasn’t been cleaned for a very long time and there is dry old food on the seating tray. Maybe clean the plane once in a while.

### "never had service as bad"
Las Vegas to Montreal via Toronto. I have upgraded to business class on every flight I have taken on many different airlines and never had service as bad as we had on this flight. We upgraded 24 hours before, as I always do, and once in the plane, all they gave us was a bag of peanuts telling us that we cannot get food since we upgraded at the airport and it's too last minute to provide food (which was wrong). I know the upgrade details mentioned that we might not get the business class meal for free, but why were we not offered it for purchase, as we saw people in coach purchasing that same meal (which was for purchase on their inflight menu). Once we asked, the hostess became very rude and told us well have more drinks! Besides, the seats were way less comfortable than any other airline, especially Air Canada. So be careful when purchasing your tickets if you care at all about comfort because you will not get it, no matter how much you pay on Rouge.

### "extremely uncomfortable"
Lima to Montreal. It is immoral of Air Canada to use this such an airplane for a long night flight over 8 hours. We were extremely uncomfortable, there was no entertainment and little service. The staff tells you to download the Air Canada Rouge application once on the plane when, if you are not from the country, likely you have no connection to download anything.

### "What a bad company"
Montreal to Phoenix. Again a very disappointing experience with Air Canada rouge. They lost my luggage when I arrived in Phoenix and I didn't really get any help as the person there seemed pretty clueless. Anyway, I filled out a form and left for my hotel. After 2 days of arrival and still no luggage I had to call many times their terrible customer service. Their English accent is so bad it's hard to understand. So after 4 calls and 3 days I finally got a confirmation that the delivery was initiated. And then they added icing to the cake by waking me up at 3am for delivery of my luggage. No after service calls. No offer of compensation (I did have to buy some clothes and missed 2 bike rides as I had no bike). I long for the day that a serious airline will decide to properly service my area in Canada. What a bad company. And I haven't even started to talk about the bad flights.

### "no other form of inflight entertainment"
Not Verified |  The internet didn’t work on an 8 hour flight and there was no other form of inflight entertainment. There was one plug that you had to share with your neighbour which is a little difficult if they expect you to use your own device for entertainment. Also the food was not very good, breakfast was over salted scrambled egg with bits of a cut up hotdog. We also didn’t get fed until the last half hour of our flight. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Seats were comfortable.

### "stop serving during turbulence"
Toronto to San Jose Cabo. The crew team did not look professional, not friendly and not enough attention. Very strange policy with stop serving coffee during turbulence. Meaning that it was not safe to serve hot beverages but what about people which already got coffee a minute ago? We fly very often and never saw this practice. Washroom is not well maintained.

### "disappointed & frustrated"
I flew on Air Canada from Calgary to Las Vegas last December 28, 2018. I checked-in one luggage and had no carry on with me since it was a direct flight I didn't feel the need to bring a carry-on bag since all my things could fit in my checked-in luggage. I paid the baggage fee and checked-in earlier to make sure that I won't miss my flight. As soon as I passed through security I found out that my flight was delayed so I had no choice but to wait for another hour. That was tolerable and for whatever reason Air Canada would have I felt that I didn't need to make a big deal out of it. The worst part of my Air Canada experience was that upon Arrival in Las Vegas, I found out that my bag never made it to Las Vegas. I immediately went to the baggage claim office to file a report and they said that I would have to contact Air Canada so that they could trace my bag and send it to me. How the hell do you lose a luggage on a direct flight? Could you imagine how frustrating it was to be in a place where you literally had no clothes or any of your belongings with you for a 7 day trip? I have planned this vacation a long time ago and it was my only vacation for the year 2018. I have prepared a lot for this trip thinking that I would finally be able to relax and get my much needed rest. But I was wrong, Air Canada ruined my vacation because I mostly spent my time making a lot of phone calls, sending emails during the trip and what's worst is that I was only compensated for $200 which doesn't even compare or amount to the stress, hassle and huge inconvenience that they have caused me. They never really followed up anything with me during my whole vacation in Las Vegas. My luggage never arrived in Las Vegas. I had to literally buy everything in Vegas from underwear to toiletries. I had to always made time to just call them to check whether they have found my luggage. I never got the chance to give the presents that I have packed for my friends in Vegas. It was such a terrible and frustrating experience. As a frequent passenger of Air Canada I felt that this made me realize what kind of customer service Air Canada delivers in situations like this. Trust me, in case this happens to any of you, you can be assured that you will be getting the worst customer service. I never enjoyed my only vacation in Vegas in 2018 just because Air Canada failed to do their job and reassuring me that my luggage was safe and secured with them. If I never suggested the idea of calling the Calgary Airport to check whether my luggage is still there then I probably still don't have my luggage until now. There was no initiative on their part and their plan of action in reassuring their passengers that they will be able to track their luggage is very poor. It's sad to say that as I type this horrible experience from Air Canada, the $200 hasn't been paid. God knows when they will actually reply and take action on this. It's not even the money that I'm complaining about but its more on the amount of time that I wasted just to check the status of my luggage every now & then, the huge amount of stress thinking if I will ever find my luggage and my vacation plans were absolutely ruined just because everything that I needed for my trip was not with me all because of Air Canada's fault. How can you compensate all that? It's not like you can redo my vacation in Vegas all over again. The damage is done. I am so disappointed & frustrated with my experience with Air Canada. Never again.

### "plane was especially dirty"
Flight was an average Air Canada Rouge Flight. Seat was cramped and it was hard to move around. The staff however were very hard working and very lovely, showed they wanted to be there. The plane was especially dirty which is sad considering it is one of ACRs newer 767s. The big downside came after the flight with baggage. We have priority baggage handling and our bags came out after regulars. My bag, because it was under 25k, had its priority tag ripped off. This isn’t the first time this has happened, as I did publish this on an earlier review. This is a problem that needs to be addressed as their altitude program is really becoming questionable.

### "Terrible experience"
Manchester to Toronto via Moncton. Terrible experience from start to finish. Budget airline now nothing like the airline we travelled with years ago so dont be fooled into thinking it is an upgrade airline, I would compare it to as poor Ryanair. 3 out of 4 flights were delayed, no meals given, no apologies, no compensation whatsoever. Baggage did not arrive on our onward flight. What more can I say only I will never fly with Air Canada rouge again. They offered us discounted flights for this year, but who would want to go through that experience again, we are pensioners for goodness sake.

### "no better than economy"
Toronto to Miami. You pay with points or cash for business class but it’s no better than economy on most other airlines. Air Canada should be ashamed. Unless I cannot use another airline I’ll avoid Rouge, even if I have to pay more. No room in overhead bins. Can barely fit anything under seat either!

### "pleased with my recent travels"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Punta Cana. Was very pleased with my recent travels on flight 1712/1713 the meals were beyond expectations for an airline would recommend flying with them in the future

### "waived the $100 for us"
Toronto to Miami. When returning to Miami, my niece and I removed out winter coats and placed them inside our luggage (1 piece) prior to checking in. The lady at the booth did not tell us that the piece was overweight and went ahead and registered the piece onto the carrousel. We were directed to a different booth since we had cash for payment. This 2nd lady (the cashier) told us we needed to pay $100 on top of the regular $40. This was a huge problem because we were taken by surprise and because we did not have any extra $$. The 1st lady was a new employee and she had made a few mistakes that morning (so we were told after the fact). The agent however, managed to review our situation with the Manager and waived the $100 for us. Thank you Gina. God bless you!

### "no backup systems in place"
Vancouver to St. Lucia via Toronto. Well the flight from Vancouver to Toronto was alright in that it was only 30 minutes delayed. Bad enough that you have to pay for food now but $9 for a wrap that was inedible? And now after two hours on a plane destined for St. Lucia that had issue after issue we have now been de-planed for three more hours. I sincerely doubt we’ll be going anywhere today and my vacation will be be ruined. Poorly maintained planes with no backup systems in place.

### "checked luggage did not make it"
I flew from Montreal to Phoenix via Toronto. Toronto to Phoenix there was no room for cabin luggage that were sent to luggage bay. And my checked luggage did not make it to Phoenix. The Air Canada employees in Phoenix were very reassuring. It was Monday 11:30pm and they told me that the luggage was still in Toronto and will be delivered at home tomorrow morning. On Tuesday morning, no bag was delivered and I phone to customer service : they told me the luggage was not located. On Wednesday, 48h after the lost of my luggage, I phone back to customer service and the status of luggage was still "lost". I took the name and number of the employee and asked to speak to his supervisor. The supervisor called me back 5 minutes later to tell me that the baggage was found in the meantime. I spent 500USD that day to replace some sporting goods in the luggage, but the supervisor gave me only 200USD of compensation given that the bag will be delivered on flight AC1837 the next day. The delivery at home could take 24h, so I said I will come to the airport. At 12pm, the status of my luggage on "world tracker" website was still indicating that the bag was on flight 1837 that left Toronto at 8am. I came to the airport and surprisingly the bag was not there. An employee  told me that the status of the bag changed 15 minutes after landing of flight 1837 : the status is now that the bag will arrive at midnight, via flight 1835. Never trust world tracker website : even if the bag is not on the plane, the status indicates the opposite even after landing of the plane 4 hours late ! The incompetence of the employees makes this website useless. I asked explanation to the employee and he showed me on his computer that my bag was a rush bag. Why Air Canada did not tag my delayed bag as urgent (72h delay at this time) as they are supposed to do with delayed bag? I finally got my luggage on Friday at 1am after coming 12h later at the airport. On the way back there was no room for my cabin luggage, and it was sent to luggage bay. But they put the wrong name on the luggage tag and I had to quickly ask to put the right tag on my luggage unless it would be lost somewhere.

### "the internet didn’t work"
Athens to Toronto. Had an 11 hour flight on a plane without any TVs. This mattered because the internet didn’t work. Attendant told us the internet only supported 180 people and there were 289 on board. Didn’t see anyone with use of the internet. Major airlines on international flights provide beer and wine to economy-they do not. Attendants were terrible, picked up trash about every 4 hours and would not take it when requested - said they would be back to collect trash at a different time. Since there was no flight tracker on board it would have been nice to have a few updates from the pilots-not one until descending, 10 hours later! Food is not a priority, but it was horrible also! Everything about it was bad except that I arrived safely. Advise to avoid this airline for international travel.

### "Not much leg space"
Toronto to Porto with Air Canada rouge. Older plane, delayed by 2 hours due to technical problem. Not much leg space, even for those seats for extra $100. For in-flight entertainment you need to download an app prior to boarding, it didn’t work for us. One AC outlet for 2 seats. I found flight attendants rude, no tea/coffee. One piece of luggage delayed for 24 hours.

### "they do nothing to compensate"
Not Verified |  Flew Punta Cana to Toronto. Complete trash airline. Mechanical delays are frequent and they do nothing to compensate except give a useless discount on your next flight which none of us will ever use because we will never book with Air Canada rouge again. Flight to vacation delayed 6 hours flight coming home delayed 6 hours now stuck at the resort with no room or accommodations and they do nothing.

### "Poor compared to regular Air Canada"
Lisbon to Toronto. Not much leg space, had to purchase better seats for extra $100 per seat per leg of travel. For in-flight entertainment you need to download an app prior to boarding. We did but it still didn’t work. No charging plugs if the seat is in the 1st row of economy cabin. Flight attendants friendly. Ordered special low sodium meals and got a wrap loaded with salt. Poor experience compared to regular Air Canada.

### "this is just miserable"
Toronto to Phoenix. Well the plane is quite clean but the seats are small, so small. Why didn't I know about this? I've only been sitting in it for 1 hour and I'm so uncomfortable. We haven't even taken off yet. Oh for a drink to take the edge off but we haven't even left yet because staff loading the luggage can't shut the doors. Oh for some entertainment to distract me from this torture but no there is nothing. Seriously I'm so disappointed with myself for being on this flight. I've done budget airlines before easyJet, Ryanair. Maybe I'm too old now but this is just miserable. I've always been a big supporter of Air Canada, I had no idea this service was so vastly inferior. Boo AC. And never ever again. Except my return journey of course.

### "crew provided good service"
Vancouver to Osaka. We found this flight comfortable and the crew provided good service. It seems that many people are aggravated by the lack of screens on the back of seats, to provide distraction in flight. We never pay attention to those anyhow, except to track the plane's location. The food was good. The seats were good because recline was quite limited and so the people in front of us did not push back into our space. We got two meals which were palatable. Seating is 2xx2 so we did not have to climb over anyone to get to the aisle. I'd be happy to travel on this aircraft with this airline again.

### "airline charges for checked baggage"
Toronto to Mexico City. I paid for extra leg room as I am tall (6'5") and on the return trip from Mexico the trip was abominable. I had to either spread my legs out, or cross them in forming an X. In addition, because the airline charges for checked baggage, there was no room for my backpack except under my seat, which limited the available leg room even more. Three days after the experience, I still have back pain and leg cramps. In addition, the app for inflight service demanded to be updated, and the wifi provided by the place did not allow for the update except by paying wifi fees. I will never fly with Air Canada Rouge again.

### "had to download an app"
Our trip started in Atlanta to Toronto. This was a 2.5 hour trip. Our flight was not bad, but during the flight all we got was a cup of coke to drink and no snack. Our 2nd flight was Toronto to Athens, a 9 hour fight. Seating is what it is in this day an time, but most airlines have small TV's in front of you to see a movie or to see the flight. We did not know that we had to download an app on our phones to see a movie and when we did, the movies were so old, we did not bother with them. As meals go, we had a small meal which was chicken, a cold piece of bread, some kind of salad and a small cake. As I said this is a 9 hour flight, so we get breakfast if you want to call it that. All we got was a piece of sweet bread and coffee. The staff were friendly and helpful nothing bad there.

### "We enjoyed our flight"
Toronto to Athens. We enjoyed our flight. The seating was narrow and had little adjustment. We had two meals and a snack all of which was enough for the flight. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We did not miss the entertainment as we read and napped. We would use this carrier again.

### "seats are narrow and short"
Nice to Montreal. We had an overseas flight which was over 8 hours. First, the seats are narrow and short with very little leg room. There was no entertainment system at all. We were only served a hot beverage once the whole flight. We had a little turbulence, but the flight was over 8 hours! I would not book with this airline again.

### "sold as Air Canada flights"
Calgary to Las Vegas. The most uncomfortable flying experience available with flights that did not leave on time and oblivious staff. It’s underhanded that these flights are sold as Air Canada flights and yet offer a completely inferior level of service. Shouldn’t be allowed to market them this way. If it’s a different airline and essentially a different service,sell it that way.

### "the blanket was dirty"
Barcelona to Toronto. Our flight with Rouge sucked. The cabin was chilly so I decided to use the blanket given me. When I opened the plastic bag the blanket was dirty. I showed it to my husband too and we politely asked the attendant if we can have another one. She said sorry and took the blanket when we showed her the smudges. Fifteen minutes later, heard nothing from her and so I asked another attendant. She was also being asked by the lady seated in front of me for a blanket I believe. She simply said to me with a straight face “sorry no extras. I don’t know what happened to your blanket or where it went but no extras”. I told her the same thing I told the other attendant and she said something like nothing she can do because a they are not in charge of the laundry for those stuff and that no extra blanket dismissively and left. What a customer service. The flight was 9 hrs. I left the window shade open to let the sunshine in for a bit of warmth. We got home safely but with colds.

### "an all-around cheap experience"
Beware! Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge are not the same airline! There is a serious difference in quality/experience between these two. Air Canada Rouge provided us with smaller seats, no inflight entertainment, one meal for a nine hour flight, and an all-around cheap experience. The inflight entertainment did not work for either of my devices, my father's device, both individuals sitting behind us or the individual sitting in front of us. We were advised that the system "just doesn't work" for some "older" phones (I got my phone last November). Of course, the $10 iPad rental worked well, but there are a limited number of these. We were I believe 12 rows from the front and I got the last available iPad rental (they came through the front first, so if you were at the back you were out of luck). The food was terrible, even as plane food comes. The only saving aspect was the kind flight attendants, but it really wasn't worth the price. Stay away from Air Canada Rouge and don't fall for their marketing campaigns, trying to claim this to be the same experience at a better price. It is most certainly not!

### "Seats are old and uncomfortable"
Barcelona to Montreal. Worst international flying experience! Seats are old and uncomfortable and jammed very close together. No TV screens or entertainment at all for an 9 hour flight. I later heard they had iPads for rent to watch a movie but we were not informed by the staff. We were unfortunate to get seats in the very last row facing the toilets which added an insult to an injury. Strong smell of urine through the flight, non-reclinable seat back, last in line to be served for anything. By our row no choice of food was left and what was offered contained nothing but load of cheap carbs - potato salad, pasta with nothing in it and bread so hard it felt like days old. The flight we booked was supposed to be with different airline but they flipped the airline on us for unknown reason. Feel cheated and very disappointed. The only good thing to say is about ground service. With extremely tight connection interval our bags made it to the second leg of the flight.

### "excellent value for money"
Barcelona to Lima via Toronto. Excellent performance overall. This is a low-cost leisure carrier, not Singapore Airlines, so set your expectations accordingly. My partner and I both thought that for the price paid (750 euros each for two round-trip long-haul flights, Barcelona-Toronto and Toronto-Lima, with a 5 day stopover in Toronto), Rouge provided excellent value for money. The planes are old but well maintained and clean (including toilets). The staff were pleasant throughout. The seats are fine, with adjustable headrests, not overly narrow and certainly no worse (probably better) than the 3-4-3 layout you find on some newer 777 aircraft. A blanket and pillow come on each seat, and I was able to sleep on the night flights. There are no personal screens, and the app which you download is hit and miss, the music selection terrible. Bring a book. The food is not great and limited in quantity, but it's free, and on one of the flights I asked for an extra bread roll and was offered an entire second meal. My partner asked for something from the menu card, was told it wasn't available and was then given a gin-tonic for free - so they are making an effort. Staff are generally friendly, hardworking and efficient, given their low numbers, perhaps one negative is that on one flight (Lima-Toronto) grooming standards were laughably low. Connections in Montreal and Toronto were well handled. Of the 5 flights (4 Rouge plus one Air Canada domestic flight from YUL to YYZ), only one was late (BCN-YUL), we were met by Air Canada staff who had new boarding passes ready for the following flight, plus $40 dollars in vouchers which we didn't have time to use, but since they are valid for 1 year, we used them at Toronto airport three weeks later. Our bill at the airport restaurant we chose came close to $70 including alcohol, but staff took the vouchers and waived the difference! Perfect! 1 bag from Toronto-Lima didn't arrive, but probably our fault as we checked it in late. It was delivered to our hotel by the following morning. Points were added to our Lufthansa Miles & More cards. I'd probably look for alternatives next time, but if if value is what you want, then they can deliver.

### "dated and uncomfortable seats"
Toronto to Berlin. This was the worst overseas flight of my life. Horribly dated and uncomfortable seats, very poor beverage and food service, terrible seat positioning (right next to the back toilet, really?!) and overall a horrible decision. Air Canada Rouge has been my worst experience so far, and I would not suggest it to anyone.

### "disappointed with the services"
Toronto to Ft Lauderdale. Air Canada used to be great, with delightful service, great in-flight entertainment, legroom, and comfortable seats. When they realized that they have the monopoly and can charge whatever they want, they took the oldest planes from the main fleet, got rid of their IFEs, cut down on crew members, packed more seats onto the plane, and charged the same price as they used to with Air Canada rouge. They can't lose customers because a lot of people have no where else to go! I checked in early for my flight, on the app, but I received row 32, the last row on the plane. IFE weren't supposed to be an issue for me because they replaced it with mobile entertainment. Air Canada gave me an alert saying the service is unavailable on my fully capable product, running the correct version of iOS and the app. Ok, we don't have IFE, let's buy wifi. Right? Nope. 8.95 CAD/hour. I'm very disappointed with the services provided on Air Canada rouge.

### "seats are extremely small"
Not Verified |  Victoria to Toronto. Extremely disappointed with Air Canada Rouge, and feel like we were tricked into using this carrier when booking our trip on Air Canada's website. Major complaints were that the seats are extremely small with no cushioning or padding, I'm a size medium woman, about 170lbs, 5'8" and I barely fit in the seats, my knees were definitely in the back of the poor guy in front of me. Also, on a 4.5hr flight, we were offered water/beverages only one time, and it took over 2hrs to get the drinks going because they were so slow to move their way through the plane. I wish they wouldn't offer the charged snacks/meals because it really makes the service extremely slow. Line-ups for the one washroom were epic, they allowed about 10 people to line-up at once so we were constantly being elbowed and stepped on as we barely fit in the seats and armrests are so tiny. Service from flight crew was okay, but they were more concerned with gossiping in the back then providing water and comfort to their passengers. Flight crew was constantly announcing in French and not English and was loud. Rouge player didn't work. Bought a $40 wifi pass that didn't work. Dreading our next flight, also with Rouge unfortunately. Wish I could get a refund. Don't book with them! !

### "give a big warm shoutout"
Just wanted to give a big warm shoutout to Diana, an amazing flight attendant on the Toronto To Prague flight on Aug 24 (Flight AC1923). She was so personable and helpful during the flight. I watched as she handled many tired and fussy passengers with ease and grace. Diana smiled from the moment we boarded to the minute we landed.

### "no Spanish speaking staff"
Bogota to Toronto. There was no Spanish speaking staff on the flight. I had to translate for the passenger seating beside me. The crew spoke a lot over the PA about things that were not important (creating memories, and other irrelevant information) and did not provide information like length of flight, temperature on arrival, etc. The pilot never greeted the passengers with information about the flight. They have an app for their entertainment system and the choices are outdated and extremely limited. There is no radio option to listen to varied music. The flight left in the evening and instead of offering a dinner, they offered a breakfast. I was starving when I went on board and I was offered only a candy bar and chips. Nothing till around 4 hours after and it was a breakfast choice. The ground crew were extremely disorganized on check in and boarding.

### "seats are quite uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  Montreal to Barcelona. The seats are quite uncomfortable and there is little to no leg room. When my girlfriend and I sat down, we noticed there weren't any screens on the seats. This came to a surprise, however, the staff informed us that there would be wifi on board to watch tv & movies during the flight. After takeoff, we inquired about the wifi and that it was not working. It was only then that they had mentioned we needed to download the app before takeoff, however, we could rent an iPad for $10 - although $10 is minimal in comparison to the cost of the flight, it's kick in the gut if you ask me. After dinner was served at 10:00pm, we would expect that the lights would have turned off. This was not the case. The staff did not dim any lights until 12:00am, and they proceeded to turn them back on at 2:00am to serve refreshments and breakfast. There was no personal overhead airvent, and it was left up to the staff to turn it on and off. I found myself cold, needing a blanket one minute and then so hot I'm sweating the next. I will pay the extra money to avoid Air Canada Rouge in the future.

### "product is severely lacking"
Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. Overall, the flight was okay, but there was several problems. The wifi on the aircraft was not working, and nor was the Rouge Player. Air Canada needs to step it up when it comes to their Rouge Planes, as this may prevent people from flying with them in the future. Other than that, seat was uncomfortable, and the meal service was quite limited especially going to the back rows, where it’s usually only Shawarma wraps and Soup left. To Conclude, Air Canada needs to start putting more money into Rouge as in my opinion the product is severely lacking.

### "no screen in this A319"
We flew from Vancouver to Panama City, connecting through Toronto. Flying with AC Rouge was everything but a good experience. Their planes are quite antiquated. On the A321, from Vancouver to Toronto, the USB plug was not functioning and the seat wouldn't recline correctly. The seat pitch is ridiculously small. Don't expect a snack or a blanket. The light was on for the 5 hours of the red eye flight. The entertainment system needs serious revamping. Hardware is old and not responsive. Poor content doesn't help the touch lag or the offset discrepancy. On the plus side, the staff on that flight was very friendly. The flight from Toronto to Panama City was worse. There's no screen in this A319 configuration so we were asked to download a 80 MB application which proved to be useless since the wifi was not working. There was USB plug to charge your device anyway so you don't know if your phone wouldn't die in the middle of a movie. No snack was offered. Last, the staff was not so friendly.

### "missing our connection"
Boston to Venice via Montreal. Our flight was delayed out of Boston and we ended up missing our connection. After a complete lack of information in Montreal we waited in line for an hour for what we though was rebooking our flights but turned out was just to issue us vouchers for a hotel and informed we had to call to change our flights. Missing our connection meant we lost a hotel in Venice and our train tickets the next day to Rome. There was a flight directly to Rome for less money that AC refused to put us on because we didn't book that flight. The Boston terminal is small, and has poor air conditioning.

### "lose a luggage on a direct flight"
Toronto to Berlin. I flew with Rouge and even bought the upgrade to Premium Economy. Well its been 9 days now. Everyone on the same flight that had a priority tag on their bag did not get their bag. They are very uncommunicative. I had to fight to figure what I can spend to at least have the necessities : $150 US. And after calling every day and them telling me a manager will call me back within 24 hours, no manager has called. $150 US for a trip to Europe? How do you lose luggage on a direct flight?

### "you have to do better"
vNagoya to Vancouver. First time flying Air Canada Rouge - will never fly them again. Our leg over to Japan, we flew Air Canada, but Rouge on the return. The bulkhead section leg room was very cramped. My husband is 6'3" and that is why we upgraded to preferred economy and paid extra to sit in these seats, we anticipated much more leg room, you couldn't even stretch out your legs at all, we would have been better with a regular seat. The dinner was disgusting. Have attached a photo, but not even sure what that dark rectangle thing was in my food, it looked inedible. The breakfast sandwich was disgusting. The seats were so thin. There were no TV screens in seats, but you could rent an IPAD for $10, I did not need to rent, I had my own. The movie/tv selections were from years ago and not that many options to choose from. And the wifi connection was poor, took several attempts to get the app to open and load the movies. No charging ports. Flight attendants. I had 2 kids behind me that kept kicking the seat. Finally I called a flight attendant and asked if they were traveling unaccompanied, (because I didn't see and adult) I explained what was happening and she looked behind me and said, "They're going to sleep now" - not they are not, they were just kicking my seat. They did it again later and I just turned around and gave them a look...they didn't do it anymore. Overall this was the worst flight ever, domestic and International. Air Canada Rouge, you have to do better....much better!

### "Domestic was much better "
Barcelona to Victoria via Toronto. I flew both premium rouge and economy (but with preferred seating) A real mixed bag! The domestic parts of our journey were great but the international ones were awful. International flight 1: We paid for premium rouge for the 'extra legroom'. We got less legroom than economy passengers due to the bulkhead. The website did not detail this to us - we would never have chosen those seats for a 9 hour flight. I'm 5'3" and found it cramped. International flight 2: I had to ask for a pair of headphones twice (they took over 45 minutes to deal with my apparently complicated enquiry) and they never came back to take a snack order from me even though they promised they would 'be right back'. The food left me very hungry (I do not have a big appetite) and was awful. The whole international experience was bad. Domestic service was for some reason much better and the planes were cleaner. Canadian hospitality perhaps - this inconsistency in service is not fun on long haul flights.

### "seats are so close"
Not Verified | Kelowna to North Bay. Staff was good and flight service was pleasant. My beef is with the seating and lack of entertainment system. The seats are so close that anyone over 5.5 ft tall is jammed in like a sardine. Finally after 5 flights I was able to get the Rouge player to work on my wife's note book. The movie selection is poor and it's much more cumbersome than the in seat players from before. This was my last Rouge flight.

### "Alcohol is not included"
The interior appeared to me as if not updated since the 1970's, there is no built-in entertainment systems, and the food/drink service was horrendous. They have a wifi entertainment system accessed through personal devices; however, this never worked and numerous people questioned the crew regarding the system and were told the system doesn't work when there are too many people on board. On an 8.5 hour flight, dinner was a small chicken dish and breakfast was a piece of bread. Alcohol is not included with meals when I asked for a full can of ginger ale I was told "We don't give the whole cans. When I then finished my ginger ale and requested another one, I was told that I would have to wait until the cart came back around in a couple hours. My return flight was even longer, the entertainment system didn't work, and the service was poor.

### "no IFE monitors "
This was my first flight with Air Canada rouge and the worst flight experience. We boarded the aircraft facing an over 8 hour transatlantic flight. Shortly after boarding, the flight attendant made an announcement that there is no running water in any of the lavatories. Also, there were no IFE monitors in the seat backs. Passengers had the option to rent an ipad for an additional $10 or download their app and watch on your own device. This had to be done prior to boarding. Naturally, hundreds of us were trying to download at the same time. Therefore, it took a very long time, just to realize that the movie selection was sparse and terribly outdated.

### "on-board service is fine"
Toronto to Edinburgh. I have regularly used this service in Premium Rouge since it was started 5 years ago. I did not Check-in at YYZ as I had connected from an AC main-line service from Denver. I did however use the International Business lounge at YYZ, this being available to PE passengers at a $25.00 fee. Boarding for EDI was as expected, PE being the first group to board as there is no business class. The flight was not completely full; however, all seats were occupied in the Premium Rouge section. The seats were a little less comfortable than those on AC main-line with perhaps a little less leg room as well. This service departed YYZ early evening, drinks with nibbles preceded dinner. There were 2 choices for the main course, steak or chicken. The meal was serviced onto a Linen table cloth with china ware, real glasses for drinks, and china mugs for tea/coffee. That was the situation for the first meal. There was a dedicated Premium Rouge FA, this was not the case with AC main-line in PE on a recently taken service. The second meal or very light breakfast was a bit dis-jointed in its presentation and distribution, this may have been due to the aircraft flying in turbulent conditions for at least an hour prior to the breakfast offering. The turbulent conditions appeared to have alarmed a fair number of passengers on board. Some words of assurance from the Flight Deck crew would have been appropriate here, however none was offered. The flight arrived at EDI on time at the stand, however as dis-embarkation was via steps to the ground and a bus transfer to the terminal, delays subsequently occurred. Based on this experience, the international Premium Rouge on-board service is fine, much better than it was 5 years ago when AC Rouge first took to the skies. It’s not international Business class and is not sold by AC as such.

### "entertainment does not work"
Toronto to Prague. Flight was on time, check in was quick via the self check in kiosks and drop-off. But the plane was old and dirty. On board entertainment does not work during the whole flight.

### "food was overpriced"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Cancun. I and my travel companion were early at the check-in. We asked for aisle seats but got one in the middle instead. It also took the check-in person 15 minutes to change the spelling of my name. The stewardess who served me handed out water like it was a precious beverage. She only filled the small plastic cup 1/4 fill and never came around again. The food was overpriced and none of it was appealing to me. The space underneath the seat barely fit my purse.

### "seats way to close together"
Vancouver to Honolulu. First and foremost the seats are way to close together now. I'm only 5'10 and an average build. I was extremely uncomfortable with no leg room what so ever. With the leg room I did it was very difficult to stretch out, as well avoid the pasta that was on the floor from who ever was on the plane prior to this flight. For a 6hr flight. Air Canada rouge has made their seats extremely uncomfortable. Closest comparison I can think of is a well used office chair. There was no snack provided as part of the flight. Not to mention their app that barely works. I tried to work it from my iPhone, iPad, my wife iPhone and a laptop. Not one device was able to get this app to work. Finally after complaining to a flight attendant were we able to get a iPad from them. Luckily bringing my own snacks, trying to put it in the seat pouch, I was greeted with the left over garbage again from someone before me. I'd strongly suggest staying away from Air Canada rouge. The flight back was not much better at all, even after paying an additional $70 US for a seat with more leg room.

### "very poor experience"
Columbus to Venice via Toronto, we were booked on our outbound flight with Air Canada rouge. I say unfortunately because the resulting experience with them was just that. In addition to losing my luggage, which I did not receive the entire time while in Italy, the 8+ hour flight was on an old plane with no built-in TV's. They offered iPads which could be rented at a cost, however the in-flight staff never offered these to my wife and I. The food was sub-par, and overall was a very poor experience. Air Canada rouge wants 35 days to review my claim and assess whether or not I will be reimbursed for the $500 USD I had to spend in order to put together a wardrobe to get through the trip. In addition, the team working on the claim is not accessible other than through submission of forms on their website. Obviously they do not wish to interact with customers that they have inconvenienced, I am someone whom never writes reviews, however I felt compelled to do so on this experience as it was that bad.

### "flight was completely pleasant"
Toronto to Tampa. While it is understandable that different individuals will have varying experiences with a budget carrier, my flight with Air Canada rouge was completely pleasant. Check-in was handled by the normal AC staff, and the premium line for Star Gold passengers provided immediate service. Onboard, the attendant serving the business cabin couldn't have been more pleasant, cheerful, and proactive. There were only 8 passengers for the 16 available seats, and the seat pitch was excellent. We departed on-time and arrived in Tampa 15 minutes early. A tasty and complete breakfast was served on this 8:35AM flight. Drinks were served, but lamentably, they had not loaded any of the sparkling wine that appears on the menu. Inflight entertainment in the premium cabin is provided by ipads loaded with a good selection of movies. I would not hesitate to fly rouge again, and I would recommend them to my friends.

### "it was a wonderful flight"
❌ Not Verified |  Me and my husband and our two kids flew this past April with Rouge from Calgary to Maui and it was a wonderful flight. I am a nervous flyer and the staff were so kind and attentive. They were wonderful with my kids and I would 100% book and fly with them. Kudos to you guys!

### "Hard to find something positive"
Flew Air Canada rouge from Toronto to Barcelona. Hard to find something positive about this airline. Old and noisy 767. No IFE or moving map display. Hardly edible plastic food. Rude staff and unable to fix anything for you, we had a 7h night flight with our baby and they could not get us a bassinet, even if there were bassinet seats on the plane. Will avoid them at all costs in the future.

### "callous disregard to comfort"
Toronto to Tampa. Plane obnoxiously too small for transport of human beings. I am 5'11" and could barely move in the seat. I put my purse on the floor at my feet as I always do on flights. I have a very moderate size cross body purse. I am not a heavy person and I barely had enough room to get my purse from the floor to my lap. The entire flight I felt like a sardine in a can. Truly the least room in seating I have ever had. The airline used a different aircraft or differently configured aircraft on the return trip from Toronto to Tampa verses the flight up, as the flight up was fine. After this experience, I will make it a personal mission to avoid Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge. Granted some can upgrade seats, but general comfort should not be forced. If I were 300 pounds or 6'7" then fine, I would be out of the ordinary and should consider paying up for seating. The callous disregard to comfort is a financial game by the airline who obviously has zero regard for their customers. Well, in this case, ex-customers.

### "Seats are very tight"
Orlando to Montreal. Seats are very tight. Small aircraft. The stewardess was unfriendly. No smile. We used this for both destination and return flight. No TVs and advertises wifi but if you don’t have a device you need to pay to rent one. There is no room for carry on as well. No one at the gate to assist with questions.

### "Premium economy just fine"
Toronto to Puerto Vallarta. I have not flown in Economy but I find the Premium economy just fine. Also worth noting that Rouge fly to locations that Air Canada do not. I had to get 12 people from Barcelona to Toronto on a tight schedule and Rouge were the only direct flight. The same 12 people have to go to Dublin and Rouge have the only direct flight except for charter airlines. Rouge is a budget Airline that might be your first clue but I suspect their quality is way up there. If you have a choice of Air Canada or Air Canada Rouge its tough to complain if your going for the cheaper price.

### "Absolutely awful"
Absolutely awful. The attendants were lovely, but I’ve never been on a more uncomfortable flight. I felt as though I was sitting on a metal bar. When I boarded the plane, I went straight to the washroom. It was absolutely filthy and the toilet was full. Had obviously not been cleaned between flights. As a result, it absolutely stank, the entire flight. There was garbage in my seat pocket, and the seat was dirty. I will never fly Air Canada Rouge again, despicable.

### "Avoid at all costs"
When I booked a trip from London Heathrow to Kelowna, I didn't notice that the third leg of my trip was with Rouge. However, this oversight became abundantly clear when I boarded the plane. At 5'11", I couldn't sit normally in my seat without my knees in the back of the traveller's seat in front of me. I am also tired of opening the seat pocket to find the last traveller's garbage left behind for me - and this on a flight where the pilot accounts for our thirty-minute flight delay because the plane was slow to get through the (overnight) cabin service. This reminded me that it was not my first time on Rouge, having flown between Calgary and Kelowna on this AC service and experiencing the same thing once in the past. I didn't even bother with food or drink on the flight, opting to grab something at Pearson instead. Super economy service, without the super economy price. Avoid at all costs.

### "the worst airline to fly on"
Flew Ft Lauderdale to Montreal. Air Canada rouge is the worst airline to fly on. You cannot put your hand luggage in vertically. There are six seats per row in first class. There are seat posts that restrict your foot room. The seats are extraordinarily uncomfortable. The staff are friendly but the plane is impossible. We go to great lengths never to fly Rouge. We are making an extra stop on a flight to Europe this summer just to avoid Rouge. Air Canada’s wonderful brand is being destroyed by Rouge.

### "tend to ruin your vacation before it starts"
Flew Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. I am going to try and write this in a nice way. Let’s just say that Air Koryo, now has a competitor. The planes of Air Canada rouge are dated and old, the staff are arrogant and do not really know what customer service means. I asked for tea twice and no one ever brought any, I tried to call the flight attendant with the call button several times, but I guess they disconnected this function because it bothers them. The only reason I believe Air Canada rouge still exists is because they have no competition and they force you to take it as there is no other options to fly where you want to go. You pay the same price as with regular Air Canada, yet smiles from the staff are extra. I will avoid every route this company flies as they tend to ruin your vacation before it starts and if you do enjoy your vacation, they make sure your blood pressure rises on your way back home.

### "there is no one there to help"
Flying from Dubai to Philadelphia via Toronto, we had occassion to spend a couple of hours in the Maple Leaf Lounge (had to pay for this even though we were traveling business class). When we arrived in the lounge, there were no seat. It was so crowded we couldn't move. We stood with our carry on and personal items for some time until someone got up and gave us seats. We couldn't even make our way to the bar or the food it was so congested. When it was time to leave, we learned that some of the congestion was from a long line that wrapped around the entire lounge. We were stunned and very stressed that we would miss our plane. We were told that the elevators were running slow and there was no stair access. We nearly missed our flight to Philadelphia. We filed a complaint with Customer Service on Nov. 12 and received an acknowledgement on Nov. 20 saying "no need to follow up. We're on it! We received no further response. We followed with Customer Service up on 1/17, 1/31,/2/9 and 2/10. Each time we were told that we would hear back in 48 hours. Each time, no response. Apparently there is no concern for passengers This makes one wonder how they are about safely and other functions. I would not recommend this airline because if you have to deal with them there is no one there to help!

### "disappointed in the food service"
I was very disappointed in the food service. This was a mid-haul, 5h morning flight, and there were no vegetarian food options available, only chicken wraps and breakfast sandwiches with pork were available for purchase. Non-meat eaters had a choice of dry granola snacks and candy for the duration of the flight. I find this unacceptable, and I'm sure I wasn't the only vegetarian on the flight. Cabin staff were not apologetic.

### "really disappointed with today"
❎ Not Verified |  Montreal to Las Vegas. I am a 50k member which is expensive for the lousy service I received today. Arriving at check in my friend on my reservation gets a seat and I have no seat assignment. They promised me I was on the flight no matter what. They told me to check at the lounge at 7:40am and nothing was done. I get to the gate and they told me that they can’t board all passengers and that they would have to wait until volunteers get off the plane and that I would be re-routed through Chicago. I waited until 8:40 (time of departure), all passengers got on and they put me on very last minute. The staff were not friendly. The crew was petty and had serious attitude. I asked for 2 iPads and WiFi was reset a million times and didn’t work nothing worked for an hour and a half). They told me they would refund my purchase. As I waited for all drinks to be served I managed to watch some silly movie at some point and asked for 20 more minutes to just see the end and the crew member Ishmael told me he would have to charge me 5$ (half the value because I was managing to watch), it’s not for the 10$ each, its for the aggravation and pettiness! We asked for the usual rouge pretzels, and were  answered we charge for everything! As a 50k member I am really disappointed with today. Everything we asked it was like we were annoying the crew. What a stressful flight

### "quite unacceptable in my view"
Flew Air Canada rouge from Honolulu to Vancouver. We arrived at check-in bag drop at 8.45 pm, almost 3 hours before takeoff, having checked in online. There was at most 2 agents for this line, compared to 4-6 for those doing the entire process. Each passenger or group took as much as 25 minutes, with the online check-in ignored. We stood in line 1 hour 20 minutes. We barely made our boarding time, then sat in the plane for another 80 minutes waiting for luggage and passengers before we finally left more than an hour late. Passengers were getting extremely frustrated. This is the worst check-in I have ever experienced. It was quite frankly embarrassing as Alaska Airlines passengers sailed through their check-in. It was quite unacceptable in my view.

### "nightmare experiences with them"
We were at the airport and ready to board our flight from Pearson Airport to Grenada on January 25 2018 and the counter person asked us if 15 people would voluntarily back out of their trip on flight AC1732, and that they were trying to set up a new flight for the next day. At first we thought he was just being funny! Needless to say people started to worry and were screaming. Their excuse was that the large plane had mechanical issues so they had to send a smaller plane, which could not handle all the weight. We boarded the plane while customers were irate and still yelling. We were stranded on the plane for 1.5 hours. Finally they boarded everyone but informed us we had to de-fuel due to weight and would be going to Nassau Bahamas for fueling. Delayed there for an hour also. So our 5 hour flight turned into 8 long hours on a cramped seat. Half way through the flight we were hungry and were informed that they ran out of food and beer. The flight attendants were great. It was and is the airline I am upset with. Last year we also had issues with Air Canada when we book direct flights from London to Montreal for our flight to San Andres. A week before flight we get a phone call and informing us that we had 2 stops now, 1 in Toronto and 1 in Ottawa. We were very upset as we had paid premium dollars for a direct flight and was never compensated. So I have tried this airline twice and had nightmare experiences with them both times, it will be the last time I deal with this airline. My husband and I fly at least twice a year and trust me it will not be with this airline.

### "Patience wore thin"
The trip from Toronto to Tampa was uneventful and on time. The seats in that old 767 have been swapped out and replaced with a thin, hard version with such little legroom as to make my short legs cramp up. Return Flight: the aircraft was very late arriving at Tampa and so we were vary late leaving. Arrival at Pearson and we were kept in the aircraft for an extra 40 minutes, near the gate as Rouge had no place to dock. Another plane had to be loaded and then taxi away before we could dock.The Captain told us the delay was was make everything perfectly safe. Patience wore thin and as we finally exited one woman scolded the Captain and head stewardess for the long wait before docking and told him that his words treated us like children. Why could they not just tell us what was obvious, that because we were late Rouge had no gate reserved. She was given a condescending: Have a Nice Night as they walked away. Little things make a large difference in air travel. We are looking into finding a less annoying carrier.

### "service was friendly as usual"
A good flight from Calgary to Frankfurt in premium economy. There was a slight initial delay due to weather on the departure end, but time was made up once we were in the air. The service was friendly as usual, and the plane was clean. Entertainment was good, with a choice of many genres of movies in different languages. The intercom system wasn't working too well, with the result that the safety announcements weren't fully audible - but everyone knows all about those anyway. I'm flummoxed by the negative reviews on this site, particularly in areas that the airlines themselves have no control over (weather delays, seat designs, etc). But I have personally never had an issue with Air Canada rouge.

### "they should be ashamed"
Flew Calgary to Cancun. We booked our family vacation through Air Canada Vacation which was the worst mistake we have ever made. After 4 successful trips to Mexico via Sunwing and WestJet we found a great deal with Air Canada so thought let’s try it. Our first problem was arriving at the airport to find out our flight was delayed 4 hours, which they did not update on their website, they said no vouchers to my family but most of the passengers got them. After the then 5 hour delay we sat on the tarmac for an hour and with a 6 hour flight were offered only beverages, everything else you must pay for. Upon arrival no assistance was given to help passengers find our shuttle. Everyone was lost and wondering where to go. Finally got the shuttle and arrived at our resort to find out that Air Canada gave the hotel the wrong room information which meant we had one night in a lower priced room then had to move. We were highly annoyed to be woken up at 8am (6am Canadian time after arriving at 11pm) to be told to come to a meeting, we did not attend and then were woken up three mornings in a row by a very rude Air Canada Rep. The grand finale of this trip was leaving for our shuttle to find out we were delayed 6 hours and Air Canada would not give us a later shuttle option. They expected everyone to sit at the airport for over 9 hours. The annoying rep of course was nowhere to be found again leaving numerous passengers stranded and frustrated. Will never book Air Canada again, they should be ashamed.

### "not comfortable for long trips"
As a low-cost airline under Air Canada, the rouge flights provides narrow seat space in the economy cabin with old aircraft's which are not comfortable for long trips. The rouge flights using intranet WIFI system (no Internet service) to an alternative on-flight entertainment system, so there is no screen on the seats. Two passengers have to share one electric socket for charging devices. The passengers have to download the app on the cell phone or tablet before on board the flight to access the entertainment system. The cabin staff service is the same as the regular Air Canada flight, which is pretty good.

### "top-notch service"
I've always loved Air Canada and their service. I was coming back to Edmonton from Puerto Vallarta a day after Christmas. My friend got really sick before the flight (food poisoning), the flight attendant was very proactive and concerned about my friends condition, she checked up on us several times, offered peppermint/lemon tea to my friend in order to help her upset stomach. She was very accommodating and her fellow crew member was also very kind and tended to our needs. This experience reassures me that in the future if I needed assistance, they will help me with top-notch service just like the experience my friend received.

### "priority bag tag ripped off"
Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Service was okay, staff at gate we’re a bit rude but staff on the plane were lovely. Had a great cheese and fruit plate. But the downer is that a priority bag tag was ripped off my baseball bat box and it came after all my luggage, which also had priority and came after some people with no status.

### "excellent customer service"
Las Vegas to Calgary. My wife and I flew in Business Class on an Air Canada Rouge flight from Las Vegas to Calgary. Typically, the Business Class service on Rouge is good - on this flight it was exceptional. One Flight Attendant went above and beyond to provide excellent customer service. He made our flight a real pleasure and deserves credit for his efforts. We are very grateful for his care and attentions

### "staff were trying their best though"
Paid full Latitude fare for a flight pass ticket from MIA to YYZ recently. Overall a tragically disappointing product from AC. Everything from the check-in experience to cabin cleanliness to food quality was disappointing. They are using the tired old B767s on the Rouge routes. Premium Economy seats look like hand-me downs from another airline - Rouge hasn't been flying long enough to see so much wear. Overhead bin space is ultra-tight. One the whole bin in row 1 is unavailable causing a ripple effect down the aisle. MIA always closes the J security checkpoint at night. The remaining one at H has no TSA Precheck line, no premium line, and there are some very large flights going to South America at this time from the same area. Result is a massive pileup at security with no way out. I asked the check-in staff about this, and they were utterly apathetic. There's a new policy that cabin bags need a security tag from the airline. They don't tell you this, so if you checked in online, and wait in the security line, you get sent back to get tags from the airline. How about an email notification in advance? Food in Rouge Premium was mediocre. The IFE selection was disappointing and annoying because you needed to have an iPad on your lap, or the tray out all the time. The staff were trying their best though, and the wine was decent. That was about the only saving grace.

### "about on par with Air Canada"
Toronto to Puerto Vallarta. First time on Air Canada rouge, and based on the reviews was expecting the worst when in reality it was about on par with Air Canada. Same menu, same service. although the attendants seemed more like servers at a Kelseys rather than professional flight crew. Had my own iPad and did find a couple of movies to watch. The flight departed and arrived on time as did my luggage so no complaints there either. I missed the moving map and there was no communication from the flight deck until the descent. The seats really weren't an issue until the person in front reclined theirs, I'm only 5"6 and their seat was jammed against my knees. The person refused to straighten the seat back so I could get out to use the washroom. had to squeeze out over the armrest. On my return flight I booked the preferred seat at the wing exit and was much more comfortable. Similar experience, departed and arrived on time, same food choices as on AC and no updated from the flight deck.

### "my bags delivered after 10 days"
Venice to Toronto via Montreal. At my arrival in Toronto I discovered that my luggage was missing. it's annoying but it happens. I had to fight for 10 days in order to have my luggage delivered at home. I spent hours in sterile discussions with an overseas call center. they did all kind of irrational actions. My luggage was sent for some unknown reason to a minor airport in CT at 5 hours from my house and they wanted me to drive there to pick it up. I refused and I told them that the closest airport to my house was Rochester NY. they did not believe me and insisted that the closest one was in CT. Then after many calls I spoke with somebody that seemed to have more brain. I was wrong, my luggage was sent to Chicago. I wanted to cry. I restarted calling the craziest call center on this planet and they told me not to worry, the baggage would have delivered to my front porch the day after. After 2 days without news I recalled them and I discovered that my luggage was in Buffalo NY and it was in the hands of Fedex. I was quite happy, it was the end of the nightmare. I asked for a tracking number but the Air Canada representative was not able to give it to me. I insisted and he told me to wait. I waited some minutes and he told me that Fedex was going to deliver my luggage in less than one hour. It was midnight here in the States and I understood that he was inventing something just in order to get rid of me. I had my bags delivered after 10 days. I will never fly with them again. It has been a nightmare.

### "should be deemed a low cost airline"
Flew Phoenix to Toronto. This airline should be deemed a low cost airline. The seats are very uncomfortable with little to no padding, hard to sit on for more than an hour. The bathrooms are very worn out. It was very hot and stuffy on this flight, when I had flown on another Rouge flight between Las Vegas and Toronto it was freezing - which leads me to believe their air conditioning systems have two settings, on full blast or off. The entertainment system is a joke. Sometimes you simply can't access it, if you do you find one or two new movies or TV shows, the rest are many years old. The electricity plug did not work and I was told by the attendant - sorry, it's pretty common on these flights. I would try to avoid these planes as much as possible. Unfortunately Air Canada has got us by the throat and only offers Rouge planes to many destinations. Rouge should be offered at half the price of regular Air Canada flights.

### "great service, great price"
I would like to thank the amazing crew on flight AC1777 from Puerto Plata to Toronto for bringing the Haloween spirit into our Halloween evening flight, greeting passengers with Happy Halloween wishes dressed with Halloween Head bands and giving out candies to passengers. It was very heartwarming, exciting and pleasant and it made me feel so blessed that I live in such a beautiful and rich in tradition country. Maybe I will be lucky to fly with them again on Air Canada Rouge flights. Thank you also to Captain and his assistant. I fly quite often with Air Canada Rouge and as a senior I am very grateful for great service, great price and safe flights.

### "service that made this flight great"
Zurich to Toronto. We had bulkhead seats as my husband is 6 foot 7. They were great for him. Even though the flight had a fair amount of turbulence, the crew kept at it with awesome service. We used the entertainment and liked the selections available to us. For us it was the happy crew and the service that made this flight great. Thanks!

### "will fly with this airline again"
Toronto to Amsterdam. This was a great flight with super attentive staff. They really had the service ethic down pat. Our seats were very comfortable and as the flight was fairly quiet. The take off and landing were easy and we both arrived as refreshed as you could expect. We will fly with this airline again!

### "no wifi and no TV"
Toronto to New York. We were supposed to leave 19:15 they just announce (at 19:40) that we are not taking off until 21:00 at best. My last time flying with these clowns, very bad experience back and forth from New York to Greece and back. Inflight from Toronto to Athens no wifi and no TV set same at the return flight.

### "I was very satisfied"
Toronto to Athens. This flight was booked as part of a package tour for us from Toronto to Athens. After reading all the poor reviews about Rouge, I took the flight with great trepidation I need not have worried, our flight to Athens and back was on time, the cabin staff were the usual courteous helpful people that we normally find on Air Canada, seating was the compact format that one finds on an economy flight but I have known worse. The food was about normal for inflight food. Only the entertainment was worse with the need for your own device and a special AP preloaded. The plane was clean and as comfortable as one can expect from an older aircraft where the seats have been well used. On the whole I was very satisfied knowing that I was saving money on an economy air line.

### "think it is time for a change"
Toronto to Saint Lucia. I have been flying Air Canada for over 40 years and for at least the last 20 years the breakfast has been the parsley omelette with chicken sausage. I think it is time for a change I believe it would be a welcome change to many passengers.

### "unbelievably bad experience"
Unbelievably bad experience. No movies or WiFi in the 10h flight from Toronto to Athens. The food was below average (chicken or pasta were the choices). They did not offer any wine or beer with the food (unless you purchase it and still they won't accept Discover credit cards). They let you know onboard that you may see some movies via an app which you should have downloaded while on the ground. The only good about my trip was that we arrived 1h early. I'm not going to fly with them anymore.

### "you chose to buy this ticket"
Casablanca to Chicago via Montreal. My family and I was went on vacation to Morocco from Chicago. For some reason they weren't able to book my flight completely with theirs and I had all routes with the 6 of them except for going home from Montreal back to Chicago I had a layover of about 8 hours. After being in Morocco for 9 days on the road and falling sick, I was wanting to get home with my family. We  requested them to allow that to happen. I could not afford the 150 dollars change fee and they saw my family board a plane with empty seats available but refuse to put me on it even though the baggage could have been transferred over. Then there was another flight 4 hours later that they didn't want to put me on either and said you chose to buy this ticket.

### "tricked into flying this substandard airline"
Picked Air Canada to fly from Toronto to Miami for a business event. Picked it mainly because it was nonstop. Little did I know about the trick that was pulled on me. I have flown AC several times in the past though lately I had not. Previously I thought the AC service hovered around average in terms on North American major carriers. For this flight, I missed the part that said "flight operated by AC Rouge". I am 5'10" and there was no way I could sit without my knees constantly getting hammered by the seat in the front. The plane looked like it hadn't been updated in decades and hadn't been cleaned in years. I could go on about how terrible the flight and plane were, but the most terrible part was that I was tricked into flying this, thinking it was Air Canada. It's supposed to be their "low-cost vacation carrier". Later I discovered that now all AC flights between Toronto to Phx, Miami, FLL, and many other warmer US destinations are being operated by Rouge exclusively. On any week day many or most passengers to these destinations are not vacationers. They are business people. People from Toronto don't fly to Phx or Miami only on vacation. Many trips are for business. Even if for vacation, people should not tricked into flying this substandard airline thinking it's something else. A very terrible airline and deceitful too. I will try to avoid AC Rouge at all costs, and AC also in general.

### "lost my luggage too"
Keflavik to Montreal. My legs were buried into the seat in front of me, I am a tall guy, 6'5" I had to squirm the entire flight, including sitting on the tarmac in Keflavik waiting for staff to finish servicing the plane. Lunch was a double Kit Kat bar and a cold, chicken wrap sandwich and a drink. I missed my overnight connections in Montreal and lost my luggage too, did not arrive in Keflavik until the next day and did not get it to the hotel we agreed on until three days after we had stayed there. I spent 10 days without my luggage. Got my luggage when I returned to the Hotel in Reyjakvik at the end of the trip. And they lost it again upon arrival in Montreal and did not get it delivered home until the next day. The inflight staff did what they could.

### "no TV is provided"
Toronto to Budapest. Alcoholic drinks are for sale only during transoceanic trips and no TV is provided. I had recently traveled from St. Lucia to Toronto via Air Canada as well and the policy (which is the same) I thought to be weird but somehow palatable, considering that the flight would last only around 5 hours. But the quality of the experience is almost unbearable when it comes to long haul flights, even with the unquestionable advantage of flying directly.

### "almost no legroom"
I was so excited when I noticed there is finally a direct flight to Berlin. Now, I cannot tell you how disappointed I am. Bad food, no wifi, no wine or beer, almost no legroom (I am tall, so my knees where hitting the seat in front of me). Usually we as Canadians are pretty friendly people but I had the feeling that AC rouge gave their flight attendants a special training in how to be rude. Even easyJet or Ryanair have friendlier service. There is no onboard entertainment, you have no idea where you actually are (not a single screen). My flight from Berlin back got delayed and no one told us what was going on or what to expect. It was really hot at the gate, not enough seats and we didn't even get some water. Next time the one hour layover in Amsterdam or Munich but with proper service, more legroom, friendly flight attendants, a nice glass of wine and a movie.

### "my knees touched the chair in front of me"
Flew Toronto to Iceland. First of all, Air Canada is know to be an unfavourable airline and Rouge definitely lives up to it. This was the first international I've taken where there was no entertainment whatsoever. Sitting in my seat my knees touched the chair in front of me and I'm not a big guy. The staff had the typical Air Canada vibe of hating their lives. Before take off the staff mentioned we would have a hot meal during the flight which turned out to be a small cold wrap. All in all next time I'll spend a couple hundred more and go with a different airline.

### "won't book the flight again"
I booked return flight from Vancouver to Budapest via Toronto. Flight from Toronto to Budapest was delayed 2.5 hours, one of the passengers got intoxicated and was boarded on the flight. Under the influence of alcohol he started arguing and assaulted flight attendant, causing the cancellation of the flight, returning to Toronto and postponing trip for 24 hours. On my way back, flight delayed from Budapest 3 hours, like many passengers I lost connections and ended up in Vancouver at 2:00am, instead of 9:00 pm, paying for taxi service and having a list of other minor complications. I won't book the flight again.

### "my experience was not that bad"
Flew Dublin to Toronto. Despite all the rage I read against this airline, which made me question whether I had made the right decision, I can say that my experience was not that bad. Upside: Service and food was the same quality as on the previous Air Canada flight (SCL-YYZ). I say it's an upside because I expected it to be much worse. Leg room was ok to me too (I'm 175 cm. tall), though recline was poor. Downsides: No in-flight entertainment (you can rent iPads or use your own device), old aircraft, and no window shade in my seat (broken/removed). I wouldn't fly ACR again, not because I had a bad experience, but because I can get something better for the same price.

### "not a bargain flight for me"
Toronto to Athens. Booked Lufthansa but somehow it was an Air Canada rouge flight. The staff were very nice. I am a 5'8" female and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. The entertainment is access to the Rouge app. If you do not bring a laptop with earbuds, you can rent one from Rouge. Glad I brought my kindle. The meal was rubber chicken with a mix of potatoes, carrots and beans. The salad was a very poor version of potato salad. Great for potato lovers. This was not a bargain flight for me.

### "I will fly Rouge again for sure"
Flew Venice to Montreal. Reading all the reviews I was wondering what I had got myself into when choosing Air Canada Rouge. However, it turned out totally different. It's strange when you walk into giant 767 and the seats have no screens, but the wifi entartaiment was working perfectly fine, movie and TV series selection good. Cabin crew were young, but nice and funny and they were helpful. Sodas and water is free, alcohol you need to buy. Food? Surprisingly delicious chicken breast and rice and a salad, also snacks and more drinks for the second meal. After we landed, a visit to pilots at the flight deck was also no problem. So in the end, very good surprise. I know, if you want the perfect service 35000 feet up, that's not the airline of your choice, but for a medical student flying for vacation it's the cheapest way to fly overseas. I will fly Rouge again for sure!

### "declined its customer services"
Calgary to Punta Cana via Montreal. I been flying with AC back and forth since we moved to Canada 5 yrs ago. It was really sad to see how Air Canada has declined its customer services to the lowest level, especially in International flights. If cheap flights means poor service I will prefer to paid more. The plane was so old and dirty. It didn't have any backseat entertainment and or air conditioner in the seat panel. Everything was available for a fee including blankets and pillows, any food, and movies (Ipad for 10 dollars). Next time, I will be sure to double check before I book my international vacations with AC, if I do it again. I will be more that happy to pay a couple extra hundred dollars to have a confortable flight with food and entertainment.

### "found the experience satisfactory"
I flew with my family from Toronto to Prague and back on Air Canada Rouge and found the experience satisfactory, a good value for a lower cost service. We paid $100 extra for seats with extra legroom. The food was reasonable, the wifi entertainment worked on out iPads, there was a power socket for the charger, and the plane interior was clean and in good shape. The flight attendants were a highlight - all provided an energetic, efficient, upbeat service. I had no complaints. I will not hesitate to book Rouge again.

### "do not pay for preferred seats"
We traveled on Air Canada Rouge from Athens to Montreal on August 18 and because the flight is over 10 hours and I am 6 foot 4 we decided to pay 200$ for 2 preferred seats which were supposed to provide more leg room. We were seated in row 27 seat A and C. When we got to our seats we noticed that there was a wall less than 3 feet from the seat providing absolutely no room for leg extension! Furthermore the seat is right next to 3 bathrooms. With almost 300 people on the plane and a 10 hour flight you can imagine the kind of traffic and odors we were subjected to. I complained to the flight attendant who told me that customers always complain about those seats being sold as preferred. Also note that as per the cabin plan supplied on the website when we booked our seats they do not show the wall or the washrooms but some normal seats in front of 27 A and C which is a gross misrepresentation of the actual seating arrangement. Bottom line is these are probably the worst seats on the entire plane but because they are exit rows Air Canada insists on selling them a preferred. It is purely and simply stealing from their customers. Bottom line is do not pay for preferred seats in row 27 and don't even sit in them for free. Air Canada should be stopped from doing this!

### "uncomfortable and small leg room seats"
First time flying on Air Canada Rouge. Pretty bad. 5 hours and 25 minutes sitting in a small size seat from Vancouver to Mexico City. No free food (not even peanuts or cookies). No free alcohol. No in-flight entertainment. All I had was 2-3 small cups of water for the whole flight experience. I was so sore upon arrival due to the uncomfortable and small leg room seats. I am a long time Air Canada frequent flyer, but will never fly again on this "rouge" concept. No wonder Aeromexico is getting a bigger market share for this Vancouver-Mexico City route (they offer free hot meals, in-flight entertainment and even free wine or any cocktail of your preference.

### "not sitting next to each other"
Budapest to Toronto and we found out that we were not sitting next to each other. Young lady at counter was unfriendly and kept telling us that we had to call the Airlines to request our seats to sit by our spouse prior to flying date. She found two seats together at very back of plane. Sitting at back of plane, we never had a choice of food items like rest of plane. Bathroom floor corners were filthy. When we arrived in Toronto, we were held at gate for quite awhile due to having to wait for ground crew to be organized, and because the air bridge could not be attached to plane for us to disembark. We barely made it through customs and onto our next connecting flight to Houston. Our luggage never made it out of Houston and to our final destination and has to be delivered to us the next day.

### "good food, excellent service"
In general we had good flight from Barcelona to Montreal with good food, excellent service and nice staff but we didn't know that the aircraft does not have screens on the seats. People with tablets were able to download the Air Canada rouge app for others there was no choice. Usually when I fly with Lufthansa I don't have to pay for the alcohol but with Air Canada rouge the alcohol is not free.

### "worst flying experience "
San Francisco to Dublin via Vancouver. Air Canada was the worst flying experience we have had. We flew to and from Dublin on this airline and every flight was delayed at least 2 hours. Our flight to Dublin ended up taking 24 hours. They lost our luggage on the return flight and we are still waiting for it. The individuals working for the airline were kind and seemed to be doing their best in a very dysfunctional and inefficient company. On board, the Wifi would not connect and the online entertainment was broken.

### "Excellent meal service"
AC 1967 on 8th August 2017: Flight left and arrived on time even though extremely slow and time consuming passport control just prior to entering boarding area. Seat pitch in Premium Rouge generous but recline not sufficient. Excellent meal service. As on the outbound leg the young and enthusiastic flight attendants in the Premium Rouge cabin were simply great. Their friendliness and eagerness to please was outstanding. On a side-note: they kept the lavatory in front of the Premium Rouge cabin immaculate. Entertainment system via supplied I pad was good but personally missed the possibility of loading the usual "flight-path" feature. Would not hesitate to book Premium Rouge on long-haul again.

### "our experience was fantastic"
We flew Air Canada Rouge nonstop round trip from Toronto to Venice in July. The equipment in both directions was a Boeing 767-300ER, which was obviously an older aircraft from AC’s livery. My family and I were expecting the worst after reading multiple horrific reviews of AC Rouge online, and it seemed like we were going to pay a serious penalty for the very low advance fare we found to fly their “Premium Rouge” product. Happily, our experience was fantastic and we’d fly this discount airline again in a second. Upon boarding on both ends of our journey, we were offered glasses of water or juice and hot towel service. Meals on both flights were a notch above what I’ve experienced on legacy carriers in US domestic first in recent years; everything was served on ceramic plates with stainless silverware and linen napkins. Wine and cocktails were complimentary in this class, and while not a varied menu, the service was generous. The seating is very comfortable; seat pitch is listed  as 37”, and that seemed accurate. I am a big guy at 6’2” (1.88m) and 280 lbs (127kg) and was completely at ease with plenty of room to stretch out. The 767 does not have individual air jets for circulation, but this did not bother me on these flights. If you’re concerned it will, you may want to pack a USB-powered fan. Every 2-seat row in premium rouge has a power outlet that accepts 110-220v plugs. When the person in front of you fully reclines, these outlets are tricky to access, so figure it out when you get seated. As mentioned in other reviews, to use in-flight-entertainment on these planes, you need to download the Air Canada app on your iOS or Android device ahead of time, or use the provided iPads onboard (free for Premium, charge for other classes). It works very well and has a decent selection of movies. Note that the onboard streaming system will not work during the flight’s climb-out up to about 10K feet (approx the first 20-30 mins. of the flight). Premium rouge passengers also receive priority boarding and priority baggage handling - our luggage was waiting for us when we cleared customs in Venice, which was very unexpected given our past experience at this airport. Our in-flight crews could not have been more kind or professional; legacy carriers in the US could seriously take a lesson from these folks. If you are looking for lie-flat seats and the like, this is not your airline. If you are flying your family for vacation and want a reasonably priced product that offers a very nice international premium economy product, than look no further than Air Canada Rouge.

### "extremely disappointed with service"
Toronto to Bridgetown. We left at 8.15 am and travelling with a small child (3 years old) after leaving early in the morning. While sitting in the seat I realized that my knees were rubbing the butt of the passenger seated in front of metal. There was a long line for the toilets since economy only had two toilets. I requested a cup of warm chocolate for the child but the only warm beverages available were coffee and tea. I am extremely disappointed with this service.

### "plane was so dirty I have no words"
Welcome to Air Canada Rouge, our top of the line air taxi features chairs and retractable folding tables. I would not wish this flight to my worst enemy. I was traveling with a 1 year old and my 4 month pregnant wife, we were not expecting any and we certainly did not get any special treatment. When I tried to do online booking at exactly 24 hours prior to flight it told me everything was packed and we had to sit at the exact spots, we couldn't change to go to a 2 seater, instead we were in a 3 seat spot, couldn't get a baby bassinet either. 11 hour flight, no TVs or any entertainment, this plane had to be at least 30-40 years old. They rented ipads for $10, yes the last thing I want to do is hold an ipad with a 1 year old in my lap, meanwhile the batteries kept dying on the ones that other passengers got, I had an ipad of my own which couldn't load the content as I didn't download the app prior to flight, thats what I was thinking while boarding with my family "how to download the app". I am 6"ft3 the seats were made I think for someone who is 3"ft 1, the armrest conveniently has the controls to call the staff and turn on the lights, which was very helpful every 5 seconds when I accidentally kept calling staff who very rudley come by and turn off the call button and the one time I actually wanted water for my 1 year old I was asked "What is the problem here, is there a problem. Meanwhile the girl next to us who was sleeping put her elbow on to the same arm rest and turned on the light by accident right into our faces, 500 watts it felt like for 11 hours. The staff were definitely sent here as some kind of punishment, they hated their jobs, each other, the passengers and most of all themselves. The plane was so dirty I have no words for it, the magazines looked like dogs had taken a bite out of them, the floors and the seats were full of crumbs and the bathroom, my goodness had ash trays for the ancient days when you could smoke. $1450 per tickets, no alcoholic beverages. The cookies were ok. Overall horrible flight, for the price and the distance its actually disgusting.

### "bare-bones service"
In 2016, Air Canada assigned the Bogota to Toronto route to Air Canada Rouge. This means bare-bones service. From no seatback inflight entertainment for a 6 hour flight to smaller seats. My biggest complaint is that this flight has never been on time for me, making connections in YYZ almost impossible to make. In this flight in July, the flight was almost 45 minutes late landing and most of the people missed their connecting flights having to sleep in Toronto. That is no minor disruption. On the plus side, you get some decent food and the crew is younger than the typical Air Canada crew, so they seem to be enjoying their work.

### "surly and not professional"
One of the worst flights ever flying from Prague to Toronto! It started with the cattle call for boarding. No organization! We were informed that if we wanted to watch movies, etc., we needed to download the AC app. Really? The captain could not find smooth air for 9.5 hours. The flight attendants looked like they just got out of bed and came to the plane. They were surly and not professional. One flight attendant in particular was flippant with his responses to me. When I asked why we were being charged for alcohol on an international flight he said, "You should have flown Air Canada". I said I thought we were flying Air Canada, and his response was, "you're flying the no frills Rouge". As far as food goes, it was awful! The best item was the package of cookies.

### "Outstanding inflight crew"
Toronto to Berlin. Flight AC 1966 on the 20th of July left on time and arrived earlier. Seat comfort could have been significantly improved by increasing the recline even marginally. Outstanding inflight crew for the Premium Economy cabin: they were enthusiastic and gave you the impression that they were proud to work on this flight in their position. Their behaviour should and could serve as an example as to how flight attendants can make passengers feel welcome and well taken care off.

### "seats were far from each other"
Ottawa to Fort Lauderdale via Toronto. This is my 2nd time flying Air Canada and my 2nd time experience subpar customer service. Air Canada employees seem to have little joy in working with the company shows their minimal interest in ensuring their passengers have comfortable flying experience. Upon check-in in Ottawa, I was given a boarding pass with no gate number. As someone who had a connecting flight, I had little time to waste to play a guessing game to figure out which direction to go to find the correct gate. I stopped to ask at one of the desk and got the gate information, but that cost me time that was unnecessary. At check-in , I wasn't asked about seating preference. When traveling with family members, without having to ask, we are usually seated in close proximity. I didn't realize, until I got to the gate that the Air Canada rep. had given me and my father (with whom I was traveling) seats that were far from each other. Both times I've traveled with Air Canada, I felt like someone who was given free passes to fly rather than a paying customer.

### "very pleased with this flight"
I made the trip with my parents. And we were very pleased with this flight from Casablanca to Montreal. Everything went smoothly, and the staff were very helpful both at the airport and during the flight. My parents had special needs and they were well taken care of during this flight. | [FR] J'ai fait le voyage avec mes parents. et nous étions très satisfaits de ce vol de Casablanca vers Montréal. Tout s'est bien passé, et le personnel était bien serviable aussi bien au niveau de l'aeroport que pendant le vol. Mes parents avaient des besoins spéciaux et ils étaient bien pris en charge durant ce vol.

### "It was an okay flight"
Fort Myers to Toronto Pearson. It was an okay flight. There was a small medical problem onboard but it was resolved. the Air Canada Rouge Staff are very polite to their customers, but seats are very tight, not lots of legroom.

### "attentive flight attendants"
Toronto to London Gatwick. It made a big difference flying premium economy as the seats were wider with more leg room. Excellent service by very attentive flight attendants. iPads for entertainment and full beverage service plus a very tasty meal and snack. Also I much prefer Gatwick Airport to Heathrow. It was great to have our suitcases ready and waiting on the carousel, and would definitely fly Rouge premium again!

### "surprised at how small the overhead bins were"
Before this month, I last flew Air Canada rouge in economy just when it was replacing Air Canada for flights between Las Vegas and Canada and I was very put out that they refused to let me take my carry-on which although 23" I had successfully carried on every other airline I ever flew. This month I got United Super Saver awards for my wife and I to fly to Toronto from Las Vegas in their business class and we paid for business class tickets on the return flight. As a business class passenger I was allowed to carry on my 23" carry-on. I was, however, surprised at how small the overhead bins were. Both my carry-on and my wife's smaller carry-on could only fit in the bins with the long dimension of the bag going from front to back of the plane. Seats were standard domestic first class seats. The entertainment system, a free loan of an iPad with certain loaded movies was poor: There weren't many movies and their were mandatory commercials before each started. I consider this entertainment system useless. Both flights were dinner flights and I was surprised at how good the food tasted. I though the wines served with dinner were quite good. They did a nice job with seasoning and flavoring of rather ordinary foods. The FAs were attentive thru the meal service. After that they drew the curtains separating themselves from the front cabin passengers giving themselves some privacy to eat between the front cabin and the flight deck. Of course, passengers walked thru to use the lav and the FAs were very accommodating if the passengers asked for anything but they didn't circulate much or at all after the dinner service. One big plus for Air Canada rouge over American airlines is that the business class ticket (really domestic first) gains the passenger access to the Maple Leaf lounge which, seemed better than the United lounges to which domestic first class passengers are not given access.

### "Very tight seats"
Montreal to Algiers, the worst flight I had. I thought it was Air Canada, but huge differnce between the two. Very tight seats, not enough food, very poor service and  no personal tv - you have to take your own tablet or rent onboard the flight. I did not expect that when I paid. the first and last time ever with them and do not recommand it to any one unless you want to punish someone

### "far beyond uncomfortable"
Toronto to Victoria. Seating density on this flight far beyond uncomfortable to the point of being both unhealthy due to seat size and almost zero legroom to dangerous in case of emergency due to smallest aisle width I've ever seen. I'm 5'10, 180 lbs and felt crushed. Fetid air, sauna like conditions and indifferent attendants (only interest in selling booze and Ipad rentals). Several seniors around me were experiencing difficulties ranging from GI pains, through leg cramps to respitory discomfort and general anxiety. Trying to reach the toilets was brutal for those traversing the aisle and equally discomforted aisle seat occupants who were constantly jostled. Thank god for the co-operative and polite nature of most Canadians! Air Canada rouge  should issue a caution alerting passengers to the increased density seating (about 20 more seats than normal, and the new normal is tight to begin with). Been travelling by air for 50 years and this ranks in my worst 5.

### "staff was absolutely amazing"
Athens to Montreal on 4th July. The staff on the plane was absolutely amazing. A flight attendant on flight AC1903 was so helpful and made the 10 hour flight much better and very helpful. It was unfortunate that there are no tvs and no iPads to rent out but we know for next time to bring our own. Great service.

### "food in Economy become inedible"
Toronto to Rome. I consistently find Air Canada safe, efficient, and hassle-free, and the staff helpful and courteous at every airport. Sometimes line ups can be long but that has never compromised making my flight. I have only had a problem once when my luggage did not arrive, but that was due to a major problem at the airport where I had to transfer; the baggage rails had shut down and they couldn't get my bag onto my connecting flight in time. The bag arrived at my doorstep as promised two days later. When they introduced the Zoned boarding I found at first that staff were terribly militant to the point of rudeness in enforcing the zones but that has improved substantially. The on-board entertainment is excellent and they have charging ports on the back of every seat. I have never had trouble finding space for my overhead luggage. I do wish that all seats had neck rests that are pliable and that there was a physical division between seats. My one complaint is that the food in Economy has become inedible. I had occasion to fly Premium Economy on a flight to Tel Aviv and the food was excellent; on my return in Economy it was the same inedible dreck as has been on offer for about a year now; obviously edible food makes it on board but they are really cutting back for those in Economy. I used to defend AC food because it was really not bad, but I can't anymore, they really should do better in this department. The beverages are great - large selection of soft drinks, beer, wine, juice, coffee, tea. When evaluating AC I think it is important to keep in mind that it services a country that is the second largest in the world geographically, with all the highly variant weather across the country and we experience changes in temperature of 60+ degrees across the seasons, yet has a population of only 33 million. But they need to do better with the food in Economy. It may be that the vegetarian/Kosher/Halal etc. options are better than the standard fare; I am going to try that next time.

### "seat did not recline at all"
New York to Edinburgh via Toronto. This was the first time we had flown with Rouge and it will be the last. The first stage of our journey from La Guardia to Toronto was fine, what you would expect from a budget airline. Our almost 7 hour flight from Toronto to Edinburgh however was a different story. We boarded and found that our seats backed on to the toilets and did not recline at all. This was an overnight flight and our nephew travelling with us is 6 ft 2inches tall! Flight was full so no chance of changing seats. We then started to look for the in flight entertainment to find there was none! I checked their magazine to find that if you wanted any entertainment, you had to rent and i-pad from them costing $10 per person or download their app. Not having a tablet with us, I asked the attendant if we could rent these to be told that they are only given a very limited amount and they had none left. We were only a few minutes into the flight! Why on earth would you advertise something you cannot supply? The plane had I am guessing over 200 people on board and I did not see a single person in our cabin renting an i-pad! So there we were, nearly 7 hours of listening to the toilet door banging and toilets flushing all night, asked the attendant about reclining seats to be told that these seats have a 'limited' recline. They were limited all right, they did not move at all! Found the staff to be ok other than one who was curt to the point of rude. We have flown extensively and have never ever had a transatlantic flight with no entertainment available. Terrible airline, I would rather pay more and fly with a company who have a bit of regard for their passengers!

### "so disappointed"
I chose to fly with Air Canada rouge because I have used Air Canada in the past and they have always been great. When we boarded the plane from Toronto to Las Vegas we were surprised that there were no TVs and no map indicating our route. Our seats were full of crumbs and garbage and when my boyfriend pulled down his tray table there was chewed gum inside but we ignored all of this because we were looking forward to our trip. When we arrived at check-in at Las Vegas Airport when we were headed back home we discovered our seats had been split up and we were no longer sitting together. I began to panic as I have extreme fear of flying. The man of the check-in didn't show any empathy or try in any way to fix the problem. When we boarded the plane we realized my boyfriend was in business class and I was by the emergency exit in economy. We didn't ask for these seats all we wanted was to be together. We would have been happy to be an economy sitting beside each other. We tried desperately to get the people next to us to switch seats but they both wouldn't budge. No one did anything and I was forced to sit beside an emergency exit right in front of the bathrooms on a red-eye flight where people were coming in and out constantly. The man sitting beside me tried to tell me that he paid more for that seat but I don't understand why anybody would pay more to sit in what I found to be the most uncomfortable spot of the plane. In addition to this my boyfriend was freezing on the plane and he was told that there were no more blankets left for him. We work hard for our money and when we spend the amount of money that we did on this flight we have a certain standard that we expect to be met. I have always trusted Air Canada but now they have completely let me down. I don't think I will ever use this airline again I am so disappointed.

### "missed the IFE screens"
Athens to Montreal. I missed the IFE screens on the back of the seat, not only for entertainment, but also for the route map. While entertainment is available on one's own devices, it wasn't consistent or easy to hook up and I didn't want to pay the ten dollars for the Ipad because the movie selection was not as good as what I had been offered on my domestic flight. When I last flew to Europe, on British airways, passengers were offered free wine. Why not on Air Canada Rouge? I will say that the seats were comfortable, and, most importantly, the flight was smooth and on time. I did miss the economy service I had become used to, though. I would not recommend this airline.

### "experience was simply painful"
Toronto to Tampa on AC Rouge. Check in was painless using the priority lane. Boarding was by zone number and somewhat orderly. On board the interior was new and fresh. The single biggest issues is how tightly the seats are packed. We had preselected emergency exit row which made a huge difference. Otherwise, I cannot see how anyone can travel long distances in such cramped quarters. The crew were friendly and professional. The FA serving us was on her third day on the job but performed as if she had been doing it for decades. There is no inflight service to speak of other than snacks for purchase and non alcoholic drinks. The IFE which is streamed over your personal device was simply abysmal with dated movies and very narrow selection. Flight left and arrived on time. AC Rouge is meant to be a low cost version of the mainline carrier but in fact it is not. Aside from the pleasant crew the on board experience was simply painful.

### "This should never happen"
Air Canada vacation from Ottawa to Jamaica via Toronto return, flights delayed both ways, bags lost. Services for disabled all but discontinued. I am 67, forced to go without a wheelchair and run/hobble between gates at times while being admonished for not running faster. My 69 year old wife forced to pick up our bags, take me, her and the bags through customs, take the bags, me and the wheelchair to a baggage drop area, deposit the bags herself, run to the next gate pushing the wheelchair only to have our wheelchair confiscated. This should never happen.

### "impossible to sit in those seats"
Miami to Toronto. The worst of the worst airlines out there. I stand 6'3" and we specifically asked for emergency exit seats. That is not what I got when we boarded. It was almost impossible for me to sit in those seats. I will never again fly this sardine can in the sky. My advise to anyone looking to fly Air Canada Rouge,look elsewhere.

### "very unpleasant experience"
Nassau to Toronto. I had a very unpleasant experience with Air Canada rouge. On my way back to Canada after a delightful vacation in Nassau, Bahamas, our flight (AC1817) was delayed by 35 minutes which ended up being 1 hour late. This delay resulted in missing my connecting flight from Toronto to Montreal. I was very disappointed by the poor customer service. When we landed in Toronto at 11:52 pm, I was told by a flight attendant that it was likely that our plane departing at 12:30 am would wait for us as we were 15 passagers heading to Montreal or Ottawa. I ran to the baggage carrousel and was then told at 12:15 am by an Air Canada representative that our flight to Montreal was waiting for us. At 12:23 am, the same rep confirmed that the plane was leaving without us. I was then redirected to a customer service office were they gave me and my sister a $20 food coupon to eat at the airport. As the flight that we missed was the last one of the night, I ended up sleeping on the floor at Pearson's airport until 6:00 am (boarding time of my next flight). I booked my vacations through Air Canada and it was not cheap. I was expecting a great customer service. The entertainment 'app' wasn't working on our way to Nassau. Very displeased with my whole experience.

### "very good experience"
We flew from Vancouver thru Toronto to Barbados with Air Canada rouge. All of the staff was friendly, professional and courteous. Remember that you are flying on a discount airline so seating is tighter and not as comfortable. You will offset price for comfort. The flights were on time and we can not complain. If you want meals and better leg room then you need to pay more for a different flight. I felt that we were treated well and got good value for the money. On the return trip the counter staff moved us to a flight with less of a layover for no charge. I chatted with the captain for a few minutes while boarding. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. Very good experience.

### "like to point out my discontent"
Epic flights and unacceptable lack of information. Montreal to Nassau via Toronto after being advised by e-mail of a possible delay in flights to Toronto, I was able to anticipate and change my Montreal-Toronto flight for another departing 5 hours earlier. It caused me long hours of waiting in Toronto but at least I could have my transfer to Nassau. Return no email notification of possible delays. Yet the Air Canada AC 1817 flight from Nassau to Toronto takes off 40 minutes late. Arriving 40 minutes late in Toronto, passengers in transit to Montreal were advised that the Toronto-Montreal AC 7564 flight will wait for them, but they must rush to retrieve their bags and return to customs. The suitcases took a little time to arrive but finally, after having recovered them, we were advised that the plane actually had left, without us! It was the last flight for Montreal, the next flight leaving the next morning. Given the late hour (1am when I was rebooked), it was of course impossible to get a room at any hotel to return a few hours later at the airport. So we had to spend the night at the airport and leave the next morning, which caused me a lot of inconveniences. If a delay could be acceptable, it would have been appropriate to notify passengers by e-mail as they did in the first place, in order to allow us to make arrangements. Moreover, it is unacceptable to tell us that the flight will wait for us to tell us 10mn later, after we crossed the airport running with our suitcases, that it actually left without us! This is not the first time that I have been directly affected by Air Canada's deplorable service and I would like to point out my discontent with traveling with you.

### "was a very pleasant experience"
Montreal to Casablanca. Was expecting a pretty basic experience from the reviews, but it was a very pleasant experience. All the flight attendants were super friendly and accommodating, unlike some other North American carriers. We opted for the 'Preferred Seating', which gave us 34 inches of legroom. The seats were decently comfortable. There were no in flight entertainment screens built into the back of the seats though. You have to download their Air Canada app to watch streaming entertainment on your tablet/mobile. The overhead bins in the 767's were super tiny though. About as small as the bins in a regional jet. Food was average - but serviceable. Would totally fly with them again especially to Morocco since there is a laptop ban from flights from Morocco directly to the USA!

### "definitely travel Rouge again"
I am surprised to see a low overall score here. I was pleasantly surprised with this airline. We travelled Toronto to Cancun return for our wedding and the staff was good (better on the way there than the way back), the seats were slightly wider than other airlines I've flown economy in. Leg room was far better as well. The food was good and the staff gave us free wine on the way down because it was our wedding. I would definitely travel Rouge again.

### "one of the worst flights"
Mexico City to Toronto. This is the first time I have been on an Air Canada Rouge flight. I had a round trip from Toronto to Mexico City and it was a terrible downgrade from previous Air Canada service to Mexico City. Air Canada no longer allows 1 free check bag for economy class. This is promoted as an offer to reduce flight cost, even there is no way of making a comparison on price when it is in constant fluctuation, and I definitely paid the same as I have in the past of economy Air Canada price that use to include 1 check bag (and previously a meal as well). The cost of a flight with baggage included was nearly $350 dollars more! The rouge flight only provides online entertainment that you must use you table, smartphone or laptop, but provides no plug in to charge your device, my laptop ran out after about 2 hours on the flight. This would be a further problem if you are arriving somewhere and need to communicate but have no battery left on your phone! Air Canada overbooked flight. There were numerous passengers that paid and booked flight but could not board because the flight was show to be overbooked. If you do not check-in online or pay for a seat selection, you are not guaranteed a seat. As a result I had to wait until 10 minutes before boarding so I could have a seat confirmation, which turned out to be in the back row by the washrooms. I was seated with two other large men. Flight attendants were rude and hit my knee and elbow about 3 times moving their food cart through the aisle -  maybe it was my fault because my knee was tilted the wrong way, but they also knew the three large men stuck in one aisle were very uncomfortably squished into their row. Was one of the worst flights I have taken. I will definitely be changing my preference of giving them my business at the first opportunity.

### "did the job but with a smile"
Toronto to Puerto Vallarta. I'm very spoiled, I get to mostly fly up front when I fly but Rouge was the option and it was a one stop through Toronto so I took it. I'd heard horror stories, so I booked the aisle exit row and hoped for the best. I was really pleasantly surprised. Now it was one of the brand new Airbus 321's that Rouge have bought but there was so much room in my exit row seat that the guy in the window seat (nobody between) could walk right around me. The big thing was the crew who were young, had a sense of humour and did the job but with a smile. What a difference from regular Air Canada these days. I would take these guys again, not sure how bad it would be on a 767 but on these new 321's yes absolutely. The entertainment through the wifi on my phone was awesome and I bought something to eat in the terminal and took it onboard. Whatever. The flight was on time, it's Air Canada and I thought it was pretty good.

### "What you've heard is true"
Flew Air Canada Rouge from Montreal to Dublin. Never again. What you've heard is true. Rouge is just awful. Seats that left me aching for 2 days, inedible food, and a new low in overnight travel - a seeming unwillingness to dim cabin lights. Attendants were downright cranky, and the plane was just plain filthy. Inflight wifi was problematic. Never ever again. I'll take a stop over, pay more, and pass on miles before flying Rouge. Air Canada, this is just an embarassment.

### "seating was horrendous"
Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Calgary then changed planes still Rouge on to Phoenix. When I booked possibly I was naïve, the price was excellent, the best of several airlines for the days I wanted to fly, when I saw Air Canada Rouge I assumed my flights would be Air Canada quality I couldn't have been more wrong. First the good, the aircraft were clean, the flight attendants excellent, my flights on time. Now the bad, seating was horrendous and that's taking into account flying charter airlines like Sunwing and Transat, all flights were full so the planes packed. I ordered a chicken wrap snack, $8.95 not expecting much and that's what I got a couple of scraps of chicken with some lettuce, a complete waste.

### "on time and functional"
We used Air Canada rouge as a connection from Toronto to Cancun flying from London. The outwards journey was ok. The plane was a little scruffy and dirty but it was on time and functional. However the return journey is proving to be much worse. There is a 7 hour delay - no explanation given yet. They have checked us in but not confirmed our new connections to London as we will miss our scheduled connection. They blame Air Canada for this as they are not Air Canada. We joined the queue at 8.30 and at 11.30 are checked in and being bussed to a hotel to wait to be called. Delays happen but the lack of information and consideration for onward connections is very poor.

### "we were pleasantly surprised"
We were scheduled to return to Canada from Mexico on Sat 8th Apr on Air Canada Business Class (using our hard earned points) and were upset to learn that our scheduled flight had been cancelled and we were having to return a day earlier than planned and also on Air Canada Rouge - an unknown entity at that point. However, we were pleasantly surprised as our experience was wonderful. Special mention to all the crew and flight attendants who worked diligently taking care of all passengers.

### "paid upgrade to premium economy"
Flying to BOG from YYC via YYZ. Gambled and did a paid upgrade to premium economy. At the boarding gate, the zone and priority boarding not followed. It was a mad rush to get people in the plane. Boeing 767-300 interior looks aged, seats not comfortable, and little overhead space. People flighting like Spartacus to get their carry on to the overhead bins. My seat won't recline all the way. Breakfast, looked great how presented, but was too little and average. The plane is extremely cold during the flight. Flight attendants are young and attractive, but worked on a stopwatch for their rounds.

### "happily travel this way again"
Dublin to Toronto with onward connection to Palm Springs, March 2017. I have been using Air Canada rouge since they started flying in 2013. These being the 11th and 12th sectors flown all using the premium rouge (PR) product. Check in at DUB was fine with no line at the premium desk. The desk agent advised us to take the fast-track security line, I was not expecting this, so that made a good start to the trip. Onboard the Boeing 767-300, we were offered the usual water or orange juice prior to departure along with newspapers, Canadian and Irish. Orders for the rouge I-pads (IFE system) were taken, and later the lunch order with the usual choice of main course. Once in the air plus 30 minutes or so drinks were served this followed by lunch with more drinks on offer. One minor change from previous rouge flights was that no linen table cloth was provided for the tray table. The drinks service however was much better than previously experienced, the FA in charge of the premium cabin was very proactive in anticipating passenger’s requirement. Later in the flight, prior to arrival at Toronto, a light wrap (vegetarian or chicken) was offered along with more drinks. The great service from the FA in charge made the flight pass very quickly. The following morning, we continued from Toronto to Palm Springs. Being ticketed in premium economy for the DUB/YYZ sector this translated into business class for the cross-border flight from YYZ to PSP, as a result we had Maple Leaf Lounge access at YYZ. The flight boarding of the A319 aircraft was done promptly. It was a completely full flight in both sections. In common with all other premium rouge flights, water or orange juice were offered prior to departure along with the breakfast order being taken and the rouge I-pads. The breakfast offered was similar to that on main-line AC within North America, I really was not expecting it to be any different! Again, no linen table cloth for the tray table? – It looks like this minor nicety has been withdrawn. An additional snack and drinks were offered prior to landing in PSP. This was a long flight in a A319, extended slightly by weather conditions en-route. Like the DUB/YYZ flight the FA looking after us was very friendly and efficient at her job. We chose this routing from Europe to California as it was competitively priced for premium economy using DUB as a departure point, and would happily travel this way again. If anyone from Air Canada rouge reads these reports an EDI departure would have been even better!

### "I truly enjoyed my flight"
I truly enjoyed my flight from Toronto to San Diego, Cal. The flight was #1887 on March 28th, 2017. The plane was nice and clean and the flight was extremely smooth. However, what made it extremely pleasant was the lead flight attendant. She made announcements in English and impeccable French. She was tender and extremely helpful. She truly made my day with her bright smile and helpful attitude. She noticed that my head was not comfortable, so without my asking, she brought a pillow. Never seen that before.

### "hope just a one time occurrence"
❎ Unverified |  Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Flew round trip and was impressed with the flight to Toronto from Fort Lauderdale. However, the return flight did not compare in cleanliness of the plane, nor the in flight service, nor the appearance of the Flight Attendants. I was seated in the back half of the plane, within the last 6 rows, and noticed the area and seats had not been cleaned before we boarded. The Flight attendants looked disheveled, hair messy, clothes wrinkled, tired, and did not smile. As I had an aisle seat, one of the attendants kept bumping into me, without apology, everytime she went up and down the aisles. During the flight a beverage service was offered to the passengers, but not all passengers. The passengers in the back of the plane were not offered any beverage with no explanation as to why! I was quite unhappy with this lack of customer service. It was with great reluctance that I booked my December trip with Canada rouge. I sincerely hope this was just a one time occurrence!

### "avoid a long overseas flight"
On 18 March I flew from Edmonton to Orlando via Montreal aboard Air Canada 192/1872. We boarded a Boeing 767-300ER in Montreal, and I was delayed almost two hours due to what I assume was a mechanical issue, similar to what I experienced last August. At least the plane left this time around, but I missed my pre-arranged shuttle connections in Orlando extending an already long travel day, finally arriving at my destination well after 0200 EDT, which is not a pleasant way to start a vacation. I realize Air Canada is re equipping with the 787, but I do not get the gist of repurposing these well used 767-300s to Rouge if their condition reflects poorly upon the brand, which has taken a hit with the cramped seating and reduction in cabin services. One has to wonder if they have plans to replace the older Rouge aircraft. I might add the return flight was via Toronto was on a much newer aircraft ex Hawaiian with an more up to date interior to boot, which left on time. I might consider Rouge again for a short North American jaunt, but would avoid a long overseas flight on apparently old and past their prime aircraft, especially given the comfort levels in Economy. I was fortunate to be in their watered down Business Class upfront on all my flights. These flights represented good value at least on paper, but there are more reliable alternatives out there than an old 767. Flights to Orlando on United via Houston were half the cost of Rouge right up to departure.

### "I was not impressed"
I would not recommend Air Canada and will not travel with them again. I paid extra for preferred seating and I did get extra room (that's the good news). However, I couldn't connect to the entertainment while flying on my ipad or phone even though I had the Air Canada app? The seating area had not been cleaned from the previous flight and there were crumbs everywhere. They ran out of food (on a full flight to Maui?) They asked passengers to check in their carry on luggage because they didn't have room for it. I didn't have anywhere to put my carry on luggage even though I paid the extra money for the preferred seating (common sense would say if you pay extra for something you should have preference to the above head compartment). Instead, the people behind me who didn't pay anything extra got my compartment. When I asked the airline attendant where I should put it she was of no assistance and told me I was on my own to find room. I guess I'm more familiar with the plane's storage space than the actual Air Canada employee. For a 6 hour plane ride I was not impressed. Will try another airline next time.

### "flight was bad even for Air Canada"
Toronto to Fort Lauderdale on 13th March. This flight was bad even for Air Canada. The staff was rude at best, insulting at times and never helpful. We had a 6.40 am flight and were early but eventually were told to board the plane, then told to disembark, then told to reload, then again told to disembark, all by different staff. Evidently communications skills are not a hiring requirement. We were then given some lame excuse about having to use an alternate fueling process which delayed the departure by 3 hours in total. Why this has to be done in the first place is scary and why the problem wasn't detected earlier to minimize the delay reeks of incompetence. After 2 hours they finally loaded us, told us we were fuelled and then delayed the departure for an hour for no specified reason (I suspect we were loaded to shut us up). The result of this was we would miss connecting flights and when we asked how this would be resolved we were told not to worry, an Air Canada customer service representative would meet us at the gate and get things settled and that we would not have a problem. This was either a lie or at best a complete lack of communications as this did not happen, either way unacceptable. On landing we had to track down the Air Canada booth, get a piece of paper to then take to the connecting airline where we found out that we missed out on several flights and that the 4 pm was booked solid. We were given the option of the 8 pm flight or wait until the next day. Since this was March break and we were on a 5 day vacation I didn't think spending it in the airport was a great option so we chose the 8 pm flight. What irked me was that every time we asked a question we were given erroneous (trying to be positive) answers at best. We were advised we could contact customer service which we did who then said all they could do was call in the Manager who we had already discussed this with so no comfort there. We were then advised to contact customer relations. When we did that were told they didn't talk to people and hung up on us when we tried to come up with alternative travel arrangements to avoid having to wait until 8 pm. I think that unless there is an alternative to Air Canada that my future travel plans involve driving, at least I have some control. Everyone else should consider that as well.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Toronto to Las Vegas. It was not as bad as I thought it would be. Their business class product is not like Air Canada's business class but it had almost the same style of food menu and drinks are served in glass. They had two red wine selections to choose from. Other than the ice cream and fresh baked cookies that you would receive on a long haul west coast flight with Air Canada business class this product was not that bad. Service was outstanding on both legs of this trip from YYZ-LAS and return on the red eye from LAS-YYZ. Only exception and difference is the seat on the B767-300 business class on rouge is not a sleeper pod seat like you would have found on Air Canada business class. Also note that the name for business class on Air Canada Rouge is Premium Rouge.

### "found the seats adequate"
Flew Air Canada rouge from Las Vegas to Calgary. Excellent service from the Montreal based cabin crew. Flew economy but purchased meal at time of booking. Served a meal from business class along with a warm fresh bread roll. Watched a movie on my Samsung Tablet via streaming player service of the airline. I am 5'10" and found the seats adequate. I would fly with them again for certain.

### "had to sit with my knees apart"
I have never flown Rouge even though I have flown Air Canada forever. Unfortunately, I was not prepared for what I had to look forward to. Flew from Toronto to Fort Myers. I stand 6'3" and, literally, could not sit with my legs in front of me. I was incredulous! I looked around to see if I was in a narrow row but soon found another tall guy who had the same look on his face. For three hours I had to sit with my knees apart and I still couldn't sit without my knees touching the seat in front of me. I had to fight off some cramping along the way as well. The seats are equally as bad. It may have been more bearable if I could at least move around a little to shift my weight around but because I was wedged in I could barely move. I wrote Air Canada to describe my experience in a bit more detail but more importantly to remind them why I am now flying with one of their competitors.

### "crew were friendly and helpful"
Copenhagen to Varadero via Toronto. Before flying Air Canada Rouge for the first time in February 2017, I read horrific reports on the airline's poor service. I am European an accustomed to European standard for low price airlines, and I really cannot find very much to criticize. You get what you pay for. My wife and I had a nice flight, on time, from Toronto to Varadero and back three weeks later. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful and the pilots very informative. The only thing that should be mentioned is the space between the seats. Annother 2 inches will make a difference.

### "worst flight I've been on"
Flew Air Canada rouge from Las Vegas to Toronto. Worst flight I've been on, both ways were awful but the way back was particularly bad. No inflight entertainment unless you want to pay $10.00 for an iPad? No working wifi, no working outlet to charge your phone and the staff on the way back were the rudest flight attendants I've had. I realize that it being a night flight might mean less attentive staff but even while me and my friend paged them, trying multiple times for several minutes to get a glass of water. They didn't come. We finally flagged someone down and even said we would buy a drink and they said 'no it's not out front. Even with other guests they were very short and rude.

### "complaint was inflight entertainment"
Tampa to Toronto. First trip on Air Canada Rouge. Only real complaint was the inflight entertainment and the wifi. Even though I had the AC app on my Android phone, when I went to log in, it said I still needed to download another app to watch movies, etc. Apparently this is only with Android phones and there's a "how to" guide on the AC app. Why they don't tell you to do this before your flight, or have it included in the main App like they do with the Apple app, I have no idea. So, I had to spend the first 15 minutes of my flight trying to download this app on the plane's slow wifi and then figure out how to install it, because it doesn't install itself. Then, finally when i got it to work, I got to enjoy the third rate entertainment -  what a terrible selection. Good luck to anyone who flies more than once a year to find anything they want to watch.

### "last Rouge flight I will be taking"
Miami to Toronto. This is the last Rouge flight I will be taking. Unfortunately, as Air Canada expands its Rouge line and destinations this will likely mean simply switching airlines for many flights. Although flying Air Canada has never been cheap, one of the things they always had going for them was that the leg room and comfort of the economy cabin was a step above many US and European airlines. Not so with Rouge! This is the most cramped cabin I have travelled in. 3+ hours of having my legs firmly pressed into the seat in front of me is uncomfortable and unacceptable. Rouge was a big mistake for Air Canada. This is Air Canada's 80th year of service and they are trying to expand their international presence.

### "uncomfortable penny-pinching seats"
Toronto to Fort Myers. I travel a lot, both domestically and internationally. I have been on my fair share of planes - all shapes and sizes and ages, but never in my life have I been subjected to such uncomfortable penny-pinching seats as Air Canada Rouge. When teenage girls are behind you and can't be more than 5'7" and are complaining about the severe lack of leg and elbow room, a man like myself at 6'3" is in big trouble. The seats literally do not fit you if you are over 6-feet and barely fit an average person. They are narrow, the seats don't move and myself and a gentlemen across the row (around 6-feet) were limping off the plane having been treated to 3 hours of knees jammed into a too-small space and no ability to put your legs under or at an angle. It is not hyperbole, it is that bad. I'm already fearing my trip back. The profit motive of Air Canada is sickening seeing what they have done to these planes. I will do whatever it takes to avoid Air Canada rouge at all costs in the future. I will pay more for a competitor or gladly connect - seriously, you shouldn't be limping after a flight and cramping up during it at these prices.

### "not a very nice experience"
Saint Kitts to Toronto. Flight was perfectly on time, no complaints! Seats in economy class were unworthy of discussion and for a 5h flight no leg room, too narrow and back rests not movable. Flight attendants with routined friendliness and no smile, asked questions in military order tone, didn't even look at customers when they handed over drinks! Inflight entertainment was not exciting, but okay. In total not a very nice experience.

### "not fly this airline again"
Chicago to Budapest via Toronto and the worst airline I have flown. Left Chicago to Toronto Pearson 45 minutes late and then 1 hr late departing to Budapest. Limited leg room on plane. On the return we departed from Budapest 4 hours late, and by the time we got to Pearson Toronto, all flights to Chicago were gone. They put us in a hotel till next morning and gave us money to buy a half a dinner. In Budapest they gave us money for a coffee.I will not fly this airline again. George Racher

### "I was denied my primary meal choice"
Flew Air Canada rouge from Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. I booked and paid for a return air fare to Fort Lauderdale in business class, namely Premium Rouge back in August 2016 for flights Jan 13-Jan 22 when the cabins availability was wide open. On both the outbound an the inbound I was denied my primary meal choice which I find unacceptable. The outbound was half-full so there was no reason not to have sufficient choices. Shouldn’t the airline make sure that enough meals are on board for their premium passengers seeing they only offer two choices? Shouldn’t meal choices be assigned at least by order of booking? Also watching a film on the provided iPad proved to be an excercise in frustration as right in the middle of the film the movie froze. The attendant told me that she had already notified the company of this glitch but as of yet it had not been fixed. No wonder the Rouge entertainment system is considered a joke. As I shall be returning to Florida in March I shall book with Westjet as I find Air Canada’s service is deteriorating more and more and just not worth the money one has to pay for vile inferior service like that of Rouge.

### "no entertainment unless download app"
Manchester to Toronto in August 2016. A dirty plane, rude staff and no entertainment unless you had downloaded their app, or paid as we did $10 each for 2 ipads. Cancelled flight but offered us another one same say with a stopover, so we chose the next day as we had booked a direct flight and wanted a direct flight. Lost a nights accommodation with no refund. We have flown with budget airlines and never been treated or spoken to like this crew did. They offered us 30% discount off further tickets, but we would need buy accommodation etc and this has to be used by this August and no way could we afford to go this year.

### "attentive, friendly and professional"
Used Aeroplan points for 4 in Premium Rouge from Toronto to Honolulu. The 767 was actually recently transferred from "mainline" to Rouge so was quite new in the sense that it had been completely redone inside so was very fresh. The cabin staff was really great, attentive, friendly and professional. Flight was 9+ hours and 2 meals were served. Food was ok, not much different than an Air Canada domestic exec class flight. FA's came through on a regular basis to offer water. Seats are ok as well, slightly larger and more legroom but obviously not a true business class or lie flat seat. Ipads in Premium Rouge have additional content but bring your own stuff if you really want to be sure you'll have something to watch. I have little patience for people who complain about not knowing their filght is on Rouge when they book it as Air Canada is extremely clear about it when booking and certainly on the ticket. Yes the seats are close together, you have to pay for everything, you need to bring your own ipad and connect to their app before takeoff, but it's all very clear upfront. If you don't like it and didn't pay less than a competitor then book with another airline and take a connecting flight - Rouge will still likely save you a connection. Set your expectations ahead of time and you will be pleasantly surprised.

### "ruined the first day of our vacation"
We were scheduled to fly Air Canada Rouge on December 26, 2016 from Toronto to Varadero, Cuba. The flight was to depart at 0800. This flight was delayed until 1050 because there wasn't a pilot to fly the plane. We boarded the plane at 1015 and sat on the plane for about an hour. There was a maintenance problem with this plane that was discovered as it flew into Toronto. We had to get off of the plane and return to the terminal while they got a different plane. We boarded this different plane at 1230. They then had to rearrange the passenger seating to balance the plane, due to the fact that this was a larger plane. We eventually left Toronto at 1355 instead of 0800. These delays caused us to arrive at our hotel in Varadero at 2030 instead of 1430 which ruined the first day of our vacation. The only compensation that Air Canada provided us was that we could use our boarding passes towards a $15 food purchase during the delay. Considering airport prices, I couldn't get a salad and a pop for $15.

### "not exactly cut rate prices"
Seats were too close, leaving my knees jammed into seat in front. No policing of carry-ons, so boarding time was 45 minutes. Departure from Fort Myers to Toronto was 3h 40 m late, due to an issue with the plane in Havana 14 hours prior. Would not even food voucher when asked: the policy is 4 hour delay. Staff just shrugged their shoulders. A similar situation 8 days earlier on the Toronto to Fort Myers leg, 4 hours late in departing. Blamed weather, a battery change in Hamilton, staffing problems, etc. Worst is that no notice was given of delay. Paid $1000 Cdn round trip for each seat, so not exactly cut rate prices.

### "delay after delay"
Air Canada rouge just doesn't care. When we flew to Tampa the flight was 1.5 hours late with no explanation and no apology. Coming home we received 4 text messages of delay after delay. Didn't end up flying out until 1am and home at 5am. Booked certain times on purpose, not to fly red eyes. Again no explanation and no apology. My sister flew out today and her flight was delayed over 4 hours. They are never on time. The flight is always freezing and there is no leg room unless you pay extra. Never again.

### "seat pitch very tight, I could barely move"
Toronto to Fort Myers with Air Canada rouge. Seat pitch was 29 inches. I'm 5'10 and my knees were in the back of the seat in front of me. Very tight, I could barely move. And very poor services too. It supposed to be the low cost company for AC but the ticket was not cheap at all. So, I'll stay away from Air Canada Rouge for my next trips.

### "seat can barely fit a small person"
Toronto to Fort Myers. We fly Air Canada at least 6 times per year and now they started with this Air Canada rouge. Flight was delayed, boarding seems to be an issue. The seat can barely fit a small person let alone a 6ft 200lb person. Your legs are cramped in these tiny seats it is ridiculous. Attendants come by once for food or drinks and then were left with our garbage for the entire flight. They have wifi entertainment system that you must use your own device to watch, but no power outlets - they will rent you an Ipad for $10. They charge $25 per checked bag so of course many bring 2-3 carry-on which somehow they allow, then the bags don't fit under the seats.

### "utter shock at the service"
Flew Air Canada rouge from OGG to YVR. Worst flight and airline, cannot believe they are owned by the same company. If you are looking or your travel agent is suggesting, ask for alternatives. Seats are jammed so close, no recline on the seat to speak of and the service is terrible. Leaving Maui, they had the plane at 61 degrees then wanted $7 per blanket. My wife and kids were freezing, half the plane was asking for heat and they kept deferring to the captain. They never came around when the seat belt sign was off, only did when the sign was on and of course we they could not serve hot beverages when the seat belt sign was on. I have posted that this was a family trip but I have Air Canada Elite Status - thus my overall and utter shock at the service.

### "on time both ways"
Full flight on 25th Nov from HNL to YVR with Air Canada rouge was on time both ways. Flight attendants were both professional and helpful. Aircraft was clean. Seats 12 AC were great. Lots of leg room. Only criticism was the PA system. When pilots gave updates on flight the message was completely unheard due to static noise. We purchased snack for $7.00 each and got cashews and a beef sandwich. Sandwich not that great. Airline is recommended as a red eye flight. Inflight entertainment on APP was supplied however not much of a good selection. Ground crew were very good checked one carryon as being full flight saved on overhead storage on aircraft.

### "uncomfortable, unimpressed"
Toronto to Punta Cana. My husband and I were seated at the emergency exit section and the stewardess informed us, only when we flagged her down, that the seats did not recline and leg space was even tighter. Entertainment on board was the only thing that kept me sane. Marley documentary was great and long. On the same flight back, we got stuck in the same seats but this time, if we wanted to use the facilities, there was no running water. They had wet wipes in the sink for our use. Unpleasant, uncomfortable, unimpressed.

### "inhumane seats"
Inhumane seats. I fly constantly, maybe 50 flights a year. These are the worst seats I've ever "fit" in. I weigh about 210 and am 5' 11". I have shortish legs for my height. Still I can point my knees forward as they press into the seat in front of me. Every move the person makes in front of me, I feel. Now. I flew on points. So even with my Air Canada status they shoved me to the back of the plane (with my wife). They should be ashamed. My wife actually felt claustrophobic. Air Canada. Anything for a buck.

### "legroom was outstanding"
Manchester to Toronto with Air Canada rouge. We were given the chance to upgrade when we checked in online 24 hours prior. The check-in process was very simple and quick. The line at MAN for Economy Passengers was very long, however passengers travelling in Premium Rouge or those with a Star Alliance Gold (or equivalent) status were able to use the Premier Bag Drop. Bag drop was quick with friendly staff and we were invited to use the Priority Lane in security. We boarded early in Boarding Zone 2 and got into our seats. The bulkhead seats (row 1) lacked legroom, but row 2's legroom was outstanding. When we sat down, a bottle of water was waiting for us and we were given orange juice and a menu for later in the flight. Also, there was an Air Canada amenity kit for Premium passengers. The crew were friendly and they took our order for lunch - Chicken with feta or Pumpkin ravioli. I had the ravioli, it was amazing. In addition, Premium passengers can use a free iPad for inflight entertainment which has an extra app for newer releases. We departed on time and got into the air, where we were served drinks in glass. Alcohol is complimentary for Premium Passengers. The regular entertainment didn't have much choice, but Player Plus had many new releases. Our tray table was set out with linen for the meal, which had a Parmesan salad at the side and an apple tartlet for dessert. We were given stainless steel cutlery as well as other condiments. Once the meal was finished, the table was cleared and I could put my drink on the central unit. The seat featured an adjustable headrest, extensive legroom, an AC Power Unit, a reading lamp and a USB power unit. The seat was very comfortable and wide. Just prior to landing we were served a "Monty's bake house" wrap. It was supposed to be hot, but it wasn't. There was chicken or vegetable - but either way it was just all a mush. Monty's is an external company from the U.K. that services many airlines including American and Qantas. We landed into Toronto on time, taxied into the modern Terminal 1 and were given a friendly goodbye from all staff. Overall this was a great flight and I would definitely recommend it.

### "probably won't fly Rouge again"
Barcelona to Toronto. I had never flown Air Canada rouge before this. It is a very long flight without a screen. Sure you can rent a device, but it's not the same. The staff seem much friendlier than traditional AC staff, if not as experienced. The food is pure AC, very very mediocre. And we bought our own drinks, not too pricey, but not right. I paid for one of the extra leg room seats, it was OK, not as roomy as other aircraft, but OK. I probably won't fly Rouge again as part of the joy of crossing the pond is have some wine and watching bad movies.

### "very comfortable flight"
Calgary to Las Vegas. No complaints. This was a very comfortable flight with friendly attentive crew. I purchased the Cafe voucher in advance for CAD$7.00 and this turned out to be a bargain and a great idea. I could choose one snack and one meal from the on board menu. I chose the cashews (large packet) and hot pizza. Tasty and filling. If I bought both on board the cost would have been CAD $12.95. This is a great option for those who like to eat while they fly to while away the hours. The entertainment system for Android installed while boarding and a movie and TV show later we landed in Las Vegas. Not a complaint to be had or heard.

### "lost another loyal customer"
I am a frequent traveler to Toronto to Havana with Air Canada rouge. The flight is never ever on time, always delayed without any reason. My last flight was this year in October and was still the same experience. I have given them enough chance to update their service quality, unfortunately it is still same. Would never recommend, they have lost another loyal customer.

### "premium price for below par service"
Ottawa to Barcelona via Montreal with Air Canada rouge. Boarding on time, crew young professional, and friendly. No entertainment, legroom OK. Food barely edible. No free alcohol, purchase only with flight attendants warning us that bringing and drinking your own is illegal. Sad looking banana bread before landing in Barcelona. No inflight announcements by the pilots. For the return, boarding well on time but for some reason we lost our departure slot which resulted in 45 minutes delay and lost connection with no appologies. Food and service OK. Air Canada Rouge charges a premium price for below par service. Not worth the money. Try to avoid if you can.

### "cabin was very hot"
Vancouver to San Diego. The cabin was very hot the entire time and was also very dirty. But the main FA was very friendly and had a good sense of humor. On the ground, the lady at the desk didn't know what the policy for the emergency exit was and she had to call someone else who didn't know either. The inflight entertainment system was down for a good half hour and when it came back on, they had a terrible selection. The seat was very uncomfortable.

### "food and staff were good"
Glasgow to Toronto. I was not looking forward to travelling Air Canada rouge after reading the reviews but was pleasantly surprised at how good a journey my husband and I had. The food was good, the staff were good and the seating was perfectly fine. My husband is a big man and we are both tall and we found the seating to be perfectly adequate. We knew there was no inflight entertainment so we had plenty of reading materials.

### "pure torture for everyone"
Toronto to Punta Cana with Air Canada rouge. Horrible. The worst flight of my life in every possible way. Rude attendants. Many frustrated and cheap passengers. No respect. No courtesy. Everyone angry. I have a 3 year old who was given a separate seat and daddy and I were a long way from her. I finally found a vacant seat nearby so I could be relatively close. they didn't even let me hold her to calm her down during take off and landing. Will never fly this airline. It's a pity that it's dragging down the Air Canada name with it too. It makes me mad even thinking about those 2 flights. No entertainment for kids just pure torture for everyone.

### "seats are minuscule and jammed together"
I had originally booked a noon-ish flight, since we live outside the GTA. Got notification early on of a flight change to an 8.15 am flight, on the Airbus 319 (don't remember what the original aircraft was), which meant we had to stay overnight in Toronto, to avoid getting up before 3 am and risking traffic (additional $150 cost). Terrible flight. It was full, so could not book other seats. Although check-in with online and onsite kiosks was relatively painless. Seats are minuscule and jammed together. I am 5'3" and I was cramped. No inflight entertainment, except iPad to rent at $10 per. Nowhere to charge our own devices, although some online articles indicate there had been upgrades to the Airbus. Never saw the flight attendants, except at the exit door - no water, no drinks, no food even offered. Happily, we brought our own food and water, as we guessed the food would be too expensive anyhow, and I had read it was poor quality ($3+ for bottled water - really!). For a 5+ hour flight, this is unacceptable. The only bonus was, it was a non-stop.

### "seats are jammed together"
I flew Air Canada Rouge for the first time this September from Toronto to Tampa - it is the only option that Air Canada offers to Tampa and several other location. The staff was very polite and friendly and provided excellent service. The airplane was clean, but seats are jammed together and very uncomfortable. My son is 6' 4" and had a very hard time getting into and out of his seat. The person in from of me reclined their seat making it impossible for me to lower my food tray in order to place my drink on it. This style of seating is horrible and I couldn’t imagine taking it on a longer flight. Air Canada must get rid of this version of their airline.

### "absolutely a no-frills airline"
Miami to Athens via Toronto. Plane was new looking. Attendants were friendly. This is absolutely a no-frills airline. There is no form of entertainment for the passengers. A flight of three hours or less is all I would recommend. Pre-loaded iPads were offered for a rental fee of $10 which selected. Unfortunately the crew picks up the I-Pad well ahead of landing. ( I missed the last 15 minutes of the movie I paid to watch). On our second leg from Toronto to Athens, there were no iPads available, no way to recharge personal devices and that was frustrating. Food was mediocre at best. I do not recommend this airline for transatlantic flights.

### "expensive for what you get"
Toronto to Gatwick. Both outward and inward flights ran to time. Pre ordered vegetarian meal was provided and reasonably tasty. Extremely uncomfortable seats, dirty seats and seat pockets. No inflight entertainment. Passengers using their own devices without headphones thus noisy and impossible to sleep. Cabin crew not particularly professional and untidily turned out. Seating allocations a farce with whole families and partners split up and no help given to relocate. Expensive for what you get.

### "ended up on an old AC plane"
We recently had our first experience flying Air Canada Rouge. It shall be our last. First, our booking showed a Lufthansa flight number for our Ottawa to Barcelona flight via Montreal. We never thought we had been switched to Air Canada Rouge and did not discover this until check in. Imagine our surprise when we ended up on an old AC plane with no entertainment system, no air circulation system and, of course, no leg room. The Rouge service entertainment system app was not working at all so our in-flight entertainment was watching passengers with regulation-size carry on luggage try to fit their cases into overhead bins that were too small to hold anything other than a knapsack. We have flown discount airlines before, on short haul flights (2-3 hours) within North America and Europe but on those occasions we did intentionally book those flights. So why were we put on a Rouge flight when our tickets showed a Lufthansa flight number? Air Canada, you deceived us. We shall remember that.

### "given a warm welcome on board"
I have just completed my 10th flight with Air Canada rouge in their premium rouge class. I have never tried rouge or rouge plus offerings therefore I cannot comment on them. I have used premium rouge every year over the Toronto - Edinburgh route since they started in 2013. All flights have been on their B767-300. Rouge is ACs Leisure airline with lower operating costs than mainline AC, it is not advertised as a low cost carrier. It is however clearly advertised on the AC web site as a different product to mainline AC. My tip would be to do some research before you travel. On this trip I checked in at Bermuda as I was on a through ticket BDA/YYZ/EDI. Boarding at YYZ followed the standard AC arrangements with premium rouge passengers boarding in group 2. I was given a warm welcome on board having been recognized by a crew member from a previous rouge flight. The seat has similar pitch and width to those used on AC mainline business class service in N. America. (Including Bermuda & Caribbean) Each premium passenger had a small overnight amenity kit and bottled water on the seat waiting for them. Tablets for the rouge IFE system were handed out by FAs prior to departure. The use of these is included in the premium package. Departure from YYZ was a couple of minutes early and once in the air dinner menus were handed out. There was a choice of two main dishes. The drinks and meal service appeared much more professional in its presentation and co-ordination than it was in the ‘early’ days of rouge. The table ware is exactly the same as in ACs N. American business having experienced this on the earlier BDA/YYZ sector. The only issue on the flight was an un-serviceable washroom at the front of the plane. We were directed to use the facility mid-cabin. One of these, clearly for use by disabled passengers, was the biggest aircraft washroom I have every used. I managed about 2 hours light sleep or doze before a light breakfast of banana cake, juice tea/coffee was served. Arrival at EDI was a few minutes early. I continue to recommend AC premium rouge for a short (ish) trans Atlantic flight, in fact I have another premium rouge flight booked for March over DUB/YYZ, unfortunately the EDI service is summer seasonal only which for me is a bit of an niggle.

### "transatlantic flights were the worst"
Casablanca to Montreal with Air Canda rouge. Air Canada should see "rouge" with embarrasment. Travelling from Montreal to Casablanca proved to be a trip from hell. Of course those of us seated in the rear of the plane were left with the vegetarian option only as they ran out of the chicken dish halfway thru. The cabin crew had absolutely no control, people got up when not supposed to and most of their requests were totally ignored. The second beverage service was stopped halfway thru as it was time to prepare for landing. Hoping against hope the return flight would be a more assuring experience, the opposite was true. Again the vegetarian choice only, no offer of being able to purchase an alcoholic beverage (the traveller in front of me was told it was too turbulent to serve wine). Two of the staff sat in the back playing on their phones, a third had a blanket over her head trying to sleep. The second beverage service never took place but people routinely went to the back to get their own coffee or whatever else they needed. Balancing hot coffee walking down an airplane aisle is not an easy task. These transatlantic flights were the worst ever.

### "never fly Rouge again"
San Diego to Toronto. Last minute travel requirements forced me onto an Air Canada Rouge flight. At 6'2" my legs were stuck in the seat back and I could not move for the duration of a 5 hour flight. Sitting near the back, there was no chance at a hot meal and the attendant seemed surprised I wanted to purchase a meal. These planes should be restricted to short-haul. Anyone who has an opportunity to choose another carrier even at a slightly higher cost will never be a repeat customer on Rouge. I have no clue what Air Canada is thinking jamming customers into a sub-class plane on a 5 hour flight. I will never fly Rouge again.

### "thought the crew was very good"
Venice to Toronto. I was glad I read the reviews of Air Canada Rouge before I flew it for the first time. It helped me set low expectations, which is the key to having a better experience. I was a bit nervous that our 9 hour flight from Venice to Toronto was going to be purely awful, but it wasn't as bad as expected. Check in was completed in about 3 minutes. The plane was on the older side, but was in fairly decent shape. The center bathroom in the middle of the plane is the largest bathroom I've ever been in on an airplane. Easily twice the size of a normal plane bathroom. We were in 25A/C and the seats are normal economy seats. It didn't feel more cramped than other economy cabins I've flown in. There is no entertainment available, so make sure you download the Air Canada app on your tablet or phone before you board. There are quite a few movie choices on the app, but most of them are old. We experienced no problems with the connectivity on this flight. On this flight we were offered a hot meal (pasta or chicken), a snack (bag of cookies) and then a hot snack (chicken or veggie wrap). Alcohol is available for purchase and the crew were constantly wandering through the cabin offering water. The food was decent and typical of other economy class meals I've had. I read a lot negative comments about the crew. Our experience was different. We thought the crew was very good. All of them were pleasant and helpful. Only one of them on our flight rarely smiled, but overall they were good. All of them are multilingual, speaking two, three or four languages. Whether or not our experience with Rouge was an anomaly, the key here is to know what to expect and adjust your expectations accordingly. And don't forget to download that app, or your flight will feel twice as long.

### "incredibly unprofessional"
I am a frequent flyer - within North America, Europe and to and from. Never have I come across such a disorganized and unprofessional airline. Myself and a friend paid for choice seating and weren't booked next to each other for all 4 of our flights. When we asked to be switched they said they couldn't do it, even though we paid for this feature. On our last leg from Toronto to Dublin our flight was overbooked and we got bumped to the flight the following day. The Air Canada rouge staff assured us that we would be put in a hotel and we would be able to collect our bags for that night. We just had a 12 hour layover in Toronto, we needed clean clothes from our luggage. After hours of sorting everything out the staff member waves us goodbye as we go to get our luggage. We get to the baggage claim and staff there is telling us we cannot collect our bags, they're put away and no one can get them until 9am. (It was 1am at this point). Of course we were angry, but we were more tired than anything so we decided to just go to the hotel. 25 minute drive to the hotel, we go to check in and the man at the front desk looks at us like we have 7 heads saying "Air Canada called and we told them we have no rooms available. We're fully booked, your booking doesn't exist". We're livid. We're exhausted. It's 2am at this point. We go all the way back to the airport to find that it's practically closed. There's about 3 airport employees none of whom know where we can find Air Canada employees. Eventually after wandering through "authorized personnel only" and "do not enter" areas we find a desk with a line of angry customers all in the exact same situation as we are. They put us in a new hotel and we didn't arrive until 3am. Incredibly unprofessional - I wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone.

### "the staff were excellent"
Toronto to Dublin. Poorly staffed and managed at Pearson Airport, Toronto. Couldn't change seats at check even though I checked in early as possible. This caused major concern as we were travelling with 2 small children one of whom is an infant and therefore was designated to sit on my lap. Our child's pushchair was sent directly to baggage hall on arrival in Dublin so I had to carry my luggage and small child all the way there. No inflight entertainment unless you have Apple technology and food was poor at best. The big positive is the staff were excellent and tried their best to help.

### "Use it for convenience"
Winnipeg to Manchester via Toronto. Air Canada Rouge which claims to be a budget carrier but is as expensive as Air Canada. I only use Rouge because it gets me from Manchester to Toronto without changing. The seats are uncomfortable. There are no TV screens. The food is below average and alcohol is paid for. Service levels are below those of regular Air Canada flights. Use it for convenience, but nothing else.

### "our experience was awful"
Our experience with Air Canada Rouge was awful. In fairness, I should have done more research before buying the tickets. Our experience was Toronto to Dublin return. We flew from Toronto to Dublin on a red-eye flight, I can't comment on the experience too much as we were all asleep. The way back though was a nightmare. I was traveling by myself with our 2 year old daughter, and found out our plane from Dublin to Toronto was delayed by 2 hours when we got to the airport. I started to get worried though as we had a connecting flight in Toronto, and though the layover was 2.5 hours, 2 hours delay is starting to cut things close. After occupying ourselves for 5 hours at the airport (which was actually an amazing airport) we went to get on the plane to look forward to 7 hours of flying. As we boarded there was somebody on the flight not feeling well, and the plane (and everyone on board and with connecting flights) then waited for 30 more minutes to see if they were going to get better. So 2.5 hours late, 5.5 hours since getting to the airport, we take off. The staff were awful, no friendly service or smiles, and when I asked about what was going to happen to people with connecting flights, the attendant told me "You'll have to ask once you get to the airport"! Even further, there were no apologies by the flight staff or pilots the whole flight about the delay, and almost everyone on board missed their connecting flights. The service was the exact opposite of what customer service is. Needless to say, we missed our connecting flight, but we were the lucky ones. You have to download the Air Canada app to get any entertainment before you board, so 7 hours without any entertainment is more than you should ask of anyone. The only consolation was the food was pretty good and tasty.

### "doesn't have movies/headphone jacks"
Prague to Toronto. Violin Cruise Line booked my sister and me on Air Canada from Prague to Toronto. Little did I know that the flight was on Air Canada rouge that doesn't have movies/headphone jacks and expects one to know that one must fly with their own IPad and headphones plus download the Air Canada app prior to takeoff. They mention downloading the app but I did not realise it is mandatory to do so to be able to watch movies on one's cell phone or IPad until one is in the air and it is too late! (Unless you wish to rent their IPad). It was nearly 9 hours in a seat that did not recline with discount beverages and lousy meals.

### "I am very disappointed"
My husband and I traveled to and from Athens from Toronto on Air Canada Rouge flights. The crew on board was an unhappy bunch. No service with a smile. The plane was dirty and we were crammed in like sardines. There was no snack offered before landing in Athens. The breakfast was a piece of banana bread wrapped in saran wrap served with coffee or juice. I am furious that there was a menu for items for purchase that in fact were not available except for items on page 3 which included licorice and potato chips. How could there not be water and other food items available for sale on an international flight? I guess having a captive audience means you can arbitrarily choose to limit menu options. If this is the case, tell passengers ahead of time so they are not at your mercy. I am very disappointed and will never fly Air Canada rouge again.

### "dirty and absolutely worn out"
Air Canada Rouge. Sounds nice somehow, but that's all it is. A nice sounding brand. Should be renamed to Air Canada Rough. First leg between Boston and Toronto on an old battered Embraer. Dirty and absolutely worn out. On the plus side I have to mention that they actually had free WiFi. Made me have good hopes for the second leg. Toronto Budapest. But what an illusion. An even older 767-300. The seats felt like a taxi in Sofia. Entertainment system? I asked the purser where they had hidden the touch screens. He told me that I had to use my own phone to be able to see a movie, or rent an Ipad. They had wifi he promised me. Then I looked for a USB, to able to charge my phone. Non existent. However there were 110v power outlets. For those with American plugs on their chargers, or the one with adapters. I didn't have one. But it wouldn't have helped me much, as there was one one outlet for two seats. This is a 9 hour flight. Food? Could choose between chicken and pasta. The chicken dish was not tasty and sad looking. Breakfast was a cup of coffee and something that might have been a carrot cake. One bite and I'd had enough. Thing is, this is not an budget airline. Prices are premium. They are supposed to compete with Lufthansa, BA and American. I thought TAP was the worst transatlantic carrier - until now. Next trip will be with Norwegian on a Dreamliner.

### "definitely travel Air Canada rouge again"
I read recent reviews a week before flying out to Toronto from Manchester. I was horrified to find such a low rating and scathing reviews. I can honestly report that on both the journey out on 24th August and return on 3rd September we left pretty much on time and arrived at the scheduled time. The seat length, knee room, comfort were comparable to most other flights that we have taken albeit to Europe. If you are large you might struggle but that's a different argument. My husband is 6 foot and managed. The staff were organised and attentive but I did witness some expression of irritation from an overly demanding customer or two. High maintenance passengers would test the patience of saints! The food was good for in flight catering - let's face it this is not a restaurant but an aeroplane. Using your own iPad is a great idea but the app must be downloaded before the flight. Better website description of what is offered is a must as a bit lacking in detail. Overall we were satisfied and would definitely travel with Canada rouge again. Thanks.

### "felt cramped and claustrophobic"
Didn't realise when I booked this that the flight was with Air Canada Rouge rather than Air Canada. I have flown with Air Canada before and they were good - however, Air Canada Rouge is another thing entirely. I'm not tall (5'5") and I felt cramped and claustrophobic as the seats were so close together - they were also incredibly uncomfortable and the colour scheme (grey and red) just made the whole interior look grimy. As it was a transatlantic flight from Toronto to London Gatwick we did get a complimentary meal - I had ordered a vegetarian meal and I have to say it was the worst airline meal I've ever had - completely inedible. Continental breakfast was a very sad looking muffin - looked too disgusting to even attempt to eat it. I had downloaded the entertainment app and was able to log on easily and access the entertainment - however the choice of films and programmes was extremely poor. The staff on board weren't the friendliest I've ever experienced - a bit brusque to be honest. The only positive about the whole experience was that the flight left on time and arrived on time. All in all, I would avoid this airline in future, I know their fares are cheap but it really is no frills with a vengeance and on a transatlantic flight, you need a bit more comfort and a decent meal.

### "check-in was a bit slow"
Montreal to Athens with Air Canada rouge. Had more leg room because we were in front of the plane. This is the only option for a direct flight from Montreal to Athens. At Athens, check-in was a bit slow even though we had priority check-in. Some of the flight attendants were kind but others did not seem in a good mood.

### "narrow cramped seats"
Flew Toronto to Dublin with Air Canada rouge. Narrow cramped seats, very close to the one in front. No air controls above, no entertainment unless you rented an iPad. Food ok and cabin crew were young and inexperienced but tried hard. We will never ever again step onto a rouge flight. Most uncomfortable flight we have ever experienced.

### "pleasantly surprised"
Vancouver to Kansai Osaka. We booked tickets with Air Canada Rouge knowing they were a budget airline which was reflected in the price we paid. Both outbound and inbound flights were on-time. Boarding was by zone and fine with no delays. There was plenty of room in the overhead bins, though some people were determined in trying to cram in large carry-ons instead of checking them. Flight crew were friendly and professional. Seats were 30" pitch which is tight. The meals on the outbound from Canada were ok, but pretty good on the inbound from Japan (must be the umami). My one complaint is that wine and beer had to be purchased and there was only one drinks run. The crew were great about bringing water through the cabin. We knew ahead that we had to download the Air Canada entertainment app. - if you didn't have an iPad, you could rent one for $10. There seemed to be more choice on the rented ipads. The movie choices were pretty basic, but I enjoyed the rerun of 'In the Heat of the Night". Air Canada rouge is a budget airline - the old adage of 'you pay for what you get' is pretty applicable here. If you realize this up front, then there shouldn't be any surprises. Overall, we were worried after reading these reviews, but pleasantly surprised and will probably fly Rouge again.

### "I do not recommend"
Manchester to Toronto with Air Canada rouge. Awful. I do not recommend. No inflight entertainment, food rubbish, service very poor, the most uncomfortable seating ever experienced. They call it 'rouge', the most appropriate name has got to be Air Canada 'rough'.

### "plane very dirty"
Air Canada rouge has got to be the worst airline that we have flown. We flew from Vancouver to Honolulu on a B767 aircraft. It was a very old airplane and a very dirty one too. Such neglect is simply unacceptable in the 21st century. A very bad image for the mother company indeed. I understand that it is a cheaper airline but still they have to do something about cleanliness. Nevertheless, I have to say that cabin crew was very polite and professional.

### "very poor value for money"
London Gatwick to Toronto with Air Canada rouge during August 2016. This was a very poor flight. There many faults. First, there was no inflight entertainment at all. We were told that there was inflight WiFi but this did not work. Very disappointing on such a long flight. The food was also poor and the announcements on the tannoy system were frequently inaudible. But by far, the worst aspect of the flight was the very limited legroom available. I am over 6' tall, and I struggled to find a comfortable position throughout this flight. On a long 8 hour flight I would have expected more room. I have flown many times with other carriers and have had adequate leg room on longer flights. I have also sometimes flown on short European low cost airline carriers with more legroom than this, and they are much cheaper carriers. What is surprising is that we flew a much shorter connecting flight (just over 4 hours) from Toronto to Victoria BC with Air Canada and had all the facilities that I described above. So why did Air Canada rouge not provide a better service for the much longer leg of the journey? I don't like to sound so negative and would not give negative feedback easily but this carrier were very poor value for money.

### "seats were too small"
Athens to Montreal with Air Canada rouge. The the seats were too small for a 10 hours trip. They give you a pillow and a blanket on your seat, my pillow was missing and I asked 3 times for a pillow and the staff ignored me. No entertainment screens and if you didn't have a tablet or a phone with their app you couldn't use the entertainment shows. They told me that you have to rent an iPad for $10. The food was terrible and I will have to reconsider travelling with Air Canada rouge in the future.

### "not enough seats for all passengers"
Toronto to Orlando with Air Canada rouge. One word - awful. My son and I started planning our first trip to Orlando since December 2015. We purchased the tickets in December for 4 days (14-19 August). We got to the airport on the 14th, 3 hours before the flight, did the check in and got to the gate. That’s when the Air Canada agents made the announcement that there were not enough seats for all the passengers and 7 of us had to stay behind. I was furious, my 8 year old boy in tears. How can an airline overbook a flight to Orlando in August? Unacceptable. We had to go back to customer service, the lady offered us the flight for the day after, a night at a hotel and $800 of compensation (to be received in 15 days supposedly). The $800, were nothing compared to the stress level we had to suffer because of their unprofessionalism. We weren’t able to contact our hotel in Orlando, which triggered a cancellation of the booking as a no show. When we finally got there the day after, I had to take money out of my trip budget to book a new room (as the money takes few business days to re-appear on a credit card). Our trip (already short) was shortened by an additional day. I will never take Air Canada rouge or Air Canada again. I am offering another trip to my son for March break next year, I will take WestJet, no doubt about it.

### "selection of TV and movies is grim"
Halifax to Calgary with Air Canada rouge. Flight crew were profesional and the flight took off and landed on time. The only other positve is Rouge seems to have reached the bottom in terms of passenger discomfort. It can not be possible to cram any more passengers into the aircraft. At 5'10" tall I can generally fit comfortably in a seat but when the passenger in front of my took there seat my knees were pushed back throughout the flight. So to continue with an effort to see the silver lining Rouge is the airline to fly for short people. Inflight entertainment is a $10.00 rented iPad, or if you've downloaded the AirCanada App you can use your own. Forewarned I did so. Selection of TV and movies is grim. It makes Canadian Netflix look really good. And for the privilge of watching a film your not terribly interested in seeing you get to watch 5 or 6 commerials. Never again for me. Interesting to note the plane was full. So clearly Rouge has accurately worked out that passengers will accept all this. To make the best of all this: Bring your own food, Download your own movie or games beforehand, mentally prepare to be reduced to less than elbow room-unless you're fortunate enough to be really small or fly with someone else.

### "basically a budget airline"
Flew Air Canada Rouge as it was more convenient to fly from Gatwick but never again, we were not warned before we booked it is basically a budget airline (not budget priced) which was not great for such a long flight. There were no announcements from the cockpit re where we were flying over etc.. It was three hours before they brought a drink round, it was a good job we took water on board with us. Food was not great and the breakfast was a slice of cake, asked twice for a cup of hot water so that I could make myself a decaf coffee but it never arrived. Seat space is quite cramped and no seat back entertainment. I did use the app on my tablet but the choice of films was extremely poor and my partner does not have one. there were no monitors either. I have flown several airlines but this was the worst one for comfort and service avoid if possible.

### "it's all about the money"
Flew Air Canada rouge from Liberia to Manchester via Toronto. Absolute disgrace of an airline. Had to wait for over four hours for drinks service on outgoing flight. No TVs as they want you to rent their iPads with horrendous viewing options. Flight delayed by four hours on return. Only told we could get food vouchers 30 mins before we boarded - again it's all about the money. We had no food on a flight of over 5 hours. We checked with staff in Toronto that we didn't need to collect our bags for our connection which they confirmed. Lo and behold our bags didn't arrive as we'd been told. Avoid these utter clowns at all costs.

### "seats not comfortable"
Flew Glasgow to Toronto with Air Canada Rouge. Worst flight in years. Seats not comfortable. No overhead storage for our luggage. Poor breakfast, late on take off with no reason given until pressured by some of the passengers. 2.5 hours late on boarding. Went by section and never asked for elderly or young children to board first. Lukewarm tea and ages to get hot tea. Food bad. All managers should be forced to fly this plane on all business flights for 2 years to understand how bad it was.

### "most appalling flight experience"
Unhelpful and aggressive staff. After paying a full adult fare for a seat for our 18 month old, the online check-in didn't show toilets behind our seats, nor that they didn't recline. After speaking to cabin staff to request a move a gate attendant came onboard, offering a flight the next day without information on cost, accomodation or times. She then demanded we make a decision, refused to answer any questions and threatened to bring police/security onboard to remove a young family. Additionally: Check-in process was excessively lengthy as the machines at the airport wouldn't print our boarding passes so we couldn't use bag drop. Advanced passenger information system, didn't work with false emails saying we hadn't supplied information, then when logging in, all information was present. Had to wait on hold for 40 mins to get information about child restraint device. My most appalling flight experience with Air Canada rouge from Toronto to London Gatwick.

### "overall we got value for money"
Toronto to London Gatwick with Air Canada rouge. Was dreading flying with this airline after reading the awful reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm 6ft 3 and didn't find the seat pitch too bad. I researched the airline and tool my own films to compensate for no entertainment. Cabin staff were friendly. Food was ok. Overall we got value for money.

### "we were very disappointed"
We paid $1000 extra for 2 to fly more comfortably on Air Canada Rouge Premium Economy. We wanted extra leg room because of the 10 hour flight from Athens to Montreal. We were very disappointed in the seats which hardly gave us extra room, no TV screens, the same meal as everyone else on the plane. We were handed a menu with 2 choices and although we were seated in seat 1 h, one of the choices was not available. We were promised an amenity kit which we never got and our luggage did not come out in priority.

### "budget airline at premium prices"
Flew from Manchester to Toronto. If you have an alternative then take it. I take about 20 flights a year on various airlines. Air Canada rouge has been the worst. The food is poor, its poor on Air Canada too. There's no TV, you have to take your own iPad or similar, and there's nowhere to charge it. They even charge you for using your own iPad and your own electricity. All alcohol is paid for and tickets are not cheap. It's a budget airline at premium prices. Easyjet could teach them a thing or two. I only used the flight to avoid having to fly via London. They should take the e off the end of rouge and put an h there. Air Canada Rough, much closer to the facts.

### "shoved in an extra 50 or so seats"
Dublin to Toronto. Never again. The claim is that this is a budget airline, however, I don't consider $1300 "budget. Basically, Air Canada has taken its standard Boeing 767-300 aircraft and shoved an extra 50 or so seats into it. I am a little over 6 feet, and I felt like I needed a knee transplant after this flight. And like many other reviews posted here, the flight was an hour late leaving the terminal - no discernible reason, the aircraft arrived at station an hour before the scheduled departure - no announcement of the delay either.

### "the staff were impolite"
Barcelona to San francisco via Montreal with Air Canada rouge. I'm a frequent traveller and this airline has been one of the worst ones I've tried. From customer service to plane. I'm a Star Alliance gold member and on both flights, I was seated completely separated from my wife and we were on the same booking. It doesn't help the staff were impolite and we were delayed. No seatback entertainment either and even if you download the app, the movie selection is old. It's sad really, I heard a lot of bad things but expected the staff service to be good so I wanted to give them a proper shot. I was wrong. Believe the reviews. It's a budget airline for a reason. This was the only airline arriving at the time I needed in SFO, if there were other options, I definitely would've gone the other way.

### "delayed by 1-3 hours"
Super budget quality airline at not such a budget price. Flew from Minneapolis to Athens via Toronto with Air Canada rouge. There was a single person to help 50 plus customers to check in in Minneapolis. Operated at turtle speed. Over one hour to check in. All 4 flights in a 10 day span were delayed by 1-3 hours, very cramped aircrafts and seats, aircraft not really suitable for transatlantic flights if you are over 5'10". Never agin Air Canada, never again.

### "crew very helpful and service very good"
Toronto to Manchester. Ended up on this flight due to delays causing me to miss my original flight so rebooked onto this one, rather than a standard Air Canada flight. All done by airline so this wasn't apparent I was on a low cost carrier. As its an evening flight not too worried about food but the breakfast was a slice of banana loaf, not brilliant. The flight was very empty so after take people took other rows to sleep on. The seats are not great but armrests go up all the way if you have centre row seats so you can lie down. Crew were very helpful and service was very good. Since I'd paid a full fare, I was annoyed that if I wanted a glass of wine I had to pay. Entertainment system was a pain had to get cabin staff to reboot system as it wasn't working. Took me 20 mins to config my laptop with reboots for it to work then it buffered quite a bit. Reload of software another reboot got it going. Also used iphone with app initially seemed to work better. Other option is to rent their ipad at $10. Flight on time so cannot complain about that. Next time will be very careful when booking Air Canada to ensure schuduled flights only. Seems to be the Air Canada Rouge flight number start 19 so check if you are booking on line. Low cost carriers fine for short trips but 7 hours transatlantic is too much. Feel sorry for the Lisbon flight which is nearly 10 hours!

### "we will not be a returning customer"
My family and I traveled from Chicago to Barcelona and back to Chicago from Venice. All 4 flights we flew with Air Canada Rouge. Of these 4 flights, all 4 were either delayed a minimum of 1.5-3 hours or cancelled completely due to mechanical issues. Instead of telling us the real reason the flight was being delayed they told us, "It's taking another 2 hours to load luggage or there is too much traffic at the destinations terminal. Once we land members from their crew tell us the real reason for the delay which just makes us more annoyed by the whole situation. Now don't get me wrong, I'd rather have them delay a flight than put an unsuitable plane in the air. But, it is not okay to make excuses for them. Thankfully because all the flights were delayed we only missed 1 flight, which was our flight back home. We had to pressure customer service to put us in a hotel because they didn't think their delayed flights was their problem. Needless to say, representatives from their company were rude. With the time change, we were traveling for 25 hours and very tired. My family and I fly quite frequently and after the experiences we have gone through with this airline it is safe to say we will not be a returning customer.

### "customer service is terrible"
I flew Air Canada Rouge on an international flight from Budapest - Toronto, 9.5 hours. This is an ultra basic airline, awful seats with no in-flight entertainment. Generally the crew are pleasant, but that's because the airline is terrible and they try to make up for it with water. On this flight they ran out of food, so about a dozen people didn't get anything. The reply was "Sorry, you should've booked a seat closer to the front. That is unacceptable for an international 9.5 hour flight. The customer service is terrible. No effort was made to rectify the situation, just a shoulder shrug. The flight was not cheap - stay away from Rouge. Pay an extra $20 and go Air Transat.

### "flight attendants were nice"
Flew Air Canada Rouge to Lisbon from Toronto and with all the negative reviews, I was coming into this flight with very low expectations. However, I was actually pleasantly surprised. Our flight headed out to Lisbon was delayed by 2 hours due to mechanical issues but Air Canada actually gave everyone on that flight a $10 meal voucher, which was very nice of them. The seats were nothing great but were acceptable for not so tall people like myself. Flight attendants were nice for the most part and they all seemed to be pretty committed to their job. The food was so-so but I wasn't very hungry anyway considering it was in the middle of the night when the food was served. Overall it is true that this airline is a big downgrade from the regular Air Canada mainline, I think it is very acceptable and you definetly get what you pay for.

### "do your research and be prepared"
Having flown on Rouge economy class several times on leisure trans-border (Vancouver to and from Honolulu as well as Las Vegas) and international (Vancouver to and from Osaka), I’ve decided to write this review. Rouge is an airline under the Air Canada brand designed to compete against Canadian low cost carriers like WestJet, Sunwing, Air Transat, etc. If you can get past this point, you will be fine. Seat comfort: I’ve tried both the Airbus 319 and Boeing 767 seats. The Airbus is indeed a little cramped. But leg room on the Boeing is fine. If you’re willing to pay extra, opt for certain rows that have additional leg room when you book your ticket. You have a choice! Otherwise, don’t complain about leg room. Cabin staff service: Generally a younger demographic of flight attendants. Most seem to enjoy what they are doing. Economy cabin is high density seating configured. On a Boeing 767 economy class, there are 258 seats with only four flight attendants working the cabin. On the Airbus 319 economy class, there are 124 seats with two flight attendants. Honestly with what the flight attendants have to work with, I’d say they are good at what they do while still able to give a genuine smile. Constant running around with hot water for oatmeal and soup noodles during service, replenishing coffee and tea pots, running to the back galley oven for pizza and oven items, etc. Staff to passenger ratio in the Premium Economy cabin is obviously different but I won’t be covering that in this review. Food and beverages and amenities: Basic non-alcoholic beverages like coffee, tea, juice, pop are complimentary on all Rouge flights. On trans-border flights, like Hawaii and Las Vegas, you pay for everything else - meals, snacks, blankets, pillow. On international flights, for example Osaka, you get a complimentary meal, usually chicken or beef, then a mid-flight cookie service, followed by a light meal before landing. Blankets and pillows are included in every seat. You pay for wine, beer and spirits. Additional snacks like chips and candy outside of the mid-flight service can be purchased any time. Fair enough. Inflight entertainment: This is the one that gets me every time I board a Rouge plane and I feel for the flight attendants that have to deal with so so many clueless passengers that complain “Oh there are no TV’s on this old plane?” Listen carefully, just download the Air Canada app for free onto your device before getting on the airplane, be it an iOS or Android device. It is the same app that you use to check-in and see AC and Rouge flight schedules. There is a section in the app called Rouge player that allows you to watch movies and television for free once the aircraft reaches a safe cruising altitude for onboard wireless streaming. There are charging outlets on their Airbus 321 and Boeing 767, not Airbus 319. Are we clear? Also you can rent one of their iPads for $10 CAD, pre-loaded non-streaming new Hollywood releases included on their rental iPads. Flight attendants go down the aisle with rental iPads shortly after takeoff. Do I recommend Rouge? For family and leisure travel, yes definitely. I think that’s what Rouge was originally designed for anyway. The added bonus with Rouge being integrated into AC’s well established brand and network. Just do your research and be prepared eg. mobile app for entertainment.

### "flight itself was perfect"
Prague to Toronto with Air Canada rouge. I was nervous reading the reviews prior, however after my flight I was nicely surprised. Yes the aircraft is a bit older and there is a poor selection in terms of entertainment , but apart from that the service and the flight itself was perfect.

### "what kind of service is this"
My wife and my 2 children travelled to Toronto Canada on 26th June 2016 with Air Canada AC1925. I am disappointed with how my wife and 2 children (2 years and 3years) were treated on board by the air hostesses. My daughter spilt drinks on her sandwich by mistake (given by the airline) so my wife requested another. The air hostess was rude and said they could not provide another at that moment and they would provide one if they had any remaining after serving all other passengers. I understand they need to serve other passengers, but for a 2 and half year old child to wait until all passengers were served to get another sandwich? What kind of service is this. Not only that but when you call the air hostesses passing by they completely ignore you.

### "needed the Air Canada rouge app"
I travelled with Air Canada rouge on the Dublin to Vancouver direct flight in June 2016. I have flown extensively on long haul flights and don't usually review stuff but I feel I need to on this point. The aircraft that flew Dublin to Vancouver didn't have the inflight entertainment facilities that I expected for a long haul flight (10 hours flight). Basically if you don't have your own iPad/ tablet to laptop you are unable to use the inflight entertainment system to stream the movies etc. Luckily they did have a limited number of iPads to loan (at a cost) on Dub to Vancouver flight - on the return flight (similar aircraft was used), the flight was full with passengers and there were not enough iPads on board to loan out to passengers. I had to use my small smartphone but as I didn't know I needed to have the Air Canada rouge app on my phone the vast majority of movies/tv shows I could not watch, needless to say the flight home was very very long and I was very disappointed. Air Canada rouge  should have notified their passengers that if they wanted to use the inflight entertainment, passengers should bring a suitable device and have their app downloaded prior to boarding flights.

### "everything you read is so true"
Everything you read about Air Canada rouge is so true. If you want bad food and extremely cramped seats this is the airline for you. I even paid extra for a bulkhead seat and even with the "extra leg room" it was cramped beyond belief. I paid extra for the bulkhead but the guy next to me got the seat just by saying he was too tall to sit in a regular seat. The food was below standard and just tasted bad. The only redeeming value was the flight crew. They were great. I will avoid this airline at all cost in the future. People were standing in the aisle just to stretch their legs. If your looking for inflight entertainment make sure you download their app and watch it on your iPad because that is the only inflight entertainment they have.

### "fine in the air"
Flew Air Canada rouge on both legs of a return trip to Toronto. I was worried about the reviews referring to cramped seating position so we purchased extra leg room seats in advance. The extra leg room seats made the flight very comfortable and so I have no complaints based on this being a budget airline offering. Without extra legroom seats my thoughts would have been different because the seat pitch in the standard seat looked very small indeed. On the return leg at the airport I tried to upgrade us to premium economy, Air Canada Rouge agents are a shambles. I was sent off to 3 different places before someone gave me a price that bore no resemblance to the price quoted on the internet. They couldn't even be sure if the price included or excluded the premium I had already paid for extra legroom seats. There were other people trying to sort things out with the agents and displaying a similar level of frustration to me. In short Air Canada Rouge are fine in the air, just don't ask their ground agents anything unless you have the patience of a saint.

### "a money grab from Air Canada"
Me and my wife booked our vacation package June 13 to June to June 20, 2016 to Dominican Republic, Samana. We got our boarding pass online. To our surprise, Air Canada gave us separate seats, even though we booked the trip together. We were told that by Air Canada airport agent that the plane was full and could not give us seats together. However, if we insisted on getting seats together there would be an extra cost. The same thing happened on our return trip to Canada. On the return flight there were 3 empty seats in row 32 A, B and C. One steward very rudely told us that these seats were for the crew only. This is plain and simple a money grab from Air Canada. We never had this problem with Air Transat or WestJet. For future trips, we will do our best to avoid flying with Air Canada Rouge.

### "seat was broken"
First and last time that my partner and I will fly with Air Canada Rouge. Appreciated that this is supposed to be a budget airline but that does not mean that customer service should not be provided. On settling in to our seats flying from London Gatwick to Toronto, my partner informed the hostess that his seat was broken and would not sit up at all. The washrooms were clean on first boarding but they did not appear to have any cleaning throughout which was appalling. The food was very mediocre with limited choice of soft drinks. Towards the end of the flight I pressed the call button to request a glass of water, waited 20 minutes and called again, still no response. A hostess walked by collecting rubbish so I asked her for some water. Another 10 minutes passed and still no water. Another hostess then walked by and I asked again, she said she was not sure she could still get one. She then came back with water run from the washrooms, which stated clearly 'not drinking water'. The water was warm and tasted disgusting. I gave the water to another hostess after taking a dip who was rude an did not even stop to speak with me. On disembarkation there was only 1 hostess at the exit doors, she was not even trying to look interested and did not smile or say thank you or goodbye to any of the passengers. All in all, they have a lot to improve to get it up to standard.

### "jammed in like sardines"
My second and (this time I swear) last flight on AC rouge flying from Orlando to Toronto. The food offerings and staff service had improved since my first flight two years ago but that's all. We were jammed in like sardines, my rear was numb after one hour owing to the thin seat cushions, no entertainment, and a filthy washroom. To top it all off, I came down with a cold two days later, no doubt owing to the close proximity to other coughing sneezing travellers. Avoid.

### "food was absolutely vile"
Toronto to Prague with Air Canada rouge. First of all let me say for some reason I expected a lot from my first flight on Air Canada rouge going from Toronto to Prague. That said however given the state of the airline industry today perhaps I was just having a senior moment. When we boarded the plane we found out that unless we downloaded the Air Canada App we would not be able to use the Air Canada Rouge entertainment system once airborne. It would have been nice to have been informed during the 3 hour layover in Toronto rather than being told on the plane as the doors were closing. My partner’s Apple operating system had not been upgraded to the current version and because of that the app would not load on her iPad. We did load it on my and her iPhone which means we were relegated to watching movies on our phone screens. Of course we could have rented an iPad for $10 from the flight attendants. When the Air Canada App is accessed you are subjected to 8 – 10 commercials before your movie or TV choice is viewed. And don’t make an error and try to see some other choice because you will have to go through all the ads again. The choice of available films was very dated and limited and although films like X-Men and Hunger games would certainly appeal to many they are not my cup of tea so I decided to listen to the classical music selections. Again here the choices were again very meager and while listening to Chopin the app would not stay open and would shut down every few minutes, which was very annoying. I finally gave up on it and shut the phone down totally. It was at this point that the flight attendants started the meal service. The choices for the entrees were pasta or chicken. I elected for the pasta and my partner selected the chicken. I will admit that being second generation Italian has spoiled me for my taste in pasta however I am fond of dishes such as macaroni and cheese and baked pasta when it is prepared well, so I would not classify myself as a foodie snob. There was nothing about either meal that we were served except the chocolate cake that could ever be classified as done well. The food was absolutely vile. I would very strongly suggest that Air Canada find another caterer. We both found our meal inedible and only ate a couple of bites. Fortunately we had brought some cheese and carrots from home and we ate those along with the not very good wine that was sold. Now getting back to Air Canada’s Wi-Fi. It can only be used to access the entertainment system, which means that you have to spend 7 or 8 hours in a plane with no Internet access. That is bad enough for the casual traveler however the business customer is put at a distinct disadvantage when he/she cannot utilize the time to accomplish work online. Given the choice I can honestly say that I will never fly Air Canada rouge again.

### "aircraft was filthy"
Nanaimo to Barcelona via Toronto with Air Canada rouge. We have just returned from a cruise out of Barcelona and flew from Nanaimo to Vancouver to Toronto with mainline Air Canada and the flights were great. We got a shock when we got on Air Canada rouge. The aircraft was filthy and bathroom floor. The food was horrible, staff were not unpleasant but were not friendly either. We were not informed prior to departure that we were on a no frill flight and quite shocked to see no TV screens. Had to pay for a drink on an International Flight and $10.00 for iPad rental. Flight on return was from Athens back to Nanaimo. In future, I will pay extra not to fly Air Canada rouge.

### "customer service is very poor"
I fly with Air Canada four times a month and the last trip from Las Vegas to Toronto was by far the worst. I purchased an upgrade to Business Class, obtained my boarding pass and boarded the plane. The gate agent then came on board on told me I had to move back to economy class because they had sold the seat twice. I told them no, they brought on a supervisor who then told me a different story, they needed the seat for a pilot. They then told me I could move back to economy or I could get off the plane. They did offer me a refund, but only if I contacted Air Canada via email only. Customer service does not have a phone number. This airline is almost always late and customer service is very poor as I described above.

### "plenty of legroom"
Flew from Montreal to Athens. I've traveled on Air Canada Rouge before in Economy class and it was not the best, mostly because of the small legroom. I had a booking on standby for Preminum Economy and I got a seat in economy class because the Preminum cabin was full. I was happy with the seat I got because it was a bulkhead so there was plenty of legroom. On the return leg I got a Premium seat which was very comfortable but not so much for sleep. The meals were complementary and were very good. The crew and the service on board was also good. The crew were passing often to offer drinks during the whole flight in the Premium cabin. The inflight entertainment was on a tablet provided the in Premium class otherwise it's on your own smartphone or tablet with the App. The App worked well as I had use it on a previous trip. There was also a pillow and a blanket provied for each passenger for the flights. Another downside is that there's no charging ports on board. Overall Air Canada rouge has the same level of service with the mainline but not the same level of legroom in Economy class. It's better to choose a different airline with a connecting flight for the same price, based on the legroom. However the Economy Premium product is very good and if I could afford it I would travel again in that cabin more often.

### "situation was pretty stupid"
AC 1898, I was flying to Vegas from Kansai and had the "pleasure" of flying Air Canada Rouge in economy for the last leg between Vancouver and Vegas. I was going to the washroom and was stuck behind the cart handing out drinks, the hostess asked if I would wait 4 or 5 minutes and I said okay, however I proceeded to wait 20 while they continued to care to passengers who wanted alcohol. That being said the business class washrooms were completely empty, when 15 mins were up I asked if some of us could just use that and she responded that she was done and then went on to ask some more passengers ahead of her if they wanted drinks - she was definitely not done and made us all wait longer. There wasn't even an apology after we were all allowed to go to the washroom, other passengers who weren't waiting for the washroom thought the situation was pretty stupid too. I think that this was quite ridiculous as I am sure that serving alcohol is not the priority on a 2hrs and 45 minute flight but people who want to head to the washroom may be a tad above that need. I usually have great flights with Air Canada and its maybe because I usually try taking the upgraded seats. A frankly bewildered flyer.

### "really bad experience"
I flew with Air Canada Rouge from Lima to Toronto . All in all a really bad experience and if you can avoid them do it! For a 7,5 hour long flight there wasn't an IFE screen at the seats. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable. The food was not that good and the only option there was, was egg as they ran out of the other option which was chicken.

### "so presently surprised"
Toronto to Dublin return, and I was dreading flying with Air Canada rouge because of bad reviews, but I have never been so presently surprised. We flew premium economy as I had used some air miles. Everything was smooth, from check in to landing. The staff were lovely, the food was seriously some of the best airline food I've had. The seats were spacious and free iPad's provided for Premium Economy. I had specified that I wanted a Vegetarian meal, when the hostesses got to me they told me I could take the vegetarian option on the menu, or there was a specially prepared meal for me. On the way out from Toronto to Dublin I went for the specially prepared meal and had some sort of sweet potato curry with salad and a cheesecake. On the return flight the menu option which was a sun-dried tomato lasagne with pine nuts and olives, with salad and a lemon tart sounded too good to miss. The attendants were quick whenever a drink was requested and very polite. I would happily fly Air Canada rouge again, even in Economy class. Depending on the price difference I would opt for Premium due to the complimentary beverages, queue jump, wide comfy seats and leg room.

### "some inconsistencies"
The airline maybe budget, but noted some inconsistencies. The Toronto to Las Vegas flight had a USB and electric outlet between seats, allowing a recharge. The return flight did not - no plugs. No infotainment is also a major failure. No screens on seats. The staff announced that installing the Air Canada app would permit wifi, but apps drain extremely fast when streaming via wifi. And there are no plugs to charge devices. If using a PC you must install one of their flash versions as well as a 120-200Mb plugin. However, if the technology is not on the traveler's side, for $10 you can "rent" you an iPad. Food for purchase.

### "have improved considerably"
Third review of Air Rouge since it started. My first review I was very disappointed in Air Canada rouge and I was travelling Business Class. Second review it had improved seating so I gave it better marks. This time I flew premium economy and I was really impressed with how Air Canada rouge has pulled up their socks so to speak. Service was good, leg room amazing in premium economy - who needs business class, seriously almost as good and a fraction of the cost. I have avoided flying to Hawaii on Air Canada rouge because they only have red eyes on their return flights. Now if they could work on that and their hot meals I would given even higher scores. Air Canada rouge have improved considerably.

### "great customer service"
We had an amazing flight with Air Canada rouge from Las Vegas to Vancouver on Monday May 9th. The flight crew were truly amazing! Very helpful, friendly and professional. We were amazed when one of them suggested that we might be able to get my 9 year old son to visit the cockpit after the flight landed. It was an amazing experience, and the gave us an amazing experience that none of us will ever forget! It's been a while since we experienced such great customer service and we appreciate it!

### "shoved in like sardines"
We flew from Halifax to Toronto on Air Canada economy and had lots of leg room, TV and a charge port for cell phones. Then flying 7 hrs to Barcelona on Air Canada rouge Boeing 767 with no TV and we were shoved in like sardines. No one was happy. Lots of people I spoke to were upset with the plane. Same thing on the way home 8.5 hrs back to Toronto on the same plane, then Toronto to Halifax on the better one. Something wrong with this picture. Needless to say I will never fly Air Canada again.

### "flight was actually fine"
Took Air Canada rouge on a package vacation (via Air Canada Vacations) to Cuba and was dreading the trip, but I figured it's only a 3.5 hour flight, so just would have to make the best of it. However, despite all my trepidation, the flight was actually fine. Left on time both there and back, luggage delivered promptly. I fly AC regularly, but generally mainline, Trans-Pacific and the odd domestic flight. Despite the worries, I really did not have a problem with seat comfort, pitch or service. I knew what I was buying. For people complaining about seat width - you really don't have anything to complain about. Width is a standard 18 inches, try flying on an AC Boeing 787 for 13 plus hours in economy. Those are the latest and greatest AC planes and they have only 17.3 inch width. Seat pitch and leg room are not great, but bearable. In flight service and movies. I have an I-pad, so no problem and I don't care that much about entertainment on a 3.5 hour flight. So, all in all and compared to many other airlines in economy, it is not as bad as others would have you think.

### "Rouge was not as bad as I thought"
We were switched from AC mainline to Rouge for our flight to Barbados about 4 months before our departure. AC did not notify us of the change and as we were travelling as a family we had booked our seats in advance, long and behold after the switch to Rouge we were all scattered around the plane. After several complaints it is apparent AC could care less, a sentiment echoed across these boards and forums. After reading the horrible reviews of Rouge I was very anxious about the trip. We have two children (8 months and 2.5 years) and I am 6'3" and was very worried about the leg room and lack of in-flight entertainment. As a result I coughed up the $40 for a premium rouge seat (row 12) and as much as I hated paying extra it was worth every penny. I did have plenty of room for my legs and for my wife and I to tend to the kids with adequate space. Service on-board was quite good, FA's were younger however they were more pleasant than the old crusties I experience all the time with AC mainline. Inflight entertainment is non-existent as mentioned here so either cough up some $ for an ipad rental or bring your own device. Planes themselves are quite old however the interior has been updated and looks quite nice. AC service at the airport is deplorable. We arrived 3 hours before our flight and checked in online the night before. However when we went to print our luggage tags and boarding passes at the kiosk we were informed on screen we had to see an agent. This was due to our infant and AC requiring to verify the passport picture. We were in line for over two hours, yes two hours, with the kids in order to check our bags and see the agent. The line was full of other people who could have easily checked-in at the kiosk and checked their luggage separately. Why was AC not enforcing this? They just let anyone in the line, so what is the point of the kiosks. Anyway I asked two separate AC staff that our plane leaves within the hour and we need to feed the infant before we leave. They could not care less and just said back in line. After all this we made it to the gate with only 15 minutes to spare. I have been flying AC frequently for the past 10 years on business and for leisure, going forward I will explore every option to avoid them and opt for another airline such as WestJet. AC's horrible policies, shady practices of switching to Rouge and just a general disregard for their customers is plenty reason to avoid them. That being said Rouge itself was not as bad as I had thought it would be although we were on the larger 767 and not the airbus. If you are tall do yourself a favour and upgrade to premium rouge for $40.

### "overall a terrible flight"
Terrible experience with Air Canada rouge. I am 5' 10" and did not have nearly enough room to enjoy the flight from Toronto to Vegas. The seats were something that resembled a bench seat in an old truck - very uncomfortable. It close to an hour and twenty minutes before the flight attendants were able to make it all the way to the back of the plane with concessions due to the number of attendants/passenger and the fact that the people at the front of the economy section had to come all the way to the back of the plane to use the bathroom, therefore the attendants would have to pack up, move all the way to the back of the plane to let some people to the bathroom. We were also very disappointed that the entertainment system is now an iPod that you have to pay $10.00 for, a little ridiculous considering what we pay for tickets anyway. It was overall a terrible flight. The flight attendants have nothing to work with - too many factors working against them. Never again.

### "such a poor experience"
The whole experience with Air Canada rouge has been disappointing. First: we were on an intercontinental route (Las Vegas to Montreal to Munich to Torino) and no one had any idea about what we were supposed to do with our luggage, with the security control or with the border control. We were worried about that because of the layover time (which was very short) and we were afraid we couldn't make it. In the end we made it, but it has been a nightmare (we had to run through the whole airport, with no any help/info from anyone). Second: nothing to eat from Las Vegas to Montreal. They offered something to drink just once. Last: there was no entertainment on board - unless you purchased an ipad. Summing up: such a poor experience.

### "will opt for any other airline"
Another horrible Air Canada rouge flight from Toronto to Las Vegas. Have they pushed the seats even closer together? The flight attendants are trying their best, but nothing can make up for how uncomfortable the seats are. I fly for business to places south where Air Canada has figured it is mostly tourists - so who cares. The prices are not cheaper then when they flew regular Air Canada flights. I collect aeroplan points, but that last trip sealed it - I will opt for any other airline.

### "disappointed with the whole experience"
I was looking forward to flying with Air Canada rouge from Toronto to Montego Bay Jamaica but was very disappointed with the whole experience. The flight was delayed (not weather related). The seating was a joke, families were separated all over the plane. If you booked ahead you were put at the back of the plane and had no option to change your seat unless you paid more. The service onboard was terrible and the stewardess waited for people to come to them. Told one person who had been buzzing that she thought they hit it by mistake. They all just hung out at the back of the plane, I was in row 51 and could tell you all they did was talk to each other. If someone asked for something they made you feel like you where bothering them. The infighting enertament is so out dated.

### "seats are very narrow"
I took Air Canada rouge because I had a standby ticket from Montreal to Cancun and the return was from Cancun to Toronto and onwards to Montreal. The online check in was easy. The flights were full and the seats are very narrow, my knee was touching the seat in front of me when it was inclined. The passenger behind me and next to me were also very annoyed of the lack of legroom. The cabin crew on both legs were fine but nothing special. The service consisted of complimentary soft  drinks and overprice meals for purchase by credit card. Inflight entertainment was through the APP on a smartphone, tablet or laptop. I had some trouble to navigate and load the application at the beggining but afterwards it went fine however there's no charging ports on board. There was also tablets available to rent for a fee. The last leg on the return flight on the mainline was much better and it was one of their newest Boeing 787 aircraft. Air Canada rouge should become more like the mainline. It's a big mistake that they downgraded the product on leisure destinations. I would not recommend unless if you want to travel cheap.

### "disappointment was baggage"
Flew Toronto to Phoenix, AZ. While the seats were very tight with hardly any leg room, my biggest disappointment was with the baggage. I purposely packed carry-on so I could avoid checking a bag. However when we got to the gate, they asked people to check bags as it was a full flight and ensured us that we would get them off first (along with getting seated prior to economy boarding). Those of us checking our bags were told to leave them in the 'tunnel' just before getting on the plane. When we arrived in Phoenix, none of the bags that were checked last minute made it onto the plane. The Air Canada agent that was at the baggage claim in Phoenix was very inconsiderate and repeatedly told us to wait (even though we had all been waiting over an hour at this point). We all filled out forms for our bags to be delivered to our destinations. Very disappointed with Air Canada rouge.

### "not paying $15 seat selection"
Air Canada rouge from Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. The worst was not the cramped seats, but the way that the airline breaks up families who travels together. My wife was assigned four rows behind me. My son was 30 rows back at the very end of the plane. All these to punish us for not paying the $15 seat selection!

### "staff was fantastic"
I was not impressed with Air Canada rouge. Very small plane and the seats were uncomfortable. I was placed in front of the emergency exit where my knees touched the seats in front of me, and the chairs in this section did not have the option to recline. Whenever the seat in front of me would recline I couldn't move. There was no free meal. However, staff was fantastic. Also there were no TV's, you had to download an app to be able to watch any movie or TV. However when I tried to download the app before take off, it wouldn't let me connect to any wifi so I could not use the service, unless I paid for an iPad rental.

### "the lack of seat room"
We departed from Calgary on Air Canada an A319 connecting in Vancouver onto Air Canada rouge B767. The short flight from Calgary to Vancouver was very comfortable, good seat room, even had entertainment screen. The long flight had no entertainment. The worst part for me was the lack of seat room. I am not overly big, (96'0" - 185 lbs) but my knees were pressing against the seat in front the entire way. Service is bare bones. No problem with crew or checking in, in fact had a very helpful Air Canada lady in Calgary airport help us get our boarding passes. We were extremely disappointed that there would be no entertainment for a 6 hour plus flight and yet there was between Calgary and Vancouver. However, the real deal breaker is the lack of seat room - we won't be flying Air Canada Rouge again.

### "exceeded our expectations"
Toronto to Bridgetown. When Air Canada started the Rouge service I had my doubts. I must say that they have exceeded our expectations. The flight crew is friendly and helpful, the planes are new, and having movies on your iPad is much better than the old monitor in the seat. All around I have to say this flight and previous flights with Rouge have been better than the regular Air Canada flights.

### "regular budget airline"
Montreal to Varader with Air Canada rouge - regular budget airline. Nothing special to complain, but also nothing to congratulate. Even drinks were offered, but everything else was for purchase including earphones. They have a good system of inflight entertaiment with WiFi signal and you can use your device.

### "somewhat pleasantly surprised"
I was not expecting much from Air Canada rouge, and was somewhat pleasantly surprised with my flight from Cancun to Montreal. The pane was new and clean, flight crew was good, although even on an international flight, only soft drinks, juice, water are complimentary. Anything else has a price. My main complaint is the cramped seating, narrow, thin cushions, and minimum leg room. Fine if you are less than 5 feet tall and weight less than 100 pounds. If the inconsiderate person in front of you reclines their seat, claustrophobia results. If airlines want to cram more seats in their planes, with even less space, they should limit or eliminate recline.

### "professional and pleasant"
From the start of this flight to the time of landing in Vancouver  Air Canada was professional and pleasant to deal with. One flight attendant was notably great at his job and seemed to genuinely care about passengers and their comfort. Air Canada will definitely get the nod for future travels .

### "have noticed improvements"
I had a great trip to Mexico last week thanks to Rouge. I have travelled with Rouge before to Hawaii and in a year I have noticed improvements in service and product. The staff were great - friendly, available but not hovering. The food was tasty and hot, and the seat was comfortable. Yes, you get what you pay for with this airline. Having said that, Rouge does provide a competitive product out there that is comparible to other airlines. The only thing the airline needs to be up front with is which airline you fly on, the main Air Canada or Air Canada Rouge.

### "flight attendants were clueless"
Our Orlando to Toronto flight was delayed by about 45 minutes. Got to our seats to find crumbs all over the seats and floor. Not a big issue wiping it off. All they served was pop, juice or water. No small snacks offered for free. Onboard entertainment was awful. Tried following the 3 simple instructions to install a plug-in in order to watch a movie. Ended up fiddling around for about 45 minutes and still did not work. Called for help and flight attendants were clueless about their own entertainment system. Said one of their staff members could help and gave me a fake smile. At the end, no one came to help. Luckily, we flew on points.

### "service crew unfriendly"
Flew Air Canada rouge from Toronto to Barbados. Inflight service crew unfriendly - did not see them smile once until passengers were leaving the plane. Both flights I had to endure other passengers watching movies on their devices without head phones/ear buds at a loud volume, not acceptable, or enjoyable, not my place to confront the passenger. Disappointed flyer.

### "so close together"
Run don't walk from any flight on Air Canada Rouge. I've flown it a couple of times and the service, seats and entertainment are terrible. On a recent trip to Cancun from Montreal, there was no water in any of the economy bathrooms. They didn't even provide water bottles for washing your hands. The seats are so close together, you become very intimate with the seat in front of you. There is no entertainment unless you want to rent one of their tables or download an app to watch on yours.

### "seats were so comfortable"
Toronto to Varadero, Cuba return with Air Canada rouge. This was our first premium class flight anywhere. Our hostess on flight #1986 on January 24th was rather crusty, but this wasn't going to ruin our experience. The food was excellent, the seats were so comfortable, and it was very quiet in our area. We were given tablets to enjoy movies. On the flight home, #1987 on February 7th, our airline host addressed us by name with a smile and was efficient and friendly. We had the best meal we've ever had on an airplane (chicken with rice and a sauce that was to die for, an arugula and kale salad and a brownie, plus excellent wine), on china with cutlery and a linen napkin. We had warm cashews with a beverage to begin with, and snacks to follow lunch. The cost of this flight was well worth the money. We are so spoiled now that we don't want to go back to economy ever!

### "very old and dirty"
Flew Air Canada rouge from Los Angeles to Calgary. I'm not usually claustrophobic but when I'm sitting perfectly straight up and my knees are still touching the seat in front of me it is very uneasy. The plane was also very old and dirty. We also tried to select seats in advance and were given a $15 charge for standard seats. I've never heard of charging customers to select standard seats before.

### "excellent customer service"
Punta Cana to Montreal. I had reserved seats prior which I paid for prior to getting on the plane. The representative at the ticket counter refused to change anyone for me and my family and seated a couple of rows from the back. Since it was a late flight my kids were tired and my daughter wanted to sit with me instead of my husband. As I was seated next to 2 other people she couldn't, so I saw the last row was empty. I asked the flight attendants if I could sit there with my daughter and they said of course. The flight attendants that were working on this flight were excellent. Always smiling! My kids wanted water they brought it right away without them waiting which was fabulous. They helped me avoid my children nagging! I would love to have them on any of my flights! Excellent customer service!

### "4.5 hours and still waiting"
Montreal to Cayo Coco. I've been sitting in this airport since 3.30am, my flight was supposed to be at 6 am. The flight has been delayed due to technical problems, and has been re scheduled twice - still waiting to depart for Cuba. I can't believe Air Canada rouge has no back up plans, and we have no staff here to inform us of how much longer we wait. we were told it takes one hour to change the part, it's been 4.5 hours and we are still waiting.

### "do not expect much"
I have now flown Air Canada Rouge twice in the past two months. First to Las Vegas and then to Fort Lauderdale. The boarding of the passengers is chaotic and completely disorganized partly due to the passengers waiting in line for their zone to be called. Once inside the plane do not expect much. The seats are narrow with thin cushions, not very comfortable, leg room is poor, especially for passengers taller than 5'6". The inflight entertainment is poor, with not many choices at all of watching recent movie releases. That is if the wifi is working, which sometimes is not. The stewards try to do their best, but there are very few of them. My flight was delayed 3.5 hours, with no notification. In fact, I found out it was delayed 6 hours before departure. This is the third year in a row that the same flight from Fort Lauderdale to Toronto has been delayed. There are about 5-6 flights departing or arriving in a span of 1.5 hrs: a built-in delay. What are you offered: $10 voucher. Overhead carry-on storage space is tight and you will be lucky to find space above your seat. Consider a non-rouge flight or another airline.

### "staff was very friendly"
Toronto to Barbados with Air Canada rouge. Check in was fantastic, nobody there and staff was very friendly. Lots of legroom in Premium Rouge but didn't really find much room in the seats and they weren't that comfortable. Overall cost was not worth it. Food was okay but the same idea as what was served in the Lounge.

### "service was attentive"
Canadians are generally a fantastically polite and nice people and this translated into the service onboard this Air Canada rouge flight from Cancun to Toronto. The announcements by flight deck and cabin crew were impeccable with a certain level of Canadian charm. The Senior cabin crew member was fantastic and the service was attentive. Seats were acceptably comfortable for a 4 hour flight. Entertainment choices to stream were good quality.

### "attendants were amazing"
Have to give a extra shout out to the Air Canada rouge flight attendants on our adventure with 10 other friends! We were on flight 1774 on January 31st from Toronto to Samaná, Dominican Republic. The attendants were amazing and so friendly, and just kept smiling!They deserve big hugs and pats on the back! Our whole experience was just wonderful for such a large gang! From start to finish very impressive even when a computer clinch happened! Keep up the good work.

### "tried it 14 times now"
We've booked a vacation to Cancun and our tickets have been issued, but there is no way to get in touch with the right people at Air Canada rouge. All I want to do is book our seats to make certain we get the most leg room possible, but we've been trying for 5 days without success. It can't be done on line for some reason - according to their website (always did this with other airlines), The web page won't recognize our reservation confirmation number, and although they have a toll free number for seat bookings, I've tried it 14 times now and always get the message that there is a high volume of calls and am instructed to hang up to call back later. It is now day 5 that I've been trying to reach them and still no success. I tried sending an email and got no response either. Our vacation is not looking very promising and we haven't even gotten off the ground yet.

### "will avoid like the plague"
Las Vegas to Vancouver, and I've never been more uncomfortable and I've flown Ryanair. This was after Air Canada Rouge piped up a week before departure as they had decided to change our flight from the 1pm LAS-YVR to the 7am LAS-YVR. Then the flight was delayed by 3 hours? Fantastic, glad I woke up at 4am for that. To add further injury, the flight wasn't overly cheap. Only took it because it was direct as opposed to others that went via SEA, SFO or LAX. Hindsight being the grand thing it is, I should have tackled the labyrinth that is LAX for an hour stop and flown an airline that caters to people human sized. Will avoid Air Canada Rouge like the plague.

### "little space between seats"
Toronto to Punta Cana return. I understand that Air Canada rouge is a discount airline but that should not mean cheap and poor service. We flew to the Dominican Republic in January 2016. The counter service at both airports was pretty good. But once on the airplane, it is a different story. I don’t blame the flight attendants, there is not enough of them. On the flight back, there were 4 of them: two to look after the few seats in the upper class service and two for the rest of a large plane. The seats are atrocious. Your knees are in the seat in front of you. If Air Canada Rouge is going to give so little space between the seats, make sure the seats can’t recline. On the way to the Dominican Republic, the beverage service came once (4.5 hour flight). The cup they give is so small that you basically have 1 sip. I asked if I could get the whole can of coke and the flight attendant said no because they did not have enough of them. The entertainment system is an absolute joke. You have to use your own device and the Air Canada app. That is not bad in itself. But the choice of entertainment was completely substandard. The choices of movies included Flashdance (1983) and the Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). The TV shows were mostly from the 70s and 80s. There was absolutely nothing recent and worth watching. Nickle and dime for everything. Pay for the luggage, pay for the food. Why not charge $35 more for the ticket and include the luggage ($25.00) and the meal ($10.00). Maybe even a whole can of coke and a bottle of water!

### "most uncomfortable flight"
Toronto to Puerto Plata was the most uncomfortable flight I have experienced. I'm 5'11" and my knees were pressed against the seat in front of me. The seats are hard and uncomfortable for anything but a short flight. We connected to a regular Air Canada flight after arriving in Toronto, so were able to immediately compare the comfort level. Based on comfort, regular Air Canada is far superior to Air Canada Rouge. Will not fly Rouge again.

### "a pay for affair"
I've flown a lot for both work and pleasure (Star Alliance Gold) but have seldom experienced an outfit like Air Canada Rouge. Whilst there was nothing wrong with the staff or the aircraft per se, what kind of organisation does not offer a pillow, blanket or food on an 6 hours overnight flight from Honolulu to Vancouver? I've travelled in both economy and premium and as far as I can see there is no difference in service or provision and even if you take advantage of the snack menu which is a pay for affair, it is only a snack menu. Also if you don't download their app to your phone or tablet then there is no inflight entertainment unless you rent a tablet from them for USD 10 however I think that option is only available to business class passengers however may be wrong. Frankly if there is another option then I would suggest considering it and if not then, bring your own food and warm clothes.

### "24 hours stranded in the airport"
Refreshed from our vacation Air Canada Rouge 1828 (Kahului - Toronto) had us board the last flight of the night at 11.20 pm only to be told there was an air conditioning leak so all 300 or more passengers then had to disembark. Passengers were told to be patient as they would slowly but surely all be taken care of and taken to hotels for the night. By 5am after "Elite" class, families with small children and seniors were finally taken care of the remaining 75 or so remaining passengers were told that there were no rooms left and we would have to stay in the airport. We were offered $10 vouchers to cover 2 meals. That is $5 per meal. Nowhere to sleep but on the dirty, hard floor. One passenger finally asked for a blanket. A few got at least that. What happened next is amazing to me, the Air Canada contracted staff left. We were then left to figure out when our next flight might be which came to us through going online, not cheap to do with no wfi service at Kahului Airport. Not a single Air Canada staff member showed their face until boarding that night at 9pm. Almost 24 hours stranded in the airport. Had they at least taken our contact information we could have went out for the day but since we had no idea of when our next flight might depart it was not a good idea. If you don't mind being left to fend for yourself on a cold floor, very little food and service that blatantly disregards your basic needs, fly Air Canada.

### "airport staff rude"
Las Vegas to Montreal with Air Canada rouge - airport staff are rude. The inflight staff were ok but didn't go out of their way to make the flight pleasant. We had empty cups and wrapping for the entire duration of the flight. Overhead store small therefore an average carry-on does not fit. Even though the flights are cheaper, I will never fly Air Canada rouge again.

### "lack of courtesy and willingness"
Today I boarded Air Canada rouge flight 1863 from MCO (Orlando) to YYZ (Toronto). I am 7 months pregnant, and was travelling with a 2 year old daughter, and my husband. We travelled with 4 carry-on bags, and one stroller which we checked at the gate. We boarded in the pre-boarding period for passengers with small children. Upon arrival to the airplane, I was carrying my duffel bag and my 2 year old daughter was in my other arm. I was standing at the entranceway to one of the first-class aisles (the airplane had a 2-3-2 seating configuration in Economy), and there was one woman in front of me. The flight attendant in that aisle was helping a passenger to load a bag into the upper compartment. Following this, she allowed the woman in front of me to pass her. She then proceeded to load another passenger's bag into a compartment. After this, she was asked by another passenger, to stow their jacket in a compartment. At this point in time, I asked if I could pass. She requested that I wait. I then informed her that I am both pregnant and carrying a toddler. The flight attendant then proceeded to stow the jacket instead of offering me passage through the aisle. I chose to pass her before she could stow the jacket as I was tired from carrying both my bag and my daughter. Following take-off, this flight attendant found me in economy class, and proceeded to lecture me and stated that my actions were inappropriate. She then informed me that if I required assistance that I should have boarded during pre-boarding for individuals with children who required assistance. I informed her, that I did board during this period. The flight attendant at this point walked away. This flight was the 6th flight I have travelled since having my daughter (4 with Porter, 1 with WestJet and this last one with Air Canada). Never before have I experienced such a lack of courtesy and willingness to help a passenger who required assistance. On my previous flights with Porter and WestJet, flight attendants have made an expressed point of offering assistance upon seeing me with my daughter. Today's experience was the complete opposite.

### "quickly offered assistance"
My 93 yr. old mother took ill while vacationing in California so I had to fly her home to Vancouver. Although they didn't offer the chance to take an earlier flight than planned, the Air Canada staff at both LAX and YVR were most helpful. They quickly offered assistance in transporting her and fast tracking us through security etc. It was very a very stressful trip for me but was made so much easier because of the kindness shown by staff.

### "never been more disappointed"
I have never been more disappointed with a flight/airline as I was with Air Canada Rouge. The flight from Kelowna to Toronto was significantly delayed due to weather which is not and was not an issue. Unexplained delay to boarding. However, the additional delay to board after the plane was on the ground was not adequately explained. Our flight was originally scheduled to leave at 12.25. It was after 4.00 when we finally got in the air. For convenience travelling with an infant we chose to sit at the back of the plane. By the time the flight attendants served us here was no food other than chips, chocolate bars, nuts or granola bars. We were informed that the ground crew did not load enough meals. Another airline had the courtesy of informing it's passengers about the lack of entertainment system and advised passengers to bring a book with them. Why could we not have been notified that there would not be proper food items? We did not land in Toronto until after midnight and the availability to get proper nutrition was again limited at that hour. Poor entertainment choices - This airline no longer has an entertainment system installed and requires you bring your own tablet and they provide wi-fi to view movies they have pre selected. The movie selection was poor and very out of date. I am 5'9", sitting in the regular economy was extremely uncomfortable due to the limited leg room. Thank goodness there was an empty seat between my daughter and I. Otherwise this flight would have bordered on unbearable. Flight attendants were very gracious. I fly a moderate amount and have flown with many different airlines and plane styles. This is unfortunately the first time I have felt compleled to write a negative review.

### "seats are just too small"
This is the fourth time flying with Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to San Jose, Costa Rica and my first review. This is a very uncomfortable plane to ride in, especially if you are a larger than average human. I always pick a window seat when I travel because an aisle seat puts me midway into the aisle and am constantly jostled by people and or carts throughout the trip. Thank goodness my wife is small so she takes the middle seat and I take the window and we make it work. Bottom line is the seats in the Rouge fleet are just too small and too close together. I cannot sit down without putting one leg into my wife's designated area as the seat in front is too close and on business trips where I am flying solo, I am much more cramped and even at that it is very difficult to fit in there and it is infringing on a stranger's personal space. The seat is also very narrow and uncomfortable (hard seat cushion) and also there is no entertainment centre so a 5 hour flight seems like an eternity. For future travel I will book with a different airline if possible. I don't mind the regular Air Canada planes and will happily fly on them but Rouge will be my last choice in the future. I typically fly for business five to six times a year and for leisure a couple or more times per year so on average take a flight about once a month and usually a three hour or more leg is involved at least twice per round trip.

### "paying more for less"
Our return flight from Barbados to Toronto was changed from Air Canada to Air Canada rouge (no option) starting in 2016. We paid the same price for both fares. We were not aware that we needed to download the AC app to use the entertainment option. We purchased an iPad but the battery ran out before the flight ended and there were no plugs to charge devices. We purchased food, iPad and received our customs forms at the beginning of the flight then we saw the flight attendants again before the flight landed when they offered water. We paid the same price for our Air Canada Ticket from Toronto to Barbados and our Air Canada Rouge Ticket from Barbados to Toronto then paid additional fees for baggage and entertainment units, sat in smaller, less comfortable seats, received less service on Air Canada Rouge. Air Canada Rouge is a promoting itself as a discount airline; why are we paying more for less?

### "very uncomfortable seating"
Our Air Canada rouge flight from Toronto to Sarasota was to leave at 4pm on January 12. When we boarded the first plane we were told shortly after boarding, that the Sarasota airport was not able to handle the plane's equipment, but not to worry, there was another plane waiting for us at another gate. We all got off, and went to another gate / plane. At that time we were told the second plane was "off line" for maintenance issues. We would have to wait for a third plane to take us, but this plane was in Jamaica, and was running one hour late (despite Air Canada have dozens of aircraft sitting in Toronto). Around 9pm we boarded an A319, which was very clean. The seats are most uncomfortable. I am 5 11" and barely fit into the seats. If the passenger in front of you reclines their seat, you are doomed to hours of discomfort. When you buy tickets on Air Canada rouge, you still pay the regular Air Canada price, so you pay for a normal seat, but get a budget airline. There is no entertainment system (eg movies). The flight staff crew are young, and seem discouraged by passenger comments on the poor quality of the aircraft. Summary, full price tickets, late and delayed flights on older aircraft, very uncomfortable seating. If you can avoid flying Rouge, you will be better off for it.

### "didn't get my pre-paid meal"
Montreal to Las Vegas flight was delayed, we changed gate three times and apparently they forgot the food. I didn't get my pre-paid meal, I paid extra for a larger seat but was given a smaller one, and a male flight attendant was so rude. There was no TV for the 5 hour flight but you could rent a iPad if you have a credit card - otherwise your out of luck. After complaining via email for 4 months because they don't have a phone, they send me a $100 unusable gift certificate.

### "worst flying experience"
Air Canada Rouge is probably the worst flying experience I have had. The seats are narrow and minimal leg room. I am 6', have short legs, and was extremely uncomfortable for the duration of my 5 hour flight. The seats are streamlined, which basically means less padding on them, so my body also got very sore from sitting on the seats. There is no in-flight entertainment, unless you bring your own tablet and download the app. I tried to download the app for my laptop, but the website was so confusing (and I am good with computers) that I could not find a way to download it. Prior to takeoff, a father was walking his approximately 3 year old daughter to the washroom, because she clearly needed to go. Just as he was about to go into the washroom, the flight attendant stopped him, informed him he needed to be seated for takeoff, and made him sit down. He politely complied. His daughter was obviously distraught, and began to cry. I felt bad for him, but figured we would be taking off soon, and that within 15 minutes she should be able to go. But about 10 minutes later, we still hadn't moved, and he asked another flight attendant if he could quickly take her, and was again informed that they have to follow protocol, and he could not take her to the washroom. Another 10 minutes passed, we still had not moved from the gate, and this time the passenger on the other side of his daughter asked a different flight attendant for him, and got the same response. In the 30 minutes we were sitting waiting to leave the gate, she probably could have went to the washroom at least 10 times! The flight left 30 minutes delayed and eventually she made it to the washroom. The point is for the employees of the airline to be able to communicate with the pilots and find out that we would be delayed, and then adjust their protocol to accommodate a suffering child. But that experience just about sums up my experience with this airline.

### "uncomfortable seats"
My family flew Air Canada Rouge from Vancouver to Maui, and from Maui to Vancouver. I have been a regular customer of Air Canada for many, many years and was shocked Air Canada offered flights with such low levels of quality. Old planes, with uncomfortable seats, seats are too narrow, no leg room (we had exit row bulk head seats and could not stretch our legs - this was very uncomfortable for a 5 hour flight). No entertainment available, and beverages were offered only at the commencement of our flight. This is a rip-off for Aeroplan customers and for anyone paying regular fares. There is no price difference offered to customers between regular Air Canada flights and AC Rouge. Only AC Rouge to US west coast (exception is California, where there is still a choice on certain flights), Hawaii, and now the Caribbean. Air Canada does not fly its regular planes to these destinations. For our family, decision is obvious: no more flying with Air Canada Rouge.

### "room for legs is short"
Quebec to San José on Air Canada rouge, the room for your legs is short. I'm 6.1 ft, it was a 5 hour flight and I did not have room for my legs. Air Canada rouge have their entertaiment via your mobile or you rent a Ipad for 10$, but we the seats have no power source to charge mobile or laptop, so if I watch a movie my phone will drain. I don't recommand this company, and I probably won't use it another time.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My wife and I were on our honeymoon and were looking forward to this new Air Canada rouge service but everything went wrong. To begin with, the inbound flight (Toronto to Lima) was 40 minutes late and, therefore, so was our flight to Toronto on that day. The moment we entered the plane we noticed that the cleaning had not been done properly. The plane (a 14 year-old Boeing 767-300) still had the seats of its former carrier (Kenya Airways) and it was hot. No entertainment system (I had to rent an Ipad for CAD10) and the seat pitch very tight.

### "responsiveness to our situation"
This review is a combination of a complaint and a compliment. We flew to Santa Clara on Air Canada Rouge as party of an Air Canada Vacations package. First the complaint - prior to boarding the flight back to Toronto at Santa Clara Airport, my wife, my daughter and I were called to the counter and were advised that we had been upgraded to first class from our assigned seats in economy just behind the wings. We had been bumped up to first class when we checked in for our flight to Santa Clara a week earlier, and could not believe it had happened again. Alas, it was indeed too good to be true, because as we were boarding our Toronto flight, we were advised that we were now in the very last row in economy. The staff seemed to be confused as to why this happened. It was most disconcerting for us, and we asked why we had not just been re-assigned our original seats. In fact, it was apparent that several mistakes had been made in re-assigning seats, since the plane was delayed for over an hour because the passenger manifest didn't tally with the re-assigned seating and the resulting number of passengers. We complained to the flight attendants, who tried to explain the situation; however, there was nothing they could do to give us our original assigned seats. We noted that the seat changes were only marked in ink on our boarding passes by the ground staff, and, therefore, were not registered in the data system. I would suggest that there needs to be some effort or retraining of staff to ensure that staff actions are properly communicated and coordinated to avoid such situations in the future. Now the compliment - the staff, the senior FA, as well as the other two FAs went above and beyond the call in extending to me and my family some very generous compensatory offerings, including a full complementary meal, wine and free iPads for movies. We really appreciated their responsiveness to our situation.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Los Angeles to Vancouver on Air Canada rouge. Airport kiosk check-in was a breeze, as was boarding. Our flight was delayed by 20 minutes due to a passenger 'no show'. The captain informed us the reason for the delay but we still arrived at our destination on time. Cabin crew were efficient, courteous and helpful. We had ample room in economy, and whilst my 6'4" husband was a little squashed, he did not assume the foetal position. We weren't interested in food or inflight entertainment for such a short trip. My only negative feedback was the PA system. We could hear the captain quite well but announcements by cabin crew were barely audible (a potential safety issue). I'm also astounded by the amount of excessive/large baggage some passengers bring on board (obviously to avoid checked baggage charges). Otherwise, a very pleasant flight.

### "pleasant and professional service"
Fort Lauderdale to Toronto, and excellent service through Air Canada rouge. Commendation sent to the airline for the pleasant and professional service received by the Flight Attendants on this flight. Thank you to everyone that provided an excellent journey. I will continue to use and endorse Air Canada rouge.

### "seats too close for comfort"
Punta Cana to Toronto was the worst flying experience I have had. I am a regular Air Canada customer (back and front) but the seats on Air Canada rouge were way too close for comfort. I am not bilingual but even I was embarrassed with how the flight attendant butchered the French messaging. Most positive thing was the smooth landing in Toronto by the pilot. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Also didn't care for the in flight entertainment system (or movie choices) even though I packed along my own iPad.

### "seats are terribly close"
Phoenix to Toronto on Air Canada rouge was the most uncomfortable flight I've taken. Seats are terribly close, no TV screens and have to pay to rent ipads or use from your own device. Not ideal for a flight that runs 4.5 hours. Not impressed. Too small a plane for this type of travel. Especially after paying the amount of money we did on our flights.

### "it turned out alright"
Air Canada Rouge from Montreal to Las Vegas return. After a very smooth check-in, the outbound flight departed and arrived on time despite a snowstorm in Montreal. On board, the aircraft was recently refurbished and looked in pristine condition. After takeoff we were offered beverages and snacks for purchase followed by rental of onboard iPads. We had brought our own devices so turned down the rental offer. Despite repeated attempts and having the most up to date app., neither my wife nor I was able to download any of the movies. When the FA noticed this he offered us free iPads for the duration of the flight. We had exit row seats and had plenty of legroom but a quick glance at the rest of the economy cabin confirmed what many of the reviewers complained about - very cramped seating. There were two rounds of drinks offered interspersed with several water runs. The return flight was a carbon copy of the outbound leg although the FA's were not as warm and welcoming as the first leg and the check-in in Las Vegas was extremely slow even in the priority lane. This configuration of the A321 has only 3 restrooms in economy right at the back of the aircraft. This resulted in long queues for the entire duration especially when FA's were coming around with trolleys. This was our first experience with AC Rouge and on the balance it turned out alright. That said, I would not want to be crammed into regular seats for a 5-hour flight.

### "greatly reduced quality "
I have flown with Air Canada many times as a frequent flyer to Asia, Europe, and Florida. I loved flying with Air Canada as the service was great, the planes had good entertainment systems, lots of seat room and there was power at the seats. I booked flight passes to Florida and found out that the planes would be Air Canada rouge instead of Air Canada. You are paying the same price for an Air Canada flight with a budget airline. On the first flight the flight was delayed over 2 hours due to mechanical problems. The plane was an old plane that had been gutted with new seats (equating to less leg room and no entertainment system). The most recent flight was the worst. In Business class normally the flight attendant gives you water or juice right away, it took about 15 minutes. There were only 4 people in business class and my husband and I were told that only one of us could get the meal that we wanted. The other couple was served their meal. We waited about 20 minutes and then the attendant came with one meal and it wasn't the one we didn't want. She said she had made a mistake and that the one meal we wanted was not available. I said I would eat the other meal and she gave my husband the menu for the main cabin and asked if he wanted anything on it and also said that a beef dinner was available but it wouldn't be ready for 20 minutes. She explained that meals had been under catered. When my husbands meal arrived he asked why we hadn't gotten napkins and rolls. After a while we finally got paper napkins and rolls. The meal was presented in a manner similar to Air Canada economy meals rather than a business class meal (except for the hot meal, it was on a plate). The salad on the menu was not available. My husband complained about the poor service and the attendant did not handle it well. She said it wasn't her fault and felt that she shouldn't be blamed for the catering issue. When we arrived there was no gate available. Given the apparent problems (mechanical causing delays) with rouge flights this seems to be causing problems with other flights coming in to FLL. We waited on the tarmac for an hour before the plane was able to dock. When we went to get our luggage as we were the only passengers with checked priority luggage we expected our luggage to come out first. We had to wait along with the other passengers for our luggage. Unfortunately we have 4 more flights that we have prepaid for with Air Canada and will be forced to take Rouge flights. My opinion is that this was the stupidest decision that Air Canada could have made was to introduce Rouge. You are being charged the same as for an Air Canada flight with greatly reduced quality (ie budget) I definitely will not being flying Air Canada Rouge again. I'd rather fly with another budget airline that provides friendly and quality service. I'd rather fly on an Air Canada plane but that's not going to be possible.

### "very disappointing"
I was a flight attendant for Zoom Airlines for 5 years. During my career as a flight attendant, I learned a great deal about treating passengers with respect and remaining courteous as you never know someone's reason for travel. Travelling with Air Canada rouge from Tampa TO Toronto on my way home with my husband was very disappointing. We were not seated together at checkin. While waiting in the lounge in TPA, we inquired with the gate representatives who advised us to return to the counter in 5 minutes. After 10 minutes, I returned to the desk to ask if we could possibly see what the possibility of sitting together would be. I was told yet again to return in 5 minutes. My husband approached the desk 10 minutes later and was also told to come back. We waited until boarding, not wanting to bother them any longer and as the rep scanned my boarding pass, I asked her again and she didn't even look at me but muttered "no nothing we can do". Upon boarding the plane, I politely asked the flight attendant if we could be seated together and her response was "oh we don't do that, just ask around". I was stunned. Not only had we already been shunned in the waiting area to board, but now a second person refused to even consider helping us. We just got married and wanted to sit together, not a difficult thing to do. This was unprofessional and several passengers had turned their heads in awe. In all my years as a flight attendant, I never would have considered behaving in such a manner, refusing to help passengers, not to mention speaking in such an offensive way for all to hear. We have a vast selection of air carriers to choose from, and I will not be traveling with this carrier again.

### "seats horribly uncomfortable"
Vancouver to Toronto on Air Canada modern Boeing 777 aircraft with mature, attentive crew. After a 4 hour layover I boarded a Air Canada Rouge Boeing 767ER that was in need of an upgrade. The seats were horribly uncomfortable hardly reclined and had no entertainment system. An hour and a half after takeoff the young crew that seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves made an appearance to serve meals which was terrible. I asked for a glass of red wine with my dinner and the attendant asked for $6.75. Throughout the flight I was not offered an alcoholic beverage. Old aircraft with uncomfortable seats combined with inexperienced young cabin crew.

### "seats uncomfortable as hell"
Unlike a lot of Canadians, I've always generally been pretty happy with Air Canada. That is until flying Air Canada Rouge. Let me start off by focussing on the positives: they got me to my destination and the cabin crew were very nice; oh, and you get a blanket and pillow. The negatives: poor service started right in the airport. Despite checking in online and being told via the website I could drop my bag at the bag drop, there was no bag drop and I had to wait behind about a hundred people, mostly checking in. Good thing I was in plenty if time, but I'd planned to spend my time having a decent breakfast before boarding, not standing in line for half an hour. The seats on the Boeing 767-300 were like torture devices - uncomfortable as hell for a transatlantic flight. You pay $1,000 for a 7 hour flight and you don't even get a small free bottle of wine or a beer? The food was poor. No seat-back entertainment means, in practice, no entertainment. My older iPad doesn't have the right operating system and the idea of paying $10 more to rent (if available) an iPad hundreds of other people have had their fingers all over isn't very appealing. I do not recommend them and after my flight back to Ireland I won't fly them again.

### "seem to be improving"
This our third time flying Air Canada Rouge and they seem to be improving. We were in Preferred seating 17 A/C. The flight attendants were professional and attentive. We noted some changes to the uniform which was nice to see. There is no entertainment system and one has to download the AC app., or pay for the use of an IPOD for $10.00 which is really a waste of time as there is very little worth watching. Our prepaid snack was just OK, nothing special. The aircraft is really showing its age. The carpet on the floor was very dirty and lifting in our area. Gum noted on the floor in our seating area. The seats were somewhat uncomfortable for a bigger person. Albeit we were sitting in preferred seating. I took the opportunity to sit in the regular economy seats to see the difference. Yes there is a cramped feeling as documented by other reviewers. AC Rouge is considered a discount off shoot of mainline Air Canada. I am taken aback by this statement as the price was equal if not higher than what other airlines flying via US carriers and for that matter West Jet. We flew down with United Airlines preferred seating. We had a pillow, blanket, earphones entertainment system provided. AC Rouge you were required to pay for these items if you were lucky enough to get them.

### "customer service was terrible"
Very bad experience flying from Montreal to Rome with Air Canada Rouge. 9 hr flight on an old plane with no displays on the back of the seats, like it was in the 90's. Entertainment was only available if you downloaded the aircanada app on your personal apple device prior to the flight, but we couldn't do this as nobody had advised us in time to download it. Cabin crew young and inexperienced. They were terribly rude, especially to non French speakers. I asked for some paper tissue and the flight attendant told me to go and get it myself from the toilet. Customer service was terrible. Food below average.

### "exceeded our expectations"
I am a regular Air Canada flyer and was terrified to fly Air Canada Rouge from YVR to OGG after reading all the reviews. From the time we checked in, Air Canada Rouge exceeded our expectations. The seats were comfortable with more then adequate leg room. The flight was full however it did not feel like it. The cabin crew were kind, helpful and courteous. Beverage service happened twice and with the Air Canada Rouge Cafe buy on board we had an excellent selection of things to purchase. The Air Canada Rouge App had great selection of movies and TV shows. I like that I could use my own personal smartphone and iPad. The cabin offers a standard plug in for devices to keep them charged. Reading other reviews makes me think traveller's did not read about how Air Canada Rouge works with inflight entertainment and services, they expected an Air Canada flight. The airline even emails you to ensure you are aware of the inflight services and entertainment. There are no excusses to complain about it. I would recommend Air Canada Rouge as a discount airline.

### "a lovely flight"
Toronto to Orlando with Air Canada rouge. It was a lovely flight. No frills flying with a little extra space and a great staff. Ended up in the seat in front of the mid-cabin washrooms - was a great bonus! The only negative was a thirty-plus minute delay. We were served by a wonderful flight attendant, and we travelled with a lap enfant.

### "inflight service was excellent"
Air Canada Premium Rouge, well worth the extra cost, priority check in, extra baggage allowance, free seat selection and access to the Maple Leaf Lounge. On board service in the new (12) seat configuration gives you a lot of legroom, inflight service was excellent, prompt beverage and meal service, crews were very courteous and professional, both flights to and from Cuba were excellent.

### "seats so close together"
In addition to this flight, we travelled return to Los Angeles in October. My complaint is in the seats and how close together they are. I am a fit middle-aged 6'1" male. In both flights my knees were hard up against the seat in front of me and I cannot extend my legs under the seat in front of me. In addition to this, if the person in front of me reclines, the situation is much worse. Fortunately I had aisle seats both flights and was able to obtain partial relief by putting one leg out into the aisle - only to be told not to by the crew. Yesterdays flight was only 2-1/2 hours and I was having numbness and significant pain on exiting the plane. In January we going to Maui on Rouge - I am almost not looking forward to the trip knowing the result of previous trips. Why are the seats so close together?

### "friendly flight crew"
Los Angeles to Vancouver. First time flyer on Air Canada Rouge and not sure what to expect, but it was much more pleasant than recent United and Alaska flights we had encountered. Flight was on time but boarding took a bit long as flight was full. Very pleasantly surprised by the friendly flight crew - from the flight attendants to the pilots. It took a while to receive our beverage service as we were near the back, but acceptable. Did not try any food nor the entertainment app. Plane was clean and we liked the 767 layout (2-3-2) so as a couple, we had direct aisle access. Seats were adequate and not as narrow as expected but padding was thin. Copies of Enroute magazine were tattered and should have been replaced. Overall good flight. As a special touch, all crew including the pilot warmly wished us well when we arrived at YVR.

### "cabin crew were courteous and professional"
I must admit I did not know what to expect having read all the awful reviews about Air Canada Rouge and I am a terrible flier at the best of times so this only added to my feelings of dread, but, I was more than pleasantly surprised to find that the plane and seats were very comfortable and the cabin crew were excellent and very attentive. The food was hot and we were constantly supplied with fresh water and soda throughout the flight. I even managed to sleep for some of the flight, something I never do. Having stopped in Toronto to get a connecting flight to Edmonton I then started to get nervous again about the internal flight as again I had heard and read bad things about these but I need not have worried. The cabin crew were courteous and professional and we were once again supplied with water free of charge throughout the flight. I even managed to get some sleep on this flight too despite it only being 4 hours long. I have read in other reviews where people have said there is nowhere to plug in your charger for laptop or phone, there was charging slots for both of these on both flights, they're under the seat in front. I normally never leave reviews for anything like this but having seen all the negative ones I felt I had to talk about my positive experience. Maybe the old reviews are from old flights and experiences but I genuinely found the whole experience a pleasant one. Will definitely fly with them again.

### "some improvements noted"
Some improvements noted. We flew Air Canada rouge about two years ago on a similar route (AC regular YVR to Toronto then on Rouge to Cuba). That trip was really awful because of the cramped and thin seats. This trip was somewhat better. First we were given a surprise upgrade to the "business" section up front. I often fly AC regular and get upgrades to business class. I think Air Canada rouge business on this flight was pretty close on comfort of seats (4 abreast) with good leg room (close to AC Business). The lunch served was satisfactory and hot. This review focusses on our economy return flight. On the way back to Toronto we were in the back of the plane and the seats were exactly as we experienced on our first trip. Very, very tight for leg room and with a seat that was too short, too thin and had insufficient padding for the lower back (read no padding at all so any movement behind gets to you). But having suffered back pain on our earlier flight for days afterward, I planned things better and brought a coccyx cushion and it made a world of difference! Legs still too tight but back in better shape at the end. I noted that the crew both ways appeared to have learned over time - they put those silly hats away and were efficient and friendly (but not as silly friendly as previously). After our first trip I vowed never to fly Air Canada rouge again but our two week vacation in Cuba would not work with WestJet so we grudgingly tried Rouge again. Still not comfortable but better for service (and bring your own cushion it really made a difference to me).

### "I'm very disappointed"
I recently booked an all inclusive trip through Air Canada vacations and travelled on Air Canada rouge from Toronto to Montego Bay return. I was very disappointed with the flight being delayed both ways, lack of food, and entertainment app that did not work. I was hoping travelling in November would decrease the likelihood of a delayed or cancelled flight. We were delayed almost 1 hour leaving, and 2 hours returning with no explanation or estimated time. Our travel agent advised me that a 4 hour flight would mean we would be served a meal, but not only was a meal not included, of their menu options the only things left to purchase were nuts and chips. I thought maybe it was because we were at the back of an overbooked flight when we were leaving, but the same thing happened on our return flight that was half empty. The only entertainment is through an app you download on your phone or tablet or to rent one of their iPads. Not knowing this until boarding the plane I used my data to download this app before we took off. This app did not work at all the entire flight there! It did however on the way home. I'm very disappointed and won't be booking another trip through Air Canada vacations.

### "express my appreciation"
I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude for the excellent service provided on Air Canada rouge flight 1836 from Phoenix to Toronto on November 10th. Even though the seat I was assigned was the worst you can get on a plane (last aisle seat facing the washroom), the flight attendant kept checking on me making sure that my flight was as comfortable as can be. It is this kind of caring and professional service that builds the trust of customers to come back for more.

### "food ran out before my seat"
Montreal to Punta Cana and coming back 1 week later from Punta Cana to Montreal. A 4.5 hour flight, the wifi entertainment system (bring you own I pad) and I pre installed the software. The system malfunctioned and the flight attendants were not able to make it work. If the seat in front of you is reclined no room for your legs. Food catering always start front to back for purchase. My seat number going was 29E and coming back 30D. No more food, it ran out before my seat. The young flight attendants finished the catering and sat in the back. What about customer service. Next time I would rather pay more money to get a better service.

### "content with what is offered "
I was on an Air Canada rouge flight, Toronto to Edinburgh booked in Premium rouge,  having connected from an AC express flight from ORD at T1 YYZ. Boarding appeared efficient as AC passengers are ‘grouped’ depending on the type of ticket and frequent flyer status (if any) with AC and its Star Alliance partners. On boarding a bottle of water and a very small amenity kit was on each Premium rouge seat. FAs offered water or orange juice along with newspapers prior to departure. A menu was distributed. On offer, a chicken dish or vegetarian pasta; these orders were also taken prior to departure. Orders were also taken for devices to use the rouge IFE system. I declined as I wanted to rest. After departure, drinks were served, then hot towels, followed by the main meal service. The meal was satisfactory, the portion very acceptable. That said, extra drinks were more of an ‘on request’ service than actually being offered. The meal was cleared away about 1hr 45mins after departure. Due to the relatively quick Atlantic crossing there was not too much time available to rest, let alone sleep, as about an hour out from EDI a very light breakfast of banana cake with tea, coffee or juice was offered. The aircraft arrived at EDI about 45 mins early; however due to aircraft stand availability at EDI or the lack of it, the flight only terminated at the gate a minute or so before the scheduled ETA. This was my 8th flight in Premium rouge on the EDI / YYZ route with AC rouge and the 4th flight for this year. In my opinion the FAs are now much more mature and confident when this is compared to the early days of summer 2013. I have generally been content with what is offered in Premium rouge and will certainly use again. My only issue is, this being a seasonal route, it is not an option for trans Atlantic travel between late October and early June each year, such a pity!

### "I enjoyed my experience"
Vancouver to San Francisco, and this was my first time traveling with Air Canada rouge. The kiosk check-in was easy and smooth as well as the boarding process. I was surprised that you could connect to the wifi for free so I could use their media player on my tablet. I have to admit, they need to update their movie selection. Service was freindly. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and hope to fly with them again!

### "choose another airline"
Air Canada Rouge is the new low cost airline of Air Canada, and it is really a low cost. The flight was on time and OK. The service was very good. Comfort was average, but the food was bad and they did not offer wine or a beer for dinner. Next time on our return trip we will buy food at the airport. The entertainment system (bring your own device) offers a very limited choice of films and the films offered were sometimes old films. They don't offer any information on your flight. I often fly with low-cost airlines and Air Canada Rouge is the worst. I own a recent Window 8 laptop/tablet and I was unable to connect to the entertainement system.

### "truly enjoyed my flight"
Air Canada rouge from Rome to Montreal, and the service was fantastic. The flight attendants worked so hard it seemed they were always serving something on the 8 hour flight (AC 1921). Very friendly, professional young women. I truly enjoyed my flight. Thank you!

### "seems like a cash grab"
Great idea to inform customers that they can bring their own devices to watch the in-flight entertainment. What Air Canada rouge fail to inform about is that access to the current movies is only available if you rent the Air Canada device. With your own device the earliest movie you get access to is 5 years old. Paid the $10 on the return and watched recent releases. Give travelers access to the same options if they are downloading the in-flight app. Brutal. Seems like a cash grab.

### "disappointed by food service"
I was disappointed by the Air Canada rouge food service and options. I pre-ordered (and prepaid) for a meal. By the time they asked me what I wanted, the pickings were slim. My colleague (who did not pre-order) was only able to get cashews by the time they got to him. The stewardess apologized and said that they have such limited food on these flights that there is not enough to meet the demand. I feel that the airline should ensure that every customer is able to order a meal on flights over 3 hours. Travellers like me (from out of town) have a hard enough time getting to Toronto for early flights, clearing US Customs etc. Is it too hard to ask for a proper pre-ordered/prepaid meal? I am a very loyal Air Canada customer but experiences like this truly test my loyalty.

### "avoid if you can"
Air Canada Rouge, flight 1855 delayed presumably because we must wait for aircraft parts for a plane in Vegas. Additional 45 minutes for 250 passengers. Crew refused to serve even a coffee while waiting. This is not my first such experience with "Rouge". Avoid if you can.

### "found the seats very uncomfortable"
First time I flew on Air Canada Rouge. I found the seats very uncomfortable, very little padding. There was insufficient legroom and I am only 5' 10 " tall. The plane on the return trip was approximately 2/3 full and the flight attendant ran out of sandwiches by the time she reached my seat which was 3/4 of the way to the back of the plane. The cabin was very warm and I felt claustrophobic on the flight down but the temperature was fine on the return flight. The flight attendants did an excellent job considering what they had to work with. I will not fly Rouge in the future.

### "budget it certainly is"
Budget it certainly is. I was booked on this flight by my travel agent thinking I was was traveling with Air Canada. This really is budget. Makes Ryanair seen like delux travel. Very old plane. Even had slits in the toilets for used shaving blades. No TV screens for entertainment. Food comes in very small portions and is poor quality. Was given a can of Sprite to share when given our meals.

### "it does not get better"
I have flown Air Canada rouge four times and it does not get better. The aisle is very narrow and I am tired of getting hit by carts and people. I can't sit in the middle or window because its too tight. The cost of flying Air Canada rouge is not a deal and should nor be sold as one. It is expensive for the lack of space and service. Very few staff smile or care.

### "Nov 24 flights cancelled"
I had two flights from YYC to Honolulu booked for Nov 24 to Dec 1 and Air Canada called in mid October telling me all Nov 24 flights have been cancelled. The representative actually forgot to mention that all Dec 1 flights were also cancelled as well. Essentially with about a month to go, they changed everything about our flight dates. This means in order to accommodate their flights, we would have to re-book everything from excursions, hotels, and car rental. We ended up having to cancel with Air Canada Rouge and go with WestJet. I chose Air Canada over WestJet despite my girlfriends protests. On the plus side, both of the customer service representatives I spoke with were very nice and understanding.

### "wedged into the seat in front"
I've flown enough on Air Canada to make Elite status many times, and have gone to great lengths to use them whenever possible. This last flight on Rouge has turned that loyalty upside down. It was booked by a travel agent, and I did not fully appreciate the significance of Air Canada Rouge on my itinerary - one of the worst flights of my life. No  It started well. I like window seats, and I had one. I like to board early and get my carry-on bag into the overhead bin, and I did. When I sat down, I discovered the seat pitch - I'm 6"4" tall, and even with my back pressed into my seat, my knees were firmly wedged into the seat in front. The fellow sitting next to me was polite and respected the limited space available, but even that courtesy didn't help. I started to cramp a bit, and had a mild panic attack (also a first for me) because there was nothing I could do about it. Under such circumstances, what does it matter if the flight crew is good or bad? I couldn't lower the seat tray. I've avoided flying Spirit and discount airlines because I suspected I would be uncomfortable. Now Rouge has shown me just how severe that discomfort can be.

### "can't say I am impressed"
This was my 2nd time flying Air Canada rouge and I can't say I am impressed. Cabins are cramped for space, even for average 5ft 6in / 150lb women. No leg room, narrow aisle, way too many carry-ons for the overhead compartment space, poor entertainment system (i-pad for rent).

### "seats were uncomfortable"
We selected Air Canada rouge beacuse it was a direct flight and we did not have to travel via Heathrow - a bad mistake. The seats were uncomfortable and cramped, quality of meals was very poor, not sure what we ate on the outbound leg but the return meal was worse. The booking stated that our meals would be non specific and a continental beakfast, we agree with the non specific, it really was as we had no idea what the content was.The so called coninental breakfast was a tasteless cake with a lukewarm cup of coffee. The inflight entertainment on the outbound flight did not work. The cabin staff were disinterested.

### "seats are terrible"
Staff were friendly-ish. Not particularly smiley on the flight there and back. I asked for something and it was lost in the wind. Inflight entertainment is okay if you have your own Tablet or Phone. Movies and TV options were so-so. They rent iPads, but they don't carry a ton of them, so it's first come first served. They ran out when my wife tried to rent one. We shared my smartphone to watch a movie. Comfort, the seats are terrible. I think I'm fairly average 5'10" male, but my knee was firmly pressed against the back for the seat in front of me for the 4 hour flight. The guy behind me had his knee in my back as well. I had to have me leg in the aisle, in fact, I looked down the aisle, and all taller people had their legs hanging out. I also noted that more people were standing and walking around on this flight more that I've ever seen. I don't know if it's in my head but they also don't recline as far. No food served but juice, coffee, tea and water. You have the option to purchases things on the flight. I love Air Canada, but Rouge is terrible!

### "seats not very comfortable"
Air Canada rouge from San Francisco to Vancouver. Friendly servie but the economy seats are inadequate for an average size person. Basically no leg room. Your knees are always up against the seat in front of you. The seats are not very comfortable for sititng either. If it was a true budget airline maybe I would put up with the lack of any leg room but the prices are comparable to other airlines on that route.

### "experience extremely positive"
We were a bit apprehensive about flying Air Canada Rouge because we had never heard anything about it and the reviews were not great. But our experience turned out to be extremely positive. The wonderful young people who worked that flight helped to make the nine hour trip so very positive. Cabin staff were so hardworking and went out of the way to assure the comfort of the passengers- it was a very crowded plane. The food was good for airplane food and we were served two meals. We would definitely choose to fly Air Canada Rouge again!

### "impressed by some of the changes"
What a difference a year makes. I wrote a review last year scolding Air Canada rouge over my bad experience. This past trip I was so impressed by some of the changes. Staff were warm and welcoming, new business class seats comfortable, movies current and great selection. Food, keep trying but not bad.

### "impressed with the staff"
Rome to Toronto and even though there was no entertainment (unless you rented an airline iPad) I found it easy to amuse myself with the music on my iPhone and a good book. I have never flown on a plane without TVs but the lack of entertainment gave me an opportunity to observe my surroundings. I was extremely impressed with the staff on this flight. I noticed that a passenger was quite rude to one of the attendants no matter how hard the attendant tried to please her. It was impressive to see how the attendant remained calm and polite and did everything she could to make the passenger happy. I wasn't feeling well when the flight began, but attentive staff did everything to offer me assistance and continued to check on me throughout the 9 hour flight. I was flying with a group tour and one of the ladies in my group was ill with a sore throat and staff made sure that she had ginger ale and/or tea at all times. In between the meal and snack times the staff offered water, tea, coffee, etc. If I ever have to fly economy again I truly hope that I am lucky enough to fly with a staff who cares about their passengers as much as this team has.

### "very happy with Air Canada rouge"
Not sure I have flown with the same airline as most reviewers, but I have to say my wife and I were very happy with Air Canada rouge and will use again. After booking via my bank and reading the feedback on this site we were a bit apprehensive as to what to expect. Need not have worried. Staff whilst less in numbers on board were a great team and did all that I would required on a flight for service and standards. Food was fine and no worse than virtually any other airline we have used. I enjoyed mine and it hit the mark. Entertainment onboard worked fine as long as you are aware you need to download the App in advance or rent an Ipad on board. At $10 (£5.04 billed) its fine. Films a bit limited but enough to find something to keep you entertained. Seat size fine and having flown back Lufthansa can honestly say no real difference noted so again do not see peoples issues. Leg room also more than enough. Only real quibble I have is on the lack of duty free and fact website makes no statement to advise if available or not. Will happily use again and for the price paid very happy with what we got. Just a shame they only operate in the summer season but that may change in the future.

### "didn't think it could get worse"
I didn't think it could get worse than US Airways but Air Canada was up for the task. First of all you have to realize that the Rouge is code for their discount airline. So it you are traveling to Europe on Rouge you are in for a very long and uncomfortable flight. First we noticed that the plane did not have its own air vents over the seats. So you were at the mercy of what ever temperature the captain set up. Our section didn't have functioning reading lights. This was obviously a known issue as the flight attendant brought me an Air Canada clip on light. The leg room is as bad as any discount airlines I've ever been on. The food was at best terrible and if you didn't like what they had to serve you they didn't even have any food for sale. It was a flight from Toronto to Athens. They served us no protein as we requested a gluten free meal. It was rice and chick peas. For breakfast we got a disgusting gluten free muffin with margarine. They wouldn't even serve us coffee because the fasten seat belt sign was on. Oh and don't forget your money because drinks, not even wine with your dinner is included in the price. They don't have entertainment on board. You have to bring your own to log on to their outdated movies section. This makes it very hard to eat or drink when you have a laptop on your tray table. Oh and the flight attendants are very young with a horrible attitude.

### "I was disappointed"
Barcelona to Montreal, and I was disappointed with the Air Canada rouge experience! I would have thought with an international flight you would not have to pay for entertainment or beverages. The service was the worst I have encountered, food was terrible and washrooms were dirty.

### "very impressed with the care"
After a glorious vacation ending in Rome, my family consisting of brother-in-law, 2 sister-in-laws and myself, boarded our flight at the Rome Airport. We were very impressed with the care and attention we received. One male attendant in particular was excellent. He was what I can only guess is what Air Canada Rouge must be looking for in all their attendants, friendly, attentive, positive and professional. We can not thank him enough for such a wonderful flight. The food and wine were delicious and we all enjoyed it. I cannot think of very many flights where the service was excellent. All the attendants were wonderful. We all agreed that Air Canada rouge is the way to fly from now on.

### "the service was great"
My wife and I flew Air Canada and Air Canada rouge to and from Dublin to Toronto and Calgary this last month. The service was great on Air Canada rouge, and not bad on the plain Air Canada. We sat in premium economy on the flights to and from Calgary / Toronto. And we sat in Premium rouge to and from Dublin / Toronto. The people were great and other than some not nice turbulence they were great flights.

### "no on-board entertainment"
The air vents didn't work (or was disabled) through the flight, the crew was not pleasant. There is no on-board entertainment unless you download their Rouge app and use your own device. I had to rent an ipad for 10.00. The products they advertise in their brochure (tucked into the seat in front of you) was not what they actually sold on the plane. The films they advertised in the flyer was not the films you were given on the ipad. In fact, there were mostly older films and very few new releases to chose from. The captain had the fasten seatbelt light on so much that people couldn't get to the bathroom most of the time, you couldn't get up to move around, and it was 2.5 hours before we even got a hot drink! Would never fly Air Canada rouge again.

### "don't have entertainment onboard"
The plane did not have air vents over the seats, so you are at the mercy of whatever temperature the captain set up. Our section didn't have functioning reading lights. The leg room is as bad as any discount airline I've been on. The food was terrible and they don't have any food for sale. It was a flight from Toronto to Athens. They served us no protein as we requested a gluten free meal - it was rice and chick peas. For breakfast we got a gluten free muffin with margarine. They wouldn't serve coffee because the fasten seat belt sign was on. Drinks, not even wine with your dinner, are not included in the price. They don't have entertainment onboard, you have to bring your own to log on to their movies section. This makes it very hard to eat or drink when you have a laptop on your tray table. The flight attendants were very young with a poor attitude.

### "one of the nicest flights"
From the moment of boarding, the Air Canada rouge crew was upbeat, positive and made you feel valued as a customer. A special mention for the purser, who handled all the responsibilities of her job with panache and lots of personality, and another staff who was a delight to deal with, and went out of her way to make people feel comfortable. I must say, because of the crew that day, it was one of the nicest flights I have been on.

### "lack of leg room"
My sisters and I travelled Toronto to Dublin with Air Canada rouge for a 2 week vacation. We were disappointed in the 'leisure' airline, and the lack of leg room made it a very uncomfortable six hour flight. The supper served was acceptable, but the breakfast was a cold slice of banana bread. We felt cramped, the app for accessing movies etc was not up to much and we were generally feeling unhappy with this leisure airline. I would not book with Air Canada rouge  again.

### "great happy flight crew"
We had never flown on Air Canada rouge before and did not know what to expect on our flight from Toronto to Athens. We had heard that the crews were relatively new and young and the service was so-so. The flight was about 9.5 hours and it went by quickly, thanks in part to a great happy flight crew. Staff were courteous and very attentive.

### "seat comfort was terrible"
My wife and I flew to Las Vegas on Air Canada rouge. It was the most uncomfortable flight I've taken. The seat comfort was terrible (no leg room and very cramped). I had to sit straight up in my seat for the entire flight and could barely move. Flight attendants were okay.

### "fly Air Canada rouge again without any worry"
Having booked Premium economy through lastminute.com it showed us in premier from Dublin to Toronto and then business from Toronto to Las Vegas. Very happy with this, I then reviewed Air Canada and found out about the new Air Canada rouge and then worried and having read all the reviews, worried even more. Having just arrived home I can tell anyone flying Air Canada rouge in "Premier Rouge" not to worry at all. It is a mix of business and premium economy. We had two bags checked to 32kg each, express check in and express security alongside priority boarding made the whole airport experience totally stress free. Having boarded we were greeted onboard the Dublin to Toronto flight with a glass of complimentary water/OJ and also had two bottles of water waiting for us at our seats with a complimentary "pack" containing flight socks, ear plugs, face mask, headphones & toothbrush and toothpaste. This was in addition to the pillow and blanket. As people were boarding we were given our meal menu and complimentary iPads which we were able to hang from the seat in front. It was no different to any other airlines inflight entertainment system. As it was their ipad they had additional up to date movies to also watch. A nice large armrest between us with a built in tray for holding drinks was very convenient. Our order was taken and after take off, our table was set for us with linen cloths and selection of proper cutlery with wine glass for our meal which was lovely. Complimentary drinks "wine, spirits etc" the whole way also made our first flight a very pleasant and comfortable experience. People also complained about the trays which you retrieved from your armrest. There was no issue with these at all and a child could take them out. They also "slid" forward and back making it very convenient if you were working on a laptop or viewing your ipad from your table instead of hanging it from the headrest. Each flight was similar in standard except the seats were larger and more "business" from Toronto to Las Vegas. I liked these seats and whilst they were bigger in size they did not recline as much as the Dublin to Toronto flight which was surprising. My wife was also given a complimentary inflatable neck pillow on the Toronto to Las Vegas flight. Overall the only complaint I would have would be the recline of the seats which at 7 inches was not ideal for sleeping on the homeward night flight. (We flew Delta and the recline in premium economy was much greater). We were seated in the bulkhead seats on the homeward flight and at 5ft 11, I found the legroom just slightly tight, we had more legroom in the bulkhead middle aisle than those at the bulkhead on the side aisles. If not in the bulk head you have no worries at all. If it wasn't a night flight I would have had no issue with the leg room as you could still "stretch out" slightly. We were seated in rows 3 for Dublin to Toronto, rows 2 for the Toronto to Las Vegas and Las Vegas to Toronto with row 1 for Toronto to Dublin. So If you are flying premier rouge do not worry, you have plenty of leg room, good attentive service, complimentary drinks and a much better meal and the additional perks at the airport with extra luggage allowance and "priority luggage" also means your bags arrive first. Comparing them to Delta, who we previously flew premium economy with, I would fly Air Canada rouge again without any worry as they have a much better overall package.

### "the bargain basement arm of Air Canada"
For our visit to Canada we had flown from Heathrow to Ottawa with Air Canada - this was absolutely fine and we had booked extra legroom seats next to an exit door. We also flew Air Canada from Ottawa to Quebec City, again absolutely fine. To return to the UK, we had booked to fly from Toronto to Manchester and again booked extra leg room seats next to the exit. That was the only good thing about the flight, as this was an Air Canada Rouge flight. When we were boarding, I thought that the stewards were in fancy dress. They were casually dressed, as was their manner. As our flight was due to leave and did at 10.30 p.m., I did not expect food, but at 11.45 p.m. we were presented with the most awful slop. I was woken up, leave me alone. This was the start of a little girl screaming for hour after hour. I expected that we would get a light breakfast, but we got a slice of cake and a drink and this was for a flight that landed at 10.45 am. There was no entertainment, but they were hiring out ipads at 10$ a time. Obviously this is the bargain basement arm of Air Canada, even if it is not reflected in the price.

### "I will not fly them again"
I have flown with Air Canada for over 15 years, but after this experience I will not fly them again. After booking, I was never told that it was an Air Canada rouge plane, the worst plane I have been on. Customer service was terrible and on trying to get an explanation from Air Canada I was just brushed aside. It was tight, cramped, no tv's, bad food,  and a very uncomfortable. I warn anyone to be very careful when booking with Air Canada rouge because it was a horrible experience.

### "making a long flight enjoyable"
I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the inflight staff of Air Canada rouge flight AC1934 on August 31st, from Montreal to Athens. In particular, we were impressed by the professional yet friendly service we received from two cabin staff members. A big "shout out" to them both, and thanks for making a long overseas flight enjoyable!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Edinburgh to Toronto with Air Canada rouge. Staff, service and meals were great. Some points for improvement: I was not informed that my flight was with Air Canada rouge so was surprised when the flight started boarding (originally booked under Lufthansa, which ended up giving an Air Canada flight, with no indication of change to a rouge flight. An email would have been greatly appreciated. I only received an email with Air Canada flight number. I was surprised at the fact that there had been no indication of a lack of inflight entertainment (in the form of TVs, as the flight was 7 hrs long, and the previous 2 hr flight with Air Canada had TV's) prior to boarding the plane. After boarding the plane, there was an announcement that passengers should download the Air Canada app and use that to access the entertainment. By that time, I was no longer able to access the airport wifi (nor had data) to download the app. There was no indication that it was possible to to connect to Air Canada rouge wifi and download it on the plane. It would have been helpful for that announcement to have been made while I was waiting for the plane at the gate as well as an announcement that the app could be downloaded from on-board wifi.

### "Staff great, flight was problem free"
We flew Air Canada rouge from Manchester to Orlando via Toronto in August. The first plane to Toronto was the Boeing 767 which was roomy enough in economy for us, I'm 6ft tall and the seat pitch was fine. The food was not the best, but certainly not the worst we've ever had. Staff were great, flight was problem free. As long as you go onboard knowing there is no in flight entertainment then you won't be disappointed. We took our own ipads etc and was fine. The route from Toronto to Orlando was a bit more cramped as we were on an A319 but it was only a 2hr 50 flight so for the price we paid was overall very happy with Air Canada rouge. We saved roughly £2500 by using Air Canada rouge indirect to Orlando over the bigger airlines like British Airways, Virgin etc so don't be put off by the bad reviews folks.

### "So many rows crammed on the plane"
The seats on Air Canada rouge are crammed so close together that many passengers - me included - couldn't even fit. So many rows crammed on the plane means too many people trying to use too little overhead bin space. While the plane screamed discount carrier, Air Canada was charging about the same as other airlines on this same route.

### "a vast improvement over my previous flight"
As a very frequent traveller on Air Canada I had flown Rouge once previously and was very disappointed. While it is dubbed a leisure airline, the fares are not much different from the mainline carrier. My previous experience was with the Erou seating in business. The new configuration in Rouge is now 2x2' with power at the seats. The meal and beverage service from Toronto to Kelowna was comparable to a domestic Air Canada flight. The cabin attendant was pleasant and served the cabin well. A vast improvement over my previous flight. This review is for Premium rouge. I still would not fly in the economy section as the seating is extremely tight-29" pitch. So chose this airline carefully.

### "for price paid, we certainly got value for money"
Dublin to Montreal via Toronto with Air Canada rouge. Having read the many negative reviews of Air Canada rouge, we were not looking forward to the experience. Had checked in online, but on arrival at the bag drop, a combination of a systems glitch and an inexperienced check in girl, insisted that we had checked in a bicycle - we stood at the head of an restless crowd for at least 20 minutes, until the mythical bike was dispatched to cyber space and our boarding cards were handed over. It was onwards and upwards from there. Our full flight with a high baby count left on time and was reasonably peaceful. We enjoyed the hot breakfast. Our seats in front of (and seemed attached to) the toilets meant we heard and felt every flush but mercifully nothing more. While we found the young Air Canada rouge staff to be professional, they lacked charm and seemed incapable of smiling. Fastest deplaning ever in Toronto, as connecting passengers we were fast tracked through immigration and customs and so had time for a nice lunch prior to our on time departure to Montreal. This short flight was operated by Air Canada, and what a difference - charm, courtesy and even a drink and snack. Our trip home was a doddle, effortless check in at Montreal, very pleasant flight with Air Canada, easy on time connection to Air Canada rouge in Toronto. A full but quiet flight home to Dublin marred only by a truly vile diner (and a charge of 6 dollars for a small bottle of wine). Air Canada rouge personnel glum and would certainly benefit from instruction from Air Canada personnel. Overall and for the price paid, we certainly got value for money. Would probably prefer to travel with the full fare Air Canada in future. ***NO NAME

### "you won't get a bargain with Air Canada Rouge"
The return flights to Toronto from Manchester were with Air Canada Rouge. On-time departures, friendly crew and fairly comfortable seat but food was awful (vegetable curry with rice for dinner was inedible and only got a small muffin for breakfast) and the entertainment (downloadable to an I-Pad) was poor. Think of a flight with Ryanair to Tenerife and you should have a good idea of what to expect. Except the price. You won't get a bargain with Air Canada Rouge. Strange that, if you fly from London Heathrow, you'll fly Air Canada with (presumably) decent food and entertainment. But then this route is also served by British Airways. Manchester isn't, that's why they only offer Air Canada Rouge flights. Toronto used to be a good airport but is now chaotic and not a good airport to change planes. Return flight to Pittsburgh was on a tired-looking turboprop. Delayed going out; on-time back. Friendly service. Free drinks.

### "app to be installed prior to boarding"
My experience from Barcelona to Toronto on Air Canada Rouge was different than when I flew from Toronto to Istanbul on Air Canada. The boarding process in Barcelona was chaos - it was slow and people didn't know where they were to stand or when they were to board. We ended up leaving almost 30 minutes late which compromised the time to clear security/customs in Toronto for the connecting flights. Onboard one attendant was terse and unforgiving when a passenger successfully stowed a bag in the upper bin, only to have another passenger open the bin and that's when the attendant wrestled out the bag and told the passenger it was too big for the bin and had to be checked - it was already stowed away! Also, we didn't know until we boarded the plane that in-flight entertainment only worked on our personal devices and your app had to be installed prior to boarding - that's too late to let us know. The trip from Toronto to Istanbul was the opposite - very quick boarding and extremely friendly and accommodating crew.

### "I am beyond disappointed"
We were =supposed to travel from Dublin to Toronto then Toronto to Denver, but it didn't end up happening that way. It took us nearly 2 hours just to board our plane in Dublin. Then, once we were finally on, it took another 20 minutes for them to even turn the plane on. They wouldn't even turn air on for us so it was somewhere around 85 degrees Fahrenheit in the cabin. Then, after the delay, I soon discovered that Air Canada has faux wifi, as in your device will say you're connected to wifi, but in reality, you can only go to Air Canada's "entertainment" site. Not a good airline if you want to arrive on time to your destination. Once we landed in Toronto, we sat at the gate for over half an hour because of an accounting error that didn't even happen on the plane. They couldn't open the door, because of a mistake that didn't even directly affect us. I would like to add that there was no air again so it was even hotter than when we were boarding. We ended up getting so delayed that we missed our connecting flight in Toronto by over an hour and so did a good portion of the other passengers on the plane. They re-routed us to Chicago, then to Denver. In that time, we never saw our bags once, and both flights were delayed. Again. When we arrived in Denver this evening, we learned that none of the four suitcases in our party were on the plane that we flew in on. Told that our bags would be delivered to our personal address tomorrow, but I have my doubts considering they don't know where they are. I am beyond disappointed.

### "why they are so rude"
We flew from Dublin to Calgary with a stop over in Toronto with Air Canada Rouge. I was ready for the bad seating, bad food and flight delays, what I was not ready for was the rudeness the cabin crew - for such a young crew its beyond me as to why they are so rude. I thought I heard the seat belt light go off and stood up to get my headphones from the ove head compartment when I heard the attendant screaming at me , not only did she scare me but also half the plane, (yes it was a mistake on my part). I sat down so quick I forgot to close the overhead she then got from her seat and closed it with such unnecessary force. Not once did I see them smile at passengers. Food, not sure you can call it. We then flew Air Canada onto Calgary, I understand Rouge is a budget airline but it brings the Air Canada name down. Cabin crew are a little older on Air Canada but seem to have come with manners not like Rouge crew. On flying home from Calgary my flight was delayed a few hours, I can cope with that, but it was hard to keep up with the changing gates as no updates were posted. While waiting for the Toronto flight to Dublin all the crew were sitting on the windows or floors in the Departure lounge playing with mobile phones or staring out the window. My friend who I traveled with came back at a later date, her flight was delayed leaving Calgary so she missed her connecting flight and was put up in a hotel. It was only after arriving at the hotel did she see that the flight she was on was to Zurich and then on to Dublin, she went back to the airport and was told that there was no budget seats on the next flight, only premier seats and she would have to pay. After arguing for over 4 hours she then discovered that they were assigning seats on an Aer Lingus flight to passengers after another 2 hours they assigned her a seat on Aer Lingus.

### "service was pleasant and efficient"
Think of Air Canada Rouge as Ryanair for the Atlantic and you'll know what to expect. Flew Dublin to Toronto. Most of the complaints are fair, but you get what you pay for. We knew in advance what to expect and had taken a few precautions: The ipads you can rent on board have a poor selection of films. If you have a portable device, pre-load it with some entertainment/films of your own. There were power sockets at each pair of seats on our flight, so bring an american socket adaptor to keep device topped-up. They supply a small pillow and blanket, the pillow can help make up for poor seating - especially at the bass of the spine. Yes legroom is tight. The food is the bare minimum but service was pleasant and efficient. Overall quality of flight and timekeeping were quite good. We were trying to keep within a budget and safe money for decent hotel etc. Business travellers used to more comfort will find plenty to complain about. Obviously the wi-fi is not wi-fi (as we know it Jim), just a local streaming system using the device's wifi operability. We just tried it out of curiosity but the selection was poor. Remember to pre-load their entertainment app which becomes usable once you're in the air. Squeeze up there now and make the best of it.

### "cramped seating, young flight attendants"
First and last time on Air Canada Rouge from Montreal to Las Vegas. Cramped seating, young flight attendants with very little experience who allows people to come on the plane with half their apartment cramped in luggage. Why is AC allowing folks to fill up their overhead bin with oversized multiple luggage and have the rudeness to ask you (who diligently check your bags specifically to avoid crowding the bins), if you could put you only backpacks under your own seat when there's literally no where to put you legs in to begin with. It would be nice if airlines would begin applying the one luggage onboard policy. To make things worse, Flight AC 1857 to Las Vegas on August 27th, was diverted to Chicago because of an unruly passenger. The situation could not have been handled any worse, hence my comment on the stewards experience. Will never ever fly on Rouge again.

### "some cabin crew lacked professionalism"
I recently travelled to Athens by Air Canada Rouge. We left 1.5 hours late due to equipment problem. I found some cabin crew lacked professionalism. The person reading most of the instructions was not clear. The meal was okay. My impression lately is that Air Canada rouge is providing the bare minimum customer service.

### "can't think of anything nice to say"
Air Canada Rouge, Lax to Manchester via Toronto. What a disgrace they are to the Air Canada family. The only nice thing I have to say was that we landed safely back in Manchester. Other than that I can't think of anything nice to say.

### "most uncomfortable"
This was my first and it will be my last flight with Air Canada Rouge from Vancouver to Halifax via Calgary. This was the ""cabin I have flown in. If you are over 5'8" in height, don't even think about flying with rouge. I am 6'2" and my knees were pressed against the seat ahead of me. Flight Service was mediocre as was the food.

### "we were squashed in seats"
Had a wonderful trip to Prince Edward Island in August 2015, with one exception. We had Air Canada all the way there and back. On the way there our first leg, Vancouver to Calgary, second leg, Calgary to Halifax, Air Canada Rouge. Air Canada Rouge was awful. We flew out of Calgary at 1130 at night and were met by stewardesses with top hats and fancy slack outfits. Once on the plane we were squashed in seats with no TVs and offered to rent Ipads for $10 to watch TV. The other thing was someone had their cat on the plane in a crate and got moved to first class because the cat was upset. I'm sorry but what about the rest of us. Just a heads up to anyone travelling in the near future. Would not travel Air Canada Rouge again.

### "not worth the hassle"
Flew Air Canada Rouge thinking that is was an Air Canada flight (booked from Air Canada Vacations site). I am 6'3" and found that there was no legroom. My knees were right against the seat in front of me. I have never experienced this before. As many users have mentioned the thin seats provide no support whatsoever. The staff were very good though I did not appreciate the fact I needed to purchase any food during the flight. Beware if you do not have an Apple device - you will need to rent an IPAD to view the terrible in-flight entertainment. Again as many other users have indicated, the cost savings from Rouge is non-existant and the cramped seating and lack of meals is just not worth the hassle. A previously loyal Air Canada customer will never be flying with Air Canada Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Without a doubt the worst long-haul flight I have taken. Not so low cost but low quality, lack of space for seating and luggage. Terrible inflight entertainment, use your own mobile/tablet to see old films series or rent their iPads to see the same with a few new releases accompanied by. Worse than normal food. First and last time.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada rouge is dull, grey and colorless, with a crew who appear to have their minds on everything but the passengers. Very uncomfortable for a long flight, food quality poor with limited choice, and they charge for everything. It is not a cheap or budget airline - prices are high! Sadly the quality of service does not match the costs and it is very poor value for money.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I was extremely disapointed when I was realised that my regular Air Canada experience was getting degraded to Rouge. They have no leg room, no entertainment, and are simply not the Air Canada I know and love.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Poor bargain basement airline. Would not fly again. The food was poor for such a long flight, some nice staff though. You can't buy duty free on board too, in fact they offer very little.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Sloppy flight attendants. These uniforms although meant to be casual, are being worn as just plain sloppy. Worst of all this translated into sloppy service. The food served was awful, the eggs in the morning were inedible. Instead of offering water through the night, the crew sat at the back chatting. Come on Air Canada, I was embarrassed to be a Canadian looking at this sorry bunch.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
If an effort to save money and increase revenue, Air Canada has replaced many of it's Air Canada routes with Rouge equipment. Maybe this would be OK if there were a significant cost saving, but for my flight there wasn't. I only flew Rouge because (surprise surprise) it was the only routing available using my Aeroplan points. Had I paid to fly it would have been the same cost as regular carriers or AC via Frankfurt. It would have actually be more expensive when you factor in the cost to upgrade to Rouge plus and to purchase a drink. On the flight over I upgraded to Rouge Plus seating (more legroom and recline) which basically brought me back to a regular Air Canada seat. The thin seat was not near as comfortable as regular seats on Air Canada (or other carriers). The lack of an entertainment system would have been acceptable if the streaming system had anything made in this decade. I can't imagine anyone finding anything to watch that wasn't 5-10 years old. On the return flight I opted to sit in regular economy seats in Rouge and thank goodness that the lady in front of me didn't recline her seat, my knees were already pressed into the back of her chair when upright. On the plus side the meals were OK (even if we did have to pay for alcohol) and the staff for the most part were OK. They were young and a bit more pleasant than some of the regular AC staff. Ultimately I will not fly Rouge again unless I have no other alternatives. It saddens me to see Air Canada replacing many of it's flights with Rouge (no flights to Florida this winter on anything other than Rouge). The cost saving offered by Rouge is non-existant and the cramped seating and lack of meals/drinks is just not worth the hassle.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
This was my first time flying Air Canada Rouge and it's nowhere near as comfortable as the regular Air Canada flights. It wasn't horrible for me because I knew a few people who had flown Rouge recently and had told me what to expect. However, no screens, no outlets, having to rent iPads, less comfortable seats, and broken armrests meant that a lot of people around me were surprised and very unhappy with the aircraft. I know they put the Rouge planes on the routes that aren't too busy, but it does surprise me that Rouge flights don't seem to be any cheaper than regular Air Canada flights because that would make it more worth it. When I booked my flight I didn't know that it would be a Rouge flight, otherwise I probably wouldn't have selected it because it wasn't any cheaper than other airlines with more to offer that would also get me to my destination. I will say that the crew was fantastic. They were very helpful because many of us had questions or concerns about making connecting flights at YYZ and the had all the answers. The flight was fine, the food was fine, the bathroom was fine, but the crew made me happy. Still, not the greatest flight because you pay regular fare, but pretty much feel like you're on a budget airline lacking all the regular amenities even if they give you a hot meal. They really underestimate how much people want their free movies for a long flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
First time on Rouge and will be the last. Asked for an upgrade to be told full. Yes it was full with 4 crew members sitting in those seats. It would have been nice to know that they took the entertainment systems out to save on weight, so have fun watching 15 year old movies on your phone. Seats had foam removed to save on weight as well. That was right from an Air Canada employee. Where did the nice Air Canada Planes with PODS go to Maui. A extinct animal that will be missed. Drop the Rouge Air Canada, be the classy airline you are and nto trying to save money with this knock off of a charter.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
No inflight entertainment unless you have previously downloaded their app. Attendants are all under 25 and it was a giggle fest. First leg of our return flight delayed over an hour (we were boarded) so we were bumped off our second leg. Rescheduled, then we find out our seats on our third leg were reassigned. Only by being very assertive did the ground personnel do something about it. Total misinformation regarding customs from the flight crew causing us an hour at customs that was not necessary. Never again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Never again. I will always ask when booking my flights from now on to see if it is a Rouge flight. They won't tell you. It is the worst airline I have been on and I am a frequent traveler. Seats are too tight, bad service, rude crew, delays for mechanical issues, terrible entertainment system and of course they are supported by the Air Canada baggage handlers, the worst in the industry. We had to wait for our checked bags for almost an hour and it was 12.30am.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
This was my return flight from Las Vegas to Toronto on August 10, 2015. Flight 1854. I have a severe anaphylactic peanut/nut allergy. Just over a week before I travelled, I contacted Air Canada to inform them. Upon baggage check-in and gate check-in I also informed the airline. As I entered the aircraft I informed one of the flight crew. The main question that was asked of me at each check-point was do I carry an epipen and if so how many. This crew, as well as the crew travelling to Las Vegas on Flight 1853 (Toronto to Las Vegas) on August 5, 2015, did an excellent job. The crew on the first flight did assure me that even though they usually provide peanuts to the first class/business class cabin, that they would not be serving those at all on this flight. A member of the flight crew on this first flight did approached me and the rows behind, next to and in front of me about a peanut-free zone. The crew on the second flight made a cabin announcement as part of their safety demonstration that they would not be serving peanuts/nuts on this flight and that one passenger has a severe allergy and that the passengers should refrain from consuming any such food. This was the first flights in a long time that my allergy was treated with respect and professionalism. I took the advantage of boarding the flights early to wipe down my seat and tray table and to set up my area with a blanket, but that is a great feature and something that I will request upon further travel.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
When I arrived in Vancouver from Toronto, I had 10 minutes to catch my connecting flight. I made it in time, and the plane waited another 10-15 minutes for other travellers to make it on board. Imagine my surprise and delight when my suitcase arrived at my destination. On the way back, I had messed up my connecting flight in Vancouver leaving myself a day between flights. Flights to Toronto were full. Rather than flying to Vancouver and waiting a day, the sales agent moved the first leg of the journey up by a day at no charge. I was also able to transfer my baggage charge. The staff were accommodating. The flights themselves were comfortable enough. I would fly Air Canada again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I realize that with a deal you have to compromise but Air Canada Rouge is the worst airline I have flown. There is no in flight entertainment unless you download their app and watch on your own device. Okay, not the end of the world. There is no food or snack provided unless you want to buy it. The seats are unbearably tight. The width is ok but my knees were basically in the seat in front of me. The flight attendants were subpar at best. My flight Toronto to Las Vegas had slightly better staff, but the way home was brutal. One woman in particular continued to hip check passengers as she passed up and down the aisles without apology. None of the attendants did anything to try to assist the screaming children on both legs of my trip. Dismissive and rude at best, one attendant actually said to another passenger "What do you expect? This is Air Canada Rouge? There are quite a few companies out there that allow you to save a few dollars and have an enjoyable flight. Rouge is definitely not one of them.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I am a Montreal resident and I have been hearing a lot of complaints about the airline on the internet but I found these issues to be isolated at best and should not reflect the overall service given. I flew premium economy and in terms of value vs experience it was a very enjoyable flight. Seat Pitch was comfortable at 37 inches and the recline was good. They gave me two choices on the menu for supper and it was very tasty considering it's airline food. Contrary to what I heard for the on board entertainment, some of the releases were fairly new. The service offered was professional and courteous. My needs as a customer were met. Priority boarding was a nice feature. I really like that part. The flights were on time and boarding was quick. For all those who are booking with this airline, I would suggest going Premium Rouge for long flights.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
After reading many poor reviews about AC Rouge I was pleasantly surprised by our trip to Barcelona. Seats were OK but do not recline more than a couple of inches so I found it impossible to sleep. I you're over 6 ft tall you may have a problem with the seat spacing in economy. Food was passable but not great. Crew were all very pleasant and helpful. No screens in the seat backs but if you take your ipad/tablet then you can watch the in-flight movies. The plane looked to be relatively new. Check in online before you go to the airport and then you can bypass the long queue. Price was very good which makes up for small inconveniences.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
On both flights there has been a 2 hour delay. The first delay in Dublin resulted in me missing my connecting flight, the staff on the flight assured us that connecting flights would be delayed slightly allowing passengers to reach the next flight. Currently waiting on the flight to Houston, staff yet to offer reason as to why it was delayed!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew to Lisbon from Toronto July 27 2015, plane was a older model, no entertainment system. We had to download an app on the iPad or if you don't have a iPad the airline rents them for $10. Movies are mostly older ones, which I was shocked to see, since I've flown overseas many times. The leg room seems tight compared to other overseas flights I've taken. Crew were very nice. I'm Canadian, and very disappointed in my countries main airliner. Long ways to go to be a premium airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We are a family of 5 who had booked a flight from Montreal to Athens with Aegean Airlines on July 26, 2015. It turned out it was Air Canada Rouge, flight AC 1902. The experience was mostly poor. The airplane was a 767-300 with tight legroom and no entertainment monitor displays. This was a big surprise for a transatlantic flight. When I did the web check-in on aircanada.com, it showed that the airplane had individual displays. The crew said you could download the application on an android or apple smartphone or rent an Ipad for $10. Of course we do not have such a device for each member of the family and paying for such a basic service item was out of the question. The Wifi was slow and the entertainment server would show busy many times when we tried to connect with the smartphone. The food was below average but the washrooms were kept in good condition during the flight. The only positive was the crew. They did all they could to help with questions and queries. I am not impressed with Air Canada Rouge. The quality of service is much lower than with Air Transat which we used to travel to Spain, Portugal, and France.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I was hesitant to book this airline going to Osaka due to the negative reviews here but it was the cheapest option. To my surprise, me and family did not have any negative experiences a lot of other commenters had. I'm 5'10 and found the seats to have average legroom just like any other airline I've flown. The crew were professional, helped out immediately when someone needed it, and served with a smile. The food to me was good, obviously not restaurant fancy, but good and filling. Drinks and bottled water, not tap, was offered every now and then. Although there is no screen in front of you to provide you with in-flight entertainment or location, they have an app that you can download on your Apple or Android where you can access some good movies from. I had no problem connecting to it and it kept me entertained for the long flight. Overall, I would fly with them again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I checked our family of 6 in online before we departed YVR. For some reason, I was not able to complete this for my sister. Once we arrived at YVR, the agent could not explain why there was a problem. Departure was on time. Leg room was non-existent, and I'm only 5'2" tall! Seats cushion reminded me of those foamies we used to sit on in 1978 for a football game. Seat only reclined 1.5" for an red-eye flight. Only purchased a chocolate bar for $3.50 so no idea of food quality. Only 2 drink services on a 6 hour flight seemed a little poor (and hot drinks were not available one way). IFE was non-accessible because we weren't told about the app until 3 minutes before we had to turn off our phones - no time to download. On the way home I has this handled only to discover the movies were tremendously old! Attendant who spoke in eng/fr over the PA system spoke so poorly, it reminded me of a Charlie Brown episode. I'm all for low-brow discount air travel, but I expected better of AC. I might as well have flown with Allegiant. In that case, I know what I'll find (and do to Vegas regularly). So poor value for $. For the same amount, I could fly with Hawaiian out of Seatac and receive full service and leg room.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada rouge was a disgrace at least on this flight. The aircraft interior was dirty, seats shabby and the state of the toilet was atrocious. The aircraft had been at the gate for long enough to be properly cleaned, so there was no excuse for the lack of cleanliness. Flight attendants completely indifferent throughout the flight. Clearly they were intent on doing the bare minimum. Surely and unsmiling. Very poor standard of grooming, some looked like they had slept in their uniforms. There is no in seat entertainment system. A long flight on Air Canada Rouge would be unbearable. Avoid at all costs.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Fine going to Vancouver, but on return there was a big delay! After 3 hours they changed the gate and got another plane - so an almost 4 hour delay.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flying AC1753 from Varadero to Toronto (connected fly) July 22 2015. Asked for a glass of water 15 minutes after taking off. It was brought 1.5 hours later, the water was not drinkable. I couldn't drink it, I gave it back to an air hostess and asked for a good one, she said yes, the water she gave me was the tap water because Air Canada Rouge do not offer bottle water to passengers, however she said she would give me a glass of bottled water as an exception.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We were a bit apprehensive about flying with Canada Rouge given the amount of criticism it gets. But it offered the best direct option from Vegas to Calgary. Our 737 flight was full, but the coordinated boarding process got everyone aboard quite quickly. Service was attentive - the FAs look over-casual, but the guy who looked after my wife was good with pillows and blanket. Perfect 10/10 landing in Calgary - complimented the co-pilot on his effort. We also flew Vancouver to LA in an upgraded 767. Again, full plane, but luggage space and legroom quite adequate. Entertainment via iPads.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
It was a 12 hour flight from Vancouver to Osaka but there was no screen for any entertainment. With a family of five with three kids under 12, this was terrible. There was an app we could download to watch movies but the selection was minimal and we did not prepare enough devices for the trip because we assumed there would be provided screens. Also, nowhere to charge your device! How do they expect us to use our own device and not charge it? Half way through the flight all the battery was gone and we were a very grumpy family. Also the plane was very old and trashy.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I would not recommend Air Canada Rouge to anyone. To start my trip I signed up for notification for cancelled or delayed flight. I got nothing but find myself sitting at the airport with a 3 hour delay. No problem, delays happen. When we were getting ready to finally board they were over booked and had to sort out that issue. I booked an early flight so I would have an extra day in Vegas. That was blown. Flight home surprise agian delay. Smaller this time but still delayed. Now when we finally land we have been at the airport for 20 min but are still sitting on the plane because there is no room for us to park. I am currently still on the run tarmac sitting in a very hot plane. This is my first and last flight with Air Canada Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Done all necessary procedure to make sure my girl would get proper assistance as she has special needs. When she got to Toronto, no wheelchair was brought to her even though AC confirmed that she would have her own at the door for the leg at the next terminal. She had to walk to the gate and no one offered help! She has cerebral palsy and walks with difficulty and very slowly. Nobody at AC wondered if the only passenger with a wheelchair had the proper service.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Worse than Air Transat. Terrible price-quality. Food disgusting. No individual screens or audio system. Must rent a tablet which is a cheap money grab. To be avoided at all costs.

Air Canada Rouge by far the worst airline I have been on, the prices you pay for a ticket and the level of comfort is unacceptable. Their business class is as good as United Airlines economy. Plus if you are 5'10 or taller you can barely fit in the seats and zero leg room.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Was worried that this would be awful but it was just fine. No issues, flight attendants were very polite, smiled and passed through the cabin 3 times during our 6 hour flight. This flight to HNL was better on Air Canada Rouge than the WestJet one we took last year. Could not beat the price.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
First time flying with Air Canada Rouge, we were flying out from Montego Bay, Jamaica to Toronto, Canada. It is approx. 4 hour flight, the seats were nice and space was plenty. I am about a 5'9 height, so it was plenty for me, but for my partner who is 6'1, he had plenty of room to stretch out and relax. The service that was unparalleled, our flight attendant was exactly what her title states - very attentive not only for myself and partner but for everybody else around her. She was very knowledgeable in regards to food menu, beverages provided and even had held her own when another passenger requested for a specific cocktail, that she knew how to whip up. This caught the requesting passenger off guard, funny moment. The complementary Ipads being offered were a nice touch, not needed but it is always nice to have options, and flying in the J cabin with Air Canada Rouge was well worth it all. My only complaint was if you were sitting in the last row in J cabin, there's a curtain to section you off from the rest of the aircraft except for a hole between you and the person beside you, ie. the arm rest area, there is a large hole for someone from behind you to peep and see through, personally, it is a minor detail but I can imagine a person who has business or work to do would appreciate the complete privacy instead of having that large gap. That being said, the service and cabin was amazing, and is highly recommended for everyone to try with Air Canada Rouge.

We flew 2 legs via AC Rouge (one 9 hours, and the other 5 hrs). The 9 hour leg we had excellent inflight service - the stewardesses were very attentive, responsive, and helpful, ensuring we had a very comfortable flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I frequently visit Las Vegas throughout the year, I thought I would give Air Canada Rouge a try. One major problem was that the day I flew there was a fuel service strike so I was delayed for over 4 hours. I frequently check my flight status especially when I leave, throughout that day I had checked at least 4 times. I only found out about it when I was at the check in counter. There was no email, no automated phone call, nothing to notify me. I was stuck waiting for hours doing nothing. When we finally got on the flight all they said was sorry. Nothing more. Not even some form of a minor compensation like refunding the baggage fee or something free on the flight. The seats were cramped, there was significantly less legroom compared to Westjet. No entertainment system whatsoever. It's 2015 and this airline operates like it's 1990 with the design of this plane. The sad part is that they can get away with this because there's absolutely no competition in this industry within Canada. Flight travel should be a stress free situation and the whole time I used this airline was such a inconvenience.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I booked our vacation package specifically because the flight attached to the Gran Bahia was flying with Air Canada and I expected to be impressed with this airline. Unfortunately, everything on Air Canada’s end was abysmal. Our flight (AC-1812), scheduled to depart from Toronto at 4.35pm was delayed five hours thus we arrived at our hotel at 5.30am and lost a huge part of the first day on our trip. We heard that the plane had mechanical problems in Cancun and was thus delayed. We were given ten-dollar vouchers for food at the airport and as a result, were not even offered snacks on the flight. Had this been the end of our poor experience with Air Canada, it would not have been a huge deal, however, our flight home (AC-1813), scheduled for 9.50pm on February 28th was cancelled completely. After our return flight was initially delayed, they had to cancel our flight to Toronto because they were missing a part for the navigation system in their plane. After both mechanical failures and massive delays, we did not feel confident that our flight would depart on time. Our flight was supposed to depart at 9.50pm on Saturday 28th of February but instead they booked a new flight at 5pm the next day. In the end, we had to book a flight home with WestJet. There was no one in the airport who could explain our options to us or help us get home on time. It would have been nice to have had some one with answers, as we were given none. We were herded back through customs for a couple of hours and when we finally got out of the airport, I still had the courtesy to tell one of them that we would not be leaving on the flight or staying at the hotel.

If you investigate Rouge in advance, and consider this to be Air Canada's vacation tier product, I think you will be fine with the level of service and comfort. I have seen complaints about the premium economy seats on these flights - these are definitely not to be compared to business class. They are larger but still economy style seats (no lie flat, no pods etc.) I have status with Air Canada (which did not do much for me on this flight except for a faster luggage drop off.) I was flying with 2 other couples and a 1 year child, for whom a seat was purchased. Seat comfort: I upgraded to a seat with more legroom (Rouge Plus - not Premium Economy, just a seat with more legroom in economy). There was sufficient legroom for the flight - better than the Air Canada Boeing 777 with 3-4-3 seating which I will not take again unless forced to. I would not fly to Europe in a Rouge regular economy seat as these are very tight. A pillow and blanket were supplied as part of the seating without extra charge. I was comfortable enough to sleep. Meals: Dinner (Chicken, quinoa salad, one roll, some kind of dessert) or pasta (did not select) is included on the flight to Lisbon outbound from Toronto as well as a slice of banana bread about 1 hour before arrival. Two or three drink services (two on the overnight flight and three during the day). Meals are included on transatlantic flights - you must pay for alcohol and only credit cards are acceptable. Quality was comparable to Air Canada Economy class,  which is to say, barely acceptable, but edible and hot. Meal on return was chicken or pasta - quality of meal was better. Snack provided was a hot chicken or vegetarian wrap. Edible. (Flew Rouge from Toronto to Las Vegas and on these flights you have to pay for food). Flight crew: Young, but very helpful especially with the baby and the car seat. Checked twice to see that the seat was approved (which is important to everyone). Service was decent. Communication: Our outbound flight was delayed 3 hours due to someone deploying an emergency chute while the plane was on the ground. Communication wasn't great but I did find out the reason by speaking nicely to a person on the desk. Announcements were made twice that we had a $10 credit to spend in the terminal on food. Not a lot, but at least we only had to show our boarding pass to get the credit, so did not have to line up for a voucher. Inflight entertainment: Runs on iPad (your own or one you can rent for $10) or some Android devices. Had no problems with Android on this trip (did have on a previous trip, so they may have fixed this). One plane had universal plug/usb outlets for charging, but one did not, so I wouldn't count on this. A reasonable selection of movies for a 7 hour flight. We all arrived safely, our luggage arrived as well, there was enough on board storage for carry on luggage now that Air Canada is enforcing the size restrictions on carry on luggage (something I approve of) and it all was relatively uneventful. Overall I would fly Rouge again but only in a Rouge Plus seat. It is convenient not to have to transfer in say Frankfurt to get to less travelled destinations in Europe like Lisbon. I like the non stop flights that are offered by Rouge. You need to understand however that this is not the top tier product and you are paying for a lesser product but not having to stop anywhere.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We travelled Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge to Italy in June/July 2015. For once, we have very positive things to say about Air Canada. Air Canada Rouge was very comfortable for the longer flights overseas - even offering meals, snacks, blankets and pillows. The inflight entertainment we used on our own Apple devices worked very well, and there was one plug in our seat area for charging. It was nice to be able to choose our seats ahead of time with no charges as well. The most positive thing we have to say about our flights is that I accidentally left my ipad mini on board our very last flight going into Halifax. The flight attendant went out of her way to turn my ipad into lost and found and even emailed me telling me this. It had ended up in St John's, NFLD, where we arranged pick up to have it returned to us. We received it a couple of days later. I am very thankful and grateful to her and the other employees in lost and found who made sure I received my ipad back! As far as I'm concerned, they went above and beyond.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Now while I like the color scheme on exterior of aircraft the rest of the experience does little for representing Air Canada. I am tired of these "low cost" airlines by the main stream airline. Those had to be some of the most uncomfortable seats we have had to endure. Window and aisle going over and middle section back YVR-HNL-YVR. In fact the middle seats were better with room. The inflight entertainment system is a joke even as I knew to download the app on my iPad but the movies and all others were old "vintage" movies from 10-20 years ago! I will do my utmost to avoid Rouge in future even for my "leisure" travel. Friends of ours were stuck in Barcelona for 9 hours due to a aircraft issue in June 2015 and co-worker was stuck in HNL for same amount of time due to same reason, I see in thread this seems to be a recurring theme (maybe the aircraft are getting to old that have been taken off the main line of AC to support Rouge). The inflight crew seemed over whelmed and those uniforms are ugly. The service was slow and I had to remind several times I pre-purchased in flight food. When I fly AC main line they seem to know by my seat assignment and mention it to me.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Lufthansa marketed the flights I purchased and I was shocked to find out in the small print that we were flying Air Canada Rouge. We flew from Newark connecting through Montreal to Rome on June 27. The return trip was Venice through Montreal to Newark on July 5. Jazz provided service on the Newark/Montreal legs. We did not experience any of the problems that other travelers mentioned. We were served hot meals that were actually good, as far as plane food goes. The plane appeared to be in good condition and clean. We downloaded the in flight app ahead of time. The movies were old and there could be a better selection. The cabin temperature was adequate. Each seat had a blanket and pillow. We saved $600 using Air Canada and were very pleased. I would definitely fly on Rouge in the future.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have traveled to Europe many times. This was the worst flight I have been on. The seats were extremely cramped and uncomfortable on an 11 hour flight. The person behind me had their knee in the small of my back. Wine was extra. Service lousy. Entertainment via wifi to your personal tablet with ten year old movies. I got told I couldn't get a extra cup of coffee because we were within an hour of landing.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
The reviews for Air Canada Rouge weren't good, so was a bit apprehensive when heading home on a Rouge flight (Rouge was the only option for the Dublin to Toronto return flight). We flew Economy (Dublin-Toronto) and it was a great flight. The flight attendants were friendly and smartly dressed. The interior cabin fabric seemed new. The seats weren't too roomy but they didn't feel too small either. The meals were standard fare for my family, decent, although my vegetarian meal (an Indian vegan dish) had to be the best meal I've ever had on any Economy flight, domestic or international. We were pretty much on-time departing and arriving. The in-flight entertainment was a bit laughable, but we had read up on it and knew that going in. It was funny to see such old Hollywood movies available on the Rouge Player (one of the movies was Never Ending Story!). I am a big fan of world movies and some of the world movies were the same as the ones on the Air Canada flight we took to London when we left on our vacation. Our family would definitely try another flight with Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I travel quite a bit and have been a fairly loyal Air Canada flyer. I don't think I even realised that Rouge was different to regular Air Canada when I booked, but I will never travel Rouge again. The seat space was tiny (if the person in front of you has their seat back and you drop something on the floor, you cannot get it - there is not enough room to bend forward to pick it up - unbelievable). There was no entertrainment system, and the food was terrible. On the way home from Dublin, we were delayed by 14 hours because the plane we were supposed to be on had trouble leaving Toronto and there was no other plane. I guess Rouge does not use other Air Canada planes - we had to wait for a Rouge plane to become free. I will never use Rouge again. The price was no different.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Boeing 767 on the way to Vegas and A319 on the way home. Boeing 767 decent in terms of space. Although we managed to get the exit row so I can't really judge the legroom in the regular seats but ours were great. Width of seats also great. Although we couldn't put our personal item (purse) under the seat so that was kind of a pain. A319 seats are decently sized in terms of width but the pitch is below industry standard. I rode the entire overnight flight with my knees pressed firmly into the back of the seat in front of me. I am only 5' 7". My boyfriend who is 5'10" found the trip excrutiating. The seat only reclines 2" so impossible to sleep. The onboard crews on both our Rouge flights to and from Vegas were excellent - friendly, helpful and pro-active. On the way back when trying to load this flight which was supposed to be done on a larger Boeing 767-300ER they anticipated the difficulty they would have with carry-on bags because there was significantly less room and dealt with it brilliantly. The check in folks in Toronto were terrible. Cranky and super unhelpful. We asked where to take our bags to check them and were dismissed with an "over that way". Well over that way was about a quarter mile down to the other end of the airport where there were no signs to guide us. We had to pay $25 for each checked bag which is ridiculous. If we had paid for a much more expensive seat we could have taken up to 2 bags free. Seriously you can't even take one suitcase for free because we're flying economy? There was no meal on the flight unless your were in Premium Rouge. We could purchase food onboard which was okay. There was a decent selection and the prices were reasonable. But again, seriously, not even a free snack on a 4 hour + flight? The planes had no in-flight entertainment except for streaming video to their app. This was okay but selection was terrible. All outdated movies and tv shows and not good classics. I'm not sure what our fare paid for. We weren't paying for a comfortable seat, for space for our baggage, food or entertainment. It seems like we paid to be uncomfortable, annoyed and bored. Why is it that basic things like having enough leg room so your legs are smashed into the seat in front of you or having a snack on a long trip is only for luxury passengers? Even when the flight is purchased entirely with aeroplan points it's not worth it.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Toronto to Abbotsford was a long flight in terms of domestic travel. About 5 hours gate to gate. While Rouge does offer in-flight entertainment for free, you need to rent an I-pad to watch movies unless you have your own. I purchased a couple of movies the night before the flight and uploaded them to my SD card for my phone. A lot of people complain about the seats on Rouge, and I somewhat agree with them. The only thing I would say that Rouge needs to improve is the overall comfort of the seats and they would be a great Low Cost Carrier. On the flight, we had 3 amazing crew. The overall flight was uneventful, and the decent into Abbotsford was amazing! I would fly Rouge again and again just for the reason that its affordable and if you do your homework, you can save yourself some money as well as have the same experience you would have a major carrier.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I was very pleased by service received at all stages of travel. Well-organised boarding, very friendly stewards, and a smooth flight. Stewards went an extra mile to make a rather lengthy flight comfortable and enjoyable. They seemed to enjoy their work too.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked through AC Vacations and my wife and I got a great deal on a package for three nights in Jamaica. For the overall value, we were actually pretty happy. I'm 6'3 and yes, the seats have a medieval aesthetic which meant the person in front literally had no chance of reclining their seat and I spent the trip with one leg in the aisle when possible. For four hours, though, I can suck it up and enjoy decent service from the 3 flight attendants. Paying for food, booze and iPads is relatively good value as well. We found it on par with Sunwing and, as always, better than United Airlines.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I will never fly Air Canada again. Before boarding, they warned us the toilet was inoperable. (Short flight, about 1.5 hours, so this is no big deal). While boarding, we had to leave our rollerboard "carry-on's" on the jetway, since the plane is too small to store them anywhere - the overhead bin is big enough for a laptop or purse. After boarding, we learned the air conditioning was half broken. I have never before been somewhere so hot and humid. Once we landed, we got to wait outside in the rain for our "carry-on" bags for 20 minutes, and several of us almost missed international connections because of this delay. In summary: no toilet, no air conditioning, and no carry-on bags.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I booked Air Canada via United website and had no idea that the flight leg from Montreal to Rome was Rouge. It was not identified on any communication. I had never heard of Rouge and I did not pay a discounted price. The experience was horrible. Hard, uncomfortable seats. No entertainment for international flight is unheard of in this day and age. They ran out of food selections and what was left was hardly edible. The worst part was the plane smelling of urine the minute one entered the cabin. Never again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I returned to Canada from Lima Peru on an Air Canada Rouge flight that left Lima at 2.15 am. Air Canada's flight arrival and departure times to Lima have always been inconvenient-arriving in Lima well after midnight, if the flight is on time, and departures for the return flight to Toronto leaving Lima at around 2 am. I returned to Canada from Lima on Air Canada in April. For my June flights regular Air Canada economy service is no longer available, only Rouge. Rouge is simply awful, unacceptable. The seats in Air Canada Rouge economy are the worst I have experienced in more than 40 years of international flying. They are narrow, with limited leg room and thin padding. The flight to Lima was bearable as I didn't try to sleep. The flight back was intolerable. Falling asleep in the seat resulted in back problems. I will not take Air Canada Rouge in the future if I can possible avoid it. There is no regular inflight entertainment system, the food was awful, although not necessarily worse than normal economy, and drinks cost extra. For entertainment you can supply your own mobile device and use the inflight service, if you don't have a device you can rent an ipad for $10. The Rouge Premium seats at the front appeared to be marginally superior to economy but come at a steep price differential. To be fair, the crew did their best, although the pilot gave little information with respect to the flight. Never again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
This will be my last flight with Air Canada Rouge. We upgraded to premium, that was a joke, 9 hours of discomfort, crowding, childish flight attendants, poor food and overall the worst flight I have been on. I have always flown Air Canada due to the part of the country we live in (other airlines are unavailable) so it would appear that I either stay home or drive to a larger center to obtain seats on another airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew from Athens to Toronto on June 11th. We think this is probably the worst airline we have flown. None of the overhead reading lights worked so reading wasn't an option. We were never I formed prior to boarding that we needed to download an app for entertainment and there is no connectivity on there is no connectivity after
boarding. Not to mention the cramped seating and lack of leg room. I can't say enough about never flying this carrier again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I think this carrier gets a very unfair rap. First flight was YVR to SFO on A319. I had no trouble fitting into my seat space. For flights of 2-3 hours it is perfectly fine. We didn't purchase any food. Return from LAX was on B767 which operates also the Osaka-YVR route. I really have no issues with Rouge unlike the parent company with whom we rounded off our latest north American trip. The entertainment on our ipad was the same as our flight from Japan, but we managed to find something.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We booked YVR-LAX return flights as we had used Air Canada before with no problems. After reading the many bad reports, I was a bit worried. However, the A319 to LAX was boarded on time, oversized baggage sent to the hold, and room for our carry-ons above our seats. Travelled in economy, with no one in front, so had no problems with the seat comfort or pitch. In fact, the seat was more comfortable than our LH Business Class, A319, LHR-FRA. Return on a B767, again on time and oversized bags removed as full flight. Seat OK, tried the Macaroni Cheese, was hot and tasty. All in all, two pleasant flights, much better than anticipated.

AC1906, 27 May. AC1919, 7 Jun. We just had two great flight Toronto to Venice - Venice to Montreal. Service was excellent - Cabin crew were jovial and attentive. I will tell you to buy the preferred seating upgrade - it will make the difference as the regular seats are close. Don't forget to bring your Tablet and load the app for Apple or Android. I was pleasantly surprised as I had only read negative reviews. The food was plentiful and tasty on the flights.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We recently took an Air Canada Rouge flight from Athens to Toronto, and once was enough: Never Again. The service was friendly and efficient, and the pilot updated us regularly on arrival info and turbulence, but there were few other positives. The seats were very cramped and uncomfortable. There were no individual monitors for entertainment, instead, passengers have to use their electronic devices or rent an I-Pad. Since my husband and I don't use electronic devices, we went old school and read whatever magazines we happened to bring with us. The food on board was terrible-worse than other food we've had on airlines. And AC Rouge charges for beer, wine, etc. All this for a price that isn't any better than other options. Next time, we'll go with the other options.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew from Toronto to Vegas in conditions that can only be equated to a cattle car. I am 5' 7 and my knees were pressed into the seat in front of me and the gent behind me had his knees in my back for 5.5 hrs! There is no way to stretch your legs or move comfortably at all. My husband and I got off the plane aching and cramped from the deplorable conditions. It is obvious that AC cares for nothing but their bottom line, and I would sooner pay more and suffer layovers than ever fly with them again. Oh and the $60 bag fee each way was an especially nice touch.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew AC Rouge from Toronto to Venice and back to Toronto from Barcelona. I'd read negative reviews about Rouge but we did not have any of the problems those reviewers mentioned. Check-in was easy the flights were on time and smooth the service was basic but fine and the price was much lower than our other options. The only negatives we encountered were (1) their web site could be better organized (and web check-in did not work on the return flight) and (2) their seats were not exactly roomy (but no worse than any other carrier). I definitely would fly Air Canada Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Just flew round trip Toronto to Bahamas on Rouge. I'm only 5'8" and couldn't believe how cramped I was. The passenger in front of me reclined his seat a bit and I could not do the same because the passenger behind me was working on her laptop. I briefly moved to business class which was almost empty but that didn't last long. I managed to watch a movie on my iPad which was okay but the selection was weak and dated. It got me there and got me back but neither flight was sold out and two more rows made it very uncomfortable for all. I couldn't imagine an overnight flight on this carrier.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew from Osaka to Vancouver on Rouge's new service. After reading all the negativity about this carrier I really did wonder if we had done the right thing. I'm happy to report that I need not have fretted I am 5'9" and fitted into an economy seat without any problem. The service was acceptable and the cabin crew young and attentive. The dinner was ok but the portion could have been bigger! Only soft drinks offered. Breakfast was a bit of a joke. A fruit yoghurt and a breakfast sandwich. Entertainment is shown on an app downloaded to your ipad prior to take-off. The app didn't download on to my samsung tablet. Flight ran pretty much to time and the journey on this 767 was a lot more comfortable than i had expected it would be. We have several flights between USA and Canada coming up and it will be interesting to see how they stand up to the negative comments.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew AC Rouge to and from Curacao from Toronto May 21st and May 28th. I would like to echo everybody else's sentiments about just how small the seats are. I'm 5'2 and found it to be a very cramped space. I cannot imagine how uncomfortable it must be for a much taller person. The headrest is useless. When the seat in front of me was reclined it was approximately a foot away. On both flights I found the planes to be very clean and the cabin crew very professional making several cabin walks throughout the flight. I used my Ipad and managed to find a couple movies to watch using the app. There didn't seem to be anything current available the movies I watched were released in 2008 and 2010. The food was your typical airline food no better or worse than I've had on other airlines. The afternoon flight to Curacao left on time and arrived on time. The return flight was approximately 9 hours late departing at midnight. Trying to get some rest in these seats is an impossible feat. This is the main reason I give my overall trip satisfaction a 2 rating. Although I'm used to paying for food and alcohol on flights I was completely taken aback to be charged for a sandwich after a 9 hour delay. I guess that's AC for you. As for if I would travel AC Rouge again possibly during a daytime flight if the cost was significantly less than a regular airline. If it were a red eye I would pay to upgrade or choose another airline to fly with.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Toronto to Varadero and back. It is unbelievable how much they are willing to test the patience of their travelers. I'm only 5'5 and I found the seats to be extremely cramped. I could barely handle the 3.5 hour flight - I don't know how people handle a 7-8 hour flight. While the staff were helpful and friendly I was shocked that you have to pay for food and alcohol pay for a blanket and pay for on board entertainment. Why are we moving backwards. I remember the time when there used to be one large screen for an entire section then we progressed to individual entertainment systems and now we aren't back to square one - but we have regressed! If you are going to start cutting corners like this then at least reduce the airfare! What is Air Canada thinking? Never again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My wife and I and friends just flew Montreal to Las Vegas return with them. I am a large man with long legs I fit in a normal seat width-wise but I cannot pretzel my legs sufficiently to deal with the lack of legroom. Because of this I reserved and paid extra for one of the extra-legroom seats on the emergency door seat 18F to be exact. Air Canada Rouge happily accepted my money and emitted the corresponding receipt but on obtaining my boarding pass I discovered I had been reassigned to 15A which on boarding the plane I discovered was a normal "meat packer" seat while someone else had been given 18F. It turns out that their business practice is to sell those seats to anyone but they only actually assign them to passengers at the check-in counter. To avoid a repeat we showed up for our return flight 10 minutes before the check-in counter opened. We were first in line yet my reserved and paid for extra-legroom seat had already been assigned to someone else. This is shoddy way to do business. I can understand that seats on the emergency aisle should only be assigned to passengers who will be able to help if they are called upon to operate the emergency door (something which I am perfectly able to do) and therefore should only be assigned at check-in but that being the case why allow someone to pay for and reserve one in advance when the reality is that they are assigned on a first come first serve basis by the staff at the check-in counter?

May 18 2015. Barcelona to Toronto. Forced to take Rouge from Air Canada since that's what they use. Cancelled the non-stop flight on the Sunday and moved us to the Monday non-stop. Had to come on the Sunday so ended up going by way of Montreal. Was charged an additional $90 for seats with some leg room. No entertainment on a 9 hour flight. If you wanted to see something you either had your own tablet etc. or you can get an I-pad from them for $10. Food was so-so. Check in counter at Barcelona Airport was a disaster. They don't have kiosk where you can check in and print your boarding passes and luggage tags. After about an hour in line I was finally able to check in on line and proceed to the separate line to check your bags. 4th in line took 25 minutes. By the time we finally got through all the lines (Security & Immigration) we had 20 minutes to run to the gate. By the way the airport was in total disarray and major staff shortages for the thousands that were in the terminal. Everyone was being fed into 2 lines at each point. Almost had to take the Monday flight after all.

Flew YVR-OGG (Maui) return this month with my husband (6') while I am 5'4". We had seats 42H and 42K. On the outward bound flight the air was blasting so much I was frozen and to make matters worse I was suffering with a pinched nerve in my neck. I was unable to put my head at the correct height on the head rest for any support as I am too short to reach it. I couldn't lean against the window (even though I had my own pillow and a special neck support collar) as there was a gap which my pillow would fall through. The return flight was even worse starting with check in at the airport. If you haven't done web check-in which isn't always possible while on holiday you have to wait in line while those people who have take their baggage to the agents. They had 3 lines one for priority one for web check-in and one for everyone else. There were 4 desk agents dealing with passengers. The flight was a red-eye and I was prepared for the blasting cold air but my husband had to borrow my scarf to cover his face and head because he was freezing. The flight crew tried hard but they are really not very professional. I never used the inflight entertainment option because using and iPhone or iPad was not something I could do with my neck issue. I had no idea when I made my reservation that there was no seat back entertainment. That has always been one of the Air Canada pluses - they have great movies. The only thing I can is the flights were on time both ways but that is no excuse for this poor show. What is Air Canada thinking? I have always flown them by choice and supported them. Their regular airline is great and their overseas business class for Europe is my first choice all things considered. I will never fly Air Canada Rouge again.

Had a bad experience on the flight from Athens to Toronto on 5/24/2015. The service was slow no entertainment information prior to flight. 13 hours on the flight and had to movies TV shows because you need an Air Canada App to be able to view. Food was horrible and it was the first flight overseas by a major carrier that we had to pay for wine or any alcoholic beverages. But the biggest disappointment was the service of the staff. Never again will I spend the money to fly this airline.

No onboard entertainment unless you've downloaded their app (good luck finding that). Horrible seating I'm 5'4"' and my knees were jammed into the seat in front. I got massive leg swelling because there is no room to stretch your legs. Service is non-existent - you have to go to the back to even get water from the attendants. Food beyond awful. Lunch was a pasta with no sign of veggies a bread roll something that was supposed to be a potato salad with 1 olive on top and little sign of potato and a cookie. 4 carbs no fruit and no veg? This was advertised as a Lufthansa flight operated by Air Canada it wasn't a discount fare and we didn't know it was a Rouge flight until we boarded. Never again! Shame on you Air Canada! These flights were Lufthansa 6625 May 10 and Lufthansa 6624 May 24. Wonder if Lufthansa knows that AC is destroying its reputation with this dreadful service.

Flew from Toronto to Lima. Flight was a half an hour delayed which is ok. Very little leg room. We requested vegetarian meals which were frozen when they arrived on our seats something that I think is unacceptable. Flight attendants did not speak Spanish which again is unacceptable when all other airlines flying to South America have staff that can speak Spanish. Definitely a downgrade from Air Canada for the same amount of money. Finally there is no entertainment system except for the Air Canada app which features a handful of old movies again very much downgraded product from Air Canada.

I flew Toronto to Dublin return April 21 and May 8 2015. After reading negative reviews I was expecting the worst. However both flights were excellent. Both on time. I think that paying extra for Premium makes the difference-well worth it. The two-seat configuration with only 24 passengers in Premium provided plenty of room. Blanket pillow and kit bag were already on the seat when we boarded. Water and juice were offered as we sat down. Flight attendants were courteous attentive professional. Menu provided two selections for each of the two meals. Hot wash cloths before dinner newspapers iPad for movies all offered. The seats were comfortable leg room satisfactory (I am 5'4"). Pilot communicated about any expected turbulence and managed to keep it to a minimum. A very positive experience. Only negative - on return flight the check-in clerk neglected to label my bag Priority and therefore resulted in a longer wait at baggage carousel. Next time I will simply ask if the tag has been attached to the bag.

I used Rouge to fly from Toronto to Tampa and i was shocked what horrible leg room there was. The Cabin crew had nice uniforms however the service was rude and slow. The crew just assumed everyone was discount flyers who were used to horrible conditions. I will never fly this airline again. There should be some minimum standards for leg room and this airline does not meet that standard. The inflight entertainment was 5 years out of date but at least it worked to my laptop.

Took AC Rouge to/from Toronto-Las Vegas (Business class). Returned today May 18th. Flights left/arrived on time. Outbound crew was attentive professional and personable. Inbound team was 'average'. Ran out of 'healthy' food choice (despite the fact that bus class passengers paid higher fares). Massive confusion on the return flight (5 people booked in same seat). Biggest problem (as is often the case with Air Canada): baggage (again return flight). Passengers with checked luggage were sent to the wrong carousel and waited nearly 1 hour before a passenger located the correct one - with no help explanation or apology from Air Canada ground staff. Tight seating even in Bus. class. Free iPad with higher fare (my husband used one I didn't) with good in-flight entertainment.

I flew from Montreal to Athens. Although the flight arrived on time the 9 hours in the plane were a nightmare. Seats extremely small staff inexperienced and rude food horrible entertainment non-existent cabin dirty and smelly and they charge extra for things such as a simple glass of wine. I will never fly with Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada are a disgrace. Flew from Vancouver to London. I was astounded at how little leg space there was for passengers and I'm short myself (5'6). It is simply impossible to get out of your seat if somebody is asleep. It is simply inhuman to put people into such cramped conditions for nearly nine hours. I don't know how they are allowed to get away with this. Are there no regulations governing minimum legroom on aircraft. You wouldn't transport animals like this.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We booked a family Hawaiian vacation with our two kids aged 8 and 10 I chose the Air Canada Rouge because of the price. We chose to upgrade to premium Rouge seating for an additional fee of $400 round trip. We flew AC1831 May 6 to Honolulu - Boeing 767. Coming from Edmonton and connecting in Vancouver all flights were on time the cabin staff were vibrant and friendly. The seating while not luxurious was within means of comfort (my husband is 6 ft and I 5' 5") and was larger than our previous flight to Hawaii with another airline in February. The aircraft was clean as were the bathrooms. There was an oversize bathroom on our aircraft which was good for parents with young kids or larger people that I had not seen on other aircraft's. The rental for ipads at $10 was a real treat for my kids - kept our kids busy the entire flight. Though we did not purchase meals on board the food that was for purchase was reasonably priced and looked nice. All of our flights arrived on time. The aircraft was a bit on the cool side however this seems to be common among all airlines. Additionally I would have preferred the cabin lights be dimmed during the entire flight at night for sleep purposes since we were flying overnight. Rouge afforded us very good value and service.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flight 835 MCO-YYZ. Flew on them a few months back and I must say I was not impressed. Reading all the other reviews I assume that all the good ones were written by people shorter than 5'5. With its cool new cabin layout and the stylish cabin attendant uniforms it could easily be someone's favorite airline but with the drastic decrease in leg room I cant see myself flying them again. There was so little leg room I had to sit in the bathroom for the last hour of the flight. I am never flying them again not until Rouge goes belly up and the regular Air Canada flights start coming back to the Bahamas.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Traveled from YVR to HNL and back 5 hrs air time and 6 hrs gate to gate. To be fair with Rouge they are not as bad as the 1 or 2 star ratings here suggest. Yes they don't have built in entertainment system on their plane and they charge for everything such as snacks food and blankets. Services takes a long time and they are not willing to serve you even water until it's the scheduled time but I'd still give them a 5/10 for on time flights both ways and they do have average economy seats.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Toronto-Athens May 10. On the plus side the flight left and arrived on time. The in-flight experience was horrible. Seat pitch is so tight that my husband and I (5'5" and 5'4") were very cramped. No entertainment unless you have their app otherwise you have to rent an iPad for $10. They don't tell you in advance that you need the app. No service for the first 2 hours in the air then they came around with soft drinks never came round with these again. The only after-dinner choices were coffee tea or water. Food was awful. Neither of our overhead lights worked and my switch worked the light for the lady at the end of our 3-seat row. I've flown discount airlines before but have never felt as I did on this that I was an inconvenience. I will never fly Rouge again I didn't know when I booked the flight that it was a Rouge one - I will double-check in future. Air Canada has lost me as a customer.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Toronto to Dublin on May 3rd. Booked emergency row 28 for extra legroom which was well worth it - however it was extremely cold in this row for the entire flight. Choice of 2 meals-chicken or pasta for dinner and banana bread and a coffee for breakfast. Rented an I pad for in flight entertainment and it was fine. Crew were OK- nothing sensational or terrible. Offering duty free 25 minutes before landing was somewhat late. Flight smooth and on-time but it is an older 767 and I would no fly Rouge unless I had the extra legroom I paid for ($90.) Baggage 2 days late however this was not Rouge's fault but Air Canada mainline connections from Halifax to Ottawa to Toronto before the flight to Dublin.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We had a May 10 premium economy booking from Athens to Toronto at 13.00 in the afternoon. At 9.30 that morning we received a cryptic message from Air Canada apologizing for the flight disruption. We telephoned Toronto to find out that in actuality it had been cancelled due to 'overcrowded airspace'. We were fortunate enough after two phone calls to be able to rebook through London. It was simply listed as 'delayed' and as we boarded outer London flight at 1.30 it was still listed this way. They were as it tip urns out eventually rolled over to the next day 13.00 flight. This is not right not to have informed us all about the flight being cancelled. I do not think I will attempt a Rouge flight again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Trip was from Dublin to Toronto to Vancouver and back to London all on Air Canada. In trying to bypass London on the way out we were booked on the first ever flight of Rouge from Dublin. It was several hours late food was awful staff were snipey leg room was non existent and there was no entertainment. My biggest complaint is that despite multiple correspondences with Rouge and Air Canada I have not had one word from them other that to say 'it's my own fault for not realising how bad it would be'. I have to make the same trip again shortly and am exploring every possible way of doing it without any flights on Rouge or Air Canada. This is very sad since I am a Canadian Citizen. Rouge should take note thousand's of people (who are complaining) are not idiots - time you wised up.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Toronto to Tampa return flight. Friendly service with attendants coming through cabin to offer refreshments (only took free beverage as I had my own snacks) and pick up garbage. Cabin temperature comfortable and seats firm but tolerable. No issue with leg room as I am only 5 ft 3 in but little room to move. Both flights left on time and arrived a bit early. Cabin was very clean and best of all we arrived safely! I was very sceptical about Rouge because of past reviews but for a very quick flight to Florida (just under three hours) - great value. Gave entertainment a "1" because I didn't use it and there is no option on this survey for "not applicable".

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I purchased exit row seats ($20 seat selection + $60 "preferred" seating + taxes each way = $168) for my round trip Toronto-San Diego. I was mighty glad to have the exit row window seat on my outbound flight - even so I felt squished in like a sardine and had to keep my left arm folded over so as to keep the intimacy between myself and the poor man squished in/overflowing from the middle seat next to me from becoming completely indecent for 5+ hours. I checked in online for my inbound flight the night before but it was only when I got to the airport yesterday to check my bag that I discovered I no longer had preferred seating. In Air Canada's defence they advised that they had changed aircraft and the people that had bulkhead seats were given the exit row seats. So where did that leave me? In a middle/centre seat. Right beside the seat I had paid for. The fairly generous 4-star rating of the AC Rouge staff below was for the flight attendants only who were pleasant. Air Canada's motto should be "We take the Service out of Customer Service". Ground staff were completely nonchalant about the fact that I no longer had the seat I paid for. Oh and don't forget to download the AC app before you fly or you won't have any inflight entertainment. Well unless you rent one of AC's iPads.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew what you call business-class on Air Canada rouge from Montreal to Las Vegas had I known that the entertainment was a simple iPad or that seats were so small that a midget would find it tight or that the seats were made so hard that it felt like a piece of plywood and would hardly reclined never to say that their service was lousy for all these great reasons I would recommend everyone never to use Air Canada rouge.

We flew with Air Canada Rouge April 24th and May 1st 2015. We travelled from Toronto to Curacao (return trip). Both flights were excellent and smooth. Best landing I have ever experienced! Flight crew were very professional and helpful to all peoples' needs. I strongly recommend and will fly with this airline again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Have flown the Toronto - Dublin route a few times now overall it wasn't a bad experience food was decent (included) free non alcoholic drinks offered continuously the staff very good washrooms maintained seat room as good as most and entertainment provided via your own iPad (download app ahead of time) quite good and changed regularly and there is power every other seat to share. Cons: There is no personal air flow so cabin can get quite hot but the staff are pretty good at turning down the temp once you say something. The inflight entertainment does not have any info connected to the flight progress. Have to use credit card to pay for anything on the flight like alcohol iPad rental or duty free.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew YVR to LAX (Airbus). Flight attendants were rude told me they couldn't help me put my carry on bag in the overheard compartment. I had to stomp on my bag for it to even go between my seat and the seat in front. Being the in window seat I was now stuck in my seat and am stuck with my bag half under the seat in front of me and half not with straps tangled at my feet. There was trash (used napkins/newspaper) in the pocket where the normal TVs would go. I am 5'4" and my knees was almost touching the seat in front. I took out my laptop in hopes to stream the inflight entertainment pulled down the tray table and realized my laptop did not fit the table. Drinks came around and I had to deny my free drink because I had no room to put the drink down or to move or juggle a drink and a laptop. To my dismay my efforts of getting into a working seat position my streaming froze so I gave up and decided to take a nap. But a nap was impossible as they left all their cabin lights on for a 8.30pm-11.15pm flight and I was beginning to have a headache from the light. I had to wait until everyone was off the plane so I could shimmy my bag out from under the seat and slide it out from the window seat to the aisle. Flew a US airline on the way back and it was paradise compared to AC Rouge. If you really do wish to fly rouge I would personally pack an ipad mini that is already loaded with movies an eye mask and sports tape or ice/heat pack for your knees. Heck even bring a cushion because those seats are not comfortable whatsoever but that said cushion may also compromise with what little space you already have. And for goodness sake be kind don't recline your seat.

April 19 AC 1838 YYC-PHX. Return on April 24 AC1839 PHX-YYC. The seat pitch is horrible! I am only 5' 4" and felt squashed! I can't imagine how my husband would have fit had he been flying with me. I will not fly this airline again. I flew Calgary to Phoenix. Had no choice if you want to fly Air Canada to Phoenix you must fly Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We boarded the plane expecting the worst. It was the same as any other discount carrier for the most part. The seats were average. My husband is 6'3 and we usually try to get exit row seats. It seems that on Rouge the exit row is considered premium seating and is an extra $250ish per person! His knees were hitting the seat in front of him but that's to be expected. We were really disappointed with the entertainment situation. The app that you are to download doesn't work for android. It will play music but no movies or TV shows. There are plugs between the seats which is nice but they are on the ground and we couldn't actually reach them because the seats were so cramped. Charging for checked luggage has made most people use carry-on which means that there isn't enough room for all the bags in the cabin. All the reasons that we used to like Air Canada are gone. We will not be flying Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Recently flew with Air Canada Rouge from Vancouver to Honolulu and Maui to Vancouver. After reading all the bad reviews I was really apprehensive about flying with them. However there is nothing to complain about the staff on both flights was attentive and courteous drinks were served twice during the flights in between the flight attendants came round with water. There is little legroom and the seats are not the most comfortable ones but the plane was clean as were the bathrooms. I cannot comment on the food or the entertainment program since I brought my own. People around me seemed happy with the food they had purchased on the plane. I would definitely fly Air Canada Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
While I am 6'4" I am hardly a giant and I cannot sit in the seats without my knees pushing into the seat in front. I was not informed at booking that it was a Rouge flight but I will avoid at all costs. I do not mind stripping amenities to reduce cost but making the seats so awful is ridiculous. What is this an airline for ants?

### Air Canada rouge customer review
April 18 2015 HNL-YVR was delayed 4 hours which I've since learned is quite normal for Rouge. Passengers in the waiting lounge mentioned getting "roughed" previously to which all say "this won't happen again done with Rouge". Seats are horrible cabin temp uncomfortable lights stayed on for entire flight food non-existent in any form inflight entertainment dates back to 80's and flight attendants lacking in training and experience. This Low Cost Experiment by AC is a failure.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
This was our first time flying with Air Canada Rouge (from Vancouver to Maui and return). We had read the reviews of Air Canada Rouge and they were so horrible that we were really apprehensive about flying with them. However we did not experience many of the bad things other people seem to have experienced. One of us has a mobility disability and we had excellent service from the staff in the airport who met us with a cart and took us through from one end to the other. The plane was a half hour late leaving Vancouver as we were waiting for some passengers coming from a connecting flight that was late. Our take off on the way home was however right on time. The plane was clean. The staff were young but they were friendly and attentive on both flights. The food wasn't great but it was adequate. We rented an ipad and watched a movie on the flight to Maui the entertainment was adequate. We only had two complaints: Firstly the communication over the intercom was poor quality and the information was relayed so quickly we could not understand a word they were saying. Secondly the seats were extremely uncomfortable. There was virtually no space between our knees and the seats in front of us. Our seats were also very narrow. This total lack of legroom makes for an uncomfortable flight especially on an all-night flight when you are trying to sleep. We would recommend Air Canada Rouge to others as it is more affordable but we would qualify our recommendation with the above pros and cons.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Have flown Rouge several times. The biggest issue in my opinion is seat pitch. I have been in Rouge and Rouge Plus. I won't fly with them if Rouge Plus is not available (only six seats on an A319). It also means they aren't much of a discount carrier if you have to add $40+ per seat in addition to the already higher fares. I am based in Halifax so a connection is the norm for me anyway. This makes the US carriers more attractive. Increase the seat pitch and a lot of the complaining will go away.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew rouge from YUL to Las Vegas on April 19th 2015 (flight 1855) and I was pleasantly surprised. Plane left late but not too bad and crew was wonderful. I would have recommended it to anyone but on the way back April 23rd (flight 1856) it was a scene from a high school musical. The flight attendants could not have been more self absorbed teenagers. Worst on board service in my 47 years of flying. They were talking in the back for 4.5 hours. I couldn't even get a glass of water. Air Canada Rouge should have 1 older flight attendant that can get them to do some work.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
When we booked our flight it said nothing about it being Rouge as opposed to Air Canada. Needless to say we were extremely disappointed when we found out as we opted not to pack our Ipad and it's the only way to access inflight entertainment without paying. Our family's seat assignment on the way had one of us in front of the bulk head while the other three of us were behind it (which was not so bad). Even worse - almost everyone on the flight back was given seats one behind the other. Our 6 year old was given a seat by herself! Everyone in the plane had to jockey their seats to be with the people they were actually traveling with. Ridiculous to say the least. This is not the first time we fly AC Rouge (both economy and premium economy) and none of the experiences have been great. It's not the staff as they are very friendly and accommodating its the actual aircraft. Terrible!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Ranked one of the worst airlines in the world easy to see why. I've flown Rouge once and I'll never do it again. 29" seat pitch (distance from seat to seat front to back) caused serious pain for myself and several other average-sized men on the plane. I can't imagine what would happen to someone who's actually tall. Talking to the Flight Attendants even they hate being on these planes as they put it "it's a non-stop stream of unhappy passengers". Avoid Rouge at all costs.

We were on Air Canada Rouge flight from Toronto to Cuba and return flight was same. We are very disappointed with our flight experience with Rouge. No leg room no complimentary meals or beverages. Staff did their best to keep customers well served. There is more leg room in the Dash 8 that we took from Toronto to Timmins than the 319 we had from Toronto to Cuba. In the Future will make every effort to book with other airlines instead of with Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We were put on the AC1845 booked through Expedia the portion from Whitehorse to Vancouver was fine then AC Rouge to Phoenix made me think twice about ever flying again. On return we flew United to SFO great plane lots of leg room comfortable. SFO to Vancouver was a nightmare my knees still hurt and while I have never been an AC fan Rouge was the final straw. Nice looking uniforms does not a comfortable flight make. We were cramped no room for carry on. Almost claustrophobic temp hot seat lumpy and wedged between back and my knees. I am 6.1 could barely stand up after flight. I like the configuration United had 1st class then a number of rows with more space a number of rows with less leg room and then standard economy for the little people. I would be happy to pay a little more for the extra leg room or I may just drive the next time.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew Air Canada Rouge Toronto to Phoenix. I'm 5' 11 and had no legroom at all legs were tight for two days after. On the way back I upgraded my seat to row 4 right behind 'first class' get more room. Room was a bit better for and extra $40 but the flight attendant in first class was unbelievable. 5 of 18 seats were empty but she would not allow for anyone to take a pillow for use - this was a red eye flight. She actually reached over the seat from empty row 3 and pulled it from the window seat passenger and then woke up his wife to take the one she was using. Then she was rude about it when asked why. Inflight entertainment was awful- besides inconsistent connection- many had it reset several times- the content was bad. Bad leg room bad service and bad inflight entertainment. I'll never fly Rouge again.

YUL-HOG HOG-YUL 4/11 Apr 2015. We flew this leg same time last year (2014) and that flight was a "real" Air Canada flight not Rouge. This flight was a shock. I am 6'5" so used to being a bit cramped on aircraft but ACR take it to a new level. The leg room is appalling I read about going long-haul to Edinburgh on this airline and would not consider it as 4 hours to Cuba was more than enough. The inflight entertainment was a waste of time the meals offered seemed pretty poor but the worse of all of this flight was the seating comfort. Future flights to Cuba will be with WestJet - AC have lost me as a frequent flier if this kind of cost cutting is their "new" business method.

Flew AC Rogue from Toronto to HNL round trip first of April 2015. The flight was as good as any I have been on in the US (we are from the US) and otherwise. The seats were fine the food for purchase good the crew attentive and the service overall good to great. Infight entertainment worked just fine and btw there were pillows and blankets on every seat. Bathrooms fully operational and clean. I will fly Rogue anytime. The service is good and should take advantage of the prices. The price alone beat any of my US options by 300.00 pp.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew on Air Canada Rouge last month from Toronto to Phoenix return. While this was our first experience with Rouge having had tremendous negative feedback about the very limited leg room my husband and I decided to upgrade to preferred seating before we left on our trip. The preferred seating was better than the regular seating for sure. However while we paid $160 extra to upgrade our seats our boarding zone did not change. This meant that we boarded the aircraft last because our reservation was booked using points. When we actually did board the aircraft the overhead bins near our row were all full. It seems reasonable to me that when a person upgrades to preferred seating at an additional cost they should board right after business class passengers and before regular seating. Until Air Canada discontinues the practice of having passengers pay for their one checked bag onboard storage space will continue to be a huge problem. When I paid extra to have preferred seating I would have expected preferred service!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew YYZ to HNL round trip from on the 11th and 24th May. Came in with full expectations of the plane being a cramped mess with no power at the seats iron bars sticking in my back and basically no service. What we experienced was pretty much the opposite. Typical flight knew about the entertainment so came prepared had lots of food power at the seats decent service no bar in the back. We upgraded to the extra leg room (premium?) seats and I know that made a difference for me. Ultimately the trip to and from HNL was a total non-event just as it should have been. Based on the expectations we had coming in they were wildly exceeded. Maybe we got lucky with a refurbished plane but if this is the norm for AC Rouge then the norm is just fine. They should still be discounted more if they are going to call themselves a discount carrier though. I won't hold my breath for that.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We have just returned from our eighth trip from Toronto to Grenada. This was our first trip on Rouge. The plane was the Airbus 319. The flights have left us scarred. There is no legroom and on a 5.5 hour flight no complimentary meal. We did download the Air Canada app for inflight entertainment but didn't find anything current or worth watching. This was our worst inflight experience ever! When I went online to understand the Rouge economy seat pitch (measurement of legroom) it does not mention it and I now understand why. There were 118 seats in the economy section and there may have been 5 empty seats at most based on what I saw. There were 2 stewardesses which I believe contravenes the 50 passengers to 1 stewardess legislation. Also there were only 2 toilets for the 2 crew in economy and all of the economy passengers. When a crew member had to wash their hands the washroom was the only place to do it. I would not call this "leisure" flying. Unfortunately for us this will be our last trip to Grenada unless the carrier changes or they re-fit the planes. Everyone at the resort we talked to was complaining about Rouge. The only positive thing I can say is the crew were very pleasant and helpful and I pity them because so many people were unhappy with the cramped quarters. Some men were actually sitting sideways for the entire flight because there was not enough legroom. Never again!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Trip consisted of two flights Winnipeg to Vancouver and from Vancouver to Maui. The shorter flight from Winnipeg to Vancouver was onboard an Embraer 190. In economy there was adequate room to sit you could lower the table tray and if the person in front of you tilted their seat back it did not hit you in the face. The entertainment system the same one that has been used by Air Canada for a number of years provided a number of new or relatively new Hollywood movies. Once on the Rouge flight from Vancouver to Maui that all changed. The plane was a 767-300 which they have crammed more seats in over the regular 767-300. The seats seem thinner and more upright. My knees were touching the back of the seat in front. They have moved away from providing screens in the seat back facing you instead you have to provide your own screen a tablet laptop phone etc. Then you have to make sure you have loaded their“app”to play any content. Movies TV shows etc are broadcast via wifi. The older system on the first plane had four times the selection. Unlike the older system which is available even before the flight takes off this one was not online until about 40 minutes after we were in the air. On a flight that long a single charge on a devices battery is not going to last. When checking in for the flight home also Rouge from Maui to Vancouver I opted to upgrade the seats to ones promoted as having more legroom. Seats in the emergency aisle were advertised as such. For addition $60 per seat I selected them. More legroom was a lie. These were the seats right behind the toilets so even though there was more space between my knees and the wall in front of me there was nowhere to stretch my feet out whatsoever. There was no power outlet available. Being right by the toilets there was constant traffic and often unpleasant smells. I have been on overnight flights with Air Canada before a few times and always in the past to help make the passengers more comfortable and improve the odds of sleeping pillows and blankets were offered. Well on this Rouge flight none were offered and as the cabin did grow cooler and I inquired about them I was told that they were available for purchase! In all credit to the crew they just gave me a small one. The crew were friendly and helpful the plane itself looked long in the tooth. I have patronized Air Canada and chose them over other airlines for over 30 years but will I continue to do so? With this kind of service I don't think so.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We just completed round trip Toronto to Phoenix on AC Rouge - terrible! Seats are very small service is minimal boarding very slow because too much overhead baggage is allowed for first passengers on board. We stood in the jetway for more than 20 minutes waiting for staff to sort out baggage - unnecessary! Just enforce your own rules. A very poor alternative to reg. AC service. - bring it back please!

I did not know that our flight from Phoenix to Calgary was Rouge. I had been warned about it and was not impressed. I dropped something and was not able to pick up because there was no room. My husband's knees were pressing the seat in front. The flight attendants were serious. It was difficult for people to use their iPads. Not a pleasant experience and will not use it again.

Flew San Diego - Toronto route on Rouge. When I got in my seat literally had to get claustrophobia under control and I am not normally claustrophobic. Took out my laptop to watch a movie and the person ahead put their seat back and in the process almost wrecked the computer screen. Absolutely no room for a computer. There was no room for my legs had to sit with them crosswise. Measured the distance between seats the width of my eyeglasses plus two inches. Service was fine but my knees were so sore on landing it was almost a half hour before I could walk without pain and again I usually don't have sore knees. Fine to cut costs but you still have to leave room for the passengers please! Always loved and flew Air Canada but will avoid Rouge whenever possible and will now consider other carriers.

Appalling trip to Phoenix. Even at 5'6 my knees were crushed against seat ahead. No inflight entertainment endless queues for the two tiny bathrooms - for 120+ people? People lined up the length of the plane leaning on everyone's back rest as they waited to gradually make their way to a coveted toilet! My ill son needed a wheelchair to meet our flight in Toronto. Message didn't get through and we waited endlessly as crew asked us to leave the plane. Frequent flyer points be damned. Hello Westjet.

My wife and I flew the Toronto-Cancun route 3 times this season. (AC10-11) and were pleasantly surprised. When Rouge began operating this service I wrote a very negative review. I believe they have listened and are trying. My biggest complaint from the beginning was the insane seating discomfort. The new plane flying this route is a 767 and it is quiet clean maintained very well and the seating is very comfortable. The crew do their best and I have no problems with them whatsoever. Sometimes the flights were delayed but all in all we arrived safe and in good shape. That's all I ask of any airline when push comes to shove. The little nitpicky stuff pales beside safety and the incredible shape and performance of the aircraft and pilots gets us all back home. I am liking this route now and will not hesitate to purchase from Rouge. I think they should be applauded for righting a wrong.

I just returned from Maui flying the only Air Canada option - Rouge. Never again if I can possibly avoid it even after being a dedicated AC client for over 25 years. If I was 5 foot 6 inches or smaller it might have been somewhat okay comfort wise. No in flight entertainment and nice but inexperienced attendants. Obviously a strategy to operate at a low cost but fairs do not correlate. Very disappointed.

I am a 75k elite member on Air Canada routes I would normally have flown Air Canada on I will switch to WestJet or a US airline. Great way to loose loyal customers Air Canada. I had to change a flight that now routed me through LA to Vancouver the last leg on Rouge. The seats were so uncomfortable and perhaps the tightest fit I have experienced when not in a private prop plane. I will never fly Rouge again and think about no longer flying with Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew the HNL-YYZ route on Air Canada rouge on our recent trip to Hawaii (we were originally booked on a Delta flight but decided to stay an extra week so ended up flying rouge home as it was the cheapest fare at the time) and like some of the reviewers wrote I was a little worried about this flight having read the reviews. Our flight was surprisingly drama-free and better than expected. Aside from the fact that the 767 was the same aircraft I flew to London (UK) with 9 years ago the cabin looked like it was given a new interior. Having known about the lack of food (to be honest none of the major North American airlines with the exception of Hawaiian Airlines will offer free meal service for economy passengers to and from Hawaii - ridiculous yes but that's a whole other battle) we brought our own food on the flight. Sure there wasn't PTV's or even an overhead screen however I did my due diligence and on the rouge website it does tell passengers to download the app to access the in-flight entertainment system. I was pretty impressed by the selection - new and old offerings. The cabin crew were young and did their job well. The seats were fine - typical seating in economy class on a domestic/US flight. We took the red-eye home (left HNL at 11pm) so we slept for most of the flight. All in all a normal flight that got us home 45 minutes early. One thing that people need to realize is that this is really Air Canada's "discount" version and as such I wouldn't get your hopes up too high about amenities when it comes to economy. Having travelled on many US airlines to and from Hawaii this was not bad. You want bad? Try American Airlines - the aircraft they used from DFW-HNL (and back!) was literally transported from the 80's. They didn't even bother to retrofit the interior cabin. From the cabin walls (with the tacky 80's floral design) to the video they used on the overhead screen (the on screen employees looked like they came from an early 90's MTV music video with the scrunchies and tacky shoulder pads). The flight was delayed from DFW. While it does put a damper on your Hawaiian vacation when the flight is less than perfect I would say rouge is a good and budget friendly option to get to paradise. Just make sure you know what to expect and be prepared and you'll be fine. Unfortunately you really can't ask for much nowadays when it comes to North American airlines and their "domestic" economy class system. If you want the amenities - I would highly suggest upgrading if budget allows and/or you have enough points to do so and fly Delta. Our flight from ATL-HNL in economy was the best experience - I could just imagine how heavenly their business/first class was on that flight. New Airbus with PTV's on every seat. While no free meal service in economy they offered four rounds of beverage service AND gave everyone a Hawaiian Host chocolate prior to landing in HNL as a "first Aloha".

The A319 was nicely appointed clean and lavatory serviced nicely. The crew are often the brunt of criticism but on this flight (3/16 YYZ-PHX) I couldn't praise the crew more. They were attentive two beverage passes and light meal cart and regular trips down the aisle with water for this 5 hour flight to PHX. Although young they seemed like they are really grasping the job and did so like other seasoned professionals on the big daddy airline - AC. For a leisure airline there is nothing leisurely about the experience. There is no inflight entertainment to speak of and the seating (oh the reviews about the seating) is absolutely horrible. Please Air Canada do something about the position of the seats - it's too tight! I would recommend Rouge for a trip of 3 hours or less. Do not book Rouge no matter how cheap you think it's going to cost for flights over 3 hours. Toronto to Jamaica - fine Vancouver to Vegas - fine. Otherwise it's an option but not priced well. For the product the price point is still too high. But good work on resolving some of the issues with the flight attendant "kids" that I've heard so much about. Air Canada please listen to me lighten up on the seating provide some fun on board like TV's and turn the product into a fun place to be.

I have been Super Elite on Air Canada for many years but this now comes to an end. The change to Rouge service for popular destinations from Vancouver is the reason. I cannot fit in the economy despite being slim and fit. My legs don't fit!. I flew the business class and it was disgusting. Terrible food and kids providing service. I have switched to Alaska and West Jet as a result. I will also note that the new business class seats on Air Canada long haul service are the worst I have ever experienced. There is no room to extend your legs and the tray is impossible to figure out.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Experienced Rouge for the first time this week while traveling to the US on business. The outgoing flight was late and I missed the connection. Seating is uncomfortable and cramped. There is no seatback entertainment systems and the wireless system has a very limited selection of old material. I don't get the impression that I was paying less for the flights. The leg that I flew on United was much better in terms of comfort and service and being on- time. Since I booked the flights on the Air Canada website in future I will first check to see if there are options on foreign carriers. AC and Rouge can pursue those who occasionally travel on vacation.

Despite other reviews I was very happy using services of Air Canada Rouge. Travelled March 8 2015 to March 15 2015 Toronto to Honolulu round-trip. Very good impression of them I'll use their services again for sure. The inflight entertainment was very good 120V plugs is excellent. Entertainment software work great for Android devices as well. Very friendly team on board excellent take off and landings.

I flew from YVR-HNL on March 6th and was assigned the one lonely seat right at the back of the plane in row 51. I asked the gate agent politely if there was any chance he could move me up. He was helpful and moved me up to Row 21 where there was an empty seat. The in-flight entertainment was ok for the 6+ hours flight enough to get me there (because I can't sleep on planes.) I was also starving halfway through the flight but wasn't interested in pay $13.50 for a wrap so shelled out the $4.50 for pretzels and hummus as there was no free snack offered to go with my Diet pop. My flight from HNL-YVR was cancelled. I had checked in online already but when I got to the airport (2 hours before take off) I noticed the lines at the ticket booths were not moving at all and there was an already overall miserable feeling mulling about between the guests. I overheard someone say the flight was cancelled. I never even received a notification regarding this fact until it was close to boarding time. There were already guests checked through bags checked and they were told to come back through security to the ticket booths so they could be assigned a hotel to stay at overnight. Our aircraft never showed up due to "mechanical problems". It wouldn't be departing until the following day at 1.30pm. All connecting flights in Vancouver to my final destination (Winnipeg) would've already been long gone so I would've been stuck with an overnight in Vancouver the following night. I was flying alone however the rest of my family was on a WestJet flight scheduled to leave 15 minutes after my flight was supposed to take off. I asked the lady at the ticket counter what my options were and if she'd be able to help get on the WestJet flight instead. She kept blowing me off telling me there was nothing she could do nor did she seem like she was willing to help me in anyway. The lady at the Westjet counter immediately took all information and got me on the flight with no problems. Needless to say Air Canada Rouge definitely disappointed me big time. No wonder the flight was ridiculously cheap!

Took a flight from Toronto to Las Vegas yesterday. Scheduled departure was 8.40 am. At 9.00 they announced they were a bit behind and a plane was being towed to the gate. 45 minutes later still no plane and an announcement we're delayed to 10.30. At 10.30 an announcement they're still waiting on an aircraft and we can present our boarding pass to a few restaurants in the terminal for up to $10 worth of food and drinks. At 11.30 a plane arrives and we get boarded by 12. At which point they announce that the pilot and co-pilot have logged too many hours and we are waiting on a new crew. The new pilot arrives by 12.30 and tells us our plane was delayed because it had to be tested after getting overnight maintenance. She announces the co-pilot will be there soon. At 1.00 they announce that they need to reboot the computer system and we will be leaving shortly thereafter. By 1.30 the co-pilot and everyone seem accounted for but wait! We now have used so much fuel we need refuelling. We finally got underway at nearly 2.15 after waiting to refuel. This airline is a complete joke. As a Canadian I am embarrassed that they call themselves our national airline. All of these delays occurred after being forced to wait in Pearsons 'cattle pen' lounge for getting into Customs. We finally left at the same time we were scheduled to land. Numerous people on board missed connecting flights but the crew didn't seem to care. As an aside the crew seem very young and inexperienced and not well trained in how to handle these extreme flight delays with customers. If I could assign zero stars I would. The whole process was beyond frustrating I will always choose to fly via other airports and carriers when not forced to take Air Canada for work.

AC 1808 YYZ-SXM Jan 31 2015. AC 1809 SXM-YYZ Feb 21 2015. Having read all the reviews was prepared for the worst. And it was worse than the worst! Yes we were one of those that paid for pods from YYZ to SXM a year in advance only to be rouged. But the lack of any refund for business class airfare difference was moot compared to the horrific service. I felt like I was in an airplane where children were playing flight attendants. Sloppy attire stroppy attitude no respect  ridiculous service. Lets not even talk about the antiquated offerings on the iPad. I like Air Canada proper but when booking future flights will avoid the "red check mark" indicating a flight operated by rouge. West Jet you have earned new clients for our yearly trips to Anguilla via SXM!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We recently flew from Honolulu to Vancouver on the red eye - not because we chose a red-eye but unless we flew to Alberta we did not have a choice! This was easily the worst flight my husband and I have been on. The same issues noted on previous reviews existed - cramped seats old shows/movies minimal cabin service inconsistent temperature aisle space must only barely meet standards reading lights not working (quote from an attendant "working reading lights are not an airline safety requirement" which was the response I got when I finally tracked down 2 attendants who initially both said they would check out why the lights weren't working or get me a mobile reading light and who never got back to me). We have decided to use our remaining Aeroplan miles on non- Air Rouge flights and then book with Westjet or US airlines for future trips. In addition to our recent negative experience another consideration to drop Air Canada was an Air Canada employee on a previous interaction said that no one likes Air Rouge but do not expect Air Canada to make any changes. Why would one stay with an airline who doesn't value their economy customers. AC would have to make some significant improvements to show that they actually care about customers to have me even consider flying with them in the future!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew yesterday on Air Canada Rouge and expected only the worst from the angry reviews I've read. I've heard there was little to no leg room a terrible in-flight entertainment system and even worse customer service/delays. But none of these appeared to be true on my flight. First of all you can pay a little more for extra leg room and by doing so you get more room than you would on the main line. People may complain paying extra is ridiculous but if they're that concerned about not having enough room it's probably worth it. For the in-flight entertainment it was pretty weak. There are no longer TVs on the back of every seat like there are on the main airline. You can access it on your laptop tablets and phones but the content is limited and outdated. What I did and what I recommend doing is renting movies on your laptop or tablet or whatever prior to the flight so you can watch those without hassle. In regards to the delays I flew on Air Canada Rouge both ways and I didn't experience any delays either way. In fact I found they were quicker than the main airline. The one thing I do mind about the new charter airline is the in-flight entertainment. Oh well I guess it's the way of the future.

I'm sitting at the airport waiting for rouge 1849 to leave. It was supposed to leave at 6.20 its now 7.15 and everybody is milling around the Rouge desk waiting to see what will happen. Typical AC.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I had no idea what Air Canada Rouge was until after I had booked. We found a good deal online from YVR to HON for spring break so booked. Flight was on time leaving YVR and aircraft seemed clean and tidy but seats were a bit cramped in terms of leg room and elbow room. The flight attendants were all very friendly and bubbly as one would expect from new grads - I liked the attempt to look trendy with the uniforms. What was disappointing though for my two young children was that there was no in-flight entertainment. It would have been helpful to know that one needed the iPad app ahead of time. Also disappointing the lack of good available - you would think Mac and cheese would be the obvious to stock up on this flight. What was extremely disappointing was to find out the day of checkout was that our 10.15pm flight had been delayed by 4 hours. What was even more aggravating was to find out through 3 further emails that our flight was delayed even more. The final straw that broke the camel's back was to check in and then find out that our flight would be delayed 7.45 hours. So here I am sitting in Honolulu airport writing this in frustration at 4am because I can't sleep and have two exhausted children on hand. Had we known this earlier we would have just booked a hotel room. What I find insulting is the airline's idea of compensation for this is $10 meal vouchers - what a slap in the face. On top I find it ironic that the airline is 7.45hours delayed which is just under 8 hours on their website for which they would provide accommodations for. I'm sitting here in the airport probably with 100+ passengers looking as exhausted and frustrated as I am and probably thinking the same thing - never again. As I peruse the Internet wish I found this website earlier as I hear this is not the first time this has happened.

Flight to Tampa from Toronto return in mid-February: 2 adults in "premium rouge" 6 adults (one over age 80) and 6 children in economy. Attendant in Premium was pleasant and helpful food okay but seats very uncomfortable. Economy was hot and stuffy attendant was surly ran out of food to purchase had to pay $60 for iPads for the children. Definitely not recommended for family travel.

I just returned from Honolulu through Vancouver to Calgary. The flight from Vancouver to Honolulu was okay. It was on time and I brought my iPad and had the app downloaded so I could connect to the entertainment system. Although the movie selection and TV selections were pretty old. I'm talking '80s '90s old and those are the ones outside "vintage" selections. Thankfully I found a couple of things to watch. The inflight crew were pretty good to Honolulu and the plane seemed clean. I was in the economy cabin on the way to Honolulu but decided to upgrade to Premium on the way back because I hate late night flights. Thank goodness I did. The return flight from Honolulu to Vancouver was delayed by four+ hours so at least I could go in the United lounge for a few hours. We left Honolulu at 2.30 am so there went my connection to Calgary. The crew in Premium were pleasant but young and inexperienced. One flight attendant was talking at full volume to her co-worker behind the curtain. A) It's the middle of the night and she should be quiet so people can sleep. B) There are things your customers shouldn't hear. Our compensation for the delay was food vouchers (hilarious because the Honolulu airport pretty much closes up after 9 pm - thankfully United's lounge stayed open late for those of us in Premium). The other compensation was a discount code for our next AC flight. Thankfully Air Canada rebooked me in Vancouver for my flight home to Calgary (although the agent made it seem like that was a big deal for them to do) and I wasn't too out of sorts. But from other comments it looks like the Honolulu flight out of Vancouver is delayed regularly. No more Rouge for me unless there are no other options.

I flew AC Rouge Feb 21st to Phoenix and return. We were 1.5 hours late taking off. They said it was because they were waiting for people to get through customs but why should we reward people for being late and punish the people who left on time to get through customs. Rouge's website states you only need to be there 90 minutes before your flight this is wrong you need to be there at least 2-2.5 hours before to get through customs. Arriving late in Phoenix they had us waiting at the wrong carrousel for our luggage and never did tell us. Onboard entertainment is non existent you have to bring your own. The TV and movies on the Rouge app are so old you cannot find anything to watch. On return flight we were 30 min late leaving. Arrival back in Toronto we waited for over 1 hour to get our luggage. I will say that there is one thing they do well. Their booking online their online reminders and online booking for your meals - (just remember you have to show the flight attendant your ticket that you have prepaid for your meal.

We left Calgary on a Rouge flight to Vegas. It was a launch of the new Rouge "service" but it was anything but! There was not enough space to open my book so that I could partake in the only source of entertainment available to me on the flight. I could not download the Air Canada app in time to use my iPad and to rent one would be $10. Paying for all checked luggage coupled with no space entertainment or snacks made for the worst flight of my life!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew Air Canada Rouge on a red eye from Honolulu to Vancouver on December 15th. We had booked the flight on Air Canada and were moved to Rouge without consultation. I have always maintained that while the staff on the ground were neither helpful nor happy the staff on the planes were brilliant. This was not true of Rouge. It was reminiscent of flying Ryanair but more expensive. The seats were unbelievable narrow with next to no leg room and I'm only 5'2. The elbow rests were small as well. The lights on each side of the aircraft were not turned off even though it was a red eye. We asked the staff who told us that the lights had to remain on as a safely concern because the reading lights weren't working. We weren't able to get a logical explanation as it seemed absurd that the reading lights would have anything to do with safety. At about 1 am the seatbelt light was turned on and an announcement was made to do up our seatbelts. The staff than walked down waking every covered up customer up to ensure their seatbelts were fastened. While I appreciate the safety factor I question the need to wake up every customer in the middle of the night. They offered water once during the flight. No other drinks were offered unless you wanted to pay. They also came around and offered food for pay; no snacks were offered. We're not sure what they did with all their time. We had spoken to an attendant on a previous flight who advised us that none of the existing crew members had been transferred to the Rouge line and that they were paid less. It showed in every aspect of this flight. We have been flying AC for years despite our but our ongoing problems getting off the ground because we maintained that once in the air Air Canada was excellent. This is not longer true. Our relationship ended on this flight. We will not be flying Air Canada again.

I flew Air Canada Rouge and was appalled at how cramped the seats are. They are narrow and so close to the seat in front I don't know how a tall person could even fit their legs in. Or travel for longer than the 3 hours I did. Not comfortable. The flight attendants were very friendly and competent.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I was legitimately quite concerned flying AC-Rouge from OGG-YVR on an overnight flight this past February. Reviews of dirty planes incompetence and no seat room had me lamenting my end of my vacation (more so) than usual. I am 6"4 most planes have a lack of room for someone of my height. I had built Rouge to be this awful thing after all it's transport how bad could it be. Honestly it wasn't horrid. Granted I had this flight through points I would be furious if it was purchased full fare for business. But as a leisure airline overnight where most passengers are sleeping it did the trick. I did not have a premium seat or exit row. Yes it was tight but I fit in there ok seems to be a theme most flights I'm on have little to no leg room this felt no worse. The entertainment system was moot as it was overnight. Cabin was quiet well served (yes those outfits are idiotic) and I think they know it too. But overall it was not the horrid experience I would have expected.

Toronto - Nassau Sept 23 2014 and Jan 14 2015. AC 1816. Nassau-Toronto Jan 28 2015 AC 1817. First point I'd like to make is that I'm a long-time dedicated Air Canada customer. I fly about once a month on business and 3-4 times a year on leisure. I'm 6'4" - Rouge simply doesn't work. Rouge has managed to reach a new low in comfort. I don't need a lot of extras when I travel just a minimum amount of comfort. Really just boils down to a decent seat and some reasonable legroom. Whenever I travel now I avoid Rouge. Sorry Air Canada you've lost a dedicated customer.

First time flying Toronto to Jamaica with Air Canada rouge and never again will I fly AC Rouge. I will be cancelling my Visa Aeroplan and start using Adventura. The seats were so uncomfortable I had to roll-up my husbands sweater and stuff it behind my lower back. Having to use tablets to view movies etc is a real pain. Trying to eat and view / hold your tablet is difficult. Plus the TV shows are old and movies are old as well. Low budget airline at no discounted cost.

We flew from Vancouver to LA on Rouge. I had no idea what AC Rouge was. I was not particularly looking for a cheap flight just a way to get to Quito Ecuador in a reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately we have to fly back to Vancouver the same way. I will spend 2 days getting to Quito the next time rather than fly Rouge again. The kids attending to the flight were polite but obvious "newbies". The seats were absolutely not acceptable for normal weighted/heighted people. I am not sure my seat even had padding in it at all (I weigh 128 pounds) and my husband's knees were pressed hard against the seat in front of him (he is 6 feet tall). I always feel a little nauseous when travelling and there was no dispenser for air at all. Some of the seats were not aligned so when you put your feet under the seat in front of you you are sitting at an angle. We then switched to Avianca in LA to San Salvador Avianca again to Quito and Tame to Cuenca. What a world of difference! Air Canada needs to look at Avianca and Tame to see how to run an airline and treat their passengers! We will go out of our way to not fly Air Canada Rouge again and we will be telling all of our travelling friends to steer clear of Rouge and Air Canada altogether if at all possible.

I had the misfortune of getting placed on Rouge one year ago on a flight from Toronto to Kingston Jamaica and again this year from Orlando to Toronto. I would simply confirm what most passengers have said in these reviews. Cramped odd entertainment system and all around sub par travelling experience. Reading the reviews made me feel fortunate that my flights were under 4 hours. I could not imagine doing a transatlantic or transpacific flight in one of these planes. I plan to be travelling far more in the next few years and this experience has sent me scrambling to explore West Jet Porter or US airlines.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have had consistently good service with them over the last 40 years I have flown with them (and I am not an employee!) AC Rouge is a leisure carrier and not a five star airline like Emirates. You get what you pay for. Granted AC seriously screwed up by replacing out some of their key regular services with Rouge without telling customers. Not cool. That being said this little airline is not bad. The crews while young are actually very pleasant and eager to please. The uniforms are smart and they seem proud to wear them (the hats are a nice touch too. The food was tasty and satisfying. Not super high class but nice to get something that didn't make you gag. The service was attentive and I appreciated the new premium seating in the 767's. My airplane was clean (even after a quick turnaround after a 6 hour weather delay). My only wish is that they had service like Sunwing where everyone got a meal and there was inflight entertainment (even on the screens overhead) for all. Personally this airline is ok to fly for flights that are under 6 hours. Given the limited legroom do spend the money and fly the other classes. They give you more room and more attention. Overall I was nervous flying them after the horrendous reviews but in the end I really had a nice flight.

Flew Rouge Toronto to Phoenix 2 days ago. Knew it would be tight but they could put more padding on their seats. After a 5hour flight back was extremely sore. Agree with others the flight attendants appear to have little to no experience. Purchased a business class meal in economy and it took them over 2 hr to collect the tray and plates. My husband had no room on his fold down tray. And when we asked for it to he taken attendant refused. To top everything off because things were so tight we accidentally left our passport holder on the plane and didn't realize until next day. Fortunately got passports back but money was stolen. So try to speak to someone to report the theft and AC states they have no one on the ground in Phoenix as they have a third party. But they don't even have contact numbers to report the theft. Next time will fly either WestJet or Prter with JetBlue.

I have been flying with Air Canada for many years mostly southern destinations. My last flight last week was with Rouge. Small cramped and dirty. Cabin crew in cheap looking uniforms but service was adequate. My major beef is the seating. After 4.5 hours my legs hurt and my back ached. Is this the best Air Canada can do I hope not. Will look into other carriers that are willing to give me my moneys worth it will never be Rouge again.

Flew between Toronto and Samana Dominican Republic - Feb 7-14/15. Yes the seats are extremely cramped and the armrest between my partner and I wouldn't stay up (to allow us a bit of extra room). Heaven forbid the person in front of you reclines. The least they could do is give you a free sandwich on flights over 3.5 hours. Brought my own iPad with ACRouge app downloaded but the content was severely lacking (old old TV shows and movies). But the service was attentive and friendly (both at check-in and on-board) and the flight was on time both ways. Could have been worse.

Toronto to Santa Clara Cuba Feb 20 back Feb 27 2015. Airbus 319. Same trip last year but in B767. That was comfortable compared to this. Okay its the discount airline division of Air Canada. But its still 'Air Canada". On time for both flights. We take our seats in Toronto (BC16) and the folding tray I use is down on the left side. I have to use my arm to stop things from sliding off. Leg room is at its limits. I'm a small guy. No entertainment unless you rent it or carry your own on with you. I listen to audio books I'm good to go. Return trip (AB27) Where did the leg room go. I must have got rid of that tension and gained height or leg length. Sitting squarely in my seat (window) and my knees were at the seat in front of me. The guy in front of me was getting in his seat and the backrest side against the bulkhead looked like it was going to twist off and break from the seat. Each time he moved in his seat which was a lot because he also was uncomfortable. I was getting kicked in the knee with the aluminium crossbar from his seat. From my chest to his seat back was 13-14 inches. Doing some reading from the en-route Magazine and the fleet seating setup. Not quite the vacation memory I would have liked to have had this year Air Canada. My luggage didn't fly home to BC with me to top it all off.

Have flown Air Canada Rouge twice both times Vancouver to Las Vegas. First time we got an email telling us about IPAD Wifi based entertainment system - download the App and make sure your IPAD is charged. I prefer this entertainment system to the low res pound the seat back screens on AC. Better picture and sound. Most times I won't watch a good movie on AC because I would rather watch it at home on my big screen but I don't mind watching on my IPAD. The seats are merely OK but not instruments of torture like some people maintain. Read the in flight magazine to compare the AC vs ACRouge layout and you will see how many more seats they have jammed in. I can understand people being ticked paying Biz class for Premium Rouge as there is no comparison. Both trips YVR- LAS were on time. Staff are young and can be a little snippy but consider how many people they have jammed into the aircraft. I am not complaining as I got great value Whitehorse to Las Vegas - $212.00 all in and LV to Van for $175.00. I am 63 years old 5"10" 170 lbs and I had no trouble walking etc after the flights.

We flew Rouge on Dec 31st to Honolulu and were not impressed. We had originally booked this flight with Air Canada and to our surprise it was changed to Rouge. We thought okay we'll give them a try. The flight crew was very inexperienced which was understandable but they didn't even seem to try to make the passengers feel comfortable. Once we were in the air and they passed through the cabin once we didn't see them again until just before landing. They were slow in loading in the plane in Vancouver and in Honolulu they didn't seem to have clue as to what they were doing. The service on the return trip was even worse than the flight over. I saw several comments about how cold the plane were and how uncomfortable the seats were. We had the premium economy which were the seats with extra leg room and really not much of a bargain but much better than what economy looked like. In the future I'll look for something else than Rouge. I think this is bad idea from Air Canada. WestJet crams their passengers in the seats but at least comes by to see how their doing. Rouge doesn't have the low cost model with the caring attitude.

Flew Air Canada Rouge Toronto to Cancun 4 hour flight that's about all you can take sitting in that little seat the seats are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced if the seat in front of you reclines it feels even worse. The seats are small no inflight entertainment if want you can rent an Ipad which is pre loaded with movies the plane we were on was dated and old. One wash room was out of order. Drinks of water and pop served once during flight. Flight attendants are not very friendly you feel like your bothering them if your asking for a drink of water. Cash call for the airline and no consideration for the people who can only afford economy class tickets. I will never fly Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked our Jan 2015 family vacation flight with rouge YYZ to MCO. First time on rouge and yes the economy seat was tight for me 6' fine for my shorter wife and young son although tolerable for me for this short of a flight anything longer than 3 hours would be uncomfortable. But I knew all this before our flight A/C tells you the seat pitch and everything else such as inflight entertainment on their web page and through emails multiple times. So it was exactly what I expected and paid for inexpensive basic transport to Orlando FL. Flights were on time both ways service personal were friendly and competent aircraft was clean food/drinks were fine. Will fly again if fairs remain inexpensive.

We were originally going to book our vacation package (6 adults 4 kids) through WestJet because Air Canada Vacations did not have a package to the Marina El Cid. The travel agent offered us the option to book our flights with Air Canada then book transfer and hotel separately. We were very happy to choose that option since Air Canada was recommended as "the best". On Feb 18th we flew to Cancun on Air Canada Rouge and will never fly Rouge again. We had a 4.5 hr delay due to mechanical issues. We arrived at the airport at 5.30 am for our 8.30 flight. Between 6.43 am and 7.42 am the departure time changed 4 times. (11.00 12.00 13.30 and finally 13.00). We rec'd a $10.00 food voucher per person which we all know does not get you much in an airport. A sandwich and a drink was min $12.00. Not long after take off my sister in law went to the bathroom and came back to report that it smelt. The inflight entertainment system is a joke. The leg room is so cramped. We did receive a promo code for a discount on a future booking no idea how much of a discount but will probably never use it as it seems that all flights to sun destinations are with Rouge so disappointing. Hopefully when we are ready to book our Feb 2016 family vacation (10-12 people) Rouge will be gone and Air Canada Vacations will be a contender again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Recently returned from Honolulu to Toronto. Never heard of Rouge before and never want to hear of it again. You would think on an 8.5+ hour international flight that entertainment and meals would be a given without having to purchase. We were not aware there wouldn't be food. We are not big people but have never been so uncomfortable on a flight. Seats were far too close and didn't seem to have any padding. Plane also appeared quite dirty. The staff were neither friendly or unfriendly just seemed to be doing a job (probably hoping they would soon be transferred to the better planes! ).

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Worst Airline I have flown! Flew AC1854 from Las Vegas to Toronto to connect with AC868 to London. Incoming arrived late into LAS. Incompetent gate staff could not facilitate a quick turnaround so late departure. Late arrival at Toronto and then a frozen cabin door meant that we missed out connecting flight to London. Had to wait 10 hours for next flight. On flight there was No inboard entertainment no food cabin crew barely out of school. What a farce! This was booked as a United Airlines flight. Won't make that mistake again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Quite simply the worst "business class" cabin I have ever had the misfortune of traveling in. Premium" class seats on Air Canada Rouge are the exact same size as economy class seats. Flight was one hour late and not properly groomed in between flights. Lots of garbage left on plane. Also heard a couple of elderly people complain at the gate that no pre-boarding was being offered. Once airborne service was non-existent. No meal offered on a 5 hour international flight? Again this is supposed to be "premium" class. No blankets. Cabin was freezing. No seat back entertainment iPads were offered that were glitchy and the flight attendant seemed annoyed when I asked for ear buds. I could go on and on. Just a total disaster every step of the way. Air Canada is my airline of choice but avoid Rouge at all costs. I usually only give reviews to companies when it's something positive and the service was remarkable. But Rouge is just remarkably bad. One star.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Seven hour delay and had to camp out in Maui airport that had no services. Filthy aircraft interior small cramped seats only food was what was left on the plane (sushi for breakfast) from the previous trip from Vancouver. Young inexperienced flight attendants inadequate in air entertainment with old movies and TV series no one has ever heard of if you didn't have an iPad and wanted to rent one there aren't enough for the plane no duty free on international flight. Hard to believe that Rouge was created to compete with the likes of Westjet and they missed the mark big time. All the captive popular destinations will be populated with Rouge so the service we are all used to with Air Canada will be gone. I find it hard to believe I'd say that I'd rather fly United now but it looks that way.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew home from Los Angeles to Vancouver yesterday and unfortunately had to fly with Air Canada rouge. This was the worst flight I have experienced! There were only three flight attendants for the entire Airbus and no one was over 24 years old! Talk about inexperience! Only one attendant was serving beverages to the economy section and it took a painful two hours to complete! The seats were very uncomfortable and we were unable to get our knees straight in front of us. The back of the seats had no support which made for the most uncomfortable three hour flight! Never again will we use the services of Air Canada.

AC1224 Jan 26 2015 Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Return: Feb 6th 2015 AC 939. Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. Air Canada cater to the handicap. Helping them in and out of their airline seat we had priority seating throughout. Departure and arrival the porters were wonderful taking you right to the exit making sure you got into handicap taxi. The food onboard was nice hot when came to seat. Staff were patient.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Second time flying Rouge. Air Canada should take their name off of this disaster of a discount carrier as it will kill their overall reputation. Our first trip was with our 2 year old to Florida. Flight was delayed 7 hours with no information as to why. When we got to Orlando we had to wait an addition 3 hours for our bags. This flight is to Cancun. Was supposed to leave at 10 am finally left at 7.30pm. Again no reasons given. Flight was packed and seats were cramped. I could go on and on about all the negatives but Rouge is a disaster. I have always liked Air Canada but Rouge has killed all the goodwill Air Canada had built up with me over the years.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I traveled from Toronto to Cancun 1/22/15 and returned 1/29/15 on Air Canada Rouge. After having read so many negative reviews I was prepared for a poor experience. Fortunately I had just the opposite. The plane was clean and the attendants were pleasant and professional. I was disappointed however with the collection of chewing gum left by previous passengers in an unreachable space between the floor and the window. Surely gum could be disposed of in a more sanitary way. Food was adequate and no more but I've had worse on regular flights. For a discount airline I received what I paid for and commend the staff for super attitude.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
When I first read all the terrible reviews for Air Canada Rouge I was very reluctant to travel with them. I couldn't believe how angry people were. So needless to say I expected the worst but I chose to make the best of it because my trip had already been booked. I had a fantastic trip! Comparable to any flight I've taken with AC or otherwise. The seating was a bit tight but comfortable enough (granted I am a shorter person). Limited storage space so best to bring a carry-on that you can fit under your seat. The food was delicious and the best price for airplane food I've seen. A large glass of wine a sandwich and a snack for 13.50. The movie selection had plenty to choose from and entertainment app was easy enough to use. Flight arrival was on time both ways. Staff were very nice and helpful. So I may be alone in this but I would definitely fly Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Why would Air Canada put Rouge planes on flights to Phoenix and San Diego when they have almost a monopoly of these flights and always full. Just to give less service. Had booked premium rouge and pre-chose seats. On return they switched my seats so my wife and I were now not together. This is taking care of customers. Avoid Rouge whenever it's possible. I will now fly Alitalia to Italy if AC keeps these old planes on the route.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Vancouver/Honolulu and back on A/C Rouge Jan/Feb 2015. First thing I noticed after boarding was how dirty the aircraft was looked like it wasn't groomed in weeks. Seats were cramped very little cushioning cabin was extremely cold during flight didn't provide blankets or pillows. Will never fly Rouge again I'll spend the extra $$$ and fly with a real airline next time I head to Hawaii.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We were booked home in January 2015 on an Air Canada Rouge flight and charged full points by Aeroplan as per the normal Business Class on Air Canada flights. I do not know how Air Canada can pass off this "Business Class" on their Rouge flight as equal to their normal Business Class accommodation which they offer. Clearly I questioned the Aeroplan representative when told we would fly home on Rouge and was told it is the same as regular Air Canada Business Class although not the pods but with adequate comfort and leg room. To say that the seating was inadequate would be an understatement. We have traveled Air Canada Business Class annually YVR to OGG and have never encountered such sub-standard cramped seating with minimal leg room. My husband and I are tall people this being one of the reasons we choose Business or Executive Class. I was barely able to walk when we finally landed in Vancouver. This type of accommodation can cause a health issue for many people. You charge for Executive Class and provide less than adequate Economy seating. Since 2004 we have travelled to Maui annually and paid the extra Aeroplan points for the comfort of the Business Class. In our estimation we got less than Economy. Most of the Canadians whom we encountered on Maui who had flown Air Canada Rouge Business Class were horrified and the reports we received were of great concern to us. Even though we had been privy to these negative comments we felt that being Air Canada it could not be that unsatisfactory. Therefore based on past experience we embarked upon this flight with open minds. We were quite incorrect it was far worse than anything we could have imagined. This is gross misrepresentation on the part of Aeroplan and Air Canada. If Rouge is the only flight Air Canada is offering between Vancouver and the Hawaiian islands then we will be seeking flights with other airlines in the future. At best it was "Cattle Class" accommodation. I can only imagine the cramped conditions for the people in Economy.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
What an embarrassment for Air Canada. I have spent the last 3 or 4 years defending the "new" Air Canada for the quality and safety of travel with them (you know the drill about their "award winning" status). After my family's Rouge experience I am back at square 0. Let me count off the ways Rouge made us see red on our recent trip to Hawaii: 1) highly punishing and inefficient boarding process both in Vancouver and in Honolulu 2) primitive entertainment services 3) a 1980s vintage and obsolete B-767 where essential functions like lighting to read by didn't work 4) hours of discomfort in seats that hinted at promiscuity (that's how close they are to each other front to back and side to side) 5) a Rouge crew that was decidedly green (we figure that this must be a training ground for new Air Canada staff and the perky uniform is decidedly weird). So my family's take is: avoid AC Rouge and go WestJet or take a US carrier even if it costs more.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We got rouged too. What a terrible airline. First off no in-flight entertainment. Unless you knew that prior and downloaded the AirCanadaRouge App to your iPad. If you have $10 you can rent an iPad? The only entertainment you get is watching other passengers painfully adjust in their seats. Even less legroom than any other plane! Are you hot? Well there aren't any personal air vents. Hope you ate before you got on board or brought your own snack because you won't be getting a crumb from this airline. Maybe they should have saved money by not buying fedoras for the airline crew. Oh and all the airline attendants look like 19 yr old kids.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Air Canada Rouge from Montreal to Orlando and then Orlando back to Toronto. The staff were young but very professional and friendly. Very impressed. The complementary drinks were as excepted and I hate airplane food so I was very happy no one included myself was buying any. Both flights I was able to get preferred economy seats at no charge (once at airline kiosk and once at the gate) Had exit row seats both flights and i have never had so much leg room and recline in economy. It is worth paying extra for preferred economy because the back of the plane looked like a sardine jar! Overall extremely satisfied! My only complaint is that you can watch entertainment with the android app which is so stupid as far more people have android than apple!

Feb 14 Vancouver to Honolulu flight 7 hours delayed. This flight has run late most days over the past 2 months. Service on board poor - traveller requesting full can of Coke was denied and got a lecture from attendant that she still had several passengers to serve. Time to switch to Westjet.

Vancouver to Honolulu - The AC was "entire cabin" type (no small control like regular planes) and we had to keep our coats on for the full trip both ways because of cold drafts. The Flight Attendants quietly agreed.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew Air Canada Rouge for the first time last week (YYZ to Honolulu) - it was the worst flight I have ever taken and I fly frequently. The seats were extremely small/cramped and at 6'1 I had nowhere near enough room. I was surprised how many seats they crammed onto an old 767. The staff were not very helpful or courteous and with no seatback display system we had to use our own device to access entertainment via wifi. Most of the people seated around me didn't realize that you needed to download the Air Canada Rouge app beforehand and they were out of luck (or had to rent one of their tablets). I was able to use my phone to connect but there was no wifi access for the first hour of the flight and it was intermittent at best afterwards with frequent dropouts and long waits for reconnections. The tablet concept does not work. I am disappointed that AC has transitioned/downgraded many of their holiday destinations to Rouge service and will be looking to alternatives i.e. West jet. I will never fly AC Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew from Vancouver to Maui and back. We booked on points and quite frankly I had no idea what Rouge was before we even boarded the plane. Biggest complaint was about lack of in-flight entertainment. As a parent with two younger kids in-flight movies are a lifesaver. I was floored to see that missing. Did we have other options - yes. We had our own ipad books etc. What was galling was to be told "you can access movies from your ipad but only if you have the app downloaded first". Of course that is useless advice once in the air so guess what? We have iPads for rent for $10. It's the nickel-and-diming on every last thing possible that drives me nuts. The plane was huge and full and yes seats are cramped. I am 5'8 and did okay my husband though at 6'4 it was an agonizing trip particularly the red-eye on the way back. Finally the crew. They all looked very young and the inexperience showed. A young Dad wasn't seated with his wife infant and toddler and was told to "ask around to see if someone will switch". He said "I was told you would help me with that" to which the response was "there will be lots of people who'll want to switch if you ask around. Not sure if she ever did lend assistance. There are other nitpicky things (flight was more than an hour late leaving Maui) etc. Nothing was disastrous but all the little annoyances add up. I am officially done. To be charged for every little thing plus have poor service and the prices aren't even that much better? No thanks I'm out!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Terrible aircraft equipment track record. Both my flight from Honolulu to Vancouver went mechanical and eventually cancelled after 7 hours of indecisiveness from the Air Rouge crew and now last night from Vancouver to Honolulu we took off and had to turn back around because of mechanical problems again and the flight was cancelled. The "Premium rouge" seats are Business class prices but no way Business class seats. What a downgrade from Air Canada's lay flat Business class seats. I am contemplating flying economy on Westjet.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have travelled with Air Canada in the past and did not hesitate to book a flight with Rouge thinking that it would be a similar experience. I was so wrong! I travelled from Toronto to Phoenix. While waiting at the gate the staff were so disorganized they were not able to board the passengers in a timely fashion. There were 5 boarding groups. They called the first second and third in rapid succession so there were very long lines that were taking very long time to process. Once on the plane there was not adequate space for my carry on. I was told I had to check it. Since I have medications in the bag that I cannot be without I refused to check the bag. The stewardess asked me to remove the medication from my bag and keep it in my purse or under my seat. It would have been embarrassing! In order to remedy this situation in the future perhaps Rouge should not allow people to place backpacks and smaller items that can fit under the seat in the overhead bins so more room would be available for carry on bags. Then place coats and jackets in the bins after the bags are in place. The plane was so full that I had to sit on my winter coat for the entire 4 hour flight as there was not even a space for my coat. Not too comfortable. I paid the same price or more than my last Air Canada flight Toronto to Phoenix so Rouge is not even offering a more economical flight. More than likely more profit for the airline less comfort for the passenger.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew on an early morning flight from YVR to LAX. As soon as I boarded the plane I was a little taken aback at how many seats there were (and I travel a lot and have seen a lot of aircraft). I sat in 51F which is right at the back of the plane (as in last row). It's a 3 seater row (with adjustable arm rests) so I had plenty of space to move around freely. However any other of the seating and it would be a very tight fit. I'm a larger guy so I tend to get the aisle seat but I found that the rest of the craft would've been very cramped for my size. Just enough leg room I'm 5"9 and I was barely touching the seat in front of me. Any taller and it would be painful.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Just flew on Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Cancun and back. I must admit after seeing these reviews I was a little nervous. But I thought I would give them a chance especially since it was our honeymoon. On the flight down we were coming from Thunder Bay to meet the connection in Toronto. When checking in in Thunder Bay we were told we would be getting our seats numbers when we get to the gate. I later realized that this was a fancy way of saying the plane was overbooked and we were chosen to be bumped. However we were able to get on the flight and my wife and I were able to sit together. On the flight down the staff were very cheery and in a good mood. After this first flight I thought I might be giving them a good review. The seats are a little cramped but it was not too bad for four hours. The way back was pretty bad. So when we check-in in Cancun the agent said that the plane was overbooked and asking us if we would volunteer to spend the night. My wife and I both had commitments back home so we said no. So they gave us our tickets and once again told us we would get our seat numbers at the gate. Translation: If people show up you are still getting bumped. We both got on the flight but were unable to even sit anywhere close to each other. We asked if could be switched but we were told no. Ironically the lady was beside was by herself too so they were just too lazy to figure it out. The staff on the way back seemed very miserable. My wife told me she had to flag down someone to order food even though she had her credit card out ready to pay. And they didn't even give her a declaration card. Thankfully in Canada you can fill one out for the entire family. While I admit that the entertainment system is very innovative it did crash from time to time. So make sure you have some back up entertainment on your devices. The fact that we were almost bumped on our honeymoon is very discouraging. I would say stick to WestJet Sunwing or Air Transat. I can't wait until Porter starts doing tropical destinations. However I would not recommend Rouge unless you are prepared to be bumped and you don't mind the cramped space.

I've had concerns with AC's quality for some years but a recent flight to Phoenix on AC Rouge finally sealed its fate as far as I am concerned. I am 6'4" tall 280 pounds. How I got into the seat I will never know. The poor person in front of me had my knees in their back and simply wasn't able to recline their seat. I'm used to AC staff being frumpy with a 'can't be bothered' attitude but this flight hit a new low. Rude abrupt ignoring requests dealing sandwiches like cards from a deck I could go on. The final humiliation was that after a 4.5 hour flight my legs were totally numb (as was my rear). It took three passengers and an AC staff member to heave me out of the seat and support me while the circulation returned. I changed to another airline for the return flight. I will never fly AC again. I will pay extra for another airline take a stop over change my route but never again AC. I am ashamed to be Canadian with you as the national airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I find Air Canada Rouge airplanes from Toronto-Phoenix and return to be very cramped. As well the entertainment system is in my opinion very poor. The selection for those who have their own iPad is less than for those who rent an Air Canada Rouge iPad. I really wish that there was an option to fly this route at least once a week with the main airline Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
It's Canada's answer to Europe's Ryanair. They're making a few extra bucks by cramming more very uncomfortable seats onto an Airbus 319. The "entertainment" streaming which replaces the usual video screens is a joke unless you enjoy watching endless commercials and the lamest movies on the market. My biggest problem is that Air Canada on certain routes no longer gives you a choice between a regular flight and "budget" Rouge. Fortunately we were flying Vancouver to Palm Springs ( only 2.5 - 3 hours). Pity the fools who are on long haul Rouge flights. I'd be tearing my hair out! The high school kids who were pretending to be flight attendants were enthusiastic and doing their best but as mentioned in another comment are they prepared for an emergency situation.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew YYZ to Phoenix (5 hour flight) and I was in constant pain from the seats. While waiting for bags at the destination (which took 90 minutes) most of the passengers we talked to said the same thing - never again Rouge. Air Canada has embarked on a strange experiment to find out how much people will pay to avoid extreme inconvenience and physical distress.

Toronto to Phoenix Dec 13th 2014 AC1849. Phoenix to Toronto Jan 10th 2015 AC1848. There is simply no leg room in economy for an average height adult. It was incredibly uncomfortable for the duration of the flight. Will have to find an alternative airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
This is one of the worst airlines that I have flown. Maybe they should spend as much time taking courses in courtesy as they do on those ridiculous outfits. I boarded the plane and had to put my ticket into my pocket because I had a full hot coffee in my one hand and a very heavy fragile bag in the other hand. Upon entering the plane I already knew my seat number in my head. The attendant demanded to know what seat I was in. I told her and kept moving. She then got belligerent with me and demanded to see my ticket. I told her that I don't have a third hand and my ticket was put away. She jumped in front of me to keep me from walking forward and demanded yet again to see my ticket. I have flown this airline maybe 5-6 times now and all of their flight attendants are rude. The physical plane was fine the flying was fine the snacks were fine but the attendants - not fine.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew 3 times with AC Rouge in 2014. Twice to the Dominican Republic and once to Rome from Montreal. Not a very good experience very tight seating no entertainment and the plane to Rome was an old Boeing 767 that needed overhauling. Service was mediocre and their outfits looked ridicules. From now on I will try to avoid AC Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada rouge is the worst airline I have ever flown. Not only have they crammed in extra rows of seats ensuring the most cramped flight experience they still let the seats recline which puts the seat in front of you in your face. I did not have a choice in airlines as I redeemed aeroplan miles and spent the same amount as if I had flown on AC but got stuck on rouge. The fact that Air Canada is switching sun and fun destinations to Rouge has made the decision to switch to Westjet an easy one. At least the loyalty miles (Westjet dollars) will actually get me on a Westjet plane!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Recently travelled AC Rouge to/from Cuba. This was a short flight of 3.5 hours. The seats were comfortable but not roomy. My husband and I left the arm rest between us in the upright position so did not feel as restricted. There is no on-board entertainment but I-Pads could be rented for $10.00. We had researched the airline and were aware of the lack of entertainment so we were prepare with our own - book cross stitch music crossword puzzles etc. The food provided (charged to your credit card) was fresh and tasty. The flight attendants were very young and needed a bit more experience in customer service. TIP - book your seat prior to flight and near the front section of the plane sometime run out of food choices by the time they get to the back part of the plane. Would not want to take AC Rouge on a much longer flight. There is not a lot of room between the seats and almost nil when the person in the seat in front of you reclines their seat.

I'm a frequent flyer with lifetime status and fly about 150k a year. This was my first and last rouge flight. Economy seating was terrible. There's absolutely no room. When comparing economy seating and space on rouge to other airlines other airlines' economy seating is huge. I thought sardines had it bad but then again the sardines are typically dead before being canned. I now know what a sardine feels like. I'll be taking another airline. To Air Canada bring back normal service!

My husband and I flew business class last week to Cancun from Toronto and return. We couldn't have asked for more attentive flight attendants good food and emphasis on detail. Was a little hesitant about flying Rouge for the first time after all the bad reviews but sometimes I think the passenger in the seat might be the problem. Congratulations to Air Canada for their creation of Rouge couldn't have asked for a better flight and flight crew.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have travelled AC Rouge a few times in Premium and this was my first in economy and have to say I truly do not like the AC Rouge concept at all. They have taken all the fun away from travelling on vacation and cheapened the Air Canada brand considerably. I am an elite status AC member and really struggling with continuing to give Air Canada any more of my business because of this. The service is mediocre at best and the whole ipad concept does not work. The movies are old and it is too awkward to deal with. Overall a truly unappealing experience.

If I had to fly Rouge Economy always I would quit travelling. I am a regular BC Client and on short notice had to fly Rouge. All they are doing with this service is making me fly other airlines. I am forced to fly Rouge Premium to Costa Rica Feb. 23rd and purposely choose American Airlines with a Layover in Miami of 3 hours for the trip home as I prefer their business class.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
On way to Orlando I got bumped to Premium rouge as a frequent flier. Unfortunately no Premium class provided. On the way back I flew in Economy class. Worst flight ever being cramped and bum hurt which never happens even during a 15 hour flight. People beside me also could not believe this bus class service. Flight Attendants nice but what cheesy outfits. Air Canada what happened to you! As a frequent flier they are giving me too many reasons not to be a loyal customer.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I had no idea what Air Canada 'Rouge' was until I experienced it on a trip from Toronto to Tampa on January 13 2015. Everything you read in the unflattering reviews is true. However to add insult to injury we had a full flight with no water in either of the washrooms! There was what appeared to be a well-worn sign in the washrooms apologizing for the lack of water and a supply of little individual towelettes to wipe your hands afterwards. On the trip back when the stewardess asked if I wanted a drink I asked first whether there was water in the washroom this time before deciding whether or not to drink anything. I will never travel Air Canada Rouge again. I will fly another airline for my next trip to Florida in a few months time just to avoid the inconvenience of no leg room (and I'm barely 5 foot tall) discomfort of thinly padded seats inability to get in and out of any seats but the aisle nothing to ease boredom - not even a used newspaper from a previous flight. By far the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Rouge does an injustice to Air Canada mainline. I am an AC frequent flyer and will look for alternate carriers if the only option is Rouge. Flight to Tampa on January 18th was a 18.50 departure and we got off the ground at 00.30 on the 19th. Trip home on the 23rd was delayed over 3 hours. Not sure what the issues were but weather was not one of them. I have no problem with one delay but two in a week makes me think that these folks have some issues. Seats also leave something to be desired and Rouge should be renamed Crampjet!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew to Dominican. I agree with all other reviews. Worst leg room ever. Expect lots of leg related health issues in the future because you truly cannot move your legs while inflight. I fly with AC frequently but will be looking at other options. I do not carry my IPAD with me nor do I wish to rent one for $10.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Firstly flight delayed 6 hours out of YYZ to LAS. Sure breakdowns happen. I was tracking the history of the aircraft online and it has been broken down and attempted to be put back into service 4 times in a week. I am 6 foot tall and the lack of leg room was not only insulting it is bordering on a health and safety issue. Air Canada Rouge would rather make the extra few bucks off cramming a few more seats on the plane than worry about whether passengers will be able to walk again after flying with them. I am so upset that I have cancelled my return flight with this airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Toronto to Tampa on January 6. Air Canada Rouge is the only AC option on this route. Flight attendants tried their hardest and were pleasant. Only two of them however so service was very slow. Seats are worst I have ever flown - no leg room hard and thin seat cushions. I'm 192 cm and my knees were stuck against the seat in front of me. Everything about the experience was cheap cheap cheap. Price was no different than regular AC service. I've been a regular and loyal AC customer for many many years. I would avoid AC Rouge and switch airlines if this is the only service AC would offer on the route I wanted. Trip satisfaction 4 out of 10 because we arrived safe and sound not because of the inflight experience!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I will never travel Air Canada Rouge again. If you are booking a cheap flight their service may be fine but when you book an all inclusive vacation with Air Canada and have to pay for baggage check-in food and entertainment it is not acceptable. The seats were uncomfortable for a 5 hour flight. $10 to rent an I-pad for entertainment. No in flight music or movie without the rental. Not everyone has an I-pad or takes it on their vacation. Pre- booking seats can only be done by calling Air Canada and waiting on line for 45 minutes or longer. I will never book another Vacation with Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
e flew from Vancouver to Kahului on Air Canada Rouge AC1827 and back on AC1828 a week ago. Alas this might be the last time we use this airline as it was the most uncomfortable seating and rudest crew. My back is still hurting after a week and we cancelled a trip to Hawaii that was coming up due to Air Canada Rouge. The crew was as usual arrogant and unprofessional. They decided to turn all the lights on half away through the red eye flight to distribute beverages while everyone was trying to sleep. As for the price there is no difference with mainstream Air Canada. You pay the same for a horrible experience.

Flew from Montreal to Rome on Sept/18/2014 and returned Oct/18/2014. This was the worst experience of my life. Never again. Air Canada should be ashamed you are so cramped in your seat that can hardly breathe.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
AC1831. Jan 10 2015. Absolutely awful. Paid for business class and got hostility class. Attendants terrible. Seating worse than economy on other flights. Will never fly AC again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew Air Canada thinking we'll be getting a basic level of comfort common to all Air Canada planes but what a mistake. Didn't know about Rouge. There's no leg room minimal service no comfort no space in the overhead since people bring large carry-ons to avoid paying for checked-in luggage. The almost 5 hr flight to Phoenix from Toronto was painfully boring with the in-flight entertainment consisting of online streaming of old movies and shows. We had to bear all this again on the flight back!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
AC1837 December 30 2014 Toronto to Phoenix Arizona. I normally enjoy flying Air Canada even tango is more preferred than other airlines. Air Canada Rouge is the least comfortable airline I've ever been on. I am 5'5" and if I didn't sit up perfectly straight my knees touched the back of the seat in front of me. My boyfriend who is 6"3' was quite a bit larger then the space that he was provided. The poor person in front of us had issues reclining because his knees were in her seat. Air Canada is great as long as there is no rouge tacked on at the end.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Have travelled several times between Toronto to Phoenix - always a good service. Went on Rouge the worst flight ever. Did not tell us we had to download an app to get inflight entertainment until 15 mins in the air so nothing to watch on the 5 hr flight. Packed in like cattle no leg room.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Return from Fort Lauderdale to Ottawa. As many have said cramped. Rouge is overpriced. Reminded me of cheap flights UK to Spain 25 years ago. Yet for what one gets Rouge is not a cheap option. But at least the crew got us there and with a soft landing.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Brutal seats. I am 6'4" and could barely get into the seat. The passenger in front of me insisted on reclining his seat back. The AC Rouge website states that the slimline seats provide more room and more comfort. My legs are still swollen from the flight. The only good thing about flight 1892 YYZ to Tampa on January 16 was the inflight cabin attendants. I will never fly Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Less leg room than usual no inflight entertainment no hot meal for an almost 6 hour flight (If you want something you have to purchase it off their very limited food cart) and limited space in their overhead compartments. My husband was asked to hold our carry-on bag on his lap during take-off because there was no room in the overhead compartments and the bag did not fit under our seat. The staff on flight 1786 were not at all accommodating. Both my husband and I are not complainers but the service you get with Air Canada Rouge is totally unacceptable. They give you nothing for your money.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
If you've spent any time reading on-line reviews of Rouge service and you're still considering booking a Rouge flight don't do it! I was Rouged once when the service was first introduced and vowed to never fly with them again. Unfortunately I made the mistake of consciously booking with Rouge while thinking that it couldn't still be as bad as my first experience - I was wrong! My YUL-LAS return flights over the past two weeks were a complete disaster in every possible way. I even earned a compensation reward (that will never be used!) for one of the flights. I fly a lot including regular transpacific flights (not with Air Canada!) and super discount flights on Chinese airlines. Nothing compares to the poor quality of service on Rouge. Rouge seats are terribly uncomfortable the flight attendants are clueless the planes are old and not well maintained (does anyone enjoy blocked overflowing toilets).

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew Air Canada for years because we knew we could depend on a pleasant experience and a comfortable ride - a far cry from your typical charter. On a recent trip to the Caribbean on AC rouge we were treated to incredibly uncomfortable and cramped seats a dingy and dirty interior a flaky electrical system (lights on lights off like magic if the lights worked at all) and an unreliable entertainment system (maybe you can watch a movie maybe we'll be having bandwidth allocation problems and you won't be able to). We brought our own devices for the entertainment system but there is no charging capability. How handy. And the light switches are on the arm rest so my neighbour's elbow was also quite efficient at turning it on and off unexpectedly. The flight was late both directions didn't seem to be weather related. Nobody made their connection on the way back forcing them to stay overnight. So no incentive to choose AC again that's for sure. We were always willing to pay a bit more in the past. Now we might as well go with any low-quality discount airline. Apparently they are all the same.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I don't think you could get any worst! I also was "rouged" as I took a flight from YUL-MCO. Being 6'4 I would rather get a root canal then have to sit on a rouge plane again. I am in disgust that Air Canada would create such a terrible product when their mainland carrier is great. I am an altitude member and fly often with AC and somehow have managed to avoid this airline for almost two years and will never take another rouge flight as long as I can help it. The entertainment selection was terrible not that I had enough room to watch it on my ipad as my legs where twisted in a pretzel trying to find a comfortable place for my legs. Never again!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YYC-LAS LAS-YYC. This itinerary was made tolerable by the fact I was able to upgrade both flights using aeroplan e credits. Very uncomfortable seats on the 319 to LAS and the so called Premium Rouge reminds me of Canadian early 90s on their 737 with the seat next to you not sold. Food was OK both flights but obviously cut rate from mainline J eg less linen. The 767 flight to YYZ was akin to narrow body J mainline in terms of seating. I am not sure what Air Canada was thinking with the IFE what are you supposed to do with that iPod while eating? And they were handed out far too late on the first flight. I did not get through the movie I was watching. If I had to wear a uniform like that to work I would not be doing so proudly! I will avoid Rouge if at all possible in the future.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Vancouver to Honolulu January 9-17 2015. To Honolulu AC1831 5.30 pm on time departure seats 12 D and E (Zone 5): 1) How the new boarding works at YVR airport - when they call out Zone 3 (back of the plane) you must wait about 10 minutes before boarding. My complaint is that none of the gate attendants called out Zone 5. It became a free for all where no one bothered to call out Zones 4-5. Having Prestige status and/or one of the Visa Infinite Privilege credit cards will not bump you into Zone 2 for priority boarding on rouge. 2) Our cabin and cabin seats were clean. My partner is 6'2 and I'm 5'4. We found the seat pitch (35) to be comfortable and the recline to be sufficient enough to enjoy a snooze. I brought my Android kobo reader and downloaded movies/TV shows beforehand and was happy with that. Yes they charge $10 per iPad rental but as stated in previous reviews the connections timeout and any Air Canada app show you watch will intermittently stop and take up to a few minutes to load and continue (as my partner experienced on his iPhone). 3) Flight attendants are attentive and aim to be very pleasant. 4) I ordered cheese cubes with crackers as a light snack from the OnBoard menu. We had visited the Priority lounge prior to for some light snacks. 5) Flight came in to HNL 25 minutes early. We waited 40 minutes for our luggage in the partial open-air airport which still looks the same as it did in the 80s as with most dated American airports. To Vancouver AC1830 01.00am departure (delayed from 11.15pm) seats 12 A and C (Zone 5): 1) If you are a Nexus card holder you get pre-TSA clearance at HNL airport which is handy for moving quickly. This open-air airport is not air-conditioned in the main corridors. Lounges are closed after 6pm. Check before you leave hotel to make sure flight is on time. 2) HNL gates are open only when the incoming flight has landed and completely deplaned. 3) Nothing past Zone 3 is called out. At YVR gate attendants admit that the system is new and they are still figuring out how it works (whether or not to bother calling out Zone 5 at all). 4) By the time we boarded we noticed that the plane was not full. Because the plane arrived late (weather reasons) although the signs said "delayed to 12.05am" we didn't take off until after 1am. However we arrived only 20 minutes later than we normally would had the plane left on time. 5) Both directions there are no means to control air and there are no power outlets to charge devices. HNL airport has plug-ins throughout to pre-power up however. 6) Cool air was blasting in our window/aisle seats and we felt it. When we were mid-cabin flying to HNL this wasn't a problem. I'd recommend purchasing a beach towel merely to cover up and keep warm on the plane. We were fully dressed for chillier Vancouver winter weather which helped. Would I fly it again? Yes booking seats 12 D and E or D and F. Why? Good price decent leg room served first with drinks/snacks - they offered twice and in a very timely manner. You de-plane faster. Overhead bulk storage is big enough for two single-day backpacks and more. We always had room for our stuff. The flight attendants were kind.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have been flying to Hawaii for over 30 years always Business class on Air Canada but Air Canada Rouge which is part of Air Canada has got to be the worst experience I have had. The equipment is old 767 aircraft. I confirm this with the flight attendant because the bathrooms were in really bad shape. The seats were new and hard and no longer flat beds. You can get spoiled when you pay for Air Canada business-class prices for economy experiences. The food was good but they ran out of my choice. Do not fly Air Canada rouge unless you need to use this airline. No TV on back of seats and bring your iPad.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew with Rouge from YUL to SAN last year and was disappointed after using my eUpgrades to find out I was in the front of he airplane which is no different from Economy class in Air Canada. The seats were nothing like business class the service was so so we got an IPad for inflight entertainment and it felt like a 'charter type' airline. I wasn't aware that my flight was with Rouge so I was very disappointed when I entered the airplane and realized I was on the discount flight and had used my upgrades for this. I go to San Diego a couple of times a year and I will probably fly with United from now on since Air Canada doesn't give us an option to use Rouge when connecting to Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew Air Canada Rouge for the first time the beginning of January. They should rename it Air Canada Sardine Can. I am only 5 foot 3 inches and my knees were hitting the seat in front of me. I dropped my glasses on the floor and there was no way I could get them and was told by the steward on the plane that there is nothing he could do that I would have to wait until the plane was empty and then I could try to reach and get them and then he said nothing else can be done and my reply was "fly another airline". Going into Cuba I had 3 forms to fill out and they gave them to us as we were starting to land and then told to put our trays up and we could not use the trays to fill out the forms. Very poor service and you are crammed in as I said like sardines.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Vancouver to Honolulu. Booked Air Canada in Feb 2014 got changed to Rouge. Worst flying experience ever. Flight to Honolulu was 1 hour late returning flight was over 3 hours late. Seats are uncomfortable with no legroom even in Premium class. We were charged the same prices as Air Canada nothing on Rouge is close to a regular Air Canada flight. We have flown many low cost carriers in Europe for 1/10 the cost with better service. Will never fly Rouge again it is awful. Inflight entertainment is a real laugh. My wife and I are regular Air Canada customers. I would rate trip satisfaction value for money and seat comfort 0 as other passengers have done.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Vancouver to Maui on Air Canada Rouge December 13 2014 - this was the worst flight. Seats were the most uncomfortable. For the cost of this flight I was expecting more for the money. I will not be flying with Air Canada any more for the simple fact that when the flights were booked back in August there was no mention of Rouge and there certainly was no discount for that portion of our flight. Time to go back to old system.. I do not recommend flying rouge if your flight is over 1 hour long or if you are over 5' 5" good luck trying to fit your knees in front of you in your seat. Goodbye Air Canada Rouge!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Traveled to Phoenix Dec 18th for two weeks holiday and booked Air Canada as usual. One week prior to departure rec'd an Air Rouge email - oh well had no idea what it was. Now I can inform you - it was awful - a throw back to Air Transat planes 20 to 25 years ago. The seats were so close you could not sit with your legs straight if you are tall and you could not cross your legs let alone your ankles. Once the person ahead put her seat back I could not move or would have hit my head on the back of her seat. There ought to be a law re safety -- none of us would have been able to move to get out in an emergency and what about health insuch cramped quarters. The correct spelling is not "Air Rouge" - it is "Air Ruse"! I will never take an Air Rouge flight again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Jan 16 2015 OGG-YVR. What kind of a system of 3 zones to load an aircraft? Simply ineffective annoying and takes extra time to load the aircraft. What were Air Canada thinking? Service was rated as zero just like a charter flight. No more Air Canada!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
On January 8 2015 I had the displeasure of being a passenger on Air Canada Rouge flight 1828 from Maui to Vancouver and prior to that Air Canada Rouge flight 1827 from Vancouver to Maui. I begin by comparing the regular Air Canada Boeing 767 to the Rouge Boeing 767. You will note from the seating chart that the regular Air Canada Boeing 767 has 39 rows with eight passengers per row. The Rouge aircraft has 49 rows. The additional ten rows undoubtedly speaks volumes to the uncomfortable seating mentioned by many. Like many of the previous commentators I have been a member of the Air Canada Altitude 50K group for years. In good faith I booked with Air Canada to discover my flight to be with Rouge. The Rouge seats are extremely uncomfortable and offer an average sized passenger little if any leg room. Your knees are crushed when the passenger in front moves their seat back. Comparatively the seats are similar to sitting on a wooden church pew for the duration of the flight. I will never again fly Rouge. From Edmonton there are a number of other options available.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Dec 15 2014 AC1828 and AC1876 Jan 9 2015. Terrible. Avoid at all costs. I travel quite frequently and am of reasonable height/weight. The seats are tiny and uncomfortable. Knees pressed against the seat ahead. Barely any lean back because you'd slam into the person behind you. Very small storage above. Inflight 'entertainment' didn't work. 5.5hrs to Maui. Paid top dollar. Lots of other people commented the same. Nice staff not the jaded older ones that can be found on regular AC flights.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YVR-LAX on 1/12. Can't complain about the service as the attendants were workmanlike. Seating as noted by most reviewers is awful. The in-flight Wi-Fi service did not work initially and when I finally corralled a flight attendant she laughed and told me that the crew had forgotten to turn it on. By the time they did turn it on we were third of the way through our 2.5 hr. flight. Would fly this airline again on short routes no more than 2 to 2 1/2 hours and only with an aisle or exit row seat. Otherwise caveat emptor.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
For a business class ticket price this was a waste of an upgraded price. The seats do not recline far enough to rest comfortable the inflight iPad usage is really not conducive to eating in flight and your posture is compromised while viewing a the iPad needs to sit on your tray table thus causing your neck to bend downwards. I watched as passengers tried to eat while positioning their iPad here or there. It was really bothersome. It was not a comfortable flight. We fly to Maui several times a year and this is not my preferred airline for sure - Air Canada Rouge is not what I would choose to fly. I was very disappointed overall.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Last August after returning to Toronto from San Diego on Air Canada Rouge I couldn't walk properly for a week. The seat space was so small I felt that I was being punished for the full five five hours of my trip. Since I'm just under six feet I wondered how the tall people were handling the unconscionable seating. I didn't write a letter then but vowed not to take Rouge again. However Rouge became the only option on a recent return trip to Tampa. I had the same negative experience.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked business class with Aeroplan direct flight Toronto to Cancun only to end up on AC Rouge not by choice. Flight 1810 January 8/15. Premium Rouge is not close to AC business class level at all and I don't feel it should be charging the same amount of points for Premium Rouge. Usually you are served water or juice on arrival to aircraft but there was a delay with that. The overhead bins above the middle seat section were too small to accommodate most regular size carry-ons. The inflight entertainment was non-existant and iPads were offered free to Premium rouge customers $15 for economy customers. We could have used our own iPads to watch the movies offered if we had known and downloaded an app for this. We were told this quite rudely by the air attendant who seemed quite annoyed we didn't already know that is how it's done on AC rouge. The iPads weren't handed out for an hour and collected about 45 min prior to landing so we did not get to finish our movies. You were also unable to hear any announcements when you had earphones in listening to the iPads which I'm sure is not allowed by the safety guidelines. The first drink service was after the iPads. The meal was very tasty and good but too bad no switch up with menu as we had flown previous day with same menu. Seats smaller and very old and no support. I am not sure if they were short staffed that day or what but all the attendants seemed very unhappy and rude. I would never fly this airline by choice and I think Air Canada should have a serious look at keeping this airline. We were unhappy in business class so I cannot imagine how those in economy felt.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
LAS to YYC was the worst I have experienced. Seats are jammed in. They are narrow and there is no room between the seat in front of you. I am only 5' 7" but could not sit straight with my knees together. They were jammed into the seat in front of me. I could not put my laptop on the tray unless it sat at an angle. Entertainment system was a joke. First of all they announced after we were asked to put our phones on flight mode to download the Air Canada Ap. This information should have been announced in the boarding lounge. Even if you had the ap it could not be used until 45 minutes after we left the gate and had to be turned off when we started our descent (1/2 hour before landing). Staff announced we were headed for Vancouver; not Calgary. They seemed like this was their first flight and were unsure of everything. They were like excited kids but not helpful. This is the first and last time I will flying Air Canada Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YUL-LAS 767-300. I knew it was going to be bad but still I was curious to fly rouge and experience it. The plane was very old worn and dirty non existent leg-room poor selection of movies from their wifi IFE cabin crew okay but very young and inexperienced never felt safe with them food options a joke and unhealthy. This product would be acceptable if low cost but the prices are the same as AC mainline and the offering is tremendously below standards. I had better flights with real low cost carriers in Europe or Asia for 1/10 of the price paid. Good things landed on time and my baggage arrived too. I won't get rouged ever again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
If I can help it there is no way I will utilize Air Canada Rouge again. The leg room is terrible - my knees were jammed into the seat in front of me the whole time from Toronto to Phoenix and for the return flight back. If the person in front of you reclines their seat it is absolute torture. Out of 4 flights in total from Ottawa to Phoenix we had 7 planes due to mechanical failures. Very archaic options for in flight entertainment. If I could give 0 stars for "Value for Money" and "Seat Comfort" I would.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
If you have ever enjoyed flying book a trip with Air Canada Rouge they will change you forever. We travel from YYZ to SJO frequently and usually with Avianca. This time we flew with Rouge - what a mistake! The lack of seat room is just unacceptable our friend could not even get his tray down had to eat of his wife's tray. This really is an airline of last resort unless of course you are a midget on a diet. Be warned!

### Air Canada rouge customer review

Toronto to San Diego / return and lucky to have aisle seat. Loading time is long as middle and window seat passengers have to squeeze in and out. I'm 5'10" and my knees touch seat in front.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Regular Air Canada customer and had probably the worst airline experience that I can remember. Flight 1807 from San Jose to Toronto on Jan.4th. Initially scheduled to arrive on Sunday afternoon then changed some time ago to Monday morning at 1.40am. Plane was then delayed with no explanation for two hours and sat on the runway for another 25 minutes. The new seat spacing is absurd. If you are over 5ft 10 do not use this airline. Arrived Toronto approx. 4.30am on Jan 5th with partner and two younger kids to find that the bags did not arrive with the plane. To date no info on when they will arrive.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
The first and last time I fly Rouge. What a disappointment! My previous flights to Honolulu were on Air Canada not Rouge. When I boarded the Rouge jet in December 2014 I noticed there was no inflight entertainment. A 6 hour flight with no inflight entertainment? Air Canada should let travellers know that the 767's they fly to Honolulu have no inflight entertainment. Had I know this I would not have flown Rouge to Honolulu.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Recently flew from Toronto to Phoenix and were quite surprised to find ourselves on Rouge-we certainly weren't aware we were booking it. Never again. Seats were horribly uncomfortable-on the flight down my husband and I both ended up with back pain because the seat forced me to sit with my shoulders slumped forward. I've also never been on a plane with so little leg room-maybe three inches from my knees to the seat in front and I'm only 5'2". Flight back was slightly better (different seats) but still uncomfortable. We noticed several rows of "prestige" seats as we got on the plane but they were the same as all the other seats except with a bit more leg room. There were only 3 flight attendants for the entire plane one and a half of whom were dedicated to business class so service was slow. As other people have said there's no inflight entertainment unless you happen to have an iPad. I generally read so that's not an issue for me but I'd have been in trouble if my e-reader ran out of charge as there were also no plugs or usb ports available. And though it's a small thing the uniforms are hideous especially the hats which looked to be "one size fits nobody.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We had booked Air Canada Business Class seats YXY to MCO 17-26 Dec 2014 and were initially disappointed the flight out of Toronto was on Rouge (Premium). We read many reviews majority being negative but were hopeful our trip wouldn't end up as other travelers had. As it turned out we had a very enjoyable flight both directions. Even though there wasn't the customary onboard entertainment the provided iPads worked well though it would have been nice to have had them prior to takeoff for full enjoyment. I would certainly recommend flying Rouge Premium if it is within your budget and are considering a Toronto to Athens flight in the near future.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew to Phoenix from Toronto on Dec 28th Business Class and returned Jan 5 2015. Both were equally disturbing in their own way. The bottom line is that if Air Canada is going to charge full fare on a flight then it should not be "charter" quality. If I pay to fly business then I should get what I pay for. As for economy the leg room is atrocious for a 5 hour flight. If the person in front of you leans back then their seat is a few inches from your nose. Also we were not warned ahead of time that there would be no entertainment- they tell you to download the app to watch movies on an Ipad or Iphone but they provide no charging mechanism for your battery so you are forced to rent an Ipad for $10. If we are paying the same rates as a regular Air Canada flight shouldn't the entertainment be free just like on those flights? Air Canada used to be my go-to airline. No more- certainly not if I have to take a long haul flight on Rouge. They are shooting themselves in the foot. They used to claim "Best Airline in North America five years in a row". This will never happen again if they continue on this path. Extremely disappointing.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I usually fly with AC but after this experience would never fly ACR again. Flight YVR-OGG. As many have pointed out the seats are brutal. Thin (felt the guys knees in my back) no leg room and the reading lights in our row of seats didn't work. Pretty hard to read in the dark. The so-called inflight entertainment system is a joke. Only worked on the iPad and even then kept getting knocked out and then had a hard time re-connecting. Neither our android or MS systems could connect. Make sure to take your own food as the buy-on-board is expensive. The only positive was the young cheery flight crew. Overall AC has used the term discount to refer to the reduced quality of the flight experience while maintaining ridiculous prices.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Got rouged with a bait and switch on a flight from Vancouver to San Francisco at the end of October. Most miserable uncomfortable flight I have ever taken. Thank goodness it was a relatively short flight. No entertainment other than to advise me I should have downloaded their app on to my iPad before boarding. I am not tall and don't have long legs yet my knees were jammed into the seat in front of me and were quite sore by the time we landed. Do not bring anything on board to put under your seat because you will need every last cm of space. The seat was also narrower than average along with being much closer to the seat in front with a minimal recline. The direct flight to Hawaii from YVR has now been rouged and I am on a flight in February. My wife and I are already dreading the flight. Back to Seattle or Portland to get Hawaiian or Westjet from now on.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada Rouge is the worst experience I have ever had flying with this Airline and I am a loyal supporter for the last thirty-five years. As a Super Elite traveller I expect Air Canada to offer the best in comfort and service they have failed miserably with this service. Seats are horrible even in Business Class. Staff are all junior and haven't a clue what Service is. As soon as we got on our flight the Flight Attendants were in the galley eating rather than making sure the paying customers were taken care of. This continued throughout the flight. At dinner in Business Class u expect the same level of service as on the regular flights - not. Wine was not even offered although in my case the FA forgot to even put a wine glass on.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I wish I had visited this site before being Rouged. I can't believe that Air Canada looks good to me now! Toronto - Dublin return. I'm a taller woman and had to sit sideways for over 7 hours. I totally agree with the other criticisms on this site. I think the crew is tired of hearing complaints from the passengers and their attitude shows they don't have much patience left. If you are thinking of Rouge my advice is keep the trip short (nothing over a few hours) pack a lunch and download your favourite movies and music on your tablet (their media solution is a joke and wouldn't play on my tablet). If you're tall or big resist the temptation!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Vancouver to Honolulu on Air Canada Rouge in December 2014 - this was the worst flight ever. Seats were the most uncomfortable and the inflight entertainment service that you have to watch on your iPad froze and was not worth the effort to try to reload numerous times since it just kept freezing. For the cost of this flight I was expecting more for the money. I will not be flying with Air Canada any more for the simple fact that when the flights were booked back in July there was no mention of Rouge and there certainly was no discount for that portion of our flight. Time to get better planes if people are still paying top dollar for a long flight. I do not recommend flying rouge if your flight is over 2 hours long or if you are over 5' 8" good luck trying to fit your knees in front of you in your seat.

I'm never again going to fly Air Canada Rouge. My wife flew Rouge to Vegas in October 2014 and she said it was terrible. Just got back from Cancun yesterday and the Business Class in Rouge was just terrible. The flight attendants have no experience and are VERY young. The seats are small and tight. My wife told me the Airbus seats are worst than the Boeing seats. Being a proud Canadian I always try to fly with Air Canada when possible but Rouge is awful.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I fly around 20 times a year for work mostly on Air Canada. I've now twice had the displeasure of having to fly Rouge (once to Europe and once to Florida). In my years I've flown some bad airlines but Rouge is garbage. I truly hate this airline. Cramped seats no amenities. Nickel and dimed. Upgrades give you zero benefit for the money. Rouge is the most cynical airline I have ever flown. It signifies that Air Canada truly and officially does not care about it's customers. We are just freight. I will never ever fly Rouge again.

First time flying Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to San Diego. I usually fly the regular Air Canada flights so I was in for a surprise. I'm only 5 ft 4" but my legs were cramped in Economy. There are no screens in front of you so you needed to use your phone/tablet to see their very limited selection of movies/shows. Plus no power outlets to charge your phone so by the time you arrive to your destination your phone is nearly dead. AC rouge took the couple good things that stood out against west jet and threw it down the pipe just so they can squeeze more people in the plane. It feels like they're just in it for profit not customer satisfaction.

The in-flight entertainment is if you have a device or pay $10 for an i-pad. I had my own device but because everyone is trying to stream it didn't work. I was able to stream something for maybe 3 minutes. A customer asked the attendant and they had no idea said they would come back with a solution and never came back. The majority of the attendants were very rude on the flight over. Plus all segments on my journey to and journey from were delayed or late. They don't offer you a glass of wine like the brochure/ads say or a warm towel.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
AC1872 YUL-MCO on December 6 2014. I was flying in Premium rouge and was curious what the experience would be like given all the reviews. I'm aware that there is a vast discrepancy between Premium rouge and regular rouge service however I would have to say that I was quite pleased with my experience. On this flight the Premium rouge cabin was less than half-full and service was smooth and punctual. All staff were very friendly and ensured that any needs were met. The meal service went well with the standard mainline AC offerings and the food was moist and flavourful. iPads were distributed and while I had my own media with me I opted to try the distributed iPad simply for the experience. The library of films was a bit on the older side but for someone who isn't a cinephile the selection should be sufficient. The video quality was a bit grainy at times given the streaming service but was consistent. The seating arrangement on this A319 in Premium rouge is 3x3 with the middle seats blocked and with pillows seat-belted in where a human would otherwise be. I found the seating arrangement very roomy and to be honest I think that I actually preferred it to the mainline J cabin seating! The legroom was about the same as on the mainline J cabin. I enjoyed having the tray table space of the empty middle seat to put my drink and personal items on instead of putting them on my own tray so as to optimize space. Additionally the under-seat storage of the middle seat allowed easy access and storage for my carry-on bag without having to reach up to the overhead bin and without impeding my own legroom. The colour scheme of the Premium rouge cabin is also quite nice and is a refreshing change from the blue tones of the mainline J cabin. All in all I had a pleasant experience on Air Canada rouge in the Premium rouge cabin however I'm sure my review would be vastly different in the regular rouge cabin given how little legroom there is there (I'm 5'11 so I would be sure to notice it). Thus I would recommend flying rouge so long as you can get a seat in Premium rouge.

This is the second time we booked Air Canada and was bumped to Rouge. We paid for Air Canada and got its cousin Rouge. As a Super Elite (MM) member I was outraged that Air Canada has the arrogance to throw 5 members of my family on this 3rd world service. Seat too small flight attendants were mostly arrogant and ignorant except for one mid cabin FA. Can't charge a phone uniforms look like they are out of a bad movie. I'll be using Westjet for any flights that are not guaranteed "Air Canada" or Jazz.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew AC1804 and AC1805 from YYZ to MBJ with a friend and 6 other traveling companions. Our hotel accommodation was booked on our own and not as a part of Air Canada Vacations therefore my review is based on the flight experience alone. My standards are not very high. Although I personally work in the customer service industry I live in a small town and am used to small planes with limited leg room and limited services. However for a flight from Toronto to Jamaica I expected much more. As I am rather short I did not have an issue with the leg room but I can see how others may. How can you have a 4+ hour flight with NO in flight entertainment? Yes IF you have an iPad you can use their "app" to stream movies and TV but the selection was absolutely horrid and the service did not work BOTH legs of our trip. On the way down only the TV shows would stream and on our return both did stream but the application crashed every 1-5 minutes meaning you would need to relaunch the application and find your spot all over again. In a 4 hour flight we only got through about 1 hour of our movie. If I am ever forced to fly with them again I will make sure to download films prior to leaving or bring a magazine with me - Lesson learnt. Even more frustrating was the lack of communication surrounding this the flight attendants would constantly say they were resetting the wifi and to stay off of the app for apx 5 minutes while they did this but no announcement was ever made to the other passengers.. so maybe this is why it never worked. On my return trip I had kindly and politely requested a beverage from 2 separate flight attendants - It never came after about an hour I ringed my service bell 3 times still never came.. attendants were never seen again until landing. Perhaps the full capacity Boeing 757 was too much for the crew to handle I am genuinely not sure. I absolutely loved my vacation but the flight was legitimately the only downside of my experience. If this airline was incredibly low in cost it may be worth the sacrifice but since WestJet is approximately the same fare I will travel to the next city over and travel with them next time I go to Jamaica.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Not worth flying Rouge unless you are small in stature. Disappointingly tight legroom. Actually laughed when I got to my seat and saw how little legroom there was and then cried when the person in front of me reclined their seat into my knees. First time I ever had my 11 year old daughter commenting how cramped the seats were. Although the flights were cheap there were comparable deals available for the same itineraries with better comfort levels. Booked as codeshare on United and tried to reserve seats in advance but was unable to so. Very long holds on the phone with AC (30 minutes excellent deterrent). As a Star Alliance Gold was disappointed with this level of service. Everything else was roughly as expected. Will make a point of avoiding Rouge in the future.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Full flight YYZ-CUN. Seats are hard and the leg room is laughable but the plane was clean plenty of food options and the flight attendants were courteous prompt and served up plenty of beverages throughout the entire flight. Coming from some atrocious US Airways and United Flights good service and a clean plane makes all the difference. Not as bad as they say and better than some of the other NA carriers.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
LAS - YVR connecting to YYC and return YYC to LAS non stop. Booked in the Premium Rouge cabin. There are three rows of 3 x 3 however the middle seat is left unoccupied with two oversized red pillows. The catering is identical to Air Canada Business Class with a menu provided with entrée choices food is served hot and is good quality and sufficient quantity. Service was professionally casual. My only suggestion for a better service experience would be to hand out the iPads sooner to allow for more access. On both flights the iPads were handed out well after take-off and then they are being collected back just after the pilot announces the descent of the aircraft which leaves about 30-45 minutes of time when you could be enjoying some entertainment to pass by the time for those who don't read books or bring their own entertainment equipment.

I was on rouge yesterday for a 5 hour flight from Toronto to Phoenix and it was the worst flight of my life! There was no leg room - never ever again!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
The worst experience. The 767 appeared like it was built in the 60's. Dull dingy worn arm rests. Sears looked worn and out of date. On the way to Las Vegas they played two movies on the big screen and on the way home none. I will never fly them again. Air Canada should be ashamed.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YVR-OGG-YVR. What a let down! I am a 100 000+miles/year traveller and I was truly disappointed with AC Rouge. It's not cheap the service is a skeleton of what it should be seats are very uncomfortable (they simply do not recline). Plane had technical issues both ways (no Wifi engines would not start etc) seriously - none of this is very confidence building pre-flight. There were delays both ways premium Rouge does not look much better. Huge disappointment and makes one really reconsider loyalty to Air Canada and it's brand.

Flight with Canada Air Rouge from Toronto to Orlando. 3 hours of a nightmare. Almost no space for legs a real squeeze the plane was dirty toilets dirty staff seemed to be fed up not even a glass of water during a 3 hour trip thank you Air Canada Rouge never again.

12//20/2015 flew to Toronto out of Phoenix AZ. The leg room was very poor. I am 5ft 10 my knees were about 1 inch from the seat in front of me. Flight crew and flight was good. Coming back from Toronto the seats were even worse when I sat down in my seat my knees were touching the seat in front of me poor guy across from me was about 6ft 1 or 2 when the person in front of you decides to recline the seat the seat is about 14 inches from you nose. When most passengers were loaded we had to wait for a couple of stragglers about 45 minutes 5.5 hrS on the plane ended up being 6.5 hrs. Flight crew and flight was good.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flight #1897 December 26th. 40 minutes to give us our iPads - there was only 6 of us sitting in Business Class! As the other passengers were served first in a 3 hour flight we couldn't even watch a 2 hour movie. No warm towels prior to dinner no offer of wine with dinner no bread rolls no offer of tea or coffee after. If you are going to charge Air Canada Business Class prices - we deserve Air Canada's business class service. We were forced to fly Air Canada Rouge but the service was not different than flying with WestJet and paying $25.00 for a premium seat. Could have saved ourselves at least $300.00/per person. Which will be our next choice if this service/price does not improve.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
A very early flight from SFO to YVR during the holiday crush was made pleasant by an extremely pleasant and helpful team of flight attendants. I travel a lot and this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to praise cabin service. Thanks for making what I expected to be a miserable experience into a very pleasant one.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked an AC Vacations package and got rouged. I'm average size and had about 3" of knee room. Seat was uncomfortable outgoing I had a knee massage from the tall man seated behind me who was clearly struggling in his seat. My partner was served cold coffee and got a shrug when we mentioned it. A women in the row ahead was served cold tea and the flight attended loudly blamed the passenger for putting milk in the tea. Late in the flight I happened to see a flight attendant racing through the cabin silently waving a water jug in front of her body. I suppose that is the Rogue way of offering customers a glass of water? She breezed past our row ignoring our "excuse me". Lesson: carefully check any AC vacations flights to verify the airline. No need to pay extra when you can get better service on Skyservice or Air Transat.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We were put on Air Canada since our flight with Lufthansa (Munich - Orlando) was cancelled due to Lufthansa strikes. Air Canada Munich - Toronto was ok. The flight from Toronto to Orlando with Air Canada Rouge was a nightmare. The space between rows was almost zero (maybe 15cm) the seat comfort non existent since the whole body was squeezed into a ridiculous narrow space. The aircraft was absolutely packed and the service was accordingly. We were not offered any drinks at all not even water. Drinks and snacks had to be paid for. The crew seemed to be put off and their faces and behavior were off putting for passengers too. The toilets were dirty. If we can avoid flying Air Canada in future we will do so just in case we are placed in Air Canada Rouge again. Never again!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Round trip to Orlando from Toronto. So I can put up with horrible seating for 3 hours but sat delayed on arrival for a while due to snow. The crew tried telling us to stay "seated" but no luck. Time to revolt. The absolute worst seating. I will connect jump on any other carrier drive or walk before Rouge ever gets another dime from us unless they move the seats back. All for 2 more rows? Time to listen to your loyal customers and free us from Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We have had the unfortunate experience of flying AC Rouge on two recent trips one to Rome and one to Cuba. This is without doubt the worse excuse for an airline anywhere. The staff are poorly trained slow and disinterested. The seats are way beyond uncomfortable - for anyone over 5'8" they are brutal. The food is atrocious and the entertainment non existent. I normally fly AC wherever I go in Canada or overseas but will not use AC Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YVS to LAS on Christmas eve. Flight left close to on time and arrived on time but took forever to find a gate. The flight itself was OK. No real positives aside from on time departure and arrival. The seating is incredibly cramped seats are the most uncomfortable ive experienced and the crew are stretched and stressed. Inflight entertainment is also non-existent even with the AC app that kept on crashing. I get the idea of no-frills airlines but call it what it is (don't fly as AC) and the price really isn't that much cheaper. I'll be back to United or Westjet next time.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Terrible I am 6'2" and my legs were cramping up. Felt sorry for the passenger in front of me as my knees were in her back. I stood up as much as I could to make the flight from Phoenix to Toronto bearable. Needed an app to use iPad on flight but had no idea ahead of time. Those who had app didn't do much better as system kept failing.

My husband and I were booked to fly from Honolulu to Vancouver on Air Canada Rouge on Thursday December 18 at 11.15pm. Moments after pushing back from the gate the pilot addressed the passengers to tell us there was a small problem with the brakes and maintenance would be called to inspect and repair them. After several announcements and hours later there was no resolution. The Air Canada ground staff had no authority to provide answers to the passenger. By 2.30am we still had zero information and the Air Canada staff told us they could not provide us with food vouchers or water. They had no access to blankets or pillows either. Families with small children and infants as well as the elderly were unfortunately required to be patient or leave the gate and go to a hotel as their own expense. By 4.30 am we were still at the gate but the flight crew was relieved of their duty and sent to a hotel. Passengers demanded answers and grew angrier but the ground crew was unable to provide any assistance as they waited for instructions from head office. By 6.30am we were told that Air Canada was trying to find hotel accommodations for the passengers but we needed to be patient. By 7.15 we were instructed to go and wait downstairs and a shuttle bus would take us to a nearby airport hotel. Again there was no assistance to escort families with children or the elderly to the shuttle bus location. By 7.45am the first of three buses arrived and we were taken to the hotel. Hotel staff told us to wait as they had not been given authority to check us in. In total the last passenger to be checked in at the hotel was processed by 10am. Air Canada Rouge is the worst airline I have ever experienced.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew YUL-LAS a few weeks ago. First of all mechanical issues we were delayed 75 mins out of the gate. Second as most Rouge commenters here no IFE (bring your iPad for a selection of outdated movies) you get an ice-filled Coke (maybe 30 ml at best) and uncomfortable cramped seats. The fellow next to me was overweight and snored/slept on my shoulder the entire trip. They ran out of food too which angered a lot of passengers at the back. To make things worse we had no gate assigned in Vegas and sat on the tarmac for 40 mins. Luggage somehow also took an addition 35 mins. Yes it was direct from Montreal that was the only redeeming feature. However next Vegas trips in 2015 (2 of them) will be booked on other carriers (American Delta or WJ) AC Rouge will never have my money huge contrast with the main airline which that is average at best.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada Rouge is not recommended for tall people due to the extremely cramped legroom in economy class. Flew from YVR-LAS on Air Canada Rouge the seat is very disappointing very little legroom. It's like sardines being packed into a can. Staff service was okay. Food was average and they really need to improve the inflight entertainment. The things I would say to improve Air Canada Rouge is to increase legroom to at least 33" inches. And Premium Rouge on Boeing 767 aircraft should have flat bed seating instead of cheap recliners. Think about it Air Canada Rouge. Do something that can improve customer/inflight service.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Must say I'm very sad that the Air Canada Vancouver to Maui flight is now Rouge. I typically fly that route 3x per year. I have chosen to fly AC over Westjet for years because of the comfort. Well it isn't comfortable anymore. Shame on you Air Canada! I feel like I should say something positive first - the staff are young and fresh. Now the negative: First it was the most I have ever paid for a flight to Maui $1400. That doesn't seem like a budget airline to me. I felt like I was being gouged. Secondly it is first time I have arrived with a sore back. The seats look not bad but they are horrible!! I'm not tall so the space was Ok but the seats the worst possible design for your back and they barely recline at all. I'm dreading the night flight back! Finally the wifi entertainment system (that I was actually looking forward to) has an old and poor selection of movies and TV shows transmits in very low resolution and crashes every 10 minutes or so. I did persevere with one movie but had to restart it at least 7 times. Bye bye Air Canada! I've always been a supporter but think I'll be booking with Westjet next time.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Our son lives in Canada. We have traveled numerous times to Toronto out of Phoenix AZ. We had not heard of AC Rouge until our son booked the flight to Toronto in the latter part of Nov. Then I started looking on the Internet about AC Rouge. We never buy food or drinks nor movies on any plane so no problem there. Flight was good other than the terrible seating i am 5'10 and my knees were touching the seat in front of me then the guy in front of me moved his reclining seat back then it made his seat about 14" from my face. Such terrible leg room makes it quite an ordeal for anybody going to the restroom.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
If Rouge were indeed a discount airline at discount pricing I would get it. But it's not. You pay full fare to sit with your knees in your chin to have inflight entertainment that is older than my grandfather and food that isn't fit to be served to livestock. Truly a race to the bottom. Old Air Canada slogan "We're not happy unless you're not happy" Sad but very true. 5 hours from Toronto to St Martin. Suicide would have been less painful.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YVR-PVR-YVR Dec 6-13/14. I would advise you not to travel with Rouge if you are above average size as seating is extremely tight. Since I am of average size and my flights were on time I can hardly fault them. I also got a great deal on this particular flight but this was definitely an anomaly as I see the flights for the same route to PV are now upwards to $1200. I'm ok paying cheap fares for cheap product/service but $1200 for a 5 hour flight is ridiculous in the extreme. I only paid about a 1/3 of that for these particular flights which makes this review ok. BRING your own entertainment. Food is buy on board same as everyone else. I've flown Westjet on this route lots of times and Westjet is no better or worse. They are extremely tight and no cheaper. My advice is know what you are getting into and do not pay/sit in Premium (not worth the extra $$). If the flight is too expensive then vote with your feet. Unfortunately we are a captive audience as Westjet's prices are the same if not higher.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Yes it was a great deal but c'mon! The staff was just ok no TV's or screens but you can rent an iPad for $10.? Like we are already not paying enough to airlines. No music stations either. The only advantage of my flight was that no one was next to me (sheer luck!) so I was able to stretch and sleep. The plane was dirty and you can see that the sides on the floor have not been vacuumed or cleaned in a long time.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Just returned Vancouver/Maui return in worst flight of my life. Air Canada switched to Air Rouge after we had paid for business class and value for money was atrocious. Both ways drink tray would not pull out and only one reading light worked. Used warm facecloth to wipe down table top and arm rest (filthy). Table tray in arm rest reduced seat width. No lumbar support in seat. Middle row had to ask to have reading lights turned off for whole section on return (red eye) flight so they could sleep. Food on flight over acceptable breakfast meal on return flight edible. The only 2 good things I can say about the complementary IPads are: didn't have to pay for it in Premium Rouge and I finally learned how to play Angry Birds because the movie selection was "thin". Staff were "preppy" and helpful but they must be exhausted by having to constantly apologize "we're working on it" when customers complain. On return flight there was no AC on the ground in Maui and then when airborne economy class passengers froze and we sweltered in Premium Rouge. I will never fly this airline again and will think twice about AC overall.

Vegas from Toronto. When I called them to book specific seats I was on hold for over 45 mins. When I spoke to the travel site about this they said this is quite normal. We couldn't print boarding passes from their site. When called Rouge it was another 1 hour on hold. She said there seemed to be a problem with the site and to just print them out at the airport. We paid extra ($160 for 2 people/round trip) to seated by the emergency seats for the extra leg room. There seemed to be a problem with their heating because it was freezing the whole time. The food was bland and cold within seconds of receiving it. The flight attendants took forever to carry out requests.

I am an Altitude 50K member and have been for several years. I use Air Canada a lot. I swear it is the best airline in the Star Alliance and at least the Top 5 world wide. I traveled to Las Vegas this past weekend and was relegated to 'Rouge' because Air Canada does not fly there any longer. If you want to fly AC to Vegas - you must be rouged. The airfare (Flex) was more expensive (21% to be exact) then the Flex fare for September 2013. There are no amenities. No inflight entertainment. Oh sure you can watch a stream on your ipad or iphone - but there is no way to keep your device charged because in this the 21st Century some engineer decided there was no need for power supplies. Force people to watch on their electronic devices but don't allow them to charge. I used my upgrade points to 'Premium Economy' - although the ticketing laughingly refers to it as Business class. Seats are the same size as in economy no power no entertainment and yet - the same amount of credits are required. Thank god they at least had more leg room. But that's all they had. My food was adequate beverage service was slow and there are only 12 seats to serve. In the spring as I will be forced to Rouge again - and it will be the last and final time. I could go on but why bother. United Airlines here I come.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We just came back from the Dominican Republic and all I have to say about Air Canada Rouge is that the aircraft and staff are ok but the seats are the worst I have encountered and I have been flying since the early 60's. The seat basically has no bottom cushion. It is hard and extremely uncomfortable. The pitch between the seats is OK if you are 5 feet 2 but otherwise your knees hit the front seat and if by chance the front passenger reclines OUCH!!! The seat cushion is also not long enough and offers no thigh support. I will never ever fly Air Canada Rouge again until they change their seats.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Just returned from Maui originally booked business class AC and were switched to Premium Rouge without adjustment in our fare. Flight over on 5 Dec was good but drink tray broken and my reading light would not come on. Food very good and drink selection excellent. Seat area filthy and when I wiped the table tops and arm rest with my warm towelette it came back black. Inflight use of IPad nice but the system kept freezing up and having to be restarted. Flight Maui to Vancouver 14 December was awful. Air conditioner turned off on tarmac so we roasted until after take off then we still roasted in Premium and Economy froze. Same broken seat issues. Not all of the inflight IPad items were working. Crew seemed disorganized (took 45 mins to deliver breakfast trays and not all 24 people in Premium bothered to eat). Coffee offered on an individual basis Once). Overall we were terribly disappointed. My husband is an AC Elite/Altitude flyer but we have decided to go with another carrier on our Europe trip this fall. We will never fly Air Rouge and when we go back to Maui it will be with Westjet or Alaska Airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We generally find our experience in overseas travel "average" on AC compared to other airlines but our first Rouge flight to Honolulu was nightmare for us. We travel back and forth to NZ frequently. We understand the YYZ - HNL is a new service but we would encourage AC to rethink making such a long flight and large plane a Rouge flight - it just doesn't work. The cabin crew were inexperienced and completely overwhelmed. We were 4 hours into a 10 hour flight before we were offered even a glass of water. Another 4 hours before we saw them again. The back and forth required to supply meals iPad etc to passengers made the rest of the flight service very sub-standard. Once you got your iPad the entertainment selection was the worst I have ever experienced in my long years of flying. For long overseas flights (yes this is every bit an long haul international flight) AC should retain the standard approach of meals and drinks supplied at appropriate times. It was unfair to the crew and unfair to the passengers. The nickel and diming for every single thing is ridiculous (to have to pay for a blanket when the people by the windows are freezing is inhumane!) I doubt most people want their vacation to begin with such a sour experience. Even at the risk of a few more dollars on the ticket. I am sure most passengers left the flight feeling tired hungry thirsty cold and bored. We did.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
This airline demonstrates that it is a race to the bottom. I flew from Calgary to Vancouver on a regular AC flight - fine - I had 6 inches between my knees and the seat in front. From Vancouver to San Francisco my knee was jammed into the wire support for the magazine holder attached to the seat in front. Why? This was not a leisure trip - it was business - and I booked on AC.com not Rouge.com. I could not open my laptop. I got a water about 2 hours in when we stared the descent. Air Canada did have a little Rouge Logo on next to the flight. I will be avoiding that logo in the future. The upbeat uniforms and the Fedora made me even more annoyed.

Manchester - Toronto. This is without doubt the worst airline in the world. And its up against some pretty stiff competition such as Ryanair Air Asia and Spirit. I am now reluctant to use the brilliant main line Air Canada just in case they change the route to a Rouge. I hope the executives see the reviews - they have created a dreadful airline and I wonder how long it will be until this airline is wound up.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
While the services associated with flying have been going downhill in the US I just can't believe the return flight I had from Phoenix to Toronto. I am 5' 11" and I had zero leg room on my flight. There were other passengers around me who were all looking bewildered and as a group the feeling was "really". So after we boarded they started playing up the rental revenue pitch for iPADS and the app they have for watching on your personal device but here is a clue AC. Why not make an announcement in the terminal area before the flight so you can download the app that you need to watch on your personal device. Absolutely nothing positive about this airline. They were not less expensive and cattle are treated with more respect. I will never fly Air Canada again because of this experience.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Having Just flown Air Canada Rouge Toronto to Dublin Ireland I would comment that the seats are much smaller than normal Air Canada flights. The seat padding is non existent there is no entertainment unless you have an apple device no other devices work and given that android is at least 1/2 of the market they should also work. Generally I will never fly Rouge or for that matter Air Canada again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Kahului Maui to Vancouver. Flight 1828 on Dec 4. We booked a regular AC flight. It was changed to Rouge. It was without a doubt the worst flight we have had and we fly quite often. The seats are hard. The seat recline is negligible. We are tall (6'4") and it was impossible to sit with knees forward. The plane was very noisy. We had another flight booked with regular AC which was also changed to Rouge. I cancelled and received a full refund.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew to Rome in September on AC and were booked on AC Rouge out of Venice. We assumed that Rouge was just a marketing gimmick. Were we wrong. Upon boarding the new 767 we all thought our 9 hour flight to Toronto would be relaxing. Then we got under way and the surprises kept coming. Cramped seats barely recognizable food no monitors for entertainment. The stewardesses took the brunt of criticism for AC Rouges lack of communicating that in fact ACR is actually a no frills carrier. Not cheaper but "no frills". Add to that $ 6.50 for a warm 4 oz. white wine and $ 10.00 for an Ipad and you get the feeling that perhaps Rouge should re-think a strategy that will cost them customers.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My wife and I flew to Phoenix mid November on Rouge. It was our first experience with Rouge not by choice and it will be the last. We flew about 5 hours each way sitting in very cramped conditions very little room when trying to walk down the aisle (passengers are not going to get out of that plane in an emergency situation) and a pathetic entertainment system. My wife found she could not turn the pages of her magazine as it lay on the table without hitting the seat back because it was so close to her. It was an almost impossible task to try to reach down to grab a bag under the seat. Flight crew did not address my concerns that I voiced twice assuring me they would come back that the seat if front of me was fully reclined (which isn't much with Rouge by the way) during landing giving me almost no space between me and the setback. My wife and I agree that we will make sure we do not fly Rouge again flying the competition instead.

Aeroplan member since 1987. Went out of my way to fly AC (even if it was a few $$ more). It's now done. AC Rouge from Las Vegas to YYZ. Full disclosure we "lucked into" front row of economy with 35" seat pitch so was not too bad however looking at those crammed into 29" pitch seats made me squirm. There are plenty of other options at the same price. After 25 loyal years I will now go out of my way to avoid AC.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I had my first experience on AC Rouge this week with a flight to and then return from Las Vegas. I am a very frequent flier almost exclusively with AC logging about 75 flights per year. Business class pretty much all the time because of upgrades. Wow this was an unpleasant surprise. Horrible seating-cramped with marginal width in the seat and little leg room. Old planes I guess so the lack of quality in flight entertainment (iPads with video choices matching the age of the planes). All this for the price of regular AC Business Class! I will never fly Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YYZ-MCO is a new low for Air Canada. This is a flight that is filled with parents and children headed to the wonderful world of Orlando and most of them have come to expect the TVs and other amenities to be a part of AC flights. That is no longer the case - no TVs no plugs and no leg room leads to a very uncomfortable flight for all. I'm a AC super elite passenger and do anything I can to avoid taking the rouge flight including driving 3 hours to Fort Lauderdale to catch the AC proper flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
While the service is similar to a regular Business Class flight on Air Canada the seating is in no way business or premium. The seats are narrow with limited leg room - there is no arm rest or power outlets. The large pillows you receive take up the centre seat as a business traveler if I pay more and I expect more from Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
HNL- YVC 15-12-14. We had been advised that our return flight was to be with AC Rouge. Having read a number of negative items concerning Rouge we were not expecting anything different. However we went with an open mind. The crew were professional and gave good service considering that it was a red eye flight. Departure and arrival were both timely. We sat in preferred seating which was much better than the regular economy seating. The seats were comfortable however did not recline too much. From a safety perspective I was unable to hear some of the announcements. There was no track lighting in the aisles. The overhead directional lighting did not work. Overall the aircraft 767-300 was clean. The toilets were cleaner than other AC flights that I have taken. The food for purchase was good however way overpriced. The funky uniforms of the flight attendants could be more professional. Ditch the hats. This is considered a no frills concept. They didn't miss the mark in that statement. The cost however is greater than mainline AC. I downloaded the AC Rouge APP and viewed some of the movies etc. They could do better as a lot of the downloads were old. For example I love Lucy Auntie Maime etc. Not worth purchasing the $10.00 iPad usage. Would I fly AC Rouge again? Firstly we fly every year to Hawaii. AC provided good service and we enjoyed those flights. We will no longer fly AC Rouge.

I might as well join the ranks of most of the reviewers Travel AC1810 29 Nov YYZ-CUN B767 and AC1813 6 Dec CUN-YYZ A319. Both flights on time Inflight service about the same as AC mainline Inflight entertainment not bad but content very dated. Seat comfort - B767 leg room about the same as a lot of Westjets B737 A319 leg room my wife is 5'6" she didn't enjoy the return flight at all I" 6'4' and scored the 18F emergency exit window (no 17F in front of you) so legroom wasn't an issue with me this time if I haven't been able to score 18F I know I would have been in for a world of pain. The seat has very little padding and the front on the seat is angled down so you feel like you could slide off the seat. As for recommending to others if you are travelling to a Sun Spot for holidays you have very little choice for a comfortable non stop flight these days on any Canadian carriers. The trend is squeezing more seats on an aircraft world-wide and passenger comfort is impacted.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada Rouge is a service that should be eliminated. I paid for a preferred seat on a flight from Toronto Ontario to Liberia Costa. The seat was cramped and I am average weight at 5'7". There are only 3 sandwich offerings of which they ran out of one before the flight was a third complete. If you need to use the toilet facilities it is difficult as the carts were frequently in the aisles blocking the access to the only bathrooms at the rear of the plane. When I asked if I could use the toilet in the Premium section I was told I had to wait until the beverage service was complete in my section. When the attendant was not looking I used the Premium toilets. The fact that you must use your own devices to watch movies is the biggest money extraction ploy. There were no plugs to recharge devices. Staff were pleasant but working in difficult circumstances. Never will I use this service again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My husband I recently flew on Rouge YYC-LAS return. We were to this point both loyal AC customer and my husband is Super Elite. Air Canada Rouge is a step back air travel! The seats are cramped my husband is 5'10" and his knees were touching the seat in front of him. And that was without them reclining! The flight was very cramped and uncomfortable. I cannot imagine a long haul flight with this airline. Well in fact we won't do it. The entertainment system is terrible a bunch of old movies I have already seen. Doesn't even come close to Air Canada's system. I will not fly Rouge again it is a discount airline that costs the same. And they just announced Air Canada is rolling out domestic Rouge flights from YYC. VERY disappointing. Guess we will be flying WestJet a lot more from now on.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Less for more. London(ON)-Toronto-Tampa return on Rouge. Small seats and no screens so it was impossible to see the safety demonstration. 3 cabin crew who were expected to serve close to 200 passengers. On the way down one toilet was closed and on the way back one toilet had no water for washing but the crew had thoughtfully put a few packs of handwipes in the toilet. Drinks while going up in price arrived pre-poured not cans of mix and miniatures.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Rouge is to be avoided whenever possible. I have travelled both in Economy and in their "Premium Class" which is the same economy seat with the middle seat left unsold. A few inches greater leg room but with a huge increase in price. Air Canada has made a huge miscalculation.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Toronto to Phoenix in Premium Rouge and was was very disappointed with the quality of this section. Instead of wider seats the seats are three across with middle seat blocked. I'm not impressed with the iPad entertainment system either. On other AC flights one can start watching a movie while still on the ground. In this case we were several minutes in the air before getting the iPad. The selection of movies and TV programs was poor and not to my taste at all. The staff were friendly but were absent a lot. I will avoid Air Canada Rouge in the future.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew from Honolulu to Vancouver AC Rouge Nov. 29th 2014. This was a very disappointing flight for many of the following reasons. Changed our tickets from AC to AC Rouge. No leg room and we are not tall. Seats uncomfortable. I completely froze all night long. I requested a blanket and they said yes for eight dollars. No entertainment unless you pay ten dollars for an iPad unable to see the safety demo.. Unable to sleep as crew in seat behind us talked and laughed all night. We will not fly AC Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Recent flight on Air Canada rouge was terrible. The seats were so uncomfortable and narrow. The "new" entertainment they couldn't get working. This flight was terrible and unfortunately I have three more flights booked with them. My mother was in Premium Rouge and the seats weren't much wider and yet they charge hundreds more. My advise is don't waste your money. Pick another option any option is better than Air Canada rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Paid extra for premium seats which were no better than economy on a regular flight. Leg room was horrible. Service from attendants was the worse I have had on any flight ever! The worst thing of all is that now flying direct from Toronto to Vegas this is all I can get unless I take the red eye. These flights should only be flying locally and no more than 1.5 hr flights.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I couldn't care less if the flight attendants are happy or sad or dressed like an 80's boy band. I also couldn't care less about the inflight entertainment or the food they serve. However I do expect a comfortable seat. At 6'2 200 lbs I was unable to move my legs throughout the flight. My knees were firmly lodged into the seat in front of me as well as a metal armrest on the widow side. I couldn't utilize the space under the seat for extra leg room because the pitch of the seats. It was without a doubt the most uncomfortable flight I have ever had to endure. Luckily the couple in front of me (the gentleman was also jammed into his seat) looked back and we're horrified by how I was crammed into the seat and didn't recline their seat back otherwise It would have been unbearable. My flight was only 2.5 hour so I can't even fathom being on a 6 or 8 hour flight with this airline. I have always been a big fan of Air Canada but I will never I repeat never fly Rouge again even if I was given tickets.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
With Air Canada Rouge the travel experience has been taken to a new low. We had the unfortunate experience of flying with them to Barcelona and will never travel with them again. The planes are old. I paid extra to get an exit row and was still beyond cramped. The inflight entertainment (an extra cost requiring you rent an iPad from them) features third run movies and old television series. The food is tepid and the planes desperately needed to be cleaned. Whatever you do avoid this airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YYZ-LAS return. I have been a loyal AC customer and Super Elite. Air Canada Rouge is a step back in customer service and flight comfort. The seats are cramped and uncomfortable. A four hour flight and one cup of cold tea regular flights on AC the service is night and day. I will not fly Rouge again the price of a ticket is not a bargain. Extremely disappointing.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YYZ-MCO return. Service and food were up to mainline AC business class standards however the seats were regular Rouge but with a much better seat pitch. Since they do not sell the middle seat I see no reason why they could not go the extra mile and have wider seats. All the privileges of AC Business class: free checked bags priority boarding Maple Leaf Lounge access priority security at MCO all made it worth the extra cost which was not too excessive. Not particularly impressed with the iPad entertainment system but it worked and there was a reasonable choice of things to watch. This is by far the only way to survive Rouge. I looked back to the cheap seats and it looked awful: an impression confirmed by some who traveled back there. Not up to AC Business Class mainly due to the poor seating but acceptable for a relatively short flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
As a paraplegic I have no complaints about how the airline handled me. I have flown Air Canada for years and all that has come to a stop I flew AC 1891 on October 25th 2014. Tampa to Toronto. While I do not fault the airline for its taking off late (was boarded first 30 minutes late) As a result of rainy weather (I assume) we sat waiting on the runway for an hour. Once we did take off there was one food cart don't order food as I have found all the items disgusting (especially the veggie wrap). They also had one beverage cart. Food cart came first. I like to have a glass of wine or at least water while I fly. One hour and ten minutes in to the flight I was finally offered a beverage. I am 5 ft 4 and 125 pounds and I was packed in to the seat. If you are over 5 ft 9 I would not book AC rouge. There was zero entertainment on board. As I am accustomed to watching a film when I fly I did not bring reading material. No TV. No music no view nothing. Also to add insult to injury I flew AC rouge last time business class and don't bother. Seats are three across with a pillow in the middle seat. The seats are not comfortable and the price outrageous!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew from Vancouver to Honolulu on what I thought was Air Canada but was instead Rouge. It was the most uncomfortable flying experience I've had in years of travel on many airlines. Checking in at Vancouver International was handled by Air Canada ground staff in the usual courteous and efficient way but when boarding the aircraft I was surprised to see the flight attendants dresses in their ridiculous uniforms and hats and the drab decor of the aircraft. I squeezed into my seat and soon realized the next six hours were going to be an ordeal. Are you kidding me? I am very average slim 6 feet in height and I could not sit in my seat with my knees in front of me. The seats are hard barely recline and are immensely uncomfortable. The flight attendants were pleasant when they were around. No entertainment cramped seats beyond description made for a very long six hours. I am very disappointed to learn that Rouge is taking over all flights to Honolulu. This move by Air Canada is a terrible business decision. I will book with any other airline other than Rouge in the future. Never again Rouge!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada Rouge is an experiment that has to go away. I flew from Toronto to Phoenix and at 5' 10" was crammed into my seat with absolutely no leg room. The service was horrendous and many 'customers' of Air Canada were more than unhappy after the five hour flight. The wifi entertainment system complete with antiquated movies and shows was intermittent and froze at regular intervals.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have had the unfortunate experience of having no choice but to have to fly with Air Canada 'Rouge'. Trying to make a more uncomfortable way of flying just as expensive as before sound 'cool'. I am a frequent flyer with Air Canada but I am seriously considering not flying with them anymore because of these new ways of trapping us. I am supposed to be flying to Maui in January and they get you because you have no choice but to fly Rouge for the last long leg of the journey from the west coast to Hawaii. I have flown premium (which was really not premium at all from the USA with not even a meal or drinks and I have flown economy which is smarter because you don't get much difference for how much more you have to pay.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
This is the worst ever airline I have had the misfortune of flying. My husband didn't even have enough room to sit with his legs in the seat. He is 6'3". Had to sit with his legs in the aisle. The seats have a slant so that you cannot sit comfortably. The seat in front of us was in our face it is so close. This flight to Europe had food that made plastic taste good. Breakfast! A joke. There is absolutely no entertainment? Well unless you wanted to rent an iPad. If I could rate less than one star I would.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
A319 YYC to LAS return - the most uncomfortable aircraft I have ever flown in. With my seat back upright and the person in front of me reclined it 13 inches from his seatback to my nose - you don't have to think too hard to guess what the leg room was like. It amazes me to what lengths these airlines go in cramming seats into claustrophobia situations and people just take it.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My husband is just over 6 feet tall. Not abnormally tall for a man. He had the centre seat in economy and he was not able to sit with his knees in front of his body. I can't believe that air travel has stooped to such an amazing low. We flew home from San Francisco - not even a candy to pass around the cabin. Pretty sad and cheap. The staff while pleasant enough couldn't rattle off the safety spiel fast enough. I really do despair at how low air travel has fallen. Maybe the price does need to go up because this competitive cheap pricing just makes me want to spend any vacation I have at home.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
By far the most uncomfortable flight I've experienced! Flew to Phoenix and back on same plane last week. Not much leg room. Tough to get out. Didn't recline seat because it will give rear passenger even less space. Felt bad for people above 5' and people with disabilities. Entertainment not worth it. Movies were outdated. Won't fly Air Canada if this is their new way of flying. Will go for West Jet!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flight 1914/1915 Sep 2014. Air Canada rouge is the worst experience I've had on an airline. I am a loyal Air Canada customer and have been flying with "status" for over 12 years and just recently flew Toronto-Barcelona in their "premium economy". The seats are incredibly hard close together and barely recline. The service is both minimal and terrible with undertrained staff who have to read the "directions" out of a book when they do the announcements. They barely served the economy customers at all and spent most of their time in the front. I will choose another airline rather than fly Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
October 5 AC 1900. I was flying from Toronto to Athens and I can only eat kosher food. When I booked I made sure to tick off that I needed kosher food and I called the day before my flight to confirm. Yet when I got on the plane they had no kosher food to speak of for me. The stewardess was completely cold and didn't even attempt to make any accommodations. I was very upset because I had a 12 hour stopover in Athens with no food on top of a 10-hour flight. I was very unimpressed.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew Toronto to Dublin when booking the flight it was simply Air Canada it wasn't until we were boarding we saw the air hostesses wearing those ridiculous trilby hats that I realised something wasn't quite right. Safe to say the worst flight I have been on. Very unprofessional staff the food was cold and horrible. Neither me nor my boyfriend ate it. The planes are very cramped and the seats are terribly uncomfortable. I definitely would not recommend them for a long haul flight. I paid $1200 to be squished in a seat for almost 8 hours with a rented tablet and a headphone dock that didn't work. Also when you usually travel with any airline you expect a certain level of professionalism in how the staff not only act but how they dress Air Canada Rouge staff look very scruffy. Shirts untucked unbuttoned as I said ridiculous hats just not what you would usually expect-but maybe that last part is just me!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Very surprised wrote a negative review just a few months ago. Took same flight in November and it has changed very much for the better. New aircraft 767 great leg room (was my biggest beef in first review) very comfortable flight. Crew were professional plane was on time and the plane was in GREAT shape. They honoured seat selection and made check in easy. We enjoy going to Cancun a few times each winter and I am glad they changed the leg room for better.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Very disappointed with Air Canada Rouge. I thought that after reading the negative reviews online before our travels it would surely not be that bad but alas our experience was as disappointing as the many previous reviews. If you are hoping that Rouge will 'get you into the mood' for your vacation then you should seriously think about choosing a different carrier. Flew YYZ to LAS on Nov 6th 2014 on a 767. Nothing has been updated on this aircraft except for the new thinner seats. Leg space is inadequate. The carpet looked like it had not been cleaned. Reading lights did not work and after asking two crew members why not the response was 'not sure'. The poor people in the rows ahead reading lights stayed on the entire flight and could not be turned off. Inflight movie and TV selection is very poor and only available on your mobile device otherwise $10 to rent an iPad. Being a proud Canadian this is not an airline that makes me proud at all. A Star Alliance member offering this product really? You can do better. I will certainly not book on Air Canada Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Paid for first class but we just had an empty seat between my husband and I. We feel like we were mislead and very dissatisfied with the quality of the service. Letting me use an ipad for a few hours was not worth the extra hundred's of dollars.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
The worst long distance flight I have experienced - Toronto to Venice (flew Air Canada from Vancouver to Toronto). The trip from Toronto could not have been more unpleasant from staff to seating entertainment and meals. Unable to see steward giving safety information (no video equipment). Dinner was delivered consisting of pasta which had freezer burn with a tough and flavourless beef stew on top. No choices. Drinks were not offered. Managed to get some water. Breakfast was 1/2 piece of banana loaf. Coffee came in tiny cups - no refills ever offered even after request. Seats cramped - no personal control of air conditioning etc. Very cold in our section. If I had wanted to watch anything I would have had to rent an I-pad for $10 since I do not own one. Crew seemed to do a required task and then totally disappear. They were not in any way gracious or helpful. My carry on was specifically purchased to meet all the restrictions of this flight but could not fit either under the seat or in the overhead bin. I could have done this flight on another airline and wish to heaven I had - the cost would have been the same or at most only very little more. Never again! I have tried over the years to be a supporter of Air Canada and although I have had some flights which were less than advertised this one was unbelievably awful and Air Canada does not deserve any kudos for their 'discount' (not) airline!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Dublin to Toronto return. Okay the seats aren't the most comfortable in the world too thin and seem to lean slightly too far forward but otherwise I had no issues and my back survived both ways. There is less space overall on the plane compared to other transatlantic flights but I was still able to get up and walk around. I was aware before hand that you needed an iPad to watch the inflight entertainment so I had books etc with me instead. The food is the best airline food I've had on any flight. The staff were pleasant and polite and in dealing with one passenger with special needs on the return flight were the best I've seen on any airline. I would fly with them again. In addition unlike certain airlines - the staff were up and down the aisles frequently with extra water for passengers.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Hands down the worst airline I've ever flown on. I spent $1000 (hardly low cost) to fly one way from Las Vegas to Toronto and even at 5'8 this is beyond uncomfortable I felt like the person in front of me was sitting on my lap and I could not even open my computer on the table. The service is similar to going into a restaurant where they are on day one of training. As a Super Elite member I truly hope Air Canada rethinks this strategy or they are certain to lose business travellers. I hear they are going to Vancouver/Calgary now as well I am not sure how those are vacation destinations.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew from Montreal to Barcelona on October 8. The seats were so uncomfortable. Not having a screen is really unpleasant since the space is so limited that even holding an iPad becomes difficult. The hot meal was quite good although it is really trimmed down to the bare essentials. Cheap cellophane wrapped piece of cake that is meant to be breakfast! Were is the juice? The yogurt? The fruit? Really pitiful. I will not fly Rouge again if I can help it.

YEG-BCN. Return flight late - 8 hours. Service poor - lack of professionalism no attention to detail. International flight and I had to pay for wine with a poor dinner. Poor selection of entertainment and tiny seats.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Toronto to Athens in July 2014. Narrow  hard and uncomfortable seats. Only older movies available on the in flight entertainment system using your own ipad. Cost of flight was comparable to going Air Canada and Lufthansa or Aegean with a connection so Rouge is definitely not a low cost airline. Not sure what AC's strategy is .Only benefit was that it was a direct flight rather than having to connect. Would not fly Rouge again other than perhaps on a 3 hour flight to Florida. Never again on a long haul flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Oct 19 - Toronto-Dublin Flight 1908. Oct 31 - Dublin-Toronto - Flight 1909. Outbound flight was not very pleasant staff didn't seem to care. Food was terrible. Terminal One not user-friendly i.e. very little staff presence to assist with machines and gate direction. Was sent all around the terminal to another security checkpoint - by most unfriendly personnel who were quite impatient. Shops are very high end and expensive. Range from a glorified newsagent to Gucci and Victoria Secret shops. Other terminals have good quality T-shirts sweat shirts souvenirs etc. at reasonable prices. I paid $15 for a small glass of wine. Absolutely ridiculous! Inbound flight was entirely different. Staff was very friendly helpful and cheerful. Food wasn't too bad - but not the greatest. Noticed flight attendants were more on the ball and seemed to enjoy their work. An opportunity for In Flight Duty Free Shopping would have been nice.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
First time on AC Rouge on March 2014. At check-in the kiosk wasn't working when I placed my CC in for the extra bag had to queue which had only 1 agent for everybody - later I found out the kiosks weren't working for anybody. At check-in the agent told me I have a standby boarding pass and the 'SSSS' on it means that I had been randomly selected for extra scrutiny. At the gate the agent called me up and gave me a seat and I asked may I have another she ignored the inquiry and said that's the only one and walked away rudely. My seat in the last row didn't recline. Entertainment system does not with android devices. During the drinks service due to turbulence they stopped serving at the last 5-6 rows and didn't bother to come back when it stopped. I asked for coffee which was served cold. In short I'm not quite sure what the purpose of AC Rouge is - to offer lower fares? The amount we paid for the ticket and the high cost to change - what value are we getting?

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Toronto to Phoenix flight on Rouge. Nice staff but rotten plane. Made my way to my aisle seat and found the middle seat was taken a very big man. He had the arm rest up because he had trouble sitting in the seat. I asked politely to put the arm rest down. He spilled over the arm rest into my seat. I could see he was very uncomfortable and now I was uncomfortable as I only had half my seat and leg room. Requested another seat with attendant but no other seats available. What a long 5 hours. What is Air Canada doing with these Rouge planes. Entertainment on iPads is terrible. Where did all the new movies go?

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have been flying rouge pretty much every week from YVR to SFO. Fares have been ridiculously high (more then 550$ each way for a 2 hour flight). Thus this is not a low cost carrier but they still want to provide a LCC service and discomfort. The only thing saving this airline is the crew. They are usually friendly. Seats are extremely close to each other to the point that most people can't fit (I am pretty slim and only 5'10"). In addition rouge plus is not worth the extra money (no AVOD and normal economy class seat).

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Dublin to Toronto. I found the flight fine. There are two problems with this airline lack of leg room and the lack of seat back screens. As I'm not that tall the lack of leg room didn't bother me but can see a problem if you are. I downloaded the app onto my ipad. The films were outdated so wouldn't bother with that. The staff were friendly and professional. The food was nice for airline food. Overall I enjoyed my flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Dublin to Toronto return - flights very busy but despite that check-in and crew were calm polite and efficient both ways. Space is no worse than many other airlines and food also comparable. The iPad system worked well - and gives better control / screen than many other seat back systems. My only complaint would be other passengers being late to the gate with large pieces of hand luggage!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Very disappointed Air Canada rouge. No entertainment systems! Surprised we had to provide our own iPads but really no big deal. Selection of movies to watch is poor. Such cramped leg room for economy passengers I'm only 5'10 and couldn't sit far enough back in seat without knees digging in to seat in front of me couldn't wait to land so I could stand up. Most uncomfortable flight ever. Some complimentary drinks but no free snack either.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I am a larger than average man. The seats on my flight were completely inadequate. The flight from YYZ to PHX is 4.30 long. Installing the same seats as economy and blocking one off does allow for the ergonomic support I require. Surprised upon boarding and very upset with the experience. I hope the larger seats will come back. Hope changes on this route are forthcoming or I will look for other alternatives.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My first time flying AC Rouge and AC since 2008. October 18 from Dorval flight 1820 to Cancun. Delayed 4 hours due to mechanical defect. After more than 2 hours the replacement part was not compatible so we were instructed that we will change planes. Did not mind this as safety is important and mechanical parts do brake. So we were moved to an airport bus and communication stops waiting observing but nobody was telling us what was going on. Almost 2 hours goes by before we're ready to go. Two hours into the flight we're hoping to eat but by row 15 they ran out of meals. Nobody thought of getting additional meals (as it took 4 hours before taking off) as AC Rouge do not carry a meal for every passenger. So after 8 hours and 15 minutes we land into Cancun. A little hungry! Staff were somewhat smiling no one thought of explaining what they were up against. You know we could have been more understanding with some explanation. The return 1821 was better I just brought my bag of chips just in case.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
On Monday Oct. 6 3 friends and I took Air Canada Rouge #1909 from Dublin to Toronto. We sat in seats 30CA and 31CA. As soon as the plane taxied off we noticed the reading lights did not work. Since there were no screens on the seats in front of us there was not much to do except read which we could scarcely do since it was so dark. Then it got colder and colder. We noticed it was nice and warm further back in the plane but really cold where we were. The blankets were so thin they did not help. It was quite uncomfortable. I suggest something has to be done about that uneven heating system. All told it was a most unenjoyable flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Seat was hard thin padding and armrest controls were annoying bare cabin. Seat not wide enough for thighs to rest on and I am 53. Seats very close together. Crew were kind. We flew from Toronto to Dublin and I would not use this airline again. We tried to contact the airline to upgrade in case we were on Rouge to return and could not reach them overnight in Dublin but fortunately we took a regular Air Canada from Heathrow to Vancouver - Heathrow not greatest airport for flight changes with heavy security.

Flew from LAX to Vancouver (round trip). Crew were friendly. Plan ahead and download Air Canada app so you can watch free stuff on your iPad. We brought our 6 year old son. He sat in the middle of three seats which made the flight more enjoyable since leg room was cramped.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Air Canada Rouge from Vancouver/Canada to LA/USA and then Las Vegas to Vancouver. Whoever designed this airplane seating plan should have been designing Sardine cans. At 5 feet-11.5 inches tall it was brutal with absolutely no leg room with the seat in front of me indenting my knee-caps. Both trips were the same (brutal). The only saving moment was my seat was an aisle seat allowing me to figet with one leg in the aisle. I'm never flying Rouge again!

We flew Montreal to Rome Oct 4th and back Oct 18th. We found Premium Rouge very good. Food going to Rome was good food on the return flight was excellent! We had no problems with the free iPad and the movies were up to date. In fact we liked using the iPad! Seats were roomy. Check in staff were good. Priority boarding for Premium Rouge was good. Staff both flights were excellent and attentive. Would definitely fly Rouge again but would book Premium Economy.

Flew from Vancouver to LAX. Started to feel anxious once I sat in the seat and felt like I was in a straight jacket. My first thought was "how can an Airline treat it's paying customers like this". I am 5'10" and could not sit with my legs together as they would bump into the seat in front of me. I didn't care about the lack of food or entertainment because it was a short flight. I would be concerned about Deep Vein Thrombosis if I was on a longer flight. I will never fly Air Canada Rouge again unless it is in the Premium section.

Flew Rouge from YVR to LAX. Unfriendly cabin crew cramped seats and horrible service staff made this the worst experience I've had flying in a long time. I've heard of road rage but this almost gave me the first case of flight rage. Avoid them at all costs don't even think about them for transatlantic or flights >3 hours.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My husband and I flew A/C Rouge from Toronto to Dublin on Oct 7 and from Dublin to Toronto Oct. 20. We were pleasantly surprised. We had heard that there was little leg room no screens and no meal. But we found the seating room was fine. We took our iPads so that was fine. We had a meal on the way over and a meal and snack on the way back. The crew was pleasant as well. Our only complaint is that people are allowed too much carry on. We had no room when we got on so the attendant took my carry on to the other side of the plane. I wish that could be more strictly regulated. Otherwise the flight was very good.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
September 30 2014 I flew home to Canada from Athens. It was an 11-hour flight and it was the worst flight I have flown. I did not know about Rouge. My flights were booked by an agent and I was not warned about the details of this economy-class flight. I did not know that there was no on-board entertainment and that I would have to rent an I-pad or that the seats were cramped and that I would have to pay for any alcoholic beverages. I am used to flying transatlantic on a regular Air Canada flight to Heathrow or to Frankfurt and those flights have been comfortable and enjoyable. This flight from Athens was a nightmare crowded with uncooperative passengers who insisted on standing in the aisles visiting with their friends and refusing to sit down when asked to do so when we hit turbulence. The staff did their best - they had my sympathy. I will continue to fly Air Canada but never Rouge again. When I can I will fly transatlantic on European carriers out of Montreal (Air France or KLM). WestJet has my vote for trans-Canada travel. I am disappointed with Air Canada and with my travel agent as well. I don't know that this flight was any cheaper and I would have liked to have been warned about what to expect and given the chance to say an emphatic no.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
On boarding a flight from Tampa I was shocked to find that what this airline calls business class consists of placing you in an economy sized seat with standard leg room. The only extra feature was that an empty seat was left between A and C. I fly business class largely to acquire a larger and more comfortable seat. With Rouge you pay for business class seats but you do not get them. Further you are not warned of this when you book your flight. The information provided indicates no difference between Rouge business class seats and regular business class seats. This is a deceptive practice and Air Canada should be required to post proper information on this matter. In any case I will never consider using Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We recently flew Toronto to Dublin booked through RBC rewards. I have flown AC for 30+ years. This was my first and last Rouge flight. I received a meal as a diabetic my wife didn't get any food at all on a 6 hour flight. Fortunately we hit a Tim Horton's a leaving Toronto. I hadn't informed myself of the no entertainment options or I would have brought my iPad. Food service for my wife was a dry bagel and water. Not the best start to a dream vacation. If my return portion of the flight was on Rouge I would just have stayed in Europe. Fortunately it was on Lufthansa with decent entertainment options and two meals free wine and snacks. Never again as many reviewers have said.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I was very disappointed in my latest flight on Air Canada Rouge from Dublin to Toronto on October 6 2014. The plane had no reading lights for the entire flight. Also the seat I sat in was very cold as cold air blew over it for the entire flight. The problem seemed to affect only 2 or 3 rows so no adjustment could be made. The attendants brought several people an extra blanket but they ran out so I did not even have that comfort. It was an extremely uncomfortable flight for over 7 hours. I will do my best to avoid Air Canada Rouge flights in the future.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
This was my first time with this airline and I flew LAX to Vancouver. The seats were shockingly tight both in width and in distance from the seat in front. The person in front of me reclined and my face was inches from the back of their seat. I didn't recline because I thought it would be incredibly rude to the person behind me since I already could feel their knees in my back. I couldn't cross my legs the entire trip. After 2+ hours this experience could easily become unbearable. I see air rage in their future. Luckily for me no one sat in the middle seat so the passenger in the aisle and I used that seat to lower the tray and it helped our spill over since the width is so narrow. I am 5'5 and 130 lbs. The space was too small for me! I travel frequently for work. This will be the first time I will complain about an airline and the first time I refuse to travel on an airline. I heard the company was able to jam an extra 11 rows through this configuration. Shame on them.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada 1865 MCO-YYZ May 4 2014. Avoid Air Canada Rouge like the plague. The seats are so cramped that at 5'7" I cannot sit without cramping up my legs. There is no entertainment unless you pay exorbitant rental fees. No room for your computer. No food. The person next to you must place their elbows in your face because they have no room either. Being ScRouged is the worst airline experience ever.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew Toronto-Phoenix and I'm still regretting it. Not only the price wasn't competitive (around CAD 800) it was the least comfortable flight I've taken in the past 5 years (and I travel roughly once a month). There is no legroom no inflight entertainment no snacks. You have to bring your own device to entertain yourself but on a 5 hour flight that is impossible given that they don't even provide power to recharge your laptop. The options available aren't good either. TV show reruns and movie classics. Nothing you haven't watched at home on a Sunday. This airline proves we'll end up being stacked on top of each other like boxes during flights soon so they can increase their revenue.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I recently travelled with my husband on Air Canada Rouge and was not pleased by the experience. My husband is 6'2 and his knees hit the seat in front of him and that was before the lady in front reclined! She should be allowed to recline as that's the type of seats that the airline claims to be selling but it shouldn't have been at the price of the person sitting behind her. If you didn't recline seats were very rigid and uncomfortable. Staff were ok but that was the only decent thing about the flight. Unfortunately this airline apparently tries to save weight by choosing not to stock their food and drink selection so the flight attendants weren't actually able to meet most peoples request. People were very frustrated by the cramped space limited food and overall crummy flight and some took it out on the flight attendants. This airline obviously cares as little about their employees as their customers since they choose to put their flight attendants in these situations. We called ahead of time to try and switch airlines since we originally booked with Air Canada's regular airline and wanted what we had initially booked. The lady on the phone assured us that the reviews on here were false and the Rouge service was the same as their regular service. Absolutely not true and I do not intend to fly with Air Canada Rouge ever again if I can help it.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Abysmal. Where do I start? 1) This is their "Luxury Class" airline? I'd like to see their definition of "luxury" because while mine might include massages and such having my backside massaged for five hours by the knees of the tall guy in the seat behind mine (through the cheap seat) isn't what I had in mind. 2) Service? For one they don't actually have much service other than basic drinks and bad food (must be purchased). The flight attendants are really young. The outbound crew spent most of the time in the back bitching about their schedulers and how horrid it is to work for the airline. 3) Comfort? I'm short. Just shy of 5'2". I've been on amusement park rides that lock me in less securely than I was on my "rouge" flights. Seriously. When the person in front of my reclined I was locked in for hours and didn't even have access to my items on the floor in front of me. 4) Flight options? Surprise! The only non-stop flight to my destination was on rouge. Cheap seats for an expensive flight. (Even more expensive because I was using a previously unused ticket that first required a 90 min wait to even talk to an AC rep and then required a $235 surcharge to change and included a loss of several hundred $ that I think could have been used towards Business Class for at least one direction.) Worse customer service ever. In short never again. This is a hypocritical "hip" new service that is best avoided at all cost. What an embarrassment. I will avoid Air Canada - and Air Canada rouge - at all costs.

I initially booked an Air Canada flight (LAX-YVR return) but after a while I was told by e-mail that my itinerary had been changed to Air Canada Rouge. Fortunately the timing of the flights was similar to those I booked. The flight was OK but the seating was too tight (and I am not a tall person).

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Round-trip Montreal-Rome in Premium Rouge on the B767 on one of the 2 non refurbished B767 with only 3 rows (instead of 4) - older seats but more legroom. Very satisfied with trip overall - lots of legroom food was good got some sleep in the recliner style seat service was good overall - just some minor issues / inconsistencies that you don't see on mainline. The leg rest and footrest were useless for me because I am tall. The big pillow added the lumbar support. Great value for price paid. Of course not a flatbed like business class but also not the same price! So for me I would not hesitate to take again premium rouge on the B767. I would also strongly consider trying the premium economy section on mainline 787 and 777HD after my experience on rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We recently flew to Athens from Toronto through Air Canada Vacations. Although the planes were new both going and coming home and the staff were friendly and professional we have never been more uncomfortable on a plane. The flight home was full and our seats were in the last row of the middle section with the bathrooms behind so we couldn't even recline our seats (the extra 4 inches). We are both tall and it was an agonizing 10 1/2 hour flight. I believe Rouge would be okay for short domestic flights but not the long flight we had to Athens.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada rouge got it right when they claimed that "You've never flown leisure like this before. b What an unbelievably horrible - and expensive - travel experience. Air Canada's attempt to save money is clearly "charge the same high fare for bare-bones travel". In short there's not much more that I can say that hasn't already been said but here it goes: - Cheaply made and poorly designed seats that are so tightly packed together that anyone taller than 4'8" is going to be uncomfortable. - Brand new flight attendants who bad-mouth their employer in the back of the cabin in front of customers. - Surly customer service reps at the airports - obviously dealing with the stress of unhappy customers. - Bare-bones service overall.I flew non-stop from Toronto to San Diego and this was my first and will be my last trip ever on rouge. It may also be my last trip on Air Canada. Absolutely abysmal.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have Florida flight passes. I don't think I will purchase again. Rouge is terrible. I would rather pay a little more and fly Air Canada. Like most frequent travellers think Rouge is terrible and Air Canada should admit it was a terrible idea. The branding is terrible as are the attendant's outfits the food is bad the premium seats are uncomfortable. I can't imagine flying coach. The entertainment is a good idea if you offer premium movies and wifi to all.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have flown rouge 2 times once to Nassau and once to Sarasota. I am 6 foot 1 and cannot sit in a normal position in the seats. I have to sit down into the seat and then twist my knees either to the left or right. That is the only position that I am able to sit in during the flight and that is assuming the person in front of me does not recline the seat. If that happens yours knees will be crushed. For short haul flights like these (3hrs) you can suck it up for a great price unfortunately I have been flying these routes for years and the fares are exactly the same as they were regular with Air Canada mainline. This is a scam and they are making an enormous amount of money off passengers like us that have decided to pay the same fares yet give up comfort entertainment and sanity! The thing is that this will not last over time more and more passengers will see what rouge has to offer and avoid it at all costs.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew from Montreal to Athens. The plane was very new and clean I had one of the most relaxing trips because the plane was empty if all the seats were taken I am sure my experience will be very different. The staff were not bad but after dinner no one saw them until breakfast. I found the cabin air very dry and the staff not once offered water or any other liquid. If the plane was not as full maybe I will fly them again. My trip satisfaction rate is high because the plane was empty and I had three seats to myself.

Seats are narrow and hard .If you are taller than 5ft 8 then your knees will be jammed into the row in front of you. Unreal and no entertainment TV nothing on a 5-6 hour flight. Class act have been flying AC for 29 years and never knew rouge was 3rd rate flight at best. Avoid at all costs.

Had my first experience with Air Canada Rouge and will never use it again. It was by far the worst flight experience I have ever had. The cabin was extremely cramped and my knees were stuck in the back of the passenger in front of me for the entire flight. The check in girl was no treat either. It is a new low for Air Canada.

We recently took an Air Canada Rouge flight from Edinburgh to Toronto . We had read many negative reviews but decided to try Rouge because it was a direct flight. For the most part we were pleasantly surprised. We found the flight attendants to be very efficient and professional. As far as the seats and configuration we agree with others that it is pretty crowded and there is not much legroom. The rented iPad worked well for the inflight entertainment system. While our overall experience was positive we think that there should be a far greater fare difference for Rouge flights compared to regular Air Canada service. If this is to be a discount airline the fares should reflect this. Because of this we would prefer to use full service carriers.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Traveled to Las Vegas last week on Rouge for the 1st and last time. I am 6' tall and do not fit in the seat as my knees were pushing into the back of the passenger ahead of me. This passenger seated in the seat ahead of me was upset at the fact my knees were in her back but after getting up and looking at my predicament was understanding of the situation. The flight I was on was full of people partying. Instead of trying to subdue the rowdiness the Rouge flight attendants were joining the party. I finally looked at the attendant and asked her to keep her voice down and it would be nice if she would ask the other passengers to do the same. She looked at me as if I was doing something wrong. I was sitting on the aisle my companion next to me in the middle and a young man in the window seat who never actually sat in his seat but instead on the arm rest facing us with his feet on the seat and yelling loudly to all his friends sitting around us. The Rouge staff never once asked him to calm down and actually were laughing and joking with him and his friends. FYI this was a night flight which normally would have been a flight where catching a nap for a few hours would have been normal. It was so loud I could not hear the movie I was watching with my head phones. In future I will never fly Rouge again. I would rather take a different airline with a stop over than this direct flight again! Extremely disappointing!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I travel extensively. I am gold/platinum on both United and Delta. Recently moved back to Canada after living in US for 3.5 years. Have been dismayed by Air Canada both by the high prices and poor service. But the worst is AC Rouge. Just travelled 2 trips one to Las Vegas and the other to Orlando. The first was in "premium" class the other in economy. Both have been among my worst flights in each category. Even surprised regulations allow such cramped seats in economy. I will do everything to avoid Rouge in the future even if it means making a connection as opposed to a direct flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew Manchester - Toronto then onto Charlotte plane was late arriving Toronto and missed connection. I was told I would have to fly to Baltimore to get connection next morning. By the time I got to the hotel I had been travelling 23 hrs since leaving home. My luggage did not arrive in Baltimore despite being told it would be there when I arrived. I rang air Canada luggage services from Baltimore and was told there was no record of my luggage tag on their system and it should be in Charlotte when I arrive it was not by chance I was in the airport to meet a customer the following day and it was being pushed on a trolley so could claim it. I know these things happen but it is the total lack of any care or response from Air Canada that is my gripe. Premier seats were good both ways food was ok ipad idea does not work where do you put them when drinks /food arrives maybe Velcro on back of seat would help so it can be suspended and does not need to be held.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We usually fly to Vegas via Montreal. We live in Ottawa and there are very few direct flights. This time we went via Toronto to Vegas. We flew Rouge. What a disappointment! The planes are old. There is no PTV and if you do rent an iPad the movies featured are old. The overhead luggage compartment was full so some people were asked to check their luggage because it would not fit. Luckily we had booked seats in front so we had good leg room. The flight attendants were very attentive but you could tell they lacked the experience of the veteran flight attendants. When we returned from Toronto to Ottawa we flew a regular Air Canada flight and you could tell the difference. What has happened to Air Canada?

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew Rouge from Toronto to Venice because it was a direct flight. The outbound plane was older and the seats are definitely too small and too close together. God help you if you had someone in front of you that wanted to recline! The crew however were young and more friendly than most we've had in a long time. Seemed to be more flight attendants also. Our return trip was on a newer plane and the crew were again very friendly and helpful but the seating was the same. People need more room!. We were aware of the inflight entertainment option with iPads but were surprised at the few old movie choices and offerings. These flights were too long to have such limited entertainment. I'm glad that AC has changed its mind about Rouge to Barbados.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
San Diego on September 30 2014 and returned to Toronto on October 6th. On the positive side the flight left on time and the crew was pleasant and tried to accommodate passenger requests. We sat in row 25 and by the time the crew made it to that row much of the food selection was sold out however the crew offered the few items left in the carts and were very accommodating. My key issue is seating space. I am 6 foot 1 inch tall and thin. As you can imagine getting into those Rouge seats was an issue and sitting in that cramp space for over 5 hours proved to be very uncomfortable. They really need to put a “warning” on the booking site to say that “Rouge seats will not accommodate passengers over 6 feet tall”. Sorry to say but this will be our last Rouge flight and I will be sure to let family friends and acquaintances know how tight the seating is and to avoid at all cost. I just can’t imagine surviving a trip overseas.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada Rouge is to be avoided. There is no leg room the depth of the seat is short and seats are small in width. Staff are nice but hardly compensates for the discomfort. This is Air Canada's discount option but my fare was not discounted. Avoid!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Stay away from Rouge. Nothing but discomfort and aggravation. Flew back from Vegas on Oct 6th the plane was full. No body room or leg room. If the passenger behind you puts something in the seat pocket you felt it. Your knees touch the seat in front of you. No inflight entertainment only with an iPad and they rent them for $10.00. I will not fly them again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Travelled Toronto to Athens and return on this cut-rate airline that has cut everything but the rates. Staff members on both flights with one exception were disengaged disinterested and at times downright rude to passengers. I am determined never to travel Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Very cramped space. No leg room unless you upgrade your seat or are in an exit row. The seats are narrow and uncomfortable. I would never recommend rouge. If the flights were really cheap I would understand that these are trade-offs. The only saving grace is that the flight attendants were very friendly and professional.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I am a regular AC traveller Vancouver to wherever x 25 years. I had my first Rouge experience this week to Dublin and was shocked and disgusted with all aspects of the flight. Staff seem to have been selected from Tim Hortons lineup and given camp counsellor training. With an average age of 21 I would not trust them to lead me out of my house much less off an airplane. Food inedible seats hard and tight and what an insult to not be told that there was no entertainment system onboard and a charge for a glass of wine. When I complained I was told that AC always charges for wine which is not the case on the regular long haul flights. Take offence when extra charges are sprung on me (iPad). I paid same as I would have for route through Heathrow: never again a Rouge flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I had my first and hopefully last Air Rouge trip - one way from Nassau. I'm a petite woman and I have never been so uncomfortable in a plane in spite of having an aisle seat. While it was slightly tolerable for the 3 hour flight I see that Rouge is also flying long-distance routes to places in Europe. I can't imagine being in those kind of cramped quarters for an extended flight of 8 or 9 hours. I'll fly WestJet on the Nassau route next time or an American flight through Miami. The entertainment choices were extremely limited on the iPad. I would have been happy to use aeroplan points and book the equivalent of business on Rouge but the seats are not available to Aeroplan. I called the redemption center to ask for an explanation about the Rouge flights and I was told by the customer service agent that they get many complaints about Rouge all the time. Air Canada needs to seriously reconsider their services and the routes they put these planes on.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked my flight to Phoenix with the aircraft showing as a 320 only to discover when I received an itinerary change notification the equipment would be a rouge 319. My first flight with Rouge what a dreadful experience - old aircraft no leg room even if you 'rent' an ipad the entertainment options are dismal and no discount in the price. Having been a loyal supporter of Air Canada for many years with Super Elite/Elite status and having flown over 1-million miles I was extremely disappointed with the 'standard' that Air Canada is now offering under this brand for future travel I will certainly we looking for other options when travelling to any destinations being serviced by Air Canada rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Worst flight ever. No seat room no leg room cramped and uncomfortable. When the people behind use the seat pockets you feel it if the passenger in front of you reclines its a disaster. The plane was full AC has added about 25 additional seats to the A319 and made everyone uncomfortable. Rough landing at Toronto airport although the flight was early. I have yet to meet someone who claims rouge to be adequate. Stay away I will never fly rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Having booked an Air Canada flight without regard to the specifics of AC Rouge I quickly learned Air Canada "rouge" is basically charter airline discomfort at Air Canada standard airfares. Being 6'0" tall the 29" economy seat pitch was outright miserable. My knees pressed against the seat in front of me even with proper upright seating posture. Sleeping on the red-eye return from Las Vegas to Montreal was near impossible due to cramped seating environment. The rest of the flight was uneventful-on time food for purchase and luggage made it undamaged. No in-flight entertainment TV's. Overall in my opinion Air Canada should segregate Rouge flight options from its standard ticketing engine and sell it separately as discount charter flights because Rouge is on par with Sunwing Air Transat and Thomas Cook. Its bare bone cattle class discount service is in a league well below Air Canada's normally high standards.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
After reading many reviews I was very apprehensive about our flight from Toronto to Montego Bay. The flights were on time and we found the staff young but professional. Maybe because we're not tall people we had enough leg room and didn't feel cramped. We also found the flights to be nice and quiet without the carts going up and down the aisle every little while. We ate before we got onboard and had snacks with us so that wasn't an issue. Would fly Air Canada Rouge again if the occasion presented itself.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
You feel like your riding in a yellow school bus but with much less legroom. High seat backs I'm 6' and my knees were pushed into the back of the seat in front of me. Flew from Toronto to San Diego for 5 hrs in beyond cramp conditions. There should be a law preventing such cruelty - the airfare wasn't any cheaper than non Rouge flights i.e. United American etc (you just don't see it's Rouge when you book AC).

I flew YYZ to PHX. Terrible flight. No leg room no entertainment no electrical outlets but the same price as before. I will fly any other option than AC Rouge from now on. I have been super elite on Air Canada for years and I feel somewhat betrayed. I flew BA to London last week because I'm so angry.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew Rouge from Toronto to Phoenix despite the reviews. The reviews are correct. The biggest issue is the seat size. This is a good airline for children as they have enough legroom. For half the flight I stood in the galley because it hurt too much to sit in a 29 inch seat for 5 hours. There is also a problem with the inflight entertainment as it offers very little if you use an Apple product. Hopefully another carrier will provide some competition.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YYZ-EDI 2 Oct 2014. Booked in Premium rouge this being the fourth sampling of Rouge since they started operations in July 2013. I have read other reports on this forum about the negative comments about AC rouge therefore there was an element of concern of what to expect! Premium rouge permits priority boarding at YYZ this was done efficiently. On boarding the aircraft it was clean and tidy with water and menus placed on the seat arms/dividers. The crew were young and friendly they are not however as professional in service presentation as those on AC mainline. The safety announcements were fine as they should be. The leg room in premium rouge is similar to that provided on AC mainline Executive class. I am 6’+ and I was comfortable for the overnight flight of 6hours +. A choice of chicken or a non-meat dish was provided for dinner with drinks included for the fare paid. Hot towels and linen for the tray tables are provided prior to the first meal service. Meal orders were taken shortly after departure along with offers of complimentary I pads for IFE. I did not bother with the I pad as I wanted to sleep after the dinner service which I managed to do for around 2 hours. About 1.5 hours before landing at EDI a small continental breakfast was serviced. The flight landed at EDI on time and with a carry-on bag I was though the airport in around 15 minutes after landing. Having experienced 2 AC mainline flights in Executive class immediately prior to this rouge flight the rouge service stood up fairly well hopefully the professionalism to service will follow with age. I am already considering AC rouge for future trips to North America the real down side is that at present the EDI/YYZ service is only available mid June through early October.

Toronto to Greece with no in house entertainment is not a good thing. You can download entertainment app if you have iphone ipad and they start at the front of the plane with limited ipad rentals. I am short but noticed the seats smaller and my husband definitely did. Flight crew great. We always fly AC but looking at flights to Barcelona and will not fly there with AC because Air Rouge is only option.

Travelled to Las Vegas from Toronto. Paid the extra money for premium economy as it was a long flight. Luckily we got the row right behind business class and it felt a little roomier for the legs. Think we were luckier than the rest in premium economy for this reason only. God forbid if you had to go to the bathroom because you had to make your way down the narrow aisle to the back of the plane loaded with people waiting to use the bathroom. There is barely enough room to pass other people going the opposite direction. But people persist by squeezing past you nevertheless. We ordered 3 pizza slices and falafel wrap. The pizza was the worst. Paper thin. Nothing like the picture in the menu. Ate it because we weren't prepared with snacks of our own. I did find that the staff tried their best in these less than ideal conditions. They must have to deal with a lot of grumpy people on these flights. I guess a lot of people on the flight were up and about in plane as to avoid blood clots in legs. I was very thankful to finally leave the plane at our destination. I will seriously reconsider Air Canada Rouge for future flights.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew executive from Vancouver to Nassau on Air Canada (YVR to YYZ) then Rouge (YYZ to NAS). The Air Canada portion in a pod was 9 out of 10 as the food wasnt great. I braced myself for the downgrade partly from some seriously bad reviews on this website. I was pleasantly surprised to find the seats we not bad food the same as Air Canada and the flight crew great. I thought Rouge was ok after all. Then came the return flight. We got to the airport only to find the flight had been cancelled and new flight would be 2 hours late. Then three then four and here's where things went downhill. I was now not going to make my connection in Toronto back to Vancouver. I was advised by a lady who barely looked up that I was now booked on a red eye out of Toronto. I said I wouldn't fly an overnight flight and could I please book the first flight out in the morning. She said no at first but then came back and said I would have to fly coach - I said no as I had an executive ticket. She said it's an aeroplan booking and added if you had a paid for an Air Canada ticket she may have been able to help me. Flew to YYZ - went right to Air Canada relations. They listened and gave a sincere apology for my treatment in Nassau. They ask me when I wanted to leave and although they were unable to give me complimentary hotel stay in they did offer to get me a special rate. Flight home on Air Canada B777 perfect breakfast was the best pancakes ever. Overall Rouge not so bad but their handlers in Nassau were rude and disrespectful. Would I fly Rouge again? Probably but wish Air Canada would take back the route.

We flew back to Toronto from Barcelona anticipating another good Rouge flight as was the outbound. The equipage was different and while the room (premium) was about the same there was no outlet to plug into and the service was much less. As other reviewers have written- the staff spent a majority of their time behind their curtain in the forward cabin. They did their jobs- served towels food and liquor but otherwise you didn't see them very much. The buttons to recline the seat or put up the leg rest were very beaten up (I.e. Old) levers. Some seats worked - mine did not. So I would say your trip is really dictated by: A) the age of the plane and B) the hospitality factor of the attendants. One point in the attendants' favour is that they ran out of chicken on the flt back and switched crew meals to accommodate our choice. Guess Rouge needs more chicken for all the people coming home after a cruise as we start our diets! P.S. I borrowed one of their iPads as my mini kept cutting out on the first flight. Worked just fine and has a much bigger screen.

Montreal to Rome Aug. 16 and Lisbon to Toronto September 14. Staff okay they were pretty nice on the way to Rome cheerfully indifferent from Lisbon to Toronto. Having to pay for an iPad and lack of Android app is not good. Seat pitch and lack of legroom horrid. Food was mixed: their main courses were totally inedible but wrap snack was okay. Not enough room on the overhead bins where everything was squished actually not enough room anywhere. Seriously total strangers were bonding over how cramped we all were. It's inhumane really. And what was worse is that I paid regular AC prices! I don't know where those passengers who bought cheaper got their tickets but I can tell you I've been rouged for the last time! I read that the AC CEO says that the problem is that passengers have to "adjust their expectations. I hope he'll soon need to adjust his. It was a horrid experience and never again.

Rouge 1898 & 1899 YVR-LAS and back. The only good thing about this experience was the fact that I was sitting in "Premium Rouge" and had some semblance of leg room on the A319 aircraft. I felt bad for the people in the back cramped in like sardines. Ridiculous that they charge virtually the same as mainline flights for much less. Also ridiculous is that Rouge requires the same number of eUpgrades as mainline for a lot less in the J cabin. Flight attendants were more interested in chatting amongst themselves and their friends onboard than looking after the rest of the passengers and they do not exude any confidence whatsoever. I highly recommend people avoid Rouge if at all possible!

You don't even get a cracker with your drink and the seats are narrow if you are over 5'6" or larger than a size M you will feel squished in your seat. No screens or power sources so if you don't carry an Apple product they will "rent you one for a mere $10". At the very least when you book a flight on AC Rouge a window should pop up that advises you of these changes. No one likes a surprise and I didn't speak with one happy passenger. Needless to say the next flights we had booked we've gone ahead and upgraded to their Premium Seats so Air Canada accomplished their goal - they got us to spend more. Westjet is looking pretty good right now.

Like many others I feel that I was abused maybe even cheated. I am a senior citizen normally a trusting soul. Buyer beware. I booked an AC flight to Lisbon and found that I was sent off on this substandard flight - never again. Thankfully the return flights were Lufthansa. What a difference. Worst to best. I am very unhappy with every aspect of the quality of this carrier. Others have already made similar comments - there seems no need to elaborate. Mostly I am unhappy at unwittingly being routed on this flight. Hopefully adding my name to the list of numerous other dissatisfied customers will prevent others from making this mistake. A mistake I will not repeat. Lufthansa or any other airline would be my future choice. As a Canadian I could tolerate the normal AC second rate service this has been more than anyone should be willing to accept.

I've had two flights with rouge. Never again. I was forced to use rouge with flight passes from Tampa and I will not purchase Air Canada flight passes again. Both times flights were late. The latest a flight from Kingston Jamaica scheduled to leave at 2 pm left after 8 pm. There is no business class food is terrible as is entertainment. Why not perfect your brand and let others fly Westjet or Transat - stop competing in this cheap flight service market. Hate to say it but I am going with American Airlines until Porter offers longer flights.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew many times before on the YUL-LAS one way flight in economy and since they changed to Rouge just before this trip back in April 2014 I thought it was probably to satisfy a high demand for one way flights to LAS thus explaining the switch to a bigger plane. However simply converting an old 767 plane into a "low cost carrier" for which the price was still the same as the previous 737 plane I just can't say it was worth the upgrade to business class. OK the seats are fine and so was the space but to take away the personal in flight screen and all of the electrical outlets to be replaced with wifi and BYO Device? I wonder how many people got enough battery for 5 hours. Even though the tablet was included in business class oh my lord the lack of entertainment choices! There was virtually nothing! As much as the food rather disappointing but ok. My mimosa didn't have any alcohol and breakfast was as good as any economy food. Nice try AC to pass off a new low cost carrier by simply keeping all of the profits. Good thing people take notice into the type of aircraft they're paying for.

I travel South from Canada twice a year. I always favored Air Canada for comfort Entertainment and the service. It bugged me a little when we had to pay for our meals but it wasn't so bad. It was an excellent price-quality ratio. Last week I've travelled Rouge. The staff were nice but the rest was disappointing. I've travelled Air Cubana once and I feel it was comparable to Rouge. The leg room is terrible and the entertainment system is worst than awful offering old movies at a high cost (10$ to rent the iPad and 5$ to access the movies). Rouge doesn't compare well to other budget airlines. Moreover we've lost our best airline to the South.

Booked a flight from Las Vegas to Quebec leaving at 11.30 pm arriving at 9.52 am. First leg was on Air Canada Rouge and the second was a turboprop plane. A week later double checked my reservation and found out that first flight had been cancelled and was booked on another Air Canada rouge. However this time I was leaving at 12.15 pm arriving in Montreal and then had a 13 hour layover. I called Air Canada and asked if I was being put up in a hotel room for the night in Montreal. No was the answer. The agent really did not care at all. After much discussion I cancelled the reservation and asked for a confirmation email that I would get a full refund. Agent stated that it would not be a problem. When asking how long it will take for the refund he replied "Up to 3 weeks". 24 hours later I never did receive the email but the reservation had been cancelled. My suggestion is do not fly this airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have flown for over 20 years with Air Canada. However for the first time ever I had a 4 hour flight from Phoenix to Toronto and I have never stepped foot into a plane that had such little leg room! I am 6'5" tall and I could not put both of my legs behind the seat in front of me. I was also surrounded by other men who were all over 6' tall and they all suffered from this. I will continue to fly Air Canada but only if it is not an AC Rouge flight. Unless AC changes their seat layout I will start flying DELTA or American to the cities that Rouge flies to.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked on "Air Canada" at a rather high cost from Montreal to San Diego. Discovered that "Rouge" was the carrier from Toronto onwards. Plane small hot crowded all the usual complaints flyers have these days. Not even a bag of peanuts offered on a 4.5 hour flight free water offered hourly however. I have no objection personally to flying 'cattle class' when I have paid accordingly. This is outright highway robbery at over $300. one way on what I thought was a 'legacy' carrier. The cabin was overheated with no apparent way to improve the temperature or comfort level. Two lavs at rear of cabin appeared insufficient given the projected passenger load. The staff appeared eager but inept in so many ways. I felt as though I was being attended to by the local fast food restaurant hostess: eager chirpy but ill equipped for a real job. As is the current custom constant nickel and diming along the way adds to flyer frustration fortunately I can forgo the proffered toys at $10. a pop but I do object to paying premium price on a cheap-0 carrier. Never again. (Date of Travel: Sept. 24th flight 1847 - Toronto to San Diego non-stop).

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew AC Rouge to Venice on Aug 23 having paid for the extra leg room seats. The flight was good and the extra leg room was great. Having read many reviews complaining about the cramped seats. It would be nice if the cost of the extra leg room seats included a few extra perks (like priority boarding and/or free drinks) as $90 for a one way is a bit steep. The flight was good excellent service. I was surprised that a flight to Italy did not have any announcements in Italian. The in-flight entertainment was OK on our iPhone and iPad. Although not "advertised" the USB plug on the arm rest came in handy for keeping our devices charged. There is also plug to be shared between the two seats by the window. Movie choices were OK but not as good as the mainline aircraft. I also really missed the flight data and maps that are available on most airlines.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Pro: Flight from Toronto (Canada) to Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) and back safely and on time. Cons: No entertainment (ex. movies) on board unless you have ipad iPhone or Windows laptop. You can rent an iPad on the plane for 10$. Movies not compatible on Android systems. You had to pay for your food. Some beverages such as water juice was provided for free though. No space between the economy seats. If your 6 foot and taller unless your seated near the alley way its very uncomfortable especially when the persons in front of you reclines their seat. The only reason we went with them is because we saved 25% on our trip with our Airmiles. Don't get SCRouged by this airline if possible choose another airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Montego Bay and return. Seats were cramped (I am 5'4" and my knees touched the seat in front of me) no entertainment unless you bring an iPad service was minimal and no duty free offered on the return flight. This is definitely a no frills airline but you are paying full Air Canada price. Would never book with Air Canada Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Excellent Flight and service. We travelled Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Barcelona on 17 Sep 2014 and returned 28 Sep 2014. We originally had premium seating both ways but we changed our arrival date and had to settle for economy. Prior to leaving I read these reviews and was mortified and dreading our flight for 8.5 hours. We boarded the plane it was clean new and right off the bat the staff were wonderful. Many reviews complain about the age of the staff? Why? They are extensively trained and I would rather travel with this crew than the stuffy old sky bags on other Air Canada flights. The leg room was perfectly fine in economy. I am 5'11" and 210 lbs. not a small lad and I was comfortable the entire way. As for air circulation that is normally an issue on regular flights as you are always adjusting the flow and on overnight flights there is a tendency to lower the pressure of air flow and turn up the temperature to make folks sleep. Not on this flight. The air flow was good you could feel it and it remained a comfortable constant. Meals were provided which normally are not. Drinks were available as usual. As for the inflight entertainment the IPad thing was perfectly fine tons of options. We did not know about this but if you read your itinerary email it tells you. Also you can rent one of theirs for a small fee. Our return portion had us seated in the premium seating just a little expense more and again more leg room but really it was perfectly fine. Better than United Air which I will never fly again. This flight was great we were comfortable. It is a budget flight as advertised and we would do it again. For those complaining we have flown around the world both on economy and first class and this flight was fine. I think they are complaining because that's what they like to do. Did not hear a single complaint from anyone on the entire flight. Air Canada Rouge is a hit. Thanks again to the wonderful flight staff for a great flight.

SFO-YVR rerouted off cancelled United flight as I have been avoiding AC Rouge on all of the Western Canada to California routes since they converted from mainline - I just can not do 29 inch pitch. On this A319 flight I used Altitude upgrades to Premium Rouge which is 6 across with middle seats blocked. Unfortunately I was assigned 1A which has 2 problems: (1) It is a bulkhead seat with less than 20 inches of room between the seat legs and the bulkhead and (2) front row means tray tables stowed in the armrest so even though the middle seat was blocked I was confined tightly into the seat. Onboard service was pleasant with the new crews and the meal that was offered with a menu and choice of entrees was good standard Air Canada domestic J quality. Unfortunately due to the reduced personal space and legroom I will continue to make a point of avoiding Rouge where I am able to select another carrier. Glad to see DL is ramping up some more YYC service this fall giving more options to California.

Just returned from Dublin on Air Canada Rouge - not a good trip. Unfortunately the flight was delayed in Toronto by 3 hours. No communication from ground staff in departure lounge that could be heard. Boarding was confusing. Sat on tarmac another hour plus I am elderly and needed to use the toilet that was not allowed. Flight attendants were not warm and friendly we did not feel welcome. The meal was ok but my pop was warm as they did not offer ice. There was supposed to be a snack meal near the end of the flight but nothing was offered. Could not have coffee due to turbulence which for the whole trip was minimal. Kept seat belt sign on for most of flight making it difficult to use the toilet in fact my husband was told he could not. We have been flying many years and Air Canada is not our carrier of choice due to attitude of staff. We will not be flying Air Canada again unless we have no other choice.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I recently flew ATH-YYZ on Rouge. It was much better than I expected - but I think that was probably mostly because I was in Premium Economy. The regular seating section really looked cramped and passengers there did not look happy. The good: great flight crew. Yes they are young and yes they wear funny outfits (the hats are ridiculous!). But they were all really friendly helpful and attentive and I saw no evidence of lack of knowledge. The seat was very comfortable - not business class but definitely much roomier than even 'normal' economy. On time take off and landing frequent drink service and decent food (for an airline). The bad: the Premium seats seem to be anchored by some mechanism that completely blocks the under-seat space. That meant there was no room for my shoulder bag - which I have successfully placed under seats in much smaller aircraft. As others have noted the iPad connection is not always reliable and I had to restart it a couple of times.

We came back on a Rouge flight yesterday from Venice to Toronto. We paid $2000 for our flight the outbound was AC to Munich-Sarajevo-Venice. All fine though hardly "world class". We had no idea we were booked on a Rouge flight home or what that meant. None of the pre-booked seats were available or honoured. We were put together my husband and I in row 48 but many people were separated. Then we learned there are no screens I don't carry a tablet so was told I could rent one for 10 Euros on a $2000 ticket! Lunch - no wine no drinks unless you paid $6.50. Lunch was nothing fresh no salad all starch no fruit no vegetables and dessert was a cookie. Then 2 hours later the snack - a cookie and 2 hours before landing a wrap. This was a 9.5 hour flight. Two hours before the flight arrived the bathroom had no toilet paper and was unclean. The poor lovely staff were dressed in ugly colours with fedoras looking like they stepped out of South American villages. Shame on Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have been a loyal Air Canada customer since moving to Canada. As someone who is traveling almost every week airline performance is important. Perhaps it's the perfect case scenario but for all the reasons that came to be I am left having paid full fare for a 5 hour flight from Toronto only to get to the plane to find everything I had come to expect missing. I'll give Air Canada credit as I was very much aware that this was a "operated by rouge" badging which was very predominantly displayed throughout the purchase process. At the time I paid no attention to it as the price I was paying was exactly the same as all previous tickets purchased to this destination (I travel at least once a year to this destination to attend conferences). There is no entertainment screens no USB power no power outlets cramped seating. All of which I may be perfectly ok with if it was it on its own. The fact that they are combined is making this unbearable. Do I have an iPad? Yes is it charged enough to use for 5 hours? Absolutely not. As a businessman I've been on my devices all day and look forward to a flight without having to look at work or its related devices. None of my devices including my phone I'm typing this on is on a position to be used for extended periods of time by the end of the day. This is ignoring the fact I like to land at destination with a full charge! I spent extra money for a business class seat on the return expecting to be on the red eye and landing at 7 am to drive straight to the office. Seeing what a "business class seat" looked like simply same as economy with an empty "for your convenience" empty seat in the middle is useless. I will not get to sleep properly unwind relax and be ready for a full day of business when I land. Instead I had to cancel some meetings and move my flight up to ensure that I can land with enough time to get a proper nights rest before my next day begins. Unfortunately I will be replacing all my flights in which Rouge operates and as soon as I identify an airline which can accommodate the destinations I require from YYZ I will be dropping Air Canada altogether.

I booked what I believed to be standard Air Canada flights YYZ to ATH (AC#1900) on Sept 10 and ATH to YYZ (AC #1901) on Sept 19. Unfortunately I learned what Rouge was never having heard of the concept and certainly not ever wanting to experience it again. The 767 aircraft was an absolute nightmare for lack of space entertainment and food or beverage. The first thing I noted was the lack of TV screens on seat backs-I asked the attendant what was going on and he explained that for weight concerns they'd removed them to save the cost of flying the AC planes. He also said that "everyone has an iPad these days" so they felt the decision was warranted. When it came time for meals I asked for wine and was told that it was available for purchase. The attendants were in their early 20s inexperienced and should have been made to practice the company talking points before being permitted to board the plane and interact with customers as their inability to provide acceptable rationale only made matters worse. Myself and my boyfriend are both tall and he suffered tremendous back and leg pain. It's not worth it to spend 10-11 hours on a plane with no entertainment or hospitality. All of the other carriers know what it is to travel internationally and will actually care for customers. Lose the fedoras and horrible shoes and spend some money on customer-focused resources.

We thought we were flying from Toronto to Dublin on a normal Air Canada flight and had not heard of Rouge until we arrived at the airport. We were there 4 hours before the flight checked in at the self service kiosk and were not allocated seats we were told this would be done at the gate. The gate did not open until about 30mins before departure we asked about seat allocation and were told by a rather officious member of staff to sit and wait until we were called so the flight is boarding and very late in the day we are called to be given our seats. There is some difficulty in finding 2 together for my wife and I but finally it happens we walk the short distance to the plane to find our seats already occupied by 2 members of a family group. After a lot of faffing around the cabin crew finally split the family up by giving 2 of them an upgrade to the comfortable seats upfront while we are left in he hard cramped nasty ones in the main cabin. Only then do we discover this stupid nonsense with the lack of inflight entertainment unless you have an ipad with you and have downloaded their app which of course we had not been aware of. Altogether an unpleasant flight experience doubly disappointing given Air Canada's supposed good reputation. I would not fly with them again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
What a mistake they have made with this change. Definitely a disappointing experience older aircraft no price break limited choice on non stop routes and poor entertainment options. We would have expected more from the Air Canada brand. Hopefully they will rethink this experiment and return to the standards we have come to expect from Air Canada.

I flew from Dublin to Vancouver with Air Canada on 12 August 2014. The first leg of the journey was with Air Canada Rouge to Toronto. The flight was delayed by 11 hours due to pilot problems. When we finally boarded we were greeted by very young and in all likelihood very inexperienced staff. The plane was old and very cramped. When we finally landed in Toronto  I then had a 6 hour wait to get my connecting flight to Vancouver. I thought that this was all just an unfortunate problem in the delay but lo and behold my daughter took the same Air Canada Rouge flight from Dublin three weeks later and was delayed taking off by 4 hours and missed her connecting flight. Less than one week after her flight I happened to be flying in from London Heathrow at 3pm and guess what the air Canada Rouge flight which was supposed to have taken off at 12.10 was still sitting in Dublin airport. I will never fly with Rouge again and I think Air Canada need to look at this whole off shoot airline. It is a complete disaster and I would suggest that the company review it before passengers vote with their feet and move completely to other carriers.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I wanted to believe that the reviews I read before my Rouge experience were exaggerated by picky pampered flyers. Sadly the reviews were accurate Air Canda Rouge is no bargain. I just flew 8 hours from Montreal to Rome on AC 1920 Sept 20 2014. 8 hours of uncomfortable seats that kept buckling inward so I felt my neighbors every move in their seat. When I asked for water it took them 40 minutes to bring me a cup with attitude since I used my attendant call button. On an 8 hour flight I only received two beverage services that were water and coffee. Lack of water is unhealthy on a flight this long. I actually paid 81 usd to upgrade my seat to a window seat. Worst decision - very cramped seat. Do yourself a favor switch to regular Air Canada. I have never written a poor review for an airline. Sadly they deserved this review. Oh and the inflight app stopped working every 10 minutes and the wifi only services the app. Sad service.

My husband and I were scheduled on Rouge flights from Ottawa to Las Vegas connecting through Toronto in September 2014. We purposefully selected the flight leaving from Ottawa at 06.00 (leaving the house at 04.30) to fly out of Toronto at 8.50 with the intent of arriving in Las Vegas early to get the most out of a five-day vacation. Instead of walking the Las Vegas strip we were stuck in the Toronto airport for an 11 hour delay - kind of hard to believe that Rouge could not find another plane to fly out of Toronto earlier. Guess what happened on the trip back - a nine hour wait at the Las Vegas airport again thanks to Rouge management. Both trip delays were not weather related. We wasted a complete day of vacation thanks to Rouge. We would have had little to say if the flight price was a discount but it certainly wasn't. We have truly been "rouged".

Flew out of Toronto yesterday 8.50 am flight to Vegas scheduled to arrive around 10.30 Vegas time. Took off a few minutes late and the flight was uneventful for the first 2.5 hours with the exception of the worst possible seats providing no comfort and space. Did have to ask the lady in front of me to keep her seatback straight to prevent injury to my knees. The pilot came on the intercom to tell us we have a "situation" whereby we lost our left engine and were diverting to Denver to get it checked. He assured us the 767 could fly safely on one engine and he did a good job getting us on the ground without incident at about 9.45 local time. Met by the firetrucks on the tarmac and they checked out the engine and determined it was ok to proceed to the gate. Got to sit on the plane for an extended period without air conditioning and little information forthcoming about our situation. We were finally told another plane would be dispatched from Toronto to pick us up and get on our way to Vegas at 5.30 local time. When we finally got off the plane they gave everyone $20 worth of meal vouchers and then the waiting began. Went to the gate in plenty of time as we had a lot of it to kill. There was no representative at the gate and when we checked the departure schedule discovered that our time had been delayed to 6.30. Suddenly the departure time changed to 7.30. How long does it take a 767 to get from Toronto to Denver even considering a new crew was needed? After changing gates we were told by an announcement that the plane was on the ground and would be at the gate by 6.30. Finally things were looking up. Started boarding about 7.00 and then we sat. The crew kept walking around the plane checking seats for some unknown reason while the passengers were getting restless and looking for answers as to why we were not leaving the gate. The pilot finally came on to tell us the plane needed rebalancing - I believe there were 6 people who made other arrangements and were not continuing on this flight. Finally left Denver after 8.00 and arrived in Vegas just before 9.30. Plane arrived in Terminal 1 and our bags were in Terminal 3. Again no information given by Air Canada staff so people basically had to figure out for themselves that you have to grab a shuttle bus for a 5 minute ride to Terminal 3 and then try and find the right carousel. Got to our hotel about 10.30 about 12 hours later than expected. Given the choice will not fly Air Canada in the future.

My husband and I flew Dublin to Toronto direct on 8 Sept and returned Sept 15 in the premium economy cabin the aircraft was a 767 both ways with a 2-2-2 seating configuration. We chose this airline mainly on price - approx £ £400 cheaper per ticket than British Airways or Virgin PE from London via I think New York. The first thing to say is that if you are expecting Business Class seating/facilities you will be disappointed. This was nothing like the BC we have used on Emirates and Turkish Airlines. However as a premium economy offering at an exceptionally good price we were very pleasantly surprised - in fact we could not fault it. I would judge it not quite as good as Virgin PE but certainly equal to if not better than British Airways PE. We were able to use the priority lanes for both check in and security clearance on both legs the aircraft was clean and comfortable the cabin crew were all extremely pleasant helpful presentable and very professional (other reviewers have complained that the crew are young and inexperienced; they were certainly young but we could not fault the service they provided throughout). In fact I much preferred the Canada Rouge crews with their positive can-do attitude to the 'Can I really be bothered? stand-offish attitude I have experienced more than once on British Airways. We had no problems at all with the tablets issued to us for entertainment an issue that some reviewers have been unhappy with. The food choices were not extensive but certainly sufficient of good quality and presented nicely. Drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic were good quality and frequently offered. I would say well done Canada Rouge - in our experience you have an excellent value for money product at least in the PE cabin. We will certainly use again for transatlantic flights.

Well Air Canada was my preferred flight until I took a flight with AC Rouge to Vegas Sept 12/2014 return Sept 15/2014. The seats are so tight and uncomfortable my legs were cramped up no entertainment onboard. Now it's time for me to try Westjet or Sunwing.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked an Air Canada flight to Vegas. I had no idea it was Rouge. Easily the worst flight very cramped no entertainment not even a cracker. The line up for the toilet went half way up the plane and you had to squeeze past people to get back to your seat! I will never fly Rouge again. Air Canada you have lost me.

Just returned from Barcelona on Air Canada's Rouge flight. I will not be doing this again. Terrible seating inexperienced flight attendants no entertainment units not even headphone connectors made a very boring and uncomfortable flight. Consider this a bargain basement airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have just come off a Rouge flight from Edinburgh. I had no idea what Rouge was and had booked on a standard flight on Air Canada. Since I am 6 foot 4 I had paid an extra $100 to be sure I could manage the leg space. I was appalled - I had an exit row seat that was bulkhead and smaller than a standard row seat on regular Air Canada. It was not possible to sit straight and I experienced significant leg cramps as a result. The absence of basic amenities such as TV movies and music unless you possess or rent an iPad was unacceptable. The only redeeming feature was the extremely pleasant staff. I am upset at having paid the extra cost and received no increased space.

Unfortunately AC has discontinued service of their full service line from YYC to LAS and there is no choice but to take Rouge. I have travelled in Premium Rouge once before and while I also disliked this Lufthansa short haul version of business class the economy service takes the cake! Seating is the most horrifying experience imaginable. I can honestly say I have never been on a plane where the seats were so uncomfortable and had such little room. I didn't even realize my legs had cramped up due to not being able to move until I tried to disembark the aircraft. I am 5'11 and my knees were wedged against the seat in front of me. I could not move my legs underneath the seat in front of me. I had used my frequent flyer comps to get a free meal from the BOB service. Even though I was the 6th person asked if I would like something from the BOB service my choice had "just run out". So I was stuck with a backup option. Additionally I told the FA that I had a meal included with my ticket and he did not believe me. I had to disrupt the people sitting next to me to reach my bag and dig out my boarding pass to show him the meal logo on it. I watched another FA scream at a passenger who desperately needed to use the lavatory because the seatbelt sign was on and "Your seat is the safest place for you! Please sit down!". The lack of an entertainment system is aggravating. I knew of this before leaving for my trip and am not willing to pay to download AC's not free entertainment app on my phone so I brought my small laptop to watch some movies. There was not enough room between the seats for me to open the lid on the laptop all the way. Of course all of this might be made tolerable for some people if the fares are discounted as you would expect on a self proclaimed "discount airline" Unfortunately I have been flying this route every 3 months for the last 4 years and can tell you the prices are exactly the same as what the full service AC has been charging. In other words a total scam. Never will I ever fly this airline again.

I flew from Barcelona to Toronto with Air Canada Rouge. The thing I hate is that we book a flight with the normal Air Canada and we get Rouge which has no TV and very little legroom. We flew in the 767-300ER. The whole flight took 8 hours. The seats are very cramped. It was a very unpleasant flight.

MTL-Las Vegas AC 1855 Sep 8th. LAS Vegas-Montreal AC1858 Sep 11. This is the worst airline I have flown with. I don't how much money AC is saving by adding the extra row of seats but it is inhuman to treat people this way. Flights attendants are inexperienced and clumsy. The best description would be "Cattle Class". I have flown over a million miles with Air Canada and my three flights with Rouge have been the worst experience of my life.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We were excited to hear that Air Canada was adding routes to Europe way back when we started booking a big family vacation this allowed us to fly into Venice and out of Rome on AC flights both ways. At the time Rouge had just started its international service so we didn't know what to expect but it's Air Canada right? It has to be at least decent. I have to say at this point thank goodness we changed our return flight date which meant we went from a Rouge flight to a regular AC flight. Travelling over 8 hours to Italy in those cramped circa 1970s metal framed seats was not fun and I had the luxury of a 4 year old next to me so I could use some of her space. I am not a tall person and I felt like my knees were in my armpits the entire time because of the ridiculously small seat pitch you can't actually recline your seat more than an inch maybe two inches. Fantastic for an overnight flight. At least they gave us pillows and blankets. Hardly any of us slept and it was a long boring flight since we don't all have ipads and theirs were booked. I'm curious to know how there is still no Android app for their stupid in-flight entertainment system but I digress. People also need to know that the reviews here are accurate regarding the overhead bins they are not regular carry-on size each bin could fit maybe 1 item - for 4 seats! I would also like to point out that flying Rouge is definitely a buyer beware activity. I'm not sure if there are any cases of the prices reflecting the "bargain airline" thing they are trying to be but I think it is all kinds of insanity to charge the same for this service as for regular Air Canada flights. I know this is true because AC had a schedule change that meant we went from a regular flight to a Rouge flight and the gentleman at the call centre warned me that we would be getting less service for the same money. In fact he was required to explain that to me and I had to agree and it was made clear that this would be recorded so that there would be no "misunderstandings. As a result I got so nervous I changed that flight to a different day to avoid having to fly Rouge home and thank goodness for that. Two of our party were in business class on Rouge that meant Premium Rouge or some such silliness and they had slightly bigger seat space and a curtain to divide them from the steerage behind on Air Canada they had pods with lie flat beds for the same price. I'm sad to say that this is no exaggeration. Now if I pay a little bit of money for a discount flight on a bargain airline okay I expect to get what I paid for - not much. But when you are paying full Air Canada fare and get bargain airline seats and service I'm not okay with it. People need to know that this is going on and make their dissatisfaction known with their dollars.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
The cabin couldn't be more cramped. Seats are so tight with zero leg room. Barely one person can walk down the aisle. Overhead bins full to explosion since they charge for baggage and with so little leg room people avoid putting things under the seat in front of them. Price for Rouge is same as regular AC flight. A total disaster!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Sep 7th AC1855. Sep 10th AC1854. Got "rouged" - where you don't know it's a Rouge flight until you get to the gate. It isn't indicated when booking flights - so you expect a regular Air Canada flight and instead you get this for the same price. No entertainment system or legroom or chargers. It's rubbish. Avoid at all costs.

Dep YYZ 1 September 2014 to CUN Dep CUN 11 September 2014 to YYZ Premium rouge 2A outbound and 2C inbound. After reading the horror stories about Rouge I approached these flights with some trepidation. With the exception of the A319 seating in Premium Rouge service was on par with the former business class. Meal selection and inflight service was up to par. The only issue I had was trying to use my own IPad the selection on the Rouge iPads was far superior. I do however object with paying business class for Premium rouge when other airlines only charge less for similar service and seats. Would I fly with them again? Yes.

Flew from Dublin to Toronto on Rouge on August 29/14. The worst flight. No entertainment on board you had to rent an iPad with few options. Small cramped seating and horrible food! The flight attendants seemed to be chatting amongst themselves rather than providing service. We would never fly anywhere any time on this airline again!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Rouge from Toronto to San Diego and return. Didn't know I was on a Rouge flight I should have paid more attention but then I didn't know what awaited me. What awaited me was the worst flying experience ever. There was no legroom. I rented an Ipad on the way down and was disappointed by the entertainment offering and they ran out of ipads on the return leg. I have been a long time supporter of Air Canada. I have always said that I knew what to expect (a service offering I was satisfied with) and when I got on an Air Canada flight to come home I felt I was home when I boarded the flight. I really have been a vocal supporter of Air Canada. But no longer. We are currently booking flights to Phoenix in January not on Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew to Phoenix AZ and back to Toronto on Rouge for the first time last week. The seating was cramped and the staff on the return flight were rude. In addition to having to pay for my checked luggage I had to pay for advanced seat selection. I am glad that I did because I could not have survived the trip in the middle seat being over 6 feet in height. This was my first and last Rouge flight. As a former Super Elite and Elite member for over 10 years I have become increasingly disappointed by Air Canada. I have switched to other airlines for overseas flights and will now give my remaining business to the competition even if I end up paying more.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew from Toronto to/from Barcelona on Rouge - specifically AC1914/AC1915. We flew AC because it was the only direct flight available. The general experience is ok but if given a choice in the future we will not fly Air Canada and definitely not Rouge. We were disappointed with the lack of entertainment screen - it's annoying to have to "rent" an ipad or download the app to our devices in order to see AC's selection of old movies and shows. What I find unforgivable is that AC actually served our meals (all passengers) with "bread roll" that were almost as hard as rocks. I think AC should review their food service.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Venice to Toronto B767-300ER and then to San Diego A319. It wasn't the best of experiences. It's not right to call Rouge Air Canada's budget alternative - it's Air Canada's substandard offering on many of their routes. It's not an alternative and it's not particularly cheap either. I flew Air Canada (I didn't even know about Rouge) because I am a United MileagePlus member and wanted to stick with United to maintain my Premier Silver status. I fly to and from Venice every September on business. In the past I used U.S. Airways but they're no longer part of the Star Alliance. On every other Star Alliance airline I have flown having Star Alliance Silver status has got me priority boarding - usually group 2 or similar. With Rouge you have to have Star Alliance Gold status to get priority seating and there is no other level. Next is the planes - they're Air Canada's oldest planes reconfigured to carry more passengers. This means thinner and less comfortable seats and less legroom - done in a drab gray. There is no reconfiguring of the overhead space to account for the higher passenger load. The 767s in particular have an outmoded overhead bin space design from the early 1980s that is very inefficient and does not accommodate modern carry-ons very well. When you have an additional 50 passengers to carry the problem only gets worse - expect a battle for bin space. The seats feel cheap and my tail bone ached through most of both flights from the hard surface underneath. The seats do recline but pressing the recline button nearly broke my finger - on both seats. On the 767 the flight attendant call button is on the armrest in a position you're quite likely to inadvertently press. As a result it happens all the time. I counted 11 flight attendant call lights lit in my part of the cabin at one point - so flight attendants don't pay attention to them anymore. There is power to the seats - but only 4 outlets for every 7 seats in each row. Expect to have to share an outlet with your seat mate. There are no USB power outlets. There are no onboard entertainment systems at each seat. Instead they wirelessly stream entertainment to your personal electronic device. However there is a catch. You can watch TV shows using a basic wi-fi connection but in order to watch movies you need to have downloaded their iPad/iPhone app before the flight. This feature is only available for the iPad/iPhone so if you have a laptop or Android device you're out of luck. The app is a simple wrapper around the website - there is absolutely no reason why you should have to have install the app to get to the movies. You can rent a limited number of iPads from the airline for $10. As for the entertainment itself it's pretty bad. While there were new episodes of Big Bang Theory and other recent shows most of the TV was old. The movies were mostly old or second rate. The inflight service wasn't bad. The food was good and service came often. We had a good lunch and idway through the flight there was a second service which included a bag of chips chocolate chip cookies. The final service included a small but tasty chicken pesto wrap. The young staff were attentive and friendly. Ground staff in Venice were friendly but not so good in Toronto. All in all this was a bad experience. Air Canada is cheapening their product with this sub-par airline. This feels more like a way around labor unions than an effort to build Air Canada into a great airline. It's such a disgrace that I vow to never fly either Air Canada or Air Canada Rouge again - that is my punishment for this awful excuse of an airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My husband and I just deplaned from the Toronto - Barcelona flight. Having read the mounting negative commentary on Rouge over the last few months we were prepared for the worse. We were pleasantly surprised. The 767-300 was clean and maintained the bathroom likewise the attendants all friendly and personable. We were in premium and there was a big blanket and pillow and a small bag of toiletries plus bottled water at our seats. Food was most satisfactory (same as AC as I had most of it earlier in the day). No complaints and such a relief to have gone Rouge. Plugs below the seats for the electronics. Premium rouge will never be business class - still rather cramped but I would fly it again and we will on our return home! The inflight entertainment was easy to hook up to with my iPad and mac air but it kept disconnecting necessitating 9 more clicks at least 10 times thru the flight to get the program back that I was watching.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked Air Canada Rouge return Ottawa to Las Vegas it was easily the worst airline experience I've had. I was Rouged many times on each flight and don't recommend this company to anyone. Narrow and very uncomfortable seats with little to no leg room (and I'm only 5'5). No inflight entertainment unless you have an ipad or want to rent one from them. Oh and your reward for renting the ipad is a terrible and tiny collection of entertainment choices. Don't forget to charge up your devices because there are no power sources on board. Which makes for a particularly long flight when you're crammed into an uncomfortable seat with no entertainment. Did I mention the food selection? It's not good either. Half and sometimes less than half of what's available on Air Canada flights. I could go on but I won't. It seems like others share my disdain. Don't bother booking premium rouge it's the same seats and same situation as the rest of the plane.

My wife and I flew Air Canada Rouge from Manchester to Chicago. We didn't know when we booked it that it was a Rouge flight. I will never fly with them again until they sort the leg room. It's a shame as everything else was OK but for a long haul flight I need to be able to sit down without my knees touching the seat in front. I'm a bit over 6 foot. Even my wife found if uncomfortable and she's a bit shorter than me. Basically unless it's so cheap that it makes up for the 8 hours of pain you'll get from being jammed into something even cattle transporters would consider cruel go with another airline.

After reading all the reviews here my wife and I didn't know what to expect from Rouge. We flew from Toronto to Edinburgh on Aug 28 and were very pleasantly surprised. My wife is pushing 6' and not once complained of leg room she did have an aisle seat where I get the window seat and I didn't have a problem either. Food was airplane food what else can I say it was hot and edible didn't once have a problem with any request from the crew. Crew was very professional and courteous young and full of energy. Must say better than some of the flight crew on the mainline AC a smile goes a long way. We flew Rouge on the return trip Sept 12 and experienced the same service. We knew of the inflight entertainment and came prepared I liked using my own IPad I could watch or listen to my own or theirs. We would fly again on Rouge we liked the route and really liked the price over mainline Air Canada.

I booked a flight direct on the Air Canada website choosing this flight over the slightly cheaper alternative thinking I would receive a higher level of service how wrong I was. What they don't tell you at the point of booking is that you are being fobbed off onto their 'no frills' budget organisation! The level of service onboard was shocking from boarding and realising there is no in-flight entertainment unless you rent one of their ipads at a cost of $10 or have pre downloaded their app onto your own device which is all well and good had we been informed of this prior to being sat on the runway with no internet access! With that disappointment settled in we move onto the food I've taken many long haul flights in my time but never experienced such poor quality food from stale bread to bland chicken that's barely warmed through is probably the only inflight meal I've not actually finished! On the returning leg we were fed the same for dinner and were treated to a soggy slice of banana cake for breakfast. Trying to get a drink during the flight is equally annoying when you are actually offered a drink you are lucky if they have what you want they push the apple and orange juice on you as if that's your only option but on both occasions I ordered apple (both legs) they had run out! Alcoholic beverages are also not complimentary which again is odd for a long haul and especially with a so called premium airline another disappointment was when I actually got a coffee it arrived with no stirrer or spoon as they had run out and was barely lukewarm and very poor quality! All in all a completely disastrous experience and one that I will never repeat!

AC1900 Toronto to Athens on July 17 return on AC1901 on Aug 7. Our flight on AC Rouge to Athens was comfortable and we found the staff to be friendly and competent. As others have commented the seats are close together but my husband and I were comfortable (I'm 5’ft 4” he is 5 ft 11”). The food and beverages were fine (meals included spicy pasta with a small salad or chicken breast with vegetables light snack included warmed wraps). We were regularly offered water during the 10 hour flight. With the Rouge app downloaded in advance the entertainment is fine. We had no trouble connecting to in-flight entertainment during our flight. Our son has an allergy to peanuts and having read the reviews on this site we were concerned for the cleanliness of the seats (potential cross contamination causing an allergic reaction) and the competence of the staff. Anyone with serious allergies will understand the level of worry that comes without access to medical assistance for a long period. On both our outgoing and return flights the flight attendants were very attentive and in both cases asked passengers sitting close to us to refrain from eating nuts which we greatly appreciated. We didn't use the blankets and pillow provided (brought our own) and brought allergy free food for my son so we didn't require any special or additional attention from AC.

Flight Number 1895 from Tampa to Toronto on September 2nd. My husband and I are both Super Elite 1000000 members. Air Canada Rouge is not up to Air Canada Standards! It is like a cattle car! People are stuffed into the seats like sardines. We were lucky enough to get bumped to Premium Rouge but it is still awful. The staff are very sweet and nice but when I asked what kind of red wine they had - she said we have a Chardonnay and a Cabernet! Surely you can do better Air Canada. In addition all of the ground staff at Tampa Airport are leaving or have left because of the treatment they receive from Rouge Management and staff. We have taken Flight 902 and 903 for over 30 years from Tampa to Toronto and Toronto to Tampa.

I have been an Air Canada Aeroplan member for over 30 years and I do a lot of overseas traveling from my home base in Phoenix Arizona. Fortunately Air Canada has connected Phoenix with Toronto since the mid 1990's making overseas connections quite easy. In winter there is additional service to Calgary which enables flight connections to London and Frankfurt. Recently Phoenix service was converted to the new Air Canada Rouge budget category. All I kept reading were negative reviews about how cramped the business class was and how poor the food and service were. I traveled to Toronto on July 1 to connect to Frankfurt and returned from Toronto (Copenhagen) on August 30. Frankly I found nothing wrong with Air Canada Rouge. Yes the seats are smaller coach seats with the middle seat blocked out. But there was almost as much legroom as on a regular Air Canada domestic flight. As for lunch en route to Toronto and Breakfast returning to Phoenix the food quality was comparable to a regular domestic Air Canada flight. And the young flight attendants though not clearly as experienced were very attentive. I would prefer a return of regular Air Canada service but I did find Rouge an acceptable choice and with Calgary now being a year around connection and the addition of Vancouver I am very pleased. These are short flights and the added comfort of domestic first class would be nice but I for one can live without it.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
No leg room on the airbus A319 and not much more on B767 and I am only 5 foot 9 and my son 5 ft 5. Plane clean and staff pleasant but very narrow seats and as already said no leg room. Could not get the entertainment system to work on either laptop running window or tablet on android and the staff did let us have an ipad but this ran out of battery and the replacement froze more times so gave this up. On the return the weather made us late and they kept us informed but often a little late ie say ground crew were finishing up loading luggage but the ground warning light had restarted flashing so they could not work whilst this was on so speeding up information would have helped. Overall wish I spent an extra a few pounds and gone with United or US Airways.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada you have hit a new low it's called Rouge. Worst flight to Barbados in many years. They may fool some with their flight attendants wearing cute trilby hats as passengers boarded and with the cute pink headbands (my 5 year old grand daughter wears a similar one) while "attending" in flight but we were not fooled. They cannot try to mimic Westjet service until they actually do the work to train staff to actually believe that their job is to make their customers feel secure looked after and yes catered to! If they plan to staff their Rouge plane for an international flight it's a good idea to inform them of the entering countries landing document. When we asked for our landing cards we were told that they would be handed out at 2.10 (we arrived in B'dos at 2.25). We told them that B'dos requires a landing doc for each person not one per family as she rudely tried to tell me when I asked for 2 forms! Yikes! Immediately after the cards were handed out (one per family except for us) they told us to prepare for landing seats upright and tables closed - while everyone was still filling out their forms! After we landed the customs officers were scrambling to get people to fill out their forms. Make sure you have your ipads charged if you want entertainment. The seat monitors are gone. You can rent an ipad for 10 Cdn. But they have no means of charging your device. Also if you are taller than 5 feet and weigh more than 125 lbs you won't fit. It's unfortunate that Air Canada has no idea what the repercussions are when bad service comes into play. But then again they really don't care.

I flew from Winnipeg to Cancun with Rouge in August. My husband and I took 23 guests on our wedding vacation. From the get-go our entire wedding party had an awful experience. The flight from Toronto: in the beginning we were frustrated that we didn't get certain things that were promised to us when we booked our wedding through Air Canada Vacations. We were supposed to receive a complimentary upgrade which we did not (to make matters more frustrating there was another wedding party on the same flight of which the bride and groom were upgraded). They were also supposed to hang my dress on the plane and when my mom asked they said there was no room. While this on its own was frustrating the flight was delayed by about an hour. We were told to stay in our seats with our seatbelts fastened this entire time. We were travelling with our 9 month old daughter. When I got up to get her formula out of the overhead bin about halfway through this wait I was rudely scolded by the flight attendant and told to sit down. She slammed the bin shut. Everything else about the experience is just how most people say - seats are jam packed with virtually no leg room there is absolutely no in-flight entertainment and they only offer juice water and pop (everything else you need to pay for). If I thought the flight there was bad I don't even know what to call the flight home. After boarding the plane in Cancun we sat on the tarmac for three hours while they tried to sort out mechanical issues. Again travelling with a baby this was a complete nightmare. During the entire wait we were offered water twice. Eventually they told us we would be staying in Cancun. We disembarked and they put us in a small holding area with no air conditioning. We waited here for another three hours without being offered any food or drink. When passengers started to get testy they walked us through the airport to immigration. We waited and waited while all 200+ passengers went back through immigration and security. When we finally got outside and hopped on shuttles the Air Canada Rep said "the hotel is all-inclusive - go eat drink. When we got to the hotel they told us that Air Canada had not in fact paid for all-inclusive. We were only entitled to a meal and two non-alcoholic beverages. While this wasn't a huge deal it just demonstrates the disorganization and lies that were the theme of our entire day. I will never travel with Air Canada Rouge again. The next morning at the airport only some of our wedding guests were given connecting flights through to Winnipeg. Once we arrived in Toronto we were sent home on three separate flights. On our flight there were six guests. Three were offered a complimentary food item "for their trouble". Apparently the rest of us (including the bride and groom) were not on the "list". All in all Air Canada Rouge turned our wedding vacation into a complete nightmare.

Do not fly Air Rouge unless you are happy being canned in like a sardine. I could not reach under my seat without hitting my face on the seat in front of me that is how tight the seats are packed and this is coming from a person who is practically 5 feet tall. I have always flown AC but now that I have flown my first Air Rouge flight it I feel cheated. The worst part is that this horrible flight was not a discounted flight I paid $1000 for an overpriced flight from San Diego. All the lovely Air Canada amenities are gone - do not expect entertainment instead expect to pay for an ipad that will be confiscated from you and hour prior to landing. Do not expect comfortable seats or leg room. Avoid flying Rouge at all costs!

I flew from Manchester (UK) to Toronto on Air Canada Rouge. Everything was OK apart from the leg room. I'm a bit over 6 foot tall and my knees were jammed into the seat in front. For a long haul flight this was intolerable; I will never fly with them again until they fix this. It was a shame as everything else on the flight was better than I expected for the price - modern plane smiling staff and reasonable food.

Thinking of flying Air Canada Rouge? Don't. Thinking about booking business class with Air Canada Rouge believing it can't be all that bad? Don't. My partner and I flew in business class from Toronto to Las Vegas. Tickets cost $1600. We were seated in Premium Rouge for this exorbitant price. There were no business class seats only economy seats with a spare seat in the middle. We were in the front row and could not even move the armrests or stretch our legs out fully. They even tried to get out of providing my partner with the amenities pack (which consists of a blanket eyemask and ear plugs) by saying they would just give him the blanket only - he insisted on the full pack. Entertainment is via an iPad which lo and behold business class passengers get for "free" while economy passengers have to pay $10 for the privilege. The iPad is useless. Cabin crew are young and try to be funky and upbeat. This falls pretty flat when you get on board and realise what awaits you. Never again.

Last night I travelled back from Barbados to Toronto but was diverted to Montreal. I do have some very serious questions though based on my experience. 1) Why was there no-one from AC to guide the passengers from the Barbados flight to the new check in location. Many of the passengers were elderly Barbadians who would not be able to speak French. I have traveled a lot can speak French and even I found the journey from immigration to check in very confusing. 2) Why are we then made to make our own bookings when we are already significantly inconvenienced? 3) When we try and make the booking why are we kept on hold for so long at 1am in the morning and why then was I put on hold not once but twice for a total of an extra 25 minutes so it took a total of one hour to do what should have been a very simple process that usually takes 10 minutes maximum in the daytime. This is at a time when I should have been sleeping as I had to get up at 4.00am for a 6.00am domestic flight as the AC booking officer then told me I would have to go through the whole process of queuing up etc to get my ticket so should leave at least 2 hours. Just a very disappointing experience from a Brand with which I had much higher expectations.

Flight AC1901 ATH to YYZ. Is there anything lower than one star? Absolutely embarrassing service lack of professionalism by not one but all staff. No entertainment system no decent food and you have to beg for a glass of water. It's really as if you are annoying the staff just by being there. Staff member observed yelling and screaming at passengers for disobeying the seatbelt sign. Awful airline with no positive comments.

YYZ-LAS. On 27th August we were scheduled to travel from Toronto to Las Vegas on Air Canada Rouge with a 0850 departure time. On check in (at 06.50) the Air Canada Check In agent greeted us with "It is my pleasure to inform you this flight is delayed until 17.00". She did actually use the word "pleasure". So an over eight hour delay no apology no explanation. The flight did not leave at 17.00 but 17.55 - a nine hour delay! We were to drive from Las Vegas to Grand Canyon in the afternoon. Instead we drove through the night arriving at 02.00. Air Canada Rouge is a disgrace to call itself and Airline offering a service. In thirty years of travelling on numerous different Airlines we have never experienced such poor service. You book via Air Canada however end up on the Third Rate Rouge. Then you are offered a discount on a future flight. We do need to note that staff on the actual flight were very good. No issues. Also previous Air Canada flights have not been a problem. We will never fly Air Canada Rouge again.

I had the pleasant experience of traveling to Toronto from San Francisco on mainline AC and then from Toronto to Athens on AC Rouge and let me tell you I would choose Rouge over mainline AC every single time. The flight attendants were fantastic we were served drinks almost every hour and we were given two meals which were just as good as the meals on any other airline. The in-flight entertainment app had the exact same movies/shows as the mainline flight and it worked perfectly fine. Did I mention that the flight attendants were extremely nice? The plane (Boeing 767) was clean and updated but no charge ports anywhere in economy. We flew back to the states on Lufthansa and I was much more comfortable on our Rouge flight. For a discount airline (yes discount. Our tickets were so cheap! I'm not sure where these other people are booking their flights) Rouge is great and I'll definitely be flying with them again.

Booked a vacation to Jamaica through Air Canada Vacation. The both Rouge flights were the worst experience. No room for legs outdated video entertainment narrow aisle between cramped 3x3 rows all two washrooms at the end of the plane. According to CBC "Rouge seats on the Airbus 319-100 have 73.5 cm of pitch compared with 79-89 cm on the same aircraft on a regular Air Canada flight" and that is true! Quite bad business decision Air Canada leadership made. I will make every effort not to fly with Rouge ever more even if I have to change my trip destination.

I found the seats and spacing comfortable in coach. The design is minimalist. I understand that taking the wiring and screens out of the seats reduces the cost weight and maintenance. My wife had an issue with the lack of ventilating port above the head. She was hot the entire flight. I was comfortable. I don't like the message Air Canada sends when they encourage a monopoly in their own aircraft by only supporting Apple devices. It doesn't take that much effort to create the applications for Android and BlackBerry. My frustration spans from the surprise I got taking a 5 hour flight with no entertainment. Had I known I would have loaded a few movies on my Android tablet. This was last May and they said then that the Android app was coming. 5 months later it is still not out.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
After reading all the reviews I was very concerned about flying rouge - but I must say that we had a great flight from Rome to Montreal on August 31st. The crew were very friendly and helpful. The planes were old but very clean. There were more than enough Ipads for purchase at $10 for inflght entertainment. For me the hospitality of the crew is very important and it was nice to be treated well.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Terrible experience flying AC Rouge last week. Delayed 5+ hours on my Toronto-Las Vegas flight (due to mechanical issues no notification until arrival at the airport 2 hrs in advance of the flight time so a total of 7h spent idle) then delayed 10+ hours on return flight 2 days later no reason given. On the first flight by the time the food cart reached Aisle 40 there was little left and on the second there was no food cart period. People boarded with more than one carry on bag limiting the overhead space available for everyone - the crew worked very hard to find space for everyone anywhere onboard and should be commended for their hard work and cheerfulness - and the in-flight entertainment selection was dismal. Load up your iPad/phone before you go. I will never travel Rouge again if it can be helped. Very disappointing experience.

AC1830 on August 13 AC1831 on August 20. I was quite nervous about flying with Rouge given all the negative things I have heard from friends and family. My flight to my destination was uneventful - on time boarding was easy staff were friendly and I lucked out in that nobody was in the middle seat so I was able to stretch my legs given the compressed seating this was a major plus. The flight home was overbooked which although did not impact me is frustrating to have to deal with. The entertainment options are extremely limited - very few movies and episodes of TV shows. Staff were friendly and helpful no complaints there. Given my flight was short - just over five hours - it was a good experience. I wouldn't be comfortable flying with them on longer flights because of the lack of space. All in all they got me where I needed to go and that's all that matters.

AC1906 YYZ to VCE on Sat 30 Aug 2014. Booked ticket 8 months in advance: No inflight entertainment system not at all not even the old TV screen on the upperhead. You need an iPad to download a specific application to use the inflight system and iPad alone because they do not sponsor Galaxy. Seats are small with tight leg space (flew a 767-300). What can we say about the flight attendants with their grey hats - who designed this? Flying rouge is like going back in time when flying Air Transat 15 years ago.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My wife and I recently flew from Toronto to Phoenix with Rouge. It all started at the airport when they did not have a flight attendant show up so no one could board for over an hour. I am only 5'9" but found my knees up in my chest during the 4 hour flight and very uncomfortable. Never fly with Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I return from LAX to YVR with Air Canada Rouge. I'm 6'2". There is no legroom. I had my knees against the front seat and my lower back pressured against my seat the entire flight. Extremely uncomfortable and unmanageable. My knees were half way through my neighbours seats. I have always flown Air Canada to have legroom. This time is now over and they now have lost a long time client. I have flown with low cost carriers in Asia and you expect what you pay for. Here you get less for the same price as before.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have travelled Rouge last month and if I had a choice as to who to fly with I would never pick Rouge the seats are crowded. No entertainment available except at an extra cost. Absolutely disappointed with this flight we travel Air Canada all the time as we travel to Arizona at least 3-4 times a year with Air Canada and have never had a problem I travelled this time and it was terrible.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I recently booked a flight on the Air Canada website from Toronto to Barcelona and back. Air Canada "Rouge" seemed marginally cheaper so I went with that. Nowhere in the booking process was there any warning that "Rouge" is essentially AC's version of Air Transat at AC prices: they've ripped out all the seats with entertainment systems and replaced them with pre-1970 style seats decreased the seat spacing and if you want a beer or glass of wine you have to pay through the nose. It would have been nice to have some indication of this in advance! On top of that the service was slow and terrible. Whoever in AC management thought that creating something as sub-par as Rouge was a wise business decision needs to have their head examined. This will do irreparable damage to AC's already sliding reputation.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I booked my flight from Rome to Los Angeles with Air Canada which I have flown with before and enjoyed. It was not until I received my booking confirmation that I realized that the first leg of the trip (Rome to Montreal) was with Rouge and the second leg (Montreal to LA) was with regular AC. After having already committed I checked the reviews for Rouge and became startled. All of the negative comments had me dreading the trip. It is a long flight and to be cramped would suck. Much to my surprise and pleasure the seats were fine! Of course I have noticed that most of the negative reviews were for Airbus planes and we flew on a 767 but the seats were identical to the regular AC flight we took on our second leg. There was plenty of leg room. In fact there was more leg room on the Rouge flight than on the Lufthansa flight we took getting there. The seats were plenty wide. The staff were a little young but nice and cheerful. The food was great and plenty of it. I read so many bad things about the lack of inflight entertainment but then they played two recently released movies on the cabin televisions more than I got on my last American Airlines flight going the same route. Overall it was a great flight and experience. In fact it was much better than the second leg we flew on regular AC in that the staff sucked on the AC flight and they charged for snacks and food. The only thing better was the in flight entertainment was in the headrests which is always great. Bottom line I would definitely fly Rouge again and would recommend to friends.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I had AC Rouge for the return flight of my itinerary (BCN to YUL) and was dreading the 8 hour return trip based on the reviews I read here. I was pleasantly surprised perhaps due to my own lowered expectations and was compelled to write this review as I don't think this airline is getting a fair shake. The plane itself was clean and in good condition and the crew was friendly courteous and helpful. The flight offered meal service which was no better/worse than any other airline I've flown. Regarding the leg room I found no difference between AC Rouge and coach class on other airlines. By comparison I've flown transatlantic on Air Transat Air France and United and frequently use AC main line within North America. If there is a difference it's negligible. Overall I'd say the leg room was "industry standard". For instance during this same vacation I took a short haul flight with Vueling which I would say had "no leg room". Regarding inflight entertainment I consider this a non-issue. Yes there is no inflight entertainment other than the movies shown on the main cabin screens. However in this day and age of smartphones and tablets I was more than satisfied to watch movies of my choice on my phone. The only thing that would've been nice would be to have had USB chargers for devices (my daughters tablet ran out of battery 3/4 way through the flight). Ultimately my first priority is reaching my destination safely and for this reason alone I tend to gravitate towards Air Canada. Factor in the competitive pricing and I'm likely to fly with Rouge again at some point.

AC1752 July 31 2014 and AC1753 Aug 7 2014. I have never been so disappointed by an airline! I paid what I thought was business class and found it to be cattle class. Nothing and I mean nothing provided. I will avoid Air Canada vacations if this is their primary carrier! I now have to book a trip to San Diego . Last time it was air Canada and it was business class. Now they dump it to Rouge and they have the nerve to call this business class? Same price without any service. They should be ashamed to call this anything but cattle air. Bring drinks and real food with you! Just fly with them once and you will see!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Before booking our flights to Canada we debated between Virgin (our usual airline to the US) or Air Canada. Our agent told us that although Virgin were better Air Canada would be fine with similar legroom entertainment food etc. this was last year before anyone in the UK had heard of Rouge. The seats only recline one inch the person behind me who was just average height had his knees in my back the whole journey there are no air vents above the seats and the entertainment is shocking. For an airline to introduce a new service which is in effect a transatlantic budget airline but still with Air Canada prices is absolutely appalling.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
LIS-YYZ. Poor communication embarrassing service and a disappointing lack of even a modicum of care about their passengers seems to be how this airline operates. Flight got cancelled in the middle of the night. We received just a text (and not even an email) to a link with our updated flight "status. Essentially we had two options: stay in a hotel organized by the airline or go on your own and hope to be reimbursed. We were told that we would be rebooked on a flight 21 hours later. After the most unbelievable line at check in (one person said he had been waiting for 2 hours. Note that we were the only AC flight going out that day) we checked our boarding passes to see that we were actually delayed again by another 2 hours putting us 23 hours behind schedule. We didn't even get a text telling us this so we woke up at 5 am for no reason. It's not really Air Canada - don't let the name fool you. No attempt to rebook us was made like a normal airline. I once flew American Airlines not exactly known for its service and had a flight cancelled only to be rebooked (ironically) on Air Canada. Don't expect that decency from Rouge. I will never ever take this airline again. I'm a proud Canadian but I'll be looking elsewhere. These reviews are awful for a reason. Watch out.

YUL-YYZ on Air Canada Express YYZ-LAS on Air Canada Rouge. All the flights went smooth and on time from take off to landing. I knew what to expect when I purchased the ticket on Air Canada Rouge. There's no entertainment unless you have an Apple device (such as Ipad) and have download their application and be aware there's no charging ports on board. The flight crew was fine nothing special you have to purchase for meals. Overall it's pretty much the same service on a normal Air Canada flight but with less legroom even in the emergency exists the legroom is not a lot. Overall you get what you paid for on Air Canada Rouge which is fine but don't expect a super service and lots of legroom unless you fly in Premium class.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Toronto to Barcelona return in early August. Worst overseas flight I have taken. When I compare Air Canada Rouge to regular Air Canada it's like night and day. The seats on Rouge are very uncomfortable and cramped. Inflight entertainment is barely acceptable. In order to access it you have to own an iPad or rent one on board. The movies are old and out of date. On the return flight from Barcelona to Toronto there was garbage (including used napkins and food) from the previous flight still lying on the ground when we boarded. It was filthy. One of the bathrooms was out of service for the nearly 9 hour flight from Barcelona to Toronto. Every time the seatbelt sign turned off when there wasn't turbulence people rushed to the bathrooms that actually worked. Flight attendants seemed very young and inexperienced. I will try to avoid Air Canada Rouge in the future. They charge the same airfare as Air Canada regular except you're getting an inferior service.

Flew Rouge Flight AC1836 from Phoenix to Toronto on Aug 26 2014. The worst flight ever! Felt crammed in our seats with no leg room. I am 5'6" and am glad that I was not taller. Could not stretch my legs during the flight and felt the knees of the person sitting behind me most of the flight. I do not understand why we have to rent an iPad for onboard entertainment when a regular Air Canada flight has a touch screen in the seat back directly in front of you. Certainly not the same as a regular Air Canada flight. I will avoid flying Rouge in any way even taking connecting flights or changing my destination so that I will not be on a Rouge flight. Unfortunately Air Canada Rouge is the only option for direct flights for certain destinations. If a discount airline was truly an optional airline then why don't they also offer regular Air Canada flights to these same destinations. Rouge is every bit a discount airline without the discount price. Avoid Rouge! If Air Canada wants a discount airline they can offer Rouge with more leg room. At least you know ahead of time that you are getting screwed! I will fly anyone else to avoid Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Our family traveled from Vancouver to Los Angeles with Air Canada Rouge last week. We found the staff to be the nicest flight staff by far from all airlines we have travelled with before. We have flown multiple times with US Airways Air Canada and West Jet we found that Rouge was the friendliest by far. An example what the staff did for us if that they saw that we traveled with an infant the flight was completely full however the flight attendants get 3 reserved seats at the very back of the plane for them to rest they gave up this entire row so my daughter could sleep laying down on 2 seats and myself beside her. I usually don't write comments online but I see people always writing poor comments online I want people to read this and see that the staff do everything to make the flight the best for the passengers the seats are more tight however their service makes it worthwhile for me to fly with them again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
They get an overall rating of 2/10 because I at least got to my destination (Edinburgh - Vancouver return) in the end and the air hostesses were very pleasant and friendly. However positives then stop. Inflight entertainment has to be purchased (unless you have an appropriate mobile device on you) 4.5 hour flight from Toronto-Vancouver requires purchase of food and the was a huge overbooking problem with truly abysmal ground staff help. From Vancouver to Toronto I was put on standby for no apparent reason despite having an international connection in Toronto and checking in hours in advance. The Air Canada help desk was totally inadequate (1 person only for a long queue although she was pleasant - maybe because unfairly inconvenienced people were being exceptionally polite to her despite having massive delays enforced upon them) and the staff at the gate were unacceptably rude. For example a couple with a baby who had checked in 2.5 hours in advance were rudely told that their failure to get a seat was entirely their fault as they should have checked in even sooner. No apology for what struck me as breach of contract by Air Canada. I eventually did get on my planned flight but in a very negative state of mind.

Flew from Toronto to Rome (Connecting through Montreal) on August 15 2014. I decided to spend the extra $$ and book a "Premium Rouge" seat. I am 6'3" and normally try and book the "Preferred Seating" on mainline AC for all my flights just to have the leg/knee room. Flying from YYZ-YUL was mainline AC and I upgraded the day of to Business Class. I think this gave me a false sense of hope for the Rouge portion of the trip. First off the plane (767-300) was disgusting. The plane must have been at least 20-25 years old. It was dirty as can be with seats falling apart in the Premium Rouge cabin. In terms of leg/knee room. It was virtually the same as North American Business Class on mainline AC so more than enough room with decent recline for an over-night flight. Nowhere near the quality of the Pod seats but let's be realistic I paid substantially less for this flight as compared to mainline AC Executive First. Second the staff as described by many others were very friendly young and enthusiastic however that's where the positive reviews end. It took them over 2 hours to serve the first meal/drink service (there were only 5 people in Premium Rouge cabin) and they were very inattentive. The crew gave me the sense that they were not in control of the flight's service whatsoever. Always seemed un-organized and the so called "Dedicated lead Rouge crew" for Premium Rouge were non-existent. I did not speak to the same flight attendant more than once. All-in-all this was the worst flight experience I have ever had and I'm saying this knowing full-well what the reviews on Rouge are. I will avoid Rouge at all costs.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Just had the worst experience on an aircraft and will never fly Air Canada Rouge again. Flew 8 hours to Venice (9 back). Absolutely no leg room (if you're 5'8' or taller). Seats only go back an inch or two (but then again-that's because there is no leg room). No overhead controls for air. Also took 20 minutes for an attendant to answer our call button. Our movies cut out 6 times. Had to restart and judge where we'd left off. Absolutely dreaded our return flight. Never again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YYZ-MCO. Absolutely terrible leg room! This seems to be a recurring issue based upon the multiple reviews below. Listen up Air Canada your customers are giving you vital feedback but you appear to be doing nothing about it! Won't be flying Rouge again until something is done about this problem. Smarten up as we have other choices.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Do you prefer quality or cheap pricing? (Vancouver - Maui). My parents brother and myself flew to Maui on February 13. Our flight was supposed to leave at 6.20 but we were delayed for 2.5 hours! Once we boarded we then found out that there were mechanical issues so we had to de-board the Boeing 767-300/ER. Another 2 hours later and we were finally off to Maui. The flight wasn't anything to write home about - what you would expect from a "low budget" airline. But what was upsetting is that we did not arrive in Maui until around 4.30-5 in the morning. We had to wait 3 hours until the car rental places opened up. I would not recommend Air Canada Rouge to any Canadians that are planning on going to Hawaii this fall or winter. Take Alaska Airlines or Hawaiian out of either Seattle or Portland. You definitely know what you are getting from those two airlines.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
No seat back entertainment for transatlantic flight Toronto to Dublin yes I know you can have your personal electronic and download app but with three kids - nice/need to have hands free! Seats as hard as the road no leg room and when I asked flight attendant to ask the person in front to put their seat upright just for the meal service I was told no you have to ask them. Shirking the responsibility or what? Instead of fancy ridiculous looking uniforms that probably cost a fortune what about spending it on the very outdated 767!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew back from Rome to Montreal (9 hour plus flight) plus had a one hour delay Have been spoiled by the regular Air Canada flights (elite status). Had read emails about the "Rouge" experience from others well Air Canada has embarked on a journey to destroy their brand which took many years of solid service to develop. Forget the direct flights with Rouge take the alternatives. My next trip to Europe will be with Lufthansa. Nice to have had the chance to catch up on old movies - due to lack of choice!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Manchester UK to Toronto 6/8/2014 - returned 22/8/2014. Chose them because they had a good name did not realise it was not Air Canada and secondly price. Really good price for this time of year. The cabin crew were young I like their trendy uniform. I think the return journey crew were better than the outbound only because going they were asked questions about travel connections and should the passenger pick up their luggage or would it be transferred they did not know the answer. Also I think the return journey at night is easier for the crew because people sleep. I found the crew very attentive and very friendly they did not forgot requests from passengers. The downside of the flight - no duty free I did not realise this on my outward journey. The inflight entertainment I had read you could purchase a tablet for $10 which I did on my outward journey - the tablet kept freezing whilst I watched a film. I think it took me 3 hrs to watch the film. Other passengers also had problems. I did not purchase the tablet on the return journey but the same thing happened but they made an announcement that they rebuffed the machine and I think that did work but they didn't do this on the outward journey. The food was ok although I am not a fan of airline food and would of preferred a salad or a sandwich. These days it is hard for crew with food requirements there were a lot of different diets and it was not made easy when the passengers moved seats but they handled it very well. I would definitely travel with this airline again. My seats were fine I had leg room. Yes it is no frills but not everyone can afford luxury travel and also don't always rely on bad reviews. I was surprised how good my flights were.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My family and I flew Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Athens Aug 5th and back Aug 21st. I was satisfied with the flight and service. Rouge is a discount airline. That means slightly smaller seats less leg room and paying extra for anything beyond the basics (like liquor). Rouge delivered value for what I paid. The staff are young pleasant and did a good job. The inflight entertainment worked well. The fact that you need to bring your own device was communicated to us twice by the airline prior to departure and there are plugs to charged your devices on the flight. The food was as good as any economy class food that I've had.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
AC 1854 13 Aug 2014 LAS-YYZ. Rouge is an intentional cheat by Air Canada management. This masquerade - selling Rouge under the guise of normal AC is criminal. You don't even know it's Rouge at time of booking. No difference in fare from normal AC. Aircraft (A319) is fine. Staff are fine. Issue is seats and legroom even for smaller people. Would be OK for flights less than 2 hours but to use for cross-Canada/US is absolute rubbish. Stand up Air Canada and don't even put the label Air Canada before Rouge. We know the game and it's clear it's all about cheating the customer.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
After 5 flights on Rouge I will avoid them at all costs and fly any other alternative most likely WJ from now on. All my rouge experiences have been on the lowly 319's and on YYC-LAS-YYC but as so many others have stated leg room is number 1 (I'm 6'2) uncomfortable seats (I can't understand how some reviewers say these are comfortable?) lack of any amenities. Cheerful and enthusiastic but non-effective FA's Very poor gate's at LAS (compared to WJ) etc. I've heard the 767's are marginally better (30" pitch vs 29" doesn't sound like anything wonderful) but at this point I'm not willing to even try if that's an option in the future. AC you've lost another LT customer.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I am a seasoned business traveller. I've flown just about every week for the past three years mostly on Star Alliance partner airlines and very regularly with Air Canada. I flew Air Canada Rouge from Las Vegas to Toronto and was completely and wholly dissatisfied with my experience. I'm a big guy (6'2) but by no means a giant. I could not even come close to fitting my legs straight in my seat. I had to sit with my legs bent for a 4 hour+ flight and am still feeling it in my knees and back two days after the flight. The plane was sweltering hot - I witnessed at least a dozen different passengers complain about how warm it was only to have the flight attendants tell us that the temperature could not be controlled by them (obviously a lie). And despite being a red eye the plane flew with significant cabin lighting on. I've flown many red eye's before and have never seen such a bright cabin. I know Air Canada will respond with some ridiculous template message that there is an option for preferred/first class seating with more leg room but in this case the flight was full and a first class upgrade was going to cost me over $200. I will make it my personal mission to never fly Air Canada Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Dublin - Toronto return. After all the bad reviews I've read about Rouge I was quite apprehensive when the holiday started. We were pleasantly surprised that our trip turned out to be one of the best yet. The seats we were given were the middle seats no 15 and my son and I discovered that there was a USB charger. And because I prepared for our trip we were armed with our ipads complete with the apps. We also noticed that our seats had bigger leg room unfortunately the ones behind us had less. Why this is I don't know. Did we pay a bit more so that we were afforded this comfort? We were also assigned no 13 seats on our return flight so we were anticipating a comfortable ride but we were fortunately upgraded to premium Rouge so it was even so much better! Can't explain this either but I'm not complaining! Food was not the best but reasonable the premium rouge was not that much better but was ok. Drinks were constantly offered in our outbound journey no alcohol though. In premium alcohol was free but it was the cheap kind. Nothing different from what other airlines offer. Air hostesses and stewards friendly and helpful the toilets were relatively clean so nothing to complain about really! Check in both ways were easy boarding was ok. The plane was late 1 hr coming back but we had a 6 hr wait for our connection so no worries there! I'll fly Rouge anytime but maybe pay the high(ish) fare?

AC 1920 August 4th YUL-FCO. AC 1921 August 18th FCO-YUL. Probably the worst airline I have ever flown with. What a disappointment! Nothing is up to date old aircraft with no leg room. The application for personal entertainment kept on crashing. Worst food ever. Never again.

Star Alliance Gold Million Miler. I recently flew from Los Angeles to Montreal on Air Canada connecting to my Rome flight on Rouge. I must tell you I was terrified to fly Rouge after reading all the reviews. I was seated in Row 27 directly behind the Exit Row with 2 seats next to the window. I will start by saying that the experience on Rouge was good and comparable to other airlines in Coach Cabin (not preferred Seating or Economy plus). The recline was average and leg room fine I am 5'7' and was able to stretch my leg under the seat. The flight was full and the crew did a nice job with meal and drink service. I would definitely flew them again not my first choice but will fly them again if necessary. They did recognize my Star Alliance status and early boarding.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I can understand Air Canada trying to compete with other lower cost carriers but with their Airbus planes used by Rouge I think they have gone too far. Last week I flew from Toronto to Montego Bay with Rouge (Airbus) and 2 days ago the return flight with the same plane. The seat pitch is far to small I am 5 ft 8 in and my knees had only about 1 inch of clearance and the seat cushions don't have the density to cushion anything. There is a huge difference between Rouge and regular Air Canada flights. I would not recommend Rouge simply due to the uncomfortable seats and the lack of legroom.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew from Toronto (YYZ) to Venice (VCE) on the 767-300ER. Rouge is simple but still provided a pleasant flight. Leg room not bad at all. Flight attendants were all female and young. Hot meal served but alcohol costs money. No video screens but who cares when you have a good-looking crew to look at.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I knowingly booked on AC Rouge YVR-SFO because that's the only flight which worked with my schedule. Flight was delayed one hour but that's due to SFO runway construction/inbound restrictions. We were kept updated so no complaints there. In all fairness the in-flight service was no better or worse than any mainline AC short-haul service (that is serviceable without wow factor.) Where they really fall down is the lack of legroom. 29" pitch felt rather claustrophobic and I'm not even tall. Be warned if you're anything over 5'5". I did appreciate one of the pilots standing by the door thanking passengers upon disembarking. All in all for an 1 hr 50 flight it really was quite okay and I'd do the same flight with AC Rouge in the future. Any longer I don't think I'll ever go for based on seat discomfort alone. P.S. we were only offered a small cup of juice/pop/water but for such a short flight I really don't give a toss.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Toronto to Punta Cana. I booked using Air Canada vacations on mistaken assumption that this would afford me a better seat due to star alliance status. Of my 1 million miles flown most international this is my first user review and this flight was the worst seat with the worst legroom that I have ever experienced. Plus the wonderful person in front of me reclined throughout all the time airborne. I guess buyer beware and I should have researched the airline before but I do feel scammed by AC and won't be flying them again any time soon.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I was expecting an Air Canada flight with the same service I have been used to over the years only to find out at the last minute I was on a Rouge flight. I paid the same price as an Air Canada flight but ended up with Rouge. Just when I was expecting a Calgary - Vegas nice comfortable flight I ended up with this expensive bait and switch. Now if I paid a third less cost for my flight then it would be no issue.

YYZ-MCO. This is basically a budget airline so with that in mind it wasn't bad. My main criticism was the terrible legroom - I would suggest they fix the seats in the upright position as the European budget carriers do because when someone reclines it really is very uncomfortable.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flight 1899 on May 9th. The airline might be marketing this as low cost but it is certainly low cost for them and not the passengers. I got "rouged" on a "business" flight from Las Vegas and thought for a second I was on Ryanair or Air Berlin. In business they took the Lufthansa short haul idea of simply blocking the economy seat off next to you. The flight attendant told me after we took off that I would need an app on my phone (how can I get that in flight?) and then halfway through the flight offered me an iPad to use after I complained this was pretty silly. It wasn't cheaper it wasn't good it was all around terrible. I guess it helps AC make their sales number but it sure doesn't help the passengers in any way. Maybe if it was 50% less than what it is now it might be worth a look. Steer clear!

6 August YUL-YYZ (AC 835) YYZ-SAN (AC-Rouge 1887). 12 August SAN-YYZ (AC-Rouge Business 1886) YYZ-YUL (AC 834). One of the worst flights that I have taken - absolutely no leg room an entertainment selection that malfunctioned on two flights and shockingly unprofessional service. The worst business class in the industry. The only thing that is low cost about Rouge is the service and comfort.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
When flight was booked we were not told it was Air Canada Rouge and did not find out until we selected seats. Legroom was totally inadequate. I am 6" tall and could not sit with my legs straight forward. I had to angle my legs to fit and that was very uncomfortable for a short flight (2+hrs) let alone if we had been on a long flight. Like most economy flights the service and amenities were non-existent. The least they could do is give you a comfortable seat with decent legroom!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Montreal to Las Vegas return. No legroom (I'm only 5'10" average height for a male and my knees were constantly pressed up against seat in front of me). No entertainment on board. No food. Jam-packed plane where they've clearly stuffed in as many seats as possible. Couldn't sleep a lick as no room and seat reclines maybe 4 inches max. Everyone on the plane around us was also complaining of how uncomfortable this flight was. 5.5 hr flight and they made us pay $10 to rent an ipad off them if we wanted entertainment! Avoid at all costs. Not worth the small savings over regular Air Canada service.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Travelled to Canada from Barbados on July 30th didn't have a clue that it would not be an Air Canada flight until couple days before departure when I received an email on this issue. There is no inflight entertainment unless you rent a iPad for CDN$10 the movies are not that up to date either. In the email your are told that if you have an APPLE device (iPadiPhoneiPod) you can go on the app store and download the Rouge app with will allow you to watch the movies on your device. All I can say is what a plug for APPLE. Legroom in economy is poor and the seat is uncomfortable. I booked on Air Canada not Rouge and felt cheated especially as I was travelling with an elderly person and a child. Air Canada needs to inform the public upfront and not after tickets are purchased. I have no expectations that our return flight home will be any different.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flight and crew on flight to/from Toronto to Dublin was very good. Confused though since provided wine free on flight to Dublin but charged on the return leg. Seat was broken (would not lock in upright position). Biggest complaint / issue is that Airline allows carry on baggage regardless of size which jammed up overhead storage. One case had to be removed to close bin and was stored by crew in the back. This should be enforced for comfort of all.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We travelled from Manchester to Las Vegas via Toronto with Rouge. The flight was 3 hours late leaving Manchester and the organisation at Manchester was dreadful. The crew were very kind and understanding but the food was poor and left a lot to be desired. The onward flight to Vegas was fine. The return flight from San Francisco was good but the flight to Manchester was again delayed by 3 hours. We then were informed that two passengers had refused to fly and we had a to wait another 90 minutes while bags were unloaded. It all seemed so laid back. Don't think we will repeat the experience rather go via Heathrow.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew to Orlando from Montreal last February. The seats had very little padding. It was very uncomfortable. The distance between seats was very little causing great discomfort when the seat in front was pushed back. I had to push it forward to get out of the seat. Entertainment was non existent unless you wanted to pay. We took our own food because of previous experience. All in all we would not fly Rouge again. We only fly Air Canada because we have very few options.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Do not take AC Rouge to Costa Rica! We did this last February (2014) and will never use them again. On our return trip to Toronto my husband had broken ribs and the crew did nothing to help make him comfortable. Every time I would ask for a pillow or something - I was basically ignored. They crew felt it better to stand up front and talk amongst themselves. They did not even help him to his seat since he was in a wheel-chair.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Higher priced than competition such as Air Transat Sunwing or Westjet but not much comfort you pay for everything even for blankets. Audio or video is not for anyone anymore. You need an ipad and you receive multimedia via wifi streaming. For half of passengers it does not work because prior to boarding you had to download an app to watch movies and for the other half a good proportion did not use headphones and had their ipads at full volume. People hang their ipads on the seat in front of them and it falls during turbulence not very safe. For legs it is not comfortable. If the passenger in front of you reclines and there is an emergency you're stuck impossible to get out of your seat except if you're a contortionist. Tables are not adapted for North American market if you have a belly something you see more and more in Canada the table rests on your belly and can't be flat. But there are some good points flight attendants are smiling and courteous and the flight went well in general on time. But mainly because the lack of comfort during the whole flight my girlfriend and I will avoid Air Canada knowing that at any moment we can be "Rouged". It sounds like someone found a good way to sabotage Air Canada.

AC 1908 Toronto to Dublin 5/28/14 and AC 1909 Dublin to Toronto 6/6/14. Worst International flight I've ever had and having lived out of the country for 10 years I been on innumerable flights. Seats feel like they were reclaimed off of a discarded school bus. Thinnest I've seen. No leg room and sardines would feel relieved. I'm surprised they didn't charge to turn on the air as they charge for everything else and the chicken didn't even taste like chicken. We were so tired on landing that it ruined the first day in Dublin so no value. I use to live in Canada and thought AC was pretty decent but they really screwed up with this.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have tried Rouge twice. They first time was awful but as always I give everything a second chance. The second time was even worse. There is no leg room at all none. I am 6 foot tall 205 lbs which is average and my knees were almost in my chest. Shame on you Air Canada for doing this. Its impossible for a guy like me to sit in those seats. No entertainment so I stared at the back of my seat for 3 hours. The second time I bought my Ipad and they entertainment was way outdated. Come on air Canada really? I do like the new outfits and younger more pleasant attendants. But my personal experiences are not good. Will avoid them at all costs even if I have to use 2 planes.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
In the middle of a 3-week stay in Barbados. Dread the thought of the trip home. AC Rouge was startlingly inadequate. The tray would not come down when the seat was tilted back. Very cramped. Insult to injury the attendants and the pilot said numerous times "sit back and enjoy the flight. Really! Last time for the Peoples' Airline for me if I can help it.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flight 1914 on May 22 from Toronto to Barcelona / Flight 1915 on June 4 from Barcelona to Toronto. Onboard I began to look for the headphone plug and I was shocked to find out that there is no entertainment system available.…No TV movies or music for a flight that is over 8 hours long. Only option was to rent an iPad and connect to the plane's WiFi but what do you do when you travel with all your family? You rent many iPads? Moreover what happens when your battery is empty again you are left with nothing to do but sit in the uncomfortable limited space that you have. Other bad points for Rouge on the flight back the overhead light was not working so we could not even read a book. Rouge does not offer individual climate control so if you are too hot there is nothing you can do to get a little more air. The crew wasn't so good they seem very disorganized and service was bad. When the meal service got to us we had no choice. We got our beverage long after the meal and again they ran out of a lot of selections. I would accept a lot of those inconveniences for a short/medium length flight but I cannot accept such conditions for long flights. Our experience with Air Canada Rouge was a disaster and I would never recommend Air Canada Rouge to anyone. And I will do all I can to avoid it in the future.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew Air Canada 2 weeks ago (not Rouge) Toronto - Munich on an outbound leg to Athens. While boarding the craft in Toronto was a little disorganized the flight and service was great and the flight would have rated full stars across the board. Our return flight was AC 1901 Athens-Toronto only gets 3 stars for satisfaction as we did arrive safely and on time. That is really the only good thing to be said for it. This was an 11 hour flight through 7 times zones. The flight was half full so staff were not overworked. Unless you pushed the call attendant light they were only in evidence when the very poor meals were delivered (not served). No choice available limited beverage service followed 15 minutes later. One mid-flight trip down the aisle to slide some pretzels and 4 ounces of pop or juice onto your tray and two silent passes of an attendant with a bottle of water and the staff disappeared at least in our cabin. No entertainment available at the seat unless you were willing to pull out a credit card again to rent the airline tablet. The worst of it all was the total lack of comfort provided by the seat. We do not like having the seats in front of us recline so that is not really a problem however the seat design offers no support in the lower back and has restricted both aisle and window passengers from stretching their legs. The arm rest design means that you can inadvertently call the attendant or turn your light on or off. Others have commented on the lack of personal ventilation at the seat so I won't. A mixed blessing was having blankets and pillows provided prior to take-off. At 1pm this seemed a little like telling someone that they are being "put down for a nap". If you don't want them you must give up your limited space to store the items in the event that might want them. On the plus side overhead baggage storage was adequate (however this was not a full flight and might be a problem if fully loaded). Washrooms were adequate but masking tape holding dispensers and bins closed does not inspire confidence. As has become the norm the audio system was poor - either the airline staff need a lesson in microphone use and diction or the system needs an overhaul as most announcements were so "mushy" as to be indecipherable. Finally while we recognize that the airport is responsible at this point the baggage pick-up was a bit of a problem as the overhead monitors specified one carousel but the baggage actually arrived on a different one.

May 30 I left Las Vegas on AC 1854 taking the overnight flight to Toronto. Check in at McCarran was disorganized. Not an auspicious start to my journey. As for the Air Canada Rouge flight I will rate the following aspects as poor: 1) Professionalism: Upon boarding the aircraft I was greeted by the flight attendants with a rather chummy “Hi guys! How was Vegas?”2) Comfort: The seats are now very close together with little or no leg room. 3) In-flight entertainment: Non-existent. I realize that I could have rented an iPad for $10 but why would I want to use something that has been handled by other travellers? This can't be sanitary. 4) Passenger information: The interior cabin lights remained on for the entire flight. I did finally find out why but at the outset no announcement was made by the in-flight crew to explain the situation. This left a lot of passengers both wondering what was going on and feeling very inconvenienced. This was an overnight flight. To leave the lights on (since the reading lights were apparently not operational) in order to allow a few passengers to read is unacceptable. I am looking forward to a return visit to Las Vegas in October. This time I will be taking our two daughters with me. I would not want to subject them to the unacceptable in-flight experience that I experienced with Air Canada Rouge. We will be flying with West Jet. In the future I will never fly Air Canada Rouge again. Lowering service standards is not the way to keep customers. You have lost this one.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew Air Canada Rouge round trip to Dublin in their so called Premium/Business class. While we had executive class check-in the quality that I have come to know in AC Business class stopped there. No access to the lounge or a priority check-in line. The seats were very uncomfortable with very little decline-trying to get some sleep on the over night to Dublin was almost impossible due to the dis-comfort. Breakfast prior to arriving in Dublin was almost non-existent-very poor. On the return flight to Toronto no Cdn newspaper wine served in plastic class did not have the choice of meal I wanted. At least our luggage was first out. I also try to fly AC but in the case of Rouge I will try to avoid it if I have other options available to me.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew on Rouge from Toronto to Montego Bay and back. Great flight attendants and staff. I am a 6ft average male and the seats are slightly more cramped than I'm used to on Air Canada but on my last vacation on Westjets and previously Sunwing are no better or seats were about the same. Flight was on time both ways and I enjoyed the wifi streaming of movies and music on my iPad. Food for sale on board was fresh and lots of choice. Overall I felt very safe and that's the most important thing.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
On May 8 2014 my husband and I boarded AC1894 to Tampa. It turned out to be one of the worst Air Canada flights we have endured. The seats were very uncomfortable and extremely tight. The leg space was so tight in fact that I was not able to open up the in-flight magazine and read it properly. In addition the flight attendants were very young and inexperienced which gave us cause for concern. The French announcements were made by an attendant who was clearly not bilingual as she struggled. The other issue we encountered was the in-accessibility to an entertainment system. The only option is an ITunes system available only to users who operate Apple products. The in-cabin hospitality was terribly slow mostly due to the inexperience of the staff. There was little co-ordination between the food cart staff and the drink cart staff. Consequently we had to wait more than 20 minutes for the drinks to catch up to our meals. To further add to our dissatisfaction the hotel arranged and paid for by Air Canada for the inconvenience of the overnight stay in Toronto was not of a very high standard. The hotel was clearly old and smelled of smoke. The room was very small and the climate control equipment extremely noisy and had to be shut off in order to get any sleep. The main reason for our dissatisfaction is that we had booked Air Canada flights and expected to receive the Air Canada service we were accustomed to and had paid for. We did not select Rouge. Rouge was forced upon us. We were not offered any suitable replacement flights and did not receive any compensation for the loss of services and amenities. In future we will be very strongly considering other airline companies and other options when we fly. Air Canada Rouge will not be an option or a preference again. It is our belief that Air Canada will be losing a lot of customers due to this change.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flight 1901 on June 3rd and I was very disappointed. 1) There was no free entertainment if a passenger did not have their own device for accessing the internet using the plane's WiFi. We were charged $10 CAN to rent an ipad. 2) The overhead reading light did not work for my seat. 3) There was no individual climate control (overhead cool air blower) available in economy class. Therefore I found the cabin temperature quite warm and uncomfortable during my 11 hour flight. 4) The emergency exit lights on the floor which the cabin crew referred to prior to take-off were not apparent. This was cause for concern about our safety in the event of an emergency evacuation. 5) The movie/music selection on the rental iPad was limited and unsatisfactory. 6) No magazines or newspapers were offered to passengers prior to take-off. This was disappointing in view of the long 11 hour flight. 7) The cabin crew were polite but rather unprepared inefficient and immature. They ran out of orange juice while serving beverages and I had to wait until the next beverage run hours later in order to get my beverage of choice. 8) There was no video flight map available on the airplane and the captain failed to provide periodic verbal communication to the passengers regarding our whereabouts. 9) No fresh towelettes were offered to us prior to meals. Thus I was obliged to get up and go to the washroom to wash my hands prior to my meals. This was not ideal given that the cabin crew was in the isles serving passengers. My overall experience was extremely poor and I shall never fly Air Canada Rouge ever again!

I took AC Rouge for the first time yesterday from Dublin to Toronto with my wife and two children. Having read all of the negative comments on this and other sites I was prepared for the worst. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. First class it is not but neither are the fares. Inflight staff were great service was outstanding food was so-so but certainly edible. I have certainly had many better flights but I have had many worse flights as well. They are good value for money and I will fly them again. As for the in flight entertainment we are pretty tech savvy and I like old and obscure films so it was great but it may not suit everyone.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YYZ-LAS return on as part of an AC Vacations package. I'd read the negative reviews online but thought I could suffer the inconvenience for the 4-5 hour flight. Got onboard and was greeted by smiling cheery FA's dressed like they were going to a high school prom as opposed to being professionals but as has been said they were friendly. I managed to squeeze into my seat (15C-aisle) which was not much fun and the plane hadn't even moved yet. I'm 6'3" and even with legs crossed one knee was in the aisle and the other was encroaching into the space of the middle seat. There is no inflight entertainment (IFE) which is fine as I always bring my iPad anyway but to see the FA's trying to flog rental iPads for $10 was in my opinion a bit tacky especially considering the limited numbers. The FA's appeared very young and generally inexperienced. The dreaded return flight home was equally as bad and I was even looking for alternative routings which would allow me to avoid suffering another 4 hours of discomfort and general amateur performance. Unfortunately I was not so fortunate and flew back to YYZ on the 'red eye' departing LAS at 2330Hrs due to delays (flight was due to depart shortly past 2300 hrs). Again the inexperience and amateur behaviour of supposedly trained FA's was on display with one looking as though he'd just spent all night in a casino as he wandered up and down the aisle with a dishevelled uniform tie loosely done and top button open. Once the initial drink service was completed I expected the main cabin lights to be dimmed so people could sleep but no the lights remained ON during the entirety of the overnight flight which I couldn't understand but of course given the rest of the performance it wouldn't have surprised me if the FA's didn't know how to turn down the lights! Overall Rouge is a discount product being offered as a full fare premium product which is wrong on so many levels. I've flown many low cost carriers in various parts of the world and they all share the same features (or lack thereof) as Rouge yet they're openly advertised and priced as 'low cost' and 'no frills' which is something Air Canada is not doing with Rouge. Never again will I fly this pitiful excuse for an airline lack of legroom not withstanding and if Air Canada does not smarten up and listen to its customer base I will be moving all of my business elsewhere.

I booked my daughter and her friend from Toronto to Athens. They were in row 27 Emergency Exit seats. My daughter said it was horrific and never to be repeated. Freezing in the cabin to the degree shivering so hard she couldn't sleep. Served drinks once when took off and once 1 hour prior to landing. No service and she couldn't imagine how much worse it would have been in non-emergency row seats.

AC1914 May 17 2014. Flew from Toronto to Barcelona. A little over 8 hours. The seats were cramped with no legroom. I am 5' 3" 118 lbs and could barely fit. No entertainment unless you had an IPAD. Then you could use their system or rent one for 10 bucks! Asked for a blanket. Another 10 bucks for purchase only. Asked for a glass of wine. Another $6.50! The one meal that we received was horrible. The "snack" was a dry piece of cake.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Took the inaugural flight from Montreal to Athens on a Rouge 767. I was expecting the worst given the extremely bad reviews given here but surprisingly it turned out to be a rather pleasant flight that was pretty much on par with any of the many long-haul AC flights I have taken in the past. Seating and legroom were equivalent to regular AC flights (I am 5 '11") and the food was even a bit better quality (although portions were slightly smaller). Wifi-based entertainment system seems to be Apple-centric and did not work properly with my Android tablet although movies were shown on the overhead screens. Departed from the domestic terminal in YUL which was a bit odd. Based on the other reviews I see I would guess that the experience on the transatlantic flights on the 767 is markedly better than NA flights on the A319.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I travelled to Florida in March and was quite surprised at the services offered by Rouge. I was shocked to think that we had a 3 hour flight with no inflight TV screen to be able to watch movies etc. I detest the assumption that everyone has a device to be able to watch a movie etc. and always considered it part of the entertainment provided on my flight. I had my 90 year old mother with me and she was very frustrated at not being able to watch anything while travelling. If the flights were dramatically cheaper I could understand not having all of the conveniences but we definitely did not pay a cheaper flight. We are giving Air Canada another chance in flying to Las Vegas in July but if we do not have a better experience will reconsider future flying with Air Canada. Based on the reviews that I see here Air Canada better rethink it's Rouge airline set up before it loses all of its customers.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Calgary to Las Vegas direct flight AC1896. Rouge is a clear statement of Air Canada's utter disdain for its 'leisure' traveller. God forbid there is an emergency I fear what might happen due to hampered ability to get in and out of seats with the reduced space - hard to articulate how tight it is but many men had their knees pressed into the seat in front of them and no room to bend over to put their things under front seat. Air Canada charges full AC fares - provides no fare discount to fly Rouge but the experience in every way is to fly a discount airline - but at full AC fare which will ultimately negatively impact their bottom line - despite timing and routing options. The fact that AC flights can be bumped to Rouge makes me hesitant to book AC again - if I pay for a transatlantic business class - a pod - I don't want to be crammed in a small seat -3 per section! Never again will I fly Rouge! One upside - the FAs are in a word sweet.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked a trip to Vegas and thought we were flying with Air Canada until we got our itinerary that said Air Rouge. The airplane itself was run down and dirty. The seats were uncomfortable but thankfully we paid for the exit rows so we had more leg room. The overhead bins are small and you likely won't get 2 roller cases in the bins. We sat in Row 27 A and C on flight 1851 to Vegas and my boyfriend froze the left side of his body on the flight down. The crew seem very disorganized and no one seems to really know what is going on. There would be an announcement in French only and as an Anglophone I have no idea what they were saying so here's hoping it wasn't overly important. During the flight we had some turbulence and the seat belt sign was on but people continued to use the washrooms and the crew allowed them to do so. Don't think they actually have inflight entertainment as this isn't the case. We downloaded the app onto our Ipad and truthfully it was a waste of time. Their idea of inflight entertainment is to allow you to watch 10 mins of a show and then it crashes forcing you to have to log back on and try and find where you were in the show. This happened to us several times and finally we gave up because a 44 min show would have taken us well over an hour to watch and it was frustrating to have to keep logging back in. One gentleman on our flight even returned his $10 Ipad he borrowed as it's a waste of money when the entertainment doesn't work. We have decided that if we can't fly with Air Canada not Rouge then we will book with another airline regardless of price because this was horrible.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
As a long time customer of Air Canada I will now be looking at other airlines for my frequent trips from Vancouver to California. Rouge represents a major drop in quality from Air Canada. There is no entertainment centre and the leg room is the same that I experienced on an Air Transat charter flight when we were packed in like sardines - my knees were touching the seat in front of me. Anyone over 5' 11' is simply not going to fit in the tiny seats. From my perspective this has severely damaged the Air Canada brand and presents a big opportunity for its competitors.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew Rouge from Venice to Toronto on May 25th. The flight had mechanical problems which certainly can't be forecast. Hence we were about 5.5 hours late. The crew was delightful they did what they're supposed to do about the delay. The praise stops there. The seats were unbearably uncomfortable and we were in the Economy Plus section. Our leg room was fine it was the seat itself that was the problem. The poor folks behind us were packed in like sardines. This is the first 767-300 I've ever seen with 53 rows of seats. My wife and I both got swollen legs even though we got up and walked frequently. I don't think we'll choose Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew from Montreal to Nice and then Rome to Montreal. Didn't realize when I booked that Rouge was AC's new discount holiday carrier. My fault. But really shocked at the age of the planes with the old drop down ceiling screens. I knew they had the new inflight streaming entertainment Westjet is going this way too but I didn't realize it was because the planes were so old! Don't think they have been cleaned since they were new either the floors crevices bathrooms walls of both planes were filthy. My seat from Rome was broken and slanted towards the centre. The flight attendants were very sweet all of them barely out of high school. They giggled when they mispronounced words or messed up the announcement. Very cute but wondered who would ever lead whom should an emergency arise. I didn't like my odds. Would not fly Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked a trip to Cancun from Toronto and was surprised to arrive on board and see the business class cabin had been replaced by some awful seats. You no longer get the business class you paid for just a regular economy seat with nobody in the middle. Food and beverages were the same but completely lacking in seat comfort complete bait and switch by Air Canada on this one should have received a refund. Only good thing was I had two tray tables to play with. No IFE either and the streaming they offered the newest movie I could find was Cliffhanger! Truly pathetic.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I was switched to Rouge after booking a business class ticket on a regular Air Canada flight to Phoenix. The Rouge version of business class is shocking. It is the same small uncomfortable seats in economy but they do not book the middle seat. There is little to no overhead storage and people in business class ended up having their bags stored in economy which made disembarking a delayed and frustrating experience. This month Air Canada "rouged" me again by switching a business class flight I had booked to Hawaii. We demanded - and received - a full refund. I will never ever fly Rouge again and I will make every effort to avoid Air Canada in general.

Took 2 trips on Premium rouge (out of necessity not by choice). One was paid as exec ticket YVR to MCO but YYZ to MCO was rouge without notice. Horrid seats. No space.

Recently flew DUB-YYZ return with Rouge. Absolutely awful flight the seats were absolutely tiny the food was intolerable. I wouldn't regard myself as claustrophobic but I definitely felt a little panicky because I couldn't move my legs properly and the seat in front was uncomfortably close to my face. I'd fly with Aer Lingus if I went again or go out of my way to find a connection from another European airport because I definitely couldn't withstand the torture of this trip again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Dangerous lack of legroom. Knees touched back of seat and I am only 5' 8". Could not get my carry-on under the seat because the seats were too close. No wonder they ask people to check their carry-ons. Changed my return flight to another airline. Catering only to Apple products is unfair. Bring back in-flight entertainment centers free movies. Not worth any supposed savings. Will never fly this airline again and I am long time Aeroplan member and always fly Air Canada. Revamp this airline now.

This was my second flight on Air Canada Rouge. Paid J fare for Las Vegas to Toronto in May. Leg room tight no closet for jackets no newspapers meal service all over the map ran out of wine and most disappointing once again the crew was poorly trained although pleasant. The only positive - it was a non stop flight. Will avoid Rouge whenever possible making my overseas loyalty to AC mainline more tenuous.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew from Toronto to Barcelona (Flt 1914) on 5/29. It was the worst (non-weather related) air travel we've ever had. We spent $180 for extra legroom and the seats turned out to be in a bulkhead something we never choose even when free because it's actually less room if you need to stretch your legs. (The bulkhead location had not been shown online during the purchase.) The plane was so cold we used blankets over our overcoats. Somehow the "ice" water and juice we requested were warmer than the plane. We couldn't get comfortable in the seats and couldn't get the air to work. The dinner was barely edible and when breakfast came we did not even open the saran wrapped bagels that felt more like dog biscuits. The flight attendants did not seem to understand they had a responsibility to attend. Beverages were not offered nearly often enough. We had trash on our trays for hours at a time. Bathrooms were littered and had no toilet paper nor tissues. We'll avoid Air Canada Rouge in the future.

Booked on Air Canada only to find out our flight from Toronto to San Diego was switched to Rouge. Too late to change or do anything about it. The seats are awful sitting in the middle seat is torture if you are a bit claustrophobic. Being short I could not even see the flight attendant doing the safety demonstration and of course no entertainment. I don't know if it is another "benefit" of Rouge but you never hear the pilot and you have no idea where your flight is at (no map no screen no communication). When I asked the flight attendant how long until we get to destination it was "like about 2 or 3 hours but I will check". Never heard back from her (it was an hour). I don't know how the AC spokesperson can keep a straight face when she says passengers are happy with Rouge. I guess if they keep saying it they will eventually believe it. I will never fly Rouge again.

Phoenix to Toronto business class May 30th 2014. An absolute insult to people like us who paid for business class. How Air Canada is getting away with this boggles the mind. We have already looked into traveling WestJet for our next trip to PHX. AC will be a last choice from now on - enough is enough. The seats are identical to those in cabin area. Only difference is there are two pillows stacked on the centre seat which makes it unusable. Armrests do not lift either. Tight and very uncomfortable seats. Tray could barely support the weight of my Macbook laptop. These are old planes that are retrofitted. Very young crew did not inspire confidence. Tried telling me my seat # was B25 - I explained that was the Gate #. No beverage cart service. No snacks.

I recently travelled from Toronto to Athens Greece on Air Canada rouge - it was a most unpleasant experience. I would never do it again if I can avoid it! No leg room - could not cross legs. No entertainment features. Bathrooms very dirty after 10 hours.

Booked our trip from the Bahamas to Canada on May 15th from Air Canada. After hearing about Rouge I wondered and checked the reservation. It was Air Canada Rouge where the seats have been taken out replaced with cheaper shorter seats with no inflight entertainment or even a plug and they have added 2 rows. Not wanting to endure that flight with nothing to do I loaded the laptop with stuff to watch. We boarded and found out the man in the window seat had taken my aisle seat. After we fixed that I found out why. He said he had been flying Air Canada for 22 years and had never had that little leg room. After we were in the air I pulled out the laptop case from under my feet and found out I did not have enough room to open it. I slid it into the aisle to open was told not to do that but got the laptop out. I pulled out my tray put the laptop on it opened the laptop to find out there wasn't enough room to open the screen high enough to view it. I am a thin woman so I pulled the tray into my chest and the laptop closer too. That worked and I watched a movie the whole flight. Every time somebody went down the aisle they hit my seat which jabbed the laptop into my chest a bit more. I can no longer fly the real Air Canada to the Bahamas WestJet flies there too and they have normal legroom and inflight entertainment.

Have been a long time supporter of AC but after this first experience flying Rouge I will avoid it at all cost unfortunately still have my return ticket. I always appreciated that even in normal economy AC provided reasonable room in seating - today my knees were pressed against seat in front of me and then the person in front of me reclined their seat to allow me to get to know my tray table on a very intimate basis. Lack of services in flight just gave everything a very cheap feeling - except when I looked at the fare I paid I realized not all was "cheap". Time to stop worrying about accumulating points and start looking for a better airline choice. Found it interesting that they switched me from regular AC to Rouge on my Toronto-Phoenix flight the sent email saying we understand people are unhappy and if you contact us you can get your money back in full - no questions! Makes me think I am not the only one and even AC knows deep down they haven't got it right.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I needed to fly to Orlando for a conference May 16 2014 and booked on Air Canada Rouge because it was the only option on the day/time I needed to fly. I was not aware that Rouge was the new "vacation line" the term the flight crew used when I expressed astonishment at the lack of personal entertainment systems. As a business traveler I expect better options and was unhappy with the (lack of) comfort in the cramped seats the lack of power at the seats the slow food/beverage service due to the first 70 minutes of service dedicated to renting the i-Pads for movie/Wi-Fi. The crew were very attention and pleasant which was a nice surprise from the usual variable AC crew. Regretfully crew alone will not get me back on a Rouge flight unless there are absolutely no other options.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
LAS-YYZ: tight seats had an aisle seat and had to keep my legs in the aisle as there was no space in my seat (for a 6 foot guy). I don't know how long Air Canada will be able to get away with this but I will do everything in my power to avoid Rouge. Overpriced cramped and minimal value for money.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We were jammed in like cattle on flights from Montreal to Orlando return on Air Canada Rouge. Legroom was substandard. You pay substantially less to fly on Sunwing and Ryanair for this type of service so why is Air Canada allowed to sell regular priced tickets for Sunwing and Ryanair type service.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Decided to visit Toronto and Vancouver for a month. Wanted to miss London so agent found us a direct flight from Dublin to Toronto as leg one of the trip. Got tickets. Later that day the flight was cancelled. A week later flight re-instated. Two days before leaving flight time delayed two hours. On arrival at airport flight again delayed 1.5 hours. Lots of jollity singing dancing and dignitaries to launch this 'NEW ROUGE' enterprise. We the passengers not involved totally ignored if the truth be known after 'another' hour the flight finally takes off - 4 hours and 20 minutes after the time we booked. As so many others have said the crew were officious and diffident the food was worse than poor no entertainment even though we had bought an 'Android' tablet for the trip so we had 7 hours and 20 minutes of utter boredom. Couldn't read either none of my armrest lights worked.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
AC booked ticket got changed to Rouge with loss of seat selection. Seats were very small and uncomfortable. Staff on the flight down did manage to serve the entire cabin but did not offer iPads for rent to anyone in economy. On the return flight there was no food stocked. Staff appear to be uncoordinated amongst themselves to get the service completed or attend to passengers needs.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Calgary to LAX: 45 min delayed departure due to some issue with a seat belt poor flight attendant service (last 10 rows did not appear to get served beverages due to poor coordination between attendants) little leg room. To top it all off this flight was originally booked with Air Canada (with advance seat selection included). Our flights were switched by AC to Rouge and they would not honour our original seat reservations. As we were traveling with a disabled adult and wanted to sit together we had to pay AC another $208 (4 seats - 2 flights) to get confirmed seats. On the return flight (LAX to Calgary) our Rouge flight (along with another Rouge flight) was cancelled due to "engine problems". Imagine that two flights within hours of each other both with engine problems! AC did give us breakfast vouchers but also promised lunch vouchers once we were through security. Unfortunately after that point no body at AC knew anything about lunch vouchers. The only good thing about this whole sorry episode was the replacement plane was not a "Rouge" plane. It had decent leg room and in flight entertainment. AC also mysteriously credited back $104 to my mastercard. Could it be they felt guilty about charging me for seat selection on the return flight (seats that I had when I originally booked this trip)?

I booked 2 tickets from Montreal to Las Vegas in business class and paid more than $ 5000. I was seated in the first row and have never had so little leg room in any airline including economy class. I moved to a back seat during the flight and I had more room than where I was seated. No place to put my jacket no place to .ut my carry on as first four bins were full with Air Canada equipment. No entertainment screen. They give you an Ipad so you can watch 15 year old movies. No place under my seat to store my computer. The flght attendant took it away during takeoff and landing and I had to ask to get it back after take off. The tray in the first row is very small and no place to put a glass. A passenger to my right spilled his coffee twice. Very inexperienced staff. She spilled water on me and no excuses. He would serve men before women. My travelling companion received a wet towel but not me or at least 5 other travelers in business class. The toilets at the front were available to everyone on the plane. I asked to hang my jacket and they told me that they do not have any room and to put in on the middle seat. When you book a seat in business class you expect quality and comfort. The way I see it I ended up paying $ 3000 for our two meals.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
For a transatlantic flight it was not up to par. Many have complained about the seats. That isn't my biggest complaint. It is the overhead compartments - they are undersized. You cannot fit 2 standard carry-on sized bags inside them. I had to place mine about 8 rows back. The lack of decent entertainment/info system is wanting. Unless you have a mobile device and previously uploaded the player app you will need to rent an ipad. I was pleasantly surprised that despite the notice saying that there is no power supply for devices I did find there was one. The notice recommended having your ipad/mobile fully charged prior to boarding but even so I don't know of any device that can last 6+ hours. I know Air Canada is often criticized for poor service and Rouge is not helping their reputation.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Montreal to Las Vegas. Many passengers I saw had tags on bags showing they were Elite status or higher. This was my first experience with Rouge and I will do everything I can to make sure it's my last. The comments noted by so many; cramped seating non existent inflight entertainment etc don't need to be repeated again. The level of frustration shown by most passengers who flew on Rouge shows such a blatant disregard for passenger comfort that it makes one ashamed to call this our Legacy airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Montreal to Athens and returned Athens to Toronto. The airfare was the same as my Air Canada flight to Athens the year previous so there was definitely no savings. Instead for the same price I was herded into a Boeing 767 that should have retired from service 10 years ago. Dingy is all I have to say. I am horrified that Air Canada is now replacing all of its mainline flights between Vancouver and Los Angeles with Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I got switched to Rouge on a Barbados to Toronto 6 hour flight without warning. The lack of entertainment was not an issue for me as I prefer to read but the seat size (I am quite small) is not acceptable for a long flight. My other complaint is that the Caribbean is not considered International and therefore meals are not served!! Purchased meals are unpalatable! I am a senior who has travelled Air Canada (and TCA before) all her life but will definitely be looking for alternatives.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
When people book Air Canada flights and pay full price they should be told that they will be flying Rouge so that they have the choice to decline. The seats were very uncomfortable there was no TV and the plane really looked decrepid. The flight attendants seemed to just be an extension of the the whole sad situation. I have flown Air Canada since the 50's and was always proud of our Canadian airline. I find it a shame that we do no longer compete with other fine airlines of the world. From now on unless it is an extreme emergency I will never fly Air Canada again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I was on an Air Canada Rouge flight from Venice to Toronto May 2014. The plane had no TV's and customers are expected to download an air Canada app in advance to their own smart phones i pads etc. They rent ipads for those without their own. The stewardess spent much of of the trip trying to trouble shoot problems with access to the system. Most people gave up and spent 10 hours with nothing to watch. That makes for a very long flight and makes the assumption that everyone is travelling with such a mobile device and wants to watch tv on their phone screen. This is not good customer service for such long flights. Also unless you had accessed the app before your flight it would not run movies or TV shows. Despite over an hour delay taking off in Venice to Toronto no Air Canada rep bother to advise travellers to download it in advance from the Venice airport internet service. Also there are no "new releases" in the movie options. The movies are "classics" and as old as the ruins in Rome. The flight was late back into Toronto and we were given incorrect info from the crew as to the gate for our flight connection in Toronto and we had to complete our journey standby.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I paid for an Air Canada fare from Halifax to Barbados. Toronto-Barbados portion was on Rouge. What a horribly plane. Luckily even with our flight almost full there was no one in the center seat. I am 6ft 1in I had to have my left leg over in the middle seat and my right leg into the aisle to get any measure of comfort and needless to say that was uncomfortable for 5hrs 45 mins. It actually made more sense for me to stand up during the flight. And the lack of individual monitors? Renting iPAds to watch movies? That's a curse in itself. The staff tried to be very helpful but how can they help you get more room when there is none.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I am only 5'8" and my knees touched the seat in front. Anyone 5'10" or over will not be able to fit in these seats without angling their legs. Staff young and friendly but inexperienced and their cavalier attitudes did not sit well after being cramped for a few hours. I purchased AC flights but was "Rouged" with no compensation. Air Canada was really improving the last few years and has taken a huge turn for the worse.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I booked a ticket from Calgary to Anchorage with a stopover in Vancouver and like many other commentators on here got my flight switched from Air Canada to Rouge to Anchorage (YVR-ANC). Fortunately I was sitting in the "bulkhead row" of economy otherwise my knees would have been going into the seat in front me. On both the flight there and back (3 hours) the flight attendants came through once to serve drinks and offer food. I found their cheery attitude even more annoying given that the service they gave was subpar. When I checked in they had an offer to "upgrade" to premium rouge on this flight for $300 (which I did not opt to do). You get more leg room and 2 free checked bags but that's about it since the seats are as narrow as economy. Getting free cheap booze and an okay meal is not worth that kind of money.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
As someone who is over 6 feet and 220 pounds the only word I can use to describe Air Canada Rouge seating is inhumane. I can live with wireless movies no meals and pay for baggage but I do need a seat I can sit in without skinning my knees. I can honestly say Rouge seating is the worst I have had to endure.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Great vacation except we were put on Air Canada Rouge flights by Air Canada (Toronto-cancun and back)- even though our original booking was on Air Canada. We were not given a choice or told of the change or what the change would mean (and it did not equate to any kind of discount). I have never been so cramped on a plane - I'm only 5'5" and my knees touched the back of the next chair when it was reclined - I couldn't lift my purse from under the seat in front (and bags bigger then a purse will not fit under the seat). My husband is 5'10 and couldn't fit his legs in front of him so had to encroach on my space. The person to my left was over 6' and also encroached on my space - claustrophobic. The first thing the flight attendant said to me as I reached my seat was "do you like the legroom" and laughed. One of the bathrooms was out of order for the flight. There are no movies unless you purchase a tablet for $10. We didn't try any of the purchased food so can't comment about it. Added to all this - originally we booked a 2 hour layover back from Mexico in Toronto to have time make it through customs and having to go through security again before connecting flights (sadly happens at TO airport)- our "itinerary" change to a rouge flight lowered this to not much more than an hour. Flight crew very friendly and young and inexperienced. This has put a very bad taste in our mouth re: Air Canada who we have flown dozens of times with in the past. We mentioned it on our air Canada trip home and it seems that others feel the same.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I've been Rouged! Low cost really? I paid for an AC flight and got Rouged. I didn't receive any refund as it was the the same price as an AC flight. Business class is a joke. Don't waste your money as the only difference is you get 2 checked bags and a meal. Seats are 3x3 with no one in the middle. Why put the 3rd seat in? Entertainment is worse than before. I have 2 more flights that have been Rouged and then never again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I just flew Rouge for the first and likely the last time YUL- CAN. The first thing you notice are the seats. I am 6'0" tall and found the seats to be very cramped uncomfortable and claustrophobic. If the person in front of you chooses to recline your eye-to-seatback distance becomes very small. This situation may be barely tolerable for flights under 2 hrs but for the 4.5 hrs to CAN it was tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment. The next thing you notice is that there is no traditional entertainment system. It is WiFi only and currently appears limited to iPad and some Windows devices. I have an Android tablet and therefore was not able to access their movie selection. What is surprising here is that an entertainment system that is designed around a bring-your-own-device concept provides no AC or USB access to power/charge your device. You also notice the "fun" attitude of the crew seems forced and disingenuous.

I travelled on AC/Rouge inaugural flight 02 May Dublin/Toronto in economy class. Much to my surprise this was on a new B767 My first class seat got transferred to Air Canada Rouge version of first class from Los Angeles to Vancouver BC which is a joke. This was done without my permission and without refunding any difference. They have 3 economy seats in the first class cabin on either side of the aisle and just do not sell the middle seat. The seats are narrow and uncomfortable. I feel like they are cheating first class passengers by selling economy seats in "first class". They provided a meal but that hardly covers the $500 plus cost difference from an economy seat.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My wife and I were on AC 590 from Phoenix to Toronto May 5 when we were told at check in that there were aircraft problems. Much later it came out that the plane was inoperable but instead of another AC plane they had to find a Rouge plane-which they did in San Diego so it went to Toronto then Phoenix so a 10 hour delay for us. The ground crew said they have fielded nothing but complaints since Rouge started. This was just the latest. I am a million mile for life AC client and my wife is super elite for the last 3 years. The Rouge experience is bad - no leg room limited overhead baggage room (more people same space) no entertainment system and every flight we have been on leaves late. It is the overhead baggage that creates the problems. At one point Rouge did not allow the same aeroplan point saving until clients complained and it was changed. Whoever came up with this concept did not consider their current clients. The price of tickets is the same and now Westjet will fly from Toronto to Phoenix beginning in the fall and they will take AC customers for sure. Rouge started with the short hauls and leg room can be tolerated for 2 hours but now they are on long hauls. Dressing the crew in designer clothing will not overcome these issues and in fact this situation is not fare to these staff and ground personal that are handling these complaints.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Last week I flew Air Canada Rouge for the first time not realizing the difference from Air Canada when I made the booking. The leg room is absolutely ridiculous. I took a picture while seated. My hand reached from my seat to the one in front of me and I don't have big hands. Service was lackadaisical. I asked for coffee but was told it couldn't be served as the seat belt sign was on which is understandable. On "real" Air Canada flights this has happened to me and the flight attendant has brought coffee once the light goes off but not on Rouge. Rouge is not recommended unless the price is really great.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
LAS-YYC. I never brought my iPad and it would not have mattered due to the fact that the system didn't function. I was travelling on my own on this trip but had I had my children it would have been even worse. We travel quite frequently but only have 1 iPad so I guess we will have to rent them now for the rest of the family. I also see we can't use them for the first 20 mins or the last 20 mins either. Why bother to watch a movie on a 2-3 hr flight as you would never get to see it all. No more place to charge devices either. Air Canada had a pretty good thing going and now it has taken a turn for the worse again. Whom ever thought up Rouge was obviously not the sharpest knife in the drawer. These types of major changes should have been piloted properly and reviews taken seriously. Very disappointed!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Awful customer service. The flight attendants care more about talking to each other than taking care of customers. Don't expect much water service -- expect to be dehydrated. There is a war at the gate over luggage due to the cramped seating - expect a lot of airline staff to be yelling at you. Seating is cramped awful uncomfortable. Avoid this airline.

I travelled on AC/Rouge inaugural flight 02 May Dublin/Toronto in economy class. Much to my surprise this was on a new B767 with wingtips and a good crew and the food was good too except for those awful wraps on the second meal service. Seating was normal and didn't feel cramped. The crew were fun and always around to help. The problems with Rouge seems to be on the A319 domestic/transborder flights as I have nothing to complain about on the B767 International flights.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
These seem to be very old aircraft repainted though refurbished with the slim line seats which are perfect for slim line passengers - which I am not even though only 5'3" my knees are touching the seat in front. In the washrooms the doors still had an old metal ashtray. Crew is apparently paid to smile and be friendly. But after a half hour sitting on the runway they disappear and reappear when it's time to sell the $10 chicken wraps. I don t mind getting a low-cost carrier but if I don't get the low cost what is the use?

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My husband and I planned a nice trip to Cuba with Air Canada Vacations - Toronto to Varadero and back in March. Everything was great - except for the flights on AC Rouge. We are both tall and were hideously cramped in the tiny Rouge seats. The food was expensive and terrible if I'd known how bad it was I would have taken my own. Both flights were crammed and on the way back we were not seated together and were seated in the middle of a huge group of high-school students. Fortunately the kids were pretty well-behaved. I am now going to Las Vegas and my flights have been Rouged even though we thought we were going with the real Air Canada. I am a frequent flyer and will stick with AC because I like the lounge and use the points - but they are going to hear from me about Rouge. As others have said it's a bait-and-switch. The late NationAir was better than Rouge - and they were awful!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Barbados on May 12th. The worst flight of my life! I am only 5'2" and I have to say it was tight for me. The seats recline about 4 inches in total. When the person in front of my seat reclined the back of the seat was in my face! I felt sorry for the fellow in the window seat who was over 6' tall. I really don't know how he managed for the 5hr plus flight. His legs were stretched out the entire time so that he could fit into the seat. 2 guys behind me were hacking and coughing for the entire flight (not the fault of Rouge - but they should have worn masks or not be allowed on the plane). The staff was great and were cheerful throughout the entire flight. The overhead luggage bins are smaller than those on other planes. Then I discovered one of the reasons the bin space was further limited was that the crew had at least 3 of their bags in the bins so the paying customers had even less space for their items. I hope that reviews like this will be taken into consideration and that Rouge is not used on flights to Barbados. Also the seats were hard and uncomfortable. For 2 days since the flight my back and neck have been in a terrible state. I will not fly Air Canada again between Barbados and Toronto until more comfortable planes are in use.

They are now the only AC option from Calgary to Vegas which I fly 6 to 8 times a year. Awful experience with Rouge on my last and hopefully only flight with them (Westjet here I come). I am only 5' 7" and my knees were just about touching the back of the seat in front of me. I did bring my fully charged ipad to view the entertainment. Unlike regular AC flight which offer the latest movies the selection consisted of old movies most of which I had already seen. The image was often grainy reflecting the poor streaming quality of the WIFI. Staff extremely young and inexperienced and no i do not need their false cheeriness!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Reserved and paid for regular Air Canada round trip Toronto to Puerto Vallarta last year for travel this April. Wound up on Rouge with a person with a dog in a carrier under the seat next to me. This left no space for the passenger's legs so he took part of my space which was tight enough already. When I politely asked for another seat I was told there were none. I walked the length of the plane and there were seats at the back. No entertainment tablets for $10 that did not work mushy sandwich and knees in my back. Thanks but no thanks - no more Air Canada for me. Rouge me once but not twice.

My flight was changed to Rouge. I didn't have enough leg room seats were horrible and when I put my tray down it was so tight it touched my stomach. I have been a supporter of Air Canada but I have had enough. Flying another airline now. Will never touch an air Canada flight again. If you want to feel what a sardine feels like in a can fly Air Canada Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Rouge is a great disappointment. Air Canada has labelled it as a "leisure" airline which is code for poor service cramped seating space and price gouging. The number of "Air Canada" flight routes are rapidly dwindling with the carrier moving routes to Rouge service. Last week I flew Toronto return to Tampa. The seating pitch is cramped. The passenger next to me continually had their head in my lap while trying to access their under seat storage. When the passenger in front fully reclined their seat I briefly thought about offering them money to return their seat back so that I could have a few more inches of space. The entertainment system is not well thought out. Passengers on both my flights were not using headphones to watch their devices. Volume levels were on high to compete with the jet noise and their hearing aids. With the in-flight entertainment system headphones are required to access the entertainment sound. None of the flight attendants addressed the lack of headphone use issue but instead preferred to ignore it. The entertainment selection on the Rouge app is not appealing. Very sad is that the cost to fly Rouge in May was more than 40% higher than to fly Air Canada less than a year ago with the same advance booking time. I will not fly Rouge again.

I recently used the last 2 credits of my Air Canada Sunpass (YUL-LAS) that I purchased in August 2013 fully Decided to take Air Canada Rouge to Orlando from Winnipeg. The only problem we needed to get to Toronto. No big deal since Air Canada flies out of that city. Well a typical Air Canada flight was then met with a fresh and fun flight on Rouge to Orlando. Inflight entertainment was easy to use and reliable. Young hardworking staff. Both pilots stood at the front and said goodbye to passengers something you don't always see. Was it cramped - not really as I'm 6'1 and was able to stretch my legs beneath the seat.

I recently used the last 2 credits of my Air Canada Sunpass (YUL-LAS) that I purchased in August 2013 fully expecting the full J experience I had paid for. Took the first return flight in September and it was the mainline perfect. Then my route got Rouged. Had 4 credits left and I got to be the guinea pig on one of the very first Rouge flights to LAS. Late broken plane. Inexperienced crew. IPADs didn't work. Then they did. Saw the selection and was wishing it didn't work again. Service was poor to passable seats were broken. Lumpy metal boxes blocking the under seat space for feet or bags. I just used my final 2 credits a few days ago and expected some kinks to be worked out nope same crummy IFE.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Toronto to Las Vegas with Air Canada Rouge. Didn't realize when booking that this was the new discount airline. Had to pay $25 each each way to check a bag. When we got to the airport flight was delayed by an hour due to issues with the plane. Kept announcing more and more delays. Flight crew showed up then left. When our plane was finally ready to go no one could get a hold of the crew had to wait another 10 minutes for them to show up. Carry-on compartments were small attendants spent forever trying to rearrange them to fit everyone's bags. Maybe if checked bags were free people wouldn't be trying to cram so much into their carry-ons? Seats were cramped no TV screens at all. You can download an app for your iPad to watch movies which they tell you about on the plane (app has to be downloaded before boarding). Or you can rent one of Air Canada's iPads for $10. Food was awful not worth the $30 it cost. Usually like Air Canada but will never fly with Air Canada Rouge again.

Worst flying experience in a very long time. Flew AC Rouge back from Vegas to Calgary. First irritant was paying to have my bag checked. Apparently because I was flying on airmiles I couldn't check in online. Got to the check in area at airport and the desk clerks were insistent I use self check in which didn't work properly for us so eventually they let me (and my party of 5) check in at the counter. If I wanted to change seats they were going to charge me $25 per seat (by the way these are all things that another airline provides free of charge). No entertainment system other than their "rent an ipad" system I tried to connect my tablet as they indicated with free wi-fi but because I had not pre loaded some app it did not work. Glad I did not rent an iPad for $10 because they only passed them out nearly an hour into the flight and collected them an hour prior to landing (which left less than an hour for viewing). Leg room is a bit of a joke and the speaker system above my head nearly blew my eardrums out which was more than just a small irritant. Oh yes nearly forgot to mention that for no explained reason they changed the time of my flight to more than one hour earlier. I will do everything in my power to avoid flying this airline in the future. I think it might be time to trade in my Aeroplan miles for some other rewards.

Earlier this year I bought a flight pass (an 8 flt SunPass to be used from YYC-LAS) all the flight were AC. My first return booking with my flight pass my trip there is AC with all the regular amenities - and leg room. My trip back however was on Rouge and all further flights on the pass look to be Rouge as well. I am tall 6'2" and I actually "upgraded" to Rouge Premier which is their version of Business Class. My knees still touched the seat in front of me and the seats were no wider. Still 3x3 in "Business Class" upfront so if you pay for an upgrade (I used points) be very careful as you can still get a middle seat. Still the same as the back no power no entertainment. but they do offer an iPad with the App pre-loaded which still makes me shake my head. No real place to put it with the exception that it came with a cover and you could sort of hang it from the seat back in front of you where in other airlines the entertainment was supposed to go. Two problems with this. 1) the earphone cable has to stretch over the tray and if you're using that for a drink or food the risk of knocking something off of that with the earphone cable rises sharply and of more concern 2) if the plane hits some unexpected turbulence all of a sudden you've got iPads flying everywhere - at least far more than you would on an AC flt. All this aside I still felt like I've paid for an 8 pass with an AC and got a 'bait and switch' to Rouge with no options. Some of us have to travel (it's not for vacation) and when we do and have paid for and expected a certain level of service (which I felt was fair and competitive with AC) and suddenly you are still paying the same price but the level of service comfort and even safety has dropped dramatically I can't feel but that I got bait and switched.

April 24 AC 7971. It is hard to imagine what management thinks about when they make decisions totally focused on the bottom line rather than customer service. So with service now inferior flight comfort at an all time low then why use AC? I was loyal but no longer. After a series of awful trips horrible service and basically no compensation then I will now be an airline shopper. I get they want to make money and I support that but Service and Comfort are what count. Rouge is just awful it is like a charter flight with higher prices. Plus with no entertainment unless you have an Apple device they don't tell you that so I wasted a few hours trying to download their entertainment onto my PC laptop. Worked out better as I spent the time reading. They launch this ridiculously confusing distinction program which I still have no idea what it is for! PS if you are going to Europe try Swiss or Lufthansa both offer great service and comfort.

I have not boarded my Rouge flight yet that will be this Thursday. I am not looking forward to it after reading the above comments. I looked at prices from the Bahamas to Toronto in March and wondered why after mid April prices increased. I finally booked the flight I'm leaving on. I could have left April 17th for 240 Canadian but it was too cold in Ontario to go back. Now we are paying 271.05 each to return on a less than comfortable flight. I will see how it is but just losing the entertainment part is annoying. Does AC think we all have I-pads and i- phones? I will be flying Westjet from now on. Air Canada not one dime of taxpayer money do you get for wrecking your own business.

Purchased Business Class Toronto to Las Vegas horrible surprise. Very uncomfortable. We had to hold iPads to watch the entertainment. Staff advised to hang on headrest in front of us. iPad fell and spilled drinks several times. Paid for business class for extra comfort very surprised of smaller seat than usual Air Canada business class.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew from Jamaica on a Boeing 767 good headroom pleasant crew but horrible placing of the 'press for service button' on the armrest meant constant and irritable sounds of sometimes very loud multiple alarms going off. Even the crew were upset and they had to put up with it going and coming! If you can fly a different airplane I will definitely avoid the 767s.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
After booking my flight to Disneyland in August 2013 we had a fabulous vacation. Tired and hungry we (the group of 9 of us) boarded our flight in LA to Vancouver with a dead cell phone fully anticipating being able to charge it on the plane. To my surprise the flight had no way of charging my phone nor did we have video to occupy our 3 hour long flight with our knees in the back of the seats of other unlucky passengers in front of us. My 9 year old son also had his knees touching the seat in front of him and a seat in the face as the other uncomfortable passenger tilted their seat back in hopes of finding some extra space. The flight crew were insistent on asking us how we were enjoying the flight numerous times. It got annoying. Fortunately we had bought snacks to prepare us for the dinner we would miss during the flight and thankful we did because we weren't even offered so much as a bag of peanuts. As we were flying internationally we needed to fill out declaration cards. Someone didn't stock them on the flight so we had to fight our way through the small table outside of customs to fill out our declaration cards. This could have occupied some of the boring time we spent on the flight looking at the obvious hole in the seats where the video consoles had been removed. The good news was it gave us a great place to put our hands on so we could attempt to nap on our forearms. Oh and to hold onto when we landed. Fortunately we had wifi for our ipad! This was a saving grace - we tried to connect no luck. This was when they came over the system to proudly tell us we could use the wifi for free and hopefully we had previously downloaded their app to view inflight movies. Much to our surprise the wifi would only work within their app. But no worries we could pay 10.00 to use a complimentary ipad that had said downloaded app on it. I had never heard of Rouge before but I do now. I suggest you do not fly them. If I wanted to fly in a cattle car I would have booked through a cheaper carrier. Shame on you Air Canada! Shame on you!

Air Canada 1873 April 22nd. Lousiest airline I have ever been on. Extremely small spaces between rows. Flight attendants cannot even speak French properly they all seem like they just got out of high school very non- professional staff. Will never fly Air Canada again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Brand new "Rouge" - I am a frequent flyer with Air Canada but was "forced" onto their new "Rouge" service on a recent pleasure trip to Cuba. Flew "Rouge" Montreal-Holguin on May 1 return on May 8. Connected each way to YVR on regular AC. Massively unhappy with Rouge. Pretty new exterior paint odd uniforms (what were you thinking?) but the bottom line is AC is forcing people to use Rouge and it is just a "bait and switch". Crew were pleasant and flights on time - but this trip was charter by another name! Seat pitch very poor seats thin and anything happening in seat pocket behind ands up communicated to your lower back. The "entertainment" system (bring your own tablet or rent one for $10.00 from them. I had pre-loaded their required software and it worked perfectly on way down but on way back - failed and failed (same for man next to me). Crew suggested I needed newer software (hey it was new and worked 7 days previously). Next time if they force (and they do) Rouge on me - I am switching to a different charter airline (for that is what Rouge is - it is a bait and switch) for lower service levels - lack of comfort (oh and no business class cabin not even premium economy). I am retired and felt beat-up on this trip. Not happy. Better of with a "real charter" - next time I will avoid anything "Rouge".

### Air Canada rouge customer review
A new expression for airline travel! We have been "rouged". My husband is a very frequent flyer (Elite status) and always tries to use Air Canada. We flew AC May 1 YVR-MON-Holguin (return on 8th). The Vancouver-MON were fine (usual economy with Air Canada). Rouge is horrible Seats are jammed in like Sunwing or similar seats too thin and you spent hours being nudged and bumped by any movement behind you food not good (as usual) but worst is the "entertainment" system. You bring your own and we did - our iPad all pre-loaded as they asked worked one way but not on return. Crew were polite but suggested our operating system needed updating (in a week). Never again. There is no price advantage there was no premium economy sets are very cheap and above all Air Canada is trapping it's loyal customers into this trick.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked two economy tickets on Air Canada in April 2013 to fly to Grenada from YYZ and paid over $1000 per ticket for a flight in March 2014. Paid extra for bulkhead seats. Air Canada switched flights to Rouge without even notifying us and gave away the seat selection we had paid extra for. Not only that but they changed from flying on Saturdays to Mondays. The seat pitch on Rouge flights is 29". This is one of the lowest in the airline industry. To add insult to injury they awarded us a fraction of the Aeroplan points because the flight was operated by Rouge and not Air Canada. Wish there was a star rating for 0.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Never again. After so many years of loyalty but now feel completely "rouged". There is no deal there are no option on routes - its Rouge or nothing. Business class is a joke! 9 hours waiting for a plane to arrive because they could not substitute with regular AC fleet. So why not inconvenience passengers who paid the same price as AC fares and then refuse to post comments on their website. Goodbye Rouge Hello Westjet!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
What a ripoff! Had business class seats but ended up flying Rouge from Orlando to Toronto in their so-called "premium" seats. What a joke not even close to business and only marginally better than the horror story that was economy class. Crowded rushed and rude attendants. I learned a lesson here - to stay away from Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My sister and I decided to go to Barbados for Easter. Booked business class. We were very shocked when we got on the plane and saw what Rouge defines as business class. Paid the same price as a regular Air Canada business ticket but definitely did not feel that we were flying business. Staff were young and trying their best but could not pacify the unhappy passengers in "business class". I decided to make the best of it but its difficult to enjoy your flight when everyone around you is so angry. The iPad we were given was a joke! Movies were not even close to be current releases. Every time I paused the movie I was forced back to the beginning. Very frustrating. I think the worst part was the passengers from economy coming up to "business class" to use the lavatory. I had an aisle seat with people from the back of the plane forming a line beside me. If I wanted people to hover around me I would have booked economy. When I asked the attendant if they should be up here she said no but did nothing about it. The attendants had no control over the situation. We were in the last row of "business" on the way home and had the first row economy person constantly pushing on my seat. Again this is something you expect in economy class. It was a long flight which I usually don't mind when I am sitting in business. But this is not business! I am very hesitant to book Air Canada ever again as I am afraid that it will be another Rouge flight.

May 5 return from Phoenix. What's the value proposition for the customer. I still can't get an answer. We just spent 10 hours in the Phoenix spirit because of a Rouge malfunction with the plane coming from Toronto. Because it's Rouge and not Air Canada they had to wait for a Rouge plane coming from San Diego. We got this great service. Poor legroom and no inflight entertainment and at the same normal Air Canada fare. I'm a long time super elite. Westjet will be flying Toronto - Phoenix. Why wouldn't I fly that way in the future. I am so so disappointed.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
26 Aug AC1924. 2 Sep AC1925. Flew to Costa Rica could not wait to get off that plane. Staff were too young inexperienced and rude. Forget service it was as if you were bothering them if you asked for anything. No in- flight entertainment unless you provided your own unfortunately if your computer iPad etc ran out of power there are no outlets for charging your equipment. Was planning a trip to Ireland with AC and once we found out it was with Rouge the 5 of us are now going to fly Westjet. On future trips will still fly AC but will not fly Rouge again nor will I book clients on Rouge flights. Sorry Rouge gave you a fair shot and you failed so badly I can not give you another chance unless you drastically lower your prices to match what you offer.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew from Phoenix to Toronto this week on Rouge. Boarding was delayed as the staff spent at least a half hour trying to get passengers to check their carry ons due to the fact that the Rouge planes have a much smaller overhead bin. That's not the only thing that is smaller and uncomfortable. The seats are tight (this says a lot coming from someone who is 5' 3") the entertainment choices are dated/if they work staff are young and inexperienced service was disorganized and slow. We will do anything we can not to take a Rouge flight ever again. I understand that they might want to offer a lower priced alternative to travellers but there are no deals on their flights compared to their previous Air Canada flights. We're stuck with this as the only option until Westjet begins their service YYZ to PHX - with luck this fall. Can't imagine who thought this would be a good idea - whoever it was should be made to sit in a middle seat for a 5 hour flight and rethink all that Rouge has to offer.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
On May 1st my wife son and I were on the inaugural Rouge flight from Toronto to Dublin with regular flights from Edmonton to Toronto. We booked last summer and knew the flight would be on Rouge and the price seemed to be OK. Interestingly our daughter and her boyfriend later booked on regular Air Canada through London and paid over $100 each less than us. There goes the low cost airline unless low cost means low cost for the airline which translates into rip off for the customer. The plane we travelled on was a Boeing 767. The plane we originally boarded had a broken windshield wiper and therefore had to be abandoned in favor of a second plane. This delayed our departure by over two hours. We were seated in economy class. Looking at the six abreast "premium class" seats my wife and I were glad we hadn't paid for an upgrade. The economy class seats are very slim and rows are close together. This might be ok for short flights of up to three hours but nothing to look forward to for a transatlantic flight. Further the seats hardly recline at all. Lacking blankets and pillows good luck for some sleep and welcome to aches and pains arriving in Dublin. Entertainment is via WiFi through iPads or lap top computers with flash player. No option for Android devices. Anyway I could not get it to work on my computer. $5 saved. The cabin crew was young and inexperienced in silly uniforms. Food quality was airline minus minus. A free soft drink was provided but alcoholic beverages had to be paid for (free on my daughter's cheaper regular Air Canada flight). All together Air Canada Rouge is a rip off approaching Ryan Air quality. At least Ryanair is open about its cattle truck approach. After having failed with two attempts at budget airlines what is Air Canada thinking? I expect Rouge to die and unceremonious death - the sooner the better.

AC1760 Toronto to Holguin Cuba March 16 2014. Return flight AC1761 March 23. Booked an Air Canada Vacations package to Cuba. I would generally use ACV because service tended to be a bit better than other vacation companies. I guess those days are gone. The flight was terribly uncomfortable. Seat padding is thin inadequate leg room (I'm 6'3") no entertainment unless you own or rent an ipad and all this for the price of a regular flight. I'll be looking for other options from now on.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Only problem I had with the plane was the seats. The entertainment was poor but it didn't bother me. Flight staff were good. I would pay more to fly on a non rouge flight but they don't offer any to Florida. For our next flight I have paid the extra $40 for premium seats still in economy though so I hope the extra $ is worth it.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I traveled AC Rouge on flight 1851 March 17 and returned on flight 1852 March 20. We found that we were on a newer version of the 767-300 with the wing tips turned up. The first class cabin had been reduced in size so that it was hard to get our carry on past the passengers already sitting without bumping them. When we got to our seats in a row near the back of the plane it was impossible to get our two regulation AC carry on bags in the same overhead. Seating was very cramped and my knees were tight against the seat in front of me. I had a window seat and it was very cold sitting there. My husband is 72 years old and has some circulation issues and could not move at all even though there was no baggage under the seat in front of him. We will not be able to travel AC Rouge anymore and will look for another carrier! We found the cabin crew was young and seemed stressed and not well trained. This gave me a very uneasy feeling if there happened to be an emergency.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
It was not less expensive than regular Air Canada. We flew regular Air Canada Toronto to Palm Beach International and flew home from Orlando to Toronto on Rouge. The Rouge leg was more expensive but we had no choice to fly it as they only do Rouge to/from Orlando now it seems. Worst part we brought Ipads for our children and ourselves but only 2/4 of us could log on to the in-flight "entertainment" because we were told by flight attendant there is a limit to how many people can log on during the flight. And the "entertainment" is all very old shows. Will never fly them again and will only fly Air Canada if I have no other choices.

AC Rouge 1836 May 6 2014 Phoenix to Ottawa. This used to be an enjoyable flight until it was converted to Rouge. When we booked we did not know that this would be a Rouge flight for which we were charged for seat selection even though we selected within the 24 hour window of the flight. I am 6 feet and the seating/leg room was really cramped and not pleasant. Thankfully the person in front of me did not recline their seat. One of the washrooms was out of order which created long lines and difficult passage through the aisle and no doubt inconvenience and annoyance for those seated in last several rows. The crew made only one pass with the beverage cart. While I bring my own iPad for entertainment others were left wondering where the inflight TVs went. The crew were very young-and likely inexperienced-their dress was unprofessional and I have doubts that they would have performed to the same level in an emergency as a more experienced crew. Good luck getting everyone out of the plane in an emergency especially through the over the wing exits with less space to manoeuvre in. While we arrived safely I am left wondering why Air Canada worked so hard to make air travel less enjoyable. I will not be flying Rouge again regardless of price. I will seek out alternatives even if it means driving to Syracuse to fly an American airline.

Tampa to Toronto. Just got "rouged" last night. One of the worst flying experiences. No leg room. (I am 5'6" which shouldn't be too squished.) The seats were so uncomfortable. I had the person behind me's knees in my lower back the whole time. No tv. Can rent an ipad for $10.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew Rouge from Toronto to Tampa for the first time a couple of weeks ago and upgraded to business using my e- upgrade credits - what a joke! seats are crammed no entertainment and staff are very new to the industry. As a super elite member with Air Canada I was more than upset that I had used six e-upgrade credits for such a terrible "business class" - these planes are awful and its clear it's all about quantity and no regard for the comfort of the traveler.

Rouge is a thinly disguised process of jamming more people into the same space. I am a Super Elite 100k Aeroplan member. I had my first Rouge flight Phoenix to Toronto and the seats are uncomfortable leg room is awful there was one beverage service. I initially booked on AC with my usual aisle. I was moved to window with no notification.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Regularly commute between LA and YVR. Was shocked by the sudden change to Rouge - and that's the only AC option now. The tightest legroom of any plane I have been on - have to be under 5'5". All language is around "leisure" so it appears they have abandoned interest in serving the frequent or business traveler. Web site does not even have new routes on them. Premium service is a joke with economy seats that just leave the middle seat empty - but still charge you business class prices ($700+ one way). Paid the same price as I always have for less service and less room.

YUL-MCO on the Rouge A319. Seats cramped beyond anything I've experienced before. I'd sooner fly a US carrier with stopovers than fly a Rouge configuration again due to the limited seat pitch (I'm 6ft tall). On the other hand I didn't mind the BYOD in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system but the seats need power / usb ports for this to be really useful. I found the entire flight crew to be genuinely friendly and welcoming.

BGI-YYZ AC1831. I'd be ok if I was paying discount prices for what I got but sadly Air Canada has found another way to take advantage of the lack of competition on these routes from Canada. As options are limited and BGI is home I guess I'm stuck. I'm just waiting for them to find a way to only award half the Aeroplan miles.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I was recently bumped from Air Canada flights flying Toronto to San Diego and return and put on Rouge. It was like being on a plane manned by high school kids whose attitude flippant manner and vocabulary did not instill any level of security or professionalism to which I have been accustomed from Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have traveled six segments with AC this spring and been pushed into the Rouge. Each time it has been a disaster and the service has decreased each time. The crews are very young and seems there is not any leadership at all. The last flight I experienced the newer model 767-300 which is built different than the older 767-300 and the overhead storage will not accept two legal size carry on bags and this created extreme stress with passengers and crew! On one flight my wife asked for a glass of water to take medication and was told to wait until the refreshment cart came around which was 1/2 an hour later. Another flight I asked for two more beers when we were 1 hour out of Toronto and the young staff just laughed and never returned. I have flown AC since 1958 and watched them go into bankruptcy protection on several occasions and they are track for the next time. Once a company forgets who the customer is and who is paying for the service they are on their way down.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I bought direct return flights a year ahead of time (YUL-CUN). I paid full fare. Without warning Air Canada re- routed me through YYZ and downgraded me to Air Canada Rouge. On the return flight I was also downgraded to Air Canada Rouge without any compensation whatsoever. On top of it the state-of-the-art wireless entertainment system didn't work and on the return flight we found out that the "state-of-the-art" wireless entertainment system doesn't even support the latest Windows 8.1 operating system. You should also know that the seats are extremely uncomfortable narrow and with little leg-room. The service was basic including incomprehensible French announcement (flight out of Toronto). On the return flight (direct to YUL) the flight attendants in economy didn't speak French but one. This simple fact increases risk in case of an emergency. Clearly Air Canada is reducing service and security (low cost) while maintaining full fare. It is a lost-lost for all travellers. Avoid Air Canada Rouge!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I booked an Air Canada seat to Los Angeles from Vancouver and was switched to Rouge without confirmation and no reduction in price (which was more expensive than flying to Toronto). The seats are painfully cramped and I only got a Diet Coke on descent as the crew was disorganized; there was no time to even pay for food because they didn't have time.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I also thought I was booking an Air Canada flight on-line and ended up on Air Canada Rouge. I did Toronto-San Jose-Toronto. Within 3 minutes of hitting the seat I told my partner we will never fly Air Canada Rouge again and unless there is a way to know whether our flight is an Air Canada flight or an Air Canada Rouge flight at the time of booking we are not booking with Air Canada again for fear of ending up on Air Canada Rouge. The aircraft is clean the crew were good the food was good but the seats are terribly uncomfortable and absolutely crammed in. We are iPad folks but the available entertainment is limited and dated. Never again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Was suppose to fly and paid for Business Class seat on Air Canada Toronto to Orlando in March. I fly Business Class to have a very large seat and a lot more leg room. It gives me a lot more room to work. This particular trip I flew AC using Aeroplan Airmiles. Get on the plane boarded to find out I am on an Air Canada Rouge Flight- in a class called Premium Class same size seat as an Economy Class seat. They block the middle seat with pillows belted in. The flight attendant assured me that even though the seat was a normal size seat that their service would be the same as Business Class. When I returned to Toronto I posted on Air Canada Rouge's Face Book page my disappointment. The replies for AC Rouge FB staff made all kinds of excuses. The end result after 10 messages back and forth they tell you send a letter to AC's Customer Relations. Customer after customer make the same negative comments. AC Rouge remove negative comment for the FB page and then block you from posting any more. Air Canada 'Rouge tells the customers to message Air Canada. Air Canada tell customers to contact Aeroplan. Aeroplan tells to it not their problem. Its on made vicious circle tying to get your problem solved. All I was asking for was the difference in Airmiles between AC Business Class Seat and a Regular Ecomony Class seat refunded to my Aeroplan Account.

All flights to/from YYZ. All flights direct. Avoid Rouge whenever possible. Have flown on 6 Rouge flights.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I understand the business model for Air Canada's decision to launch a "low cost" leisure (vacation) airline to popular vacation destinations in USA South and Europe. Their 'regular' Air Canada flights are staffed by more experienced (and expensive) crews with higher salaries and benefits such as employee pension plans and expensive to operate and maintain in-flight entertainment systems. Air Canada was having trouble competing on many of these routes served by other vacation airlines such as Air Transat Sun Wing and some charters. In my opinion the airline had another reason - their fleet of Airbus A319 and Boeing 767 aircraft were growing old and tired and needed new duties while Air Canada began a program of planning for their eventual replacement at the main airline with the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner and other aircraft types. Hence Rouge was born. I have been a loal Air Canada customer for over 30 years -- even travelled with them to Mexico which was excellent - but this Rouge experiment leaves a bad taste in my mouth and aches in my legs and back. The refurbished Rouge cabins on these planes have more rows of seats which means less leg room. Cramped and uncomfortable on a long flight to your vacation is not my ideal way of arriving. While the flight crew at Rouge are very attentative and friendly I feel pity for them that they have to deal with passenger complaints that are mostly no fault of their own. I recently flew Air Transat to Jamaica in a nice comfortable wide-body A330 with lots of leg room and a big seat-back free entertainment system all with refurbished cabins with soothing colours and advanced lighting to limit effects of jet lag. Lots of overhead storage space too. Fourth time I flew with them and never been disappointed. Rouge needs to change soon or they will just go to the place in the sky where many other airlines have gone before them to die. Rouge was supposed to be a "new airline" according to Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
On March 2/14 a friend and I were booked on an Air Canada Flight. I had no idea that it was Rouge until I completed the on-line check in. Our flight was to take off at 6.30 am from Toronto Canada. We all boarded the plane and approximately 5 min before take off we were asked to leave the plane as there was no pilot scheduled for our flight. We had to wait for 2 hrs for them to find another pilot and for him to arrive.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Along with 14 other passengers (18 in total) we booked our trip and paid for a flight on Air Canada. We were subsequently switched without our knowledge consent or a reduction in airfare in to the "Rouge" airline. We were "Rouged". Discount airline while paying regular price. Very deceitful. After learning of the switch I inquired to see if there would be any noticeable changes between the two carriers and was told "no just the flight number and departure times". That was incorrect. Rouge has pathetic inflight entertainment that you pay for and the food is inadequate for a family travelling with young children. The one item that may appeal to children (pizza) was not available.

Booked return flight from Toronto to San Diego recently for a conference and was looking forward to comfortable business class seating. Their version of business class is that they only fill the aisle and window seats leaving the centre seat open - really? How does that make up for horrendously uncomfortable narrow seats and no legroom? Entertainment was a joke - movies on I-pads were very old (Gigi) and certainly not very thought provoking. I gave up and read for the duration of the trip. FA's uniforms are terrible. Come on Air Canada what are you trying to do here. The passenger beside me paid $2600 for his flight from Montreal and this is considered low fare?

### Air Canada rouge customer review
April 21 2014. Flight AC1890. I recently booked a flight to Tampa Florida. When booking the flight nothing told me I was booking on Air Canada Rouge. If I had know I would not have booked this flight. I have never been on a plane where I have felt so crowded. I am only 5'4" tall and my knees hit the seat in front of me. The seats are so close I could not bend over far enough to put anything under the seat. This is certainly discount flying at it's worst I will make sure the next time I fly I don't get on Air Canada Rouge or I will fly another carrier. Also expecting to have entertainment on the flight either music or TV they have nothing. You can bring an IPAD that you have download an APP on or rent one for $10 during your flight nothing when booking the flight said anything about this.

I recently travelled to Mexico wasn't aware we were flying Air Rouge not that that was a big deal but you're almost sitting on top one another. No leg room but the worst was no TV to watch a movie - you could rent one but no thanks paid enough for the flight. It was a 5.5 hour flight so you think you would at least be able to watch a movie for free - not impressed!

Round trip Toronto to San Jose Costa Rica in Feb. 2014. We paid an additional substantial fee for the upgrade which provided slightly more leg room and the middle seat blocked off with pillows providing more room to aisle and window seat passengers. Pillows! We sent Air Canada a complaint email regarding many problems we experienced in booking our tickets finding out at the last minute that we were bumped down to economy etc. and have not yet heard back from them. Next time we travel to Costa Rica it's with WestJet.

I recently flew from Tampa to Toronto on Rouge. I was booked and paid for a regular AC flight but was changed to Rouge without any notice. We were packed on the plane like sardines no entertainment poor service. Our friends were with us. He is quite tall and he had to spread his legs around the seat in front of him because there was no leg room. Add to this the fact you pay for seat selection baggage lousy food cheap wine. And don't dear be one pound over your 50 pound limit per suitcase - or you will be on the floor at the counter area exposing your underwear to several others rearranding your baggage.

The first class cabin had been reduced in size so that it was hard to get our carry on past the passengers already sitting without bumping them. When we got to our seats in a row near the back of the plane it was impossible to get our two regulation AC carry on bags in the same overhead. Seating was very cramped and my knees were tight against the seat in front of me. I had a window seat and it was very cold sitting there. My husband is 72 years old and has some circulation issues and could not move at all even though there was no baggage under the seat in front of him. We will not be able to travel AC Rouge anymore and will look for another carrier! We found the cabin crew was young and seemed stressed and not well trained. This gave me a very uneasy feeling if there happened to be an emergency.

It was not less expensive than regular Air Canada. We flew regular Air Canada Toronto to Palm Beach International and flew home from Orlando to Toronto on Rouge. The Rouge leg was more expensive but we had no choice to fly it as they only do Rouge to/from Orlando now it seems. Worst part we brought Ipads for our children and ourselves but only 2/4 of us could log on to the in-flight "entertainment" because we were told by flight attendant there is a limit to how many people can log on during the flight. And the "entertainment" is all very old shows. Will never fly them again and will only fly Air Canada if I have no other choices.

AC Rouge 1836 May 6 2014 Phoenix to Ottawa. This used to be an enjoyable flight until it was converted to Rouge. When we booked we did not know that this would be a Rouge flight for which we were charged for seat selection even though we selected within the 24 hour window of the flight. I am 6 feet and the seating/leg room was really cramped and not pleasant. Thankfully the person in front of me did not recline their seat. One of the washrooms was out of order which created long lines and difficult passage through the aisle and no doubt inconvenience and annoyance for those seated in last several rows. The crew made only one pass with the beverage cart. While I bring my own iPad for entertainment others were left wondering where the inflight TVs went. The crew were very young-and likely inexperienced-their dress was unprofessional and I have doubts that they would have performed to the same level in an emergency as a more experienced crew. Good luck getting everyone out of the plane in an emergency especially through the over the wing exits with less space to manoeuvre in. While we arrived safely I am left wondering why Air Canada worked so hard to make air travel less enjoyable. I will not be flying Rouge again regardless of price. I will seek out alternatives even if it means driving to Syracuse to fly an American airline.

Tampa to Toronto. Just got "rouged" last night. One of the worst flying experiences. No leg room. (I am 5'6" which shouldn't be too squished.) The seats were so uncomfortable. I had the person behind me's knees in my lower back the whole time. No tv. Can rent an ipad for $10.

I flew Rouge from Toronto to Tampa for the first time a couple of weeks ago and upgraded to business using my e- upgrade credits - what a joke! seats are crammed no entertainment and staff are very new to the industry. As a super elite member with Air Canada I was more than upset that I had used six e-upgrade credits for such a terrible "business class" - these planes are awful and its clear it's all about quantity and no regard for the comfort of the traveler.

Rouge is a thinly disguised process of jamming more people into the same space. I am a Super Elite 100k Aeroplan member. I had my first Rouge flight Phoenix to Toronto and the seats are uncomfortable leg room is awful there was one beverage service. I initially booked on AC with my usual aisle. I was moved to window with no notification.

AC1830 Toronto to Bridgetown 24 April 2014. AC1831 Bridgetown to Toronto 4 May 2014. Like many others posting I booked flights for myself and my husband months in advance of our April 2014 trip to Barbados. When I booked I paid for an Air Canada flight - not an Air Canada Rouge flight. As I understand it Air Canada Rouge didn't even fly into Barbados at the time I booked. We were subsequently bumped to Air Canada Rouge with no consultation and no refund. I had upgrade credits to get us to Premium Rouge so the trip down wasn't too bad (except for the lack of entertainment) but the trip back in economy was terrible. My husband was forced to sit sideways (to the extent possible) in order to avoid jamming his knees into the seat ahead. Clearly AC didn't get anyone over 6 feet to test the comfort of these seats before they decided to alter the planes. So we got a "discount" service with no discount!

Flew Rouge YYZ-CUN in Feb 14. Knew when we booked it was Rouge and had concerns but Husband is AC Elite and we "always" fly AC so we gave it a shot. Big mistake huge mistake. I am only 5'3" and 125 lbs and even I found the seats awful. I had to stuff my jacket between my lower back and seat for support had back ache for 3 days afterwards. Paid for a vodka and sprite got the mini vodka and a little splash of sprite in a cup. For 6 bucks you would think you would get the whole can. Return flight sat on tarmac for 3 hrs getting a wheel fixed. Same as other posters first told 30 mins then 1 hr then 3 hrs. Seems mechanical problems a common issues. Hubby will still fly regular AC for business heaven help them if they bump him to a Rouge flight. We will fly some other airline for pleasure.

Departed Toronto on Feb 12 flight Ac1812 returned AC1813 on Feb 28. Flew return Toronto to Cancun. In Toronto flight was overbooked by 10 people very crammed seats no leg or wiggle room. Wife has problem with back and suffered the whole flight to Cancun. Flight back to Toronto the person in front of wife leaned seat back due to closeness of her knees to the back of seat she was crushed. The remedy was to move the person that forced the seat into here and his 10 year old child to first class where they where given food and drinks while the wife had to suffer. Very poor service poor seats no wiggle room and no leg room.

Outbound flight on May 1st AC 1820 return flight on May 5th AC 1821. I was recently Rouged on a flight to Cancun Mexico. I used 20 upgrade credits and when I selected my seats it clearly showed a standard executive class configuration of 2 wide seats per side. Imagine my surprise when I found the configuration to actually be the new slimline seats with a 3 seat configuration and a pillow placed on the centre seat. I feel that this is a blatant attempt to mislead and had I known that this would be the case would not have used the credits.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YUL-LAS return booked on Air Canada months ago converted to Rouge and refused to discount or refund flight to book elsewhere. Experience confirmed fears: heinous obvious decrease in legroom stripped of all entertainment including power outlets to stay plugged into streaming system IF it's working and IF you have an Apple device. Young and eager crew does not know what they're doing and their poor pay promises to keep turnover high and little improvement. AC management loves that they're still able to charge full Air Canada prices for discounted Rouge but that won't last. Certainly not for me. Actively booked away from AC - even mainline - on next 3 upcoming business/leisure flights.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I just flew from Vancouver to LAX on a Rouge flight. I booked with Air Canada because of my aeroplan points collection and my general good experience with the airline. I'm 6'5" so legroom on even a 3 hour flight is important to my level of comfort. All airlines are relatively tight but this Rouge flight was a new level of discomfort. I could barely squeeze my knees into the available area with one knee spilling into my neighbour's area. Even sitting bolt upright I wasn't able to get my knees into the available area. Thank goodness I was seated next to a tiny woman. To give you an idea of the lateral space she fell asleep and her head fell right onto my shoulder. When the person ahead of me put their seat back the seatback was right in my face to the point that I was barely able to read. It was ridiculous and I'll never fly Rouge again or AC for that matter as I might be bumped to Rouge without notice. On the upside the flight staff were very nice but that only goes so far when I'm crammed into a seat like a sardine.

Flew from YYZ to SJO longest 5.5 hrs ever. I have flown to SJO 7 times and that was the worst flight. The crew were very nice but that didn't make up for the cramped leg room and very uncomfortable seats. Luckily we all had iPads and could use the onboard entertainment system. The return flight was even worse we sat at the gate for an hour after boarding with no information then were told we had to leave the gate for a new flight coming in and we would be departing in 4-5 minutes which turned into 45 minutes. We waited 2 long hours for the wind to change direction so we could take off. Apparently the plane Rouge sends to San Jose Costa Rica is not big enough or powerful enough to take off full if the wind is blowing towards the mountains if they had tried we would have crashed into the mountains. This was told to me after the fact by someone extremely familiar with the planes used by Rouge. We have never experienced such a delay in all the years we have traveled to SJO back to Air Transat for us. So a 5 hr flight is now a 7 hr flight in uncomfortable cramped seats my six year old was very tired and upset after all that. This was our first experience with Rouge and our last.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
My husband and I recently took an Air Canada vacations flight to Costa Rica. We had never flown on Air Canada Rouge and had no idea how small and tight the seats were. Luckily because my husband has knee issues we paid extra for one of the extra leg room seats. But the entire return trip I had the person's knees sitting behind me pressing in the small of my back. Why would they do that to people who have to be on a plane for 5+ hours? It was my understanding that Air Canada offers free meals on flights over 2 hours - but nothing was offered. Given the length of the flight I expected more comfort and service.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
AC1837 on May 5. Has anyone actually had a good Rouge experience. Mine certainly wasn't. I paid the full AC fare for a Rouge flight from YYZ to PHX (the only direct flight option) and sat on the plane at the gate for 3 hours while they tried to decide how to resolve their "technical issues". 3 hrs spent in a cramped seat working on a too-close tray table without a power source for my laptop. The end result was de-planning and then fending for ourselves to make alternative travel arrangements. Rouge did not cancel the flight - it took off 9 hrs after its originally scheduled departure. Basically Rouge is like a discount charter vacation service at full service prices with few planes available so if something goes wrong with yours prepare to camp out there's no back- up. What were they thinking?

### Air Canada rouge customer review
AC421 Mar 2 Samana to Montreal. Very disappointed in my flight travelling back from Samana. I was in premium seating and my friend I was travelling with upgraded. However they were unable to confirm our seats together. We ended up sitting by two different passengers who did not what to trade seats. The flight attendant kept speaking only French to me. I do understand French but my language of choice is English. This happened several times. I won't discuss luggage problems as this will not be published.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
AC1830 on May 4 2014. I am a regular customer of Air Canada on the Barbados-Toronto route. Like many of the other business travel regulars we were generally satisfied with the service on the route. The flight attendants knew what they were doing the pitch on the seats in economy and business was fine (even on the 319) and the in-flight entertainment system was a plus on the flight that can be over 5 hours. This new Rouge service is a huge step down in quality with no reduction in fares. The economy seats are too narrow and close together for anyone over 5 ft tall. The iPad based entertainment has a degraded selection of material. And any upgrade to their premium service is a joke. Yes two more inches in pitch but the seats are the same narrow width in economy. Even the overhead storage is reduced in the front of the plane. The flight attendants are obviously new and not yet up to speed. An absolute waste of money to pay for the upgrade and a waste of Upgrade points. The only safe bet is to get in the preferred seating row. Most of us are now looking to the alternative Westjet. I would not advise anyone to book the Rouge service if they have a choice.

Venice to Toronto on August 23 2013. Air Canada stuck us on this flight on the return trip from Venice to Toronto. My husband is 6 ft 5 and my 3 sons are 6 ft 2 so needless to say they were all miserable. No entertainment Rude service. Really old plane. There was so little padding in the seats that any time you used the seat pocket you poked the person in front of you. Will never travel with Air Canada again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew from Barbados to Toronto on AC Rouge and I saw red. I didn't notice when I booked the flight that this was AC Rouge. The seats are very uncomfortable limited leg room and crammed. No audio no USB or electrical plug. I don't have and IPhone or IPad to download the AC Rouge Apps to see movie or listen to tunes therefore I read Enroute. This was the worst flight ever! Flying 6 hours sitting on those seats killed my back and I was bored. For extra cash I will be flying West Jet. AC Rouge would be fine for short flights EG: Ottawa – Toronto. AC lost my business!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew YYC to LAS a couple days after these flights were Rouged. Flight attendants were horrible either the PA system was poor or their speaking ability or both. The announcements in French would make my elementary French teacher cringe but it wasn't like the English was that much better either it felt unrehearsed and like they were reading off post it notes and need to pause every few words to find their place. The lack of IFE was archaic for a new airline and was the clincher for me to not fly this airline again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Recently flew "Rouge" and got "rouged". No leg room for anyone over 6 ft tall very narrow seats very limited overhead compartments for small hand luggage. In fact before boarding people were asked to volunteer to have their hand luggage checked. I bought a full service regular seat and got downgraded without being consulted. Will avoid or find alternatives to anything "rouge" related.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I was traveling from Ottawa to Las Vegas via Calgary and was told at check in my connecting flight from Calgary to LV was on AC Rouge. When I complained I was told that there is nothing that could be done other than refund my ticket and cancel the trip“if I was not happy”. As I had meetings planed this was not an option and one which I personally think they use to most BC travellers who are not happy. When I got to Calgary I spoke to the AC representative at customer service and she advised me to write to AC and complain. She told me that this is a budget carrier so don't set your expectations high. As a traveler who clocked up more than 150k miles last year with AC they have certainly made me consider my carrier of choice. The seats were awful the food the same bland offering as usual cabin dated but the staff were attentive and seemed to go out of their way to serve maybe I drew a good hand on this flight. I will reiterate what the agent at customer service stated to me “this is a budget carrier”so don't set your standards too high.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I originally booked a regular Air Canada return flight between Vancouver (YVR) and Los Angeles (LAX). While the flight to LAX was all that I expect from Air Canada (including meal-for-purchase and in-seat movies) unbeknownst to me the return portion of the trip was changed to an Air Canada Rouge flight - meaning no meal-for-purchase no in-seat movies not even any orderly boarding of the aircraft plus the flight was an hour late to boot). I did not pay for an AC Rouge flight and certainly wasn't prepared for absolutely zero amenities on the flight. I have been a loyal Air Canada customer for decades but will never book or fly on Air Canada Rouge again. Clearly though booking what I thought was a regular AC flight didn't mean anything as the flight was changed with no notice to me or any other options. Shame on Air Canada for doing this to customers!

Flew to Florida on flight AC1860 May 2/14 at 6.30am return on 7th. I'll take the friendly service of this non- union staff any day of the week over that of the staff from its parent company. Onboard entertainment using your own device is a brilliant way to keep costs down. I'll forego a few first world luxuries over being treated like a third class citizen. The cheery Rouge uniforms matches that of their customer service. I'm excited to have an option under Aeroplan outside of AC.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YVR-LAX. Probably the most uncomfortable and worst seats on any airline. I am average build and height and I could barely fit in my seat. On-flight entertainment was not functioning. No real price savings. Thankfully there are other carriers that service LAX from YVR.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Super Elite traveller purchased a business class ticket from Montreal to Cancun back in October 2013 (for an April 2014 trip). In March 2014 this flight became a rouge route - and this is not what I purchased originally. Rouge seats service IFE are not the same. You could not entertain a conversation with the staff in French. Wifi did not work at all so no IFE.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada has really missed the mark with Rouge. I understand this is supposed to be a leisure low cost alternative for Canadian going to southern destinations or Europe however I have found the fare is generally the same as full service Air Canada with all the benefits stripped away. The Entertainment system rarely works and the movie selection is very old/out dated. The legroom in rows 20 and back is very limited and if the person in front of you reclines you can barely open your tray. The food and beverage service is exactly the same Air Canada free drinks food for purchase.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
April 28 YYZ-NAS. I booked Rouge Premium. We boarded fairly quickly and efficiently were offered juice and water while still at the gate newspapers as well pushed-back and took off on time. FAs were friendly perky and a bit informal and their service throughout the flight was courteous and efficient. Food and drinks were exactly the same as Air Canada mainline Business. The big downside of Rouge are the seats I'm 6ft 3 and weigh 220lbs. I had just enough legroom so my knees did not bang into the seat in front of me and I was able to cross my legs no problem. There is definitely less legroom between the Rouge Business seats and the Air Canada Business seats. The seats are pitiful on the recline only 3 inches and is pretty useless. The seats on Rouge are called "New Slimline Seats" and they definitely are slimline especially on the cushion aspect as well as much narrower since they have jammed 3 seats across into the same space that used to have 2 across. There is absolutely no lumbar support so lower backpain is the reward after a couple of hours. 2 other aspects about the seats the actual length front to back of the seat is less than normal so no support for the upper thighs which can be problematic for some. No inflight TV screen on the seatbacks just the foldaway meal table a-la 1970s aircraft seats along with a couple of pockets. My Rouge flight was only half-full so as I said service and food were up to Air Canada mainline standards in Business class but the Rouge business class seats comfort and space are a definite step down. I paid the same airfare for less legroom less comfortable smaller seat and less space as I paid 4 months ago for a standard business class seat and space on the same route with regular Air Canada. I will only fly Rouge on flights of less than 3 hours and only if I can get a seat in the Rouge "business" class and only if their are no other airline choices.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Las Vegas to Calgary April 29th. If our experience on a Rouge flight is any indication this Air Canada endeavour is a huge bust. We fly Air Canada a lot and this was without question the most uncomfortable flight we have had. We arrived at the airport to discover our full fare booking (made 3 months prior) had been changed to a low cost” Rouge flight. The 319 plane was cramped with uncomfortable seats absolutely no leg room and no ventilation. Average height people found their knees jammed into the seat ahead of them and it was impossible to bend over to place or retrieve items from under the seat. Heaven help you if the person in front of you reclined their seat even the small degree they move. No entertainment (unless you wanted to rent a tablet) and no power to the seats if you wanted to use your own just topped the cake. Air Canada has gone too far trying to cram as many people as possible into a plane. We could not wait to get off this flight and will never fly Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Tampa to Toronto on Apr 27th. Terrible describes it in one word. Seats are terrible and morale with travellers is contagious I am super elite now for a number of years and feel married to Air Canada. I travel YYT to TPA at least 10 times a year and I really don't like WestJet. However WestJet is superior to this. Business class is a joke and prices are Air Canada regular not discounted like the service. I am sorry but they have lost my vote.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flight was from LAS to YYZ in April 2014. This was probably my worst experience with Air Canada. Cramped and uncomfortable seats little to no ventilation an aircraft that was probably 20 years past its prime and flight attendants that seemed like they just wandered in off the street and were given uniforms. I feel very fortunate that we didn't have to find out how the flight attendants would have responded to an emergency situation. As with others the flight was changed after booking but at the same fare. Just a terrible overall experience and I couldn't wait for it to be over. I have flown with Air Canada as much as possible for over 25 years - this was truly the worst and I will simply refuse to fly with Rouge again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Rouge flight from Tampa to Toronto on 27 April 2014. I am a frequent flyer Elite 50K and most to and from that destination. First experience with Rouge! Best word to describe my experience "horrible". Without a doubt the most uncomfortable flight in a full-sized aircraft ever. 6' 11/2" (there are taller) my tailbone pressed against back of seat and knees wedged against seat ahead. Could not move for almost 3 hrs. And I mean I could not move. As I recall even WestJet has more space. Will be seeking out other means to get to FL. The bottom line is important but this tactic will in the end loose them their most frequent customers. Do they care?

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We booked with Air Canada in August 2013 for a return trip Toronto - Tampa. The return flight was changed to Rouge the day before we left. The seats are horribly close. 5 inches from knee to seat in front. Lack of food service. Took hours for the one attendant to get a drink of even water to us. I will never fly Air Canada again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I have flown Rouge twice in the last two months on business. The airplanes were old and under-staffed. It took over 2 hours to get a refreshment. The App-based entertainment was pathetic - perhaps it works for those with smart devices (which 75% of people do not have) but try sitting with a laptop on your food tray in a seat that is far too close to the seat in front of you and you will not be impressed.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
AC1851 Toronto to Las Vegas April 17th. Wifi kept on cutting out and finally never worked. The service was very slow no one passing in the alleys. The flight attendant call button on all seats was non functional until I complained about it and then it was turned on 2.5 hrs into the flight. Bathrooms are dated and not very clean ran out of paper towels halfway through the flight and never replaced. Price is similar to Air Canada flights yet Air Canada Rouge is like a third world airline. I had to ask 3 times for decaf coffee over a period of 2 hours. Very poor customer service. It is unacceptable that on a long flight both the entertainment system and service are terrible.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
They pack you in like cattle. Flight attendants allowed passengers in back rows to place their overhead luggage in the front overhead bins - where are these passengers in the front rows suppose to put their luggage? No entertainment - they rent you an ipad or whatever for $10 - money money money. And not even a cookie or titbit to go with the 'free' beverage. We will never fly Air Canada rouge again and perhaps not even Air Canada if it can be helped.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
On a recent flight from San Diego to Toronto I was not informed that I would be on Air Canada Rouge - which I consider a "discount" carrier after my experience. My flight was booked months ago on Air Canada so I was surprised of not only the change to Rouge but a time change also. Good thing I checked in advance as the flight left earlier. The first eyebrow raising experience was when the pre-flight announcement indicated that our flying time was more than the gate-to-gate time. I only had about 2" from my knees to the seat back in front of me which made it impossible to access anything stowed under the seat in front of me. I was cold and I could see others were reaching for their jackets too to cover their laps and legs. I was surprised also at the lack of in-flight entertainment. I also felt the flight attendant's uniforms didn't look smart or professional. I would not choose to fly again on Air Canada Rouge & I am relating my experience to whomever will listen. I feel Air Canada has made a mistake in introducing these so-called cost-saving measures. I feel many customers will be lost to competitors.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew from NAS-YYZ on flight 1833 and I can honestly say that this was the most uncomfortable flight and most disappointing in-flight experience that I have seen. Sat down in my seat and could had to sit at an angle for the whole flight because my knees would not fit in the seat pitch (and I am only 5'10!). There is no screen and no power source on these flights but they provided entertainment through iPads. Fortunately I had the most up-to- date Air Canada app so I could access the entertainment free of charge. Seat were beyond uncomfortable and the head flight attendant was rude beyond belief. I found it funny that she had to read the "scripted" relaxed announcements. I am an Altitude 50K Aeroplan member and have literally flown thousands of flights and I have never been so disappointed with the in-flight experience I had with Air Canada rouge. To anybody who wants anything near a comfortable flight: do NOT book a AC rouge flight. Book Westjet or a US-based airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew from Montreal to Las Vegas in premium. Service was terrible and entertainment was even worse. If flight attendants make an announcement your Ipad freezes if the announcement is longer than 1 min you must restart the movie or show from the beginning. Very sad that Air Canada would attach their name to such poor service when people are so use to have great service on Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Terrible experience seats are very small and crammed in. Pretty much same as Sunwing layout but seats are more uncomfortable. No TV screens you have to bring your own iPad apparently to access movies (and sit it on your lap or table tray - did not try this out but hear it did not work well). On way back to Toronto from Orlando (flight 1863 Sunday April 20th) there was a 10 hour flight delay due to mechanical problems. So instead of arriving home at 1pm we got home at midnight. I can understand weather delays or other emergency delays but this was ridiculous. The part they were missing was originally "a small thing that should be fixed in 30 mins" then that turned into another hour then another 2 hours then another 7 hours. I'm sure they knew at the start it would be a 10 hr delay - and had we been told we could have left airport and spent day at Universal Studios with our friends instead of hanging around airport. My hunch is that given the planes are older the delays are not unusual. One good thing: The staff were friendly. Overall the flights are way too expensive given the service provided and uncomfortable seats.

Flew "Rouge" from Barbados April 18th absolutely worst flight we have had. We usually fly Air Canada but we will never fly Rouge again-you are cramped in like sardines no entertainment system - unless you bring your own laptop/tablet - word to Air Canada - this is not acceptable.

We have returned from a holiday in Barbados. We flew comfortably to Barbados as usual on Air Canada. To our surprise we were flown home on Rouge. It is a very uncomfortable plane for this long flight. Cramped seats which are very uncomfortable. There is a ten dollar fee for the IPad entertainment system. The plane and service was chintzy at best. Service staff tried to be cool. We are dedicated Air Canada travellers and this was not up to the standard we have come to expect.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Rouge Flight from SJD-YYZ in Rouge plus no J offered. Terrible inflight service. The crew did one service up the aisle selling meals and then disappeared for the rest of the 5 hour flight. They closed the curtains to the front galley for the whole flight which made it awkward to use the front washroom. They were visibly annoyed when they had to respond to passengers call button. Entertainment system did not work for half the flight. I will fly another airline which has real first class seating instead of Rouge anywhere. I am an SE / MM and this leaves me with less ties to the mainline carrier.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I took an Air Canada Rouge recently from San Diego to Toronto on an A319 and it was the most uncomfortable flight I have taken in years. The seats themselves are not comfortable. I am 6'3" and I physically could not place my knees in front of me and spent the flight trying to avoid being kneecapped by the attendant's carts. The woman in the seat behind my wife had her knees embedded into the back of my wife's seat and she was a lot shorter than 6'. There is no entertainment system other than the wifi - not even audio. I had a Blackberry Playbook with me and my wife had a Google Nexus but neither one could log into the "Air Canada App". No wonder Blackberry is in trouble when the national carrier couldn't be bothered to make their app compatible. I will do what I have to to avoid future flights on Rouge. I booked on Air Canada and was not aware that they placed me on a Rouge flight.

AC Rouge to Las Vegas. Horrible experience: no leg room no entertainment system except if using own entertainment device (mobile tablet or laptop). However the seats are lacking any power outlet and have no USB ports preventing charging. There is no way to make a laptop last the whole flight. Moreover mobile and laptop requires to have previously installed the Air Canada Rouge app which of course was not installed on my own devices.

Flew Ottawa-Toronto-Cancun-Toronto-Ottawa. All flights were late. On the way from Toronto to Cancun the boarding was late and we waited almost an hour on the tax way on the way back the flight was more than 2 hours late we lost the connection for Ottawa. They put us on standby for a flight 4 hours later without knowing if we could continue the same day. Finally it took us 19 hours to come back from Cancun to Ottawa and on top of it they sent one of our pieces of luggage to Newfoundland. We paid for seat reservations and did not get our seats. There was garbage from previous passengers on the floor. There was no wifi onboard and neither TV screens for such a long distance flight. Staff onboard were correct. Staff on the ground were very unpleasant and unhelpful. It will be our last trip with Air Canada.

AC Rouge 0818 to Puerto Vallarta Mexico and back with 0819 both flights simply horrible. No leg room bare bones no frills nothing. Very unsympathetic staff. Overall a very uncomfortable flight. I booked one year ago and it was an AC flight and was downgraded to Rouge. As a senior with artificial limbs I was extremely restricted soft seats no pillows or any options unless one paid an additional prohibitive sum of close to $1000 for a "Premier Rouge" seat. Although I am an Aerogold member I will no longer by loyal to Air Canada.

Just flew YYZ to SJO - my first flight with rouge. Seats are horrible no leg room very uncomfortable flight. Inexperienced staff did not help. Didn't have an ipad to watch the entertainment but they announced that they were having problems with it and were working on it. This was almost a 5 hour flight - seats are way too uncomfortable. Possible fuel leak delayed us out - sat on the plane for nearly an hour before we left. Wouldn't you think they would check for a fuel leak before loading us all on?

My family and I flew to Orlando from Toronto (AC 1862) on April 13. These flights are no cheaper than the regular Air Canada flights to Orlando (we usually go there twice a year) and to put up with the no leg room (I am a small female (5'4 and 120 pds) no service and a terrible entertainment system I would need these flights to cost $100 a ticket to put up with such a horrible flight. My husband (who is a super elite member) said that he will never take an Air Canada Rouge flight again.

Horrible. Paid for business class from Toronto to Las Vegas on April 13 2014 - no leg room / awful food / no wi-fi.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew non stop Rouge Flt. 1880 Jan 16 Toronto-Sarasota and return on Rouge Flt 1881 Apr. 5. Both flights were conducted in an efficient and professional manner. The new Rouge outfits worn by the youthful and polite flight attendants were jaunty and fun. Cafe service was good. The Economy seats were comfortable. The pitch at 29" is close but not something to obsess about. Hey the Rouge seat is wider at 18" than an Air Transat Economy seat at 16.5" I did not rent or bring an iPad on board so I cannot comment on the wi-fi entertainment offerings. The seasonal (winter) non stop Rouge service to Sarasota from Toronto is welcome and time saving as the rest of the year I have to make connections through Atlanta on Delta airlines or Charlotte on US Airways. Service on these airlines is also good but no better than Rouge. Rouge is a good airline & I wish it great success.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew 1851/1852 three times from Toronto to Vegas in March/April 2014. I thought Rouge was supposed to be a discount carrier but all 3 flights were over 1000 bucks. The seating is absolutely horrible - the worst I have seen in years and I have been a super elite traveler for the past 3 years. Wifi entertainment is extremely buggy on my iPad. Half the shows stop playing part way through and you can't even select individual songs from an album when listening to music - It always defaults to the first song in that album. The worst part about this whole experience is that not one time over the last 3 trips was the plane on schedule. The 2nd trip coming back to Toronto on the redeye flight was eventually cancelled at 3am keeping everyone waiting around the airport when it was known that the plane's broken windshield would not have been fixed that night. The next day was a nightmare the noon flight was delayed by 4hrs and they just couldn't manage the people waiting around very well. Put them on the next United flight out! But of course that means taking responsibility and taking care of the passengers something that Rouge and Air Canada seem incapable of doing lately. I have to say that the staff were friendly. I have been a loyal and frequent traveler with Air Canada for the past 9 years and I have to say that this is it for me. WestJet is in order of magnitudes better than Air Canada for their domestic coverage including US and I'm just hoping that they will bury this Rouge airline quick.

I travelled YYZ-SAN on April 1. The restrictive seat pitch on Air Canada Rouge A-319 is intolerable for a flight exceeding 5.5 hours. The operation of the flight was problematic. No reason or apology was offered for our 25-minute late arrival in San Diego. If it was due to adverse weather en route this must have been known to the flight crew prior to our departure from YYZ and appropriate measures taken. The flight was fully boarded and doors closed 10 minutes before scheduled departure time (6.05pm). Nonetheless the aircraft was held at the gate until 6.05pm and then started a lengthy taxi to the runway where it was delayed again to await two general aviation arrivals. For sheer professionalism I will travel by United next time.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew 1851 YYZ-LAS and 1852 LAS-YYZ recently and will never do it again! Old run down planes inexperienced flight attendants garbage in-flight entertainment system cramped seats and absolutely no legroom and I am of average height and weight. I fly this route fairly regularly and won't be flying Rouge again. It will be WestJet from now on or connections with United. Air Canada - putting Rouge on this route (as well as many others) was a very poor decision on your part and one that I hope you will re-visit. Until you do you've lost me as a customer.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew to Las Vegas over past weekend. Whole experience was beyond bad. Worst seating I have ever experienced. iPad did not work on inbound or outbound flights. Both flights gate attendants said at least 25 people had to check carry on bags did Air Canada not think or care that by cramming all those extra seats in the plane this might be an issue part of this issue of course is that that a checked for my wife and I adds another 100 dollars to the flight. I will never fly with them again will pay more for better airline.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
March 29 - April 2 2014 Toronto to Las Vegas it was one of the worst experience that I have had flying the leg room is terrible no entertainment and no adjustable air flow it gets very warm inside the plane also the staff were not very friendly I am glad that I didn't upgrade to business class because that was not much better. I fly to Las Vegas and Los Angeles on business several times a year and would hope that Air Canada would at least give me a choice to fly Rouge or Air Canada. I will be looking to fly with another carrier this is taking Air Canada back 30 years. I have been a super elite member for several years and try to fly Air Canada as often as possible. I hope this venture for Air Canada will eventually fail.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I flew business class on Air Canada Rouge on 2nd April back from Las Vegas and this was my first time flying with Rouge. I am baffled that Air Canada has their name associated with Rouge. Not impressed at all. No TVs and the ipads that were provided worked for about 15 minutes until they had technical difficulties. The seats are not as comfortable as a regular Air Canada flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flight 1873 Montreal-Orlando. March 28th departure April 4th return. Not worthy of Air Canada! Huge disappointment! Seats were extremely tight and I'm 5"3. My partner is 6"2 and were miserable. Air Canada Rouge is extremely cheap! No entertainment food claustrophobic! Choose other airline!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Montreal to Vegas on direct flight on A319. Simply put the legroom is beyond bad I am of average height when the person in front of me put back their seat it was hitting against my knees. To have to endure this for a 5.5 hour flight is a terrible experience. Flying back from Vegas on a 767 through Toronto and switched to an A320 which was not a rouge plane almost felt I was in 1st class. As far as the 767 plane no climate control constant draught. Overall a terrible experience. Out of curiosity found it was cheaper by about $200 to use another airline. Never will I fly on Rouge again unless they resolve the seating issue.

AC1852 3 April AC1851 6 April. Just got off the second leg of Vegas - Toronto and back. The seats were small with no legroom there was no closet and nowhere in business class for a business sized carry on. Very frustrating.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew AC rouge to CUN from Toronto in the J cabin. The service was acceptable the food was the same as mainline however the comfort in the redesigned A319 left a lot to be desired. Seats were very uncomfortable seat pitch in business class was significantly less than on mainline. The IFE was beyond terrible.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
AC 1880 and 1881 return from Toronto to Sarasota this past winter. We had the bad luck of being on a Rouge flight. I have one word to describe the experience. Awful. This old refurbished equipment which seems to have a lot of mechanical problems. The seats are extremely uncomfortable. There is minimal leg room even if you pay extra for the seats with supposed extra space. AC advertises this Rouge flight as a more economical flight. The only thing economical about it is the interior. We paid exactly the same as we have paid in all the other years we have gone to Sarasota. Business Class is a total joke. On our trip back to Toronto we only found out that the flight was delayed when we got to the airport. Flight Tracker gave no indication of this delay neither did the AC website. It would have been nice to have been notified of this delay by phone email or text thus saving us having to spend an excruciating amount of time at the Sarasota airport. Having tracked the arrival and departure times of these flights over the past several weeks of this winter it seems that the norm has been at least a 1 hour delay. The weather was not always a factor. AC has to improve this. We have choices as to how we get to Sarasota. It is for certain that we will not ever fly on a Rouge flight again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Booked a flight from LAS-YYZ on Air Canada's website and was forced to take AC"s new low cost carrier Rouge. The plane was an extremely old 767 and besides the refurbished carpet and seats everything inside was old and run- down. The overhead compartment are probably from the 1990s as I forgot the last time I saw limited luggage space like that. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable with no entertainment whatsoever (there is the option to rent an iPad for a fee). The flight was a red-eye of around 5hrs but half the time the cabin lights were on as the crew came around trying to sell food. This was very disruptive to rest and added to the general discomfort of the flight experience. The crew were young and "hip" looking and I must say they were friendly. However they seemed inexperienced and newly hired. There was a passenger who lay on her seat and stretched her legs into the aisle throughout the flight. This was during take off and landing and none of the crew said anything about having the arm rest down or the fact that her legs were obstructing the aisle. I am sure this violates various national and international safety regulations and the crew did not seem to mind. Probably one of the worst flying experiences I have had and I would definitely not recommend flying with Rouge.

Toronto to Las Vegas Flight 1851 March 27. Air Canada Rouge is simply horrible. The seats are so tight with no legroom. No inflight entertainment and FA's are not friendly at all. I didn't feel welcome or appreciated. The plane was dirty as it was not properly cleaned from the previous flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Air Canada Rogue is one of the worst if not the worst airline I have flown. I fly at least once a month. I booked my flights with Air Canada but the flights were changed to Rogue without notification. The seats are too small and very uncomfortable. My husband is 6'2" and he was uncomfortable the whole flight. My elderly mother was almost in tears due to the lack of leg room. There is no entertainment systems. The last flight had only some breakfast items on an evening flight. All passengers were complaining about the lack of leg room. It is torture if the person ahead puts their seat back. I have always been a loyal Air Canada customer but I will be booking WestJet were possible. The flights were so bad I would rather have to change planes than endure another Rogue direct flight.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
March 7 and 23 YYZ to SJO return AC1806/1806. I will never use Air Canada Rouge again. The 29-inch seat pitch is the lowest in North America with the exception of Spirit Airlines. This was the most uncomfortable flight I have taken. The barely edible food cost extra and most selections were sold out by the time the attendants reached my row. The in-flight entertainment system (which can only be played over one's own tablet or device) consistently malfunctioned. The plane was generally dirty and contained significant garbage left on earlier flights. A horrible experience.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
As a 4 times a year traveller to the Caribbean it is clear that ACR want to take every single penny of us the all inclusive prices are the same of AC. A flight is a flight the flight attendants are rude and impolite. I bought a sandwich that perhaps was a left over from another flight because the expired date was for the same day.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
When I booked ticket (3 in total) to travel the end of June 2014 from Canada to Barcelona Spain I booked with Air Canada and wanted AC to be my carrier. However I know find out we will be travelling with Air Canada Rouge the company's low cost carrier. I also have found out there will be NO entertainment unless you go out and buy an Ipad and the seats are going to be smaller and tighter together. There are other cuts and this is totally unfair to me as an Air Canada customer. I did not get any rebate for flying with this low cost carrier - absolutely nothing. It is just tough luck for us. I like travelling with Air Canada with their experienced crews and the special benefits that go along with the overseas flights. I am not happy about this - I feel like we have been Rouged by Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew from Toronto to Cancun the last week of January and dreaded the return the next week. We booked Air Canada because the flight times were good we collect Aeroplan and fly AC from Toronto to Calgary at least once a year. We did not know anything about Rouge and not until almost the time for our flight did we know AC had another section for hot spots. We were not concerned because we have always been happy with our service. We did not know there was no in-flight entertainment until we were on the plane. We do not use Apple products but have an Android tablet no good to us on the flight. The seats are squishy and uncomfortable. The only saving grace coming home was I had booked late flights so we just slept no other choice. When we got to our destination I went on the web to learn about Rouge. It is not easy to find anything. Next time we will go to the States and choose an American carrier. Never again Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Rouge "business class" from Toronto to Las Vegas and return a week ago. I had booked business class originally from Ottawa to Vancouver to Las Vegas but Air Canada cancelled that as the connection was too tight and instead routed me through Toronto. They promised me that business class would be exactly the same on Rouge but it is not! The seats are smaller there was no TV screen in backs of seats - they gave me a tablet to watch but the content was poor. Service was not good at all. And on top of all this the price was the same! Very disappointing.

I flew with Air Canada Rouge in January on business from Toronto to Sarasota and was seated in the standard cabin. Although the flight itself was pleasant enough the seats were very close together and cramped. If given the choice I would not choose to fly with them again.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Toronto-Puerto Vallarta-Toronto. Early both down and return! Great staff skewed younger and nice change from the stuffy regulars usually on AC! Service was great - purchased a wrap that was tasty! Entertainment - downloaded AC app and no problems both on my iPad and iPhone. Pitfall was not AC but the other passengers - one carry on means one not one plus a purse plus a backpack plus just "two little bags of shopping". Yes perhaps that is why you had no leg room your 5 carry on bags! There always has to be "that one" passenger and they always seem to sit near me! The seats are tight get over it you are on vacation - want a first class wide seat pay for one on a more expensive airline! Excellent service Rouge and can't wait to fly again!

### Air Canada rouge customer review
We flew from San Jose Costa Rica to Toronto Canada on Air Canada Rouge. A lot of unusual activity at boarding with seat mix-ups people on the plane with boarding passes with no assigned seats and lots of passport checks. The flight was totally sold and left 1/2 hour late. Five hours into the flight and a half hour before landing we are told that 50 bags could not be loaded onto the plane because of jet fuel concerns due to high winds at San Jose late departure full capacity. We deplane clear immigration and hope that our bags have made it on the plane. We learn that there are no bags on the plane at all! No one at the airport claim desk or customs seems to think that this is anything unusual. They promise that we will have our bags in 24 hours but given all of the misinformation we have received at this point I am not holding my breath. No wonder they have dubbed this airline Air Canada Rogue. No leg room smaller seats no entertainment no hot beverages due to potential turbulence total incompetence from check-in to airport exit.

21-24 March 10.20 departure arrived in Jamaica 1.20. Depart from Jamaica 2.40 arrives in Canada at 7.30. AC1805. The last time I flew Air Canada was 2007 so I decided to give them another chance. The plane was dirty no snacks on a 4 hour flight. The staff going down to my destination were neat and put together however the person doing the announcements needed some training. Entertainment both ways was horrible I could not even access it on my iPad. Comparing Rouge with WestJet and Air Transat they are so behind in time and entertainment. I am going away in June and there is a possibility that Air Canada Rouge will not be my first choice.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Air Canada Rouge to/from Costa Rica. Had never heard of Rouge and was not told that this would be the carrier even when I called to book seats and meals. There are no meals unless you buy the overpriced cold items available - very limited choice as would be expected on a flight. Had we known we would have brought our own food as we did on the return flight. Entertainment available by Air Canada app that must be downloaded before flight. A few tablets are available for rent - and they go fast. Seats are not comfortable - spent a week with back pain after 5 hours in one. There is also barely enough room to get into your seat. I'm not a large person but it was a challenged getting in and out of seat. Have flown Air Canada before and was happy with it. Not happy with Rouge and as you don't know if they will be the carrier when you book through Air Canada this will prevent me from ever booking a vacation or flight with them again. Cabin staff were friendly but not really helpful - there didn't seem to be anything they could do to help.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Flew Air Canada rouge Toronto to Grenada return March 3 and 10 2014. Will never fly it again. A disgrace for a any airline let alone what they term a discount airline. Will travel to US or make connections on other airlines before I fly them again. After a week of sun and relaxing to have to endure seats with no leg room and no entertainment or even a 25 cent bag of peanuts who needs this. Get Real Air Canada rouge. You say all is well but people will only fly once and say goodbye forget your return flyers.

Traveled from YYZ-MCO MCO-YYZ both flights were on time. The flight attendants are nice and helpful but a little disorganized. The plane was en airbus A319 and was modern and clean both ways. Seat are not very comfy plus there no legroom and you are squished in the seats. The service on the plane and at the airport are good. Movie system has new shows but old eps. Overall both flights were good. There is a good selection of food and drinks.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
LAS to YYZ March 2014. I am a loyal Air Canada flyer and mostly travel Executive Class. I am extremely disappointed with Rouge and how Air Canada is forcing its clients to use Rouge and has stopped regular Air Canada flights to my usual destinations. The planes are all very old and rickety and the attendants very inexperienced although all friendly. It would be different if the fares dropped in half but they are exactly the same which is ridiculous. I am looking for alternatives as I will not be forced to receive second class service for the same high prices the entertainment system is poor and they show movies on an old tube screen but do not provide the ancient headphone adapters so what's the point.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Just came back from a trip to Orlando from Toronto. Purchased my tickets on Air Canada only to find out a few weeks before that I got "Rouged". I am an Air Canada Altitude Elite 50K member and fly on mainline AC quite frequently. When I bought my ticket in April 2013 I expected to fly on the airline I originally booked with but that was not the case. They switched my flight without warning. Getting on the plane the first thing you notice is how they squeezed all the seats together to give you no leg room. Unless you are a young child your knees will be plastered against the seat back in front of you. Good luck with the inflight non-entertainment system - you will need to remember to charge your device completely because there are no outlets. Also the movies were all second rate. Best of luck trying to get any work done the cramped room does not allow a regular sized laptop to be placed on the tray table without being squeezed between your abdomen and the seat in front.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
They kept us on an airplane for 2 hours initially hardly any circulation trying to fix a problem with the navigation system. Then they left us on the plane for 2 hours while they tried to fix it giving us false hope every 30 minutes or so. They offered some of us a tiny bag of almonds but we had to share with the person beside us because they didn't have enough for everyone. Finally they got us off the plane 2 hours later. Gave us $10 to buy lunch. Flight was supposed to leave at 10.30am at 1.30pm or so we get an announcement saying flight will be leaving at 3pm. Then another delay to 4pm. Meanwhile the weather outside is getting worse and worse. So now we board at 4pm. They had us sit on the airplane for another 3 hours before we actually took off. 200+ people missed a whole day of vacation time. Updates were very infrequent. To top it all off the flight crew were miserable. They were finally walking by to offer us some food but a) they ran out of everything and b) they walked right by our row without asking. When I waved my hand the attendant got annoyed with me. It was the last time I fly with Air Canada. The free food was a sandwich. The drinks - they gave you pop juice or water and you couldn't have an actual can. Inflight entertainment - forget it. They didn't play a movie on the way to Montego Bay. You had to have the app downloaded on your phone. If you didn't have the app you got nothing.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Feb 27 2014. When we original booked this flight from Toronto to Orlando return it was with Air Canada. When Air Canada up and decided to change the flights to Rouge there was no compensation for cost given as a refund or credit as Rouge is supposedly a cheaper flight. This fact was confirmed by speaking with other passengers on the flight who booked the flight through Air Canada Rouge. Not only did they not compensate us for the change they automatically changed our seating - splitting my husband and myself approximately 8 rows apart. I would also confirm that I had to prepay for seat selection. When I went to check in online the flight was sold out and I could not get my seat that I had paid for back. The new seats are horrible. I am only 5 feet and I couldn't get comfortable with the decreased leg room. I don't know how they expect people to sit in these seats for a 5 plus hour flight. They have taken out the TVs in the seats. They boast themselves as having a huge selection of movies etc. with their new app that has to be downloaded. Their huge selection is worse and older than Netflix. It really is a joke. If you want anything that is enjoyable make sure you download your own movies/shows before flying. Next time look at WestJet before booking Air Canada.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I am relatively tall and have just experienced the most uncomfortable flight in my (substantial) list of flights (over 50 years). In the interest of (literally) squeezing the last buck out of their aircraft's potential they have shortened (even further) the distance between seats making it impossible for me to withdraw my legs to sitting properly behind the seat ahead! Totally ridiculous whoever came up with this "brilliant" move must have been a height challenged individual.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
On March 2 2014 we flew back from Puerto Vallarta on Air Canada Rouge (flight A/C 1819). Was it a good experience? No. It was an awful experience. Rouge makes us see red. The seats in the plane were so crammed up that we felt that we were in a can of sardines One of us is 1 m 90 tall Consequently his knees were stuck in the seat in front of him with no way of stretching his legs. Many passengers with mobility issues had a hard time getting out of their seat (e.g: to go to the washroom). Rouge is a poor service and shame on Air Canada for offering it. It shows disrespect to the clientele. We’d rather pay more money to get a better service and have more space. We expect a better service.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
YYZ-MCO-YYZ. Family of 5 travelling in economy. On time departures both ways. Flight crew was very friendly and attentive (also much younger than the average AC flight crew which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Aircraft was an A319 in rouge livery. Pretty basic but clean and nice. The only catch is the IFE is Wifi-based so you have to have an IPhone or IPad with the AC app or you need to rent one in flight for $10. Fortunately they told us this before we departed so we were able to download the app.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
LAS-YUL on March 14. First impression is that legroom is very tight as compared to regular AC flight on a similar airplane so much that my legs hurt at the end of the 5hr trip (and I'm no big guy). Catering goes as always from front to rear and food is for purchase. If your seat is at the back of the plane good luck getting proper food you'll have to make do with chips and chocolate bars. I did not use the wi-fi flight entertainment system but others tried and were not able to get the feature working properly. Staff friendly but issues are not related to them. It just feels as if Air Canada has decided to cheap out as much as they can while still charging a premium.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
I took AC Rouge for a flight back from Las Vegas. Flight attendants were very young and inexperienced. Very poor service onboard one beverage service for a 5 hours flight (FA's having fun in the back of the plane for the rest of the time). No announcement from the captain. Very few iPads available. I'm a frequent traveller with AC I will avoid Rouge.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
After reviewing the webpage for Rouge I charged up my laptop and tablets to make use of the entertainment system on board that streams content to your device. For the flight to the destination the onboard system malfunctioned flight attendants were unable to make it work for any passengers. For the flight back home it was working however after trying to stream the content for 30 minutes on each of my devices I asked the flight attendants why it was not working and they replied that the service is for Apple customers only. Air Canada Rouge should specify that only Apple products will work with their systems. Seat pitch was uncomfortable in the A319. On the way to my destination attendants came only once with food and beverage service for a 4.5 hour flight. Also I was under the impression that Air Canada had to hire bilingual staff members where the only French that the flight attendants were able to speak was when they were reading the safety demonstration card and the landing card. They were not even able to provide accurate translations of the Captains announcements. Not impressed.

AC 126 Edmonton to Toronto Mar 1. AC 1874 Toronto to Orlando Mar 1. AC 1875 Orlando to Toronto Mar 14. AC 175 Toronto to Edmonton Mar 14 2014. Air Canada Rouge is definitely not up to Air Canada standards! I fly AC on a weekly basis and took a trip down south with my family on AC rouge. It is not the AC that I am used to that is for sure. Bad seats no leg room and multiple delays on both legs 9 the trip. I am loyal AC customer but won't fly rouge again.

Toronto to Montego Bay return. Cabin outdated and in need of serious attention. Inflight "entertainment" is wildly outdated. Good point: I travelled in business class and food was pretty good. Service a bit slow but at least we got fed. Overall average and definitely not worth the cost.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Second experience with Air Canada Rouge. AC 1871 MCO to YUL Feb 28 seat 3A on an Airbus A319. There was no premium class on this flight so all seats are available in the first 3 rows and no other perk than an extra 6 inches of leg room. Cannot use E-Upgrades certificate to get these seats only available for a fee of $30 unless you are lucky and these are the only seat available when you board. Plane was full. Take-off was aborted in the middle of the runway for a faulty alarm apparently we had to go back to gate. After several passengers asked for it one FA passed the water. FA had plastic smiles (not as genuine as my first flight) and seemed very tired. We landed about 90 min late from schedule. I find slim line seats to be uncomfortable after 30 minutes so this delay was not welcome. In addition I wanted to do some work on my computer but as the person in front of me decided to recline his seat I had no room to open the laptop and work on it. Level of service and comfort comparable to Allegiant who offers the flight to BTV for $111. Not at all comparable to AC Main Line service and comfort but price is the same. IMO comparable to lower class airline service like Ryan Air Allegiance Jet Blue at a premium.

My first AC Rouge flight YYZ-LAS on a 767 in Premium Rouge. With all the griping previously posted here I was curious and apprehensive. Aside from the change in IFE (streaming vs VOD) the flight was very similar to AC mainline North American service. FA's pleasant and attentive breakfast nice on time arrival and departure. No complaints at all though I imagine those on the narrowbody service will be surprised by the seating configuration in Premium.

YYZ-VRA Feb 6 AC Rouge 1752. VRA-YYZ Feb 13 AC Rouge 1753. This is Air Canada's new flag carrier. Stay away unless you like the smallest leg room in the air. If the seat ahead of you is reclined even slightly no room on the tray for even a coke can! Staff are annoyingly friendly with silly banter and phoney smiles. Absolutely no in- flight entertainment unless you bring a device and pre-install proprietary software. On the upside 100lb baggage allowance is highest around.

### Air Canada rouge customer review
Despite all the previous comments on this website about how poor Rouge is I have just come back from a trip to Las Vegas from Toronto and found the airline to be more than adequate. The aircraft itself was in good shape the seating was 2-3-2 in economy. I sat in an exit seat on the way out and in a bulkhead seat on the way back and had lots of legroom and the seats themselves were not too narrow even for me as a 6'2" guy. The staff were very competent and helpful and the service was good throughout. Their uniforms are a bit silly but there you go. The on-board food selection was OK absolutely not any worse than any other airline believe me. The on-board entertainment although a bit different (had to have an app on a laptop or ipad) was perfectly good although slightly limited. I did not pay to access this. Overall on this route and with this aircraft all was good and no issues whatsoever.

Terrible. I flew from Sudbury to Toronto to get this flight and the little Dash 8 from Sudbury had more legroom. The lady in front reclined so I watched her hair for 3 hours. Could not see my smartphone even if I had been stupid enough to pay for inflight entertainment on a 4 inch screen.

AC1870 on Feb 17 seat 1A. I bought a flight pass for regular flights from Montreal to Orlando. Usually excellent service on Air Canada. They switched to Rouge last Monday. It is like buying a first class train ticket and being switched to a school bus. Premium" class seats are economy poorly padded no working space. Entertainment system is an I - Pad (free in Premium - $10 in economy ) which works erratically at best. Staff doing their best with the tools they are given wearing a uniform that seems to have bought on sale at Giant Tiger.

AC 1881 Feb 12 2014 Sarasota to Toronto. Delayed 4.5 to 5 hours as of now. No considerations to passengers. JetBlue also delayed but they brought in pizza and drinks for their passengers. Many considerations to those that smoke to leave the secure area but no food. All the kiosks have been closed at this airport by 6 pm!

Just returned from Huatulco Mexico. Booked our trip back in August with Air Canada. At the time had a choice of 3 airlines and even though Air Canada cost more money booked with them anyway as in the past were very happy with service flight and experience. Found out 2 weeks prior to our trip that we'd be flying Air Canada Rouge instead. Not at all a similar experience. Flight attendants were inexperienced and one was very rude. Airplane was freezing when we boarded in Toronto. Overall a horrible experience both ways. Won't book Air Canada again as there is no guarantee we'd be flying with them instead of Air Canada Rouge.

YYZ to MCO and return in January. This was my first experience with Rouge (I had booked the flight before it was Rouged) and it was a major disappointment after flying regularly with AC for the last 30 years. The seats were not comfortable and the pitch is inadequate. The inflight entertainment is a joke nobody in their right mind should rent an ipad or pay for the entertainment offered through their wifi service. The FAs did the minimum required. Coming back to the non-entertainment system as there are no power points you are unable to charge any mobile devices not sure if any batteries can last 7 or 8 hours for the Rouge flights to Europe! AC needs to re-think the customer experience for Rouge.

YHZ-YYZ AC619. YYZ-MCO AC1868. Air Canada Rouge: A discount airline which happily accepts full business class fares for tiny seats and no significant added value. I will never fly this airline again in business class. Cancelled my return fight and chose to fly another airline. Simple solution don't sell business class seats. Shame on Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge.

Flew from Toronto Canada to Samana Dom Rep with Rouge airline (a branch of Air Canada) and the flight was great. The plane was an Airbus 319 it was modern and clean. Lots of leg room and the seats were comfortable. We had not flown with Air Canada in over 5 years and we had noticed a difference. If the chance comes up in the future to fly with them (its all about the price) we will.

Departure Toronto to LV Jan 19 on AC 1851. Return LV to Toronto Jan 24 on AC 1852. Over the past 10 years Air Canada has turned me into a loyal customer. They achieved this through quality aircraft crews who are customer focused and many little things such as comfortable seats the best inflight entertainment and an overall enjoyable travel experience. However I believe their attempt to compete head to head with low cost carriers and take market share from them will backfire. My Rouge flight to Las Vegas was cramped uncomfortable had no seat back entertainment system and the in-flight crew was undoubtedly frustrated by all the complaints and remarks that they were to the point of being rude. Through a 4.5 hour flight I didn't receive a visit from a flight attendant and wasn't even offered a glass of water. The worst part of the experience was the fact that I wasn't even aware this was a Rouge flight until I received an e-mail about their in-flight entertainment system. Up until the Rouge idea Air Canada had done a remarkable job of building a first class airline. I will never fly Rouge again and will even think twice about flying Air Canada in the future.

December 27 YYZ-MCO. January 4 MCO-YYZ. January 26 MCO-YYZ. Do not fly Rouge seats are crammed staff are not knowledgeable planes are always delayed. After you book a seat and pay for preferred seating they will send out an aircraft change notice without notifying you and you will be moved to a different seat and separated from who you are flying with.

Toronto to Las Vegas. Poor overall. Cramped seats - feel sorry for those on the aisle that have to contend with a steel box on the floor. No screens on the seat backs - so no movies unless you have an ipad - and mine didn't work with it. No big loss since the movies are all antiques anyway! No power for your computer. All this at a time where it appears that Air Transat is putting in screens.

YYZ-LAS-YYZ. Never again! Five hours squished in an inhumanely tiny space with our knees pressed to the seat opposite us. The flight was no better than a cattle bus. The crew dressed up in ghastly uniforms and silly hats with seemingly no idea of what they were doing let alone what they were telling the passengers during the announcements. No food unless you buy the poor quality food they sell on board and no in seat entertainment system. My wife insisted we spend the extra money and return by Westjet which we would of done had they not been sold out. We will never fly Air Canada Rouge again.

Air Canada is mediocre as it always has been but Air Canada Rouge is an absolute travesty. Usually when service and comfort drop the prices would too. Zero leg room for anyone taller than about 5'8" and completely unhelpful customer service agents made my recent flight from Toronto to Orlando a nightmare. Fly pretty much any other airline if you have the opportunity.

CUN-YYZ: In July I booked a December trip on Air Canada and several months later we received an email saying the flight had been switched to Rouge but no refund so we paid for an Air Canada flight but got a much less comfortable Rouge flight for the same price. The seats on Rouge are very cramped: my husband's knees were hitting the seat in front and my son who is 6'4" had to sit with his legs spread knees pointing outward. No screens in the back of the seats and if you don't have the device and app that connects to their system you can rent one to watch movies at a cost of $10! As far as staff go they seem to be trying to make Rouge more like Westjet's casual and friendly style but failed dismally on our flight. Announcements had a false perkiness to them... it sounded like they were trying to be conversational but were obviously reading (badly) from a script. The staff member doing the French announcements had an appallingly bad accent. Staff were pleasant enough but announcements very annoying.

My husband and I recently took AC Rouge to Cancun upgrading to premier seating. There was no business class available unless we flew through Montreal. I have been a loyal AC customer for many years - typically reaching Super Elite or Elite Status. All I can say is the flight was very disappointing. The flight attendants were inexperienced - spending far too much time in the galley giggling with one another. The premier seats were minimally better than a regular economy seat. The onboard meal options were horrible - and did not have any hot meals available although listed as a menu option. We are taking one more chance - we booked business class rouge to Cancun in February. I am hoping for the best and expecting the worst. If no better we will need to look at other airlines. And get rid of the "hats" - they look ridiculous.

YYZ-LAS. In a word-terrible and to be avoided. I feel taken advantage of that I paid the equivalent of a business class fare for a tawdry uncomfortable and disappointing experience. The plane was an ancient 767-300 and the seat I was given in the called overcrowded Premium Rouge premium cabin was badly upholstered narrow and uncomfortably lumpy. I was unable to access any media content with my iPad because of some glitch in the wireless transmission and which was the only way one could access the IFE as on the flight there are no personal TV's. The crew were young and pleasant but embarrassingly unsophisticated and inexperienced as proven even when making scripted announcements and mangling them. Most of the time they were unsure how to make themselves heard on the cabin speaker system and their reading skills were not evident. One thing that was consistent with Air Canada's business class product is the insipidly awful catering. The breakfast was the same tired taste challenged over-salted omelette and chicken sausage Air Canada has been serving seemingly for the last decade. Sadly Rouge is now the only Air Canada carrier on the Las Vegas route unless one flies United who offer an inferior business class product but often for a lot less money than Air Canada charges even for Premium Rouge.

We fly Orlando to Toronto twice a year every year and until this last trip it was on Air Canada. AC is a decent airline and a relatively comfortable experience. This was our first experience with Rouge and what a huge disappointment! The seats are extremely cramped both legroom and between seats. It was a full flight. No TVs on the backs of seats but you can connect your mobile device to their limited Wi-Fi "if" you download the AC app. at home. My laptop didn't fit on the cramped tray table (especially with the seat in front reclined) and the music was echoing so I gave up. My android phone couldn't connect. Positives: Plane was clean and the crew had fancy bowler hats. Business class is a joke with the same seats as cattle class except with a doily and a bit more space. I would pay extra to avoid Rouge.

Toronto to Punta Cana and back to Toronto. Rouge is the worst airline I have experienced. Absolutely no room and I have short legs. No entertainment system you must have an apple product in order to get movies this is so bizarre. The flight attendants were amateurs all they did was sit in the back of the plane and talk loudly during the whole trip. I will avoid any flights that use Rouge. Honestly the worst flight experience I have ever had.

We flew Air Canada Rouge Airbus to Samana. It is amazing how many seats can be crammed into an old old airplane. While not tall my knees touched the back of the seat in front of me. No video you must use your laptop or tablet and you have to pay for the service. No A/C power on the plane. When I asked the staff about this their response was my computer battery should last the 4.5 hours flight. The seats in my opinion were designed to provide the least amount of padding and comfort to allow for the absolute maximum number of seats in an aircraft. I will avoid Rouge flights in future at all costs for any flight over 15 minutes. Not up to Air Canada standard.
