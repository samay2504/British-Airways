### "customer should be respected"
My US Airways departure flight was late but I made it at the last moment to my connecting flight and they had all ready given my seat away. I went to customer service and they got me a connecting flight and nothing else. I spent 13 hours overnight in LAX waiting on my flight for the next morning and who wouldn't love to do that after a day of travelling? They didn't even offer me a food voucher or a cot to sleep on. I did contact customer service through their site and nothing, they said they would address the issue. You think they would at least have offered to pay for my bag on the return trip or given me a sandwich or something. Yes I did do economy but it was still over a $1000. And a customer should be respected because we're the one's who keep them in business.

### "behavior was unbelievable"
I've never been more infuriated at the lack of professionalism of any company in my life. I am flying with my grandmother who is 87yrs old. A airport staff member was helping me. When we got her to the entrance of the plane the US Airways flight attendants didn't offer her any help, did not walk her to her seat even after I asked them to, as I was struggling with luggage, and rolled their eyes when I handed them her purse. Their behavior was unbelievable and unacceptable. I would've gotten better service on a Greyhound.

### "staff were just plain rude"
The US Airways flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia were fine and so was my domestic flight to Memphis. However, my return flight via Charlotte to London Heathrow, was a complete nightmare. We taxied to the run way on time to me told by the captain that a fault (which he said they knew about and should have already been fixed earlier that day) had occurred, it was nothing serious and we would go back to the stand for the system to be rebooted, then we would be on our way. Well, the reboot took place, pushed back from the stand to be told the fuel switch over light had come back on and we would have to return to the stand for engineers to take another look as reboot hadn't worked. Sat on stand for ages, then the captain said anyone who wished to leave the plane, to rearrange connecting flights, or to stretch their legs was welcome to do so and return to the plane at anytime. I was travelling with my disabled mother, but was worried as my father was due to travel 2hrs to collect us at Heathrow, and due to the time difference was about to leave her home in the UK. I asked a stewardess if it would be OK to leave my mom on the plane while I just step outside to make a call. Her words were "no problem". I left the plane and was told I had to go past the barriers at the departure gate, which I duly did. I managed to contact my father and asked the ground crew if I could return to the plane. The man was so rude and said no way, can't get back on the plane unless we tell you. I tried to explain that wasn't how it was told to us and I had my disabled mother onboard the aircraft, he shrugged his shoulder and walked away. I then noticed a woman staff member, who was talking to another couple, I waited at a distance, no saying a word as I didn't want to interrupt their conversation, but the women staff member turned to me and said, "don't interrupt, I'll deal with you in a minute". I was totally stunned at her attitude. Well, eventually I did get back on the plane but only after explaining about my mother and what the captain and stewardess had said. Eventually everyone was allowed back on board as we were told the plane had been fixed. Again we pushed back to be told fault had reappeared and engineers were going to replace a value. Again we were told it was fixed, pushed back, and, you guessed it, fault reappeared. This time we were told by the captain, even if the plane could be fixed a new crew would have to be found as they were now illegal to fly. This took place over 6hrs! One half filled cup of water and a packet of pretzels were given within those 6hrs. Then came the announcement, the flight was cancelled. Everyone got off, but my mother needed a wheelchair which took ages to come so by the time we got out to the departure gate we were last in the queue. Eventually given a flight home, 24hrs later, told couldn't get us a hotel as NASCAR was in town, given a cot to sleep on and $20 in food vouchers, but this was after midnight and no food outlets were open. When it was bought to the staff attention, the lukewarm food from the plane was given to us. My mother couldn't sleep in the cot provided so spent a sleepless night in her wheelchair. This episode was a complete nightmare, most of the staff were just plain rude, with two exceptions of the ground crew at the departure gate.

### "flight attendants are rude"
I was traveling with my girlfriend to Vegas and then onto San Diego for a short 5 day vacation. When I booked my flights I had the option of selecting my seat assignments. We chose to sit in the emergency exit rows or as close to the front as possible. After I chose the seats, the airline confirmed they were our seats. When we left out of Akron Canton airport we were in the last row of the airplane. No big deal. It was a 1.25 hour flight to our connection. The next flight they didn't even have us sitting next to each other. She was two rows behind me on the opposite side of a full plane, with both of us having middle seats. Nobody trades you seats for a middle seat. We had three planes to board out of San Diego on our way home. Not one time were the seats next to each other. Why offer me a opportunity to reserve my seats and then not give them to me. Was it because someone paid the extra fee to take my seats? Probably. I sent US Airways an email to ask them why this happened. Their response was sorry, I hope you choose to fly with us in the future. The flight attendants are rude. The customer service is horrible. There is no chance I will fly with them again. On this trip we flew from Vegas to San Diego on Southwest. I had never flown with them before. I was always leery about flying budget airlines. Never again will I fly US Airways.

### "displeasure of flying US Airways"
I had the displeasure of flying US Airways on Monday October 12th. My flight was suppose to leave Sacramento and connect in Phoenix with my final destination of Austin. After boarding the flight in Sacramento at 5:35 am for a 6:05 departure we were told there was a maintenance issue that would take a few minutes. The few minutes became an hour resulting in a delay in takeoff and a late arrival to Phoenix and me missing my connection to Austin by mere minutes (I arrived at the gate at 8:37am and the flight left at 8:46am). As a result I had to be rebooked and was told I was rebooked on a flight at 6:45pm resulting in spending the entire day in the airport and missing work and several appointments. This may have been easier to take if customer service had been good but it was not and their employees were rude, brisk and unapologetic. I will absolutely never fly US Airways or American Airlines again. Customer service goes a long way when situations occur and this airlines is lacking it in spades!

### "rude and unwilling to help"
My flight from Philadelphia to Providence was cancelled because they used the airplane from my flight for another flight. After waiting in a 2 hour long line at Customer Service, I was told that there were no flights out until the following afternoon (almost 24 hours from my original flight time), that I would not be put up in a hotel for the night because "none were available", and that they had no responsibility to find alternate travel methods for me. I am an 18 year old college student, and I was hours away from home and an hour from school. The representative I spoke with was rude and unwilling to help me. I will not travel with US Airways again, because of their lack of care for their customers. There should be no tolerance for making customers sleep in an airport all night long, when they are meant to provide alternate accommodations. I am very displeased.

### "Felt like the 70's"
I never write reviews but I feel compelled to write after experiencing US Airways appalling bad service from Philadelphia to Amsterdam. Flew on 21st September, the flight was on time. Beyond that it was a nightmare. They fly a Boeing 757 aircraft on this route, with 3x3 seat configuration in economy (business didn't look much better). The flight attendants can barely fit down the aisle. In fact, one of them suggested writing a review! Very little overhead space and people trying to cram their things in. The in flight entertainment system was a single movie shown on drop down screens above the aisle. Felt like the 70's. Just horrible. So if you're going to Amsterdam, I would suggest avoiding US Airways out of PHL at all costs.

### "missed my connecting flight"
This is my third time this year flying with US Airways and American Airlines and this is the third time my flight has been delayed or cancelled. Most recently, there was a delay of one hour without any reason, therefore delaying everyone for their connecting flights. I missed my connecting flight and they had no sympathy whatsoever. Only flights were the next day and they wouldn't give me any compensation for their failures. Never again US airways. Never.

### "had not been assigned a seat"
I booked a US Airways flight through Expedia and noticed I had not been assigned a seat. I called to get a seat assignment and was told that I could not be pre-assigned a seat among the seats remaining, unless I paid a fee. This is outrageous. I have already paid for a ticket. They have to give me a seat. So why can't I call and choose among the remaining seats. I was told it would not be fair to other passengers, but that doesn't make sense. Other passengers could call ahead, too, if they wished. US Airways just wants an excuse to charge people extra for seats they have already paid for. That is what is unfair. From now on I will look carefully and only book flights on airlines that pre-assign seats or allow one to choose seats when they book, a choice US Airways does not give passengers who book on Expedia. This is an unpleasant surprise to passengers who would like to sit with their spouse or other traveling companion. On top of this, the phone representative was rude.

### "showed no concern for passenger"
US Airways is my worst experience on an airline ever. Left Ft Myers Friday night, land Charlotte to find my connecting flight was canceled. Service area was manned by one person, other where on break. I ask for a supervisor he would not approach me or asked what he could do. I approached him, and ask if he new flight was canceled. He told me no he did not know. I asked I knew by text message, and he was not notified. He told me his radio was off and he did not know. He showed no concern for the passenger and just walked away. Spent the night in Charlotte and board a plane to Williamington to get connecting flight to Philly. Sat on plane waiting for co-pilot and for them to replace a bad tire. Took off an hour late, we arrived in time to see the Philadelphia plane leave. They rebooked us one another flight that has now been delayed. 24 hours and still waiting to get to Philadelphia. I may get there in time to catch my return flight back to Fort Myers. Also they have no idea where my bag is, with a checked fire arm.

### "never fly this carrier again"
US Airways will guarantee you the worst experience you will ever have! In the last 2 weeks I have had to get a rental car and hotel to get to where I was going due to overbooking (2 times in 2 weeks). Even with confirmed seats stated on my boarding pass, I still didn't have a seat according to the desk clerk. And than to be told that they would get you on a flight the next day. However they will not pay for the hotel so your choice is pay for it yourself or sleep in the airport. My job requires me to travel frequently and I understand things happen - but every time with US Air? I will never fly this carrier again.

### "flight was changed 3 times"
I booked the flight 6 months ago so that part of my vacation would be taken care of. The flight was changed 3 times, and each time the seats where my wife and I sat together were disturbed. I had to call and reset the seating so that we would sit together. The 3rd time, the American Airlines part of the US Airways flight, I was told that I could no longer sit next to my wife unless I paid a $10 upgrade fee for her to sit next to me. Are you kidding me, you made me sit on the phone for half an hour, for the 3rd time because you changed the seats around, and now you are going to charge me to have my wife sit next to me? This is just incompetence. I will never consider US Airways/American Airlines again.

### "absolutely the worst experience"
Absolutely the worst experience I've had traveling. Weather caused cancellation of second leg so US Airways rebooked on this flight. Supposed to board 1:30 and here it is 3:18 - we haven't started boarding yet - first no crew, than maintenance check - extra hour plus. Plus, we unexpectedly have a 90 mile drive once we get there because of this debacle. We will never fly this or American Airlines again. Plenty of other options.

### "no positives with US Airways"
There were no positives with US Airways. If I wanted delayed flights, missed connection, dirty planes, and horrible customer service, I'd fly Spirit for half the price. The customer service was horrible and flight was late on the trip to and from Portland. The staff were brusque, as if their passengers were annoyances rather than customers. Return flight was so delayed we missed our flight. US Airways was extremely unhelpful. It took an inordinate amount of time to get them to find us another flight (6 hrs later). They were unwilling to even try booking us through to PDX via a different connection. 0 stars.

### "will fly Delta next time"
US Airways from Phoenix to Boston in First class. My seat and the seat of the lady in back of me were clearly broken. Mine could not have the seatback brought fully up and clearly had a huge impression on the seat from a very heavy person. This made me "roll" into the center right of the seat the whole time. No IFE in first class. For the money you pay you would expect music at the very least. You have to log into GoGo and pay the extra. No access to the Admirals Club in the airport. This is just disgraceful. I was told (after having to wait 10 minutes for 2 customer service agents to finish a personal conversation) it would be $50 dollars a person extra. Outrageous. The food was marginal, not bad but not great either. On the flight to Phoenix it was slightly better. On the way back to Boston both meal selections were olive based dishes. Come on guys give someone a non-olive choice. The made to order ice Sundays were good. When we got in they had a problem hooking up the jetway so everyone was standing for about 10 minutes. In the middle of this, one of the ground crew mistakenly pulled the APU cord which cut all the lights - so we were in the dark. The pilot started yelling at the ground crew (not very professional). Clearly no team at work here. Check in staff in Phoenix were very nice and helpful. Less so in Boston but not bad. Will fly Delta next time.

### "international flight was slightly better"
Minneapolis to Frankfurt via Philadelphia on US Airways. Already at check-in the experience was shocking. They made me remove 4 lbs from my bag, although I could have had another trolley as carry-on luggage. The alternative was to pay 100 USD for 4 lbs of excess luggage. This is bordering extortion. The aircraft to PHL was very poor in terms of its cabin appearance, run down and dirty, too. The international flight was slightly better with rather friendly, German speaking cabin crew. The touch-screen to manage the inflight-entertainment was a 'little-shop-of-horrors' in terms of handling. It took countless attempts to choose the correct channel and the precision of the touch-screen was totally erratic - also with my fellow-passengers. Food was acceptable as airline food can be.

### "Take your money elsewhere"
When boarding the US Airways plane, I was notified that I was bumped from my seat (which I choose carefully as to make a connecting flight) to the very last row because another, completely unrelated passenger didn't book their accommodations correctly! Now as I wait at the very back of the plane, hoping and praying that the penalizing seat change wouldn't cause me to miss my connecting flight, I overhear a very loud and inappropriate conversation between the stewardess. US Airways obviously doesn't care about their customers. If they did they would have taken care of my concerns at the time they were occurring. I never received an apology for the inconvenience. I have written several reviews detailing my bad experience with US Airways and will continue to do so. Take your money elsewhere and enjoy the experience.

### "my worst experience ever "
Been flying regularly for over a decade and this trip on US Airways from Orlando to Chicago via Charlotte without question my worst experience ever - by a wide margin. Forced me to check my carry on, despite plenty of room remaining in overheads then broke my souvenirs. Delay required me to run through the airport and desk staff was unsympathetic and rather short with me when I asked about the bags I was forced to check.

### "lot of lost bags for no reason"
US Airways from New York JFK to Charlotte was horrible. Just watched as they made at least 20 people check their carry on, because no more space available in overhead. Then walked on the plane to see many empty overhead compartments. A lot of lost bags for no reason! Get your information correct before inconveniencing so many.

### "my vacation has been ruined"
US Airways was an hour late taking off, almost making me miss the connection to Frankfurt. I barely made my flight, but my luggage did not. The agent at the airport initially said it did and had me walk to the other side of the area, where it was not there. The second agent informed me that it was still in Philly but would get to me the next day. It did not. In a multitude of calls, I was informed it got to Frankfurt and they would forward to Paris immediately with no cost spared, then was informed that it was already in Paris, then still in Philly, then in Paris, then in Frankfurt and again in Paris. I gave an address 4-5 times and every call included them saying they didn't have one. Agents swore every day that I would have it. I had planned to travel around but my once in a lifetime vacation has been hijacked and ruined by having to spend loads of money to stay in one place and hours for luggage that never arrives. Safe to say I will never fly US Airways again. Telling me to go buy clothes is unacceptable - I did not travel a full day to get to Paris to shop for socks.

### "a long time before we book US Airways again"
We booked and paid in advance two US Air round trip tickets form DTW to SFO with a stop over in PHX. We received a e-mail shortly before our departure, informing us that our schedule times had changed on both dates. On the return flight they were leaving us in Phoenix with no flight back to Detroit, also the times didn't work for our scheduled Trafalgar tour. We called US Air several times and received a message saying they were busy and to call back. After getting another number we received a message telling us to stay on the line for the next available representative. After one hour and 10 minutes of listening to their terrible music, someone answered. We were informed that there were no flights from Phoenix to Detroit, after we had paid for a round trip ticket. After much wrangling we decided to leave the tour a day early and get a $95.00 shuttle from Monterey to SFO to make an early flight. When arriving at SFO we were informed that our flight was delayed, making our connection in Phoenix impossible. The agent worked diligently and got us a flight, SFO, Philadelphia, Detroit. Needless to say it will be a long time before we book US Airways again.

### "window seats on exit row should be removed"
US Airways from OGG (Kahului, Maui) to Phoenix Sky Harbor. There were no pair of economy seats available together online. Traded 2 Seat "E"s 4 rows apart for row 27, seats E/F. Was told only it was an exit row. Flight was a redeye, hoped to sleep, as it lasted 6 hours. Spouse, (about 5 feet tall, less than 90 lbs) sat in seat F. We could not get comfortable - armests would not raise, seats were very narrow - for me, For my wife, window area was cold, no pillows were available, and she had no legroom due to protruding window slide cover. She had to turn towards me and put her legs on top of mine. I could not get something to drink, as I then could not use the tray table. US Airways would rather couples pay for preferred, choice, or 1st class seating, than provide enough regular priced coach seats. The window seats on the exit row should be removed.

### "flights were spacious, and service okay"
Recently we have been to Orlando from Philly. Our flight got delayed by 2 hours and we got the notification call just 40 mins before the departure. Obviously we were not happy with this. During our return flight, we had one stop and we missed the first one. It was US Airways flight but managed by American Airlines now I guess. I approached the ground staff and told them how we missed it. When I was preparing myself to pay extra money, to my pleasant surprise they gave us different flight with no extra charge. We were so happy that we would use American Airlines (US Airways) in our next tour again. Apart from that flights were spacious, and service was okay. More courteous behaviour from crew would make it more attractive.

### "nice meal service, friendly staff"
Manchester Airport check in queues terrible at T3. Good thing there is the web check in around the corner. Gate area needs more queuing space. Flight delayed 45 mins, did quick turnaround but still delayed out. Friendly crew. Comfy leather seats, nice meal service, friendly staff. Philadelphia immigration was terrible this time. Bags were waiting for us on the floor, how nice. Had to make a quick connection. Walked through station to B security instead of using A-East. Boarding was good, comfy seats, long drink service, took an hour. Tampa is a great airport. Bags delayed due to thunder. At airport until 8pm, when we had hoped to be in Orlando.

### " treated in such an obnoxious way"
A very bad experience on our US Airways flights Bangor to Tampa via Philadelphia. The plane leaving Bangor lost the air conditioning on the runway, had to go back for repairs. Hot plane, no communication from the captain or crew about what was going on. Late to Philadelphia, we ran to C terminal, Gate 20 and arrived 14 minutes before departure. A very rude gate agent had just given away our first class seats to two people already on board even though there was a line to board of about 30 people. She refused to honor our seats even though we'd paid for them and had boarding cards. We have never been treated or threatened in such an obnoxious way. Although we paid for first, we rode in the back of the plane. Our recent experiences with US Airways have been getting worse.

### US Airways customer review
In 2013 we paid extra to fly non stop to San Diego, an hour before our flight while in transit, we get an alert our flight was canceled. Now in  they move our departing flight out an hour and move our returning flight out an hour with no alerts or notice. On both trips, even though we booked our seats so our family would sit together, they split us up. So my 14 year old daughter had to sit next to strangers on both flights. When we asked the staff to switch seats they ignored us.

### US Airways customer review
I flew from Phoenix to Lima through Mexico City without problems. However on the return trip, there was a major delay in the airport in Mexico City (caused by the government), causing me to miss my connecting flight. The man at the counter was rude, but eventually provided me with a continuation of my journey which included a new flight through Puerto Vallarta and an overnight stay. Once I tried to board from Puerto Vallarta, they told me that, because of the change in flight, it was no longer an international flight and therefore I would have to pay an  additional baggage fees. Although I provided documentation that this was part of the Phoenix, Lima trip, she didn't care and became rude when I pressed the issue. The flight crew were fine, and airplane was normal. Just that the ticketing people are completely unreasonable and rude.

### US Airways customer review
Round Trip. Both flights had good crew, though the outbound crew were much more interactive as a daytime flight. Food excellent on outbound and certainly good on the return. Great seat in 1-2-1 configuration. Small delays on both legs, but arrived within half an hour of scheduled time. In all respects better than the BA option through London, which I frequently use.

### US Airways customer review
First-the flight was rescheduled from 10.10pm departure to 12.20am due to no pilots to fly the plane. Boarding starting at midnight and was fully boarded before the pilots showed up - first pilot at 12.20am and second pilot at 12.24am. Second-only a blanket was available for each passenger, no pillows available on an all-night flight. Third-no beverages were made available even in first class. Fourth-at no time did any of the crew apologize for the delay or for the lack of amenities. Fifth-the plane itself had no electronics available at all - no video screens and no outlets for electronics - truly very Spartan. Sixth-at 7am EDT the first beverages were offered along with the "first class" continental breakfast which consisted of a small croissant roll, a packet of almond butter, a small tube of strawberry preserves, a wedge of cheese and a mint - not "first class" at all. Seventh-the flight landed and we left the aircraft at 8.58am EDT. In summary, I would not recommend US Airways as a source to use for night-time intercontinental flights. It was a ridiculous example of airline management and treatment of customers.

### US Airways customer review
The charade continues. We got up at 5.00am for a 7.50am flight that has now been delayed until at least 4.00pm with no guarantee that the flight will actually leave. No notification of the delay was sent to passengers, no offer to place passengers on other flights or airlines was made, no compensation was offered for the inconvenience or to losing hotel in LA. As some attempt at a sop, we have each been offered a $10.00 lunch voucher to be redeemed at one of the departure lounge junk-food outlets. And as if that isn't insulting enough, as two passengers' names were included on the voucher, the junk-food outlet refused to honour the $10.00 for the second passenger. So, back to the airline counter to wait for another 15 or 20 minutes before being told that US Airways had run out of vouchers. The ineptitude is extraordinary.

### US Airways customer review
Never before have I encountered an airline with less interest in its customers. 1) Passengers were not informed of a 3 hour delay forcing us to wake at 5.00am for a 7.50am flight and then wait in the airport departure lounge until 10.15am. 2) It is now 1.11pm, we are still in the departure lounge and the flight has been delayed until 4.00pm with no guarantee of departure. 3) No attempt has been made to transfer passengers to other flights or airlines - worse, it was actively opposed. 4) No attempt has been made to compensate passengers for LA day hotel and other expenses incurred. 5) No attempt has been made to soften the inconvenience by providing access to the Lounge or other customer service.

### US Airways customer review
Very frustrating experience with gate attendant mandating the checking of bags at the gate when overhead space still available. Caused the inability to take original delayed flight through DC and delaying arrival by hours. Delays happen just wish guest service from this airline could provide recovery.

### US Airways customer review
I was due to travel from Philadelphia to Brussels (direct flight) at 6:20pm 17 August. The flight was delayed for 2 hours before they informed us that the aircraft needed to be changed. After the aircraft was changed and we actually took off, 20 minutes into the flight, there was a technical problem and we were informed that the plane had to return to Philadelphia. After we returned to the airport, we were told that there was another plane ready for us, and were left there for 3 hours waiting for a crew to arrive. In the end there was no crew and the flight was cancelled. It took another 3 hours to rebook everyone on different flights. It was disorganised chaos with no guidance whatsoever as to how to get vouchers and how to get to our hotels. It was 4am by the time we got to our hotel. I was rebooked on a flight to Brussels via Munich due to depart at 6:30pm on 18 August. After boarding was completed we were told that there was a technical problem - were left on the plane for 1.5 hours without any update. Eventually we were told to disembark and to board another plane. This was the 3rd plane with technical issues in a period of 24 hours. We eventually departed at 10pm. The staff on the flight were extremely rude and patronising. The inflight entertainment was a nightmare to use as the touch screen was pretty much not working. I would definitely not recommend this airline.

### US Airways customer review
We flew from Hartford to Jacksonville via Charlotte and return. Every flight was on time. All US Airways staff were efficient and pleasant. Seats were comfortable and just enough distance apart. We will fly with them again.

### US Airways customer review
The flight from Boston to Philadelphia (A319) was under an hour, so I didn't expect much service, but the legroom was terrible. The flight from Philly to Tel Aviv (A330) was awful, it felt almost like a school bus. The entertainment was okay, but the food was some of the worst I have eaten. We sat in row 22, right in front of the bathroom which kept me up all night. I got 1 hour of sleep on an 11 hour flight. 10 days later, we flew back to Philadelphia on the same aircraft. It was the exact same experience, (minus the bathroom as we were sitting a few rows up) plus incredibly rude flight attendants. We landed pretty early, so waited on the tarmac for quite a while. After some time, I started to feel the urge to go to the bathroom. After 15 minutes I got up to use the bathroom. At that time, a flight attendant turned around and shouted at me "sit down, you can't get up yet". We still didn't move for another 5 minutes. The flight from Philadelphia to Boston (CRJ-200) was pretty much a typical regional flight—cramped but short.

### US Airways customer review
We booked a flight on US Airways from PHL-YYZ. Flight lasted 1.5 hours. Ground service and in-flight service was so-so. In-flight entertainment was pretty good because I looked out the window and saw the CN-Tower. The problem was that they served very cold water that was mostly ice. At least the seats were comfortable.

### US Airways customer review
Flight from Augusta, GA to Omaha, NE with a 39 minute layover in Charlotte, NC. First flight out of Augusta was delayed 45 minutes for maintenance. Arrived 5 minutes late to the gate in Charlotte and missed the connection. Have been standing in the "customer service" line for 90 minutes, and just reached the halfway point. There are 7 available computers at customer service, but only 2 are ever being used at once. There have been a max of 4 Representatives, who seem to have coordinated it so that only two are ever available. I have already called customer service to try and expedite my time in this line, but they can only help with rescheduling the flight and not with the hotel. This has been the worst example of customer service I have ever experienced. Every interaction has left me with the feeling that this was somehow my fault, and I'm inconveniencing these workers by having to be dealt with.

### US Airways customer review
Arriving at Orlando airport there was nothing less than disorganized chaos by the check in. Staff were extremely slow for simple bag check-ins as well as unfriendly and unprofessional. Flight was delayed 4 hours because the crew needed time off. Does US Airways only have one crew available? The flight finally got off the ground 4 hours and 45 minutes later than scheduled. Because I was just taking a day trip to Philadelphia to drop off someone who had a 10 hour layover it ended up being a waste of money for me. For my return flight from Philadelphia they announced that there would be a 10 minute delay because - you guessed it - they were short on personnel. The 10 minutes turned into over an hour before they could get a first officer and 2 flight attendants. The service on board on both flights was poor. The attendants were cold and impersonal. The gate personnel at Orlando were the absolute unfriendliest I have seen in over 45 years of flying. US Airways used to be a good airline that I enjoyed flying with, but since the fusion they are just a shadow of what they used to be and even worse than their partner American Airlines. I won't be using them anytime in the near future again.

### US Airways customer review
I can't say enough good things about the customer service I received on 20 July from their staff. Kayak had screwed things up with my reservation, but US Airways helped me out and showed compassion and efficiency. This is not the first time I have spoken to them and they have given me such good service. I appreciate it so much and that is why I am writing this review. I haven't flown yet, but they have made it possible for me and took care of the mess that Kayak caused. I actually haven't traveled yet, but have to fill out the fields below - I am hoping I am correct giving four stars (as I rarely, if ever, give five).

### US Airways customer review
Returning to LAX on family holiday trip from San Juan PR was a nightmare: Plane left late from SJU arrived at CLT (Charleston, NC) almost on time - but - plane sat on tarmac for 40 minutes, resulting in missed flight to LAX, last flight of the night. Rebooked for same flight - 24 hours later. No vouchers, no food coupons, no apologies. Delays were admittedly due to weather in CLT and air traffic control response, but given that trip was booked all legs through AA/US Airways, would have thought airline could hold last flight for connecting passengers known to be waiting on tarmac for gate to make connections. Many upset AA/US Airways passengers were in evidence at Charlotte "International" Airport. Additionally, rampant, repeated misinformation and; unhelpfulness from US Airways/American Airlines customer service and airport staff. Were told by airport staff at gate we could reclaim luggage at baggage claim - could not be more wrong, they would not "pull bags" so I, wife and 2 kids stuck in Charlotte for 24 hours. Moreover, had purchased $200 liquor in Duty Free in SJU, but, due to TSA regulations and because we left the secure area, have had to improvise and box bottles for check-through on rescheduled flight - another $25 fee too boot. Don't know if they'll let me check (am writing from a hotel near airport during my 24 hour "layover"). Even better - flight crew was at baggage claim and unable to find accommodation for the night - so AA/US Airways not only jerking around customers but crew as well (not surprisingly). You'd think they'd have contingency plan for these sort of events as a rested flight crew is allegedly critical to FAA safety requirements, but they were in the same pickle as we - completely and utterly out of luck! Was loyal AA booster and flier for years, even enjoyed "Sapphire" status at one point, but will never fly AA/US Airways again if there is a-n-y other option.

The check-in process was good, flight on time, comfortable seats. My major concern was the flight attendants we encountered. Out of four flights on this trip, we only had one attendant that we did not overhear complain about the airline. We sat in exit rows on all the flights, and in seats that allowed conversation with them. We specifically chose a window seat for one of our legs of the trip, but the flight attendant made a mistake and thought we were in the wrong seat because another passenger thought he had the window seat exit row. The attendant told us we were wrong, so we made the move per request, then quietly pointed out we had been in the correct seats all along. The attendant apologized, but didn't ask the other passenger to move to his ticketed seat. My husband had circulation problems, so we specifically wanted the seat we had requested as it allowed more leg room. When the beverage cart came by, we did ask for a complementary rum and coke to compensate us, which we did receive. I would have to think twice before flying with US Airways again.

### US Airways customer review
Not only are the flight attendants rude, but the service is terrible. I took a simple 1.5 hour flight that was supposed to leave at 12 pm. Nope - cancelled, placed on a connecting flight at 2.45, arrive, have my gate changed to the other side of the airport without prior notification and then the connecting flight to my final destination was delayed three times. Low and behold I arrived at my destination at 9.30 in the evening. Would not take again.

### US Airways customer review
$25 for each checked bag is definitely a negative in my book. The flight itself should include your luggage fee. The way this airline does seating is entirely asinine - you can book your flight at any time, but you have to wait until within two weeks of the flight to actually pick your seats. The flight was very loud and the lights and air conditioners at each seat were difficult to adjust, at some points feeling as if they would break if you tried to point the air toward you. Snacks all have to be paid for rather than being included, which also seems ridiculous when the flight already costs so much. I probably will never voluntarily fly with US Airways (or American Airlines for that natter) in the future. Other airlines have free bag checks and plenty of snacks on board at no extra cost.

### US Airways customer review
Delayed due to hydraulic issue. We're not given any food or drinks as outlined in their policy. Missed connection to Glasgow and were put on same flight the following day. Despite the fact they advertise as being part of one world they could not fly us to Glasgow via London as they are not partners with British Airways. Queried food and drinks policy only to be told they were not a canteen service and wouldn't be looking after a grown man! Had to fight to get food voucher - $10! Needed to get dinner, breakfast and lunch before the flight. Couldn't even get our luggage out of baggage reclaim. Sent to a terrible run down hotel. Not exactly the end we wanted to the holiday we wanted!

### US Airways customer review
US Airways, though merged with American still retains the legacy of being the worst carrier when it comes to service. I am not complaining that they don't provide any food or baggage services etc. but basic courteous behavior among the staff was absent. My flight was after 8/00pm and when asked why the food items listed on the inflight menu were not available, I was rudely told that the timings are mentioned in the menu. The steward could have told me this more politely. I flew on American on DFW-BOS leg and at least they gave me a full can of beverage but while flying on aircraft operated by US Airways, I was served only a small quantity of the beverage in a glass filled mostly with ice.

### US Airways customer review
My main complaint is as follows: On my return flight I upgraded my seats to the emergency exit row for more room (their seats are horribly uncomfortable - the worst I've experienced). If you're tall or overweight you are in for a world of pain. I upgraded my seats, and then they ended up putting me on another airline because my original connecting flight in Dallas was having maintenance issues and I wouldn't have made it home. They put me on an Alaska flight from Chicago to PDX in the middle seat for 4.5 hours. To add insult to injury, they still charged me for the upgrade even though I had to switch airlines. Essentially, I was charged $95 more for a considerably worse seat.

### US Airways customer review
Our flight to Charlotte was delayed due to weather in Charlotte. The pilot and flight attendants told us there was going to be a minimum of one hour delay and probably more. They never advised us to check back every 15 minutes like they are supposed to do as I found out later. We went to get something to eat and when we came back in much less than an hour we found the plane had left without us. It also left with our valuable instruments we had gate checked! We finally convinced the customer service lady to please have somebody meet the plane and store the instruments until we could finally get there. The return trip was no better as they cancelled us from the return flight because we had missed our original flight from Phoenix. We had to fight to get back on the plane. The return flight was no better! If you fly US Air be ready to hear "We are so sorry but your flight has been delayed because of 'insert reason' and we will get you in the air as soon as possible". I heard this so many times when I was stranded in the airport in Phoenix. The flight attendants don't really care either and the whole company seems to display this kind of attitude.

### US Airways customer review
Boarding the flight was on time, quick and efficient. The flight into Chicago was a few minutes early allowing me plenty of time to get to the gate for my connecting flight. Boarding the flight to Philadelphia was also on time, quick and efficient. This leg of my flight arrive 30 minutes ahead of schedule. My return flight from Philadelphia to New Orleans was a direct flight and arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. I have never experienced any problems flying US Airways and can only hope that now that American Airlines operates all the flights, they will continue to excel in customer service.

### US Airways customer review
Short hop from BWI to PHL as part of a long haul connection from PHL-DOH-KUL. What a dreadful airline! From beginning to end, it was such a hassle for a 25 minute flight. At BWI, they insisted that you check in at a kiosk to obtain a boarding pass prior to check in. Despite telling them it was an international flight with a transfer connection and one party was on a wheelchair, they still insisted. The kiosk rejected my attempts, wasting about 20 minutes of my time. At check in, the staff were rude and insisted that my bags were over the weight limit despite travelling in on a business class ticket. Finally, she relented, printed off my boarding pass only to have it rejected by the TSA agent as the bar code was not printed properly. Then there was no one to push the wheelchair for my travelling partner so I took it upon myself to do so as they were closing the flight. I was told off by the check in agent for not arriving earlier but I pointed out that we had been there on time but wasted 20 minutes at the kiosk and another 20 minutes queuing to check in. On the short flight, there was no beverage service but that is a small matter. On the whole, I will do everything possible to avoid US Air in the future. Ground services were appalling.

### US Airways customer review
This was the most horrible experience. We were trying to leave BWI, when we got a phone call saying we were an hour delayed. Okay, it happens. Someone from the airline was checking the people with connecting flights to make sure they could still make it, he said we "should" make it. Well, we had a gut feeling "should" wasn't enough so we went to another counter. They said we would have to change our flight because we would only have 4 minutes to make it to a gate on the other side of the airport before the flight departed. We wouldn't have eaten calmly and taken our time to do things if we were told that to begin with! So they tell me we will have to stay an extra 5 hours sitting at the airport to our connecting flight or that we would have to pay for a hotel and stay the night in Charlotte, they wouldn't pay, but regardless I had to be in Charleston that night. So I asked to be refunded because it was not sounding like great options. There was a sweet lady that helped us and told us to let the flight attendant know we had to make our earlier flight as soon as we landed. However when we got onto the plane about 2 hours later, they delayed us another 30 minutes because of traffic. We wanted to leave, I would make it driving down south faster than flying (and a lot cheaper), but a nice lady on the plane saw how upset we were and helped calm us down. She then explained that we wouldn't be able to make it to our earlier flight, but that we could ask the help desk to get us seats on the 10:30 flight, or have the airline pay for our hotel to leave the next morning because the delay was due to "maintenance" issues. We had no choice so she met us as we landed and tried to help us find an airport nearby our original location for a friend to pick us up at. Her shift was over and was beyond sweet for helping us for so long. She actually found us a flight leaving 15 minutes after we landed but they wouldn't have been able to deliver our luggage. So we took the seats on the 10:30 flight and of course without sitting together (I get anxious so I always need someone, so my fiancé and I were upset). We sat there and of course, they say they have to change a tire that would take a bother 30 minutes. That whole trip ended up totaling 11 hours after delays, maintenance, and layover. The worst $700 spent for a mediocre travel that could have been avoided if they had their act together.

Flights on time. Baggage handling was fine this time around. Snacks were provided. Toilets were clean, overall inflight experience was fine, if not better than my previous flights with American Airlines/US Airways. I would fly with this carrier again.

### US Airways customer review
US Airways Express. We arrived very early for an afternoon flight  and asked if possible to change to earlier flight. Customer service lady very kind and helpful - changed it to 11.15 am flight no extra charge. Boarding smoothly, small plane. Allocated 2 seats and prefer that configuration. Only 1 flight attendant with a good sence of humour. We were unaware that flight from Philadelphia to New York was only 19 minutes so quickest flight we have ever been on. Only negative is we prefer life jackets in case of emergency not flotation cushions on bottom of seats. The main thing is we arrived safely.

### US Airways customer review
I got to the airport early and the flight was on time. We boarded the airplane and taxied onto the tarmac. We sat on the tarmac for around 45 minutes, and then got an announcement that we had to go back to the terminal for maintenance issues. We were told we had a minimum wait time of 45 minutes and that we could get off the plane if we wanted. I got off the plane to go get some food, when we were called back to the plane we had to re-board. Re boarding took about 20 minutes. Luckily we got onto the tarmac without any trouble. We had a normal flight and landed in LA three hours late. We were about to go to a terminal when we were told that since we were late we had to wait a minimum of 45 minutes to get a terminal. We had to wait for 1.5 hours. Overall, not a very good experience.

### US Airways customer review
We left Cancun on an A321 plane heading to Philadelphia with no issues. However, at Philadelphia after we collected our luggage to put them on the next track for our connecting flight, we then found out our next flight was cancelled. The people at baggage were unaware of this, no announcement, nothing. We only found out from a digital board after giving our luggage away. We then went back to see if there was a chance in receiving our luggage so it wouldn't leave without us and the response from a US Airways worker was "no sorry" when asked if there were any other flights that night through this airline again the response was "no the next is 9.20 tomorrow", we asked if there was a different airline to our final destination we again heard "no there's not" not very helpful at all! We also asked if there was any way to get reimbursed for a car rental or a hotel for the night and again, "no we can't do that sorry" why not? That's just the question. It isn't our fault the flight was cancelled. The least they could do was announce it.

Took family on trip from Chicago to Las Vegas. Arrived at O'Hare Ticket counter 1 hour prior to departure. Took 15 minutes to go through line and complete auto-ticketing system. At end of check in screen flashed "Unable to complete check-in. Went to agent about message when she loudly stated "You're too late. You should have arrived earlier. We might get you on the next flight (3 hours later). Nowhere did it state on their web-site that you would not be able to board your flight unless you arrived at ticket counter at least 1 hour prior to flight. We were in line at least 60 minutes prior to flight, and completed automated process 45 minutes prior. At least 15 others not allowed to board. Staff at Phoenix were friendly and apologetic. Ironically we were warned not to fly with US Air by a frequent business flyer but thought, how bad could it be? Well now we know.

### US Airways customer review
Here are the basics: flight delayed twice, no sign change put up at the gate, over 100 people waiting in line for over and hour, since the sign said it was boarding the entire time with no announcement. 25 People waiting in line to book a new connecting flight since the now delayed flight (which we had to figure out on our own) would make everyone miss their connection, we are not spoken to, rather told to board the plane with a "50/50 shot you could rebook your connection in Dallas. Get to Dallas, no flights until the next day, and we have to pay for our hotel room? What a wonderful way to end my vacation. Never again will my money go towards this airline or their partners.

### US Airways customer review
We're flying US Airways for the second time in two weeks and I'm not impressed! Both times the flight from Phoenix to Tampa was delayed due to maintenance issues. Are the planes in that bad shape or is there something else going on such as scheduling difficulties? It would be easier to take if the employees were a little more accommodating and apologetic instead of downright rude.

### US Airways customer review
Our travel on Monday, June 8, 2015 on flight #444 from Cabo San Lucas to Phoenix, Arizona with connecting flight of #422 to Omaha, Nebraska same day. As we were waiting for our flight in Cabo, the gate numbers were changed four times, everyone seemed confused and no information was given to passengers other than it had been delayed and moved. Finally the plane left about 45 minutes late due to maintenance problems. No information was given to us that we would not make our connecting flight to Omaha. No information was given on the plane. No information was given when we disembarked and headed for Customs. No information given that the gate of our connecting flight had been changed. We were uninformed of any changes! We ran to our gate of B26 for flight #422, we made it and found no one there. We finally found a monitor and found that it had just been changed to A6 at the opposite side of the airport. As we ran (I had paid $50 for priority boarding because I had a knee injury…and was running the injured knee) we made it to the gate – the door was still open and personnel were standing at the gate. We all (9 others) were glad to have made our flight. We were told 1) that there were no empty seats. 2) we were too late and it was our fault. 3) then after pressuring the attendant, she found that our seats had been given to other people and that we had been put on another flight #462 to Dallas and then #5675 to Omaha the following day. Staff were rude and unhelpful.

### US Airways customer review
This airline is extremely inefficient and ineffective. Out of four flights taken in the last 3 days, only one was on time. The others were delayed by an hour or more. For one of them, online it said our plane was arriving from Chicago, the phone representative said it was coming from Los Angeles, and the gate attendant said it arrived from Montego Bay. It was delayed over an hour. Our plane from Charlotte to Myrtle Beach on June 29th at on the runway for an hour before turning back to the gate to replace a radio. Overall an extreme disappointment. I do not intend to fly this airline again nor recommend it.

### US Airways customer review
I'm currently stuck on my flight while writing this review. I've been sitting here in these rather uncomfortable seats for 1.5 hours because they need to get some paperwork signed for maintenance? That's not a good enough reason for me. Why is it not getting done? Obviously passengers are not a priority for this airline. To add, we were about to take off but we had to return to the gate because their maintenance crew didn't fully check everything. You think they'd do it right the first time.

### US Airways customer review
I have flown with US Airways several times and each experience has been a nightmare! Every trip has had a flight delay by an hour or more. Customer service is always rude and no one cares to help you or help make your travels easier! I try to avoid flying with them as much as possible unless I know I have no choice. I recently traveled to PHX from Charlotte and they delayed my flight for over an hour because of a "Maintenance" issue. It's a nightmare and I will no longer choose to travel with US. Horrible service and constant delays!

### US Airways customer review
I've flown US Airways many times and it always seems like there's some sort of problem. Delays, cancellations, overbooking etc have made it so there's always some issue when I fly with them. A couple of weeks ago, a flight was canceled for some unknown reason and I had to fly into a city that was two hours away from my destination instead of having to wait in the airport overnight for the next flight. For the latest example, my brother and I were flying out of NC and were told by the ticket agent that there were no seats left for us nor another person trying to fly to Charlotte. It's frustrating to be kicked off a flight that was so overbooked and there was no apology or compensation.

### US Airways customer review
I do not blame airlines for the bad weather on June 23rd. Flights were cancelled on the East Coast. However, I found the cabin staff very unfriendly and refusing to help. Due to reconnections because of the storm I boarded a flight from Hartford to Boston via Philadelphia. I arrived in Philadelphia late due to weather and then went to the gate to load connection to Boston. The guy taking tickets actually yelled at me for being late! Finally boarded plane and was looking for a place to put my overhead bag. There was a stewardess standing at the back of the plane and a steward standing in front. Neither one offered any assistance so I asked for help to locate a place to put my bag. I was told to just keep looking! Finally a young lady got up and moved her laptop so I could place my bag in the overhead. While struggling to lift my bag a gentleman sitting in a seat got up and helped me. Meanwhile the steward and stewardess were still standing in their spots! When I sat down the steward told people to put away their computers. A man sitting across from me started putting his away when the steward came back yelling at him because his was not putting his away fast enough! I understand that everyone was under stress but that is no reason to treat people rudely! Especially paying customers!

On my way back to Canada, I chose to fly US Airways since I made a last minute booking and didnt feel like paying a full Y class fare on Air Canada. I usually fly Air Canada and Star Alliance Partners, so I chose US Airways based on them being a former partner. I was surprised, comparing the flight to Canadian airlines such as Air Canada and Westjet. The Seats were not at all what I would have expected, there was no IFE system on A319 or CRJ, but that was expected on the CRJ. Cabin Crew was very nice and pleasent. There was a complimentary Beverage service and a la carte snacks, However I found $4 US for a small pack of Pringles and $7US for a Tiny Bottle of Heineken a little steep. Seeing as this was a Domestic flight, I would understand the lack of IFE. There weren't any onboard power outlets on any aircraft. My Laptop died halfway through my flight to Philly. Safety Briefing was done by the flight crew but it seemed that they were tired of doing it. Not many were paying attention and I believe a safety video would be more effective. For the value of what I paid for, I'd say it was very much worth it.

Arrived on Qatar Airways into Philadelphia from Doha and went on to BWI on a code share flight with US airways express. Short 30 minute flight but all went well. Small plane but surprisingly comfortable. Overhead storage was limited. One flight attendant who managed to serve about 25 people soft drinks. No complaints and the flight was on time

### US Airways customer review
With a weather forecast of thunderstorms at the time of my departure, I went to the airport four hours early to get on an earlier flight in order to make a tight connection. Despite the fact that there were open seats on the earlier flight I was not permitted to change flights. As predicted, the thunderstorms arrived, delaying my flight 1.5 hours, forcing me to miss my connection. As a result, I had to stay in a hotel at my own expense and get up at 4am to get to the airport for my new flight. When I got to the airport it was buzzing with stranded travelers waiting to check in. The US Airways kiosks were useless because they only accept boarding passes. It was chaos. I was barely able to make my flight. I hope to never fly on Eastern/US Airways or to flight through Charlotte, North Carolina ever again.

Ground staff in MUC was ok. Aircraft MUC-PHL was an A330-200, clean, nice leather seats. IFE was very good. Catering for Y class also excellent. Crew lacked happiness, rarely smiled but did their job. Flight touched down in PHL 3 minutes ahead of ETA given by crew on take off. PHL-CLT on A330-300. Aircraft showed its age, but crew was very friendly.

Price was the main reason I had booked this trip with US and based on the majority of the reviews I was not looking forward to the experience. How wrong could I have been. Boarded the 5 year old aircraft, an A330-200, on time and in an organised manner. Within 30 minutes crew came through with a drinks run. Wine and soft drinks free, with a fee for spirits. Lunch followed and was very tasty. Small salad, main chicken dish with a nice desert. Nothing spectacular but very edible for airplane food. The crew, all but one, seemed happy and cheerful and interacted with the passengers as they came through the cabin. They came through the cabin with another juice and water run about an hour later and after that we got an expected treat of chocolate ice cream. About an hour before landing in Charlotte we were given a tasty paninni snack and cupcake with an offer of another drink or tea or coffee. The entertainment system worked well and had a good choice of movies. I honestly could not fault these guys with the way they delivered the service and how they made an 8 hour flight fly by!

We were to fly home from Cabo San Lucas on June 8th, to make a connection with US Airways in Phoenix and then on to Omaha that same day. This turned into 2 days. From Cabo, the plane was late by almost an hour. They never mentioned changes to connecting flights nor that we would not make it - we made it to the plane but to our surprise and 9 others they sold our seats to other people. The door was open, the plane had not left but we were not allowed to board. We were told we had to wait and fly after midnight to Dallas and then Omaha the next day. We had to fight for overnight accomodation. We had no clothes - the bags beat us to Omaha. The courtesy counter and the gate people were rude and unhelpful.

I am 76 and require a cane to walk, our seats were changed after we had adjacent aisle assigned seats 5 months prior thru our travel advisor. My wife was put 12 rows behind me, I was put into a window seat between 2 bulkheads, I am 6'2" and 315 lbs - no room and cannot move my feet because bulkheads went to the floor. Tried to get the seat changed at the counter, after 40 minutes, they basically advised me to accept the seat or wait for another plane (to Portugal?). On board the service personnel were in a race to complete service and were somewhat rude to passengers, none of them seemed happy to be working that day. The plane had no video/TV screens and I had no tray available for the poor food service provided, could not even eat the "meal" provided. Talked to seatmate and found out his travel companion was also "relocated" elsewhere on the plane after they had seats together when they bought their tickets. My wife came up and changed seats with me the last half of the flight, found out that other passengers had their seating also changed at the last minute as well.

### US Airways customer review
The fight was oversold, both the departure and arrival gates were double booked, and baggage did not show for 45 minutes. This resulted in the travel time being extended by 2.5 hours. Every time I have flown US Airways similar situations have arisen. I do not recommend using this airline unless tickets are half the price of competitors.

### US Airways customer review
I will never be flying US Airways again. The flight I originally booked was only supposed to have a 4 hour layover in Phoenix, but I kept getting emails about schedule changes. On the day of my flight I was originally supposed to leave Phoenix for Hawaii at 4.55pm, which was a 8 hour layover. I was annoyed about the changes, but was prepared to deal with it. I then found out while at the Phoenix airport that my flight was delayed another 3 hours! But the nightmare wasn't over, about 2 hours later there was another delay for 1 hour - I was livid. I was originally supposed to arrive in Hawaii at 5.32pm. I'm now arriving at 12am. On top of that my seats on the flight coming back were messed up because of flight changes.

Flew MSP-PHL-LHR-DUS and returned DUS-TXL-ORD-MSP. The flights were a disaster from start to finish. First flight delayed out of MSP for 25 minutes. Ok that's understandable. But when we arrive in Philadelphia we are told we will have a short wait until our gate is cleared. This turns into a very long wait and we are on a tight connection. We ask the flight attendant if she could please contact our next flight and ask them to wait. She rudely says no and then offers no further response. When we finally deplaned we asked the agent at the gate if she could please contact our flight. All she did was give us directions on getting to the B concourse. After a sprint to the gate we barely make it on the final boarding call. Thankfully the flight to London was only 25% occupied at most and we were able to stretch out. The flight to DUS was with British Airways and went smoothly except for a slight 10 minutes delay. On the return flight our flight was cancelled with no reason given. We were lucky we checked early and immediately called customer service. They said they couldn't put us on another flight for about 3 hours until they finally caved in and put us on a flight departing in a few hours with Air Berlin meaning we got no sleep. The Air Berlin portion was fine. Anything operated by US or AA was a disaster but anything from their partners went fine. Lesson learned.

### US Airways customer review
I had a terrible experience with US Airways. I took them from Seattle to Amsterdam through Philadelphia. Here's what went wrong: They didn't provide me with a gluten-free meal for all 15+ hours of travel and did not apologize or make any effort to find me something from the reserves I had confirmed online and at both airports that I'd have something to eat and they confirmed both times. If I'd known I would have been irritated but at least I could have prepared! When I asked for water from the beverage cart they wouldn't give it to me because it came with the meal (which I never got) and when I finally got a crew member to stop she didn't answer me when I asked for water but came back 20 minutes later with some. The crew members were extremely hostile and rude. There was no entertainment whatsoever. The plane was a rickety old 3x3 seater which I would expect to take between states but not between continents.

Yesterday I flew PHL to LHR on the day flight departing at 9.35am EST. This very tired old plane needs to be retired pronto as not competitive at all. Sat in row 1 with bulk head in front with a seat used typically from internal US flights not a standard transatlantic seat although seat card indicated being refitted previously plane felt in a sorry state. As I am tall the bulkhead prevented me from stretching legs out at reasonable angle you would normally expect - straight was not possible. Outbound flight to PHL from LHR was with BA and was usual solid service but this was shocking by comparison and not worthy of the fare at all (had this been a night flight I would have walked back off the plane in disgust and gone with any other airline). I urge nobody to pay for Business on this route if with American from Philly until they put the modern seats in. Entertainment is provided by a Samsung ipad like device - which is good but means you put it away when food comes they aslo take them all back way before we landed so did not get to finish two movies on a 6hr flight. Tray table can not come out and sit flat unless I am sat up right - this is a nuisance. I did not like the food one bit. I was at my most happy when I got off the late plane (late leaving as someone left passport in checked luggage resulting in waiting behind 17 planes to take off at PHL) - had sat in useless seat for 8+ hours as we were late.

DUB-PHL-LAX-PHL-DUB. First experience with US and overall it was good. Good value for money pleasant and engaged cabin crew and the special meal pre ordered on the transatlantic legs of the trip was quite good by today's airline standards. A nice touch on the outbound trip was a mid flight ice cream snack and the complementary wine with meals was also appreciated. Good selection on the Transatlantic IFE but surprisingly no IFE on the U.S. Domestic A321s. Quite a limited inflight menu on domestic flights not much healthy food on offer and by the time cabin crew reached us they were sold out of most food items. Return flight from LAX to PHL was diverted to Richmond due to ATC restrictions in PHL thankfully the DUB flight was held so when we eventually got to PHL we were able to make the connection which departed 1 hour 20 mins late. In spite of this arrival in DUB was 45 mins behind schedule.

My wife and I decided to travel to Anguilla for our honeymoon and booked our flight through US Airways. Being that it was our honeymoon I decided to call US Airways and find out the cost associated with upgrading our seats. However upon my conversation with the attendant was promptly made aware that the actual flights we were on had changed and our plane was now scheduled to depart and arrive at completely different times. Not only did they replan my arrival and departure times for me but they took it upon themselves to change my seats and not even assign me to two on my return flight. I am not going to say my honeymoon was ruined however when a merge causes a company to become so big they begin rearranging your plans it begins to make sense why they shouldn't happen. On a side note if we switched the situation and decided to change our flight instead we would be paying a $200 change fee and the difference in ticket price each. Not once were we offered an upgrade for the inconvenience or a partial refund for the change of flights which appear to be less expensive. I was previously a supporter of US Air however after learning that they can take it upon themselves to rearrange my honeymoon plans you can bet I am flying another airline for business moving forward.

PHX-PHL-BRU (RT) - Truly decrepit old 757s for the PHL to BRU segments combined with downright terrible inflight service made this one of the worst inflight experiences in my recent memory. Anyone who is buying a business class ticket and 'chooses' US Airways needs their head examined. For those of you who focus on One World British Airways with a LHR connection is a much better choice. That's what I'll be doing from now on.

My husband and I were on a leisure trip from Atlanta to Phoenix. Our flight from Atlanta was delayed 3 hours due to "Mechanical Issues". Fortunately we flew direct and did not have a connecting flight but there were many on our flight who did. When we arrive in Phoenix there was a delay getting the cabin doors open so we could disembark. I don't know what that was all about. No explanation from crew. On our return flight from Phoenix to Atlanta again a 1.5 hour delay due to "Mechanical Issues". We will never fly US Airways again.

Returning from Cabo San Lucas our flight was delayed by almost an hour. Not usually a problem but we had to catch a connecting flight in Phoenix to Denver. After rushing through the airport we found that we had missed the connecting flight! Ok no worries we were scheduled on another flight to Denver 3 hours later. After waiting for almost 3 hours that flight was cancelled. No explanations just cancelled. The customer (dis)service person at the US Airways counter was rude arrogant and even threatened us with calling the police if we didn't leave the counter. We called his bluff and he put down the phone and printed us two boarding passes for yet another flight another 3 hours later. This flight was overbooked and we were not even guaranteed a seat. By this time I got on my iPad and booked a (surprisingly) cheap flight on another airline no fuss and we were on our way to Denver within the hour. It was just a nightmare day from start to finish but by some wild chance of a miracle we did find our luggage when we landed in Denver. Apparently the baggage handlers do know how to do their jobs. US Airways is unreliable and their people are unprofessional incompetent and downright rude. We will never fly this airline again!

Flight 747 Seattle - Charlotte - Orlando April 27th. Very disappointing trip. Mechanical problems delays lack of communication no entertainment (except the other passengers). Poor and expensive food choices. Uncomfortable cramped seats. Unprofessional flight attendants. In a country where air travel has become a national embarrassment this airline is certainly doing their best to reinforce that.

I traveled from Hartford Connecticut to Washington DC for a 3 hour meeting. I've been in the airport waiting for my return flight for more time than it took me to fly to DC and conduct my business. I endured a perpetual game of delay and cancellation. It was a horrible night after a long and arduous day that began at 4 am in the morning. I just boarded the plane and have to go to work tomorrow morning. The service could not be worse. I will never fly US Airways ever again to Washington DC from Hartford Connecticut. I would've been better off hiring the car service. It may be more expensive but it certainly would not have been more time-consuming and it would've been much more reliable.

Route from AUS to PHL to CHO returning on AA. Check-in with 2 checked bags went smoothly. I'm AAdvantage Plat. so speed security lines and early boarding. E-190 seats in economy are wide and pretty comfortable for a 3 hour flight. No inflight Entertainment but WIFI is available. New commuter terminal at PHL is pretty good also with a new Admirals Club and large food court. Express Dash 8 flight pretty standard almost on time but noisy and bumpy for the 1 hour flight to CHO. Returned on AA was cancelled with about 3 hours notice rebooked on US at 5am the next day. Went to Airport anyway and received a hotel voucher and spent another night. Early flight from CHO meant no airport shuttle so took acb. CRJ-200 to CLT PSA CRJ seats are pretty decent much better than Mesa not service what so ever even though almost 50 minutes in the air. Connected to a CRJ-900 for the 3 hour flight to AUS. Have taken this in the past with trepidation. CRJ's just aren't that comfortable with no inflight entertainment and no Wifi. 2 Beverage runs and we were almost on time. Us Airways Express really needs to pad their times some more. All express flight seem to take longer in the air than are scheduled gate to gate. Overall they did the job but still prefer AA.

Four flights from Phoenix to Philadelphia in April. Nice weather up and down the eastern coast. Flight from Phoenix to Charlotte taxied on the runway for 30 minutes and left 25 minutes late. Two of these flights had another crew on them flying home and they didn't have very nice things to say about their employer. Arrived in Charlotte as my next flight was just arriving "late". The passengers disembarked the flight cleaned and we boarded 30 minutes later and left the ground 20 minutes after that. Very little information about what was going on from the crew. Departing Philadelphia the flight boarded on-time but my original seat from what I reserved online was changed at check in and I was moved to the last seats and by a window and next to the engine. It was so loud I couldn't hear my music and had to fly with earplugs in my ears. After the captain figured out that he was on the wrong runway he told us and said there was going to be a delay of 15-20 minutes. When we finally landed at Dallas my flight was supposed to be boarding but after running to the gate the flight had been delayed due to weather and other flights. I had just come from the east coast and checked the weather and I didn't see anything that could have delayed a flight. I don't fly very much but this trip was ridiculous. No matter what the price is I wont ever fly American or US Airways.

Flew in from Pittsburgh to Charlotte on April 15. Flight was late getting in and by the time we got off of the plane and made it to our departure gate we had 14 minutes to spare. They shut the door in our faces when we tried to get on and no one would speak to us. We had two others traveling for corporate with us and they said that our seats were given away. We had to rent a car to get to Charlotte for our corporate meetings that night that cost us $300.00. Manager and customer service very rude. Never again.

Flew from Washington to Boston on Economy. Arrived at the airport at 5pm for check in for 6.30pm flight. After several gate changes following a series of confusing announcements in an extremely overcrowded terminal the creeping delays started half an hour at the time. After an hour we were informed plane had landed but due to congestion there were no stands available. Finally boarding was announced at around 8.30pm after which it started to rain. We were then informed there would be a further delay due to the rain. We sat on the plane for an hour then taxied to the runway and waited another hour only to be informed that the flight would now be cancelled due to the weather. It was now after 10pm. On disembarking I was fortunate to be near the front so could be attended to quickly at the customer services desk for re-booking but I later realized others were stuck in a queue for hours late into the night. I was told flatly that all flights were full and overbooked until 10pm the next day. I was told rudely to 'take the 10pm flight or leave it' and as it was due to the weather it was not their responsibility to offer anything else (in fact the weather was just one of the contributing factors for the cancellation - the plane had already been late). I had to push and push to be offered alternative options (e.g. flights to a different airport or with layover etc). Eventually they found a flight via Philadelphia the next morning. I asked for more details and then agreed to be put on the flight only to be told I had taken too long to make a decision and now that flight was also full! I overheard other passengers being rebooked for other morning flights in adjoining desks so I have no idea what was going on. After much persuasion a seat miraculously became available at 11am the next day. Bizarre. I understand that delays and cancellations are not the fault of the customer service desk but they should at least be courteous understanding and helpful to passengers at a stressful time - not dismissive.

Flew from PHL to Cancun straight through trip. We were offered one drink for the 3 hours and 45 minute trip. The seats were very cramped and I had a seat directly in front of a bathroom - lucky me with the smells and all coming from the very overused and unclean restroom. We hit "turbulence" and the pilot had the attendants in economy sit down. But I guess the attendant in first class was "safe" because she continued to serve those in first class. There were no TV's movies and the trip was long and hot at times. I would give them a no star rating. I will not fly US Airways again and from the looks of the other reviews I am not alone in this decision!

We booked for a flight to Seattle Washington last April 5 2015. After boarding crew told us that there will be a delay because the plane has some mechanical problems. We waited for almost 2 hours before they decided to deplane us. They told us to rebook our flight we got a flight thru Alaska Airlines at 3.40pm (originally our flight is 6.15am). We spent more or less an hour in the line for all passengers have to rebook their flight. They didn't give us anything for our inconvenience or for messing up our schedule.

### US Airways customer review
Portland to Philadelphia Feb 22 2015 flight #4437 then #799 to Orlando. Returned March 6th flight #1757 Orlando to Philadelphia then #4437 to Portland. A terrible experience. When booking flights it asks if you are travelling with children which I was yet not one of the three adults that were travelling were able to sit with the child. When we land in Philadelphia we go directly to the gate so that there will be no worries of us missing our flight. The time comes when we should be starting to load the plane and my husband goes and asks when will be boarding and they inform him the gate has changed which they had not announced. Us along with most of the people sitting around us run to the new gate. When we arrive they there is a delay because they have to bring in a new plane once the new plane arrives they have to clean it after an hour they tell us there are problems with the plane. We wait again and they announce the pilot has run out of time and they need to bring in another. Our 6 pm flight ends up leaving at 11.30 pm. When they do start to board the plane the lady starts yelling at everyone to hurry up like we were the reason for the plane being so late. The return flight comes around and I am thinking surely this time things will be better - wrong. We look at our tickets to see if by any chance we will have someone to sit with my son on any of the flights No. Then I notice that on one of the flights I do not have a seat number. I go to the counter and ask what does this mean and I am told I have to check at that airport when I arrive. I ask does this mean I will not be on the flights? Oh no you will be. I get to that airport and am told the flight is full I will have to wait for another flight. I said no I am travelling with three other people my husband child and elderly mother - I then wait for hours in another airport. In the end I did get on the plane. Will not fly US Airways again if I can help it.

I had a 4pm flight scheduled from Boston Phoenix last Thursday that never took off until 8 because they couldn't close the passenger door. We wasted money waiting around for our delayed flight and the only compensation we had was one free alcoholic drink on the way over. Then on our return flight they couldn't find my fathers information and would not let him on the flight. He had to pay an additional 500 dollars to board and now has to wait to be reimbursed. Mark my words I will never fly this airline again.

Reasonable experience on recent flight from Philiadelphia to Miami. OneWorld Emerald member so used the lounge which was actually quite good. Flights on time aircraft clean and crew attentive - inflight meal ok. Cannot believe that US airways does not have inflight entertainment come on it's prehistoric! My other slight annoyance was that when I enquired if I could catch an earlier flight (checked in very early) I was told that would be $75 - my flight was full but the earlier one was less full...just appears to be cheap especially as my luggage caught the earlier flight (and I thought airlines tried to avoid unaccompanied luggage! ).

Flight 503 March 29 2015. Traveling from FLL-PHX-Calgary. Flight attendants hid from view most of the trip(s) and tried to change seats online and was asked for a $78 fee. Nuts. Same seat area just a different and vacant position. Could not even sit with my spouse. Will never fly with this airline again.

I had 3 flights yesterday. 2 went down for mechanical issues causing the other to become over booked. I drive all the way back to Austin TX from San Antonio to catch the first flight and that's delayed. I told them to put me on the flight that's boarding now and I'm on a plane that's not moving cause of guess what mechanical issues! So much for me making my brothers wedding. Never again.

Never again. My wife and I bought seats together for our round trip from Baltimore to Phoenix. Our seats were not honored both ways. Staff were not helpful. On the return trip the gate attendant was eating a sandwich while helping customers. Every single US Airways flight at the terminal was oversold. If it wasn't for volunteers we would have had to wait 8 hours for the next flight home. The plane was dirty and dusty. They don't even provide any free snacks. You had to pay $4 for a tiny bag of peanuts. Bottom line is if you want to sit with strangers possibly not make your flight overpay for snacks and sit on a dirty plane this is the airline for you.

It seems that US Airways doesn't realize that "flight" is not the entire customer experience. The experience begins well before the flight and ends well after the flight. We flew to SFO from PHX this week. We were issued boarding passes and noticed we were in Zone 5. Well since the seats are reserved that didn't seem to be a problem until during boarding a gate agent came to my wife and told her that they were checking her bag "because there wasn't any bin space left" and we could go to the carousel at SFO to pick it up. My wife's bag is not large but it does have rollers and it seemed they were "confiscating" every bag in Zone 5 with rollers. We boarded the aircraft and discovered there was loads of bin space. I approached the First Class Cabin attendant and said I'd like to retrieve my wife's bag he said "no it's already gone. I asked why they were telling passengers there wasn't any bin space when there clearly was plenty of space. He offered a "well they don't actually check it's just that at about this time in boarding there isn't much space left. On arrival in SFO we thought well at least as the last bag loaded it'll be the first one off the carousel again we were mistaken. At least 50 bags came off before our bag and not a quick 50 bags. We discovered on our return flight (we returned from San Jose Airport) the same protocol was used by the gate attendant. Our bag was the last carry on allowed all the others were collected and checked. We realized at that point since there was plenty of bin space again that this is a "convenience" move by US Air their convenience they don't risk a late "push back" if people are seated faster. Of course "their convenience" translates into "our inconvenience. Why not board 5 minutes earlier? The plane was there all arriving passengers had been off for at least 30 minutes prior to our boarding. Moral of the story - my wife said "I don't care how much more it is to fly Southwest we're never flying US Airways again.

I am extremely dissatisfied in US Airways customer service. Our flight to CLT from BOS was delayed due to not having a flight crew and CLT was not allowing any flights to land so we were assured that our connecting flight to MBJ would be made. When we finally got to CLT the flight attendant informed us that the flights were "on time" meaning their original time as we were in the air heading to CLT so we were not able to make our connecting flight. He was not able to give us any information (which is ridiculous) and we were promised that there would be US Airways staff at the gate. Of course this was a lie we had to wait in a 3 hour line told there were no other flights to our all inclusive resort told to get a hotel that the airline did not pay for we were in line for standby only once we got to the airport at 6 am. The kiosk assistant tried to split the 3 female travelers up heading to a foreign country after we had each paid 870$ to fly together and then found there were 3 seats on the next flight which demonstrates her incompetence. Our luggage was not available to us.

Traveled from Omaha to Honolulu with 4 connecting flights total. We had a large family with 7 children. On each and every flight children were put in different rows from parents. We were able to switch with other passengers but with little help from staff. One of my daughters was traveling with an eight year old and a three year old. The children were placed in different rows and seats on a 7 hour flight and told there was "nothing they could do. Another daughter of mine had an infant and was twice placed in an exit row being told A) They cannot sit there B) You will have to find someone to switch with. (No fault of their own when they assigned the seats). My daughter was also told on our third flight that they could not gate check the baby's stroller. For what reason? No idea. We travel often and understand there are occasional mishaps. Unfortunately this pattern was consistent throughout our trip. We are hoping not to have to travel US or American again.

Took a flight with US Airways from JFK to Asheville with a change of plane in Charlotte. Our flight left JFK one hour late the Captain said he was waiting for paper work to be signed. We therefore missed our flight to Asheville the US Airways staff at Charlotte were very rude and could not care less. I had to beg to use a phone to call my cousin who was picking us up in Asheville to let her know what had happened. The agents at Charlotte said there were no seats left on any flights leaving for Asheville that day or the next I asked what should I do they said not our problem and shrugged their shoulders. I went to the desk and asked for a refund for the Charlotte to Asheville part of the trip and they cancelled my return flight as well.

We recently travelled via US Airways to St. Lucia Virgin Islands. Our return flight home was routed through Charlotte N.C. Here we were scheduled for a 3 hour layover plenty of time to get through Customs and Immigration and re-check our baggage for our final destination. However the plane was one hour late in boarding in St. Lucia. Upon our arrival in Charlotte we were told there was no gate open for parking at the airport so we waited on the tarmac for a half hour or so. Then we were told there was no ground crew further delaying our de-planing. Once at the gate we were told that Customs was backed up and we were made to wait for another half hour on the plane. At this point we had 1 hour left to get through Customs and Immigration re-check our baggage and run to our gate actually only 45 minutes as the plane cannot be boarded for the last 15 minutes before take- off. My husband had TSA pre-check on his ticket however I did not. I had to go through a very long security line. My husband went to the gate to notify our plane that I was on my way - hurrying. Just as I finally ran to the gate (just at the 15 minute before flight mark) the flight attendants closed the door to the gate and would not allow me to board. I begged as there was still 15 minutes until take off they would not budge. We went to the ticket counter and were told that it was the last flight out and that there were no flights available the next day. So with no way to get home we rented a car drove all night and arrived back home 8 hours later without our baggage. We were met with rudeness and a complete lack of sympathy from customer service when dealing with the airline. By the way our flight from St. Lucia was to have meals available for purchase however by the time the attendants reach our seat in the 19th row there was no food left. We had not eaten all day.

Seattle to Phoenix round trip. I was nervous about flying with US/American Airways after checking on this site there were so many poor reviews. When I got on the flights which weren't late or delayed by mechanical problems it was just like most other US domestic airlines I've flown on. The planes might have been a little old but they looked to be in about the same condition as a lot of other commercial carriers. Seats didn't seem to be any less comfortable leg room was average. Probably the biggest downside was that there was no inflight entertainment but they were only 2.5 hour flights so reading a book or playing a game was fine. The crews were nice not overly friendly and the pilots gave a few updates during the flight (both ways) which I always appreciate. I did notice that they didn't mention which baggage claim to go to at the end of either flight which would not be convenient for people that don't just do carry-ons. I'd say overall it's pretty comparable to most other airlines.

### US Airways customer review
US Air has become a disaster zone. First they switched our aircraft and seat assignments without any notification giving us poorer locations. Then no online check-in was available in either direction resulting in chaos at the terminals. The self-service kiosks for one airline wouldn't accommodate the other. (American doesn't recognize US Air confirmation codes and vice versa). Our outbound flight was delayed by an hour to load late cargo. (Why should cargo be given priority? The plane wouldn't have waited if we'd been stuck in a traffic jam or overslept). Onboard the premium economy seats were hardly bigger than standard seats. The earphones at $5 were defective and the jacks in the seats had poor connections. Food options were a joke and the new credit card system does not provide a receipt. Customers were told to go online if they wanted one. Really? All the same check-in problems occurred on the return flight. Then we had to move to a different gate because the plane was (guess what?) delayed. Cargo perhaps. No restrooms on the same level as this new gate and no other services. Then all the same problems with inflight food and entertainment. On landing the crew forgot to ask passengers to fasten seat belts put tray tables/seats in their full and upright position etc. No one came through the aisles checking. And at no time during the flight did the captain or "flight deck" welcome passengers or comment on anything. We suspect this is all the result of unhappy people working in an unhappy environment. Stay away if you can. We have vowed never to fly American/US Air again.

My experience was horrible. My flight coming home to PHL was canceled due to not enough crew members (as the email says). So then they tell me to do stand by for a few flights in Denver which I do. I was at the airport at 7am on a Sunday. All of the stand by fell through so they booked me a flight for 4.05pm to Charlotte n/c and then on to another plane to go to MDT Harrisburg. Everyone boards the plane at 4.20 and we just sit there didn't even move away from the door. Pilot comes over the loud speaker and says they are waiting for paperwork and that their computer system is down. The flight finally left at 6.35pm and arrived in Charlotte at 11.15. The flight ran out of food and only had chips left and when landed everything was closed in the airport so no dinner for me! Missed the connecting flight by almost an hour. So finally at 2am Monday morning I have a flight booked for 9.55am to go to a different airport because they couldn't get me to the other one until Tuesday! I wanted to change airlines but they said I could not get my checked bag back from them which was checked in Denver and at that time I made sure to get my bag switched to the new flight and they gave me a paper saying it was. They ran out of hotel rooms to give out and they said I can either pay for it myself of sleep at the airport. So I stayed at the airport. When I finally landed in Newark NJ my snowboard was not there and is at a different airport which I now have to wait to be shipped to me. If you want to not make any of your flights and waste a bunch of your time and money then I suggest using US Airways. I am now home at 3pm Monday when I was supposed to be home Sunday at 12pm.

I was very much surprised and disappointed on my recent flight from Paris France to Philadelphia. I have never seen stewardesses act the way they did on this flight. I am an American yet most of the passengers were European. First off there was a language barrier. Some of the French passengers were sitting in the wrong seats. The stewardesses were telling the passenger to move. When they seemed confused these airline employees started to become very rude telling the passengers that because of them the flight was going to be late. I have never witnessed such disrespect on the employees part I decided to just remain in my seat and do as told not wanting to experience their wrath. No such luck My husband and I were dozing when they passed out ice cream. I couldn't find a spoon with the container. Not wanting to "bother" the stewardess I started to eat the ice cream using the lid as a spoon. The stewardess passed by and took the ice cream from my hands and took out the plastic spoon that was contained in the lid. I jokingly said "sorry I couldn't find it". Her abrupt response was "you should have-they made an announcement where to find the spoon five minutes ago" I could not believe my ears. I didn't even bother to tell her that I did not hear the announcement due to the fact that I was sleeping. I have traveled with many airlines and have never witnessed this behavior before.

Avoid at all costs. Monday my flight was canceled and given notice only minutes before I was going to leave. They then booked me on a flight the next day the last flight out of Cancun for the day. We had to purchase another night at our hotel at my own expense. Then I decided to go online and I found an earlier flight so I called the airlines and they put me on the earliest flight out of Cancun. My plane was second to take off on the tarmac when the pilot announced that a warning light was going on and that he needed it to be fixed. He proceeded to pull the airplane off of the active runway to get a hold of maintenance 20 minutes later announced that we had to return to the gate. But another plane was already at our gate so he pulled as close to the gate as possible so a bus was brought to the plane we got off on a bus and went back to the gate. Two hours later we got back on the bus and back on the plane. So now my flight was four hours late and of course I missed my connection in Philadelphia. When we got off the plane in Philadelphia they were very nice and they already booked my connection on a later flight to Milwaukee. Flight was supposed to leave at 8.30 but of course it did not leave at 8.30 because they did not have a crew for that particular flight. We finally took off at 11.10pm that night. No apologies from anyone all the crew said was we've had a long day too we were delayed for three hours so all of us are tired. Not what I really want to hear when I'm getting onto a flight. I have traveled all around the world on numerous flights and occasionally I have encountered weather delays or minor maintenance problems so I'm used to that but never ever have I experienced three flights all with issues unbelievable. I will never fly them again.

US Airways flying out of Charlotte NC to Greensboro seems incapable of being on time and/or not overbooking. For the second time I missed my connecting flight in CLT to GSO because US Airways was delayed by two hours from my origin in Orlando. No explanation given but I am 100% sure weather had nothing to do with it as all was clear in Charlotte and Greensboro. The remaining three flights that evening were all overbooked. This is what happened before and I ended up waiting around trying to get on a flight all night only to be shuttled to a hotel to spend the night and hopefully get a flight the next morning. I wasn't going to do that again as GSO is only a 1.5 hour drive so I rented a car and drove home. Were they willing to reimburse my rental? Of course not instead they offered a voucher. Terrible customer relations.

Feb 17 flight 646 from PDX to PHX. On the same day I took flight 489 from PHX to PIT. I decided to fly US Airways PDX to PIT in February as the connection was in PHX and I was pretty sure PHX wouldn't have weather-related delays. I regretted buying my ticket after I started reading reviews about US Airways. And I was expecting the worst when I flew a couple of days ago. To my surprise it was actually really good. Both flights were early both planes had clearly been updated and were clean and comfortable. The flight attendants were attentive friendly and helpful. On the first flight which left PDX at 5.20 am the FA was careful to not wake people up while also serving those who were awake. When people woke up later and asked for things the FA served them breakfast and drinks with a smile. Breakfast was great - steel cut oats with fresh fruit dried fruit nuts (I don't like eating a huge eggy breakfast early (which was also offered) in the morning and appreciated this healthy choice). The two things that were disappointing about the trip was t he lack of space in first class on the 319 and the lack of entertainment system on a longer flight (4 hours). With regard to the seat when the person in front of me reclined I couldn't use my table and the seat was less than a foot from my face. I had to ask the passenger to move her seat which she was gracious about. But I thought that it was less space in first class than I get on some airlines in coach.

Flew US Airways as part of a round trip First Class Flight specifically targeted to try BA's A380 out of IAD and be on one of the last 767-200 flights before they retired the fleet. First impression at OMG in the morning in Orlando I went to the First Class check-in for my International flight. Instead of being helped I was told to use a machine which frankly was confusing and when I asked for help I got an agent rolling her eyes and loudly expelling air. Really? Off to the gate and onto a 757 in the Intl config. Seat was decent crew was experienced and the gentleman working first knew his craft well. Came to take drink orders for me and the person next to me set the "snack basket" between us. Changed to a PSA operated CRJ900. Brand new with the new plane smell. Nice for what it is and in the inflight service was ok. Return from IAD to CLT in a CRJ900 operated by Mesa. The plane was a train wreck and smelled like urine. The FA's served F class to death but no one in coach even got a glance. US Air lounge in CLT lots of dark wood and Fox Noise on the TV's. Last leg to MCO on one of the last 767-200's. Flight late to gate then an hour delay. FA's very senior polite and knew how to do the job. US Airways can be good or horrible you never know what to expect.

I was stranded overnight in Phoenix on superbowl weekend. I am supposed to be a preferred customer. My flight was cancelled "due to weather" which means all the passengers must sleep in the airport as all hotel rooms are booked in Phoenix for the superbowl. They passed out pieces of paper offering "discounts of about 20%" on hotel rooms that were not available. I received a standby ticket for the next day and there is no guarantee I will get on as the superbowl passengers are leaving tomorrow as well. Poor planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on my part. No voucher were issued since they claimed they could not control the weather. There are absolutely no hotel rooms here and absolutely no flights out of here at all for apparently several days. US Air is an avoid at all costs.

Every time that I fly US Airways there is a maintenance issue. In Philly we were on the plane for three hours while tech support troubleshot the navigation system. The last time we boarded the plane when it was time to push back from the gate there's a maintenance issue. The markers that align to show the cabin door has been properly closed were not aligning. We were asked to return to the terminal and wait for the off site maintenance to come check it out. Forty minutes later we were allowed to board again and were able to successfully take off. We arrived to Charlotte at 9.35 which gave me five minutes to make it to my connecting flight on the opposite side of the airport. Never Again!

### US Airways customer review
I have traveled with US Airways many times as I live in Asheville NC and the closest major airports are CLT and ATL. Therefore whenever I travel I almost only fly Delta or US Airways. Most recently I flew from CLT to CUN. Although the 757-200 had winglets and the fancy new AA paint job that could not make up for the dissatisfaction I experienced during flight. My seat was very uncomfortable and the cabin was very very dated. There was NO in flight entertainment (not even from the clunky overhead screen). The staff were decent but nothing spectacular. On the way back I flew on an A321 but it felt similar to the 757 I had flown on to CUN. I have flown on every type of plane in the fleet and every plane has this sort of feeling with the exception of the A330 (note: the A330 fleet still feels average when compared to other airlines but is better than every other plane in their fleet. The 767-200s in their fleet are horrible and the A320 family in their fleet is relatively shabby. Regional jets are what you would expect from a regional jet. Overall a horrible airline and as soon as I move out of Asheville to a larger city I plan on using another airline.

Flew to Manchester UK. First leg (delayed). Second leg (PHI to MAN UK) we all get on the plane after slight delay and the pilot comes on and says "We have to replace to doors on the front undercarriage - we'll be here about 15 minutes". For the next hour we hear every 15 minutes that we will be on the ground for another 15 minutes. Finally we head for the de-icing stand. The pilot tells us that the plane had been standing at the airport all day and it would take extra time to de-ice. If the plane had been there all day why hadn't they taken care of the maintenance and got the plan de-iced before the scheduled departure time? Rest of flight is routine until we get to Manchester when they can't seem to get the jetway to roll up to the door. Come on people how hard can it be? So we have to wait for them to find some steps and we deplane onto the tarmac. Glad it wasn't bucketing with rain. On way back they book us onto a cancelled flight and don't tell us our connection is cancelled until we get to Philadelphia. What's more they think everything is cancelled for Tuesday too and they don't care! Customer service reps weren't even apologetic and certainly weren't interested in helping us get home. So we run over to the departures board and find jetBlue still has flights and we manage to get on a jetBlue flight. Re: Food. They served dinner at 11 O'clock at night - really? All you want them to do at that time is turn the lights down so you can try to sleep. Didn't eat it but it left the cabin smelling like a Russian cafeteria Then they served a pathetic breakfast just before landing when a decent breakfast would have been welcome. Totally ill-conceived. Re: Cabin crew: Perfectly acceptable. Did have an odd situation where the crew member asked me what I wanted to drink and then disappeared without a word (or a drink) and I had to ask again when they went by later but they brought me my drink quickly after that. It was the service desk that causes me to rate Staff Service as poor. Re: Entertainment. Overseas flight had seat back screens but the range of selections was very weak and the screens themselves were very bulky - they were touch insensitive screens.

Because I travel professionally from PHL I am stuck with US Airways as they have a monopoly on most domestic non- stops from here. This week alone on three separate flights customer service: 1) Refused to seat me with my wife on the same reservation as I was placed in a choice seat (ADA accommodation) and she would've had to pay $89 each way for the upgrade (one row up) or sit separately. Yes this was after I informed then it was due to an old line-of-duty injury they didn't care. 2) Refused to waive a $450 difference for a flight two hours before the flight I was booked on even though the requested change is because of an impending snow storm starting when the flight I'm booked on is leaving. 3) Charged bag fees to Cancun Mexico even though it is an international flight and they don't charge fees for every other Mexican city they fly to.

We flew from Brussels to Philadelphia. Before we even took off the pilot announced we might have to stop to refuel which would delay our flight by an hour. That being said the plane was miserably small and old. The air conditioners were so loud it was difficult to hear announcements or talk to flight attendants. We had to stop in NY for fuel which delayed our flight by an hour and a half. We landed in Philadelphia at 3.10. At least 20 passengers missed their connecting flights in Philadelphia including ourselves. We were supposed to have a connecting flight to Nashville at 3.45. When we deplaned they already had new tickets printed for passengers who would be missing their next flight which was nice. The new plan was to leave for Charlotte at 5 and then catch a connecting flight to Nashville. It took them an hour to retrieve our luggage from the plane and another 20 minutes for us to get through customs and security. We rechecked out bags but they didn't ask us for any additional information just took our bags and said we were fine. The gate number for Charlotte on the ticket they had just printed was wrong so we almost missed that flight but made it just in time. We got to Charlotte and boarded for Nashville without any glitches. When we boarded for Nashville we sat in the plane for 30 minutes after our take off time. No one said why. We finally got to Nashville and our luggage had not made it with us. They said it was still in Charlotte. They are supposed to be delivering it some time today. We'll see.

Just completed a business class flight from PHL to Rome. Flight was less than average at best. I have taken many business class flights on other airlines so I have a sense of what should happen. When arriving the attendant did not greet us. She just threw the menu our way and said to give her our dinner order. They served me my on board champagne but forgot to serve my partner. When we inquired the attendant said to wait a minute as he was doing a 'head count'. Partner ordered the steak but was given the fish instead. They apologized and said to wait 20 minutes for the steak. When it finally arrived it was blood red and inedible. If you ask me they do not have enough help on board. With 32 seats in business I saw only 2 attendants. Etihad and Thai Airways have double that for the same number of people. The new business class seats are made for men. It is not possible to put your foot on the foot rest without adjusting the seat back. This airline needs to step it up. Suggest avoiding if at all possible and certainly do not pay the premium cost for business class.

Flew SJU-PHL first class. Had to make BA connection in PHL but had best part of 2 hours. Plane was late in and when we were all loaded we waited around for no obvious reason. It transpired that one of the maintenance crew had gone off with the plane's log without which it couldn't fly. Plane (757) itself had been repainted in the new AA livery but inside was very old and tired. First class seat quite comfortable but the cabin was dreary - as was the service. Grumpy and unhelpful flight attendants. Unable to give me any help about my connection in PHL and I was told to ask when I got there. Landed just before 6pm. As they didn't use the front door it took a while to get out. Then they announced that the agent was only providing information to passengers with connections before or at 6pm - basically people who had missed their flights and not those (like me) who had an outside chance of making it (if I could find the plane). I asked another agent whose terse reply was "If it's a BA flight I don't know". Great Thanks. Well worth letting US Airways into One World wasn't it? Found it and made the flight to LHR. BA infinitely better. US Airways is like the sort of airline you'd expect to find in a Third World country.

### US Airways customer review
I'm a former law enforcement officer with a knee injury. Unfortunately as I live in Philadelphia I fly US Airways as they have a near monopoly on long non-stops out of PHL. I fly every month and am always accommodated through the ADA into the bulkhead seat for the extra legroom as I'm 6'3". On the rare occasions that my afraid- of-flying wife is accompanying me she has (since 2009) been accommodated with me in the next seat as a courtesy. Last week I booked two trips one for a conference and one vacation that my wife is accompanying me on. On my customary call to US Airways to get my ADA accommodation (because there's no way to do this online when you book the seats) I was told that my wife would have to sit separate from me or I'd have to pay for the "choice seat". When I explained to the customer service agents they all stated that there is nothing they can do for me as all they had to do under the law was accommodate me and my wife had to pay the fee. I fly at least 12-20 times a year with US Airways and they'd rather offend me by making my wife pay a fee to sit in the disabled row next to me for a lousy $52 each way? The mere principal here is rude. The shame is that I'm stuck with stops if I switch carriers but am considering doing so immediately. Southwest is looking better to me every day and the minute JetBlue comes to PHL I'm taking all my business there.

December 27 BOS to MJB and return on January 3 non-stop flights which operate only on Saturdays to Jamaica and back. After the mixed reviews for this airline I accompanied by nine other family members was not looking forward to this flight. Almost a two-hour delay taking off caused by understaffed flight control employees on vacation and a one hour delay landing because of bad weather in Boston tested our grandkids' endurance. But US Airways made the experience on both legs as pleasant as possible. The captain kept us very well-informed and the flight attendants were cheerful and very present. The seats were more comfortable than in many economy cabins I have experienced. Further given the large number of families with young children boarding US Airways was able to start the board process early. Agents at both the check in counter and the gate were exceptionally helpful and friendly. And finally luggage arrived promptly at both destinations. An excellent experience.

I was recently reminded why I avoid US Air after a flight to LGA on Christmas Eve. The flights attendants offered no cabin service because of "Turbulence. My desk is more turbulent than that flight. They just refused to work. Maybe if they'd remained strapped in. It wasn't so turbulent that they couldn't walk around in the galley area. At least I booked on Delta for the return.

### US Airways customer review
I have flown with US airways 3 times now and each time has been unpleasant. I wonder if this airline is ever on time. All flights were delayed - once for 12 hours. This time I flew to Puerto Vallarta from San Francisco. The flight to SF was delayed and I had to run with my carry on and barely made my connecting flight. On the way back the check-in service at Puerto Vallarta airport was appalling. I first was directed to a long line to get my boarding pass from a computer and then I had to wait in another line for the US airways staff to look at my visa. Had to board a bus to get to the waiting plane. I booked my ticket / seats well in advance and was not given the seats I had selected - I was seated in the middle over the wing on all flights - the one seat I did not want. When I complained I was told it was my fault for checking in late - I was early and had chosen my seat when I purchased the tickets. I was also told that I did not have the right status to guarantee my seat. On the flight from Phoenix to San Francisco also delayed it was difficult to even get a cup of water. All together a horrible experience. I will be paying the extra dollars for the non-stop service with Alaska Airlines next time.

### US Airways customer review
I just returned from a family trip to Puerto Vallarta where we all flew US Air! This is the worst airline experience I have experienced. The employees seem to all be rude and unprofessional. It's a real shame since it flies to many destinations I fly to but I will pay more to have an airline that actually values its customers. Every leg of each of our flights were delayed one of our parties missed their flight even though the plane was still at the gate. It set on at the gate for 10 minutes before it pushed away. There were 21 people that needed to be rebooked standing! Same thing happened on the way back! Southwest and Alaska never treats passengers with such disregard.

Recently flew from Philadelphia to Orlando and return. Philadelphia curbside checking smooth - no issues. Pre- printed boarding so just straight to security. Airside boarding was crowded and pretty disorganized. Flight uneventful but crowded. Lots of families with excited kids but to be expected. Arrival fine. Return less crowded. No issues. Plane both ways pretty worn. FA's did job just not very friendly.

### US Airways customer review
I have always selected US Airways as my airline of choice. That will no longer be the case as of this last trip. I am completely unsatisfied with the way in which US Airways customer service dealt with a series of unfortunate events. I purchased 2 direct First Class flights from Washington DC to Phoenix AZ. Not only was the first flight cancelled due to maintenance we were then re-routed through Des Moines Iowa only to have our second connecting flight to Phoenix cancelled. Over twenty hours later we finally reached our destination. We lost a day of our vacation. I phoned US Airways customer care and thought that they would understand the following - 1) We purchased Direct First Class seats which are more expensive then multiple stop shuttle flights as well as foregoing the lunch even that should have been offered. 2) Cancellations were not due to weather rather maintenance (on two planes)- we lost a day of an already short trip to see family. I requested a change in the RT flights home by 1 day (same flight # etc) to allow our family to make up the time lost. I was told and I quote "We got you there and that is all we commit to. Given you are requesting a flight change of your choice and not due to the airline there is nothing we can do for you. The total cost to make the change is $600.00 per person. I was disgusted at the lack of care regarding the situation and further their lack of concern. I would not recommend travelling on this airline.

We travelled for the first time with this airline and happy to say we were well pleased with all 4 of our flights. We left Manchester 8th Dec via Philadelphia and on to Miami landing 30 mins early. We experienced no hitches whatsoever and also with our return journey on Dec 18th. Seats were fine and food was very acceptable. No problems and we would be happy to use this airline again.

### US Airways customer review
I am disabled and have a great deal of difficulty walking unassisted - cannot bend my knees very far. I flew US Air not realizing how terrible they are. They waited until everyone was boarded before wheeling me to the plane. Since I have difficulty walking all eyes were on me as I very slowly walked to my seat holding onto the headrests of each seat. I had to make one connection with each flight in Charlotte NC. The reservation associate was able to place me on an aisle all but one way and told me when I got to Charlotte that staff at the gate would change me with another passenger. After everyone else had boarded a very rude gate attendant told me the plane was fully booked and they couldn't change my seat which was half way back in the middle seat. A sweet young lady on the aisle offered to change with me so at least I was able to accomplish that. I cannot carry any weight other than a handbag I asked the male flight attendant to carry my carryon to my seat and place it in the overhead for me he begrudging did it turned around in a huff and walked away afterwards. Staff were all rude. I will never fly this airline again. No food was offered on a flight that was almost 2 hours long. I also experienced a delay almost missing my connecting flight.

US799 AMS to PHL. Take this flight often unfortunately due to no other direct flights between these 2 locations. Firstly ground staff at PHL check in are just unfriendly. Surly and not one smile. The aircraft's they use on this leg often breaks down and the interior is extremely outdated. You get to watch a movie on an overhead screen zero selection. It's like flying on something from 20 years ago. What could make up for this is the cabin crew but unfortunately they too are surly and clearly lost all sense of customer service after many years on the job.

Flight 730 CLT-LHR economy. Boarded surprisingly early. Not full flight. Almost 1 hr delay at the gate after boarding due to mechanical issue but strong tail winds made up for most of it. Water was offered during the delay. Dinner was choice of chicken with risotto or pasta with Alfredo sauce plus soft cheese and crackers roll and butter garden salad and dressing and a dessert bar. The entrée is just the same as a microwave meal so if you like that you will like the food onboard. If you don't you won't. I did. Was pleasantly surprised by two changes since my last trip on this flight less than a month earlier - beer is now complimentary in economy. Previously only the house red / white wine was complimentary. Also the pre-arrival snack is more extensive. Before it was a hot muffin. Now it's the same hot muffin with a couple other bagged treats. CLT is nice for frequent flyers. Security Checkpoint C is kept for the elite levels so not much wait there. Also the preferred access lets you bypass the line of people waiting to board and go right to the front and be the next one on the plane.

CDG–PHL NOV 30 2014. CDG AA Lounge is over crowded. Only 3 men's lavatories for more than 100 people. Preflight drink in plastic glass. Pre-lunch drink with cold poor quality nuts appetizer salad similar to those available in a low-cost market. Entree and cheese were OK. Crew too busy to speak in the galley. No question for more bread wine or coffee. Seat is flat and ok so is IFE. Snack before lunch was a joke - a cheap pizza and a salad. Lavatories beetwen Business and Economy locked all the flight. No reason as to why!

I flew from Fort Lauderdale to Philadelphia and on to Ottawa on 24 Nov. I cannot say that this was a good travel experience. My first impression on arrival at the Fort Lauderdale check-in in counter was a dismal fail. Even though there were hardly any people in line I was ignored standing first in the wrong line then once directed to another line was ignored by the agent there until finally another approached and proceeded to get my baggage tag. The flights themselves were fairly uneventful and the inflight staff were much more friendly. The seating was however not comfortable nor was there any kind of seatback entertainment system like on other airlines. The flight from Philadelphia to Ottawa was a quick regional jet flight and therefore I am used to no on board amenities. This flight was not horrible but the poor reception at Fort Lauderdale did leave me feeling like I might not choose US Airways for my next transborder flight.

I was using a duffle sized soft bag as my carry on and the US Airways check-in assistant told me it was too big and I had to check it. I told her I had flown the previous day with US Airways and many other times using this same bag and it had never been a problem. Extremely dismissive - looked at my ticket and told me that I wasn't a preferred member. We put the bag on the frame and it fit. Told that it didn't matter and I had to check the bag. I checked the measurements of the bag online and it is compliant with airline requirements for carry on luggage. I am furious that status with an airline and one person's opinion impacts my service. I will be giving my business and money to other airlines.

YYZ-PHL-PUJ. Toronto has a horrible border preclearance. Whole passage (customs passport control baggage and security) took about 35-45 mins. The terminal on the other hand is clean and well maintained. The US Airways staff offered to put large carry-ons in the hold for free. The flight was uneventful staff indifferent. Connection in PHL well done. Terminal A looks amazing. Terminals B-E were very small and crowded. The flight from PHL to PUJ I was amazed that US Airways decided to use a twin-aisle A330. The crew was funny cheerful and helpful. The seats were reasonably clean and well spaced seatback IFE with quite the selection of games and videos/songs. The customs in PUJ were straightforward with a new 10 dollar entry tax for "tourist cards". Overall worth the money and definitely would fly again.

I recently flew with American Airlines from Philadelphia to Dublin on the red eye. The flight was well organised but the facilities were extremely poor. The inflight entertainment consisted of 1 screen for the cabin I was at the bulkhead so couldn't even see the film. Only one film was played for the entire 6 hours of the flight. The food was comical and breakfast I actually took with me to show my friends in the pub it consisted of a flat muffin which looked like a normal muffin had been stepped on.

Three hour flight delay due to mechanical issues. One being lack of AC. Confined to the airplane the entire time. One issue after another kept us grounded. Offered nothing but water. We sat at the gate the entire time looking inside the terminal at 2 fast food restaurants. We should have been allowed to deplane with instructions to stay in the immediate area. Once in the air we had to pay for food (snacks).

I was rebooked on US Airways after a United flight was delayed. Then the US Airways flight was delayed and we had to disembark. I had to rebook my trip because my onward US flight to Tel Aviv would have left. The customer service agent said I did not pay for the ticket and wondered several times why I was allowed to board. She called her supervisor who discovered I had paid (business class) and that is why I was on their flight. I received no apology but lots of attitude. So no more US Airways.

On November 5 2014 I flew US Airways - what a mistake. I am disabled and my husband checked the night before to make sure a wheelchair would be ready at the airport. Seattle to Tucson via Phoenix. No wheelchair in Seattle finally after waiting at check-in for 45 minutes the desk clerk was worried I was going to miss the flight and grabbed a wheel chair and I was put on plane at the last minute. Arrived at Phoenix - no wheelchair - person working at desk ignored me. Another passenger interrupted her and told her I needed assistance and I finally got help. Arrived in Tucson - no wheelchair - had to walk from tarmac to baggage. Wheelchair available for another customer - asked the person if he could get one for me he shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Customer service a nightmare - do not want to talk to you in person. The prices are good but they do not care about there customers.

PHX-HNL return in economy. Exit row seat so extra legroom. Be warned-any window seat directly behind the exit door has very limited legroom due to the protruding door. Seat 9d is excellent though-able to stretch out. Service friendly and good. Both flights on time even early by a few minutes. Only complaint would be seatmate on the overnight return. Very large man made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. When he sat down and slid back the arm rest rose with his body. Not fun. Entertainment shown on outbound but did not watch.

LGA-DCA-SYR. Flight out of LGA was delayed due to weather and had a very tight connection in DCA but the flight attendants kept reassuring me that I had enough time to make it. Flight to DCA on an E190 and it barely half full which provided a very comfortable flight and legroom and recline were good. No beverage runs this time due to heavy turbulence. Made it to my flight to SYR with a minute to spare this flight on a smaller E170. The flight attendant serving my row was an absolute delight. Per usual like all other major US carriers they lack the polish and finesse of their Asian counterparts. However she was very friendly warm and she made a lot of interaction with me and other passengers. I was given a whole can of Coke which is always nice flight was seamless and arrived on time. I'm also glad that the crew and the airline has a lot of positivity about its ongoing merger with American.

Our weekend was ruined when this airline canceled our flight due to mechanical problems. After sitting in the airport from 7:00am until 3:30pm our 8:30am flight was finally canceled. We repeatedly stood in line to find out what was going only to be told our best bet was to wait for that plane to be repaired. A part was coming at 11:00am and then it was coming at 2:00pm. By the time they received the part and found out it didn't correct the problem it was too late and there were no more flights that day. We were kept in the dark all day unless we went to find out what was going on. When the flight was officially canceled no one even announced it. Wouldn't announcing the cancelation be the least they could do for the customers who spent the entire day waiting. Shame on you US Airways for treating your customers so poorly and barely even offering an apology.

Flew from Dublin to Philadelphia (connecting flight to Boston delayed by 3 hours). On board staff never came to aid when call bell rung. On route back from Boston to Philadelphia delayed on the runway for 1.5 hrs due to snow crew told us not to worry if we missed our connecting flight to Dublin and that we could head straight for a flight to London. After running with bags for 20 mins through the airport we were told we could not get on the flight to London and would have to stay the night in Philadelphia. Staff were so rude it was unreal and especially to an elderly couple who missed their flight as a buggy was not allowed to transport them to their gate. Staff did not make us aware that they provided discounts for hotels either.

Having flown Boston to Honolulu via Phoenix first class with no problem I wasn't anticipating problems on the return journey. I could not have been more wrong. When I got to Phoenix on the return trip I was suddenly bumped to coach! They told me this was due to a change of aircraft and that the crew would treat me as if I was first class passenger. The crew told me there was no change of plane and that I had been bumped in favour of another passenger despite me holding a full first class ticket! I was treated exactly the same as a coach passenger so felt let down disappointed and lied to! I will never fly with US Airways again.

Second time I have used US airways and both times have been a disaster. First time from Tucson to Sacramento was delayed in Tucson (no explanation) then when I did get on and had to transfer planes in Phoenix I waited 3 hrs with a boarding pass in front of the gate. When I presented my boarding pass at the gate to get on they told me that the seat was already taken. Spent the night in Phoenix at a hotel because no flights were available. Swore I wouldn't fly them again but I had to get to Columbus Ohio for a wedding - got on the plane on time then sat there when they announced (at least they told us this time) that there were mechanical difficulties. Everyone got off got in a line of at least 100 fellow travelers to rebook it and the best they could do was another flight 10.5h later to arrive the next day (wedding would have already happened). Got my money back at least.

Flew from Heathrow to Charlotte on 04/10/14. Flight late leaving Heathrow and not enough layover time allowed so we missed our connecting flight to Orlando managed to get another flight early Sunday am (we were booked on a cruise that sailed Sunday afternoon) but spent a very uncomfortable night in Charlotte airport the US Airways staff offered no accommodation food or drink. On our return leg from Charlotte to Heathrow we were delayed over an hour and a half on the plane due to a "medical issue" with 2 passengers (This issue should have been picked up long before the passengers were allowed to board). Would I fly with US Airways again? Well just to say Ryanair could teach them something!

Direct flight from Charlotte to Salt Lake City. At the designated boarding time flight attendants told a few folks the plane was still in maintenance and we'd board in 15 minutes or so. (no announcement). 15 minutes later they said it would be another 15 minutes. Some time passed and they said they couldn't fix the plane in time so they were going to give us another one. Then they said we were waiting for a storm to pass before they brought the plane from the hanger. They finally got a plane over to the terminal then started trying to find the flight crew who had apparently left the airport. Crew later said they were told the flight was cancelled (although they never told the passengers that). They found the crew boarded zone 1 and 2 then realized the captain was missing so they asked everyone to deboard the plane. A Captain was eventually found. Plane took off 3.5 hours after scheduled time. We wouldn't have known anything that was happening if we hadn't been sitting near the gate desk. Communication was terrible to the passengers. We were basically kept waiting at the gate for 4 hours or so with the belief we would be boarding at any time. On the flip side the flight attendants were friendly pleasant and apologetic.

Flew from Las Vegas to Philadelphia and on to Portland. Never have I witnessed such complete incompetence and total disregard for the paying customer. Had to stay the night in the airport as flights were cancelled repeatedly with no explanation. Repeatedly shuttled from one terminal to another while the monitors were either not updated or working at all. We were told to go to customer service. Line was 150 yards long as I paced it. After an hour the same couple was at the counter. Two girls behind the counter. Finally took to the phone for help. At midnight we were told we weren't entitled to food or lodging vouchers as the cancellation's were due to traffic congestion. The only good thing I see is U.S Airways can only go up from here. Worst experience ever.

US Airways has an unfair baggage policy. In the interest of efficiency & courtesy I checked by bag only to hear an announcement at the gate that the flight was full and bags would be checked for free! US Airways knew the flight was full at the time I checked my bag and should have told me instead they charged me $50 (round trip).

Flight US 706 from Charlotte to Frankfurt was delayed for more than five hours due to maintenance. It seemed to be the second time within 6 days. Former records read to it accordingly. Delay came in steps of half hours and hours. Nobody cared whether passengers had to drink or to eat the shops in Charlotte were closed. Our flight US1917 five days earlier from Philadelphia was delayed for two hours. The plane had to return to the gate due to maintenance. The airline always prevented online booking with free luggage although it was already booked. US airlines are not committed to pay penalty. Maybe this is reasonable for the many delays of transatlantic flights. I review this airline as unreliable.

I was returning home from DFW on flight 649 on 9/27/2014 which was supposed to arrive in Phoenix with a connecting flight from Phoenix to San Jose. Instead of landing we circled Phoenix airport for over an hour then were diverted to New Mexico. After sitting on the tarmac for over 4 hours at Albuquerque airport we were told that the flight had to be canceled. Upon exiting the plane we were told to contact customer service (800 number). We were told that no reimbursements for hotels would be made and that there were no flights available that we could get on until the following Monday. I was told to ask about flight 9011 the next day which flew to Phoenix. The agent said she could put me on that flight but any flights continuing to San Jose the same day were not available. Later that evening I found a flight out of Phoenix to San Jose on Priceline for $337.00 and booked it so I could get home. Guess which airline that was on? US Airways! US Airways had one agent at the ticketing counter the following morning and over 187 people in line. Two days later I pulled up my unused ticket to request a refund and it shows a connecting ticket which I was not told about nor did I use and I am outraged! This was our second trip on US Airways - thinking it couldn't happen twice the first time we were diverted and had to drive 2 states to make a cruise! Again - no reimbursements!

CLT-BOS. It's advertised online as 2+ hours but the flight only took 95 minutes. No issues on the ground or in the air. They went around with drinks and I thought they would provide snacks so I asked the attendant for a snack. I was surprised to later learn that snacks aren't free but the flight attendant never charged me. Return flight was delayed 30 minutes supposedly because of the issues in Chicago. Somebody made a snarky comment to flight attendant she definitely heard it but wisely ignored it. No other issues on the ground or in the air. It's always funny flying into Charlotte b/c majority of people aboard are switching planes. While others were making a mad dash to their next plane I was taking an easy stroll in the terminal.

The staff were very friendly and the whole experienced with US Airways was a very good one.

Over the summer my family and I flew to Fort. Myers on US Airways. On the way there we flew from Indianapolis to Charlotte to Fort. Myers. The flight was pretty average. On the way back though I have some complaints. We flew Fort. Myers to Washington Reagan to Indianapolis. On the flight back to Indy from Washington we were on a smaller Embraer jet. The Plane's condition was terrible. Multiple overhead bins were broken and at my seat the wall panel was falling off! I could see the insulation of the plane. Also all over my seat belt was gum. It was very disgusting and I could not change seats because it was a full flight. I'm willing to give US Airways another chance though. I would also recommend them to a friend because 3/4 flights were alright.

PHL-LAX-PHL September 3-9. I went out to Los Angeles for a vacation on US Airways. When I arrived at Philadelphia airport to my surprise the check-in and TSA lines were not crowded at all for it being a Hub. As for the flight it was uneventful. It left on time and arrived to LAX few minutes early. Flight was smooth but trying to sleep and relax in those coach seats was uncomfortable. The flight coming back left on time as well and flight went smoothly. Since US Airways is about to be the only airline to be non-stop to between Philly and Los Angeles once Virgin America stops its flights in October looks I'll have no choice but to use US Airways as I personally hate connecting flights.

We traveled from Charlotte NC to Paris France in late August and had booked in Envoy class. Much to our total amazement we were loaded onto a 30 year plane with old business class seats that did not lie flat and were worn out and hard as a board it was like trying to sleep on a teeter-totter. They gave us an old ipad for entertainment. Food was horrible and the flight attendants went up front and closed the drapes. Impossible to get even a drink. When I called US airways they offered nothing for their false advertising. If we allow airlines to treat us with disrespect it will continue to happen. I know it won't make a difference but I nor my husband will ever fly US airways or American again. It is the only small way that we can voice or extreme displeasure about being treated so poorly. They didn't even respond to my email.

On our last US Airways trip the return from Athens was a complete disaster. I verified my seats and flights twice in the week before I left home. I brought a printed copy of the itinerary from their website. At the airport I was told that "you don't have seats on the first leg of your journey from Athens to Zurich (Swiss Air). I see your reservation but for some reason US Airways cancelled your seats on that portion of the trip. The flight is full you don't have seats call them. Step aside. I did call US Airways - on hold for long stretches while their personnel verified that it was the next day in Athens vs. where the customer service is located in the U.S. and while they tried to put me on a flight now leaving in 1/2 hour. We ran to the Lufthansa check-in as instructed - after repeated attempts to get tickets we were told by Lufthansa that they could see the reservation but US Airways hadn't completed the task and we couldn't get on board. I called US Airways again in front of the Lufthansa check-in (more time on hold despite explaining that we had less than 1/2 hour to get tickets clear security and get to the gate). They verified that the last agent had not completed our reservation in Lufthansa's system. They now instructed us to go to Swiss Air and get the same tickets since they were codeshare partners on the Lufthansa flight. While explaining that Swiss Air was where we started and on the other side of the airport the announcement closing that flight was made. US Airways then stated they could do nothing until the next day's flight to get us out. I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor reiterated that nothing from Athens was available until the next day. I told her that I could see online that several flights were available to European gateway cities that morning but was told that US Airways couldn't put me on those flights. She was more helpful when I offered to get us to any European gateway on my dime but then told me that all the flights from London Paris Rome Amsterdam Munich etc. were full. My wife tried again and did reach someone that routed us to Paris and home on Air France. Air France was a welcome change and they actually worked to correct more US Airways problems created during re-booking us. I always thought the day would come where US Airways would turn the corner and become a great airline (and I've waited a long time) but I've officially lost interest in being around to see it.

I fly with US Airways a lot and they are average nothing special. Flying from CLT-SAN we usually leave on time a few minutes early even. But ever since they removed inflight entertainment on their domestic flights a 5 hour flight on an A320 is a little long. Make sure to bring your own things for movies and music Airbus A320 was older with some signs of age and grime on it taffy stuffed into what used to be a power port on my armrest 2 skittles stuck to the carpet under my seat leather was worn as well. Cabin Crew were nice and attentive drinks and snacks were average though their marketplace meals are not as quality. Just a few days before our trip US Airways changed our flight numbers and if I had not looked at the reservation again I might have been in a little trouble in finding the gate. If you don't like spending a lot of money try not to bring huge suitcases that need to be checked as US Airways charges 25 extra dollars per bag each way. US Airways is an average airline nothing very special.

Flight US735 Manchester to Philadelphia on 2nd August cancelled due to - you have guessed it - maintenance problems. Managed to fly out on Monday 4th missing a full 2 days of holiday. We will never fly with them again perhaps we should have known they even messed up the return booking after they changed our route back and failed to book our granddaughter with us even though the flights had been "linked" they had a 7 year old flying on her own. The food was also inedible.

### US Airways customer review
I booked my trip through Orbitz. The trip was "must be there on time" type of trip. I was very pleased that check in was made easy to do online I had no problems with baggage as I carried only 1 bag with me. We traveled from DFW to Charlotte NC then onto Charleston WV. The plan for the first leg of the trip was excellent my only critique would be on that 2nd leg of the trip which was in a much smaller plane and the seats were pretty "snug". However we were on time the entire way there. On the way back our trip was delayed from leaving almost 2 hrs but there had been storms that had come through which had thrown many other flights off and I guess that was natures fault. All the staff was very friendly. They served only a beverage as our trips were short and I didn't mind. I would recommend us airways to anyone and look forward to flying with them again.

### US Airways customer review
Do not use this airline especially out of YEG. I have never complained about a flight before. We had the exact experience with a cancelled flight from YEG to PHX as a previous post David had because of crew members not showing up. This was a 6.20am flight and was cancelled while we were in line to board. US Airways were extremely rude in re-routing us it was a take it or leave it proposal. And my experience continues to be horrible as I continue to deal with their customer service. Do not use this airline!

### US Airways customer review
I paid extra to have shorter lay over times. Instead we were stuck on the San Juan airport for 5 hours because the plane was late and we missed our connecting flight. That was on the way to St Thomas. On our way home we were delayed again because they had maintenance problems. Sat in the airport another 3 hours than 4 hours then 5 hours before they finally got us on a plane.

I have just returned from a holiday to Las Vegas which went from Glasgow & stopped in Philly. I wanted to write a review as I read others before I left and they were mostly all really bad so I was terrified about what to expect. I'm pleased to say I was more than pleasantly surprised by my travel experience. All flights left on time and were early arriving we actually got back into Glasgow 45 minutes earlier than expected! Staff were pleasant the flight was smooth and there was plenty of room in our seats. Even the food was good it was free on the transatlantic flight and we just bought our own snacks for the domestic flight however all flights had complimentary drinks which was more than I expected on the domestic ones. I have to say it's a shame for those that have had a bad experience but I want people to know that it doesn't always have to be bad.

Flight 614 Phoenix to Atlanta was three times delayed. Instead of 9.50pm arrival on 9/1 we arrived at 3am on 9/2. In Phoenix after we loaded and taxied out a mechanical problem was encountered. We deplaned and two hours later got a new plane. Although entire plane was loaded we waited 45 minutes for the same two pilots to show up for this second aircraft. This plane finally pulled out of the gate about 7.20pm and after a short taxi back into another gate to check an allegation of a supposed "bulging window seal" on an A320 which a passenger claimed to have seen. You cannot see window seals from the interior of the aircraft. This supposed mechanical problem for which no repair measures were taken prevented us from leaving Phoenix until 9pm Pacific. It was a very unpleasant seemingly unnecessary experience as to the allegations of mechanical trouble on the second plane and the pilot delay in simply arriving at the aircraft.

I don't fly a lot but when I do I expect professional staff service. I have not have this issue with other carriers. Anyway I just got back from a trip to Myrtle Beach NC. Our connecting flight from Charlotte to MB was delayed 45 minutes. The plane was just there. When the announcer made the call she didn't announce our boarding zone. We waited and had to get up there. We told her we didn't hear her calling the zone she rudely replied "ah I did". Gate c29 on Tuesday 3ish 8/26/14. On our way back at gate c10 from Charlotte to Phil on Friday at 8.05pm 8/29/14 the announcer mumbled and lots of passengers didn't understand what he was announcing. We didn't know our boarding zone was called. Both times we didn't get a proper update on the flight status at Charlotte.

MUC-PHL-ORD on Sept 2. A330-200 from MUC - mechanical issue that delayed departure for almost 2 hours. They kept saying it would be 10 minutes but that stretched out every time. Once on board the flight was good - seat comfortable and good food. Great AVOD. Landed an hour late and ran through immigration and security to get to my ORD flight. A321 wasn't full - departed on time and sat on the runway for 2 hours due to a storm that came just as we were taken back to the terminal. Other planes were taking off so not sure if the reason they gave for the delay (air traffic couldn't route us around the storm) was honest. Landed 3 hours late in Chicago - crew was very friendly at least.

I was booked on a non stop flight from Philadelphia to Seattle. I arrived at the airport and was told that I was too late to check my baggage. They said I needed to be there 45 minutes before the flight departed and that I was 5 minutes too late. The woman at the desk was rude and uncooperative saying that the policy says 45 minutes and I was late. I found another agent and she said all that she could do was put me on another flight leaving 10 minutes later but it was not a non stop and I would get to sea title 5 hours later than the first flight. The policy I found online at their web site states you must be at the airport 30 minutes before your flight departs to check a bag. This is not the fist time I have had problems with US Airways since their take over by American but it will definitely be my last. I will never fly US Airways or American again.

### US Airways customer review
Travelled to Orlando via Philly and had a bad trip due to the incompetence of US Airways. Booked for a family of 6 (4 adults and 2 children 6 and 8) and was given split seats. I was told by the staff that we should ask the people who were in the seats next to some of us if they would move to let our family stay together. Got to Philly and heard a blurb over the tannoy so I went to the desk and asked about it and was abruptly told to wait. Asked again about sitting together only to be told the same thing again at least that's standardisation for you. The return flight was worse with inconsiderate flight attendants no back of the seat screen and again had to sort ourselves out with other families. I will never ever fly with US Airways again abysmal company.

Trip from Rio to Toronto via US Charlotte (US Airways hub). One plane was canceled without any information to passengers. Staff were rude and not accommodating. Difficult to believe that being in the hub no other planes were available. It looks like their planes get a lot of mechanical problems. After my letter to airline requesting partial reimbursement for the ticket and meals during the 6 hrs of delay I was offered credit/points which I should use within one year. I am not planning to fly with US Airways anyway so there credits/points are useless.

Against my better judgement I used our compensation from our cancelled US Airways flights to SFO in summer 2013 to (partially) pay for flights to Florida this summer. On the way home to Dublin Phil/Dub flights cancelled after 6 hours of zero info. Put on flights to Chicago the next day. Chicago/Dublin flight cancelled that night after 5 hours of zero information. I managed to book my family onto a 'decent' airline (Aer Lingus) and we made it onto a flight that night after lots of running between terminals. Two weeks later our bags have not arrived. I plan to drive to Dublin airport today and demand our bags back.

ORD-PHL-MUC on August 28. A320 from ORD to PHL - departed early and landed early. Crew was very friendly and came through multiple times for trash pick up after their drink run. Connection was 2 hours to a full A330-200 to Munich. Boarding was well organized. Had aisle seat in front part of economy - seat comfort was good and AVOD was slow but great content. Flight attendants were not unfriendly but not super friendly. Chicken for dinner was yummy and filling. Landed 30 min early to Munich. Overall I was impressed with my first international trip on US Airways. And couldn't beat the fare - bought 5 days ahead at $700 round-trip.

### US Airways customer review
The actual safety of the flight and the technical competence of the crew appears to be outstanding. But I would tell US Airways management that the customer service is only fair (C to a C-/D+). The flight attendants appeared stressed and not really emitting a feeling that they were glad to have the customers aboard. The food was two meatballs and one broccoli spear. I know economy class should not whine but the meal looked so pitiful. The movie for my cross Atlantic flight (going and returning 2 weeks later was the "Muppet Movie"). The earphones that were passed out for the movie did not work and the advertised other entertainment channels were not working either. US Airways has so much potential.

I was booked on a US Airways flight scheduled to depart from Philadelphia to Orlando at 6.50 am (that plane's first flight of the day). US Airways did not check and make sure that the plane was ready to go the previous night or earlier that morning so we went through an endless list issues with the plane. About 6.5 hours after its scheduled departure time (including over 5 hours of being forced to stay on the plane) US Airways cancelled its flight and left us all to find another flight. By the time all the mechanical issues were finally resolved there was bad weather in Orlando so conveniently the US Airways records state that the flight was cancelled due to weather issues. If the flight had left on time there would be no weather issues. Because they are now hanging their hat on the "weather issues" they have completely dismissed any responsibility they have for the numerous mechanical delays.

Booked over a month in advance for my wife and I. Then try to check in online the night before and they have us in different rows both flights. When I called the agent said maybe because we have different names. Really? So even if you book at the same time they assume you are not together? First flight we were able to get seats together arranged by agent at front desk but connecting flight the flight crew told us to ask people in the seats if they would switch with us. Thankfully a passenger was more accommodating than the airline staff.

### US Airways customer review
My wife and I recently traveled from our home in South Carolina to San Francisco and back. The trip west was uneventful and Delta was fine. But the US Air flight from San Francisco to Charlotte NC at 1.05pm on Aug 13 2014 we saw two attendants ahead of us but as only one taking boarding passes. There was a second attendant who was looking at everyone's carry-on bags. When my wife passed the boarding pass scanner she rudely told my wife she couldn't board because she had three carry-on items - a purse a book bag and an envelope. She made my wife put the envelope into the book bag. I have no clue what made this US Air employee so spectacularly unable to deal with the public on this day but it left a bad taste in my mouth. Nearly every passenger on the plane about 190 of us were commenting about the scene we had witnessed. And all felt the same as I. I flew the other half of my flight on Delta.

### US Airways customer review
Return flights from Manchester (UK) - Charlotte (USA) - Las Vegas (USA). Very disappointed with these flights. OK with the domestic flight you don't expect much. A seat which was comfy enough and one or two drinks runs. Bog standard plane no inflight entertainment and had to pay for wifi. Fine for the four hour domestic flight. Transatlantic though different matter. On a Boeing 757. Same comfy seats (all seats were in the extra legroom section but the actual seats were the same in normal economy). Very dated entertainment as in TVs down the centre isle therefore no choice what to watch or when. No wifi on the planes either. Even if it was the same wifi as on the domestic flight it didn't give the chance to use streaming services such as netflix etc. The result? A very boring 10 hours on a plane. Food was OK nothing special or bad apart from the kids meal. We reserved one for our 5 year old in case the normal meal was a bit too adult for a kids palate. As it turned out the normal meal would have been fine for ours. But the kids meal consisted of chicken nuggets or similar potato croquettes and sweetcorn followed by biscuits and grapes. Breakfast was a bagel with butter and jam. We had a lovely blueberry muffin. A bit of common sense would have been to keep the puddings and breakfasts the same throughout just change the main meal to suit. Drinks runs were at the start and the end of the flight only. You had to call them in between.

Business class BWI with transfer in Charlotte - LAX. First time I flew US Airways. On board service is ok but would not pay for business class again. It is overpriced for the slightly larger seat. Food is ok. The real problem came when we arrived at 22.00 at LAX. We were off loaded and waited by the baggage claim. Luggage did not arrive until about 30-40 mins later. That would not be a big problem. The problem came when about 10 of us did not receive our luggage. The luggage belt kept going but after about an hour it became obvious nothing else was going to come. I headed over to the luggage office and to my surprise the luggage was lined up to the other side by the entrance to the airport - you could have literally walked from outside make two steps take my luggage and leave and no one not even cameras would see you come in. I approached the staff and raised my concern plus why did my suitcase not come the normal way. She proceeded to tell me it came on earlier flight. After asking why would they not inform us via PA system - she advised me there was no PA system they could use. I asked why could she not make the 1 min. trip and let us know and save us time and concern. She said "not my problem".

Manchester - Orlando via Philly Orlando - Manchester via Charlotte. Outbound flight was ok on airbus A330 but food was terrible. The real fun began on the return flight. Having checked in (self service next to the desk) we discovered that although I had booked 3 seats together US Airways had decided to seat me away from my wife and young daughter). When I asked the attendant if he could change my seat to where I booked next to my family he replied "oh but yours is a nice seat". I replied "ok but I want to sit with my family as I had booked so can you please arrange it" to which he replied "oh but yours is a nice seat". Eventually he said "sorry I cannot do anything you will have to ask them in Charlotte". Eventually the lady at the gate managed to change my seat for me for the 1st flight but couldn't for the 2nd one and I would have to change it in Charlotte. Luckily the lady at the gate was sympathetic to my request and seated us all together for the Manchester flight. On boarding the flight (a 757 Aircraft) it was a very outdated plane for a transatlantic flight! The TV screens were down the aisles not in the back of the seats and worse still the one at the back where we were seated did not work for the entire flight. Again the food was very poor for the main meal but that was nothing compared to breakfast! This consisted of a single warm small muffin/cake and a cup of coffee or tea. When I asked where the breakfast was they replied "that's it". If I had to rate this airline I would give it a 1 out of 10 at the very most. I will not be using US Airlines again for travelling to the USA anytime soon.

August 13 2014. YEG to PHX flight booked for 6.20am departure. They do pre-board announcement about 6.00 but then immediately tell everyone to sit down and relax because crew not there yet. Then departure pushed back to 7.00am. No updates given and an hour later departure pushed back to 9.00am. Then 10.00am and now announce they will start trying to move people to other flights because still no idea when crew will arrive. Line up for 1/2 hour only to get to front and be told they are only re-accommodating people with connecting flights and since my final destination is PHX I have to wait because the plane will still be going which I know by past experience with US Airways is unlikely. Then departure pushed back to 11 and a while later to 12pm when they finally mark it cancelled. So 2 hours in line now to get re-accommodated. By this time all other options for the day are full best they can do is 2 days later! Rebook on another airline for next day. Never given explanation nor apology they seem to delay cancellations as long as possible so people find other flights on their own and then don't need to give any compensation because flight not cancelled. Terrible airline avoid at all costs.

We were due to fly Dublin - Charlotte - Orlando on 25th July. When we got to the airport our flight to Charlotte was delayed by 4 hours. Went to US Airways desk to mention we would miss our connection she was so helpful and got us to Gatwick with Aer Lingus and onto Orlando with British Airways. Returning home on 8th Aug and we had no problems Orlando to Charlotte on American Airlines and US Airways to Dublin. Having heard all the horrid reviews I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by my experience. I found US Airways flight attendants so nice and the flight was lovely.

I flew from New York to Honolulu for my brother-in-law's wedding. My first flight was delayed first because the toilet was clogged then because the breaks didn't work. The pilot made a nonchalant announcement 45 mins after we were stuck on the plane explaining the situation at last. We were delayed by 1.5 hrs and I missed my second flight from Phoenix to Honolulu. After speaking to many US Airways personnel who could not care less about me I managed to be rerouted through LA - that flight was also delayed by 1 hour due to an unexplained maintenance issue I was stuck in LA for a night - they did not help me find a hotel even though I practically begged them let alone pay for it. They didn't know where my luggage was. I took an American flight the next morning to HNL finding that my luggage was lost. It was found later in the day thanks to the AA staff at HNL airport. No US Airways personnel apologized offered to help or bothered to do their job. On the contrary they were rude non-caring and certainly not sympathetic. Overall a terrible experience.

We just flew back from vacation connected in Charlotte on our way back to Cincinnati. We get to our gate only to be told there was a gate change from E3 to E 38. Meanwhile we hear several announcements of delays and gate changes due to maintenance. We finally get to the gate and our plane left 40 minutes late - while the flight board displays the flight leaving at the original time. Once we get on the plane we inched along the runway for another 45 minutes before the pilot finally gave us an update. Meanwhile the flight attendant was welcoming us aboard US Airways Express - express really. She proceeds to tell us that we must pay for snacks ranging from $3.50 to $7.00 for wine and beer. This is the third bad experience we have had with US Airways in the 3 times we have flown them. I am done!

### US Airways customer review
Our opinion of US Airways is that their customer service is poor and their organisation falls apart when planes are cancelled. On our flight out US 722 from Dublin to Philadelphia the attitude of the US Airways Dublin check- in staff was somewhat aloof. The flight attendants were grumpy and did not appear to want to be doing their jobs. Our return flight from Philadelphia to Dublin went well until the captain ineptly described that they had a fault with the GPS and navigation systems in that they did not agree. However he described we would be OK as we were still over land and this would aid them to guide the plane back to Philadelphia. After 3 hours we were diverted to Philadelphia where we found that US Airways lacked in all areas of how to deal with this event. On landing the cabin crew simply said proceed to baggage terminal C where you will be accommodated. On arrival in Terminal C no clear instructions were given as to why to do next and there was no US Airways staff present who could organise the skeleton staff to help with everyone finding alternative flights. One staff member wandered around with a business card saying that you could go to the ticket desk or ring a number to make arrangements for other flights. However not everyone got this card and we had to help some families who were not made aware of this. After 3 hours of telephone calls and waiting in a queue US Airways did find us alternative flights and accommodation which was positive. However the staff guiding us in the queues were extremely rude and the US Airways staff member aiding families in the taxi rank to get taxis was completely out of her depth in this job. At one point there were about 30 of us queuing with a line a taxis waiting and a major argument between taxi drivers and staff. I honestly thought a few of the female passengers were going to break down in tears. Essentially our disappointment is not with the mechanical failure of the plane but in the very poor attitude of the US Airway staff and extremely poor leadership and organisation as soon we were left to our devices once the plane was returned to Philadelphia airport.

Tried to fly from Philadelphia to Bangor on 2 August. Waited over two hours for them to fix plane. They even boarded us and we taxied out to take off but they found yet another mechanical fault while we were on the runway. Returned and disembarked. Very rude ground crew. Flight then cancelled. Had to wait in a long line to be put on a new flight. Cabin crew from other flights dame and pushed in at the top of the line making our wait even longer! Could not believe how rude they were. Even though Philadelphia is a hub for them and the flight was fully booked they could not find an alternative aircraft. And lots seemed to be sitting around going nowhere. We took a flight to Boston. Very rude woman at the gate looked at my BA Silver card and yelled - You are not preferred customers! She did not even know who US Airways partner airlines are. We arrived in Boston on a plane with broken toilets. None working in Economy. There is always something broken on a US Airways plane. Our bags were sent to Bagnor. So we had to spend a night sleeping in our clothes and then drive out of our way to Bangor airport to collect them next day. I have never had a flight with this airline where the plane took off on time and everything on board worked. Many flights were cancelled. Even long distance ones from London. I will go out of my to never travel with this airline again.

### US Airways customer review
The weather was clear on July 4 2014. In fact US Air flight next to us was leaving for Los Angeles without any delay. Our flight (#1836) was cancelled due to "crew unavailable" and not due to weather. The "crew unavailable" referred only to the pilot. The flight attendants for this flight were all there ready at the door waiting to board. Before the flight was cancelled the announcement stated that we were "just waiting for the pilot". US air claimed that this could be due to a domino effect of an inbound flight not arriving on time. I would agree with them that it would be difficult to find a whole flight crews but in this case we were only waiting for the pilot. This situation was not due to an unforeseen circumstance yet they blame the weather for their mismanagement. They should have a stand by pilot for this situation. I consider myself a seasoned traveler and this is not my first time encountering flight delay or cancellation. Other airlines had not only provided me with an overnight stay at a nearby hotel but also had a bus ready to shuttle all the passenger to the hotel and provided us with an overnight kit. You have a choice you don't have to put up with US air mismanagement and constant delay.

I flew from Chicago to Philadelphia to Tel Aviv and back the same way. Overall this was a great experience. Checking in was quick and punctual even with Israel's necessary added security. Flights left in a timely fashion. Flight attendants were nice enough. On the 12.5 hr flight back from Tel Aviv we received 2 meals that were surprisingly good plus they came around with free beverages 3 times plus made regular trash runs. Inflight entertainment system also allowed you to see your trip progress though you had to push a little hard to select things. If that's your only complaint it's a good entertainment system. The Airbus A330-200s were smooth and quiet as were the A320-200s. My only complaint was the difficulty sleeping/seat comfort but I'm 6'7" so it was expected. It was the most comfortable flight I've been on. Overall it was a great experience and I'd gladly fly with US Airways again as long as the prices remain competitive. In everything that's actually consistent and important US Airways surpassed expectations.

### US Airways customer review
I flew from Las Vegas to Salisbury (Maryland). It was supposed to be a quick weekend trip. All I had was a small carry on and personal bag. They ran out of over head room and I had to check my suitcase in. I figured I would get it back once I reached Philly for my layover. They actually checked it in. Did not bother to tell anyone this. To make matters worse my connecting flight was delayed. Overall flight going was bearable despite the inconveniences. Returning however a whole other story. I arrived at the tiny airport an hour before the security check point was open. After getting through security with the 30 other passengers we waited about 20 minutes extra. We all board in an efficient manner. About 1/2 of us had to check in our small pieces of luggage because the plane was too small for it to be true carry on. So we board and are ready to take off. The pilot arrived we waited 15 minutes before taking off. I have 64 minutes of a layover. We get near philly and have to circle around then land. After landing we sit on the tarmac for 5 minutes in 2 different spots. I have less than 15 minutes to get to my gate. We deplane and wait for the ground crew to unload the "carry on" luggage. They move with no purpose. Most of the fight has less than 20 minutes to catch their next flight. I get my bag. No fault to the airline but my connecting flight is out of a different gate and I have to take a shuttle there. This trip takes about 7 minutes. I see my plane at the gate. By the time I got to the gate the plane was pulling away. After all of this the next day my flight took off about 45 minutes behind schedule. I had a horrible experience all around nor did the airline seem to b remorseful for the 12 hour inconvenience.

US0785 and US2888. 28th July 2014. Edinburgh to Philadelphia / Philadelphia to Cleveland. What a terrible airline. The staff are ignorant and unfriendly the aeroplanes are old and dated looking. I used this airline via 4 separate flights within 1 week and I will never do it again! Even the US Airways ground staff were ignorant and unhelpful. I missed my connecting flight due to standing at Customs (Philly) for 2 hrs and the plane was still at the gate when I finally arrived. However they then told us that the flight was oversold anyway! Then shoved onto standby for the next 2 flights only to be told that they were full and to come back the next morning. The staff were hopeless! I had to pay for my own hotel room and not even so much as a sorry!

The plane bound from Athens Greece to Philadelphia Pennsylvania broke down and we waited in the plane for an hour and a half. In Philadelphia I went through customs like clock work. I dropped my baggage off for my connecting flight to Chicago and here is where the problems started. My baggage got on another flight and not with mine. At Chicago I rushed to get the baggage so I could catch the next coach to my final destination of South Bend IN regional airport where I was to pick up a rental car. This was not the case. Ground staff of US Airways gave me the run around for two hours plus. Finally consulting with the ground security I asked kindly if the staff could check their computer and locate my baggage. The ground staff told me my baggage would arrive after 9pm by which time I would have lost the last coach to Indiana. I told them to forward my baggage to my motel the next day. My baggage came after three days and a long struggle.

US Airways 502 and 1836 on July 21st 2014. Having read the reviews on this site I became quite nervous about flying with US Airways! What were they going to do to me? To my luggage? What lies would they make up? So happy to say I had a completely non-eventful perfectly normal flight with pleasant flight attendants punctual timing useful information and all my baggage arriving on time and in good condition. Better legroom than some airlines I've been on. Helpful friendly people all through. Twice we were served beverages - no food so that might be my only gripe but it's a small one really. I think it's important to write a review even when things go well to counteract all the bad ones on here. Flight from Mexico City to Las Vegas via Phoenix.

BWI to CLT. Gate agents and flight crew provided conflicting information to passengers causing unnecessary confusion on multiple accounts and required zone 5 boarding passengers to gate check carry-on bags containing electronics when ample overhead bin space was indeed available. As a frequent flyer I have watched as this carrier has gone way downhill since the unfortunate merger with American. I hope to be able to avoid them as much as possible in the future.

IAH to BWI - 7/26/14. I was forced to check-in my small carry-on bag at the gate. I am allowed to carry a personal item and a small carry-on bag and I had packed accordingly. I had my important financial documents and laptop in my carry-on. The agents at the gate were very rude and inflexible and I was forced to take out my laptop and the binder full of financial documents and carry them on the plane and they checked-in my almost empty suitcase! To make matters worse I got on the plane and discovered that the overhead bins all around my seat were empty. I have been flying for a long time and this has never happened with any other airline. I did not appreciate being forced into a situation with no options and being told by the agent at the gate to look for another flight if I did not check-in my bag. The staff need training in customer service. If my ticket states I am allowed to carry a small carry-on bag into the plane and there is room on the plane then there is no reason to be forced to check my bag. Incidentally this is the second time I had a bad experience with US Airways. A few years ago another rude gate agent yelled at me for carrying a bag for my husband who was on crutches! The agent insisted that my husband had to carry his own bag even though he is on crutches. Needless to say I will not be flying US Airways again.

My family and I flew from PHL to Rome Italy. Our 2 year old son has a severe peanut allergy. I called in advance to ask if I could board early to clean his seat and if they could make an announcement regarding the allergy. I do not expect anyone to change their eating habits we just wanted to make those immediately around us aware. I was told on the phone it is up to the individual crew the day of our flight. When we boarded the plane I asked a member of the crew. She said she would check. As I was seated a flight attendant came up to me and said in a condescending tone "It is our policy that we do not make any exceptions for those with food allergies. We cannot guarantee anything and we do not make announcements. We do not serve peanuts but other people can eat what they want. We just informed the people directly around us and they were more than understanding. The staff were just rude in general. My mother-in-law got up to get something that fell on the floor for my daughter. The flight attendant barked at her to move. She said "Move we are coming through with the cart. Where is common courtesy? When they came around with the beverage cart they merely said "Drink"? At first we gave the airline the benefit of the doubt thinking it was only this crew. On our return to PHL the crew was worse. We didn't ask them to make an announcement as we knew the response would be the same. We did however inform the flight attendant of our son's allergy. During the flight I came out of the bathroom to notice that a woman was dipping her pretzels in peanut butter. I calmly asked the flight attendant if I could move away because of the peanut butter. She looked at me and said "What do you want me to do"? I said "I cannot stand here with him for long. She scoffed and said facetiously to her partner " We need to move because this kid has an allergy. I should also note that the company said it does not serve peanuts or peanut products on the plane: however the pretzels handed to everyone were from "King Nuts. The package clearly stated that it may contain traces of peanuts and tree nuts. Clearly US Airways does not recognize the severity of the allergy.

June 21-22 2014 HNL-TPA by way of PHX. First Class. First leg fine nice crew comfy seat decent meal. Second leg - not so much! Almost 4 hour flight landing in TPA at 6.30 am - breakfast should have been served but all we got was a teeny bag of not very good pretzels. When questioned about this shabby treatment US customer relations (first time around) said that no meal should have been served. Upon a second communication they said sorry yes - breakfast should have been served. Their solution was to offer a small voucher (which expires in a year) toward a future US flight which is completely useless to me as my travel plans for the coming year are already in place. They feel this represents some kind of value and is acceptable as reparation for the shabby treatment. The seats were uncomfortable they had a built in pillow which prevents you from putting your head back. It is not removable. So if you book first class on US make sure you find out what you're paying for - you may not be getting much. They have lost this customer.

Flying out of Shannon Ireland we arrive at the airport to discover our flight to Philly has been cancelled. The flight was canceled the previous day. Mechanical issues". At least we get a night in a hotel w/meals. The next day we get out of Ireland to Philly - board for next connection only to sit on tarmac. Pilot tells us there is bad weather in Charlotte. Once we take off pilot gets on intercom to ask flight crew to stay seated through the flight due to turbulence. In 1st class drinks and food being served throughout the flight no turbulence encountered. This is all suspicious to us as on our flight out of the U.S. we got delayed on the tarmac until the crew timed out thank goodness Delta helped us get us out! I think the canceled flight from Shannon was actually a case of USAir wanting to fly a fuller plane.

I was taking two US Airways flights on my return trip from a cruise Miami to Charlotte (their hub) and then Charlotte to Dayton Ohio. I waited in Miami airport all afternoon for my evening flight and it wasn't until it was about boarding time that they updated the flight boards to show the plane was delayed. They started calling people up to try to get them on different flights but by that time it was too late for me to get on another good connecting flight. The gate agent couldn't find any other good connections except for the flight from Charlotte to Dayton that wouldn't leave again until the next morning. The Miami to Charlotte flight ended up being 1.5 hrs late due to mechanical issues. We quickly boarded as just about everyone had a connecting flight that night. Staff onboard were rude and terse with everybody. They could have at least given us some empathy and info on where to go inside their hub to get new connecting flights but they didn't. Once we finally landed and everybody got up to leave then they finally announced that all the connecting flights for the evening have already left. I got in line at their customer service desk and heard them repeating the same things like robots: "no vouchers" "due to weather" "we can't help you. Mind you we were told it was mechanical issues in Miami and now they were claiming it was the weather. I was lucky that I managed to get a hotel voucher after the lady next to me pressed the issue but I don't know if anyone else got one and made my way back to the airport in the morning. This whole ordeal taught me to never fly US Airways again and always pack enough stuff in your carry on to last a night in an airport if it ever gets delayed.

### US Airways customer review
Extremely dissatisfied with the lack of communication with US airways. Got to Charlotte for my flight to Nashville and the plane was delayed 30 minutes because we didn't have a pilot who could get here on time. The flight was delayed another 2 hours as the pilot who supposedly was supposed to be flying us the entire time was just now leaving Chicago to come and get us. Then the flight attendants left. We had no crew and pretty sure there was no pilot for this flight to begin with. Will never use this airline again.

BOS to ONT with a tight Connection in PHX. Due to weather sat on the tarmac in Boston for an hour jeopardizing PHX connection. Flight crew announced that they know many passengers have connections in PHX so upon arrival please let these passengers out first. I ask the flight attendant if they have any specific info on the connector flights (no access to any information). We arrive at the gate the people get ready to run. Then they announce don't bother - all flights have left - go directly to the customer service area for instructions. I deplane check the board and see that my flight has also been delayed. I run and get to the gate just in time. I had upgraded to first class but they told me I lost my seat. They give me my new coach seat and I board. I was pleasantly surprised that my bag did make it on my plane.

I have never flown US Airways before and I never will again! Their customer service is well there is no customer service! We arrived to the airport after confirming that our flight was on time only to find that our flight was delayed 2 hours to Phoenix. It was supposed to be the first leg of our Anniversary trip to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. We finally got on the plane and of course our next flight out of Phoenix left without us. There were no planes to Puerto Vallarta that day. The agent gave us a number to call to get a hotel either for free or for a discount and neither were true. We spent the night in Phoenix when we should have been in Mexico. We upgraded to first class to make up for the disaster and made it to PV just fine. We thought that the return trip couldn't be bad but we pulled away from the terminal and sat on the runway for 30 minutes had to go back to the terminal and wait an additional 1.5 hrs on the plane before take off! The delay was blamed on communication / paperwork issues with the PV airport. No extra drinks. Meanwhile we had a connecting flight out of Phoenix and visions of the same thing happening all over again played in our heads. Luckily our connecting flight was delayed so as we reassess through immigration to customs to picking up our bags and running to the gate we made it home.

FLL-PHL in economy. I flew down to FLL in first and had low expectations for economy but was once again pleasantly surprised. FA's well groomed and very polite clean cabin and restrooms throughout the flight and an on-time arrival despite numerous thunderstorms in our way. I hope this is the norm and not the exception and I hope that the merger with AA does not change things for the worse. All that being said it would have been nice to have some in-flight entertainment - none is provided on US Airways domestic.

I took USAir to Hawaii from St Louis and it was horrible. The planes are so small and I was so cramped. They didn't offer anything to eat on a 6 hour flight and when they did offer something to drink it was one time because they ran out of drinks. The staff was not any better they seemed to hate their jobs. Then the movie was the same going there and back and I could only see half the screen because the roof was in the way. The headphones didn't work well.

### US Airways customer review
No entertainment on a 6 hour flight staff at PHL airport are rude and knowledgeable. The airplane looked like it was built in 1950 and the crew were so unhelpful and rude. we paid over $680pp for RT tickets to PHL from LAX. They told me they had no more food then I watched them serve food to a woman who asked 30 minutes later.

PHL-FLL in First booked with British Airways Avios miles. I had very low expectations for this flight but I was pleasantly surprised to find a friendly crew clean business class sized seats and priority treatment for my luggage upon our on-time arrival to FLL. Although no meal was offered FA's came around multiple times offering snacks and followed up with me throughout the flight on alcoholic drink refills. I'm not sure if this service is worth paying full price for as it does not come with lounge access and you have to pay for use of in-flight wifi which I think is inappropriate for a first-class experience. That being said the seats are much better that BA's Club Europe product where you are provided with the same seats as in economy but with the middle seat blocked off.

6/24/14 on a round trip from Honolulu to Denver. I arrived at HNL airport before the recommended 2 hour time prior to take off. Upon my arrival I noticed that the plane was already at the gate. They loaded the first group of passengers and then the gate personnel said that there was a problem with the air conditioning so everyone had to deplane. This plane was at the gate for over 2 hours and no one noticed that the AC was out? We finally take off 1.5 hrs late. We arrived at Phoenix and I had to run to my next connection gate. I barely made my connection flight to Denver but my carry-on which I was told to check at the gate because there was no room on the plane did not make it. My return trip back to Honolulu was even worse. Again I got to the airport 2 hours prior to boarding. A plane was at the gate but the gate agent told me that it wasn't my flight. The gate agent assured me that this would be the gate for boarding. Half hour prior to boarding the gate agent tells everyone that we need to switch gates then we had to wait another half hour for another plane to taxi out of the gate. When my flight finally arrived at the gate it was discovered that one of the rear emergency masks was faulty. Again we have to wait. We are finally allowed to board on the plane a half hour after the scheduled boarding time to wait another two hours to take off. First the pilot says they have to refuel then we couldn't take off because of weather. This caused me to miss my connection flight to Honolulu from Phoenix. While I was waiting to take off I get an email from US Airways that due to the delay and me missing my connection flight I was being moved to another flight connecting from PHX to LAX and then to HNL but the flight wasn't until the next day and no mention of them paying for a place for me to stay. My wife was able to convince an agent to put me on an American Air flight that would get me back to Hawaii on that day. I will never fly US Airways again.

### US Airways customer review
My experience has been terrible and is yet to be over. My flight was cancelled due to weather which is not unreasonable. They (US Air customer service) set me up for a stand by flight the next day - I go to gate and even though I have a boarding pass they have no record of me so I am up to the bottom of the list and I did not get a seat - even though in discussing things with the other 3 stand by passengers I was in fact on stand by first. All three of them got a seat. Then they book me the next day to go to NY and take a Delta Connector. This time customer service does it wrong and I have no reservation on Delta and am now sitting in NY with no place to go. I am now 2 nights and 3 days into my delay. So they send me back to Philly from NY to get on an 8.40 flight that is oversold tonight. Who knows what will happen at 8.40!

July 2 flight from Philadelphia to Detroit cancelled after it was boarded. We noticed it was half full. At first no reason given by the crew. Upon talking to the ticket agent the reason given was because of storms in the area. Funny thing my daughters flight same day same time to Washington DC heading straight into the east coast hurricane got off. We were only given a voucher for reduced hotel rate and told it was an "act of God". Will never fly US Airways again.

### US Airways customer review
I've been flying for more than 24 years in and outside the United States. I have never flown US Airways before but did it because it's the only available flight for a last minute flight. My flight was 20 minute delayed from Portland our plane landed in Phoenix and had 20 mins to spare to get on my next flight to Milwaukee however I missed my connecting flight. The man next to me said he was there 15 minutes early and the door was already shut. US Airways knows when their plane touch down and no way they should shut the doors unless they oversold their tickets on a regular basis. I felt so bad for the staff that they have to go through all this chaos of passengers missing their connecting flights. This is absolutely the worst airline I've ever flown. They knew that they overbooked why would you close the door when you still have 15 minutes before the flight takes off. I feel bad for others who likes to fly cheap and they think they are getting a great deal.

### US Airways customer review
Something has happened to US Airways in the last couple of months that has affected the moral and attitude of staff. I make a three leg trip Manchester - Ohio - Florida - Manchester four times a year and have done for the last two or three years without issue until this last flight. 1) Baggage issues with the intermediate leg. US Airways computers do not register that the intermediate leg is part of a international journey and so flag up a checked baggage fee. Normally someone is on hand to over-rule the glitch and apply the correct code but this relies on the staff wanting to be helpful. I was treated outrageously by the so called supervisor in Cleveland last week and rather than argue the point any further i just paid and walked away so as not to cause delays to waiting passengers behind me. 2) The latest return leg to Manchester was the worst display of cabin crew attitude that I have ever experienced. Lying about a row of empty seats and saying they were empty for weight and balance issues when in fact they were subsequently used for the cabin crew to sleep on. Also to be refused a top up of wine with the meal (they were slow delivering the meal) but offering to sell me a $7 bottle instead was just pathetic. It was my intention to spend $200 or so on duty free gifts as I normally do but on this occasion - I decided not to.

### US Airways customer review
My experience and that of numerous other passengers that I spoke with is that US Airways has an unacceptable rate of delays missed connecting flights and cancellations that is caused primarily by their failure to schedule appropriately. We had not mechanical issues or weather delays but our airplane left 25-30 minutes late from a small airport in Bangor Maine (i.e. not a lot of airport traffic either). I arrived at my connecting flight in Philadelphia to watch the doors close and the plane depart but absolutely no effort was made to have the plane wait an extra 5-10 minutes for the passengers that had just landed. In fact there wasn't even a US Airways representative at the gate to speak with. In addition if you miss a flight and have to stay overnight you should not expect any assistance from US Airways.

### US Airways customer review
My first flight was late. I ran across the airport to make my connection. They are supposed to close the gate ten minutes before and I made it with four minutes to spare. They had closed the door early and wouldn't let me through. There is nothing more frustrating than to watch people boarding the plane you are supposed to be on. The attendants were rude and no one wanted to help. There was a disabled lady who had also missed because she needed transportation help and they got her there late. No one would help her either which I thought was just wrong. The attendants couldn't have cared less. They wouldn't even acknowledge we were there. The other lady was stranded and couldn't even get anyone to call someone to come get her. I don't know maybe I was supposed to get mad and ugly but that has never been me and it shouldn't be necessary to get someone to show you courtesy.

Flight after flight last night (26 June 14) late in the evening was being cancelled at Philadelphia all for "mechanical reasons. Are they having labor problems? US Airways counter staff unhelpful in getting me to RDU for important presentation Friday morning said there was no excess capacity and it could be up to a day before I got home. American Airlines Platinum desk was able to get me on an eatlier flight that had been delayed for so long for "mechanical reasons" that it was still in Philly. I got on and after another hour finally left. So my delay was cured by someone else's.

### US Airways customer review
A most uncomfortable experience. Flew from Maui to Sky Harbor Phoenix. The crew cabin crew were inattentive and disinterested. For a five and a half hour flight thru the night they had one beverage run. Did not return after some 4 hours to offer even water. We traveled with two 13 year old granddaughters who were in a different part of the cabin. My wife attempted to alert a flight attendant that they were alone and to let us know if the needed anything and was bruskly brushed off. There was no announcement about the impending landing until the last moment. There was overall a very uncaring attitude which make me feel like a worthless commodity. I am an experienced traveler but this stands out as the worst flight I have experienced.

### US Airways customer review
Flew from Manchester to Philadelphia - only direct flights there are. I think another time I'll go via Heathrow and travel BA where at least there will be some service. Cabin crew were slovenly and disinterested and spent most of the flight telling each other how tired they were and one chewed gum the entire journey. Food was disgusting and the entertainment consoles are a joke totally unresponsive and you nearly break a finger prodding at the screen to try and get it to do something. Dreadful.

Flight 734 from Philadelphia to Manchester UK cancelled 40 mins before take-off due to "maintenance". Staff unhelpful one leaving customers to go home. Next days flights started with a two hour delay due to air-con problems. Inflight cabin crew surly and nearly threw food at us. No interaction with passengers. Cheap but not cheerful. Its the last time we will use US Airways. I'd rather pay a bit more to get a reliable and customer friendly service. In summary an awful experience.

After an 8 hour flight from Dublin we arrived in Charlotte just after noon we had an 8 hour layover in Charlotte until our final flight to Virginia I realized that then that there were seats available for an earlier flight to VA at 2.30 so I went to the customer service desk where no one was in line there were 3 US airways staff at the desk. The first of the 3 looked put off because I apparently interrupted her conversation with her co-workers. I asked her if I could the 2.30 flight and she informed me she could for a 75 dollar per person seat reservation. I gave in and paid and gave her our baggage tickets I asked her will our bags be there with us when we land? She said that by paying the 150$ our bags were guaranteed to be there when we land. We landed. No bags. So I went to the US Airways desk in Newport News where there were five other customers who had issues with bags we waited for over an hour while the front desk phone rang and rang and rang until finally someone came out. Only to be told that she didn't have the key to look in the lost baggage area she said she'd be right back (never came back). Finally someone came to help my bags never left Charlotte. I'll never fly US Airways again.

### US Airways customer review
I had read horrible reviews about U.S Airways while planning my trip so I specifically went to American Airlines website paid $100 more for my tickets and booked my flight through American Airlines. I received all my email confirmations from American Airlines. When I arrived at the airport I went to American Airlines check in they tell me they don't have that flight. In very small print at the bottom of my confirmation it said U.S. Airways. I went over to the U.S. Airways check in counter to check my bag. I was flying with a firearm so they have to inspect it. My flight was set to leave at 7.45 am. While sitting at the gate waiting you could see they were working on our plane. Then came time to board and they told us it would be just a little while longer. They finally started boarding us at 8.00 am. At 9.00 we were still sitting on the runway waiting on mechanics at 9.30 they deboarded us from the plane and said it would be about 10.30 am before we departed. Sat at the gate area and at 11.30 they cancelled our flight. They gave everyone a card with a phone number to call to get on another flight. I called and got on an 8.45 pm flight that night. I sat at the airport for 16.5 hours waiting for the next flight to leave at 5.30 I got a phone call from U.S Airways saying the flight would be delayed until 9.30 pm. When I got to the gate it was pushed back to 9.50 pm. Finally after much hesitation I had to call and take myself off the flight and find my luggage. When I looked up that flight later it did not actually leave until 10.45 pm. When I went to go claim my luggage after about 30 minutes of not being able to locate it they discovered it was in Phoenix. It apparently made it on an earlier flight that it was not tagged for. I finally got it back at 8.30 pm the following evening.

Airplane itself seemed newer than the planes I have been on in the past (I usually fly Delta). But after a 10 hour flight from Rome to Charlotte we arrive to find out flight to Tallahassee was cancelled. The customer service person was polite but kept getting distracted as she rebooked us on a Delta flight to get us home 4 hours later than originally planned. Our luggage made it the next day. I started researching and find out that cancelled flights are a frequent problem on US Airways. Don't fly them if you want to get where you are going on time!

### US Airways customer review
Some friends and I booked flights from Nashville to St. Thomas. From there we were to take a cab to a ferry to Marina Cay. Lo and behold our flight was delayed due to maintenance. This caused us to miss the last ferry out resulting in a hotel stay in St. Thomas. As if that were not bad enough. one week later on our way back to the US we arrived at the St. Thomas airport three hours early for our flight. None of the kiosks worked to check in and there wasn't a single employee working. Luckily we had so much time. The passengers flying out on an earlier flight had experienced much worse panic when they were unable to check in to their flight that was leaving in less than an hour. Once all eight employees arrived at the same exact time we waited in a ridiculous long line of frustrated people. Happy to finally get to our gate we learned that our flight was delayed due to maintenance again!

### US Airways customer review
US Airways now stoops to lying. Boarding my flight today I had to sit through the usual nonsense announcements that the flight is fully booked and overhead luggage storage is limited so customers should come up to the podium to check their bags. In the past I have ignored these pleas and I have not had a problem. I never check my baggage if I can help it because the best case is that you waste 30 to 45 minutes at your destination waiting for your bags to come down the carrousel. Worst case the airline loses your baggage or locks it up and leaves for the day because you make the mistake of going to the washroom before going to the carrousel. Today US Airways didn't achieve their quota of checked baggage so they decided to step it up a notch and report that one passenger has already come to the front of the airplane to check his baggage because the overhead storage is completely full so I dutifully went to the podium to check my bag. What do I find when I board the plane? Lots of available overhead storage. I am completely incensed at this behaviour and will not fly US Airways again if I can help it.

We flew Houston-Charlotte-Lisbon (5/24/14). Flight 760 over wasn't too bad food was ok for coach. It was booked for us by Road Scholar as part of our travel package. I didn't have high expectations but it wasn't bad for being economy. The return US 761 (6/2/14) was the trip from hell starting with the oldest 757 I've ever flown. Late leaving Lisbon stupidest security personnel ever encountered. The front economy toilet had been repaired with putty glue you name it didn't work properly. Crew just plain didn't give a flip about passengers or service on board. Luckily both flights were about 50-60% full so you could stretch out. I will avoid this airline like the plague and any variation the merger with AA cooks up - even if I pay extra.

Manchester UK - Philadelphia - New York. Totally satisfied great food modern inflight entertainment crew was nice flight delayed by 90 mins - did not bother me. People at the desk in Philadelphia very helpful. Was worried about this trip after reading only negative reviews but I must say I was very pleased. I fly the US - EU route every month (always a different airline though). I would definitely recommend US Airways.

### US Airways customer review
I was very unhappy with my trip - flights delayed both ways and of course the connecting flight couldn't wait. I made a mad dash across the Charlotte airport from Concourse B to E (or was it the other way round?) to try to catch it though there were less than 5 minutes; I guess I hoped it might be delayed just a little bit too. But no they don't wait. On the way back two days later the Charlotte flight was delayed twice then cancelled so I got a non-stop to Miami at 7 pm rather than my original 12.50 flight. More than 6 extra hours waiting in the airport with nothing offered to make up for it. Oh yes I got switched to American since they're now the same company but US airways personnel couldn't assign my seat and I had to wait until actual boarding to get a back row seat. I think I will avoid this airline in the future if at all possible! In-air personnel were very nice about fixing my drink the way I liked it so I'll rate them higher.

### US Airways customer review
When I was traveling to Phoenix on 5/29/2014 I had purchased a ticket leaving Spokane at 9am in the morning and arriving at 11.30. However when I printed out my boarding pass it now showed that I was to arrive at the airport at 6am and arrive in Phoenix at 9.30am. I was now stuck at the airport for 5 hours! I was not notified of the change as had to scramble to find a new ride to the airport much earlier than I had expected! This is very inconvenient! There was no email or phone call to notify that this had changed. When I departed Phoenix on 6/1/2014 I again got my boarding pass and was told to proceed to gate B10. 10 minutes before my flight should have boarded myself and 5 other passengers were looking for someone at the gate for B10 no one was there! We flagged down another airport worker and were notified that our plane was now going out of gate A3! Again no notification email or update on the US Airways phone app to let us know that the gate had changed. As it was I and the other passengers had to run to make the flight departure at gate A3. I am physically able to do this. I know that an elderly passenger would not have been able to make it as it was quite a distance away in the terminal. This is not acceptable. Any changes and corrections in flight times and gates should be updated by US Airways on the website or an email/phone app should be notified. This should lay solely on US Airways to get this information out. As it stands this was my first and last flight with US Airways and I will go out of my way to NOT fly your airline again. I was not happy with these changes and the inconvenience it provided for me.

I just came home from a week in Ireland and flew US Air from Shannon to Philadelphia. After spending a week with friendly helpful smiling people in Ireland I encountered the least friendly rudest crew I have ever seen on any flight. The flight wasn't just Americans returning home but Irish people flying to America for maybe the first time. What a terrible impression they must have made! First of all they were a mess - they didn't even appear clean. No one said hello how are you etc. Food service (and the food) was terrible. Two of the women flight attendants were arguing in the aisle over the beverage cart about how to dispose of cans. I asked for a cup of tea with milk and sugar and got one milk. When I asked for another milk you would have thought I asked her for champagne. I swear I saw some of them roll their eyes at people. When we arrived we were welcomed to Philadelphia by "your Philadelphia-based crew" - what a bunch of miserable unhappy impolite people. They are all in the wrong profession. On the way off the aircraft no one said goodbye have a nice day or anything. It was my worst flight experience ever. US Airways needs to work on customer service. Another observation was at Philadelphia airport while sitting at the gate for my connecting flight.

What a nightmare. Numerous delays and cancellations both going to and returning from my business destination. Staff rude and unhelpful. Planes dirty. Multiple reports of mechanical difficulties or weather as cause of delays but no other airline seemed to have weather issues. I needed help getting another flight to get home to my son. The attendant at the gate told me to "Try Delta. Guess what? I will.

While flight was diverted from PHX to CLT upon arrival in CLT flight was delayed continually while changing gates 3 times - for 5 hours! Finally at 1.30 in the morning they tell us the flight is cancelled because they don't have a Pilot! They left hundreds of people to sleep on the floor of the Charlotte airport. Not even offered a bottle of cold water.

Since February US Air has been an unmitigated disaster. Had 2 early morning flights back to back in Tampa cancelled on 2 brand new Airbus 320. Then a cancelled flight due to a bent fan blade in Ottawa where I then had to spend the night. Ground operations in Charlotte are a joke and even with 2 hr layovers I have had to scramble to make my connections. Then last night in Washington all is good until 30 min before departure then I get the email notice flight is cancelled. Call US Air. Cancellation due to another mechanical issue on a CRJ 200. I then chose to drive the 3 hours home. These US Air personnel are a joke. The passengers are held as hostages with one pack off lies told on top of another. You just hope you show up at your destination the same day you leave.

Planned family trip to Europe with family fight from Charlotte to London Heathrow (flight 730) on May 15 2014. Flight was delayed 4 times then cancelled at 1 am no hotels in Charlotte due to Nascar race no help from US Air reps actually all rude family had to sleep in airport got $10.00 food voucher that buys a lot in airport. Next morning. Put on flight to LaGuardia almost didn't make because they had our luggage locked up in Charlotte no one there to unlock until flight time very stressful got to LaGuardia had to pay for cab to JFK then wait until 6.30 pm for flight to London. Will avoid at all costs.

### US Airways customer review
This has been the most stressful trip I have taken. Hearing my flight have been canceled 2 times waiting at the airport for 6 hours and having to wait in lines with 100+ people is the worst thing that has happened in all of my trips I've taken with an airline. I reached my mid-way point in Charlotte North Carolina rushing to my flight that was suppose to take off in 30 minutes. They then announce that the flight has been canceled and that we go visit the service desk. Almost about an hour wait. Once I got to talk to one of the service agents she was really rude and barely communicated with me. She then found me a flight 4 hours from then. The flight attendants then told us to walk to a different gate to a later time to fly to Nashville. I am never going to be looking at US Airlines to fly again.

### US Airways customer review
Delays on all booked flights. Outward bound - Dublin to Philadelphia Philadelphia to Vegas. Vegas to LA. Baggage did not make the connection from Phil to Vegas. arrived some hours later. Cabin staff were unfriendly and quite rude. From Dublin We were sitting at the back of the plane and there was no selection of meal available and we were told "thats what you get when you travel at the back" . I opened my little tub of butter which had been heated to the extent that when I opened it it was in hot liquid and went all over my hand. I said to the stewardess who was passing by who could have brought me a napkin to wipe the liquid off my hands - but she sped by saying "oh I know that happens". Only that I had a tray of food on my lap she would have had more to deal with! We were told by cabin crew that all baggage was to be stored in the overhead lockers or underneath the seat in front. This obviously does not apply to cabin staff whose baggage was piled high on the back centre aisle seats of the plane it was not secured in any way. Their baggage was a danger to all the passengers in that area. Maybe the company should practice what they preach and put staff baggage in the hold. Cabin crew were ungroomed in appearance. Homeward bound to Dublin. Flight from Philadelphia to Orlando delayed resulting in us overnighting in Orlando  very grateful for the overnight accommodation provided at the Hyatt. Flew to Charlotte the next day for flight to Dublin. Boarding for Dublin at Charlotte was very confused and inefficiently exercised by Gate staff - resulting in delay in take-off. Entertainment delivery was of very poor quality on those flights that had the facility. General impression overall. Very Disappointing.

### US Airways customer review
This flight was conducted like a zoo. Three women with their children on the flight requested to change their seats. Passengers and the flight attendant tried to comply with their request. Actually they farmed all their kids out and the 3 mothers sat together drinking wine for the whole flight. Their children did not fasten their seat belts until other passengers reminded them too. The plane had to move after attempting to attach the new jetway without success. Nobody instructed the passengers to sit down so people were going to the bathroom children were jumping on the seats and luggage was in the walkway while they moved the plane to a new jetway. The flight attendant was not looking out for anyone's safety. I could not wait to get off this plane!

### US Airways customer review
Terrible. I had two flights which connected in Philadelphia. The first was 5.5 hours long from San Francisco to Philadephia; no entertainment whatsoever no complimentary snacks and extremely uncomfortable seats. The second was from Philadelphia to Toronto; delayed 3 hours due to maintenance all of the food service had closed in that Terminal at 8pm. I had just come off the 5.5 hour flight and was starving. We finally boarded the flight attendant was very rude. I asked if there was any way I could have any nuts or something as I was so hungry he rudely said "No this is a short flight I'm sure you will survive. (There was no other food service offered). The flight was only about an hour: they continually shut off all the lights as if people were to sleep and they turn all the fluorescents on again - this happened 5 or 6 times within the hour. I will never fly US Airways again unless they step up their game it was a very unpleasant day.

### US Airways customer review
Online reservations and ticketing was fine. Check in fine. Philadelphia terminal a filthy unsanitary mess. Carpet strewn with trash half eaten food and beverages dirty seats burned out light bulbs. Boarding process a shambles. I paid the asking price for my ticket and purchased it long in advance of my flight. I was seated mid cabin on an aisle. There were 5 boarding groups called. How I ended up in the last Group 5 is beyond me. So I ended up stumbling over a planeload of passengers to get to my seat. Inflight I had the audacity to request a second beverage after finishing my first. I had paid for an inflight meal that was loaded with salt and needed a drink. As the flight attendant was passing through the aisle I politely asked for another beverage "whenever you get the chance I know you're busy". The reply: "It won't be any time soon. Water and coffee only". The same attendant walked past 3 times empty-handed before I asked a second attendant for the beverage. I received no reply and was really certain that I hadn't been heard. A few minutes later the drink arrived which is good and bad. Good: I got my drink. Bad: There seems to be no feeling by the attendants that passenger requests need be acknowledged. I have tired and tried with US Airways. American Airlines hasn't helped them one bit. Perhaps to the contrary. Look elsewhere for your transportation needs if at all possible.

DUB-PHL-DTW-PHL-DUB on A330-200 & Embraer 175. The aircraft were clean and seemed relatively new. All flights ran early - with the exception on the last one which had a minor 20 minute delay. The US immigration pre-clearance in Dublin was very good. The food was not great but not bad either and the same goes for the inflight service. The wine was unpalatable. IFE on the A330 was great - lots of new films. No IFE on the short flight but this is not expected. All in all - good flights and as expected. Nothing to get excited by. US Airways is not a 4 or 5 star airline but does not seem to claim to be that either. They seem to be on a par with most other North American carriers. I would fly with them again but would prefer to fly BA or Virgin if I had the option.

### US Airways customer review
I flew US Airways from Honolulu to Phoenix and the service and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The staff in Honolulu was fantastic and went out of their way to quickly and efficiently get everyone through check in and onto the flight (there was a huge line at check in). They even checked bags at no cost to help speed along the process. Once on the flight things quickly deteriorated. People were packed in like sardines and we were asked to pay for sleeping packs. With little to no room to move it was a miserable 6 hrs. Once off the flight the customer service representative was incredibly rude when I asked to be placed on a stand by flight leaving sooner to my final destination. I was forcefully educated that just because U.S. Airways and American airways have merged you cannot schedule or a adjust American flights with U.S. Overall this experience was trying given how much I spent on flights. I recommend Southwest for future flights and warn others to keep clear of flying US Airways or American Airlines.

### US Airways customer review
I cannot begin to tell you how consistently terrible this airline is. I was flying recently from Washington DC to Portland Maine. The pilot came over the loudspeaker and said we were going to set down in Philly. A light was going off that indicated that the door was not shut correctly. So we went into Philly where some of us made other arrangements others had to wait a day. A week later I was flying from Detroit back to Maine and had a 2 hour layover in Philly. I thought that this would be ample time to make my next flight but U.S. Airways missed the connection. When I went to the service counter they said it would be two days before I could get out of Philly. I went to another counter and they said it would be a day before I could get out but that I was on my own for hotel accommodations. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from US Airways.

I was travelling from Paris to Houston for business. As a last minute surprise my company offered to purchase a domestic ticket so that I could see my family in Pennsylvania which I gladly accepted. All in all I flew Paris- Charlotte Charlotte-Houston Houston-Dallas and Dallas-DC. I drove to Pennsylvania from DC. The day before my flight back to Paris I went online to check-in and noticed that I actually had to fly DC-Philly then Philly to Paris so I called US Airways to ask if I could simply check-in in Philly. They replied that this would be a $300 up-charge even though I was asking to eliminate a portion of my journey. I spoke with 3 customer service representatives and they all told me that since a direct flight was more expensive that I would need to pay more to fly less. It makes sense when booking a flight online that a direct journey would be more expensive than a non-direct one but at this point my seat was already reserved. I was told that this was 'impossible' and that if I didn't check-in in DC my whole flight would be cancelled. What I understood was that the customer service department is simply unwilling to help their guests. I will never fly with this company again.

This airline is the worst my husband and I have traveled before. He is on a business trip and since the beginning they are delaying and delaying the trips. All his flights had been delayed going in and out of Memphis. He couldn't get back today because his flight was so delayed that he lost the connection with another 12 persons. It took them 2 hours to schedule another flight for the next morning and instead of giving him his original flight to Harrisburg they sent him to Chicago to guess what delayed the flight again because they change planes for mechanical problems. They don't respect the schedules.

April 24th red eye from SAN-MSP via PHX. Little to complain about flight-wise were pretty close to being on time and no issues in-flight. Got the dreaded ZONE 5 for our boarding pass and my wife was nervous about having to gate check her carry-on (the last thing you want to do after a red eye flight is wait around at the airport for baggage) but there ended up being plenty of room.

Traveled several times over last 5 weeks with this airline. No major gripes with any flight. Most recent trip CLT to LaGuardia Flight 2064 May 1 and return Flight 1851 May 4. Delays first trip which could not be helped due to problems in NY. Captain very informative of what was happening. Friendly crew. Trip back no delays. Informative Captain and very friendly crew. Only gripe CLT check in staff need to up their game a lot. New York staff very helpful and friendly.

Flying from London Heathrow to San Diego via Philadelphia. On check in was informed of slight delay but told to go through anyway. Once through security clearance boards showed 7 hours delay on flight. I went to Customer service desk to ask what would happen about connections or overnight accommodation at Philadelphia as it seemed likely that I'd miss any connections that day. Customer service agent told me they had no idea when the flight would actually leave but that of course they'd honour the connection as it wasn't my fault and that it would all be worked out once we were airborne. She could tell me nothing because she had no information at all. So I decided to make use of the otherwise wasted time working on my PC in the executive lounge. About 2 hours later the flight disappeared from the display boards. I went back to the customer service desk to find it closed! There was a sign giving a phone number to call - which I did the person on the other end told me she couldn't book me on to any alternative flights - somehow I was too late in the queue and all available seats had already been allocated and she expected me to be pleased with the fact that she'd booked me onto the following days flight 24 hours later. No offer of overnight accommodation or transport back home overnight. When I asked about my bags she told me to ask at the ticket desk the other side of security (ie landside rather than airside). So I exited the departures area back to the check-in area only to find the customer service desk closed with a sign up saying anyone affected by the flight cancellation should call the number I'd already been talking to. On checking in again the following day there was no hint of any apology for the disruption. I asked about getting an upgrade by way of compensation and was told that was not permissible - though I could ask at the ticket desk (though by that time I had already been allocated a seat). This was the first time I had tried US Airways and looks like being my last.

### US Airways customer review
I've flown twice in the last month with US Airways and I have to say never again. Their customer service is terrible. Every flight was late. No explanation. On my most recent flight from Washington to Portland Maine I missed a connection. My layover was 2 hours long so I thought there would be no problem. But after a delay following a delay following a delay I missed my connection. The first thing the US Airways representative told me and he was a manager was that I should fly Delta. A couple of weeks earlier I was flying from Washington to Portland and we had to set down in Philadelphia because the captain told us the door wasn't shut properly. Now I know there are a lot of jobs to do before flight can take off but I think shutting the door properly should be in the top two or three on the list. The mix of arrogance in this organization baffles me.

### US Airways customer review
Connecting flight out of Charlotte supposed to take off at 10.11pm delayed until 11.30 due to no crew - get boarded only to have to defuel for over an hour. Then the mechanical problems started for another 2 hours so 3 hours sitting in the plane at the gate - only to get deboarded. It is now 3am no explanations no water no snacks. Get reboarded at 4.30am - sit for another hour - get deboarded yet again! They say they have until 10am to cancel the flight. If they don't cancel you will pay for any other flights. There aren't any flights until the day after tomorrow no hotels either. Airport/airplane for 10.5 hours past original flight time. Instead of being apologetic and nice they acted like they were doing us all a favor by letting us sit in our seats. Another US air flight was cancelled earlier in the evening due to mechanical issues as well - guess they were tired of dealing with us.

CLT-HAM. We take this trip every 2 years. I will never fly US Airways again! My story is very similar to everyone else's. They cancelled my first flight delaying our arrival by 1 day. We couldn't leave from our original location told to drive 3 hrs to Charlotte. Then they overbooked our rescheduled flight. They seated my family (children) in all different areas of the plane. They had no vegetarian options for one of us therefore she was starving on a 8 hour flight. They made an error on our return flight. Lost our luggage. Directed us to the wrong gate in PHL. When we arrived at the correct gate the attendant would not let us on the plane and she refused to help rebook our flight. We had been traveling for more than 20 hrs.

12 April 2014 Departed LHR flight no 729. Flight was 1 hour late taking off due to aircraft not being ready for passenger seating cleaning and food availability. Inflight entertainment was average seating as expected for economy class food was satisfactory but as a vegetarian I do not find it acceptable that the airline had run out of vegetarian options. I then had to wait a while for a vegetarian option to arrive. Landing was smooth arriving an hour later than scheduled meant there was not enough time to complete customs and security checks. Upon arriving at customs we were greeted by a spiralling queue of extremely anxious passengers customs were unable to manage the large quantity of passengers this resulted in us waiting for more than 1 hour no provision made for late arriving passengers to be fast tracked through customs to allow us to board our connecting flight. We were reassured that the flight would not take off without us. We ran to the gate displayed on the departures board and when we arrived at our gate we were disappointed to find that the flight had taken off without us. We waited to speak to a customer service representative for over 2 hours. We asked to be put on the next available flight and got no response was booked onto 10am flight the next morning. I asked where we would stay for the next 12 hours staff member shrugged. We walked away from customer services feeling so disappointed. We spent the night in the airport. Decided to approach customer service again totally different attitude and approach. Given a freshen up bag put us on standby for the 6am flight to Orlando. We arrived at the gate patiently and we were lucky to be boarded on this flight. Finally arrived at our destination 12 hours later. Luckily our baggage was waiting in the bag claim office. I would never fly with this airline again.

My husband and I were on our first day of our honeymoon traveling to Cancun. We boarded the flight in Charlotte NC to leave at 1.20. We sat there on the plane in separate areas from 1.20 until 3.30 waiting for the numerous "15" minutes of repairs they had to do. After finally waiting over 2 hours they started taking the luggage off without informing the attendees the flight was going to be cancelled. We waited another 15 minutes or so and they announced the flight was cancelled. We waited about 40 minutes in a long line waiting to catch another flight which they couldn't get us out until the next day in the middle of the day and we had to go back through security. So not only are we paying for a day of our all inclusive resort that we will not be at but now have to pay for food and everything. This was supposed to be the best day going on my honeymoon but it has been a nightmare.

Not only are US Airways employees rude they also are simply not willing to provide any sort of customer service and are not responsible for people missing their flights. I flew to San Juan from PHL and a return flight over PHL to NYC. My 4-year-old and I were seated 15 rows apart on a flight from PHL to San Juan and I had to wait in the aisle for 30 minutes until somebody was kind enough to let my daughter and I sit next to each other. On our flight back from San Juan to PHL the lady at the desk seated my daughter and I 5 rows apart on the connecting flight from PHL to LaGuardia. I did not realize this until 5 minutes later and went back to the same lady. Her answer - "Oh just ask one of the passengers they'll switch seats with you. The flight from San Juan to PHL was delayed because of "bad weather conditions". When we got to PHL an hour late our connecting flight to LA Guardia in NYC had already left. Another rude US Airways employee gave us tickets for a flight the next morning and as already mentioned above told us they would neither help find transportation nor a hotel. Because of their guidelines they would not release our luggage so now we are in NYC where we got at 4 am. US Airways have no customer service.

We were on our way home from San Francisco to Salt Lake City and we had a one hour layover in Phoenix. When we got to San Francisco we had already got the call that our flight was delayed 35 minutes. We tried to get on another flight but none were available. When we were checking in it was very hard to get some help because for some reason the kiosk let myself check my bag but not my friend. It took a good 10 minutes to get any help and we just kept getting walked past. Got to the gate and the plane ended up being delayed for 50 minutes now. When we got to Phoenix we had 5 minutes to get to our next flight. Turns out they changed the gate last minute and instead of only having to go from gate A10 to A12 we had to go from about A20 to B2 in 5 minutes. My friend and I sprinted from our gate to get to the next one and we arrived with one minute before they close the doors (since they close them 10 minutes before departure) The door was closed and there wasn't a sole around. I went to the next gate and I explained our flight was delayed twice and there was a last minute gate change. Very rudely she told me she was aware and then went back to talking to her friend. The customer service agent was not helpful at all as well and was very rude. No one apologized and we had to stay in Phoenix that night because no more flights were going out until 7am then next morning. I will never fly with US Airways again.

ORD-PHL-YQB (Quebec City). A320 to PHL - maybe only 45 people on the plane so boarding was quick and we departed the gate early. Flight Attendants were very personable and not what I usually get on US Airways. Maybe the merger with AA is a good thing. Drink service was offered and otherwise FA's walked the aisle a few times for trash. Landing was smooth and great views of Philadelphia. Bus transfer to commuter gates - its strange that if you want to walk to that concourse you have to recheck through TSA but they have a bus transfer that keeps you within security. YQB flight was a CR7 and packed - but FA was nice. Left 20 min late but arrived just 1-2 min late. Overall a nice flight. I know they don't offer inflight entertainment but so many people have their own Ipads and Ipods and such - its not that big of a deal. Keep up the good work.

US Airways is the worst. Their flights out of New Orleans are oversold so if you don't check in at least 30 minutes before your flight you will be bumped. I tried to get my boarding pass from the computer about 28 minutes before departure time and it could not be done. I spoke to the agent and they said that I had to rebook to another flight. I begged and they said no. They put me on a later flight and I go through security and my original flight was still at the gate for 20 minutes! They had already given away my seat and I couldn't board. Zero customer service. Horrible for business travel. I will go out of my way to avoid US Air.

I was on a trip with my 5 year old son from NY to AL. We arrived at the gate of our connecting flight in Charlotte NC just as they were closing the gate although we were there 10 min prior to takeoff. I explained that we were flying down for a funeral which we would miss if we were delayed. The gate attendant told me I was 30 seconds late and not getting on the flight. My return flight was delayed 1.5 hours and the connecting return flight sat on the runway for 45 minutes. It appears that exceptions to delay are only made when it is to benefit their company and not for their paying customers. I will never again fly US Airways!

Flew to the Dominican Republic from Detroit 4/4 with a stop in Philadelphia. First flight 40 minutes late had to literally run with 2 kids through the airport to make our connection in Philly. Didn't realize there was no need to run because that flight was delayed also. Boarded 45 minutes late sat on the plane for 30 minutes at which time they made everyone get off the plane. Sat in the waiting are for another hour while they attended to 'broken seats'. Flew home on 4/10 - flight delayed in DR for 1.5 hours with no explanation. Only had a 2 hour lay over in Philly where we also had to go through immigration and customs. Again we managed to make our connection only because the flight from Philly to Detroit was late again. That's 4 flights - all delayed. Don't you think if you have 20-30 passengers who are on the verge of missing their connecting flights that they would have those people get off the plane first? They couldn't have cared one iota. I will never fly US Air again nor would I recommend it to anyone. I can't rate the Inflight Entertainment because there wasn't any. A 4 hours flight and no entertainment of wi-fi?

Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to Honolulu Hawaii and returning from HNL to PHX. US 690 and US 693. March 24 2014 from PHX to HNL. April 1 2014 return to PHX from HNL. Having read the most recent reviews for March and April flights thought I would add mine. US Airways has been calling themselves American Airlines for many years. This time there was a 1.5 hr delay going to Hawaii due to mechanical problems. Every time I have flown with US Air there has been long delays flight cancellations you name it. Why did we fly again? They were the cheapest.

Flew US Air A330-300 from Rome (FCO) to Charlotte (CLT). Honestly I wasn't excited about having been assigned to this flight/carrier. Once on the aircraft there was a noticeable change from its US domestic counterpart there was personal AVOD at each seat head with ample choices for the long flight the seats had ample leg room and appeared wide and comfy. The flight crew were friendly and quick to please and even did a walk through picking up trash that had accumulated on the deck (rare for a US carrier). The international product that US Airways offers has left a positive impression and I won't be hesitant to fly this airline in the future. The A330-300 was spacious and smooth in flight.

Flew overnight from LAX to Philadelphia. Despite logging in on-line and assigning seats together a week or so beforehand and checking on the day of the flight my wife and I ended up at different ends of the cabin which wasn't really how we wanted to spend our honeymoon. The check-in staff were essentially useless fobbing us off onto the gate staff. At the gate they were friendly but it was too late to be able to sort anything out by that stage. Eventually we were able to swap seats with the person next to my wife after she took pity on us. The actual flight was rather miserable with no entertainment food and uncomfortable seats essentially like doing a long haul flight but on a budget European carrier. Certainly will avoid them in US Airways in the future.

### US Airways customer review
I have never experienced such rudeness as I did with the US Airways personnel at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. I had booked my redeye flight from PHX to EWR nearly 3 weeks in advance. I chose a window seat. After checking in to my flight at the airport I realized I was assigned a middle seat. Since I had arrived 4 hours before departure I was the first person at my gate. The gate agent was curt. It was almost time to board there was still no gate agent to be found. 80% of my fellow passengers myself included found out through word-of-mouth of a gate change. I grabbed my belongings and ran from A18 to A25 eager to restore my original seat assignment. However I had hardly introduced my situation before the new gate agent cut me off and said "Sorry no room. The customer service agent could not have been more indifferent and reluctant to do her job. I went back to my gate where my flight had been delayed more than 2 hours. There was yet another unannounced gate change. Finally it was time to board. Despite sitting in the 13th row I was in the last boarding group and thus was forced to gate-check my bag which now reassured that I would be late to work in the morning. This experience ruined the weekend.

Terrible service terrible equipment semi-friendly staff who can't help because of terrible organization. Baggage charges are ridiculous. Check-in procedures worse they have to have attendants at the self check-in. They claim to be the New American Airlines but when you go to check-in they send you to the Disaster that used to be USAir. Planes are out of date. Even the newer ones have very small overheads for carry ons but people take as much as possible on board. Then they cram as many possible on the plane. Flight from Hawaii has no service. Expensive food if you have to buy from them and not worth it. We had short connection and no chance to buy in airport. Only good thing I can say about round trip flight with 6 connections is we made it safely. Next time I fly Southwest.

### US Airways customer review
My wife and I live in NC near Wilmington. US Airways is one of the few airlines that fly out of ILM airport so we have flown with them numerous times. My wife flew to Ohio for a two week visit. The return flight as it was listed on the flight itinerary was to fly from Cleveland OH (CLE) to Charlotte NC (CLT) have about an hour lay over and then fly onto ILM. The flight was supposed to be into CLT on flight 1955 and out again on the same flight an hour later. This seemed odd since US Airways typically lands at one end of CLT and has you fly out of another gate all the way across the terminal. We questioned this flight into and out of the same gate when we purchased the tickets when she went to board her flight in ILM to go to CLE and again in CLE when boarding to return. All three times we were told that was accurate. The flight from CLE was delayed due to weather for 35 minutes and landed in CLT about 50 minutes late. People were scrambling to make connections as this was the last flight of the day (about 11 pm). My wife made a comment to one of the flight crew that she was lucky since she just had to stay on the same plane. The staff member told her that plane wasn't going anywhere for the rest of the night. US Airways had changed her flight plans while she was in the air. The flight she had to catch was only 8 gates away but it had already boarded and was pulling away by that time. She was stranded in CLT for the night. I ended up driving the 3.5 hours one way to pick her up to save her from having to sleep in the terminal. I would highly recommend that if you have any options other than US Airways for making flight plans you do it. Even if you have to pay a little extra for a ticket the peace of mind will be worth it.

The second leg of our outbound flight was cancelled. We were given the option of flying the next two booked flights standby or cancelling and applying for a refund. We chose to apply for a refund and the person at the customer service counter said we'd need to wait until our trip was completed. I received an email regarding our outbound flight that I needed to contact customer service because our reservations were "out of sync. I spent 25 minutes on hold getting that straightened out and the person told me I should go online and print out our boarding passes. I could only find my husband's flight. I called back and was told that was because I had new confirmation number which the prior person didn't give me. I went back online and found out we were no longer sitting together. I called back again and was told I could pay extra for a premium seat otherwise there was nothing they could do. She told me the gate agent would be “happy to help.” That conversation took an additional 30 minutes. When we got to the airport and I asked about sitting together and the employee was very rude saying she would "try to get us together for this 20 minute flight. I explained it was the second leg I was asking about. She got us closer but not together. She could have put us in a “premium”seat together but would not without us paying additional money. At no point during this entire encounter did any U.S. Airways employee apologize for these inconveniences or for the conflicting information I have been given.

Travel was a nightmare on our return vacation from Jamaica. I have a daughter with Down Syndrome and needed seating together with my wife and daughters. let's just say they were less than helpful in getting us seating together. When I pointed out that it did not seem like they were sorry about not doing their job they threatened to remove me from the plane. What kind of an airline treats a family traveling on vacation like this. This was only the first leg of the trip when it came to the second leg and catching our connecting flight they could not find our tickets and we missed our connecting flight home.

### US Airways customer review
I have flown over 20 times in my 23 years and never have I experienced any of the problems I had to deal with my first time flying with US Airways. After boarding our flight on time we proceeded to sit on the tarmac for nearly 2 hours. The pilot informed us that there were "operational" problems and they were making him turn the plane around to go back to the gate because our flight was cancelled. After the rush of everyone to customer service we proceeded to stand in line for 45 minutes. At that point one of the three agents they had behind the desk decided that would be the best time to grab her book and go on break. The agent who decided to actually do her job put us on a flight to Jacksonville (3 hours from our original destination - Tallahassee). Never once was there an apology or offer to provide meals or anything. I had checked my bag in so I made sure to reiterate to her I needed my bag re-directed. She assured me my bag had been re-directed. We proceeded to sit in the airport for another 4 hours. Our plane to JAX was late so the agent hurried all customers to the plane. Finally we got on the plane and landed in JAX at 10.15 pm. My bag was not there. After waiting in line until 11 pm to speak to an agent about I learned that my bag had never in fact been re-directed and this agent's "best guess" was that it was still in DC.

Flight from Manchester UK US735 to PHL to BWI on 16th March 2014 by Envoy and First Class service was excellent outbound. Good meal and Envoy was excellent. Return flight from BWI on 28th March cancelled and taken by vehicle to PHL 1 hour 40 mins. Flight US 735 PHL to Manchester UK. Checked in at PHL no problem and the Club lounge very nice per check in at gate confirmed our seats in Envoy. Prior to boarding saw three employees of US Airways access the plane before boarding called. When boarding announced we joined the line to check-in however told that whilst my wife was checked into Envoy I had been bumped back to coach as the flight was full as a person who missed a flight on previous day was being placed into my seat! Re assigned a coach seat despite my request to remain in Envoy. As I asked more questions the reason for my downgrade (despite confirmed and paid for Envoy seat) changed over and over again. Basically I was not provided with the correct reason and was just treated with no respect. As I was pulled from the line much embarrassment to me as people assumed some issue with me as a passenger. My wife confirmed that the three US airline employees were in Envoy. Appalling service and ruined what was outbound a great service. If this is the way they treat passengers than not much hope for the new American brand.

### US Airways customer review
We flew to St. Maarten an hour late. On the return trip the plane was late to SXM which made it late for us to board. Then the "push back" machine did not work and we were stuck on the tarmac making us an hour delayed in leaving SXM. We arrive at Charlotte and had to wait on the tarmac for an hour because there was no gate for us to deplane. The pilot told us that US Airways was holding our connecting flight. We hitched a ride on the airport transport and arrived at our connecting gate barely on time. They closed the door and would not allow us to board. Our connecting plane was not held as the pilot said but left 10 minutes before its scheduled departure. US Air offered us a discount on a hotel since there was not another flight out until the next day. We protested and refused to leave their desk. Finally they gave us a voucher for a hotel. We finally went out on a packed plane and made it to our destination. I will look for any other airline in the future for our trips.

FRA-PHL-FRA. Envoy. The new seat is excellent. Food was nicely presented and of good quality. Drinks and wine ok. Entertainment great. FA`S typical American style but they did their best. Both legs on time nothing to complain about. From my point of view a very good experience.

### US Airways customer review
We flew JetBlue to San Juan Puerto Rico - no problems or delay. Coming home through Philadelphia to Richmond VA 3/22/2014 was a disaster for several reasons. U.S. Airlines from San Juan was an Airbus 330 and we waited for 50 minutes on the runway while every puddle jumper took off which made us within 15 minutes to get our 7.15pm flight to Richmond VA. We landed in concourse F and had to get to concourse A and get a transfer bus. No help from the airline ground staff to expedite or help us. They seem oblivious to our situation and offered no help. They were rude and non caring.

### US Airways customer review
Had made reservation early January for flight to Phoenix on 2/26/14. Boarded on time but then proceeded to sit on tarmac for 2 hrs. Flight was then cancelled due to "mechanical problems". They gave us along with 175 other passengers a business card with an 800# to call. After trying for almost an hour I was finally connected and given a flight out the next day. No offer of hotel meals or anything else. I then went to customer service at airport who booked me to Philly (yes Philly). With a long layover and then to Phoenix. Arrived at 10:15pm rather than the 8:15am I was originally scheduled for. Customer services is absolutely horrible. Return flight 2 weeks later was also cancelled supposedly due to weather. No offer of help whatsoever. Will never fly US Air again.

We were flying from Jamaica to Nashville. We arrived at our connecting flight 20 prior to departure and the had given our seats away to standby customers and shut the door. We couldn't get another flight for 2 days.

### US Airways customer review
The express jets with no first class seats need to be taken out of service - these planes are entirely too small in poor shape and if anything ever happened there is no way to move to get out. US Air flight attendants (not all ) but many have the personality of a rock - they need education on customer satisfaction and customer service they need to understand that the service they provide is what matters most. And do you think they could offer a free bag of peanuts? Delta does! Get with the times US air - you are outdated.

### US Airways customer review
My entire trip was horrible. I am active duty military with both feet injured and surgery boots on. I asked for wheelchair assistance round trip. Starting in LAX the curbside check in guy was extremely rude he was on his phone and when asked for a wheelchair the man looked me up and down and asked what was wrong with me. I got through security and was wheeled to my gate the lady who wheeled me there assured me someone would push me to my airplane. When they started to board they forgot about me and had people climbing over me finally someone saw me and wheeled me half way and left me to talk to a group of passengers in front of me. Once they finished they came back and began pushing me to the airplane. Once I landed In Charlotte the flight attendant was extremely helpful getting me off the plane however once I got off the experience was even worse so many rude people asking can I walk because they need the wheelchair for people seeing I am in two medical boots. I informed them that I was unable to walk long distance so they took my wheelchair and told me to walk to the closest seat so they could take mine! This was a horrible experience and I will never travel with US Airways again.

### US Airways customer review
Firstly when will US Airways get new planes. We fly Business Class cross country with no music or entertainment of any kind. Really they can't play a little music. The seats are so old and pushed close together if the people in front recline back we can't stand up. If you're in the back row your seat doesn't recline back at all. Food is sometimes just not edible once we were sitting in the last row and were informed they had run out of food before they got to us. I asked if we could get a meal from the coach section they said no. They found some cheese and crackers for us. The crew tries to be accommodating but they don't have much to work with. All that aside it's the old planes that upset me just update the fleet please.

### US Airways customer review
MAN-PHL. The new seat is excellent - so much better than the BA sardine tin. Food was nicely presented and of good quality. Drinks free-flowing though wine selection limited. Easy going flight attendants who worked hard and interacted well with passengers. A most enjoyable experience - much better than the BA equivalent in every way and cheaper.

LGA to IAH with connection at Charlotte on March 1st. Both flights departed on-time and arrived early. Check-in boarding went very smooth and I managed to get exit seats on both flights. Cabin crew professional. Only negative point was that the cabin looked tired and not very clean. Hopefully their aircraft's will be refurbished as they merge with AA.

### US Airways customer review
My husband and I travel to Belize and Mexico 2-3 times per year with relatively little issues. I have never in my entire 42 years had such a horrible experience as I had on 21st Feb with US Airways. Our flight departed Pittsburgh at 5.25 am with no issues and we were to switch planes in Philadelphia to pick up flight #815 to complete our trip to Cancun with a 10.49 am. arrival. There was heavy fog in Philadelphia so we circled the airport for some time before being diverted to Harrisburg. Sat on the tarmac in Harrisburg for several hours with no one telling anyone anything. Around 10 am they finally taxied us to the airport and let everyone deplane. After standing in line for more than an hour a staff member told us we needed to grab our bags and get on a bus as they were going to drive us 2 hrs to Harrisburg. Arrived at the very end of the drop off zone at the Philadelphia airport at 2 pm had no idea where we were or what we were supposed to do. We managed to beg a TSA agent who hustled us through security and we ran to the gate. Got to the gate just after it pushed off so we missed the flight. An hour later we found out that not only were we not put on the next flight we couldn't even get a flight until 10 am the next day. We asked if because we missed an entire day of vacation and were out the additional cost of a hotel as well as the cost of having to reschedule all of our transportation arrangements at our final destination if we could switch our return flights from Friday to Saturday and we were told "Of course you just have to pay the change fees". Any amount of basic common courtesy would have at least made some kind of difference in this entire situation.

March 2014: My flight from Washington DC to California had a lay over in Phoenix AZ. My 9.30 pm connecting flight got delayed then cancelled due to rain. However they didn't tell us this information until a long time after it already showed up online as flight being cancelled. The rude customer service staff at the airport were rescheduling probably 150+ flights told us that there were no hotels available or lounges. They did not give us any water food (restaurants were all closed) or blankets. We sat in the cold airport all night (over 11 hours). We were not allowed to get to our luggage unless we had medication we had to take. I fly a lot but this is my first and last time flying US Airways. I have never experienced such disorganization inept and rude customer service representatives and overall horrible service.

PHX-JFK return connecting to AA international flight in JFK. Both US flights on time and exactly as expected. Both flights on time service (drink run) multiple times through each flight. Wish they would update the announcement to delete the star alliance portion as they will be exiting EOM. Also feel the onboard announcement for the credit card is tired and should be discontinued.

Booked our flight in August 2013 for Toronto to Philadelphia on Feb 15 2014 06.45. Checked our flight status the day before our flight. Everything is good but noticed 2 flights to Philly scheduled at same time. Again I checked flight status before going to bed the night before flight. Everything was good. Woke up early (2am) next morning to prepare to go to Toronto airport. Checked flight status one more time. Our flight is cancelled but other flight to is still a go. Got to airport 2.5 hours before flight time. US Airways kiosk would only printout a baggage receipt no boarding pass. Talked with US Airways rep who said the only flight to Philly was overbooked. Got stand-by boarding passes and waited at the gate for a miracle to happen. Five minutes before our flight was to board we received seats. We somehow managed to make it to our Philly connecting flight and on to our Puerto Rican cruise. If at all possible I will not fly US Airways again!

### US Airways customer review
I flew from Brussels (Belgium) to Fort Lauderdale and back on 16th Feb and 24th. I was supposed to take connecting flights via Philadelphia and Charlotte on both trips. I actually missed my first connection on my way to FLL due to the long security lines the customs control and the baggage re-checking in PHL. I arrived just a few minutes after my flight to CLT had closed and a very rude lady didn't want to let me board the plane even though it was still sitting at the gate. She directed me to the customer service desk in a rude manner. I still made it to FLL by boarding a direct flight in the evening thanks to the professional US Airways customer service lady that rebooked me straight away. I didn't have any problems with my connecting flights on my way back to Brussels. US Airways have poor cabin crew service very limited in-flight entertainment (operated by old Boeing 767s). I have read many reviews about this airline before flying with them and I was expecting to have some problems. I would not recommend this airline to someone traveling in the future.

### US Airways customer review
I recently booked a return flight from LAX to Charlotte. I paid top rate as it was an emergency. Nothing about this airlines wants you to use it again. On my return flight I paid extra to sit in an aisle seat in a designated area. I had hoped the extra $$'s would at least give more space but no such thing. At the last minute they added people from other delayed flights. They put a woman with an infant in the seat next to me and someone with an infant behind me. There were plenty of single last-minute passengers they could have put in these seats but no they put them where we all paid extra to sit. I was practically pushed out of my seat during the entire 5 hours by a fidgeting Mom and infant. Both infants cried non stop for 75% of the trip.

### US Airways customer review
LAX-PHX-PDX and return last week. All 4 flights departed and arrived relatively on-time all legs on A321 aircraft. Staff were friendly and attentive but not quite as polished as UA/DL. Star Gold gets you zone 1 boarding which is nice - but that will go away at the end of March as they leave Star Alliance and switch to oneWorld. IFE non-existent but fine for short hauls. They got me from point to point with no frills.

Yesterday morning we began our return flight to central New York from a lovely vacation in Orlando. We boarded the first leg to Philadelphia without incident around 7.30 am. As we were preparing to land a crew member announced that Philadelphia was fogged in and not allowing any craft to land or take off. After 30 minutes it was announced that the plane was being diverted to Richmond for refuelling. An uneventful 45-minute flight and then it was announced that there was some trouble refuelling. Another hour on the tarmac and we took off for Philly. Upon landing we made our way to the regional terminal to continue our trip to Ithaca which was still posted as ‘on time. The boarding was switched from gate to gate 3 times. Our departure time was changed twice and finally the flight cancelled. We stood in line at a US Airways gate and told to go to a service desk for help. We stood in line a long line for another 30 minutes at the service desk to be met by a staff member who told us that she could get us standby on a flight Monday (this was Friday at 3 pm.). The customer service representative offered nothing other than a 3 day wait. There were many things that could have been done to make the experience right. Ground transportation offer of a hotel a little compassion but what we got was nothing no help at all. We will not fly US Airways again.

### US Airways customer review
This review is based on the first and only experience with US Airways. I usually fly 4-6 times per year and would not hold the airline responsible for weather related delays. Unfortunately the airline is not prepared to handle emergencies of any kind. I was supposed to fly February 14 to Costa Rica flight was cancelled as I was proceeding to board due to "mechanical issues" rescheduled to Sunday. I lost 3 days of vacation without reimbursement. Coming back on February 23rd my connecting flight from Costa Rica was delayed by 30 minutes. The airline refused to accommodate or even hold the connecting flight. I had to go through Customs recheck the bag and run to anther terminal all under 45 minutes. I arrived at the gate 10 minutes before scheduled departure time panting only to find that my seat was given up to someone else and was I rebooked to the following morning. The Customer Service at US Airways handed me a number for the hotel very nonchalant since it was the end of her shift and she was ready to head home. I on the other hand paid for the cab checked into a hotel at my own expense. Customer service is completely lacking.

I travel a lot for work and always take Southwest. I live in AZ and usually have to fly to east coast / Midwest during bad weather and have never had an issue with delays or the staff and they give you snacks. This time I had to fly using US going to NY and the day of my flight leaving (2/21/14) the weather was warmer just a little rain and some fog. Every other flight was on time but US. A flight that was to leave at 4.30 and was now not leaving until 8. Horrible service.

I recently flew on February 15th from Boston to Providenciales (Turks and Caicos). I found this airline to be good on time boarding staff were very good. They came around with beverage service and then tea and coffee about an hour before landing in Turks. Coming back to Boston yesterday was a disaster I know it's school vacation week but the service at Providenciales Airport was extremely slow almost causing us to miss our flight to Boston. The service onboard yesterday's flight to Boston was minimal. They only came around with beverage service once. No service for tea and coffee. It was though a quick flight and the pilot made up travel time in the air after our brief 1 hour delay leaving Turks and Caicos.

I flew US Airways on a round-trip from Birmingham to Denver. Both flights were cancelled or delayed for several hours.

We flew from PHL to St. Thomas and back on US Air on Feb 15 and returned on Feb 20. We paid extra for what we thought was economy plus but there was no more leg room than in coach. Of course US Air has no inflight entertainment. There was not enough food for purchase on the way down. Flight attendants urged us to complain to US Air on the net about it. Flight attendants were great and very apologetic about the lack of food. On the return flight we were about 3 hours late due to a mechanical problem. I fly United Delta Virgin America Jet Blue and US Air a decent amount. No question that Virgin is by far the best followed by JetBlue. Of the remaining 3 Delta is better than the other two with US Air on the very bottom of the list.

BTV to PHL to CDG and return Airbus A330/200 on the long haul. Despite snowstorm at BTV departure was only 25 minute delayed remainder of flights on time departed CDG earlier than scheduled. Business class on the A330 Envoy seating. Clean cabin friendly professional crew. Envoy suites were excellent quiet and comfortable IFE worked great. Food service was excellent nice menu entrees were delivered almost too hot to eat. Ground crews at both ends were friendly and helpful our luggage beat us to the carousel both times. Boarding area at CDG is a little drab could use a little facelift.

Flew Manchester UK to Philadelphia and then on to Miami return - Economy. Very good experience on all 4 flights. All flights left on time and either arrived on time or early. US Airways use A330 wide body from Manchester to Philadelphia with 2-4-2 seating which is great for couples as you can easily get 2 seats together. US airways website lets you choose your seats as soon as you book for free unlike lots of the other major airlines (e.g. BA) which charge economy class to pre book seats. Plenty of leg room and space around seats. Great inflight entertainment on Manchester to Philadelphia leg with personal video screen and on demand movies TV and games. Lots of films to choose from. Food ok - usual airline offering. No better or worse than all the rest. Soft drinks tea and coffee are free throughout the flight. Free wine with meal but there is a charge after that plus there is a charge for other alcoholic drinks. Staff attentive and efficient. Flight from Philadelphia to Miami on A321 - lots of leg room but no IFE - only a couple of hours so no problem. No charge for soft drinks/tea/coffee but there is a charge for food or alcohol. All in all a good experience - would always use US airways from Manchester to the US rather than American BA United or Delta as IFE superior and they use wide body aircraft. Immigration/customs and change of planes in Philadelphia is easy and quick.

We were booked from LAX to CLT. Flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. We were rebooked out of a different airport. No transportation costs were provided or refunded. We had preferred seats on our first flight reserved and confirmed but then when rebooked we were assigned middle seats. Even though there were other seats available US Airways refused to give us other seats even with Star Gold. status. Inflight crew were yelling at passengers getting on board about the carry ons we were questioned from FA about our carry ons even though we only had 1 backpack each. One drink service on a 4 hours flight. Flight crew decided to chat loudly in the back galley on this red eye flight. I hope that American Airlines doesn't adopt the US Airways policy of "useless" air.

As an EP with American flew US Airways from TPA to PHL on 1/10/2014. The seats are terrible American offers free food and drinks to their Elite Passengers but US Airways does not. As an EP with American for 10 years this is one of the worst airline that American merged with. US /American CEO Doug Parker needs to take care of AA Elite Passengers or they will fly United or Delta.

Flew from Providence to Charlotte. Going in I was very optimistic that everything was going to be fine and we would land in St. Kitts the same day. I was wrong. When we got to the gate we were kindly informed that our flight had been delayed 4 hours because the "crew needed more rest. They also informed us that we were going to miss our connecting flight to St Kitts from Charlotte and that we wouldn't be able to catch a flight until next Friday to St. Kitts as they have very limited booking. After switching to another airline entirely we got a flight to St. Kitts the next day and we were on our way. Once on the U.S. Airways flight to Charlotte the captain informed us that they "knew the flight would be delayed the night before. If U.S. Airways had informed us the night before instead of a half an hour before our flight was supposed to leave then we might've been able to get another flight to connect to the flight to St. Kitts. This has been by far the worst performance of customer experience I've ever seen.

Had a flight out of JFK during a snow storm. Our flight was canceled after waiting through 3 different mechanical issues and 11 hours. We boarded the same plane 2 separate times over 8 hours and were offered 1 glass of water. My trip home was delayed 24 hours with no hotel voucher given causing me to miss a day of work. US Airways offered $100 voucher for my troubles! I would have been ok with a weather delay considering the snow storm but mechanical? 3 on the same plane? Then continued mechanical delays on three other planes through connecting flights.

Unpleasantly surprised by the rushed unfriendly service in first cabin to Europe. there weren't that many flight attendants (mostly men) and they were all in a hurry and don't seem to like their jobs much. The new lie-flat bed was great though small - bigger folks beware. Fook was OK. was glad I didn't bother to spring for biz class on way back. Economy is OK.

Was traveling from DC to Hartford on 1/24/14. Flight to DC was coming from Jacksonville FLA - no weather problems in either JAX/DC/CT. The DC departure to CT was over 2 hours late. To make matters worse the plane from DC to Hartford bumped anyone off sitting in rows 19 and beyond. Imagine waiting to board a plane and then due to your seat # - told you couldn't board but that there was another flight 6 hours later!

We used a travel agency to book our flight Fresno to Mexico City. Our seating was confirmed we paid extra for selecting our seats. At check-in we were told that we would be charged $25 for using a 27 inch suitcase instead of a 21 inch suitcase. Then they wanted to charge us another $95 for being 6 pounds over in weight. We had to run and buy a backpack for the items we took out. Then asked to see our passports and told our return flight was changed from the afternoon to early morning and we: my husband and 2 daughters were scattered all over the plane. I was told they could change the seating in Mexico on our return flight. In Mexico City on our return home to Fresno CA arrived at the airport asked about changing back our seating to the original seating arrangement everyone said they could not help me. They only changed my seating to sit next to my husband. When they rescheduled our flight our arrival time in Phoenix was at 11am and or boarding time to Fresno was at 11.20 am. and when I voiced this concern all I was told was that we had better run.

Took my twin 6 year olds and 2 year old to Disney from Boston with a stop in Charlotte NC. We were delayed by a late plane that then had to be de-iced. An hour and 1/2 after our scheduled departure I asked a crew member for some milk for my baby's bottle. The elder of the 2 grouchy crew members said we don't have milk! The 2 year old screamed for most of the flight. We had a connecting flight in Charlotte due to leave 5 mins before our new arrival time. No information was given to anyone. We finally get to our new gate (B8 Charlotte about 7pm on 1/18/14). We were treated like misbehaved school children. They put us in 4 seats that were spread across the plane. I was met with a glare and an attitude. Onboard was not much better. Service and attitude poor across the board with this airline.

We took US Airways flights earlier this month ORD-CLT-ILM round trip. Pretty happy with them. Short flights…but check-in was a pleasure (we got stuck overnight Chicago due to a late connecting flight and bad weather and US airways gave us a voucher for a very reduced rate at a local hotel and re-scheduled us for the next day - no charge. Check-in staff at ORD and ILM excellent particularly ORD where they spent a lot of time trying to find alternatives for us no luck - terrible weather and flights beyond full. Aircraft's have done some hard work but still pretty comfortable - leather seats enough legroom. Cabin crews were helpful and friendly - regardless of age.

January 15 2014. Flew from Palm Springs to Portland with connection in Phoenix. Connection was "legal" with 28 minutes from first flight touchdown to door closure on connecting flight. Of course the flight in was in a separate terminal so the time to get from one gate to the other was a 30 minute ordeal. Needless to say of the 4 passengers that were to connect none made it. When I arrived at the connecting gate after running across the entire Phoenix airport I was greeted by a very non caring gate crew. They immediately asked me if I was connecting from Palm Springs and when I said yes the gate rep just said that the flight was closed and I have to take another flight. I asked if they knew we were coming in from Palm Springs and they knew the plane had landed and they knew we were all coming from about a mile away then why on earth would they not hold the door an extra ten minutes. This is their scheduling screw-up not mine. The lack of apology and talking to us as if the whole thing was somehow our fault just puts a bad taste in my mouth.

### US Airways customer review
We sat on the tarmac for an hour got into the air only to be told there was a mechanical error. Flew in circles around the airport for 4.5 hours (longer than my actual flight) to burn off fuel were treated rudely by staff and no beverages were offered the entire time. Our rescheduled flight was for 7.30 am the next morning and when we arrived it said it was on time for 8.45am. When I asked they said that even though it was late it wasn't really their fault so even though it was over an hour late it was still considered on time. They then double booked my grandfathers seat and tried to move him out of first class. On our way back we sat in line for 3.5 hours to check in because the system had crashed and the flight was delayed 2 hours just so that they could check everyone in which meant I almost missed my connecting flight. I am currently waiting on my bags the next day. I am never flying US airways again.

LHR to Philadelphia. Good catering. Very full flight. Pleasant cabin crew. Touchscreen was a bit unresponsive at times but all in all not bad for 8 hour economy flight. Unfortunately ended up with a middle seat.

### US Airways customer review
We flew from Philadelphia to Dominican Republic round trip. Overall it was a good experience though the airline needs to do a lot to improve their inflight service.

I flew from Denver to Charlotte to get a connecting flight to Jacksonville NC. The Denver flight was delayed 1.5 hrs due to maintenance therefore I missed my connecting flight they rebooked me for another flight but I had to stay the night in Charlotte but gave me a hotel voucher for a booked hotel. The flight from Charlotte to Jacksonville was also delayed due to maintenance. Moral of the story US Airways has horrible planes that always need maintenance. Don't fly with them unless you want to be late or miss every connecting flight.

I recently flew U.S. Airways from Denver to Boston MA. Although I had to change my flight from one day to the next and pay an extra fee for the change the flight was very comfortable. After I arrived in Boston I knew that my bags were MIA. I had recently flown from San Francisco to Denver and they sent my bags to Washington D.C. even though I never made that flight but since I was scheduled to be in Boston I had to travel knowing I didn't have my bags. I was very pleased with Susan at customer service in Boston. As I arrived she promptly assisted me in locating my bags. She was also extremely pleasant to me as a customer. Needless to say because of her my bags were returned and I will definitely be flying U.S. again!

This has to be the worst airline I have flown on and I do travel a lot. Our recent supposedly first class flight from PVR to YVR started late in PVR due to technical difficulties. A two hour 10 minute flight in first ranks a cardboard cup of coffee and a bag of potato chips! The second leg was delayed due to technical problems then when ready to leave a drunken passenger had to be removed on the insistence of a passenger (the attendant said he knew he was drunk but not how much) and then the plane developed a mechanical problem necessitating a plane change. 4 hours late and what did first class passengers get for their now 7 plus hour trip-yes you guessed it a bag of chips and a drink. They should be banned from Star Alliance Membership until a new experienced in customer service CEO is hired. Clearly this is the fault of the Executive not the cabin crew. By the way no inflight entertainment and the seat in front of me was broken.

### US Airways customer review
I flew in November 2013. Rarely have I experienced such stressed out miserable flight attendants. Their unhappiness changed the tenor of the entire trip. There were no unusual conditions with the trip. We had a packed flight but we weren't running late and passengers weren't making any special demands or causing problems. The attendants' facial expressions body language and polite curtness spoke of barely held in tension. In addition to that passengers were herded onto the plane managed like we were an inconvenience (again politely but still the feeling was there) and the plane itself was dirty. While US Airways is offering some good flight deals I don't feel inclined to fly an airline where the staff are clearly not happy with their jobs. Additionally US Airways needs to beef up their efforts to provide a great experience for their customers.

### US Airways customer review
Multiple frustration with seating arrangements we (fiancé and I) purchased our ticket a month in advance and were later told that we would be together. Found or seating arrangement a week before the flight and seated separately. No customer service would help. When boarding I was holding my tablet in hand my back pack and wheeled baggage. They got on my case about my tablet that I was only allowed a carry on and personal bag. Told I would need to put my tablet in the bag. Or check in one of my bags. They were dead serious that they wanted me to step aside and put my tablet in my carry on or else have to check-in my bag. Seats were cramped and I'm a slightly small framed individual.

### US Airways customer review
Traveled from Long Beach to Phoenix and then onward to JFK Airport on red-eye flight. This flight left much to be desired as everything from the hard to soft product are abysmal. Domestic first seats are unbearably uncomfortable to sleep in with the angle recline only going down about 3-5 inches. As for the on board amenities free alcohol and few select chips just doesn't cut it though they do offer meals on non red-eye flights from what I've been told. It gets even better as the sad excuse of a blanket they provided for sleep was a thin fabric that can easily be mistaken for as a table cloth. Club access in Phoenix was granted with *G and much like the flight it left a lot to be desired as well - stale crackers unappealing soup and choices of free and paid drinks. Positive to flight was that staff service is fair and ground handling was par. As a star alliance traveler I really wished there was a better alternative to traveling domestic US.

I flew from Italy to Pittsburgh (via Philadelphia) on Nov 14 2013 with return on Dec 28 2013 via Philadelphia and Frankfurt. On my return flight to Frankfurt (A330 plane with IFE at seat) I felt very dizzy and was about to pass out halfway into the flight. The flight attendants in Economy promptly assisted me and checked on me every 10 minutes to see how I was feeling. Their attentiveness and concern were much appreciated especially as I was traveling alone. What's more the US Airways staff in every airport (Venice Philadelphia Pittsburgh and Frankfurt) were courteous and professional. I have absolutely no complaints with this airline and will fly with them again.

### US Airways customer review
We flew from Denver - Phoenix - Puerto Vallarta on 12/25/13. Denver to Phoenix was ok. In Phoenix the female gate attendant was very rude stating we must check our carry on bags. On board several open spaces in overheads. Puerto Vallarta-Phoenix flight was ok. Phoenix-Denver flight was the same rude female supervisor again had to check carryon bag. FA's are rude and act like they are along just for the ride. This is the first and last experience with this airline.

### US Airways customer review
Flew on 12/24/13 from SYR to PHL to GSP - worst experience due to USAir's inability to publish a flight schedule with connections that could be met and PHL HUB employees not having enough knowledge of alternative airports and airlines. Additionally all personnel I spoke with at PHL or on the phone looking for assistance were very very rude.

### US Airways customer review
I flew from Guadalajara to Phoenix then to San Jose (GDL-PHX-SJC). In Guadalajara boarding was on-time and take off also on-time. We arrived to PHX at the scheduled time but we only had 1 hour to catch the next flight to SJC we lost it because immigration queues were too congested. The staff of US Airways was perfect they re-booked the tickets and we had to wait 4 more hours in the airport. When we were finally onboard the next plane (both Airbus A320) we had to wait 40 more minutes. Arrive at SJC 1 hour delayed.

### US Airways customer review
PHL-SJU-PHL. Although I generally have a negative image of this airline I must give credit where credit is due. Both flights were on newer A330's with very polite and attentive FA's and both flights departed and landed on time despite snowy conditions in Philadelphia . The one complaint I have is that the IFE was not turned as this is only provided on transatlantic flights - how much exactly does it cost US Airways to turn on a system they already have installed in the aircraft?

### US Airways customer review
Flew Fresno - Phoenix - Orlando 3 day trip. Last month flew Fresno - Phoenix - Charlotte. Last trip was a nightmare because of delays - mechanical resulting in missed flights and a flight crew on the last leg that seemed to not be too concerned with the delay given it was late at night. Anyway booked again. This time first class. Good experience. First leg out operated by Sky West. Flight attendants - two of them talking loudly all the time. Were attentive to passenger needs. Hopefully will be more sensitive given that some of us had been up since 4 am to get ready for the flight. Rest of the trip was great. Bottom line flight crew is key to a positive experience. Will fly US Air again.

### US Airways customer review
DFW to LGA via CLT. All flights went smoothly. I was a little nervous since we left Dallas 30 minutes late and had only 20 minutes for the connecting flight to LGA. However flight to LGA boarded passengers from the same terminal that we arrived from which was very convenient (arrival and departure gate was right next to each other) My luggage also made it despite short connection time in Charlotte. I kept tracking my bag by using their iPhone application as well as the flight status while in the air. Crew members were extremely polite and offered more than one round of soft drinks and coffee. My only criticism would be their boarding policy. I was group 2 on the first flight but group 5 on the final flight even though I was sitting in the front section of the cabin. I received Star Alliance partner miles within 5 days into my account.

### US Airways customer review
I feel that there is simply no excuse travel on a transcontinental flight and be served no meals except the horrible choice that you are given and have to buy. Airlines should be required to serve at least one meal without charge when you are flying all of the way across the USA! On the way back on the last leg of my journey back home to Newport News Virginia we were not even served water!

### US Airways customer review
I've been flying US Airways for nearly 3 months. Four flights per week for a total of 48. Nearly half of them have been delayed due to some sort of mechanical issue. These issues always take much longer than the expected amount of time to the point that I have missed 10 connections in that period. Two weeks ago I flew IAH to CLT to see my flight to SAV was delayed by 30 minutes then 1 hour then cancelled without explanation. Customer service offered a flight at 9 pm 12 hours later. In fact I'm currently on board a flight to CLT that cannot depart because the plane has had ice for an hour and a half. Rather than moving to have the plane de-iced at the north end of the airport they attempted to fix it with a heating truck then a second one. The crew has been unsympathetic throughout and I'm frankly tired of it. Unfortunately I'm not in charge of booking my business flights. But for those that have the option I would suggest avoiding US Airways if you intend to ever arrive on time.

### US Airways customer review
When I checked in I checked with the agent to make sure that the plane was not delayed and that I would not be running in to weather issues. She assured me that it would not be a problem because of my flight time. So I made no arrangements to rebook anything. That quickly turned out to be a lie. We started with a delayed flight out of DFW 1.5 hours delayed while we waited on the plane to be de-iced. We finally arrive with passengers that had connections to Richmond and Denver. Due to the delay our planed landed 5-10 minutes too late to make the connection. Both planes were still at the gates. But instead of holding the planes by 5-10 minutes which by the way would not have caused any disruption of service because all of the planes that had connections were the last flights of the day. Instead a conscious decision was made to deliberately force all of the passengers to miss their planes and have to incur hotel food and transportation expenses. I was one of the first passengers to be turned away. The gate agent was still at the gate the plane was still at the gate but she said they had shut the door and I was stuck for the night. I then got in line and was stuck on the next flight and sent on my way. The next day I get to the gate. It is a full flight and everyone in group 4 and 5 are told they can only have 1 bag or personal item. I checked with the agent and made sure that it was okay for me to have my laptop bag and my shopping bag. Then at the gate I was told that I could not take my laptop bag. Instead I had to take both of my laptops out check my laptop bag and then crush my designed hand bag and pastries by cramming them under the seat with my unprotected laptops. It seemed like every step of the way every agent of USAir intentionally tried to make this the worst possible trip possible.

### US Airways customer review
I purchased two round trip tickets on USAirways for travel from DC to Orlando FL for the Thanksgiving holiday. We were unable to use the ticket for flight from DC to Orlando and U SAirways canceled our return tickets from Orlando to DC. I found this out when I tried to check in online for the return flight. We had to rent a car and drive from Orlando to DC because our tickets had been canceled.

Booked my flight AND free seat selection (8E) on 6/9 for my flight to PHL on the 15/11/13. At check in they gave me seat 24 which was the worst though 8E had been confirmed by US Air. They said that they have no obligation to provide the confirmed seat of my choice! Strongly complained to supervisor via phone and asked for aisle seat for my return flight on the 8/12/2013. He said plane was almost full and the best he could do was give me an aisle seat row again 24. Plane was 1/3 full practically empty and at PHL airport I was given row 12. Inflight service both ways far below average no comments on food. This airline in no way can compare with European airlines and this was my fourth disappointing experience with this company.

### US Airways customer review
I flew from Honolulu to PHX and PHX back to Honolulu. I was very disappointed with this airline my first impression was horrible. Going to PHX from HNL the flight attendants on US airways were very rude and unprofessional. The aircraft that services HNL is always the 757. It was very squashed no wifi 3 by 3 seating configuration on the left and right side thus no room to move around. The interior of the plane was falling apart tray tables did not at all stay in the lock position. Lighting everything seemed out dated. Meal service was horrible you have to pay for meals where as on Hawaiian Airlines all meals are complimentary. Coming back from PHX to HNL flight attendant and customer service was very outstandingly rude. We were delayed 1 hour because we had to wait on a US air flight attendant who was late. This is unacceptable.

### US Airways customer review
My son had a very expensive round-trip ticket for Thanksgiving break: Spokane to Los Angeles with transfers in Phoenix. We confirmed the flights online. We tried to check in at the airport on Dec 1 for the return flight at least 30 min early (6am). My son had only one carry-on and a backpack. Theoretically he could use the automatic kiosk to get his boarding pass and go directly through security. They had already sold his ticket. The woman behind the counter wasted our time. It took 10 more minutes to call the supervisor. They were rude and told us we should have been there 45 min early. They gave my son a standby ticket for flights when the Phoenix transfer was at 9pm with no chance of getting aboard. That would mean he would be sitting at the airport from 6am to 9pm! I had to pay a change of flight fee $225 plus $250 for the next day.

### US Airways customer review
My two young kids and I flew US Airways over the thanksgiving holiday. All four of our flights were on time and the connections were all within the same terminal which was a plus. The staff were friendly on every flight as well. On our last flight the airplane didn't have enough seats due to a smaller airplane than expected so all the passengers in the last ten rows had to be put on different flights. It was obviously an inconvenience but they did a phenomenal job handling it. They immediately put us on another flight that was leaving at the exact same time got an airport cart to take us to our new terminal gave us each $200 vouchers and delivered our luggage to our home. They were so kind and apologetic what more can anyone ask for!

### US Airways customer review
Our flight from Flagstaff to Phoenix was canceled due to fog and our second leg was rescheduled for 12 hours later without ever getting in touch with me to have my permission for this move. I drove to Phoenix to catch my second flight and got there on time but was not able to get on that flight because they already gave away my tickets. Mind you economy class over $2.5k for 2 tickets and then you get pushed around whichever way! I wonder whether you just turned around and ripped someone off to sell my tickets and then reschedule me for an overnight trip! Not to mention that the rest of the service was not that hot either. The person on the phone was not so polite or helpful in addition. Really a huge disappointment US Airways!

### US Airways customer review
On Columbus Day Weekend from MYR to LGA through CLT the first flight was scheduled to leave at 2.23 then from CLT to LGA at 4.30. When I got to the airport at Myrtle the lady at the counter told me my flight was not leaving until 4.50 because of a "mechanical error. I received no notification or email. She put me on a 10 pm flight to LGA without my consent. This is absolutely unacceptable for an airline. She refused to tell me that there were earlier flights available so I looked myself and found a flight on Delta which left 3 hours earlier. The staff at US Airways are so unsympathetic and simply do not care about the customers. I recommend flying any other airline unless US airways is your only option. The flight attendants refused to apologize for this too. Never again on this airline.

### US Airways customer review
I started flying with US Airways a few years ago when they offered competitive business class (envoy) fares from Ireland and received a Dividend Miles Gold Card from them two years ago. On 9th November 2013 I flew first class on an internal flight from Tampa to Charlotte. I had to pay $50 to spend one hour in the US Airways Club in Tampa airport a lounge that does not offer a shower facility. The fact that I was flying first class and holding a US Airways Dividend Miles gold card was irrelevant to the staff at the reception desk there. I will never fly with US Airways again.

### US Airways customer review
We flew with one-stop from Boston to Phoenix and then Phoenix to Maui Hawaii. Each leg of the trip was about 6 hours so we splurged for 1st Class assuming it would be more comfortable and have full amenities one would expect at $1300 per seat (one way). Pulled out my headphones but found nowhere on the seat to plug into? Was told there were no music TV movies or other entertainment options. Wi-Fi was offered at a price but it still would not allow for any streaming services so what's the point? Staff were polite and matter of fact. Meal was mediocre even for airline food. No complaint with the beverage service they realize it's the best way to medicate you. We eventually had 3 each and fell asleep. We had about 40 minutes between flights and they didn't announce the gates for connecting flights at the end of the flight as many airlines do for their passenger's convenience. On the ground in Phoenix we learned that the gate for our second flight to Maui was clear on the other side of the airport so we hurried with our carry-ons to the far end some 30 gates away. As soon as we got there they announced a gate change that flight which required us to rush right back across the entire airport again to the gate area where we had started at!! Everyone already at the gate bolted for the far end of the airport along with us. Insane. Even Jet Blue economy is a better flight experience. We will never use this airline again.

Nov 21 MOB-CLT-ORD. CR7 from Mobile to Charlotte. Flight boarded on time and left 15 minutes early. Flight attendant was nice and let everyone sleep as it was a 6am flight. Landed on time and long walk from Concourse E to B for connecting flight. A321 to ORD - boarded and flight attendant at the door had her back to the door so wasn't greeting anyone. Then the next FA as you walked into the coach cabin was on here cell phone and either ignored the passengers coming in or waved them a "hello". Totally unprofessional and rude. Flight was packed but left on time. Smooth flight and comfortable seats - limited service from FA's. Really will be interesting to see what happens with the merger with AA.

### US Airways customer review
I experienced delays inbound and outbound. In cabin satisfaction is dependent on the crew. Flight back to SFO captain reported 2 tyres needed to be changed. Should be done in 15 mins comes back with 20 min extensions for total delay of 60-90 mins. No inflight beverage service. Never experienced this on other flights. Good for the crew they got to sit out. Delayed arrival because of mechanical issue. Flown many times. I would describe myself as a non complainer on flights so far as I have accepted the decline in service in general.

### US Airways customer review
Manchester UK to Fort Lauderdale via Philadelphia. Trans Atlantic in Envoy A332. Great seats and meal was excellent. The service is not to BA or Virgin standards but was never the less very good. Lounge stop over at Philadelphia was very good and economy trip to FLL on an airbus A321 nice flight with good seats. Return FLL to PHL on an Embraer 195 first time on this plane and very good experience 2 plus 2 seating in economy. Club Lounge at PHL was an excellent oasis although not a patch on BA or Virgin lounges. A332 in Envoy for trip back to UK was great again although staff on this flight not as good and the food served was lukewarm and attention to detail was lacking bread offered after you had eaten the main course! Breakfast omelette and sausage was good. Overall a great Enoy experience once again I do hope that Envoy brand is retained when the AA/ US merger is complete otherwise I will miss the US Airways experience as I can honestly say I have never had a bad flight with them and I have had quite a few.

### US Airways customer review
LGA-CLT-SDF-CLT-LGA with the CLT-SDF segments operated by express carriers. I was worried about the short transit times and the vast CLT RJ complex but it more or less worked out. Departure from SDF-CLT was on a day with miserable weather but US made it out and I made the connection with maybe 1-2 minutes to spare. The LGA terminal is really a pleasure to use with short lines and a nice amount of space near the gates. Staff service was good throughout. Only problem is the lack of BOB even on the mainline flights - just offering nuts and chips is not enough during lunch time and with short connections there's not really any other choice!

### US Airways customer review
Flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia with a connection to Florida. Flights were on time the planes (A330 and A321) were clean modern and the staff on board and on ground were welcoming. The food on board was actually really good! The on-board entertainment was very good other than the touch screen wasn't very responsive but no big deal! Having read reviews I was quite apprehensive about travelling with US Airways and honestly I couldn't fault them. Pleasant flight lots of stewardesses offering drinks food etc. Would gladly use them again.

### US Airways customer review
I was in 1C on a US Airways A321. The flight was a little over 5 hours which was too long to be sitting in this seat. The seat was worn out and reclined about as much as coach. And seat 1d was completely broken. The meal was average and the service was poor. I would never pay for these seats and would only sit in them if I got a preferred upgrade.

### US Airways customer review
Having logged hundreds of thousands of miles world-wide I would rank my recent experience with U.S. Airways be in the top two of my worst travel experiences. Oakland - Phoenix - New York - Phoenix - Oakland. Eastbound Oakland and westbound New York flights were both late departing (the latter by more than one hour). Nearly missed my eastbound Phoenix connection and actually did miss my westbound connecting Phoenix flight due to late departure from NYC. My Westbound flight took nearly 11 hours from NYC to Oakland. I could have flown to Europe in that amount of time (less actually). Promised meal eastbound was not provided after all. Dinner consisted of a bag of pretzels. Bad news overall.

### US Airways customer review
MIA-PHLin business class: the seats were nice and spacious however didn't seem particularly clean. The service was OK but nothing special almost surly. PHL-VCE in business class: we had to wait to be airborne before the inflight entertainment was switched the headphones and the TV screens installed in the individual cradles. Once that was done the selection was rather limited. The service was OK the attendants did what they had to do but there was no enthusiasm in what they were doing overall above all considering that the plane was half empty in both classes. The food was actually tasty and well presented. The seats a bit temperamental to begin with and then not too comfortable: they didn't flat out completely so not too conducive to sleeping. The lounge in PHL was nice but the food selection there was extremely limited surely if compared to other StarAlliance lounges around the world.

I flew from Newport News Virginia to L.A. with a connecting flight in Charlotte. The plane left Newport News about half an hour late and so it looked like I would miss my connecting flight. But I ran all the way from gate E to B9. I arrived at the gate to see that the plane was still taxied and attached to that little bridge walkway to board the plane. It looked like I made it but when I tried to give my boarding pass to the lady she very coldly told me I was too late. I tried to plead my case in a calm and rational way but was told that the next flight was in an hour. It was actually in 2 hours and when I called her out on it she just smirked.

### US Airways customer review
Been flying US Airways for a couple years now and have had nothing but the best of experiences. I base my review by comparing it to my experiences with other airlines - they are in my opinion the most organized airline. My goal when flying is to get from point A to point B and be somewhat on time. With US Airways my flights have always been as scheduled. Seats are a bit more spacious than with other airlines too. I could not care less if the staff had a smile on their faces or not. Maybe they are like us and are having a bad day every now and again.

LHR-CLT-CMH-PHL-LHR. Transatlantic legs in Envoy Suites domestic in First. Was really very pleasantly surprised with the whole trip. The Envoy suites are very comfortable fully flat and private (particularly if you get the individual window seats) and are in fact very similar to AAs new business class flat beds on their new B777-300s or Qatars B787. However the US Airways seats are clearly a more budget version with smaller TV screens etc (but just as comfy for sleeping). Reasonable selection of films and the food was not bad at all. Excellent value- Booked less than a week before departure and this was the same price (slightly less in fact) as a full price Premium Economy fair on BA so absolutely no competition and would choose again without hesitation.

October 29th Boston to Charlotte flight 657. Do you have any idea how rude the "customer service" representatives are in Charlotte? I have had two separate experiences with them in the past couple of months and I am just dumbfounded by it. We approached the Customer service desk where 3 employees were virtually filing their nails. They didn't say hello they didn't smile. They weren't helpful. It was almost like they were aggravated to have to deal with us.

### US Airways customer review
I have been flying for over 50 years and I can honestly say that my recent round trip flight on US Airways from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv was the worst airline experience I have ever had. The first leg of this trip was from Los Angeles to Philadelphia when I got on the plane I looked around to plug in my earphones to hear some music but the stewardess informed me that this flight did not have any way to either listen to music or watch a video. In addition all food had to be purchased. The second leg of the trip was a 12 hour flight from Philadelphia to Tel Aviv. The TV screen on the back of the seat in front of me did not work and when I told the steward he attempted to fix it but he was unsuccessful consequently I sat in a cramped seat for over 12 hours with no music or video. When they served breakfast there were two choices: eggs or blintzes - I asked for eggs but I was told that they were out of eggs and when I asked the steward to check the other aisle to see if there were any eggs left he became angry. Unfortunately the blintzes were covered with a sickeningly sweet jam which made them inedible. I will never fly US Airways again.

### US Airways customer review
Flew BNA-CLT-PVD. Overall I had good flights and didn't really experience any problems myself but the airplanes themselves are old and you can tell in the interior. Gogo wireless was a nice touch but it wasn't always reliable and was also a bit pricey - $17 for a day pass? The fact that they overbook bothers me. I saw families get bumped in CLT and didn't think that was a good business practice; only giving folks a $300 voucher for it isn't really helping their case though I suppose it's better than no voucher.

### US Airways customer review
We will never fly US Airways again after this experience. The first three legs of our journey were OK - average service but on-time arrivals but the last leg was a nightmare. Our flight was cancelled after a 4-hour delay and while cancellations happen to all airlines the way US Airways handled this one was appalling. Gate agents could not operate their own ticketing system to rebook passengers baggage was delivered two hours late and to a carousel in a different terminal and US Airways employees had no idea what was going on and were generally indifferent to passenger needs. We were traveling with an infant yet were given a hotel 15 minutes away when there was another hotel connected to the airport that other families received. Overall just a complete disaster in terms of customer service.

PHL-PBI was the last leg on my first-class round trip to and from PSP. I had boarded USAir in Palm Springs that morning and flew to Phoenix. So far so good. Then I flew Phoenix to Philadelphia. That's where it all fell apart. I was stranded at Philadelphia airport by US Airways when their last flight of the day departed early leaving 3 connecting passengers abandoned. Dealing with the brick wall that is the US Airways customer service staff my treatment was shameful disrespectful and costly. USAir refused to rebook me because my reservation had been made via United Airlines. United told me that since my reservation was a First Class Mileage Award the first compatible seat they could rebook me on was next Monday (5 days hence)! Consequently I had to put myself up at the Sheraton in Philadelphia for the night and pay $508 to buy a one-way ticket from PHL-PBI. Adding insult to expensive injury the flight I was supposed to take was first-class non-stop. This one-way rip-off ticket was in coach and had a layover in Charlotte. On just this website alone and going back only about 8 weeks I have encountered reviews of no less than a dozen passengers who have been stranded or treated miserably in Philadelphia by USAir. Coincidence? I don't think so. It is my belief that when an airline accepts your ticket to get from point A to point B that it assumes its share of responsibility for getting their passengers to their destination. I had already flown 2 out of the 3 legs of my flight that day. Departing early and stranding three connecting passengers is unconscionable.

Flew from PHL to DEN round trip Oct. 17 returning Oct. 20. Upgraded on the flight to Denver and coach returning to Philadelphia. Both flights were on time and just as importantly the cabin crew were professional and overall did a good job. On the flight to PHL there was a medical emergency and the crew kept the passengers informed - as much as they could - regarding what was going on. Overall good experience. People complain there's no IFE on US. Bring a book or your tablet to watch a movie.

My 92-year-old father flew from Denver to Asheville NC and when we got to Denver there was a guy at the ticket counter who helped my dad with his ticket luggage and wheelchair. He could not have been nicer or more helpful. The lady who came with the wheelchair was a nice and patient as she could be with him. He reported later that all personnel with US Airways were very attentive and helpful in getting him through the airport. They may have been bad in the past but this time they were the best airline I've seen.

### US Airways customer review
We flew GLA-PHL on time with good service then the PHL-MCO connection was delayed due to a crew member being late 30-45mins delay. After a wonderful holiday in Orlando checked in at 11.30 in good time for our 3.05 flight to PHL then went through security and to the gate departure screens said our flight would be delayed to 4.20 so it would not arrive in PHL until 18.20. Told we would miss our connection to GLA leaving at 18.40pm. They told us that the problem was another crew related issue! They rebooked us on plane departing PHL at 21.55 and arriving LHR at 10.00 the next morning then book us on a British Airways flight to GLA leaving at 12.10 arriving at 13.55 we would have originally been in GLA at 7.00 am but did not arrive till 14.00pm. When questioned US Airways said that there compensation policy is to just rebook passengers ASAP on the next flight available. The plane going from MCO-PHL an A330 did not have any inflight entertainment on this route despite having seat back TV's. That happened to be the same plane taking us to LHR but on that journey there was in-flight entertainment. So would not use US again unless desperate and would not recommend. Otherwise BA gave superb service on their flight and would defiantly recommend.

Flew GLA-PHL-MCO and return. Excellent in every way Seats and legroom were good food was the usual economy food but does me fine check-in was quick and simple staff pleasant and flights on time what more can I ask for. Only down side was the video screens I was in window seat and couldn't see it properly but didn't bother me that much really. Would fly with them again no problem.

LHR-CLT-TPA-CLT-LHR. All flights left on time flights on the international leg is an A330-300 which is a good aircraft 2-4-2 seat configuration large seat back screens for showing a good selection of movies. TV shows games etc seating was ok with good legroom on all the flights. My only complaint is the food both ways the offering was chicken with rice or pasta surely they can come up with more choice than this also a muffin for breakfast is not much to offer. One other gripe I have but this is not exclusively US airways but all American carriers why are passengers allowed to take such large baggage in the cabin some suitcases were bigger than mine that went in the hold. Generally I was pleased with the service I got on all flights and would use US airways again for future travel.

BCN to JAX rtn via PHL. Philadelphia Airport seems to come in for a lot of stick on this forum but you can only speak as you find and my wife and I found it a very pleasant improvement to the likes of JFK MIA and LAX as regards transfers. More space and less like a cattle market. Paid to go in the US Club which was very pleasant and well worth twenty odd dollars. Only waited 5 mins to clear immigration which is far less than anywhere else we've encountered in the States. As for US Airways well we've now been on all of the "big four" in the last couple of years (first time with US) and to be honest I really cannot see any difference in any of them. In all four in economy space is getting tighter and tighter and food/drink on offer is getting less and less and poorer and poorer quality. But if people want low fares then there's the rub I guess. At least US run modern planes (A-330 200's) on this route with Emb 175 on the domestic sector far better than poky CRJ's etc. The Airbus is far better than the triple sevens or the ancient 747s or 767s used by some and at least if you are travelling as a couple you just get two seats and don't have to share. AVOD in all seats which is better than many. Overall still miles behind people like Air New Zealand but they are only of any use if you want somewhere out West. In short as long as you don't expect luxury from any of these American giants you won't be disappointed. I'm getting to regard them as a bigger Ryanair ie just a cost effective way of getting from A to B.

### US Airways customer review
Horrible customer service. Slow staff and tight connections don't mix. Not accommodating or apologetic whatsoever for missed flights in a tight connection they allow but shouldn't if the whole process of getting from one flight to another will take so long. Closed the flight early with no announcement that I could hear as I was rushing to the gate. They knew I wasn't on board and my bag was or wasn't. Probably had plenty of standby passengers to take my place. Waste of time. Fly a real airlines and don't bother with these dinosaurs.

### US Airways customer review
So many bad points that I'm not sure they will all fit! 1) Do not pay for 'preferred' access. I forget exactly what the name is but I paid$ 31 for this in order to board the airplane 'early' but was told by the attendant that it didn't mean anything just go by the zone number. 2) The food ran out and I was told I could pre-order but when I tried to do this for my return flight I couldn't as the website only listed the food but there wasn't a way to actually order and pay for it. 3) This has already been said but the seats are extremely uncomfortable. I purchased seats by the window so I could lean against them to sleep as I had to travel from the UK to AZ. In total I paid an additional $267 for these seats but I shouldn't have bothered as the space between the seat and the window was so far that I couldn't lean against it at all. 4) The return plane 'broke down' and so we had to wait approximately 4 extra hours this was at night and the airline graciously gave us a $10 voucher for a meal while we waited but the voucher was only good for shops in the airport but it was so expensive all I was able to buy was a bottle of water and a bag of chips. 4) Because of the plane braking down I was going to miss the coach (bus) in London that would take me home and I had already paid for it. I will never travel on US Airways again.

Flight from OAK-PHX-PIT. Wasn't supposed to change planes in PHX but they changed that. Took my boarding pass in OAK and refused to reprint one in Phoenix told me that's too bad for you and "not my problem". Fortunately I printed two and the gate attendant snarked at me saying "well aren't you just smarter than the rest of us! Continued on to PIT and requested a Kosher meal since I'm lactose intolerant. What do they bring me? Ham and cheese!

PHL-MCO 15 October 2013 on 757. Very tired plane could do with an update but the airline have got new planes on order so it maybe replaced. Service ok. Nothing special but did what was required. Cabin crew very pleasant. Happy to recommend. Only downfall no IFE.

Flew from Halifax to Philadelphia to Dublin return. Regional jet from YHZ. On-time with the normal drink service. An older 767 from Philadelphia to Dublin in Envoy. Good service wonderful meals- likely the best airline I have flown for the quantity of food - you are not left hungry. Choice of 4 meals and a hot breakfast choice too. On time and overall good. Return to Philadelphia on the same aircraft in Envoy. Really great service and food was outstanding. Philadelphia to Halifax on a new Embraer and very comfortable. Overall this airline does a great job in my experience (this was my second trip to Dublin this year with them). And a very nice touch with the menus being in English and Gaelic.

### US Airways customer review
Very inconvenient. They have a smart phone app that you can do everything on except print a boarding pass. When you arrive at the airport you have to either go to the regular or wait in the self serve kiosk line both of which are very long. We checked in on the app had to wait in line to get a boarding pass so we could check our bags. Bag fees are $25 each. If you want a choice of seats that is $45 per person. If you want expedited boarding that is another $25 per person. Our flight was about 2 1/2 hours long. We were not offered snacks to purchase. We got one tiny cup of water/soda half filled with ice and then another cup of coffee or water for that entire time. Bring water or a beverage and food with you. The seats are very uncomfortable for a person who is short is stature they do not fit the neck properly and you cannot recline far enough to be comfortable.

### US Airways customer review
The pilot claimed to have have miscalculated his fuel needs of Flight US3280 leaving San Antonio to Charlotte and so about 10 minutes outside of Charlotte needed to make an emergency stop at Spartanburg to get fuel. After approximately 30 minutes on the ground we were told we had fuel and would be taking off shortly ten minutes later the pilot announced that he had again miscalculated our fuel need so we needed to wait for another fuel truck to give us even more fuel. After about a total delay of an hour we finally got back in the air and arrived in Charlotte at which time all the passengers who had missed connecting flights were sent to various hotels to await morning flights. I left Charlotte the next morning at 9.30 for Minneapolis my final destination still outraged by the seeming unconcern for the needless danger that this pilot and crew had for the safety and convenience of the passengers.

### US Airways customer review
A friend and I recently traveled from Louisville to Philadelphia to Barcelona. The initial flight (9/26/13) was fine. On the return trip from Barcelona to Louisville (10/6/13) the situation was very difficult. We were late leaving Barcelona so there was necessarily a rush through Customs and Security. We already had our boarding passes confirmed from the day before. When we arrived on time at the Philadelphia gate to go on to Charlotte our seats had been given away. What raises questions for us is that when we deplaned in Philadelphia an agent handed us a possible change of flights. Was that because our seats were already given away or because we had to go through Customs etc. and it was unlikely that we would make it?

### US Airways customer review
Flight from CLT to Dublin on a 20 year plus 757-200 in economy. Just like sitting on a bus and the service was poor. On return trip upgraded to Envoy class and other then larger seats the service and food offerings were not one would expect for the additional cost. Maybe the CEO of this airline needs to take some anonymous trips so he can experience the poor customer service this airline provides. No doubt the CLT to DUB is a money maker for them as the service is poor the aircraft old the seats uncomfortable and the flight attendants non accommodating.

### US Airways customer review
JFK-CLT-RDU return in early October 2013. US Air isn't officially a budget carrier but the vibe certainly was budget. Basic amenities no IFE limited cash menu. Service was OK but not very efficient.

### US Airways customer review
My husband and I were on US Air flight from Phoenix to Boston. The agent at the gate closed the door 7 minutes before the official departure time. We were already at the gate as he was closing it and he refused to let us on. The reason we were delayed were long lines at check-in the computer system not being able to find our legitimate reservation another long line to speak with a live agent followed by a long line at security. The worst element of this experience was the smugness of the agent when he refused to let us on the plane. I'm a frequent business traveler I fly every week (and have been doing it for the past 10 years).

Philadelphia to Tel Aviv in economy on A 330-200. This is the 3rd time I used US Air's direct flight for my home town Philadelphia to Tel Aviv The plane was new and the seats had adequate leg room. I prefer the 2x4x2 seating configuration on the A 330 over the 2x5x2 or 3x3x3 configuration of the B777. The on demand entertainment system had a good list of programing. The food was not very good but that is to be expected and they ran out of one of the breakfast options on the return flight. The best part of the flight though were the flight attendants. They were very friendly and professional.

### US Airways customer review
My husband and I have just returned from a trip to the States flying from Manchester UK to San Francisco via Philadelphia then back from Seattle to Manchester. We arrived on time with baggage as one expects but the cabin service experience was poor particularly on the return transatlantic leg. The A330 has an outdated interior and insufficient lavatories. The seat back entertainment was difficult to use and the meals very small. The banana muffin and nothing else for breakfast was a joke. The crew were embarrassed to serve it. Only water juice and tea were available and no coffee. We have travelled to the Far East several times in recent years and the service provided by Emirates and especially Singapore Airlines was far superior.

### US Airways customer review
I stopped flying this airline years ago for all the reasons cited in this forum. However I was convinced by my travel agent to reconsider and booked a round trip flight from PHL to DUB. Delays and mechanical issues are par for the course with this airline and they didn't "disappoint. Take off from PHL was delayed three hours. But what has convinced me to never fly with them again is the treatment by the flight crew during both the delay and the flight. I have never experienced a more miserable and inattentive crew in all of my years of flying. What justification does this company have for treating customers in this way? What an awful experience. I will not fly with them again ever.

### US Airways customer review
My husband and I went to Aruba for our honeymoon a few weeks ago. We will never fly with them again! The middle of July comes around and we receive a phone call from US Airways saying they cancelled the flight we booked so we needed to choose a different flight. The only two options available were to either leave and come back the same dates but the travel time was 2 days worth each way or to leave a day early and get a hotel to be able to make it on the next flight leaving the following morning. The second option was our only reasonable choice out of the two. By leaving a day early this meant that my husband and I were going to have to miss an additional day's worth of work. We asked the agent if we could be compensated with a free hotel stay or for our bags and her answer was no. When we get to the baggage check in counter they tell us that we still need to pay for our bags. We stood there arguing with them that we already paid for our bags online. 30 minutes later this was finally straightened out. On our way back from Aruba we ran into the same issue with baggage fees (which we ended up having to pay for twice). We fly into Philadelphia to find out that our flight to Chicago has been delayed 5 hours which puts us getting into Chicago at around 2.00 am. We still had a flight to get on out of Chicago at 8.00 am. They apologize and said it was a staffing issue and that there were no other flights leaving the airport except that one. This was our first and last time with this airline!

I was flying from NYC to Dublin Ireland today with a stopover in Philadelphia. There were no problems with my flight from NYC to Philly however that's where the luck ran out. There was an issue with downsizing the aircraft at Philly and so numerous passengers were left stranded I had been told I may have to wait for another flight tomorrow - which thankfully was not the case in the end. Having finally made it onto the flight and taking off an hour later than expected it didn't take much time to realise it was going to be a long journey home. The aircraft itself was tiny two lanes of 3 seats each which I have never encountered on an international flight before. It was cramped the food was awful and the attendants were difficult to deal with disgruntled and overall not welcoming in the slightest. I'm afraid US Airways won't be getting business from me again.

### US Airways customer review
Traveled from Honolulu-Phoenix and Phoenix-New York (JFK) which were both 5 plus hour flights. Economy seating on the first flight was cramped and uncomfortable and inflight crew were unfriendly. Felt more like an overnight bus service. Service on second flight was significantly better but aircraft didn't have any inflight entertainment - not even drop down screens. Chose US Airways due to the cost advantage but next time will spend extra in order to have a much better inflight experience and feel better at my final destination.

### US Airways customer review
Flight was on time. Flew first class which was a mistake. Other than a little more leg room no real discernible difference than coach. Food was bad service was nowhere close to first class or business class. They had two meal selections but when they got to me there was only one. Mind you there were only 12 people in first class. There is absolutely no inflight entertainment. Very odd for a modern carrier. Flight attendant told me they got rid of inflight players because of the cost and weight. Seriously if that is why they got rid of it then they are apparently the only ones. If they are cutting costs that much I'd rather fly another airline who cares about the passenger experience. If flying coach probably ok if you get a really good deal. If business or first class definitely not worth it.

### US Airways customer review
Flew Philadelphia - Zurich in economy. Plane was a 767 exactly 26 years old. Quite run-down inside no in-flight entertainment. I sat in a 'window seat' yet there was no window. Apparently this is a quirk several of the front rows in the old 767s. Food was poor and very little. Guests are offered only a single glass of wine at no charge and this comes out of a paper bottle. Breakfast consisted of a nothing but a small banana muffin. Cabin crew never came around with water or snacks in between meals. In-flight entertainment was non existent. No magazines offered except for the US Airways magazine. Their airport Club lounges are little better than their actual flights. No food offered beyond chips and a few olives. Alcohol is strictly limited. I will try to avoid this airline at all costs particularly as the 767s are scheduled to be in service for another 4 years. Few airlines in the world (apart from the African ones) fly such old aircraft.

Flew Manchester to San Francisco via PHL. Plenty of leg room  seats comfortable food average (but I've had a lot worse). Slight delay at PHL due to thunderstorms. Very disappointed that PHL to SFO (5.5 hours) wasn't deemed worthy of inflight entertainment. This leg of the journey was made worse by the ridiculous attitude of so many UIS fliers who take so much baggage on the plane and then moan because there is no where to store it all. Never met so many rude and selfish people in a long time. Return leg was better lovely crews on both legs less whinging  penny pinching US flyers made it a nicer experience. Would use again.

Flying between Gulfport MS to New York City. Twice we were delayed due to maintenance. Flight attendants were not pleasant - they were absolutely rude to some foreign passengers. We were first class but had the worst service ever encountered on any airline! Now we are sitting in Charlotte with another delay due to maintenance. I have yet to hear anyone apologize or even care. I will not fly this airline if I can avoid it!

Booked to leave FLL to BOS for travel assignment with a connection in Charlotte. At the gate I was told I would need to check my bag because the flight was very full. After boarding it was discovered that there was a malfunction. Whilst waiting we were told there was another malfunction and there would be a 90 minute delay. We were let off the plane and then re-boarded. Put on another flight this time connecting through PHL. Another delay but we did get to PHL and left FLL prior to the reported time of departure. Got to PHL to find out that there was another delay a gate change and the flight we were set to take was no longer even on the departure board. Told to check the monitors for flight changes. Ended up sitting in PHL for another 90 minutes and the gate was filthy. Upon getting to PHL at approximately 1.45am we were told that our bags never left PHL. It is now 2.58 and our bags just arrived. I have traveled extensively domestically and this is by far the worst airline I have flown.

We flew from Amsterdam to Los Angeles with a switch of planes in Philadelphia on 23/8-/2013. Flying back on 6/9/2013 and I must say we are not looking forward to our flight back. We are used to Delta and United and thought lets try US Airways this time around. The flight is quite long 8 hours and 4.45 hours. The seats were ok we had enough room as long as the person in front of us did not change his seat setting to lay down. The main thing is the plane we were in flew from Amsterdam to Philly with no personal entertainment it had overhead screens with poor quality video which you could hardly see from the window seat. I think for such long flights personal entertainment is a must have we were really disappointed and did not expect this especially not since we were used to all of that with Delta and United. So we arrived in Philly and the transfer to the new plane went well. We got on our new plane an A321 from Philly to LA. Flight time 4.45 minutes. Guess what no personal entertainment onboard not even an overhead screen. The crew were nice the food moderate but I will never fly with them again.

Manchester to Philadelphia and return August 2013. I can only assume that the negative comments on this forum come from a very small minority who have had a bad experience with US Airways or serial complainers as I can offer nothing but praise for my own family's recent flights with this airline. Our main consideration was how the seats would be for nearly eight hours and I have to say that they were very comfortable with a substantial amount of leg-room. The food on the way out was excellent not quite so good on the way back but still OK. The personal entertainment on offer was very impressive and the cabin staff polite and friendly. Flights were on time both ways. From my own experience I would certainly recommend this airline for transatlantic flights.

Flew Dublin - Philadelphia Philadelphia to Orlando May 2013. If you are able to spend a little bit more to fly with a different airline do it. Party of 7 including 3 kids. Staff boarder line rude on DUB to PHL PHL to DUB flights. Delays PHL to Orlando Orlando - PHL. Reduced size of plane PHL to DUB and told customers tough luck if you were in the row that no longer existed total shambles at boarding. Apparently had still been selling the flight at PHL even though massively over booked. In flight entertainment from the ninety's. Will never use them again. We were flying budget but still can't believe the poor level of service for a budget airline.

It seems like some things never change since I ended up spending the night in the Philly airport last night. Came in from Punta Cana on a US Airways flight which was delayed getting to Punta Cana. Our flight ended up leaving over an hour late from Punta Cana even though we were told it would only be a half hour delayed. Once arrived in Philly we ran to the gate from security and ended up missing the flight to Tampa. The plane was still at the gate but we were told it was too late. We went to customer service where they did nothing but give me a boarding pass for a flight at 8am the next morning. They claimed it wasn't the airlines fault we missed our connection since our original US Airways flight was delayed. Had to sleep in the Philly airport. US Airways you disappointed me yet again.

Out of the big US carriers this one is my favourite. Will miss it as it becomes American and thus a One World partner. The plane on the Atlanta - Hartford (via Charlotte) route was a relatively new A320. I find their first class to have the most legroom out of all the US carriers. The meal was decent and the service at least pleasant. Their wifi system also worked very well.

My girlfriend and I flew from YHZ-PHL-BDA in First Class last month. All flight attendants were friendly and provided the best service with the limited product that they could. All flights were on time and there were no baggage issues. No meal on any flight and zero in flight entertainment on any flight. Drinks were served in plastic cups in First Class. The seats were fine but US Airways needs to be put out of their misery. I hope that the merger with American goes ahead and the service on the merged airline is stepped up because right now the domestic/ North American product on US Airways is two-star not three. It is a pastime in Canada to complain about the service on Air Canada. I would encourage everyone who complains about Air Canada to fly with US Airways they will realize how lucky we are to have Air Canada.

We flew Boston-Philly-Zurich and back. All flights were on time. All personnel both in the airports an on the flights were competent and pleasant.

1788 CLT to ORD. This is definitely the worst airline. Every flight is delayed. Never taken off on time in the last 3 years. Add to that the rude staff at the counter who usually don't have any information. They keep blaming everything on 'inbound aircraft. And this is at the hub Charlotte where they have plenty of aircraft's to redeploy.

London Heathrow travel outbound through Charlotte NC return through Philadelphia. Both ways a fairly new Airbus A330-300 with great entertainment system and average seating for transatlantic economy class. Our issues with US Airways is not with their international service it is with their horrific domestic service and the worst customer service experience imaginable. We live less than 2 hours from the Philadelphia airport and spent twice as much time as we did on the plane from London Heathrow to our home. They're cancelled all flights to our local airport and after 13 hours in an airport less than 2 hours from our home we had to rent a car (at our own expense) to drive home because US Airways cannot complete a transaction. This has happened now 3 times. Avoid Philadelphia completely and be warned that US Airways customer service will treat you horribly.

The plane was old all toilets except one in first class stopped working 2 hours before we landed on a transatlantic flight from Philadelphia to Athens Greece. The food was not edible the flight attendants were rude! The entertainment system was ancient and the movie stopped 3/4 of the way and could not continue. My nephew traveled a few days earlier and had similar complaints. My worst transatlantic flight in the 50+ years I've been going back and forth!

GVA-FRA-CLT-BOS on 1 August. I am tall 196 cm. Surprisingly the flight FRA CLT was comfortable the seat pitch was ok I didn't put my legs on the aisle. Flight on time. The second flight was delayed 1 hour due to weather conditions which was totally understandable. Return was SFO-PHL-ZRH here I was lucky to have on the both flights the bulkhead seats which have a lot of space. The food was average but this is not an important factor for me. Generally I had a very good experience with US Airways!

### US Airways customer review
SEA-CLT-HHH return. Not a single flight was on time. Crews were indifferent at best and otherwise berating their employer to passengers. Their primary interest was in getting credit card applications. Seats were extremely tight in first noticeably less pitch than narrowbody flights on United or American. No entertainment no power outlets. The food was tragic on the outbound edible on the return but served without linens and with a paper napkin. No milk for coffee on domestic flights. Although I had a revenue first class ticket for $1700 US Airways still wanted me to pay extra for better seats on each flight(!) The Charlotte hub was a mess signs were broken moving sidewalks inoperable and my gates changed on the spur of the moment in each direction. Bags took close to 45 minutes to be unloaded in Seattle about 20 minutes in Hilton Head.

We had flown with SAS to Amsterdam and US Airways should take us to Philadelphia and then Seattle. On our returning trip back we started at LA with stops in Philadelphia and Frankfurt. On our trip to Seattle our flight from Philadelphia to Seattle was cancelled due to mechanical issues so we had to wait a couple of hours and take a connecting flight through San Francisco. My baggage had somehow been lost in Philadelphia - so did not receive it until the day after I arrived. The same thing happened on my way back I was obligated to hand over my hand baggage when boarding. I have flown many different companies through the years but this is the worst experience. The inflight service was okay - but bagage handling was apparently non existent.

US Airways itself was not too bad. The problem was the smaller airlines they contract to. Boston to DC (Reagan) - not too bad was on time at least. DC to Chicago - delayed but no idea why. Sat in Chicago for 2 hours boarded deplaned boarded again - they "couldn't find the pilot". Finally got to Des Moines. Two days later Des Moines to Charlotte - delayed no idea why. While waiting for my carry-on to be retrieved from "valet checking" so I could make my connection to Philadelphia the gate attendant was quite rude when I asked the status of my connection. Ran through the airport to make the connection then sat on the plane for 30 minutes. Was also told that I would need to check my carry-on because there was "no room" in the overhead compartment. When I boarded most of the overhead compartments were open - several were empty most were less than half full. Had to collect bag from baggage claim when I got to Philadelphia but at least I didn't have to pay for it. Philadelphia to Boston was slightly delayed because of a check engine light that came on after we were all boarded. They did manage to get maintenance in fairly quickly and apparently got the problem resolved - but this was US Air not a smaller airline. I'm going back to Southwest and Jet Blue - cheaper more reliable more customer oriented and they keep better track of their pilots.

FRA-PHL-SFO. Total mess - 2 of 4 FRA-originating flights delayed due to weather apparently. My FRA-PHL flight delayed 2 hours missing the PHL-SFO connection. About 100 people in line to the ticket desk in FRA because the FRA-CLT flight was delayed 7 hours. Called US Airways and was rebooked within 5 minutes. Excellent customer service. US Airways flights depart from by far the worst part of FRA airport (and one of the worst areas of any airport anywhere). No food no shops nothing - gate was changed unannounced then everyone was asked to leave the gate area to be re-checked. As I said complete mess by both airport and airline staff. In the end flight arrived PHL 2 hours late as expected. PHL-SFO flight also delayed without reason or apology by 2 hours meaning arrival to SFO at a cringeworthy 1.30am. Bag thankfully redirected and I have to admit service by flight attendants great throughout and good iFE on the FRA-PHL flight.

Flew PHL-CDG and CDG-CLT in Economy. US Air was the low cost carrier for this route and it showed. Food was fundamentally inedible but I was grateful to have brought my own. Crews were mostly friendly and helpful. Flight seemed to be a non-stop sales pitch to buy duty free upgraded snacks etc. I thought several times that this unnecessarily disturbed what could have been a serene flight. Had the new Airbus planes both ways. Someone had broken off the tip of their headphones in the receptacle and the poor FA could not remove it even after returning with tweezers. Thus I could not use the AVOD for the entire eight hour flight. US Air got me there mostly on time but this was not a very enjoyable or peaceful experience.

### US Airways customer review
Have mixed feelings about the airline. I think they have decent flight service. I took the Dublin - PHL route and was surprised by the cheerful service aboard. Food was good and there was free wine (United needs to learn about this). My domestic connection got delayed and the personnel were not very helpful with the situation (I tried to get in an earlier flight and they did not help with it). I ended up flying that segment with Jet Blue and complain later. The customer service representative received the feedback and took actions about it. I would still recommend them particularly for international flights.

Kona-ABQ via Phoenix in first class. US Airways first class is worse than some coach seats I have been in. The seat in front of me was rubbing against my legs (I would expect this in coach but in first?). One drink run before take off and not another one for 4 hours. The meal was edible but very small and disappointing. On the second flight the crew was nicer but than again they are not US airways because the flight was operated by skywest. I had a 3 hour layover in Phoenix and even though I had paid for first class I was only allowed into the lounge if I gave them more money.

SFO-PHL-FRA trying US Airways for the first time after being rebooked "from" them onto other airlines due to delays. Surprised with how decent they are. Both flights had roomy (though not very comfortable) seats excellent service on-board and arrived on time/early. Acceptable food on the PHL-FRA and even free wine - not that it's any good. IFE system is excellent on the A330s. Would fly again.

Very frustrating experience with US Air when flying to Glasgow last week. Our traveling parties were meeting in PHL to connect to the same transatlantic flight. Both flights delayed due to weather but they go in to PHL at around the same time. Our flight then sat out on the tarmac for 1.5 hrs because they didn't have a gate for us. While we were stuck out there the captain kept saying all flights out were grounded so we would make our connections but that wasn't true as mine left leaving me stranded. Next flight waited for passengers to come in from a delayed flight. Why couldn't they do that for me? I finally made it to Glasgow the next day via London but missed the first day of vacation. On the way back our flight was delayed 2 hours due to maintenance and the next one was as well. On top of all this the staff were rude pushy and the flight attendants were surly the meals were gross and the TV sound did not work throughout so that was 7 hours with nothing to watch. They also kept running out of drinks and food by the time they reached our seats. If I can help it I will never fly US Air again!

Left LAX on Saturday to take my daughter to Providence. Flight delayed and we missed out connecting flight to providence was stranded in Philadelphia. They did not offer any help and just gave us new tickets to come back to airport next day. Sunday morning went to airport realizing that they had booked my 16 daughter on a different flight to DC! Ended up renting a car and driving. Went back to airport on Monday 7/22 to catch my flight to LAX. Flight from Providence was late again and I missed my connection again. Was re-routed to Phoenix and stayed on the plane for 3 hours for bad weather and missed the connection from Phoenix to LA. Stranded in Phoenix again and finally made it to Orange county airport on Tuesday.

Choice Seats aren't choice at all. We flew a 6pm to midnight flight from Philadelphia to Glasgow on 17 July 2013. We paid $99.00 each for "Choice" seats 24A and 24B. These were considered choice seats by the airline because they are Emergency Exit seats with the extra leg room. Unfortunately they are directly behind the lavatories. The cabin lights were dimmed we took out our blankets and pillows closed our eyes and someone opened the lavatory door flooding our seating area with glaring florescent light. Our plans for catching a nap were ruined.

Flew London to Philadelphia then on to Greensboro NC and return. Outbound the first leg was excellent. The connecting flight to PTI was delayed as there was no fuel in the aircraft then an engine failed on start up. The Captain kept us informed as the engineers tried to fix it and an hour later we boarded a replacement airframe. On the return there was an hour delay at Philadelphia due to the aircraft being "too hot in the cabin" as it had been sat in the sun all day but the staff kept us informed of progress. What I did appreciate was that the bags went straight through and were ready to collect straight away. There is always room for improvement but I think these guys should focus a bit more on the maintenance - get the aircraft ready earlier and make sure it is serviceable before the flight - not wait until everyone is at the gate waiting to board.

DFW to Phoenix 6/30/13. Then from Phoenix to San Diego because of fog problems the plane could not land so they re-routed us to Phoenix. During this time I had a connection flight leaving San Diego and my husband and I missed our connection flight leaving San Diego to Hawaii. I went to the Phoenix counter to just get a brush off and were told that another flight was leaving San Diego to Hawaii that day. By the time we arrived in San Diego that morning we had been left stranded. I will never take a flight to San Diego nor will I fly US Airways. They offered to fly us out 2 days later. I had to purchase a whole new ticket that night to get us to our destination.

Every time I book a flight I promise myself that I will not use US Airways again. Unfortunately they are the only airline that fly into Hilton Head Island so we are captive to them. Once again they have cancelled our flight from the island into Charlotte and we will not make our flight to Phoenix. The explanation given was "weather" in Charlotte. Doppler radar says 30% chance of rain in Charlotte during the time we would have been there. The only thing I hate worse than a cancelled flight is a blatant lie about the reason the flight was cancelled. No compensation given at all. Can't get out until tomorrow.

Dublin to Charlotte (5th July 13) Charlotte to Dublin (12th July 13). Disappointment at both flights but especially Dublin to Charlotte: 1) ran out of earphones so no entertainment for 8 hours. 2) one of the toilets out of order for full flight. 3) another toilet ran out of toilet paper. 4) hot breakfast ice cold. Return flight - my wife asked if we could upgrade but were told flight full. Expected to depart at 6.20pm but did not board until approx 7pm despite on-time advised. Made to sit on plane while we waited for passengers from another flight who had missed their flight to Paris - eventual departure 8pm. Some of these were put in first class although we had been told flight full with no upgrades!

Have always traveled using U.S. Airways usually from Charlotte NC to NYC. Last year entrusted them with our 16 year old traveling alone to Paris for a month. This year we traveled as a family to Paris and will be using them again in August as they now have a direct flight from Charlotte NC to Dublin Ireland. Have never had any trouble with this airline. Luckily no bad weather so flights have always been on time. My only complaint is on domestic flights they let people with huge carry-on luggage board and they fill up the available overhead spaced. I have had to check my regulation size carry on bag on a couple of occasions for lack of room. They don't seem to care what size your carry on bag is. Also food is awful but this is probably true of most airlines. Staff have always been friendly and helpful.

Two days trying to get from LGA to MEM through DC. Flight from DC to Memphis was delayed 2 hrs then they put us on the plane and after 2 hrs seated they cancelled the fight. Trying to get back to NY after 2 hours inside the plane they cancel again. They put me on another flight to NY which finally left after another additional 2 hrs delay. Next day: try to get to Memphis again LGA-CLT ok but the second flight CLT-MEM was 2 hrs delayed again. Staff unhelpful and rude. Will never use their service again.

### US Airways customer review
PHL-SDF and SDF-PHL. Flights were on time on both occasions. Comfortable flight and we had a pleasant crew member both ways. US Airways operates small aircraft on this sector so the interiors were cramped but overall good experience considering that this was one of the few direct flights between PHL and SDF and the flight duration's were just over an hour and half each.

### US Airways customer review
EWR-PHL-FRA: Ground staff on EWR were friendly and made efforts to put me on an earlier flight as the original flight to PHL was delayed. PHL-FRA was a brand new Airbus 330 in fact only 4 weeks old so the aircraft itself was in order except the staff. Apart from one crew member all others were rude and any request from passengers seemed like bother. Apart from surly crew drinks were available for free except alcohol and food was just awful. On positive note the AVOD has good selection and soft drinks available in gallery. I would avoid US Airways because of the attitude of crew and bad food.

### US Airways customer review
Flight from Charlottesville VA to Chicago cancelled due to mechanical issues. Put on a flight the next day and given the worst seats on the plane even though there were seats available for a $25 up charge. Given the run- around. Talked to 5 different people and everyone said someone else should be able to do it. Never again.

### US Airways customer review
FRA-EWR: Outbound flight was old Boeing 737 instead of Airbus A330. Ground staff at FRA are friendly. Once boarded the flight was delayed 35 mins and information given by captain. It was all aged male crew. The crew were polite and friendly enough to cater most of the needs. The big change I experienced that drinks were unlimited compared to past where you had to buy drinks. Crew made about 3 to 4 rounds for drinks and later only seen during breakfast round. Being an old aircraft there were no personal TV but they played three different movies on those ceiling attached TV's. They also loaded my requested meal which was compared to none but trash. All in all experience could have been much better if they provide Airbus aircraft.

Flight from Charlotte to Rome June 20. Rude crew no manners 6 staff frowned and looked like we were bothering them by simply being there. No hello no you're welcome just gruff minimal words. Not one crew member said 'thank you for flying with us" etc as we disembarked. Just stood there watching all the passengers leave the plane. Return trip was July 1 2013 - service was just as bad. We went through Philly and had same negative and rude treatment on the ground. They cancelled our Philly - Hartford flight. We had to wait over 5 hours for our connection. One person only on the entire Rome - Philadelphia flight said thank you and was pleasant. On a positive note the crew from Philadelphia to Hartford were very nice.

Will never fly with US Airways again. Everyone boarded and was kept on flight for an hour due to maintenance problems. Temperature in Phoenix while stuck on the flight was over 100 degrees. We were kept waiting on the flight for an hour. Water was brought around but it was poured into cups. We were not given full bottles. Turns out there was an issue with a window. Flight was delayed an hour then a couple more hours. Currently flight is pushed back to 6 pm with an original 10.45am departure time.

Wilmington NC to Philadelphia and Philadelphia to Burlington Vermont. First flight delayed for 'maintenance' a couple of hours then finally canceled. Then booked on evening flight at 7.40pm. That flight canceled due to weather. Finally I took a flight the next morning at 6.40 arrived to my destination a day late. My return trip scheduled for 5.40 pm but there was a delay. Counter personnel could not give straight answers or decent advise. No other flights had to pay out for a hotel room that's not covered due to weather cancellation. Got an email confirmation on a 6.50am flight the next day I showed up to the counter and they did not have me on that flight. Now I'm booked on a 7.50 flight to Washington DC and a 1.50 flight home. I will make US Airways my last choice.

6/16/13. Flew from San Francisco CA to Cancun MX via Phoenix. You have to check in your self they don't have a counter person to help you with check in at least not at San Francisco. I was traveling with my family total of 7 3 adults and 4 Kids it was not easy at all. US airways employee's were rude and not very helpful. If you want a snack you need to pay for it all they offered on a 5 hours flight was coffee and water. Will never use this airline again.

LAX to Rome via Philly. The trip there went smoothly but there was weather coming home which delayed our flight. However we had a 3 hour lay over in Philly and arrived with 2 hours to make the connecting flight. When we presented our boarding passes we were told that our seats were cancelled as they didn't think we would make the flight. I was traveling with my elderly mother so I insisted that they get us on that flight. In the end they found seats for most of us but I had to sit separately from my mother and kids. To add insult to injury some people did not get on the flight although there were still empty seats. They cancelled our seats and put us all through turmoil for nothing. Our gate was also changed with no notice and at one point they had 3 flights waiting in one boarding area. No organization and I have flown with them for the last time.

### US Airways customer review
Every flight I had scheduled had a major problem. Flight from Harrisburg to Philadelphia was immediately declared as 1 hour delay. While waiting we were told that we would be on time and they boarded us after several passengers had already been deferred to other flights. We sat on the plane for 25 minutes. Pilot notified that we would be leaving. Pilot then asked all of us to leave the plane again. We left the plane and returned to waiting area. While waiting for information regarding our flight to Philadelphia I was called to redirect my flight from Harrisburg to Charlotte NC to Sacramento. I would be arriving 2 hours later than my original schedule. (Previously 8.45 now 10.45). We finally arrived in Sacramento and when arriving at gate the pilot found another US Airline in our arrival gate. We sat for 20 minutes. We sat for at least 20 minutes waiting for availability of a gate for our plane to arrive. I got home at midnight originally would have arrived by 9.45. I was called to desk and transferred to a flight to Charlotte NC. I was to arrive at my original destination Sacramento over 2 hours later than my original flights.

Cleveland to Fort Walton Beach via Charlotte. Both flights delayed. Once we boarded the second flight we sat on the runway for 45 minutes while mechanics changed a tyre. Coming back I flew Pensacola to Cleveland via Charlotte. Actually got in early to Charlotte around 5pm but found out that another US Airways plane took our gate so sat on the runway for 40 minutes. Connecting flight to Cleveland departed at 5.50. Needing to get off the plane I asked the flight attendant how much longer because I was going to miss my flight. She said they have no control over missed flights. Very rude and not accommodating at all! Once I finally got off the plane at 5.40pm I ran though the airport to make my flight to Cleveland. With 20 seconds to spare we made it. But I will never be flying US Airways again!

### US Airways customer review
Flew First Class from PHX to EWR round trip. Outgoing flight weather delayed 3 hrs (not their fault). Food inedible and served cold. Unbelievable for First Class. No entertainment no headphones etc. Not a quiet flight either since the 2 attendants sitting nearby in the jump seats were chattering for the entire flight when not serving. Return flight food slightly edible similar to coach several years ago. Gate agent failed to flag luggage as First Class so it was delivered last. Very bad experience especially coming off a First Class flight on Hawaiian Air which was very pleasant.

St. Louis to Orlando via Charlotte. First flight left late and they made no effort to hold our connecting flight (on the same carrier). Provided no information on gate changes and we missed our meetings. Got up at 3am only to end cooling our heels in Charlotte all day. Will never book with them again.

London-Charlotte connecting Charlotte-San Francisco. As others have said Envoy service LHR-Charlotte was fine. Bad things happened once we arrived in Charlotte. Plane sat on tarmac for 30 minutes in queue. Then a large storm arrived as plane had not departed on time we were caught in the storm. Sat on tarmac for nearly 2 hours. Pilot told us every 15 minutes that "Plane returning to gate for hail inspection". Once parked at gate after 2 hrs pilot told us: "Leave plane if you want just take boarding pass". We followed this advice. After 15 minutes in terminal called airline to ask if we could rebook given uncertainty and they said BTW the flight is cancelled. Gate staff would not let us back on plane to collect carry-on's. We re-booked on another flight. We were told it would depart from Gate 15 then Gate 8 then Gate 15 then back to Gate 8. Flight finally left 2 hours late. None of our bags arrived even though airline had 2 hours to transfer to new flight and we were assured this would occur. Waited in long line at 1am to file lost baggage report. Our last flight with this airline. Food on domestic legs inedible no inflight entertainment.

### US Airways customer review
It started badly when we arrived at the airport to discover that US Airways had separated my husband and me from each other - for an international flight. The ticket agent was rude and inflexible. It culminated on the return trip where we were again separated. The TV/video system does not respond to touch and in order to make something happen you practically have to pound on the screen - obviously affecting the person sitting in the seat in front of you. The restrooms were filthy. Our flight was canceled from PHL to IND because of weather and the agents rescheduling us were rude. We were re-scheduled for a flight 12 hours later which turned out to be the best scenario for our group (43 of us). Most of us had luggage that did not make it until the next day. I truly do not know how US Airways continues to operate with customer service being so poor.

### US Airways customer review
If you are disabled don't fly US Airways. I made the mistake of booking a non direct flight instead of a non-stop flight. Flight delayed over an hour in Philadelphia. I sat on the plane for an hour unable to leave to get some food as the transporter had already left. The flight attendant did offer me some water apple juice chips and salsa free of charge. Flight left Boston at 11.30 and did not leave Philadelphia until 3 or later. When we finally arrived in Atlanta after 5.” Unfortunately the wheelchair service was terrible. Very disappointed!

Flew in from Frankfurt connecting in Philadelphia had a first class ticket with my husband went to the lounge problems getting in then waited 4 plus hours for flight to San Diego. Went to the gate and there seemed to be a problem they announced that they were having personnel issues waiting for a crew member to arrive - this was at 8pm (flight to leave at 8.25pm). Flight then cancelled and we were told to get a hotel and rescheduled the flight next day at 6pm no first class and had to pay $250 out of pocket to stay overnight. Next flight awful flight attendants rude sour. Will never fly US air again!

Kansas City to Seattle with a stop in Phoenix. On the day of my flight I got ready went to the airport and was helped by a lovely woman at the check in counter had no problems checking in my 2 bags and then went to wait for the plane. It was on time and ready to go had no issues with my carry on luggage and had a pleasant flight to Phoenix the staff member doing the intercom system was even showing us interesting things that were outside the window. Plane in Phoenix was on time as well the staff onboard were courteous and fun. My bags arrived to Seattle.

Flight ZRH-PHL on a 767. As noted in other comments those planes are very old with no individual in-flight entertainment modules in Economy class. The overhead monitors are just a few so unless you are seated close to them you need to have very good eyes to see what's going on selection of movies was pathetic. I am 6'3' but the seats were actually rather comfortable and roomy albeit worn out. Only complimentary alcohol is wine (from a carton?). Crew was polite although certain members did have a bit of an attitude. Overall US Airways will get you to your destination (often cheaply) which is what matters for most passengers.

### US Airways customer review
I've just come back from a 2 week trip to the US from Ireland. I bought return flights to Boston with a connection through Philadelphia. On arrival in Philadelphia (which is a hub for US Airways seemingly) our connection was cancelled with no notice to passengers waiting at the gate. 20 mins after the flight was due to go the sign above the gate was still saying 'On Time'. We were told initially that all other flights were booked out that evening except for another 6 hours later which had no guarantee's of leaving. Eventually exhausted we agreed to layover for the night in a nearby hotel on US Airways expense. We flew the next days 18 hrs late. On our return flight via Philadelphia we were delayed on the runway 2 hours in Boston and arrived in Philadelphia 5 mins before our connection was to leave. They never held back the flight even though a substantial number of flights from Boston that evening had a large number of people travelling on that flight. Again we had to layover for the night. It was 24 hrs later before we flew out. Amongst all of this mayhem we came across the most rudest uncaring and incompetent Customer representatives I've come across. I will never fly with this airline again.

### US Airways customer review
Quebec City to Philadelphia. The plane was late so several customers had to be rescheduled. It took 1 hour and 45 minutes to check in 17 customers. The ticket agents were steadily working but it seemed the system for that airport was either antiquated or they had difficulty receiving/sending current information. Not sure if the fault was with poorly trained agents or a lousy system but the wait time was inexcusable. Then once we (finally) got on the plane we were delayed another 20 minutes while the baggage handlers arranged and rearranged the luggage in the storage area below the cabin. That extra 20 minutes caused us to miss our connecting flight. Not a good experience.

### US Airways customer review
Flight from Boston to Charlotte delayed for weather a lot of passengers had a tight connection time. The staff made no effort for suggesting passengers who need connection to deboard first in order to catch the next flight. Had to spend a whole night waiting for the flight the next morning.

### US Airways customer review
Sky Harbor Phoenix to DFW this past Thursday. Flight crew were rude to passengers. We board the plane and taxi to the runway. After 20 minutes the pilot announces that due to electrical malfunctions we would be returning to the gate to allow maintenance onboard. This seemed understandable. Once we returned to the gate they opened the plane doors. After 15 minutes both pilots exited the plane. I took this opportunity to grab my cell phone to send a text message to my husband who would be picking me up. A flight attendant immediately turned and yelled at me and said that I was not allowed to have my cell phone on. I am a frequent business traveler and even have a flight scheduled for week after next. I am cancelling the flight perfectly willing to pay a cancellation fee and I will never fly this airline again.

Flew from JFK-CLT-LGA. First flight was good overall except baggage was very slow to be returned. Return flight flight attendants seemed a bit clueless and my tray table was broken (it was an older aircraft but still.) Not a bad airline but not my first choice in any scenario.

The flight from check in to the actual flight experience was good the seats where okay the crew were polite served drinks respond quickly to needs. Boarding was fast from Charlotte to Houston return flight was lovely and the crew were excellent. The inflght entertainment is rubbish so come with your ipad loaded with music or movies. 757-200 are old planes used for the Dublin-Charlotte route apart from that I will use them for the right price.

US Airways called me about 5 minutes before I was going to get to the airport for PHL-SDF flight. Told that my flight was canceled. They offered my wife and I tickets to Indianapolis but no connecting flight to Louisville. The next flight was 21.30 (9 hours after the original to SDF). Flight was 45 minutes late taking off. Gates changed 3 times without notice given to passengers and departure board was not updated.

LHR-CLT-SRQ-CLT-LAS. Envoy class LHR-CLT on A330-300 very good. Full flight in both classes. Boarded on time but delayed takeoff due to congestion arrival CLT on time. Seats comfortable with a good view out of the windows in row A on a 1x2x1 configuration. Food very good and unusual for me ate all courses offered. Inflight snack bar available. Staff friendly and helpful. Charlotte airport excellent for USA arrival through immigration customs bags onto SRQ and in the lounge within 40 minutes. A lot better than LAX at 3 hours plus. CLT-Sarasota and back on US Express both on time and again good crew. Ground staff also very helpful. CLT-Las Vegas on an A321 again full flight no entertainment but food OK again. Only mentioned the credit cards on this flight but not too pushy. Priority bags delivered first on all flights. Overall a very good experience to counter all the negative ones.

MAN-PHL-LAS on 8th May and SFO-PHL-MAN on 26th May. Transatlantic legs in A330 much better than domestic segments by A320 within the USA. Food onboard in long haul fine served a glass of wine for free if requested which is an improvement. Breakfast tasty if only lacking in quantity. On 5 hour domestic flights only water and 1 non alcoholic drink served plus coffee/snack on outbound. Effectively operates a no frills model domestically even if you travel on a transatlantic ticket. They should issue free vouchers at least for people travelling long haul although no charge for checked bags on such ticket. AVOD installed on transatlantic temperamental but did work and headsets now free. Would not pay a premium to fly this carrier but as price paid for an open jaw return significantly lower than more premium carrier options was worth doing. All check in queues quite short made to use self service at SFO but system could not find our reservation and had to see agent anyway. Some staff are good at their jobs others going through the motions particularly on domestic leg. This is an average airline nothing special but if schedules and pricing acceptable would use again.

US airways cancelled my first flight from Boston to Philadelphia (connecting in Philly to go to Richmond) while I was on my way to the airport. When they gave me my new flight the next day they did not put my brother and I next to each other when our seats were together on the original flight (seats next to each other were available on the flight). When we made it to Philadelphia the next day they cancelled our flight to Richmond and had to schedule again! Customer service were good at putting us on the new flight but flying this airline is a gamble.

### US Airways customer review
Flew PHL to SJU return. US Airways use a 757 that was originally configured to fly the transatlantic routes on some of these services. The seats were proper old-style business class cradle type with great leg room and plenty of recline. Service excellent. Food good. No in-flight entertainment on either sector. Would definitely choose US Airways on this route if they continue using their 757s with the ex-long haul configuration. Both flights on-time.

### US Airways customer review
I had a miserable experience and customer service has been worthless. Our flight was delayed for over 4 hours due to auxiliary power failure. After 4 hours they took off even though nothing was fixed. Dealing with customer service is pointless - they don't know anything and just give you canned response. I will never fly them again.

LHR-PHL and PHL-LHR. Absolutely no complaints. On-time. Excellent seat in envoy class. Friendly service and good food. Wines not as good as BA and no Champagne pre-take off or in-flight only sparkling Italian Prosecco. Lounge in PHL inferior to BA's but US Airways use the Star Alliance lounge at LHR which is good. Would use again if the price was right.

Flight 38 (LAX to CLT) this past week. My sister who was visiting from out of country had her flight delayed because of some issue with the cabin crew and almost missed her connecting flight. Her baggage was delivered on a later flight to our hotel which was the least they could do. Our customer service rep was very professional and helpful in assisting us. US Airways is a great way to fly on a budget but they need to fix issues like this or no amount of value can make it up.

### US Airways customer review
Seat 24F Flight 1471. The seats in back are made for people who are less than 5" tall and 120lbs. They install the seat so that your shoulder is up against the window panel which shoves you into the person next to you. You cant recline the seat and it is installed cockeyed so that your back knows you are tilted forward the whole ride long. I am glad it was only for an hour or so. People in front of me chimed in about sitting on top of one another. Paid for preferred access and watched the TSA line move like lightning while preferred access stood there like idiots paying for a service that is non existent. When you try to upgrade a seat to first class you loose the $ for the first upgrade. Fix that seat so it is flat and not tilting forward.

3/4 of my scheduled flights had serious issues. 4th flight I didn't take - my husband and I opted to take a rental car. First flight was taxiing to the runway we went back to the gate and changed flights. Replacement plane was fine. Connecting flight delayed due to a problem with the fuelling truck and then had an aborted take-off. We had to wait over an hour until they put us on a different plane at the opposite end of the airport. On the returning flight from Cancun we were notified mid-air over the Atlantic that there was some kind of electrical issue and that we had to make a cautionary landing in Miami. We were in Miami on a hot plane for 3 hours. Flight attendants did not check on us. They didn't come by with water. We had to go get it from the back where they were filing cups. Finally we left again and were served 2 tiny cookies. We of course missed our connecting flight in Philly. They threw a voucher at us for a hotel 15 miles away. By that point everything in the airport was closed in regards to food and we had nothing to eat all day. We tried calling customer service only to be told repeatedly that they have no phone support for such issues.

### US Airways customer review
Recent experience on YYZ-PHL-CDG-PHL-YYZ was awful. Ignoring luggage issues on both in and outbound flights the ground service and scheduling were terrifying. Confirmed flights were cancelled or rescheduled without notice (email or text messages were received after the fact) gates were changed an average of 3x per flight all flights delayed (in some cases cancelled altogether) - my wife an I ended up on separate flights! - and departure information was inconsistent - i.e. big electronic display says flight gate F33 at 7.10pm little concourse display says gate F27 at 5.35pm and actual gate sign says 6.35pm and attendant says "Oh the displays aren't updated very often". The overall experience - coming and going - was flabbergasting. It's hard to understand how an organization can be so broken. I think what startled me the most is that the ground staff had so little regard for the degree in which they were trashing people's schedules vacations honeymoons etc. In fairness I'll say that the actual flight (once we got on one) was fine - nothing special but nothing horrible either - but getting to the flight transferring between flights luggage handling luggage problem handling responsiveness to client's was just plain horrible verging on criminal.

I am long time US flyer with over 326000 miles earned on this airline I know the airline and its product and policies well and I must say I will do everything I can to never fly USAir (or American if the post-merger product is anything like USAir) again. Staff on long haul international flights (PHL-LHR) and (LHR-PHL) are not only rude and unprofessional they seem to have disdain for their customers. One does not expect personalized attention in Economy but even in this class of service this was still a $1400 ticket and quite frankly I expect better service for that kind of money. Multiple requests to have a personal wheelchair stored in the cabin coat closet (as every other international airline does) were ignored on not one but 3 separate occasions. Disabled passengers and mothers with infants were treated with complete disdain on both US Airways Flight 728 (5/17/13) and US Airways flight 729 (5/20/13). I fly frequently and am generally pretty tolerant of the hassles of flying nowadays however flying on US Airways between the US and Europe was truly the low point of my trip. The fact that both the outbound and the return flights were characterized by such poorly trained staff tells me this is an endemic problem. Their international product truly is garbage no matter what the fare is.

Was scheduled to fly from NY to Orlando for my first child's graduation. Flight from NY was rescheduled due to mechanical problem. Rescheduled to fly from NY to Philadelphia connecting to another flight from Philadelphia to Orlando arrived in Philadelphia while awaiting at the gate They closed the doors never asked me anything were very unpleasant to deal with and after complaining they finally rescheduled me for another flight that was late to Orlando which resulted in me being late for my Daughters graduation. When I spoke with someone on the phone all I got was a run-around and how sorry they truly are but there is nothing we can. Supervisor after supervisor nobody was willing to make the experience even a little pleasant.

When I did my online check-in it asked me if I wanted to upgrade to First Class for $300. I have travelled to East Asia (China) a couple times - first time I flew coach - 3 seats wide. After the 12 hour flight home I promised myself I would never do that again. The next time went to China on United I upgraded to Business Class - wow what a difference - lay flat seats are what traveling that distance was meant to be. I upgraded my wife and myself to first class for the 6 hour flight. US Air flies a old 757 to Honolulu but I will say for me the $300 was well worth it. The seats are the old school First Class seats big "lazy boy" style which recline maybe 10-degrees and no foot rest but very comfy and roomy. No duvets or pillows like business class to China but normal aircraft pillow and blanket sufficed for me. Hot meal service was fine - served on glass plates - two choices (chicken or ravioli) - airplane food - United business class to China had excellent food - this was more one step up from a TV dinner but sufficed. Ice cream for desert. After dinner had a nice nap and awoke to a basket of all kinds of snacks being passed out. Plenty of drinks readily available. So was it worth $300 each for wife and I to upgrade to first class? Yes but if upgrading means you are going to have to cutback on your spending once you get to Hawaii - definitely wouldn't recommend that. Hope upgrades are available for my flight home! Tip: if you can get seats in 2F and 2 D these are bulkhead and more leg room and the shared TV is on the wall in front of you.

This is the first and last time I'll fly with US Air. The delays are ridiculous. I've never seen an airline with so many problems with their planes. Both flights I took to go stateside were delayed and both returning were also delayed. I missed my last connection. I have recently returned from another trip using Southwest. What a difference.

The only reason we took US Airways was because they had a non-stop to Punta Cana from Philadelphia. They charge you $25 for your luggage and lost my daughter's. We came back 5/14/13 she just got it today 5/16/13. The seats were hard and there wasn't any entertainment. It has to be the cheapest airline going. They asked if anyone wanted bottle water I said yes they gave me a Dixie cup of water. When he served me my soda he spilt it on me and didn't even say he was sorry!

Flew from San Juan to Philadelphia connecting to Los Angeles LAX. This airline deserves to go down to the ranks of Ryanair and one star less. The PHL Agents are the most bored staff in the USA and service onboard long haul Caribbean and transcon flights limited on one and only one beverage service and that's it. What do FA's the rest of the flight? Southwest just entered service into SJU from MCO/TPA/BWI and FLL and flights are extremely full. Will avoid US Airways at all costs even if the fare at another airline is higher.

My recent domestic flight was so unpleasant. Late departures on all 4 legs of my trip. On last flight departing Philadelphia the gate staff were rude disorganized and apparently poorly trained. One member of the gate team showed a complete lack of compassion for a very young mother traveling alone with her infant. Body language displayed toward this young lady was deplorable. Seat was comfortable - looked to have been recently refurbished. Poor application of carry-on luggage policies travelers carrying over-sized bags and 3+ items were completely ignored. Seriously reconsidering my airline options for future travel.

The worst flying experience with a lack of customer service to accompany it. I waited over 4 hours to take flight on one of their planes and over 2 hours on another that was eventually cancelled while we were aboard the plane. All of this happened during one international flight. I had connecting flights for what should have been 4 flights (2 there 2 back) every single plane was late. Nothing was offered. Overall just not my cup of tea. I will never fly that airline again!

US Airways Philadelphia-Athens Economy Class. Just awful. But that was to be expected. US still flies ancient 767s on this route. Probably the worst transatlantic carrier around today. No entertainment system (they couldn't even get the shared TV right with movies being cut off half way and replaced with a new one) seats were old and visibly broken. I had planned to work on the flight when I discovered that my reading light was broken I was simply informed that I should have told the staff before we took off. Typical rude and unprofessional attitude that I have come to expect from the airline. No loss seeing them leave Star Alliance.

### US Airways customer review
Last year I flew across the United States 28 times for work as well as flights to other parts of the US. I saw over 15 airports and flew in coach and first class (once my status got up to Gold I flew first class almost every week). I never had a cancelled flight or a missed connection and I was never more than 30 minutes late to my destination. Sometimes the flights were annoying but that was because of other passengers not the staff. My only complaint about US Air is that they don't have the extra legroom seats like United so you are forced to try to grab exit rows or pray for a bump to first class.

MAD-PHL and return. Overall good. Both planes on time. First leg plenty of empty spaces so you can stretch. Main meal average but last minute pastrami sandwich quite tasty. Good selection of movies and music system a bit low at times. Nice crew. No lost baggage. Second leg full plane dinner ok breakfast a bit poor: muffin and coffee or juice. I didn't have to pay for the headphones. Toilets well maintained all flight long. I would fly with them again.

I flew out of DTW to PHL at 9.30am but received an automated call at 9am stating that my connection from PHL to PIT was cancelled. Then on my way home I had a 2 hour layover in DCA. I noticed that every flight but 1 scheduled from 3.30pm to 6pm were delayed due to 'maintenance'. I'm still sitting at the airport an hour after my scheduled departure time with no updates on my flight status. Needless to say I should have driven home.
