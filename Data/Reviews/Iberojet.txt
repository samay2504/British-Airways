### "Terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. Our flight was scheduled to leave San José at 19:40 (7:40pm) but only departed at 21:03 (9:03pm) so 1 hour and 20 minutes delay. We arrived in Madrid at 14:30 (2:30pm) but only got out of the plane by 14:55 (2:55pm). This meant that we missed our connection flight to Lisbon that departed at 15:00 (3pm). The airline did not take any responsibility for this although they were the only responsible for the delay. The plane staff did not help us at all after we explained several times our problem and our concerns with missing our connection. They did not even try to make our lives easier a little bit. The result of all of this was an 8 hours wait in Madrid and 130€ EACH for a new plane ticket to Lisbon. The food is terrible, the leg room is terrible (had more legroom in the last minute Easy Jet flight that booked). Overall terrible experience, don't recommend and personally won't ever fly with them.
