### "I was apparently 10 minutes late"
This was my first and worst experience with Malindo Air. I encountered check-in problems both online and at the self-service kiosks, which already caused unnecessary stress. When I approached the staff for help, I was told to go to the counter only to be refused assistance because I was apparently 10 minutes late. I arrived at the counter around 8:35–8:40 AM for a 9:35 AM flight, and yet the staff informed me I should’ve been there before 8:30 AM. What makes this worse is the fact that the flight ended up being delayed and only took off at around 10:15 AM. This experience showed a real lack of customer care and flexibility.

### “This is ridiculous”
First time and will be the last time flying on this flight. Booked a 09:30 flight but still waiting for the flight even at 13:30. This is ridiculous. I would rather pay more than having my 2yo baby to wake up early just to wait in the airport for 5 hours. Better pick AirAsia, Scoot or Citilink.

### “waste of money and service”
Not Verified | Serious waste of money and service. So late departure at 6.55 pm. Flight kick off at 8.35pm. Better I can take late hours flight rather than at 6.55pm. Seriously unprofessional at all. All other flight can kick off on time what’s wrong with this flight.

### “Friendly attentive staff”
My first time flying with Malindo (now Batik Air). Fabulous experience, smooth checkin, luggage included. Friendly attentive staff. Much more comfortable seats that either Air Asia or Jetstar. Good pricing. I have already booked another 2 flights. Impressive economy airline. 5 ⭐️ for the price you pay.

### “don't expect any luxurious features”
I recently had the opportunity to fly with Batik Air Malaysia and my experience was a mix of satisfaction and simplicity. Batik Air is known for providing basic services without the frills, and it certainly lived up to that reputation. The seating arrangements on the plane were comfortable, but don't expect any luxurious features. The seats were standard with enough legroom for a short to medium-haul flight. However, the absence of in-flight entertainment and limited amenities made the journey quite straightforward. For those who prioritize a no-fuss travel experience, this may be a positive aspect. One notable issue was the apparent lack of thoroughness in the cabin crew's safety checks during the landing phase. It was concerning to observe that the crew did not seem as attentive as one would expect in ensuring that all passengers were securely seated and that all items were stowed away properly. The usual announcements and visual checks were noticeably absent, creating a sense of unease among passengers. Safety is paramount in air travel, and any oversight during critical phases of the flight, such as landing, is a cause for concern. It is imperative that the cabin crew conducts meticulous checks to guarantee the well-being of passengers. This lack of attention to detail on Batik Air raises questions about the airline's commitment to ensuring a safe travel experience.

### "would not recommend"
Worst experience with Malindo Airline (Batik Airline). They scheduled our flight without any notification. We know on Malaysian airport that out flight has been rescheduled from Malaysia to Nepal. don’t know what is a actual issue but they just said technical issue to us, the flight was cancelled from Malaysia to Kathmandu, and our transit time increased from 3 hours to 17 hours. We were around 12 passengers. Initially, they made a drama about providing accommodation, but after more than half an hour discussion, they finally gave us food and accommodation. And in morning I knew that there way more than 5 Nepalese passengers, they didn’t get any accommodation or facilities. I would not recommend Malindo Air or Batik Air based on this experience. And the service was OMG can’t able to explain.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. They don’t give you food or water. You can’t even buy on plane. Service were terrible. Plane has no Tv monitor or charging station. Seats are really bad but you still pay lot of money.

### "Disappointed with the service"
Disappointed with the service from the airline. First after touch down in Kuala Lumpur, we waiting for our baggage to be on belt for one hour. And when asked the ground staff, no answer was given and they are not sure was is happening. After going home with our luggage, during unpacking, realised that our luggage cracked. Have been traveling for so many times, this was the first time we encounter this problem.

### "refused to give me a refund"
Not Verified |  I was originally scheduled to fly from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Due to operational constraints Malindo cancelled the flight and put me on flight the next day, which would be useless for me as I was attending a family wedding and would be reaching after the wedding is over. They refused to give me a refund but instead gave me a credit which is really unbelievable. when I called customer service they refused to give me a refund for an issue that was entirely Malindo's.

### "crew made a good first impression"
I didn't have high expectations from Malindo Air but despite this my flight was a disappointment on various fronts. New Year's Eve is not a busy time to fly and as expected the flight was only 60% full. The crew made a good first impression but the flaws started appearing early in the flight. Both lavatories had not a drop of soap in them and the crew confirmed they have no soap at all. The temperature inside the cabin was very cold and if this wasn't bad enough the air conditioning was blowing at full force. This was true even once we landed and waited to disembark. The onboard meals are reasonably priced but they come with only one a 350 ml water. The menu doesn't display prices for water bottles (only soft drinks) The cabin was clean and the crew provides good service.

### "this issue remains unsolved after 4 months plus"
Their customer service is non-existent. When tickets were purchased in July for my upcoming trip end of Dec 2022, my credit card charge vs tax invoice received did not match. They did not send me tax invoices for extra luggage. Since their e-ticket does not have any luggage info, I wanted the receipt. Numerous emails & calls to customer service, this issue remains unsolved after 4 months plus. I finally had to dispute charges through my credit card company. My kids are coming later on the same airline & the departure time has changed twice. This is impacting our bookings in KL. I tried to call them & was on hold for 2 hours & no one picked up. I finally hung up. After reading all the reviews, I pray we will actually depart as stated.

### "Very bad experience"
Very bad experience. Flight schedule keep changing when your flight is nearby and the they don’t want to listen you. Never get any emails reply and they don’t provide any refund. So be careful before choosing this airlines.

### "They have zero care for passengers"
Not Verified |  Unreliable. Regret traveling with them. Flight got cancelled 4 days before, due to operational requirements. I had their travel insurance, which doesn’t cover that. They have zero care for passengers. They send me another ticket with missing connection flight. Their customer care never picked up the phone. I literally went to airport counter and got another ticket and ended up 14 hour transit time at KLIA airport. Try avoid flying with them and never buy their insurance. It’s a joke. Covers nothing.

### "changed my flight time without reason,"
Malindo Air has changed my flight time without reason, I call back many time service center, it not pick up and failure system setting. Then I email 6x urgent email to recall me back. From my last experience, it take 1 month to reply which i already done travelling. No reply, no answer. It seems that the air ticket just burn out like that? .

### "flight was changed one full day"
Not Verified |  Totally unreliable! The return flight was changed one full day, as if it doesn't cost anything to stay another night in KL. Then the time of return flight has changed back and forth twice. Come on? During the flight the staff does not really enforce the mask mandate. I won't fly with Batik/Malindo anymore.

### "Recommend using another airline"
Not Verified | Perth to Kuala Lumpur. Malindo cancelled our return flight KL to Perth at short notice causing us 4 days additional hotel, food and extra leave from unhappy employers, who served verbal notice. Malindo's response they don’t care, no compensation for our losses. Recommend using another airline

### "Refund requests submitted but ignored"
Not Verified |  Purchased $2200 of fares to Bali before Malindo ceased Australian operations. Refund requests submitted but ignored. When pushed, they will promise to process but they then go to ground and ignore you.

### "Only advice is don't book any flights with this company!"
Not Verified |  Because of the pandemic, our trip/flights to Bali was cancelled by the company. They dont give any money back but give travel vouchers. Anyway, we are now in a position to rebook our trips. The voucher says we have till the 20th May to rebook. I tried to rebook on the 12 May and entered the Travel voucher number only to be told that these vouchers had been used already! I have emailed Malindo in the past and it usually takes them a month to reply so it looks like we have lost our money! Over $1000 lost! No point trying to ring them as others say they cant get through! Only advice is don't book any flights with this company!

### "not fly this airline again"
I was supposed to board a 3.50pm flight today and it was delayed until 8.50pm. Sms told covid restriction by MKN. Really mad. How come you delay a flight to such a long period and it is only fly locally. Keep your promise. Very bad service. Not even a complimentary voucher meal given to your passenger. Will not fly this airline again.

### "regret not sticking to the competitor"
flown many times with Malindo. Generally not great and not terrible. This trip im extremely disappointed with Malindo. Our mid morning flight was cancelled and changed to 8:30 am. Then 3 days before flight, it was changed to 7 pm. Basically our whole day has been destroyed. I thought I’d help Malindo by flying them but now regret not sticking to the competitor.

### "Is this legal to hold our money"
I had booked my air ticket with Malindo Air and my journey date was 03 May 2020. The flight was cancelled from Malindo side stating the reason for covid. it has been more than 1-1/2 years now and when contacted to Malindo air in October 2021, they replied to my email that the Malindo flights are not operational from Kuala Lumpur to any part of India. Is this legal to hold our money and be in mercy of Malindo. There are bubble flights operational with other flights (Air Asia etc) and I need to travel urgently to India. I have asked for refund via email communication but the email reply / process from Malindo side is very slow.

### "I would not trust them not to cancel again"
This airline should be thoroughly ashamed of its policies and customer service. I went direct to the airline at much more expense thinking booking direct would be a safer option. Within a day of receiving my booking and money they sent me an email bringing the flight forward by 2 hours. The next day they sent me an email cancelling the flight altogether and offering me a flight the next day due to operational reasons. When I contacted them, they informed me that they would only issue a voucher not a refund. I cannot use this voucher and had to book another airline to get to my connecting flight. This is totally outrageous as they cancelled the flight and cannot provide the service that was paid for. So they just keep everyone’s money and hope that you can’t use the voucher. The voucher is totally useless to me and in light of their behavior with this last flight even if I could use the voucher I would not trust them not to cancel again. Travel is stressful enough as it is in the pandemic, but to refuse to give a refund when the cancellation is totally the fault of the airline is just plain wrong.

### "over a year later - no refund"
My flight was cancelled. I was offered a voucher but declined - they don't fly enough routes I'd want to use. Eventually they agreed to a refund (after many emails). Since then I've chased every month. I keep being told it's being passed to another department for payment but over a year later - no refund.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The travel voucher refund is very long to receive. Only received a year after I requested it. If not because of the travel voucher, I wont use this airline anymore. Not worth your money at all. Customer service also very bad. Didn't reply to customer's email, if you didn't call to ask about the email, they won't reply to it and respond to it. Too many times the flight was cancelled but they didn't help at all to assist to get the new flight date. Customer call centre also very hard to reach. I called hundred times but too hard to answer. You cannot call using your mobile phone because cannot press "1" or "2" to choose English or Bahasa. Email didnt respond, call cannot reached - the worst airline ever!

### "Consistent lying and unforeseen delays"
Not Verified |  Worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Flight cancelled in early March 2020. Cannot seem to get a refund after months of emails and phone calls. Consistent lying and unforeseen delays, I believed this excuse at the beginning but it has been over a year now and really don't believe this is a legitimate airline.

### "They replied back and said no money will be refunded"
I booked flights for myself and my wife in 6th Jan 2020 with Malindo Air to take us from India to Perth via Malaysia on 23 April 2020 but due to covid the flights were cancelled. I filled out the Refund request form straight away but it kept crashing, eventually after a week it went through. I hadn't heard anything back so I emailed customer services on 22nd April and heard nothing so I emailed again on 4th May and again 14th May and still had no reply. I then found they had a Facebook page so I messaged the page on 18th May and they replied to say they had passed the message onto the relevant department. Having heard nothing back I messaged them again on 31st May, they replied on 1st June and said my refund was being processed and I just needed to wait. I waited until 17th June and messaged again, this time they replied and said they were going to escalate it. Finally 23rd June they messaged back to say they were doing my refund via a voucher to be used on flights and valid for 12 months. I replied straight back and explained that I do not intend to fly in the next 12 month or even longer and that I wanted my money returned, not a voucher. They replied back and said no money will be refunded. As you can imagine with covid 19 I'm not in a hurry to go abroad and I need the money refunded as I'm currently unable to work.

### "Malindo Air has turned into an absolute nightmare"
Not Verified |  Malindo Air has turned into an absolute nightmare of an airline due to my experience today. I was supposed to be on a flight today on Malindo Air, but unfortunately without even an email, phone call or any sort of alert, my flight was cancelled. We spent so much time and effort packing the whole day and driving to the airport which felt like hours to have found out my flight had been cancelled. Lets not forget I had to do a Covid Test which was expensive as heck and now I'll have to do it again. Just never fly from here if you don't want disappointment and problems in your life.

### "Still have not heard back"
Malindo Air cancelled our flights due to COVID-19 requested a refund or vouchers in April. Still have not heard back. Have sent multiple emails to customer service and they keep saying that they have forwarded them on to the correct department. Then nothing. Just want email back confirming they are processing them. Not sure how you can rate them if they didn’t fly you anywhere.

### "hire to create the problem"
Today I just received an email about my flight cancel and without given you option then direct replace to another fight which almost 3 hours later from the original schedule. So I sure I can’t accept as  I am going to miss an important meeting if I accept the new schedule flight. So I call to customer care to make complaint and hope can solve the problem. But one girl try to challenge me said that when you booked the flight you must to accept our flight cancellation policy. Customer care is to solve customer problem but she seem like is hire to create the problem and challenge the customer.

### "never fly by this airline again"
Not Verified | We had booked 2 tickets for Perth to Kolkata & return from Kolkata to Perth. Malindo cancelled the Perth to Kolkata flight & offered another one after 2 days which we did not take as we had booked for a short stay in India & did not want to waste our days. So we went by Thai Airways instead. But while coming back we kept the ticket & came back to Perth with Malindo. They have issued us travel vouchers for the unutilized part of our ticket which do not cover the price we paid for our ticket. Also I paid more for my ticket(25 KG baggage charge) than my husbands (20KG baggage charge). But I have got less refund amount on my voucher than my husbands. I complained to them several times by sending detailed emails & calling multiple times but after 3 months my problem is still not solved. Every time a new person answers the phone or a new person deals with the email & they do not bother to go deep in the matter & give stupid replies which is very frustrating. They do not even have a toll free no. One of the customer representative emailed me that the refund amount should be $355.99 which pertained to my husband's ticket. But the actual travel voucher amounts are $340.89 & for my voucher it is $$338.39 which does not make any sense. We will never fly by this airline again.

### "This is disgusting"
We paid $842 for 2 return flights from Brisbane to Bali for my birthday in July. After Covid-19 hit and travel was restricted, we applied for a refund as my husband has a lung condition so is at high risk if he catches the infection. We explained we would be unable to travel until a vaccine was available and that travel vouchers would be of no use to us. After waiting 2 months, we tried to call the Australian office but it had been closed. We emailed customer care and 2 hours later we received an email reply containing 2 travel vouchers for $152.72 each which need to be re booked by May 2021. We are told these were sale priced tickets which are non refundable and that we can only get back the Australian taxes we would have paid for this flight. This is disgusting, it was not our fault that the pandemic had forced these restrictions! For a company to take our hard earned money, be unable to provide a service and only offer such a pitiful amount on useless travel vouchers we will be unable to redeem in time, is shameful and theft. Travel insurance wont cover this and we are forced to to complain to the Malaysian consumer complaints commission in an attempt to recoup our loss. They should not be allowed to get away with taking peoples money for nothing.

### "my emails have been ignored"
Not Verified |  My ticket was cancelled due to the Covid-19 outbreak and I was asked to submit a refund application. It has now been 4 months all of my emails have been ignored and I am not receiving any response or status as to what is happening. At this point I have accepted the fact that I have been cheated and scammed.

### "Poor in every possible aspect"
Not Verified |  April flight from Brisbane to Denpasar cancelled by airline in March. Full refund requested upon notice of cancellation, however got absolutely nowhere after several emails. Currently I have been palmed off to the 'AU Team' who have failed to respond to several emails for nearly 2 weeks now. Not holding my breath for a refund but will never do business with the airline again. Poor in every possible aspect.

### "good value for money"
Not Verified |  Malacca to Penang. Nice little airline from Malaysia. The short flight on this ATR 72-600 wasn´t bad. No wifi or any entertainment. Very nice food served there. Overall good value for money!

### "Disgusting experience"
Not Verified |  Disgusting experience - do not book a flight with this airline. Prior to the Covid-19 being declared a pandemic, Malindo decided they were no longer going to fly this route so cancelled the flight. I requested a refund and was told we needed to wait 30 days for this to clear. After numerous phone calls, emails and a wait of approx. 50 days we were issued with a credit note - to be used within 6 months. They cancelled, not us - therefore we are entitled to a full refund. Their 'customer care line' (the joke is in the title as there is zero care!) hung up when I called chasing my refund. I was told for 5 weeks I would be receiving a refund to my credit card but they then issued a credit note to be used during a pandemic! Do yourself a huge favour and book elsewhere.

### "refund as a travel voucher"
I was meant to fly to Bali on April 22, 2020 but, of course due to Covid-19, the flight was cancelled by Malindo Air. I emailed them immediately to get a refund and since then my customer service experience has been a nightmare. First they took over a week to respond, only to send a generic email redirecting me to a form I needed to fill out requesting the refund. At no point leading up to this (or written anywhere on the form) did they inform me that the refund would be given in the form of a travel voucher. So, I filled the form out and waited for my refund that would never come. 22 days passed without hearing anything. During this time I emailed them twice to no reply. Finally, after my 3rd email (in which I requested a personal response specific to my situation and request), I received another generic response telling me that my request had been processed and I will be receiving my refund as a travel voucher. I replied saying that this is unacceptable and again asked for a cash refund in accordance with their policy. Once more, after a week of waiting, I received yet another generic email back explaining that their policy actually states that refunds are given in the form of vouchers and that under no circumstances would cash refunds be given. Furthermore, I was advised that I would only have 6 months to use the voucher from date of issue. After looking into this further, I found that Malindo changed their refund policy on March 17 of this year. This is after they must have realized that travel would be shutting down, they would have to start cancelling flights on their end and refunding money to their customers, this is downright despicable. I urge anyone considering using this airline because their flights look cheaper: don't. It's not worth the headache and frustration if for some reason you're unable to travel or your flight gets cancelled by the airline itself.

### "Poor service, poorer customer service"
Not Verified |  If I could give any airline a 0/10, this would be it. I'm a very frequent traveller and my only advice for this would be don't even bother with this airline, regardless of the price. Poor service, poorer customer service and truly an example of how a company acts in bad faith. I submitted a request for refund in accordance with the terms and conditions stated on their website after my flights were cancelled and tried to call their customer service hotline to no success. One month later I am informed that they are issuing me my refund in the form of a voucher in accordance with their refund policy which was changed recently without notifying customers. Had to wait another 2 weeks to get any response from them on my further questions and the staff were completely unhelpful. Be warned, this is truly a scam airlines and their terms are so badly drafted you're forced to go into details to build your argument (also I note that they sneakily fail to include the effective date of their terms on the website so you can't tell when they update - thank heavens for screenshots and pdfs). Not worth any price if you asked me.

### "airline is not worthy of business"
Penang to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur. Malindo Air changes the timings of the first flight (I accept changes happen) which makes the connection in Kuala Lumpur impossible. After many tries to contact Malindo Air I finally get as far as having the ticket changed and leaving from Penang instead as there were no other options. I am still puzzled by the fact that a booking system can rebook me on a flight that arrives 30 minutes later than my connection departs? And that I have have to point this out to the airline. On 2 occasions? A month later they also change the flight times (once again I accept changes happen) and I am back yet again sending numerous mails and messages via messenger. Since there are no there alternatives or options they offer to refund my ticket I even get a confirmation saying they will refund this ticket. 2 months later I get an email saying that due to the corona virus I be reimbursed in vouchers valid for 6 months. The cancellations had nothing to do with corona - all flights were flown and before any alterations to the industry/tourism etc in Malaysia as well as Thailand. Vouchers to be used in Asia within 6 months. I live in Denmark and the world is closed. Seriously? Sadly they are no longer responding to my mails. It is impossible to speak to anyone in charge yet alone finding the name of someone who can manage anything but sending a standard mail. And this is Business class ? This airline is not worthy of business I am afraid.

### "sending me a travel voucher"
I had my flight Taipei to Kuala Lumpur booked on 15 March 2020. Unfortunately, it was canceled because of operational requirement. I was informed on 2 March 2020. Quickly, I submitted a refund request to them on 6 March 2020. On 10 April 2020, they compensated my by sending me a travel voucher, where I would need to claim it at their sales counter in Taiwan within six months! I checked their website, then only I found out that they have changed their refund policy, effective from 17 March 2020. More importantly, my flight was canceled not because of COVID-19 outbreak but due to their requirement. Think twice if you wanted to get their service, I hope you wouldn't experience the frustration I have with this pathetic airline.

### "The most uncomfortable seat and reduced leg room"
Not Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Perth. Low cost/no frills - that's OK. However: 1) Malindo performed their own carry on security check prior to boarding - did not allow any personal water for the 6 hour flight. Consequently, water would need to be purchased on board at an inflated price. 2) The most uncomfortable seat and reduced leg room of any flight taken anywhere. In retrospect, would have chosen to pay more for a more comfortable flight.

### "most uncomfortable seats"
Not Verified | Denpasar to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. Previous 6-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur to Perth: most uncomfortable seats ever - narrow seats with minimal leg room! No charge for carry-ons. Water confiscated by Malindo security [3rd security check-in airport]. Consequently, water would need to be purchased onboard at an inflated price. A four-hour flight from Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur: charged us $179.00 for two checked bags [for total weight]. The seats, however, were more comfortable than on the 6-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur to Perth!

### "inappropriate and totally unfair"
Not Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi. Today we tried to cancel flights for this weekend to Langkawi due to the latest Movement Restriction Order in Malaysia. We live at Genting Highlands and the Government is telling everyone to remain at home to help stop the spread of Covid-19. Malindo Air only offered to give back approximately 80rm on tickets which were purchased for approximately 1200rm. Given the crisis the world is facing at present I believe this is inappropriate and totally unfair that Malindo Air are not supporting the government’s orders on the current restrictions.

### "Pathetic customer service"
Jakarta to Kochi via Kuala Lumpur. Pathetic customer service. They cancelled our flight from to Kochi and even not ready to tell us other options. Not even helping to get transit visa to board another airline. Pathetic and poor customer service and even flying experience is too bad.

### "recommend this airline"
Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. I recommend this airline. Spacious seat, clan aircraft, flight was smooth and comfortable. Only one minus - small portion of purchased meal

### "will never fly this airline again"
Sydney to Bali. I received an email a week before from Malindo airlines, changing my return journey by 3 days. With no alternative but to rearrange my entire holiday. Their customer service was appalling as they had no idea as to what they could offer customers like me in distress. I will never fly with this airline ever again and I still don't know what I'm going to do with my flights.

### "worse airline I've experienced"
Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. This is the worse airline I've experienced. I wanted to change/cancel my flight, called the service centre but it seems she was no help. She made matter more confusing and she gave me the wrong info. But to make matter worse, i got my luggage damage, try to file a complain, but they said i got no insurance so nothing cant be done. I understand that part, but i had to travel far back and forth to the lost and found department, holding my heavy luggage, without any offer to help me carry them.

### "ridiculous luggage policy"
Kochi to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. Absolutely ridiculous luggage policy! Airline wanted to charge us $500 for one bag (30000 Indian rupees / 15 kilo) during the checkin process, even though we had already paid 10 kilos before checking in (6 months prior to travel). Even worse, we tried to purchase the additional luggage the same day through the website and the servers didn’t allow us to complete the purchase. We eventually had to upgrade to business (to Kuala Lumpur) to take the bag at a rate of $260 for the upgrade. In addition to that, the Customer support service over the phone was poor. Many disconnects. Had to wait over 30 minutes and call back at least 5 times when we were purchasing the 10 kilos in advance. I will request a refund for the $260 charge.

### "empty seats made for a comfortable flight"
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. The only trouble was at boarding, where despite having checked in online and told to go straight to the gate, I was held up for document check and have a paper boarding pass printed. Plane departed on time and arrived 20 minutes early. Plenty of empty seats made for a comfortable flight, though aircon was a bit too cold.

### "baggage policy is ridiculous"
Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. This is the worst airline I have ever seen. Their baggage policy is ridiculous. During their online-check-in, there is no option to add additional checkin luggage. Once you have checked-in then, they only allow you to add luggage at a price that is ludicrous (around 14 AUD per Kilo, which is ~7/8 EUR). Talking to the customer service hotline, there is no way to reverse your check-in or add luggage (even if it’s couple days before departure), so you’re forced to pay their luggage pricing. If you are traveling with Malindo make sure that you add luggage at the time you are booking the tickets (via trip.com this was NOT possible), otherwise I can only urge to avoid.

### "Malindo Air is a disgrace"
Melbourne to Mumbai via Kuala Lumpur. Corona Virus is preventing me from travelling yet Malindo refuses to refund ticket purchased before the outbreak? I had trade shows to attend in India which have all been suspended due to Corona Virus. At the time of booking the Corona Virus was not an issue for these events. I have contacted Malindo and asked for a refund given:  there is no point going because everything has been postponed and  the Australian government cannot guarantee I will be allowed back into Australia without first going into quarantine for 14 days. Other airlines I was booked to travel with gave me a full refund without hesitation. Malindo Air is a disgrace because they wish to profit from the situation created by the Corona Virus.

### "payment policy was so inflexible"
Taipei to Brisbane via Kuala Lumpur. I wanted to purchase extra luggage allowances through the website weeks before departure and realized I could not. So I called the customer service and she told me that it was because I did not book my flight ticket on the Malindo Air website and if I needed to buy more I would have to do it via calls. However, I booked the ticket on the Malindo website. I could simply operate that extra allowance service online if the system did not occur such a mistake. Plus it takes 10 mins to wait in a queue to talk to the CS every time and the phone line is so unstable! Such a waste of time and money. However, before departure, I called in to buy the allowances and the customer service lady told me I could only clear the payment at the Taipei office or at the airport. So I asked the lady the opening hours at the office in Taipei and proceeded to pay for it. When I arrived at the office, the office was closed and obviously routinely away during weekends. Then I called again to ask whether I could simply clear the payment at the counter when check-in despite the paying-4-hours-before-departure policy. I was in Taipei when I made the call about six hours away before departure and I got my transportation to the airport all booked already. The airport is in Taoyuan. Therefore it was a bit of inconvenience for me to present myself 4 hours before departure just to clear the payment. I told the CS lady that I did want to purchase extra allowance in advance and made my actions to pay for it and all those showed that it was not a sudden decision. Anyhow, the CS lady insisted still I had to pay off the fees four hours before departure even after consulting with her manager. She sort of accused me that if I operated it online 48 hours before departure I could have paid it online despite that I tried to tell her it was not working even before 48 hours. This whole thing was really inefficient and highly unfriendly to customers. If you can make a remark about how many KGs I intend to buy, why can not Malindo simply make a remark allowing me to pay off the bill while checking in? Make passengers/customers to go to the airport  4 hours in advance just to clear the bill is pure nonsense. As my first experience with Malindo Air, it turned out to be the worst and the service was blunt. Firstly, the online ticketing system was poorly designed and considered my transaction done with an OTA. Secondly, the CS lady provided me false information and made me go to the local office that was always closed during weekends. Thirdly, the payment policy was so inflexible and unfriendly. Even worse, when I finished the flight with Malindo I found out my luggage was heavily damaged. And the goods in another check-in were also terribly hit. I've flown regularly but my luggage has never been treated that way with such strong force.

### "lost my baggage"
Perth to Trivandrum via Kuala Lumpur. Worst flight and baggage dealing. I lost my baggage while I was flying from Perth on 31 Jan 2020. No Response from Malindo Air. I register a complaint at Trivandrum Airport. But no Response. I didn't get my baggage today.

### "charge you even for water"
Dhaka to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur. Worst service you can imagine. They charge you even for water. Even for a 6 hours long flight. So, if you don't have cash and you are travelling via economy class of Malindo air they will not give you water free.

### "Overall worst experience"
Denpasar to Melbourne, night flight. Don't expect to get any sleep Expect to pay equivalent of $3 Australian dollars for a 350ml bottle of water. Don't expect any service or assist I asked cabin staff to assist with retrieving my luggage from overhead compartment and was told to ask a male passenger to assist me. When I asked why, she informed me that the flight was 5.5 hours long. Overall worst experience from a budget airline.

### "will fly 11 hrs late"
Mumbai to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. Staff is rude, they are not allowing to bring our water for baby in the flight. In the Mumbai to Malaysia flight they did not offer any meal or water (if you want you have to buy at very high cost and very less quantity. I brought a cup of water 50ml at ₹300 INR). In the ticket had mentioned only 1.5 hrs halt at Malaysia, when we reached at Kuala Lumpur we informed that next connecting flight will fly 11 hrs late. I shocked, I asked staff to arrange any other option or give us complementary, I was asking them again and again this but they did not respond. Even Malindo staff are not helping me to tell how to reach to next connecting flight terminal. Flight is very dirty and congested. In paper (ticket) whole journey was 13 hrs, but got 23 hrs to reach to Perth with pathetic experience.

### "cheap staff manners"
Kuala Lumpur to Brisbane via Denpasar. I didnt had change money only i had 100 USD dollars with me to buy a water bottle, i was really thirsty by that time as i was on a 10 hours long transit. When i was asking for a water bottle using that 100 USD , one staff member told me "miss, i dont have change'. I admit the fact that i should have bring change money but i was only asking for water not food or beverage. After 4 or 5 hours i again asked for a cup of water and this this lady told me that it is 3/4 malaysian rupees even knowing that i dont have change and specially she was in the kitchen and pouring some water on a small cup was not that hard. Very inhuman and cheap staff manners. I was shocked after experiencing this and i decided not to travel anymore on this airline.

### " Worst customer service ever"
Jakarta to Hong Kong via Kuala Lumpur. Flight to Kuala Lumpur was 2.5 hours delayed, missed my connection to Hong Kong on December 29, 2019. They put me on the next flight which was the day after. They destroyed my luggage by leaving it soaking wet in the rain on the tarmac. I complained to their costumer service afterwards, after hundreds of emails still no explanation was given on why the flights were delayed or even acknowledgement that they have made a mistake on handling my luggage. Worst customer service ever.

### "disappointed with refund issues"
Kuching to Kuala Lumpur. I am disappointed with the management of refund issues. I booked twice the tickets due to first time screen shown that my booking was not successful and so I rebook though the price was slightly different. Later, email came with two bookings and was charged to my credit card. Immediately on the same day I reported duplicate of bookings. I was advised by the customer service that they can only refund the lower fare and so I checked in the higher rate 2 days early before my flight. To date the issue still under investigation! The counter found that I've two bookings on the system so they called up the office. The office told the staff to checked in the lower fare and cancelled my higher fare. Told me that the other ticket will be refund in 30 days time. To date they had been giving excuses that I've utilised the lower fare and so they can only refund the higher fare tax only. This is absurd! By right I am entitled to the refund. It is the incompetence of the counter staff fault that caused this problem. How can an investigation took so long?

### "experience was shocking"
Kuala Lumpur to Da Nang. My experience was shocking from start to finish .. booking our flights online and then not having the option to add luggage we was flying the next day so we decided to do it inside the airport. We queue for 1 hour to check in to then be told we have to pay £352 for two bags weighing 22kg each for each kg was £8 for me - shocking behaviour. We then had to go queue to pay for baggage the lady wasn’t any help and just wanted us to pay. We had no choice but to pay. Tried to explain that there was no option online for baggage but the lady was rude and didn’t respond after we payed. £352 pound for a 2 hour flight for baggage is an absolute joke.

### "very uncomfortable flight"
Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi. I like Malindo's Boeing planes, but the turboprop was awful. Starting from the airport in Kuala Lumpur Subang, check-in and boarding process and the flight itself. Seats are super tiny in those planes. It was short, but very uncomfortable flight. I gave it a try, but don't want to do it again. I'd rather go to KLIA and fly on a normal plane.

### "One of the worst flights"
Delhi to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. One of the worst flights i have ever been to. Upgraded to a business class with an amount of Rs 27,000 for two people. The seats were not reclining, the tv screen was not working. And to top it all no food was served even in business class. We were rather uncomfortable even after upgrading it to business. While coming back from bali to delhi, we took the economy seats only, n to my surprise i found out even the water is chargeable, forget the food. And seats were dirty, one of the two seats which we took, the screen was not working again. The economy class recliner was also not working. Worst experience. Would never recommend anyone to fly from malindo air.

### "decided to request for full refund"
I got a call from Malindo Air customer service, was informed the scheduled flight dated 5 Dec is cancelled. So I decided to request for full refund On Dec 1, 2019 I made a refund request via Malindo Air site. The notes on refunds clearly stated refunds will be completed within 30 days. Today, Dec 30, I called the customer service and was passed  to the refund department. I spent more than 10 minutes waiting and waiting. I decided to hang up and call again. I called for the second time and the same person answered. I asked her how long it normally takes to get a respond for checking the refund status. She kept telling me she had to pass the call to the refund department. I asked her on their 30 days refund policy, but she twisted it saying refund will be completed within 30 working days. However, she promised me to arrange a personal call on updates of the refund. We'll see.

### "a waste of time and money"
I paid a higher fare from Ho Chi Minh City to Bengaluru via Kuala Lumpur. OD 562 was delayed during departure and was further delayed e route due to traffic congestion over KL. Missed my connecting Malindo flight OD 241 to Bengaluru. The company asked me to stay at a hotel in the terminal for two days cause the next departure to Bengaluru was after two days. Ended up buying a full fare ticket to Bengaluru without any refund from Malindo. All in all what a waste of time and money.

### "Zero customer service"
Kuala Lumpur to Hi Chi Minh City via Selangor. Has to be the worst airline ever. Zero customer service, expensive rates, one person at the check-in counter for the entire airline's baggage drop lane. Policy and privileges changed without informing customers. Don't bother flying with Malindo. You see all the negative comments and you should know why

### "did not apologise for the inconvenience"
Not Verified |  The flight was ok. Ran on time and was reasonably comfortable (we had purchased extra leg room). On the flight to Bali they did not give us the meals we had ordered and paid for with our tickets and argued until I pointed my name on the list that was not ticked, but this took persistent nagging of staff who did not care at all. They did not apologise for the inconvenience just eye rolled. On the way home we had gone through customs with empty water bottles and then filled them up at the airport water station. Then by the boarding gate they were taking away water from everybody. We were pretty happy to tip our water out. On the plane we asked for a cup of water and were told we had to pay. I understand paying for any other snack or beverage but a cup of water after they’ve confiscated everyone’s water? That’s just disgusting. We got a good price for tickets but would think again before flying with them again.

### "hard to recommend this airline"
Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. This flight run 4 hours late, causing me to miss my connecting flight also with Malindo Air to Perth. ON inquiring with a representative of Malindo Air in Bangkok Airport, I was told there was nothing they could do, and I would have to wait to sort things out when I got to KL airport. They did give me a letter stating the plane had been delayed, I would have thought they could have made arrangements before I arrived in KL though. On arrival in KL I went straight to the transfer desk. As i discussed the issue with your representative a very dissatisfied mob formed behind me, while a very upset elderly lady experienced a massive misunderstanding with another Malindo representative. In time, things were sorted for me, and a hotel, food and a flight the next morning was organized which was great. However I didn't reach my hotel until over four hours later. Some staff were very good, however, it became obvious that processes and staff training were in need of being fine tuned. After only 4 hours at my hotel i was driven back to the airport very early. Jay at KL was very helpful, and although he assured me my luggage would be handled by them, when arriving in Perth later that day, there was no sign of it. I arranged to have it sent to my address, however, this didn't happen, Instead, it was flown to Albany airport where I had to drive an hour there and back to pick it up. While on the flight from KL to Perth I found the crew to be less than helpful. I had paid for a meal, including a drink of water for the second flight that I had missed because of the delayed flight. I showed them evidence of this, but they still argued about providing me with a meal. I also outlined the bigger picture. They were still very reluctant to provide me with the meal I had paid for. They tried to tell me that the document I was showing them was for the cost of the flight. It was an add on, which it clearly stated. They even told me i should not be arguing with them. All i was doing was asking to have a meal provided that was paid for. Under the circumstances, it would have been wise to make it complimentary anyway. (the food was horrible) Even though the airline did some good things and some of their staff performed well; late flights, (yes the second flight didn't run on time either), lost luggage, argumentative staff, and slow processes its makes it incredibly hard to recommend this airline.

### "One of the worst airlines"
Kathmandu to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. One of the worst airlines to fly with which has zero customer service. The passenger next to me who had a very limited English was asking for water and the lady denied to provide water. I offer her to pay by my card and she told me she doesn’t have authority to take the card. My friend and I made a formal complaint to the authority of Malindo in Perth with the hope that we will get some feedback but they didn’t feel any importance to reply us.

### "I will never use them again"
Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar. I had a suspicion that this airlibe was going to be terrible from the outset. No more so than the fact I couldn't even book a ticket online. Tried several cards and browsers and no luck. Couldn't get through to the call centre after waiting ages on a few occasions. In the end I was about to give up and book another airline, but the flight times happened to work well for me, with Malindo. In the end I had to go to a local booking office to get the ticket. In this day in age you should be able to book a flight ticket with an international credit card, which I gathered was the reason why my booking wouldnt work online. Probably not a good idea to book the flight using a 3rd party (expedia etc). Yes, you will get about the same fare and be able to book online. However it wont include luggage and you wont be able to go onto Malindo afterwards and add it, as they wont accept your foreign card. Then you are unlikely to also get through to do it over the phone. So you will be stuck with doing it at the airport. Which I gather from other reviews, will cost you a whole bundle of money. Perhaps this is their scam and why they dont take foreign cards. Thankfully I paid for 20kg of baggage in advance at the local airline office. Although this was almost the same as the flight price, but way cheaper than at airport. So, the flight itself was delayed out of KL. Got on the plane and the entertainment system was down for the whole flight. Then I found that you didnt even get any form of complimentary beverage. Not even water! Now, being a budget airline, I expected to pay for food and snacks and certain drinks. However. to not even come around on a 3 plus hour flight with a drink of water or tea etc, is inhumane. You can buy a soft drink/water, but guess what??? They only accept cash! So for someone who is transiting through KL airport, there was no cause to have any local currency and I didnt have any other currency on me apart from Sri Lankan rupees (where my origin was from), which they dont accept! The airline delays me, the entertainment doesn't work and they dont even give me some water? Even for those reasons alone, they should just offer something. Anyway, they didn't and so if they dont accept credit cards for drinks purchases and I had no cash, then I guess I was going thirsty for 3 hours. The extra catch to this whole thing. At KL, you cant even bring your own water on board, as it's not allowed into the gate area, due to liquid restrictions and they have the scanners etc at the gate. Even if you buy water in the airport, you cant take it past the gate. This is a whole separate issue I guess and with KL airport itself. However, it still makes the Malindo policy worse in terms of the availability of water (that should be free) and thier lack of payment options to get it. Wake up Malindo. Sort out all of these issues. I will never use them again and people should avoid if you dont want to have major hassles from the start to finish of the whole experience

### "they have many hidden costs"
Bali to Kuala Lumpur. This company is an absolute trap, they have many hidden costs and have zero flexibility or compassion for their customers. They may seem like the cheapest option however I have flown with them twice and both time with their costs they have turned out to be the most expensive option by far charging $24 per kilo if you want to check in additional baggage even online. I urge you to avoid this company at all costs, the worst company I have ever had the unfortunate experience of transacting with ever.

### "Worst experience ever"
I booked tickets for my family to travel from Melbourne to Delhi for which I paid extra money for food and baggage In the flight, they didn’t offer any food and on asking them, they refuse and said that you will get food only in connecting flight. We paid extra $51 for food there and get only half dish of pasta for that. Worst experience ever. I recommend to not travel with Malindo Air.

### "Don’t fly this airline"
Hong Kong to Jakarta via Kuala Lumpur. This is the worst experience I’ve had on an airline. They decided to switch me to a cheaper flight a week before departure at first stating “bad weather” with a good forecast, then suddenly “operational reasons”. They just wanted to squeeze money out of my. Nothing is paid, including baggage, pillows, blankets, food, water. You aren’t allowed to bring liquids on the plane and yet they don’t even provide water. The staff is unhappy, condescending, and rude. Their explanation for everything weird that the airline does, like spraying some aerosol mid-flight, is that it’s “always required”. Don’t fly this airline.

### "never fly with them again"
Kuala Lumpur to Mumbai on 1st December 2019, flight OD215. Once again Malindo disappointed me. Once again I flew with them and flight delayed. The only thing consistent with this terrible airline is that you will get delayted. Will never fly with them again.

### "most inconsistent airline"
Colombo to Sydney via Bali. The most inconsistent airline I have ever travelled with the the poorest comfort by far. food for purchase with correct money currency only and no credit facility for electronic payment! Every flight I took from Sydney to Bali to kL through to Colombo was tough to purchase was only able to purchase on location of currency for food beverage purchases you better be on. The flights were either delayed and cause a scramble for the connection flights. The staff are surprisingly ok because they are not overworked. The seats in economy are so uncomfortable. Malindo also misplaced my luggage on a 8hr layover in DPS, and I was left stranded until my luggage arrived for connecting flight 4 hrs later. I strongly advise anyone thinking of flying with Malindo to definitely take a more reputable airline carrier as you may not want this sort of experience like I had.

### "800$ extra for 2 bags"
Bali to Trivandrum via Kuala Lumpur. At the check in they ask us to pay 800$ extra for 2 bags. We lose a tickets, with no compensation, still looks like a trick, we don't know. But it was a last time we bought Malindo Air tickets for sure.

### "absolutely absurd airline"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Kuala Lumpur. The airline refused our multiple requests to have our baggage in the cabin for our connecting flight. Promised our bags would come out first and it didn't. The flight was delayed which caused us to miss our connection. Made us pay for new tickets for the connection, absolutely absurd airline. Never again flying with this joke of an airline

### "so we miss our transfer"
Colombo to Kathmandu via Kuala Lumpur. Our flight was 4 hours late, so we miss our transfer at Kuala Lumpur. The company never apologize, they lied to us, they said they inform Kuala Lumpur airport and promise the plane will wait but nobody never called.

### "hand carry baggage broken badly"
Kuala Lumpur to Delhi. I'm disappointed to say this. One of my hand carry baggage was broken badly due to negligence of the workers. I brought up this issue once i back from Delhi, but they refused as there is no report. I noted this to one of staff at Delhi airport but they asked us to inform this issue at KLIA. And now they asking for tags and report at KLIA1.

### "choose a different airline"
Mumbai to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. This is by far the worst airlines I’ve witnessed. The worst. I reconnect every one travelling on this airline to reconsider their travel and maybe choose a different airline. Malindo has no regard for their customers time and money. Their hidden costs are double the air ticket. You’ll have to pay a lot to finally get your boarding pass. The flight is uncomfortable and the only thing they want is money by fooling others.

### "My flight cancelled"
My flight from Yangon to KL on 20 Sep was cancelled and I was informed that the next flight is 24 hours later. I was given the option to purchase the next flight out and to submit the claim to Malindo later. I then have taken another flight back to KL. Upon return I submitted a request for refund, and had to wait for 30 days for the refund. I came to realise later that the amount credited did not include the additional flight I had to buy to replace the cancelled flight. Malindo informed me later that this will not be refunded. This clarification differed from the assurance given by the Malindo staff in Yangon Airport when my flight was cancelled. The staff said that they will refund our flight ticket which include any ticket bought on another flight to replace the cancelled one. I am certain that I am not the only passenger who heard this. I am truly disappointed with this response as I was not properly corrected in all my previous correspondence with Malindo staff both at Yangon Airport and via email. I was being made aware that my additional flight cost will not be covered after I wrote to them again. Malindo staff definitely need more training with regards to company policy and consistent message to passengers for such instances. I have had poor experience with Malindo in the past for other routes like delayed or re-timed flights. But this is the first I had an unfortunate experience with them for cancelled flight, and will be my last.

### "Staff do the minimum to assist"
Bali to Sydney. Staff do the minimum to assist, guests are refused even water unless they pay. We flew with Malindo to Bali and return to Australia and they ran out of water on both legs, myself and partner purchased water for passengers who had no cash including a family with 2 little children. I get that it is a business, but refusing a cup of water unless they pay is disgraceful and cruel on a 6-hour flight.

### "website needs to be improved"
Not Verified |  Perth to Kuala Lumpur. Malindo's website needs to be improved. Unless travelling on business, even if you check in 48 hours before the flight you cannot make any changes to your bookings. There are no prompters or reminders to pre-purchase luggage or food'before check in, which is apparently what must be done. Their FAQs do not state anything about before 'check in' only 'before flight' which misleads a lot of customers. The customer service was absolutely horrendous. Whilst I was maintaining my tone of respect the agent was very aggressive and rude. I called the Australian 'customer care' line .. its called customer care when you are spoken rudely over the phone. The team leader though should be commended for her professionalism and her understanding and for her phone soft skills. They have a long way to go when covering international flights- the staff from the phone to the plane lack the knowledge of working in an international environment.

### "switch off their air-conditioning"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore with Malindo Air. They switch off their air-conditioning whenever the plane is on the ground, right at the second the wheel touches the ground. Really speechless, hard to breath. The air in the plane was torturous.

### "no pro-active update"
Johor Bahru to Subang. Flight re-timed with original schedule at 18:10 hours to 19:10 hours and now 21:00 hours - God knows if we are taking off at 21:00 or later. No staff can be seen at the gate to provide pro-active update. Other airlines are flying without delay. Malindo is far away from being close to a Low Cost airline service & standard.

### "Lack of organisation"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Bali. Booked the flight then read the reviews. Got to say they have managed to live up to the feedback on the reviews. Late, business no lounge access! Staff at check in were abrupt to the point of rudeness. May not have been Malindo air staff but they are representing Malindo. Not enough seats in the lounge, late check in, late flight. Lack of organisation.

### "never fly with Malindo again"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. I don’t think they understand the concept of take off time as I’ve flown Malindo three times in the last month and not once did it take off on time. An hour late, and its only a 1 hour flight. I will never fly with Malindo again.

### "the worst I have flown"
Sydney to Bali. This airline is the worst I have flown. On the way to Bali none of the screens were working due to a glitch we were told. When you are flying 6/7 hours this is extremely frustrating. Even the charger port didn’t work. It took at least an hour for the staff to offer snacks and when they did come down the aisle with the snack trolley I asked for noodles and lemonade and was told they were sold out! How can they be sold out when you’ve only been half way down the aisle! On the way home they took our water off us before we could board the plane. We were extremely dehydrated and had to ask the flight attendant 3 times for water. The third time she told us we had to buy bottles of water then was told it was cash only! We only had Balinese currency which they wouldn’t accept which is strange considering we were coming from Bali. And of course the screens weren’t working again on the way home. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "Terrible experience"
Kathmandu to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. Delay flights and cancellations with little to no information. I took two whole days to get form KTM do DPS. The first night they cancelled the flight and put everybody into a rusty bus and off a hotel close to KTM airport. When we got there we were informed that there weren’t rooms for everybody so I had to share a room with another passenger. And they didn’t have single beds, it was terrible. Next day the flight got delayed more than 3hrs so I missed my connection to DPS. This time they said that they will not provide accommodation as my flight was leaving early in the morning. Stayed at KUL from 19:50 till 08:30 the next day with only a meal voucher. Terrible experience will never fly them again. Avoid!

### "will never fly again"
They took our water off us at the gate so I kept my bottle thinking I could fill it on the plane... wrong. Forced everyone to buy tiny bottles of water but the real kicker was they were cash only. No one was told this of course and anyone who didn't happen to have cash was screwed and could eat or drink. So to stop the outrage they offered "free" water which turns out wasn't filtered. They damaged my luggage. Oh, and to add insult to injury they wake you up to try and sell you stuff that you can't buy if you wanted to because they don't take card! Horrible airline and will never fly again.

### "did not provide any answers when questioned"
Flew Singapore to Kuala Lumpur with Malindo Air. I flew both ways on the same day and the cabin on both occasions was at least 30 degrees! This is inhumane and they did not provide any answers when questioned. All they did was to ask us to be patient. Throughout the flight, everyone was fanning themselves but why didn’t they bother to maintain their plane?

### "delayed for few hours"
Ipoh to Johor Bahru. Flight departure time at 3.40pm from Ipoh was delayed for few hours - even by 6.00pm they unable to provide the reason for delay and expecting time for the flight. Almost 2 hours and they just provide a bottle of water for the passenger.

### "definitely never use again"
Sydney to Bali. Worst experience ever. I had a very unpleasant situation with Malindo Air. I bought tickets to Bali, however about a 6 weeks before my travel I found out that I may not be able to travel these dates so I contacted the customer service to find out if it’s possible to return those tickets and how much I could get back. They told me to fill the request form and wait for the answer. That’s what I did. I was waiting patiently and as I was not receiving any answer in the meantime I was doing my best to be able to travel on the planned days. Then just a week before my travel, when I was ready to go I received a refund which was $150 out of $600 I paid. No e-mail, no message, just a bank transfer. I contacted them again saying I’d like to get either my tickets or the money back as it is all some kind of misunderstanding. Malindo replied that my tickets were bought “under promotional offer” and they are unreturnable so all I can get back is tax thad I had paid. Well, the point is that my tickets weren’t “super saver” but “value”. I had bought them through official website plus I had purchased extra luggage so I don’t understand how come my tickets became promotional and nonrefundable. At some point, they just started ignoring my e-mails. How professional is that? I am not happy the way they dealt with this situation. I’m truly offended by the way the company treated me. All customers should matter, not only those who don’t have any complications. That’s the first time that a professional company made me feel offended. I’ll definitely never use Malindo Air again and none of the people I know will either.

### "diabolically bad"
Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne via Bali. I have flown with Malindo several times in the past and always thought of them as a good intermediate airline that represented value for the money. Not as cheap as Air Asia and not as expensive as Malaysia Airlines. Their food was OK, there was a free baggage allowance and the seating and legroom are slightly more generous than some. My recent experience, however, was diabolically bad. It started at the check-in where I was told that I would have to pay over AUD $300 if I wanted to take my suitcase because I had not booked it online. So I was forced to leave it behind at the train station in a locker. Then there was the meal which had suffered a huge quality drop off. The transit at Bali required 2 bus trips from the plane to the terminal and back not to mention a massive walk from one end of the complex to the other and back. Regrettably, they now go the bottom of my list and are the airline of last resort.

### "cheap and well serviced"
Not Verified | Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu. It was quite an enjoyable flight. Cabin crew and ground service were very friendly. After takeoff, there were served a welcome drink. The food was just normal. It was a cake or something. The seat was quite comfortable too as the aircraft is just 1 year old. I’ve been on Malindo Air two times, once was Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Overall, I still recommend this airline. It’s cheap and well serviced.

### "cheated by the expensive fare"
Kuala Lumpur to Perth. I am very unhappy with the unavailability of the inflight entertainment system on business class. Totally unacceptable to have it not working on both going and returning flights to/from Perth. I was traveling with wife and 2 kids and was relying on availability pf entertainment system to keep our trip enjoyable. I feel cheated by the expensive fare.

### "our baggage were missing"
Jakarta to Penang via Kuala Lumpur. A very bad experience flying with malindo, firstly during my connection flight we having delays more then 1 hours. It become worst when we arrived at Penang we found our baggage were missing. Until now from Malindo only email us that they cannot found our baggage.

### "an aircraft without IFE"
Kuala Lumpur to Perth. Boeing 737s are not, perhaps, everyone's choice for a flight of over five hours though this was comfortable enough, the leg room markedly superior to that offered in wide-bodied jets operated by gulf-based airlines. Fortunately I was pre-warned to allow a minimum of two hours for check-in, and I needed every minute. Malindo use a generic facility at KUL that can best be described as pedestrian. Worse still, immigration. The big let down, however, was the rostering of an aircraft from the Batik Air pool without IFE. Not the first time this has happened when flying with this airline. Remember to take a book.

### "never again Malindo Air"
Bangkok to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. Very bad customer service! Lady at the airport behind the customer helpdesk looked like she was mad at me for not understanding her bad English. Added luggage through their website, but the ticket number was wrong and they would not allow me to check in my bags under my name unless I pay 4 times the normal amount! I refused and had to take stuff out of my bag to get under 7.5 kg and leave it on the airport! Thank you but never again Malindo Air!

### "This is the worst airline"
Kuala Lumpur to Lahore. This is the worst airline I have ever encountered. They cancelled my flight without any notice and it's been more than 1 month, they still won't refund my money. Contacting customer care is useless because they never give a reply other than "your issue has been forwarded to the relevant departments" more than MYR 1000 and they have eaten all my money. I have no idea why such a fraudulent airline is still allowed to operate. I searched on Google for a feedback number since they are extremely efficient on email and I found more customers whose flights had been cancelled by Malindo and the airline has not reimbursed them and some flights had been cancelled 3 months ago and efficient* and concerned Malindo won't give the money back.

### "almost $800 for 28 kilos"
Bengaluru to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. Such an awful operation., they never tell you what kind of baggage allowance you have during online reservation, let alone the amount of money they want to charge you at the counter for each kg of "excess baggage" which turned out to be almost $800 for 28 kilos combined between 2 travelers, even though we had attempted to pay the much smaller amount at web check-in 12 hours earlier when their own website's technical issues would not let it go through. And then they tell you to speak with a reservations person when there is clearly no one available in person or over the phone at the time of the flight.

### "Malindo is the worst airline"
Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. Malindo is the worst airline I’ve ever had to deal with! Our flight was supposed to be at 12:25. Got there early, waited in a very long line for an hour only for them to tell us there’s no more seats because the checking attendant wasted another hour on her phone to check about my passport. They put us on another flight leaving at 15:25 that was supposed to leave from gate 2. We get there to board and they have no clue where are real gate is supposed to be. We figure out that now it has been changed to gate 6A when in fact the flight from there is leaving for another destination. Here we are 30 mins past our second flight time and still no idea what time our plane is going to start boarding!

### "warm hearted service"
Melaka to Langkawi. It was my first ride with Malindo, I was carrying my 4 years old youngest niece, at the same time I'm also taking care of my mum upon reaching the destination, one of the flight attendants who saw me taking care of both the youngest and the eldest at the same time, immediately he send me the baby stroller that I've already checked into the cabin (before luggage picking up), the little action helped to ease my burden at the point of time. My immediate response, Wow. The excellent and warm hearted service. Thumbs up to the flight attendant's Wow and warmth service, that wins the customer's heart.

### "2 months and still no refund"
Last minute Malindo Cancelled Flight from Lahore to Kuala Lumpur without giving any proper explanation. No local customer service phone number in Pakistan, so I called international phone number in Malaysia to reschedule but I was told that all Malindo flights from Lahore were cancelled for the whole month of July. I could not wait that long and due to last minute re-purchase ticket, I had to buy very expensive ticket for almost double price with another airline. I requested refund for the tickets with Malindo on June 30th, 2019 (had to do online, no phone request accepted). Since then I have been chasing via email and phone, till today (August 14, 2019) no refund issued despite several emails and phone calls. I again called today to Malaysia office and I was told it is still being processed and will take 2 more weeks. Initially I was told and it is also listed on website that refund processed within 30 days. It is going to be 2 months and still no refund. When I asked the amount, they told me only basic ticket price is being refund and not the additional payment I made for seats. What is rip off! I am very frustrated and the worse experience ever I had. I will never ever travel Malindo Airline again.

### "The service was fantastic"
I was a bit concerned about terrible reviews I had been reading, so didn't know what to expect. Had just flown the first leg to Bali yesterday and was surprisingly impressed! The service was fantastic from the minute we arrived at the airport. There was quite a long line at the check in counter, however 2 minutes later anyone with carry on only luggage were invited to an express counter and we were checked in about 5 minutes later! No flight delays. Aircraft was bit dated and there was no IFE on this aircraft which was disappointing. However if it hadn't have been complimentary I wouldn't have opted for it anyway so not a problem. Seats were a little uncomfortable but again not a problem. In flight service was fantastic by the cabin crew. Drinks ordered were delivered immediately and reasonably priced. A complimentary noodle or rice dish was supplied which came at a surprise as I was quite sure a meal wasn't included. For a budget option and based on this experience, Malindo Air will be my first preference when flying to Bali from Melbourne if they are offering a fantastic fare as we got on this occasion. My overall rating is 9/10, and haven't given 10 due to the lack of IFE. Not that it didn't have it, but only because the ticket was sold as having the IFE complimentary included although I'm sure there was also a fine print somewhere! Am now holidaying and I look forward to the return flight home next week and will write another review only if it is any different to this first experience.

### "Not flying again"
Kuala Lumpur to Kathmandu. Worst airline till date. Very rude air hostess and rude staff. Last flight in Malindo. Not flying again. No value of customer.

### "stolen out of my checked luggage"
Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur. Do not use Malindo Air. As a newer company, they obviously do not have high standards for their customer service. Money was stolen out of my checked luggage (long story) and I emailed the company. A lot. After being referred to baggage, I sent everything they requested (confirmation code, stolen baggage report) and received silence. For two weeks. I sent an email a week ago to request an update to no avail. The aircraft was equipped with televisions on back of the seat in front. The tvs in my row were broken.

### "200 USD for checkin baggage"
Singapore to Varanasi via Kuala Lumpur . I purchased baggage for my flight using their website as none was included in the ticket price. Only on reaching the website i was told that the baggage i purchased was only for half of the journey which was from SIN to Kuala Lumpur. Why they book baggage only till the layover? Asked me 200 USD for accepting my checkin baggage. Did not care if i miss my flight or my baggage. Rude staff, bad meals and old planes are some other highlights of this airlines.

### "never on time flying Malindo Air"
Johor Bahru to Kuala Lumpur. From 09:30pm delay to 10:10pm and further delay to 11:50pm. Just a short distance flight from JB to KL will take 2 hours plus in delaying! I am never on time flying with Malindo Air! Worst service airline.

### "Overall 48 hour delay"
Adelaide to Bali. 24 hour delay, emailed 30 minutes before check in. Next day same thing. Overall 48 hour delay - not advised that the plane was more than likely not going to take off and we should have made other travel arrangements. When we did finally get to check in, system was broken and we had to wait 45 minutes. Ground staff were working all hours and getting abused by customers because the airline they work for is incompetent - shocking. Wasted 2.5 days of a holiday!

### "flight delay of 1 hour"
Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar. This flight delay of 1 hour with no compensation. Snacks for 3 hour flight with water totally unacceptable, not all seat screen function. Unhelpful cabin crew on this flight. No email notification to some passenger who expected their ticket includes luggage. This cost passenger who already check in online paid luggage more then flight ticket price.

### "Food was delicious"
Not Verified |  Perth to Penang via Kuala Lumpur. Was totally dreading this flight. Boarding was great, in-flight service had lots of new movies. Heaps of leg room. Food was delicious and cold beers for $5. Waiting now for connecting flight to Penang.. Hope it's the same the way home.

### "baggage needs to be purchased"
Penang to Kuala Lumpur. When booking this flight I wasn't aware that baggage needs to be purchased separately. At the check-in counter I was told the baggage would cost me over 700 ringgit. Way more then the actual flight. I wasn't aware of this anywhere in the booking process.

### "Don't expect much from Malindo"
Uneventful flight from Perth to Kuala Lumpur. Paid an economy saver fare for this flight which was rather cheap. As luggage was not included in the fare I bought prepaid luggage. Because Malindo charges for luggage now there was a lot of people with cabin luggage to a point that there was no room in the overhead bins. Flight left and arrived on time. Staff was rather snappy and unhelpful and the complimentary food was awful. Was rather disappointed that IFE was not available in this flight especially due to the fact that Malindo promises IFE on every flight. Just got a plastic screen, As a result there's no USB charging port too. Just be aware when flying Malindo that IFE is not guaranteed. Malindo should just be honest with its brand. There's nothing premium about the service and experience. It is a budget airline with an identity and branding confusion. Are you Malindo Air or Batik Air or Batik Malaysia?? I would fly them again if the price is right on this route. Don't expect much from Malindo - just make sure they get to your destination safely and on time. Also, bring a blanket. They charge that now and the cabin is rather cold.

### "no information given to passenger"
Travelled from Kochi to Singapore on 15 June 2019 by Malindo Air which had a stopover at KL before SG for a 1 hr period. Reached SG, waited at the luggage belt for 1 hr and couldn’t find luggage. Went to report it, and got reply in a minute: luggage is still in KL and will only come by next flight. So the Malindo crew should be aware of this situation and they really dont care for their customers at all (no information given to passenger). Waited at the airport for another 3hr to pick up. Never again with Malindo Air. Surprises (30 kg onward while ticket showed 15kg return - repack your luggage even if you have no hand carry to make your check-in as close to 15kg or so.

### "delay issue is still there"
Johor Bahru to Kuala Lumpur. Not to choose this airline years ago due to its frequent terrible flight delay. Try my luck to take the flight this year but so disappointed to know that flight delay issue is still there after years. No improvement at all!

### "never use Malindo again"
Melbourne to Denpasar. My flight was delayed by 14.5 hours and Malindo chose not to inform it's customers until they arrived at the airport even though Malindo knew about the delay the night before. I had to cancel and rebook with a different airline which was expensive and stressful. I will never use Malindo again.

### "never fly this airline again"
Denpasar to Perth. I booked with this airline because of the time we would return home, depart 12.50 arrive 4.30. Our flight time was changed two days before our departure which meant our arrival time was 1.00 am the following day. Apart from this the food and service was appalling and I incurred a parking fee increase due to the change. I will never fly with this airline again and would not recommend it to anyone

### "appalling value for money"
Absolute appalling value for money, unhelpful staff. Have flown all over the world with many different airlines and this is hands down the worse experience my husband and I have ever had. Can’t check in online with a child under 12 which is annoying. Also couldn’t manage booking online because of this. We arrived 3 hours early for flight due to this, realised an innocent mistake in not having purchased baggage (despite having paid a lot for our fares). Were then told they refused to sell us bags as the online price but charged $25 USD per KG! I have since read this happens to so many people. Should be illegal. They will never see another $ out of us of any of our friends and family ever again.

### "not issued me with a ticket"
I downloaded their app on my phone and booked tickets. They have taken my money (5 days already) and they have not issued me with a ticket and keep telling me that its under investigation. No proper communication and no way of contacting the accounts department - the call center just put you on hold for 30 minutes leaving me on hold as they could not answer my questions. They have not given me what I have paid for and when I ask for support they refuse to communicate with me as to process timelines, risks or confirm that I even have a ticket. I feel like I have been scammed by this airline and there is no one to help - how can they hold onto your money for a week and not issue a ticket or even give a response as to the problem or concern.

### "never fly this airline again"
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. This is my 2nd flight with Malindo and I’m starting to think that I will never fly this airline again. I usually book my flight via Skyscanner due to work and last minute changes. My first experience booking with Malindo Air left me with no choice but to upgrade to business for 20kg of baggage. I’m not sure why but that specific ticket only has 15 kg baggage. The staff at KL airport advised that I pay for every kilogram and the price of that is very much higher than getting an upgrade. Today, I face a very strange issue of having no baggage on my departing flight and 30 kg allowance for my return flight. During my booking I assumed I will have the same 15 kg baggage as my previous flight thus I kept my packing light. Sadly I assumed that every budget airline has the same regulation for baggage but apparently it’s not the case.

### "cannot recommend it"
Bali to Kuala Lumpur. The worst customer service and worst Airline I have seen. I had a flight from Bali to Kuala Lumpur and when I received my luggage my shoes were missing from my luggage. I immediately went to the customer service but they were really careless and only told me I need fill in a report and write an email. After several emails and 4 weeks passing they finally replied and told me nothing was missing and will not do anything about it. This is really a joke and the worst customer service ever. I will never fly again and cannot recommend it to anyone. Its not worth it!

### "crazy amounts to check baggage"
Phuket to Kuala Lumpur. Worst airline I have ever bought a flight through all in all I call it extortion not being able to check baggage possible on line then asking crazy amounts of money to check baggage. I sorry to the lady at the desk not your fault but honestly what a joke need to get your systems right treat people fair.

### "received baggage with missing stuff"
Denpasar to Delhi via Kuala Lumpur. Outward journey was fine, but the return trip was a nightmare. At Bali, In the check-in process concern person didn’t give us through check-in from Bali to Delhi, they told us to collect baggage at Kuala Lumpur, We also had 2 bags of 7Kg with us as cabin luggage, The crew took our cabin luggage as there was no room in the overhead cabin and I was told to collect it at the door when I disembark. But when I asked for the bag on my way out, they said to collect it at the baggage reclaim which was past immigration in KL. we had a connecting flight in two hours. Flight was supposed to arrive from Bali to KL at 15.50 but was delayed by 30 minutes and arrived at 16.20, our next flight from KL to Delhi was at 18.00. At Kuala Lumpur International Airport there is Malindo customer care service staff was very rude, they were not ready to help us as by luck our KUL – DEL flight was also delayed by 30 min still they told us that as we don’t have enough time to collect baggage from belt, they assure us they will send our baggage safely from next via flight to Delhi only we have to do baggage lost report at Delhi. At Delhi, we did report and fill all the forms. we received all our baggage with missing stuff. It's a shame that such a distinguished airline company provides poor quality of customer service.

### "received minimal communication"
Yangon to Colombo. We were due to fly with them to Sri Lanka when sadly the bombings happened. We received an automated email offering a change of flight or refund so we opted to changed and then heard nothing. Due to Malindo Air not caring about the safety of their customers we were forced to fly to SriLanka. We tried called every number we could find hundred of times, we visited two different desks in airports, we send hundreds of emails and contacted them via social media and we received nothing. We were forced to take the flight and were met in Sri Lanka by the British embassy telling us we had to take the next flight out. At no point did Malindo Air care about our safety or offer any help. It’s been over a month, we’ve received minimal communication and no compensation. They not only ruined our holiday, cost us hundreds of pounds on calls and alternative flights but they put our lives at risk.

### "Worst airline ever"
Penang to Subang. Worst airline ever. I will never fly with Malindo Air again due to its bad customer service. Was having check in issue with the check in counter and the person in charge refer me to Malindo Air customer service at another counter and then customer service refer me back to the check in counter again. Could not even issue a proper document for me.

### "failed to provide a professional service"
I booked a Malindo flight from Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi for November 2019 from the Expedia website. During the booking process, the Expedia website states, to contact the airline for check baggage allowance and to purchase. After several emails over four weeks, Malindo finally emailed to advise my ticket does not allow check baggage, not that it does not include any check baggage. I emailed Expedia to complain and to cancel my ticket, when Malindo finally called me this morning at 05.30hrs to offer to sell me 30 kg check baggage for my flight at rm318! Therefore, adding what I paid for my check baggage to my flight ticket of rm90 approx, totaling rm400 approx, I could have got a MAS flight at less price! Both Expedia and Malindo have failed to provide a professional service and given the airline industry a really bad impression of false sales practice. I will never fly Malindo nor use Expedia again, ever.

### "Shamelessly ripping people off"
Kuala Lumpur to Phuket. I wish I wasn't in a hurry while buying the ticket and checked Skytrax for reviews. While buying the ticket I checked the class of the ticket, I couldn't locate the allowance for the said class. Expedia sells the ticket as economy, but what it really means in Malindo terms is super-saver. Reviews say it all. The airline lacks proper webpage to display ticket class and excess baggage fees. I wasn't offered to buy excess while buying the ticket, or checking in online as other low-cost airlines do. So I was under the impression that I had the economy class ticket. The person at the check-in counter asks personal questions they have no business with. 1kg excess baggage is 45 ringgit. I will never choose this airline again, and I advise all foreign travelers to do the same. It may look cheap, but in reality, it is more expensive to fly this low-cost airline due to their predatory misinformation techniques. If it is incompetence, I feel sorry for them, but I suspect it is malice after seeing all the other negative reviews here. It cost me 3 times more for a small 11kg bag than it cost for my ticket. Shamelessly ripping people off. Seats are optimized for extra rows, accordingly to smaller stature of average Indonesian or Malaysian.

### "cabin service is ok"
Johor Bahru to Kuala Lumpur. My flight experience a heavy turbulence due to raining along my way to Kuala Lumpur. Overall, cabin crew were very friendly and greeted warmly when we enter and leave the aircraft and very helpful guiding me to my seat. As the aircraft had very light load on that day, I can enjoy Row 28-30 myself. IFE System had nothing to enjoy and only have limited choice of TV programme and dated movies. I received a broken IFE System on my seats but luckily I still can use IFE System of my neighbouring seats. Ground Services is terrible in Johor Airport! Even I was required to get my boarding pass via counter check in, not self check in machine! 2-3 aircraft were leaving from Gate 1 and chaos in Gate 1. My flight was delayed nearly 1 hour. In a nutshell, ground service is terrible in Johor Airport and cabin service is ok.

### "I couldn't fault Malindo"
Denpasar to Adelaide, I've never been more pleasantly surprised. I checked in online, and was concerned because my name on their online account was my "LastNameMiddleNameFirstName Mr", not sure why, most likely as I booked through an online travel agent. Expecting to be turned away at the airport for my name not matching my passport, I got my first pleasant surprise. There was no line! 2.5 hours ahead of departure and no line! The staff were friendly and my check-in luggage was 1kg over what I'd purchased, but I wasn't charged extra. The plane was new, overhead there was plenty of room for carry on luggage. The seats were comfortable and had adequate room. The staff were polite and  left a meal for me when I fell asleep. The in-flight entertainment was solid for choices. The plane wasn't full so I could stretch out across the row. The toilets was clean. I couldn't fault Malindo. I will be recommending this airline.

### "a lot of we are sorry"
Bandung to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was scheduled at 14:10 to Kuala Lumpur where we had a connection to Brussels via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airlines. We got an email that the flight was delayed until 15:25. That was still ok since our next flight was at 19:45 local time. Displays at the gate confirmed. The take off time was eventually 16:15! We landed at 18:25. A Malindo staff guy was waiting at the arrival gate to explain that we could try to catch the flight and if we missed it, we could come back at their counter to find a solution and they will do everything to help us out. We ran to the gate and were stopped at security check: door closed since 2 minutes. We went back to their transfer desk and waited about 45 minutes before some staff lady appeared (we asked another company at the transfer desk to call her on the phone). She eventually sent us to their desk in the main terminal. In the meantime we called our own travel agency (business trip) which found a solution with Emirates to come back to Dusseldorf. At the Malindo desk we said we didn’t need help but wanted to get our baggage back. This story took another hour. This staff tells gives you a lot of we are sorry but very poor response. Their English was also quite limited and you need to repeat many times. Total we lost 10 hours and will have to claim. This is quite ok when you travel for business and have a extraction team behind you. But what if you’re a tourist with no credit card or agency to buy other tickets? When you check on their web site, you can ask for refund if the delay exceeds 3 hours.

### "a very miserable on board service"
I bought an economy return ticket from Malindo air which cost me AUD$786.73. I needed to change one flight but when tried to use the online manage booking, I found the change flight option was disabled. I called the call centre in Malaysia as Perth office never received the phone, talked with them after a number of tries and long waits and end up with the payment of a fare difference and change fee, a total of AUD$133 (fare difference AUD $92 and Change fee AUD$41). Although I was prepared to pay change fee, I did not expect to get charged additional $92 fare difference when I paid AUD $786 return ticket and the one way economy ticket in online was showing only AUD $267 at the time of changing. This airline has a very miserable on board service and would rob you if you need to change the flight.

### "never fly Malindo Air again"
Worst airline ever! I will never fly with Malindo Air again due to its punctuality and customer service. It’s horrible. Waste of time.

### "Its a trap guys"
I book this flight but i didn't add the baggage as with the super economy it is not included. My fault. At the check in they ask me 3 time the price on Internet. My booking was from Bali to Myanmar with one stop in Kuala Lumpur. I booked the fly as a single one, connected. They wanted me to pay two time the baggage as i was stopping in Malaysia!! So they wanted 300 dollar for a baggage when usually is 50? I paid 150 and i had to check out in Kuala Lumpur just to pick up my baggage and than go to the check in again, and pay 25 dollar for my baggage again! Funny that the price drop so much here in Malaysia. Its a trap guys.

### "ripping people off"
Not Verified |  Perth to Langkawi. Terrible airline, excess baggage fees are unclear, the rules change with each check in counter and are excessively high. I will never choose this airline again. I have only put a 1 as my rating because I can’t put a 0. It cost me more for a small 10kg bag than it cost for my ticket. Shamelessly ripping people off.

### "asked for water"
Kuala Lumpur to Bangalore. The flight crew was rude. Just before the take off I was really thirsty and asked for water as we made to wait for almost 20 min after the gate entry and had no access to drinking water, she said she would get it after the take off. 20 min after the take off I asked for it again she said she would get it and ultimately had to ask for it again and wait for 1 hour 10 min for a glass of water.

### "worst customer service"
Dhaka to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. It's a cheap flight with the worst customer service ever. Paid add ins for blanket and head phone, when I asked for it and produced the receipt, flight crews advised they have no confirmation of it and refused to provide the service and advised to contact customer service when I arrive in Perth. I contacted the ground crew and I was advised to fill in a form. So I did that online and got a reply about a week later, advising to attach the receipts, so I did and it's been 3 weeks did not get a reply. Contacted over the phone 4 times, emailed them 3 times no outcome no reply. Furthermore, flight departure time from Dhaka to Perth was changed twice and now I got a email saying my return flight from Perth to Dhaka has changed and now I have over 14 hours transit in Kuala Lumpur, I bought the ticket with 1.5 hours transit. Contacted on the phone, I was advised if I wanted a refund I had to fill in a form online, which takes 45 days to reply and once in get a reply to call back and cancel the flight.

### "Everyone was courteous and pleasant"
Took a flight from Langkawi to Subang, with my 2 kids (2 and 5). I must say, I felt welcomed and they treated me well considering I had to take care of 2 very hyper children. At the boarding area, the staff actually approached me and asked which destination I was heading to and the main reason why I picked Malindo is because of the service of letting family with children be boarded first. That helps alot. Parents, please take note. Everyone was courteous and pleasent. Thank you Malindo! Will definitely fly with Malindo again.

### "Boarding took forever"
Phuket to Kuala Lumpur. One of the worst airlines. Boarding took forever. We waiting in the bus for 30 minutes because we waiting for another passenger to fill the bus. The cabin crew look tired. No more again.

### "downgraded a lot since 2017"
Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar Bali. I flew with it before and never expected a lot of trouble this time. The seat I booked 8A was classed in the website as a window seat. But when I went into the aircraft (a B737-8) it had no window at all. There was a lot of noises from the kids on board but the air crew seemed to give no help on them. On the return flight same noises issue happened and no help. Inside the plane it was particularly hot though we put on aircon to maximum level pointing towards me. Meal is still complimentary however it has been downgraded a lot since 2017 and looks very simple now. They put out the snacks (bread bun, butter, peanuts and water) for the set. Water is free but you have to ask from another stewardess who gives out drink, if you want to choose any other types you have to pay extra. Staff attitude towards me was still okay which is only good thing. They let me have a second meal. I still keep Malindo as one of my choices cuz of its cheaper prices to MH (sometimes). When I only need are a plane to fetch me from A to B, checked bags with no add-on fares, some food on board so I'm not too bored and hungry, and bit of leg room on my seat in a short haul. Never fly on this airline if you expect high standards and want many comforts in your flight. Travelling for leisure, vacations etc. You will be very disappointed.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Denpasar with Malindo Air. Avoid this airline at all costs. Delays are inevitable, but poor communication, staff that don't smile, ground staff that lie to you, bags that go missing, inedible food, uncomfortable seats are all a choice.

### Malindo Air customer review
Delhi to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. The behaviour of staff was not good. They refused to serve refreshments complimentary. For head phones you have to pay or travel without entertainment and refreshments. Overall not recommended to travel by Malindo Air. Better opt for AirAsia for economical flight..

### "AirAsia is better"
Kolkata to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was on Time, Food tasty but less quantity. Spacious leg space.In Flight Entertainment good but Headphone not provided. The behavior of Cabin crew lead was very bad. For me AirAsia is better than this flight.

### "they cannot help at all"
Jakarta to Yangon via Kuala Lumpur. I was flying to Yangon transit in Kuala Lumpur for my best friend wedding and they leave my luggage in  Kuala Lumpur, and the staff don't want to help. What kind of airline who does that! They even said that they cannot help at all.

### "Horrible is the word!"
Malindo first of all cancel flights without informing any of us! We arrive at the airport and we are told sorry your flight is not 8:30 as scheduled but at 02:30 in the evening. This was a flight from KL to Phuket on 15th January. Trying to find out why there was no communication, the customer service crew are too ignorant and unwilling to help with an attitude. Anyway we got no choice but to wait for over 8 hours. We then ask the Malindo customer service crew to check for us if the other flights have been changed and they think we are a bother and replies yes no other changes. Next we go to the airport on 19th in Phuket ready for our flights to Bangkok via KL and the same thing happens, flight has been changed without prior communication. Unfortunately they change the Phuket to KL flight in a way that it won’t correspond to the KL Bangkok one, like seriously? We ask for Phuket staff to help us try and get another flight from KL to Bangkok the same day and they state that we have to go to KL and talk ourself and if they called the KL staffs don’t pick their phone calls. They tell us the only option is to wait in KL overnight and we might probably be given accommodation if we ask KL staff (not certain). We were heading to Bangkok for a very i’m occasion so we inform them that we will have to get another flight to Bangkok even if it meant another airline. We ask them if they would refund us, they state that we can’t refund and if we want more information we contact the agency we booked with. Unfortunately the agency no longer exists and we had no prior knowledge regarding this. We booked innocently in September for this trip but for some reasons we don’t understand why the agency stopped existing. So we are told no refund. Is this fair? Really? Anyway we manage to book AirAsia and arrive in Bangkok well. Note that that AirAsia flight was very comfortable and very friendly crew. To cut the story short, Malindo  are not professional cancelling flights as you wish. Horrible is the word!

### "would never use them again"
Jakarta to Kathmandu via Kuala Lumpur. Repeated flight cancellations and delays without explanation. What should have have been a 9 hour trip became a 21 hour ordeal. That's still not over. The plane itself was newer, seats were comfortable and clean. Just spoiled by the fact that I missed all my connecting flights and sat around the airport waiting for the next delayed flight. And a customer service desk that made a small effort but offered no apologies or explanations. I would never use them again.

### "not possible to cancel"
Brisbane to Bali. Booked flight months in advance, after 4 months from the reservation the flight company advises that the return flight can't be respected, proposing a couple of other flights to come back on different days that obviously don't suit my need. Proposing also maybe an accommodation if I'm forced to stay overnight, this thing is still unsure and I don't know when I can come back. They can book the accommodation only 1 week before the travel, in the meantime it's not possible to cancel the flight with this ridiculous company and book the flight with another one or I just lose my money.

### "Horrible, horrible experience"
Delhi to Kuala Lumpur via Bali. Malindo Air is the worst airline I have ever traveled, flight was delayed, staff were not co-operating. On top of that luggage was misplaced, staff did not know anything and were not helpfull at all. Horrible, horrible experience, one should never travel with this airline.

### "sort out their customer service"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. They have check-in baggage included in the cost of the ticket which is good. But the staff need to sort out their customer service. None of them seem to know what the security rules are and it makes for very stressful travelling.

### "totally contradicting services"
Kathmandu to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. I had a wonderful experience as the crew were friendly. They offered passengers blankets and ear phones. But today (January 13th, January 14th) as I returned from Singapore, I found totally contradicting services when I came from my transit ie. Kuala Lumpur to Kathmandu. - Neither they offered us earphones, nor any blankets. When I asked for a can of beer, the air hostess asked me to pay. And me and few of the passengers did pay for that. I did not find any smiling faces unlike what I experienced in my prior flight. As several of us were in queue for wash room, the crew member so rudely asked us to give her full extra space even though we were giving us enough space to pass.

### "$4XX one way ticket gone"
Perth to Kuala Lumpur. This is the first time ever that the Airline would weigh my laptop and handbag. I understand the rule of max. 2 handcarry luggages but never ever have any airline count my lap top and hand bag. On that night, I line up for an hour, then the check in counter told me, my hand carry luggage was over weight, OK fine. I moved my stuff to the check- in luggage. After that, the check-in counter staff said only 2 hand-carry are allowed with max 7kg. I need a hand bag to put my document and my laptop is already 3 kg. I told the counter, I am happy to pay for the excess kg even it is at a ridiculous price. She said "I don't have time for this, look at the line behind you! and she has this attitude problem throughout the process. I asked for her name, she refused to answer and called the manager out. I could not throw any hand-carry away as my little hand-carry luggage was already full. The manager said, you will need to throw one of this away for the flight. At the end, I said ok. I am not flying anymore, $4XX one way ticket gone. The woman staff needs training. Sent them a complaint and never reply.

### "really bad experience"
Kuala Lumpur to Perth. It is was really bad experience this time, as I flew last month and everything was fine, but yesterday I had been surprised by Malindo new policy with asking money for headphones, blanket, and Pepsi without any announcement. It is considered cheating as there is no warning message or email alerts to customers and no one was prepared for such situation.

### "budget airline in every sense"
Brisbane to Denpasar. Certainly not a glowing review from us in relation to this flight. So many things made my first Malindo experience a poor one, which I don't intend to repeat. Here goes: 1. Trying to check the status of our flight the night before, Malindo's website system said the flight didn't exist. I double checked and triple checked the details I was entering, making sure I did so as the webpage instructed. Fail. 2. Even after checking in online, the "bag drop" process at the airport was ridiculously inefficient, the queue took so long to get through and the time taken was as if we hadn't already checked in. I noted to the check-in lady the time, she noted that Malindo's check-in system is antiquated and takes far longer to use than every other airline's system. Fail. 3. No entertainment system on a flight over 6 hours. Old aircraft that just doesn't have it fitted. The airline obviously knows that particular aircraft doesn't have entertainment fitted, so an automated courtesy email to passengers would be considered good customer service, so that your customers don't turn up unprepared without a book or magazines or own device with pre-loaded media. Fail. 4. Throughout the flights, the toilets were disgusting. Toilet paper ran out. One of the toilets' soap dispenser was broken - the hostesses response was to wait for the other toilet to wash my hands. Really?! It's obviously been broken for ages, and the airline can't even put a temporary soap dispenser in that toilet? Fail. 5. Onboard catering. No menus, but obviously selling stuff because we saw a couple of people eating something. Once during the >6hr flight, a hostess walked by showing a bottle of water as if to offer it, but walked past so quickly we didn't even have time to stop her! Then I asked to buy something. The only payment method was Aussie cash. Won't take cash of the destination and won't take card payment. Seriously? Fail. Overall, everything about the experience proved this to be a budget airline in every sense. I'll make the effort to just fly Virgin Australia again in future (as I thankfully am for a flight back home).

### "the seat was comfortable!"
Kuala Lumpur to Penang. It was a 50 minutes flight, so no food was served on board. Surprisingly the seat was comfortable. Entertainment system was available on board, but headphone was not provided, so it's quite worthless because I couldn't watch the movies.

### "didn't get a single answer"
Kathmandu to Kuala Lumpur. I was in the flight OD183 5th December on my way back from Nepal to New Caledonia where I live. The flight from Kathmandu reached Kuala Lumpur with 1h 45 delay. To catch my connecting to Sydney leaving at 23:20 local time I had no choice than running. I was supposed to get my bag and recheck it as I was changing airline. But I had clearly no time and decided to get next flight instead, which I managed by chance. However I took a minute to go to baggage counter and they gave me a mail address and a phone number to contact later on. To this day I sent 10 mails and called every day and didn't get a single answer. Phone is always busy and nobody can help except telling you to call the number that never answers. One more thing, it is said on the website that check-in close 45 minutes before departures for international. This is wrong! It is one hour before, and this is how I missed a previous flight with the same company. I hate them now.

### "seats not all comfortable"
Perth to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur. Malindo minimizes expenditure in areas such as check-in desks. For check-in to take over an hour is, however, excessive the three staff struggling with what appeared to be several large family groups travelling with excess luggage, Other airports / airlines apply triage the queue to ensure those who can be quickly processed are prioritized, something that makes life so much easier. The aircraft for the leg from Perth to Kuala Lumpur, though only a year or so old, was for reasons not explained supplied by Batik Air - part of the Lion group - and configured for short-haul routes. Amongst other things, there was no IFE and the seats were not all comfortable for a flight of nearly six hours. The aircraft for the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Don Mueng was similarly in Batik Air colors but was provided with IFE etc. No issues with the connection, including bag transfer, with arrival in Bangkok a few minutes ahead of schedule - the bus used to transfer to the terminal not overly full and likely as not as quick if not quicker than walking from a distant airbridge to the baggage collection hall and immigration

### "I had the worst seating option"
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. I had the worst seating option ever. 8A doesn't have a window! I felt that the safety demonstrations were not performed professionally and the plane had all in-flight entertainments removed. Food was okay - cheese chicken pizza, but I wished they could have served better. Flight attendants did their job well. I wished that they have a seat map of their planes and improve their food service.

### "food was tasty and well presented"
I flew in on MH and arrived in Suvarnabhumi Airport but I booked a one way return on Malindo from DMK to KUL. Firstly, DMK is such a terrible airport that I can’t recommend it. It is filthy and worn out. Otherwise, the Malindo flight home was unremarkable. The service, boarding etc were all good. The food was tasty and well presented. However, the seats were creaking and showed their age. It was a 1hr 50min flight so that wasn’t a problem. Baggage arrived super fast which is a plus!

### "experience the worst service"
Perth to Kochi via Kuala Lumpur. Poor service, inadequate facilities, no actions customer service; even refused to give some hot water for a little baby to make feed. They are charging now like other major airlines and no longer economical, less luggage, and you can experience the worst service.

### "one of the best flights"
Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. From reading the reviews on I was expecting a horrible experience. But actually it was one of the best flights i’ve had in Asia. Checked the bags in at the KLIA express downtown Kuala lumpur and straight to the terminal where security and the priority immigration was a dream. The Sama Sama lounge was not especially notable for anything but offered a quick meal before our flight. In flight a welcome drink were provided along with staff taking meal and drink orders. Where we opted for just simple beer and red wine. The food was really good, nothing bad to say about it except it was a bit much. The flight attendant was always smiling and made it so much better for us. I would use this airline again 8/10

### "unresponsive customer care"
Singapore to Kota Kinabalu via KUL. Flight got rescheduled to following day. We booked a straight flight to Kota Kinabalu for 3 November 2018. However, to our dismay, the flight was cancelled and our flight got rescheduled to 4 November 2018, just 2 weeks prior to departure. We tried calling the agent and airline several times and our flight was rescheduled on 3 November 2018. The whole process of the rescheduling took all the remaining 2 weeks and the customer service took very long to reply to our email. We had to take the initiative to follow-up on the issue. This is unacceptable and they only confirmed our flight 3 days before our flight. The airline also refused to make any kind of refund. 2. One passenger ticket got void when we check-in When we checked in on the day of our flight, we were informed that one of our friend’s flight was voided due to system error. As a result of it, that friend of mine had to purchase another ticket to Kota Kinabalu. Malindo airline told us that it was the agent’s issue and when we called the agent, the agent told us that it was Malindo who cancelled our flight. Ultimately, we, the consumers are the ones who are suffering the consequences from all the errors. Denied assess to board on 2nd flight As it was a transit flight, we received 2 boarding pass upon check-in. At the check in counter, we were informed that the flight has been delayed to 1.15pm and we asked the customer service officer if we will be able to catch the transit flight as the time frame was only about an hour. The customer service officer told us that we should be able to catch the flight as the KUL - KK flight got delayed too. if we were to miss our transit flight, we will be able to board the next flight available to Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur Airport. We arrived at Kuala Lumpur Airport at about 2.30pm and we were 30 minutes away from our next flight. We rushed to the transfer gate and the gate to our next flight was not opened. We made it in time. However, to our utter disappointment, we were denied access to the flight as the staff told us that our flight has been rescheduled to a later flight timing (6.45pm). We were not informed on the change to a later flight We spoke to the duty manager and we were told that they rescheduled our flight to a later timing as the transfer of the luggage takes 40 minutes and our sin-kul was delayed. Hence, they shifted our flight to a later flight without informing us. We only found out when our boarding pass was rejected just before boarding the plane. The point being, we booked 6 tickets with free check-in luggage but we had only 2 check-in luggage. When we first checked in in Singapore they should have given us a choice whether we want to check in our luggage as it may delay our transit flight. We asked if we will be able to make it for our transit flight and we were reassured that it was possible to catch the flight. Clearly, it was not. Furthermore, we were asked to wait another 2 hours before we were issued the new boarding pass for an even later 6.45pm flight. Our new seats were not even guaranteed 1 hour before this flight. Another 2 groups on the same flights as we were faced similar issues: unresponsive customer care service, last minute flight changes, uninformed changes to flight etc.

### "This is just unacceptable"
Kathmandu to Kuala Lumpur. We were refused the business lounge due to our ticket purchase being prior to 15 Aug. As told by the staff here at Kathmandu, Malindo had given a standing instruction to the airport staff in Kathmandu that the lounge would not be available for passengers with tickets purchased before 15th August. This was not informed in advance to us. During the booking Malindo's page clearly states that the use of premier lounge is allowed. When last spoken to one of the staffs over the phone regarding flight delay, they assured us that we will be able to use the lounge. Upon arrival at the airport 3 hours prior to our flight at the check in gate, the ground staff refused to allow us the use of lounge due to the date of our ticket purchase. I called up Malindo's customer service, the staff who spoke to me was first unaware that such rule had been issued, however, the ground staff at Kathmandu had an official request from Malindo on the matter. Upon requesting this matter to be solved I was put on hold and the staff who placed me on hold was very argumentative and also rude and had the audacity of hanging up before solving my issue. I had requested to know her name, but she refused to give it to me, arguing over the phone saying that the matter would be resolved. She insisted on speaking to the ground staff and instead of resolving the matter for us she took his name and hung up. This is the worst flight experience I've had, Malindo Air shame on you and your customer service. I did not pay the price of a Business class flight for my family to be treated thus. This is just unacceptable! To future travellers you might want to consider a better airline.

### "Thanking Malindo Air staff"
Chennai to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. Excellent staff. Thanking all the Malindo Air staff to get back my lost wallet while travelling from Chennai to Denpasar, Bali. Also ground staff in Denpasar was very cooperative and supportive when I informed them about the lost wallet.

### "Overall service appalling"
Bali to Melbourne. Airline cabin is dirty. Headsets TVs very poor quality. Food is poor quality. Most concerning was that items were stolen from our luggage. Overall service appalling. Single worst airline I have ever flown with

### "most incomprehensible delay"
The most incomprehensible delay of more than 2 hours at Changi Airport, under the guise of ‘bad weather’ with no further explanation, when Singapore’s own SilkAir is merrily landing and taking off on the runway. Either the airline has stinged on their airport ‘tax duties’ or Changi has a conspiracy going on with its own national carriers. Considering the seat price difference is not significant, this is completely unacceptable. Needless to say, I know which airline to go with here on out.

### "Cabin crew friendly"
Denpasar to Brisbane. Plane clean. Seating adequate. Food and entertainment good. Cabin crew friendly overall. For a low cost fare I received all inclusions at no extra cost.

### "the legroom is spacious"
Kathmandu to Kuala Lumpur in August 2018. Although their air ticket is more affordable, the customer service of their crew where exceptional. They smile and they look you in the eye when they greet and talk to you. And, they point and show your seat with an extended arm and open palm. I loved the menu choices too, since it includes a vegetarian meal. IFE is very responsive and with good amount of entertainment, and the legroom is spacious for a 5.9 guy like me.

### "happy with no hidden fees"
Melbourne to Denpasar. I have flown with many carriers previously and this was the first time flying with Malindo Air. At first I was a bit skeptical having never been with them. I can honestly say that I was surprised, everything about Malindo I was happy with no hidden fees, great service, food was good, entertainment was included in the price unlike some, staff were friendly, both planes were relatively new and very clean. I would not hesitate flying with Malindo Air in the future.

### "The worst airline"
Kuala Lumpur to Colombo. Flight didn’t took off from Airport and we sent back to ground at 1.00am. We slept on ground and staff providing not any information at all. Seems to be they get away about the faulty flight but did a drama to avoid all cost. The worst airline in the world those who do not think about their passengers.

### "Worst experience ever"
Colombo to Hong Kong via Kuala Lumpur. Worst experience ever, got notice that flight was delayed to the next morning only after I arrived at the airport. Office staff were not so helpful, while Malindo Air only provides water and a meal box for passengers who have to wait for more than 8 hours more. I asked for a refund however the staff was not able to handle so many passengers requests on that time. I had to book another flight back home and have sent a refund request online and sent out more than 15 emails to ask about the refund progress, it took me three month to finally receive an email stating that the refund is issued to my credit card, unfortunately, the refund amount still hasn’t been put into my account since two months I received the email. I am not sure if Malindo Air is lying just saying it to make my refund a close file. Never fly with them again!

### "fantastic value for money"
I was a little apprehensive about flying with Malindo after reading bad reviews, but one must give credit when it is due. Note, this route only launched in June 2018. Check-in was very fast with no issues - an option to upgrade to Business Class was available for an extra $300 at check-in (we didn't take it up). The plane was quite new and we were greeted very warmly aboard by the stewardesses. Departure was on-time with no issues. Seat-back entertainment was available for all seats and worked well, not as good a selection as premium airlines but still lots to watch. USB charging was available for devices. Hot Asian meal was served quickly after take-off and was a decent portion. Alcoholic drinks were limited to beer and only if you asked (they're not on the cart). A hot pizza snack was also served shortly before arrival. Leather seats were not the most comfortable and not very thick however it was only a 5.5 hour flight so we didn't really mind. Blankets and pillows were provided free of charge. On arrival baggage was waiting for us. Our return leg was similarly comfortable - lots of free seats and chance to lie down. Overall a really good experience and fantastic value for money.

### "seat was comfortable"
Lahore to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was on time. The ground staffs at Lahore Airport was very helpful. The seat was comfortable but the food was under average.

### "price is not reasonable"
I used to be a flyer with Malindo Air for my monthly hometown trip from Kuala Lumpur to Penang. At very beginning, their services were quite well as they provided snacks, water and aircraft is comfortable. It has been more than 5 years I take Malindo Air, and they started to increase the price which is understandable & reasonable. However, I started to see how they save cost by reducing the benefit such removing the snack and only serve RO water. Today, they have totally removed snack and water; furthermore the price has increased dramatically. I doubt why Malindo Air claims themselves having similar status like Malaysia Airlines which is our previous 5-Star Airline so that they can charge so high. The air-conditioner was not working and the heat in the cabin is unbearable. Flight attendants were also badly affected. It was evident that they were sweating all over and that was not a very pleasant scene to look at. I think the price is not reasonable, they do not deserve this value of money.

### "Total waste of money!"
I have travelled a lot and would have to say Malindo Air is the worst airline I have ever been on. We were the only two in Business class and we had to ask for service and there was two hostesses. Food was a terrible. With the head sets for movies only one side worked and movies, well they would have had to be 10 years old on some of them. Seats were uncomfortable. Total waste of money!

### "Very disorganised airline"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Langkawi via Bali. Never again will I fly with Malindo Air, it was a first and last time. Had I known that we wouldn’t be permitted to leave the plane at Bali while they refueled. Most passengers left at Bali only about 20 remained, we were stuck on board for two hours! Cleaners came through, appalling clean and didn’t change the pillows or blanket in business or the rest of the plane. The blankets were refolded and the pillows plumped up. At Brisbane we were told we had to collect bags at KL - at KL they couldn’t find bags and we were told we don’t collect until Langkawi despite 4 different staff telling us to collect. Our flight to Kuala Lumpur was late therefore missed the connection where put up in a motel all fitted out like an aircraft even our room had aircraft windows and bulkhead last thing one felt like after 11 plus hours on a plane! Very disorganised airline

### "bad experience we had"
Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur via Bali. We were looking forward to a happy tour and decided to try a different airliner and book on Malindo Air. What a mistake. Don't look at prices when decided to fly. With the bad experience we had with Malindo Air we will steer away from this airline in future. We will never fly Malindo Air in our life again. Our flight returning home was canceled and were left on our own at the airport in Kuala Lumpur and had to arrange our own way to return to Australia. No support was provided and all dealings and enquiries were handled with an attitude of "We don't care". Airport personnel says we can book with any other airliner and claim a refund when returning to Australia. What a bull of crap. Back in Australia, the drama starts. We start with our claim and after many communications were advice that our claim for a refund was denied.

### "journey was nice and comfortable"
Chennai to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. I would like to thank the staff and cabin crew for a wonderful journey. The seats, sitting space, cleanliness, very attentive and responsive cabin staff. Meals, water and cold drinks served nicely. The facilities provided in flight was very good. The seat front screen provided entertainment and information that made travel easy, they also provided on ear headphones. We had a night journey and airlines provided blankets so overall the journey was nice and comfortable.

### "Just overall bad"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Denpasar. Absolutely disgusting. Delay of 7 hours. Old plane and just tacky interior. Seats uncomfortable. No WiFi, no entertainment. Food was inedible. Drinks sparse. Just overall bad. Would not recommend. Sadly I have to fly back to Brisbane still, horrid thought.

### "there are better options"
Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi. First time I ever flew Malindo and I must say the flight was only an hour long but there was a 90 minute delay time. The plane was parked at the departure gate but the crew wasn't there, I also noticed that the groundstaff were throwing suitcases in instead of using the belt. We were given a reason that crew came late from Bangkok. As for the snacks we were given a candy bar and a juice of our choice. Overall I believe that there are better options.

### "it was all rather nice"
We took the Malindo flight OD152 from PER to KUL in the business class cabin. There were no complications or unpleasant surprises at all. In fact, it was all rather nice. We got to hang out in the Quantas Lounge until take off which was right on schedule and our arrival at KUL was 20 min ahead of schedule. The cabin was spotless and the staff were very friendly and comforting. I have read some comments here about the lack of an inflight entertainment system (IES) in business class which was indeed missing during our flight as well. To those business class passengers commuting primarily in Australia and South East Asia, please be reminded that a regular economy class seat with zero IES is the standard in Europe in the business class cabins of renown carriers like Lufthansa, BA, KLM, Air France etc.. The only incentive for flying businesses class there is the slightly better treatment, a slightly nicer meal and the guarantee that no one will sit next to you! On our Malindo flight from Perth to Kuala Lumpur we had a nice big compfy recliner chair! Grab a good book or do some work on the computer and enjoy the flight! I was initially suspicious about Malindo Air since I had never traveled with them before - I would book them anytime again, no problemo!

### "got to be the worse airline"
Lombok to Perth via Bali . Has got to be the worse airline ever in terms of efficiency and delay. Terrible customer service. Staff does not speak English and will tell you what you want to hear just so you leave them alone. Missed connecting flights through the same company (Batik air, Malindo, Lion air) and they wouldn’t pay for any hotel to accomodate us for 14 hours. Missed the next day of work which of course is not going to be refunded. Not a single apology or explanation during this very stressful situation. Have been left drained by this experience and will not be flying with them again. Better off spending a little bit more on a different airline and get to your destination on time.

### "little bit of deception"
Perth to Kuala Lumpur. A little bit of deception is happening here. I have flown Malindo a couple of times and always found them excellent. Especially the value. However this last time on both legs (PER-KUL-PER) they used Batik Air planes which meant, despite paying for Business Class, there was absolutely no IFE available. So 6 hours each way twiddling my thumbs and looking for something to read. I asked the attendant why this was so and she advised Batik planes were now in service fore the Perth-KL run. So all the advertising for Malindo offering a full service from Perth is now false. Must say I felt more than a little ripped off. If I had have booked Batik I would have paid a bundle less. On the bright side, the food and service were very good. But that doesn't take away from the deception now being foisted on the public.

### "Reasonably good legroom"
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Reasonably priced business class fare. Check in was quick and smooth. Lounge access in Changi with a good selection of food. However the outbound flight was retimed and flight took off about an hour late. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. Reasonably good legroom. Return flight from Kuala Lumpur was more on time. Again very quick check în with a very helpful agent. The lounge in KLIA was however located way very far from the boarding area. On board service was good. The only criticism I have about the on board service is the meal only consisted of a small slice of chicken pizza and a small wafer snack. It was OK but I would have preferred to have a more substantial Malaysian dish like Nasi Lemak.

### "Where is your punctuality?"
Kuching to Kuala Lumpur. The actual time I buying the ticket from Kuching to KL is 21:15pm and received a sms notification on afternoon time that the flight delay to 21:50pm. Still acceptable the delay. I confirm with counter check in staff the delaying time is at 21:50pm. However, heard airport announcement that the flight delaying till 23:00pm once I boarding. Where is your punctuality? What the point sms notification on afternoon time? Do you the feeling of our passenger that I reach at airport at 1:00am on the morning. No Train, No Public Transport but only have airport taxi with double charge. Who pay this compensation? Do you think we no need work on next day. I reach home at 3am morning. This is not the first time I with Malindo Air - I have taken 10 flights with Malind oAir and they delay about 7 flight.

### "Never again Malindo"
Malacca to Penang. Poorly rated budget airline. Check in poorly organised - arrived 2 hours early, told had to wait an hour - no staff. Flight ok, cabin crew fine, aircraft clean, seating average. Be aware - excess baggage charges horrendous. Tried to sort out excess baggage days before the flight but website would not allow access to information. Told at airport on checking in - "had I been there 4 hours earlier charges would be half". Paid 720 RM for 22kg excess. Ticket for passenger this route 199RM including 15kg check in baggage. Complained - no understanding at all. Complaint in writing - not resolved, avoided issues. Never again Malindo.

### "Very poor amenities"
Denpasar to Bangalore via Kuala Lumpur. Very poor amenities and unprofessional staff. You won't be given water for at least 1.5 hours after take off, so carry your own water bottle. Food is pathetic. Blanket is not given until food is served. On asking for blanket for 5th time, the air hostess said "You want blanket first or you want food first?". There's no TV screen so carry your laptop for entertaining. Lights are almost always on and they won't give you eye-cap or pillow.

### "very average facilities"
Malacca to Penang. Basic airline with very average facilities. Major issue with excess baggage. Had xtra case which made us 18kg in excess. Charged 705.96 Ringitt. Suggested purchasing another seat with 15 kg allowance at cost of 199 Ringitt. They refused even though aircraft was half full. Was told had I been an airport 4 hours earlier charge would have been much less. Had tried to register on line for excess baggage 2 days prior to flight but website would not register my request. Have tried to contact Malindo but they refuse to respond. Great way for them to earn excess income. So beware with excess baggage. Amazed that they spend thousands trying to attract customers then treat them like this. Surely they would want to right a wrong to show good faith. Never again Malindo, how about responding to me rather than a veil of silence.

### "our first and last experience of Malindo"
What a horrible flight - late departure/arrival (over 1 hour), no seat-back entertainment, a broken WC leaving only one toilet for 100+ economy passengers. A seat that wouldn't recline, horribly bland food. Malindo is a budget airline that is pretending it isn't. But it is. This was our first and last experience of Malindo. In future we will stick with Malaysian Airlines, Air Asia and Firefly.

### "low budget airline with no frills"
We flew from Delhi to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. The service staff were good, the food was average, the toilets were average with a blocked basin and there was no entertainment. The seating was not too bad and the plane was not full. They got us home safely but you could see that this is a low budget airline with no frills.

### "departure always late"
Delhi to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. Departure always late by at least 1 hour. Keep changing the gate number for the departure. Turn off the entertaiment screen half an hour before landing and take away the headphones early. Only 2 washroom for 200 economy class people. Waited 15 minutes and then asked to sit without using washroom.

### "seem on the way to be low-cost"
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. This is my second time to fly with Malindo. Everything goes on like the first flight, on time departure and arrival, but nothing is really special. There was no IFE installed on the aircraft, not like the first one. I am not really sure how Malindo (Batik Malaysia) identify and define themselves. They started as hybrid airlines, and then claimed to be full service, and now they seem on the way to be low-cost.

### "flight is quite comfortable "
Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. This my first time to fly with Malindo Air, actually i am a little bit confuse about how to call this airline wether Batik Air Malaysia or Malindo Air, since the rebranding is never finished or not. The flight is quite comfortable since the first step of booking, check in, and boarding was smooth although IFE on my seat did not work. Flight departed and arrived on time.

### "been a horrible experience"
Perth to Denpasar. Malindo sold our group of five university students non refundable flights which were found out to be cancelled before purchase. Flights still showed to be departing on the morning of the flight on Malindo Air website  even though they were cancelled three days prior. Malindo refusing to give any form of compensation and now blocking all emails in regards to matter. I am disgusted with their service and this has been a horrible experience. I would give them 0 if possible.

### "Leg room ample"
This was, I believe, the first late night / early morning flight for Malindo Air to Kuala Lumpur on a Tuesday which may explain the small number of passengers. Checking tracking websites, the incoming flight was delayed an hour with similar consequential delay in departure. Arrival KUL only 15 minutes behind time. Ample space to stretch out on board. Leg room ample and seats more comfortable than those offered by other airlines. Basic food (form of pot noodles) and soft drinks supplied but mostly slept given the 0240 departure. Basic headphones distributed for IFE. Sign on door stated Wi-Fi fitted but not advertised on board. Beware KUL airport as departure boards are not updated, a change in terminal for the connecting flight to Bangkok not shown until 25 minutes prior to departure with resultant mad dash to reach the gate via the train. On time arrival at DMK bags arriving at the carousel on clearing immigration.

### "in my opinion it’s managed badly"
Denpasar to Colombo via Kula Lumpur. The first and the last time I will fly this airline and in my opinion it’s managed badly. From Colombo to Denpasar they gave us a 1 hour transit in KL and lost our bags, and the baggage services asked why I had booked a flight with 1 hour transit - I said if the airline couldn’t handle it they shouldn’t have let me book flights with one hour transit. The bags were later found but I had to go back to the airport to collect them after more than 6 hours of arrival. On the way back we had a 6 hour transit in KL and the flight was delayed for another 2 hours. After they boarded us to ththe gate the flight never showed up and they only told us that there was a technical fault in the pklane and a engineer is trying to sort out only after passenger made a fuss. We are still waiting for the aircraft.

### "Crews were attentive"
Flew Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. No doubt that Malindo Air is more than a budget airline comparing to other low cost airlines. However, many customer are not aware that the airline has revised its economy baggage allowance from 30kg to 25kg per domestic and international passenger since last year. During my flight, I was assigned at the middle emergency seat area. The leg room was huge. IFE content was decent but did not provide headset. Food was acceptable buts there was no choice,they do offer various of drinks. Crews were attentive.

### "four flights had almost the same food"
We used Malindo Air to fly from Colombo, Sri Lanka to Perth, Australia via Malaysia and returned back to Sri Lanka the same way. All four flights had almost the same food of rice (Nasi lemak). They had noodles too but when we asked the cabin crew were they said they didn't have the noodles option. While we were returning from Perth to Malaysia on 1st March 2018 it was supposed to be a 6 hours flight. I asked the cabin crew for a coffee, the cabin crew member told me that coffee serving time had finished. They had been serving coffee just 2 minutes before and they told me they would get me a coffee but I didn't get it. No dessert, no buns or coffee. They just serve the rice with a curry. Disappointed.

### "Crew polite and immaculately attired"
If only short haul travel in Europe could be like this! First time flying out of Don Muang, liked the airport actually. It was a lot more compact and easier to navigate than BKK. Check in was quick and Malindo allows you to check a bag in for free. The flight departed around 30 mins late which seems pretty much the norm for Malindo and an area where they should really try and improve. I was amazed at the condition of the cabin when I boarded - almost brand new plane, spotless, seats with great legroom and large IFE screen. Crew polite and immaculately attired. The IFE was more than enough for a flight of under two hours with several movies and TV programs. A hot pizza kind of snack was served along with a soft drink. All for a bargain price - was similar to Air Asia. Would definitely use again - in fact I've already booked further flights with them.

### "Almost 2.5 hrs delayed"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Almost 2.5 hrs delayed ex-KUL yet still put us at remote bay upon arrival into Singapore. Announcement given by the pilot are not specific and clear on timing. Mentioned 15 mins but delayed for an hour plus on ground. Totally disappointed with the arrangements for arrival. Inconsiderate towards pax who has connecting flights. Will not consider as my travel airline again!

### "delayed for 2 hours"
Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. My flight had been delayed for 2 hours. First time informed me via email, the second time was last minute. They didn't compensate unhappy customers. Malindo Air, please do something about it to retain satisfied customers.

### "Would book with them again"
Kuala Lumpur to Penang. I was worried about booking with Malindo considering the negative reviews, bu I had a good experience to Penang with them considering their low last-minute price and generous baggage allowance. Boarding started at departure time and we were about 30 minutes late arriving, but the crew was great, the seat was comfortable, and the cabin was spotless. They even had IFE but it was such a short flight I didn't use it. Would book with them again for holiday travel. Excellent value.

### "excellent value for the price"
Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar. Last-minute booking on Malindo to Denpasar. They were by far the lowest price that day, even less than AirAsia and with a generous baggage allowance. The crew was attentive and even served a free hot meal. IFE was not working properly and they tried to restart it several times but I was content with the route map. Seat was comfortable and the announcements were clear. We were 30 minutes late arriving into DPS but being on holiday I wasn't in a rush. Overall I think Malindo provided an excellent value for the price and I wouldn't hesitate to book them again.

### "They just do not care"
Bali to Kuala Lumpur. I flew Lion before on Indonesian Domestic flight said I would fly with airline again no communication at airport or on plane, no leg space on flight and I not that big. This last flight was Malindo Air from Bali to Kuala Lumpur, same airport service none and when give info not in English. I talked with other passengers and they. We're saying the same in Australia and in Bali, impossible to contact. I know only possible at Domestic airport if help needed, nothing by phone or email, or live chat. Our flight was late but was expected. The plane seating and entertainment was ok. The food was poor, no selection and other passengers we not eating all either. Return flight from Kuala Lumpur to Bali, ( note these are International flights). Same airport service none and seemed like Domestic flight service from a no where destinations and this in KUL a beautiful airport but seem were using backdoor service (none). The Batic Airline seemed like a old plane from looking out window to the wing. Looks like used puddle jumper for a domestic flight. The food on the plane was the exact same as Malindo Air going. I was at the front seating location on the plane. After the first 3 Row's the staff said only mixed vegy with rice, same as the flight going. I complained to the attendants, they said sorry Lion Air catering. Another meal not many people completed. Later I went the bathroom and both were not being used and the attendant was standing there and gave no comment. I went in and the seat was broken, cracked in half. Not even a comment from the attendant. They just do not care. This is very poor service for and international flight and bad for Indonesian tourism. If I knew that Malindo and Batik Air was part of Lion group I would have chosen other airlines.

### "would be exploring other airlines"
Flew back from Bali to Brisbane on 30th Jan 2018. Communication at Bali airport poor, flight delayed, no info provided to passengers. Flight home took longer than required. Aircraft had no entertainment etc for passengers, was a very poor aircraft. Flight to Bali completely different had entertainment (very basic though), was on time and communication was great. Leg room good. Do not plan on returning to Bali anyway but would be exploring other airlines if I did.

### "No aid was given, not even free water"
Flight from Yangon to Kuala Lumpur was scheduled to depart at 12.25 but received an email at 02.00 that flight would be delayed by 45 mins (acceptable). However only after check-in, clearing immigration and about 50 mins before departure was it announced that the flight would be further delayed, est to 14.30. In the end, flight only departed at 15.05pm. No aid was given, not even free water. Quite a pity considering I’m normally a happy Malindo flyer. If this happens again, I’d be very reluctant to use Malindo again. Food is okay, nothing great. Inflight entertainment is deactivated easily 20/30mins before landing (even if you are in Business Class).

### "Very bad service by Malindo Air"
Very bad service by Malindo Air. We were all traveling from Delhi to Kuala Lumpur to Bali. There was a 4 hour delay for the DEL-KUL line (OD 0206) because of which we were all put to another onward flight, KUL-DSP (OD 308) (Bali) which was 9 hours later than the original time of departure. (Shifted to 6pm from 9am). There was no compensation offered to us! They said their hotel was fully booked. Did not offer lounge access at KUL airport or showed even a little remorse about this. The managers at both Delhi Airport and KUL airport were particularly rude and nothing was done to at least assist the senior citizens. Would never advise you travel via this airline. I understand the delay, however, they should at least be apologetic, try to assist and offer some compensation.

### "have heard nothing"
Denpasar to Perth. Changed Terms and Conditions after I purchased the ticket. Wife and I were caught in Bali due to the volcanic ash. Had flown Air Asia return, but the return was cancelled. Malindo was taking bookings a few days later, so I booked a one way return home, however the flight was later cancelled due to further ash (no problem there). After 8 weeks of hearing nothing, I contacted Malindo and they advised I was entitled to a credit that expired in December, and sent me new terms and conditions that related to the ash issue. None of these were on the T+C's the ticket was purchased under, even though Denpasar airport had been closed due to ash prior to my purchasing the ticket. Asked if I could take up with the "refund team" and have heard nothing, except they are sorry if I've been inconvenienced. All I wanted was an indefinite credit as outlined in the T+C's I purchased the ticket under. Meanwhile, Air Asia gave a full refund of the unused portion of the original ticket (55% of the total ticket cost).

### "nobody gave us a reason for the delay"
We had a horrible experience on a Malindo Air flight to Kathmandu from Kuala Lumpur. Our flight was already scheduled as delayed 4 hours before the departure. We were asked to get into the gate lounge, waiting to be boarded on the flight. We waited more than 1 hr in the waiting room and nobody gave us a reason for the delay. The airport operators, just informed us that they tried to do their best not to cancel our flight and it was the only one off to Kathmandu that day. Any kind of information or refreshment were not offered to us. Almost all passengers were furious and the airport staff contacted a Malindo representative officer. We started to be boarded when the Malindo crew appeared, apparently, the aircraft was ready, but the airline didn't have any cabin crew. With more than 4 hours of delay, without being offered a glass of water or being allowed to get out of the waiting hall, the boarding started. A passenger asked for some water and suddenly, a cabin crew member started shouting out and quarreling with the passenger. The plane took off quickly, the only 2 sentences that came from the cockpit throughout the whole flight were "cabin crew be seated for takeoff" and "and cabin crew be seated for landing". Any information regarding safety, to fasten seat belts, weather, destination, delay, timezone, take off, the landing was provided by the captain. It was my worst experience ever.

### "experience was okay"
Singapore to New Delhi via Kuala Lumpur. Singapore to Kuala Lumpur experience was okay but the landing shook the whole plane. Kuala Lumpur to New Delhi delayed by 1.5 hours. Cabin staff were rude. One of them even shouted at one of the passengers. I had to wait for 30-40 minutes at the baggage belt for my bags to arrive.

### cheating by the airline"
We booked Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar, on that day just before few hours of the flight I got an email from saying that our flight is cancelled because Denpasar airport is temporarily closed as there was a issue volcanic ash. The airline just sent a email to us informing this and there was not call or even an SMS. We tried to call their customer care and no body was there to answer our call even after waiting for hours on an IVR call. Finally we had to stay at Kuala Lumpur for 4 days and come back to Kochi on 1st December using one part of return ticket from DPS-KUL_COK. During this time I was continuously trying to contact the customer care of Malindo air and no one was answering our call. I contacted the Kochi office of Malindo air asking for the procedure for refund for the tickets booked in the cancelled flight from KUL to DPS. But to my surprise they said that they can not refund as the flight is cancelled not because of their fault. This is completely ridiculous and against there all the norms and also there own terms and conditions. I had send few mail to their customer care asking for the refund bu there is no reply so far. I feel this is clear cheating by the airline.

### "you get what you pay for"
Flew Perth to Perth via Kuala Lumpur, Colombo and Delhi. It is a budget airline and it does it very well and you get what you pay for. Had 4 international flights in all between 21/10/17 and 9/11/2017, on time every time. To compare business class is like Qantas domestic business class, though Malindo International far cheaper than Qantas Domestic. I have not been to Antarctica but have flown to all other continents BC including 1st Class to UK return and have never been able to sleep on the plane until I flew with Malindo and unfortunately I was awoken on 3 of the 4 flights to be asked if I wanted something to eat - no I didn't, I was asleep because I was tired, please do not wake a sleeping passenger unless it is to adjust seat position for landing/takeoff. Have absolutely no problems with Malindo Air.

### "Service was pretty good"
Kuala Lumpur to Trivandrum. Flew Malindo for the first time, from KUL-TRV and then TRZ back to KUL. Check-in was seamless. Both flight legs were smooth and comfortable. Ample legroom in economy class. Service was pretty good as well. Food served was above average. Being a hybrid carrier, you get a pretty decent return for the price.

### "the staff is not empathetic"
Delhi to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. My flight was late and the staff is not empathetic. They do not care about the consumer and are only worried about passing on the work to someone else. Food is horrendous. Connecting flights a big no no, since original flights gets delayed all the time one tends to miss connecting flight as well. Then one had to pay additional to book another flight. Inflight entertainment is one of the worst I have seen on international planes. No new movies or TV shows.

### "one of the best in leg room"
I think there are mixed reviews on here because of the various routes, but the Brisbane - Denpasar route with Malindo Air is exceptional. For a low cost: 30kg for bags, free seat allocation (48 hours before departure), free video entertainment, one of the best in leg room, free pillow and blanket, free headphone, free drink, free meal (and you can ask for another if hungry). USB port for charging. Plus good times to fly, not too early, not too late. Nice staff.

### "very rude and frustrating"
Singapore to Mumbai via Kuala Lumpur. Absolutely horrible experience. At the Singapore check-in, they required us to show proof of payment by showing the credit card the tickets were bought with. Allegedly, this was required as stated on their website (although I afterwards did not find a mention of this on their website, Terms & Conditions, or on our e-tickets). However, my credit card number had changed a few months before. We tried to explain but they did not accept this. I called my bank and let them speak directly to the representative, but they would only accept "paper proof". In any case, we had to buy new tickets, which they said would get refunded. Overall, the staff was very rude and frustrating. Now, after months of emails and calls (with extremely delayed responses on their side), we still have not received a refund for the extra tickets. Customer care does not seem to know what they are doing. They say they are willing to refund the tickets, but we just never get the money. Our flight was delayed without any explanation or notice from Malindo Air in Singapore, and our bags were temporarily lost in transition at Kuala Lumpur. We did get them back after a few days and some confusing calls though.

### "did not inform flight was delayed"
Dhaka to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. We were supposed to leave at 11pm and ended up leaving at 2am. The ground staff who issued the boarding pass did not inform us flight was delayed. On top of that, the staff changed our connection to 4pm in place of the original connection at 7:45am, without even asking us! There was another 9am connection which they could not give as apparently they had to full book that due to other delayed flights.

### "warm, attentive crew "
Kuala Lumpur to Penang. A pleasant contrast to flying Malaysia Airlines. Near new Boeing 738 with sky interior and gate to gate PTV entertainment (own earphones). Spacious seats and warm, attentive crew in elegant kebaya uniform. Crew very good despite a packed plane on hari merdeka (independence day) long weekend. Wasn't sure about flying Malindo Air because it's owned by Lion Air of Indonesia (has bad reputation) but glad I did give them a go. I see they fly to Brisbane from one of their hubs (Denpasar). Would fly them more if they continued the Brisbane flight to Auckland.Or flew direct. Like Copa Airlines of Panama they are one of those little carriers that in my experience have carved themselves a niche and really try hard.

### "no in-flight entertainment"
Delhi to Hanoi via Kuala Lumpur. No blankets were provided on the flight to Kuala Lumpur. The flight was delayed and on 27th August took off only after another flight of Malindo (also from Delhi-KL) flight that was meant to take off much later than this flight. I shivered and there was no in-flight entertainment. Overall harrowing 5.30 hours on Malindo

### "experience is sheer horror"
Penang to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. On our way to Bali, Malindo delayed both it's flight so much, we had to stay over night in KL. They booked an airport hotel 30 km distance (!) for us, but only after 3.5 hours waiting and lots of discussing with them - our little son started to cry because he was so tired, but the staff served first the loudest screaming, pushy guys, the last who got served, were us (a family with a little child). We could not even stay 3 hours in this hotel and had to run back to the airport. They also screwed up our return flight so our experience is sheer horror with them.

### "your unhuman attitude"
Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. Got up at 6am to be at the airport in-time. Arrived well ahead of time at the gate. At boarding time there was no boarding call. My wife asked at the desk for info. The lady confirmed: 30 minutes delay plus cleaning airplane, boarding in 45 minutes. So we went around the corner to buy some food. After 15 minutes we suddenly hear a loudspeaker: Mr. Schemberger - last call. Quite surprised we immediately ran to the gate. The lady at the desk: sorry - gate closed. But you said 15 min ago: 45 min delay! The lady: sorry - gate closed. Staff will take 20 minutes to find your luggage and offload it. But if you simply open the door again (nozzle was still attached to the door), we will be out and up in 5 minutes - especially because you gave us false information about the delay / and no time to run back after the last call announcement. Can you re-book us to another flight. Sorry - no. Ticket now worthless. You give me 500€ and then you must bring your luggage through the entire airport, wait 4 hours till ticket office open and buy new ticket. Never got such a cheap, customer last mind-set. We hate your unhuman attitude.

### "service was nice and helpful"
Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar. Flight with Malindo Air was enjoyable as well as ticket service preceding my flight. 24 hours before my flight I had to reschedule my initial flight, as my previous flights from Europe got delayed. I was easily able to change my ticket for later flight with a small fee and they would process the payment very conveniently through the phone. The customer service was nice and helpful. My new flight got delayed by 1h and 15 mins, however they announced it in advance through e-mail. The flight entertainment was nice with few movies considering the length of the flight (3hours). The meal served was modest but still tasty.

### "the flight departed late"
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. This was my first time on Malindo Air this year, and I really hoped for a nice and comfortable flight. But, I was mistaken as the flight departed late, more than an hour after its scheduled departure. And the worst thing was there was no announcement made. I only got to know about the delay at the information screen. The flight was actually delayed twice. Nevertheless, the flight went well all the way to CGK with a few minor bumps along the way.

### "rescheduled my flight 3 times"
Myself personally will not take Malindo again. After they had rescheduled my flight 3 times on the same day and forced me to find alternative way to get another transport to go Kuala Lumpur for not missing my international flight. After discussions with them, they mentioned that I will get my full refund but no response since after I have given all my details.

### "business class seat broken "
Perth to Denpasar Bali. Plane was old, a lot of the business class seats were broken in some way. My seat belt was damaged to which I showed the air hostess who told me it was safe. You do not get access to the business lounges as promised. On the plane the entertainment consists of 8 really old movies like Sound of Music or Batman Returns. Drinks on the plane include veggie juice, water, pepsi (no diet drinks) or coffee (no milk) that is it.

### "refuse to lounge access "
Guangzhou to Kochi via Kuala Lumpur. Now I am on the way to Kochi. I came in the morning at KL and my connection at night. Still I am travelling in business class and it is more than 14 hrs but they did not provide hotel and refuse to lounge access also. They told it is only for 3 hrs before departure. I don't want to travel by this airline in future if they are not rectifying the issues.

### "service is extremely bad"
Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. Customer service is extremely bad, they don't pick up phone calls, reply email and enquiries. They leave their customer stranded. Worst experience ever. Lost 2 baggages and ground staff in destination took 4 days to recover the baggage and still refuse to send it to our hotel upon retrieval. Customer care is not responsive on the compensation request. All enquiries and communication is ignored.

### "ground staff let them down"
Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. I booked Malindo Air, but for whatever reason they decided to place my travel on Batik Air. My problem was not the flight, but as with most airlines the ground staff let them down. I had 10 hours to kill in Kuala Lumpur and decided to spend the time in another lounge im a member of at the airport to get some sleep. When i turned up i found i could not. The problem was as my flight had been changed by the airline i could only check in 3 hours before the flight, as opposed to an early check in with Malindo. That seems crazy. I asked if i could pay to change to an earlier flight, as they had 3 scheduled with Malindo - not possible they said, there is only a single flight on Batik and thats who youre flying! It grinds my gears the absolute lack of reasoning that happens with some airlines ground staff. You see the air crew working hard to mantain really good customer service, and it all gets undone by some of these incompetent fools on the desks

### "no inflight entertainment"
Perth to Kuala Lumpur. I chose Malindo Air over Malaysia Airlines due to better departure times from Perth (3pm instead of 2am). The ticket price of both airlines is comparable, and both are significantly more expensive than Air Asia. Found that the plane had no inflight entertainment, not even in Business Class, and for a 6 hour flight I think this is a joke. The only comment of the pilot was: "We apologise for the inconvenience", with no other explanation provided as for why they would send one of their short distance or domestic planes on a long haul trip. The cleanliness of the plane was terrible as well, e.g. the soap dispenser was not working in the lavatory. Never again.

### "Bad experience from the get go"
Flew from Perth to Denpasar. Got to the airport, no priority check in. The lady who checked me in was so rude and she then informed me there is no lounge access. I paid premium prices for business tickets only to be treated like a hassle and then told there is no lounge acess. This business class ticket was a waste of money for basically just the front seats of the plane. Will not be using again. Bad experience from the get go.

### "Thank you Malindo Air"
Subang Airport Kuala Lumpur to Penang, it was less than one hour flight to Penang. It was my first time fly with ATR aircraft. The flight was on time, cabin crew were nice. Me and my family were enjoy the flight. Thank you Malindo Air.

### "good meals and good service"
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. I got a special Business Class fare from Malindo Air and the price was even cheaper than Economy Class from other airlines. The flight was delayed for 1 hour without prior notice, I just knew it when I did check in at KLIA. Ground staff, Cabin Crew were good, good meals and good service. But no inflight entertainment as per in Malindo Air web and I couldn't recline my seat because the button was broken.

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
The worst airline I've ever flown. Perpetually late ex KLIA, no courtesy and next to zero customer service. No compensation for delays, late luggage, broken items nor check-in stuff up. Paid for Cool seats and preferred seating to keep the family together but their ground staff claims no record in the system. Had to insist they fix it, else my aged parents would be separated from us. Offloaded our luggage PER-KUL as plane was overweight (due to multiple oversized hand carry luggage from other passengers) but didn't bother to inform us - waited like fools at the baggage claim and the signature box on the Property Incident Report for missing luggage shows by signing, you agree the report does not involve any acknowledgement of liability. Website unstable, Australia customer service number goes unanswered. Only saving grace is PEN ground staff who agreed to change our flights to SZB (after much insistence by us) due to over 3hr delay of original departure to KLIA. Thankfully, PEN-SZB was on time, else we would never have made it to catch our connecting flight home from Kuala Lumpur to Perth. No  earphones provided inflight KUL-PER, cabin crew said "not our practice to give earphones for this flight". Overall ground staff not trained to handle irregularities, nor apologize to customers.

### "there was complete chaos"
Mumbai to Jakarta via Kuala Lumpur. The flight was delayed at Mumbai by 5 hrs. Could know the status only after reaching Mumbai airport. On landing at Kuala Lumpur, there was complete chaos. Only one person to handle. No separate service for business class passengers. I was stranded for 2 hrs just to get update on my flight to Jakarta. They issued brdg pass for a 8 hr delayed flight that too under economy class. Many passengers got next days flight only. All flights are delayed. I am still stranded at Kuala Lumpur airport writing this review

### "delayed 1.5 hours again"
Kuala Lumpur to Kuching. My flight has been delayed 1.5 hours again. It has happened so often ever since I started using Malindo Air. When I checked, flights from other companies were not delayed. Worst of all, they would only let you know that there is a delay when you're at the airport. So don't use Malindo Air if you have an important appointment to attend to or a connecting flight to catch,  expect a delay.

### Malindo Air customer review
I have flown with many airlines but this was, by far, my worst experience with any airline. While travelling from India to Kuala Lumpur, our plane did not had any screens for inflight entertainment. When asked, they said that it was because the plane is new, thus not equipped with TVs. Next, they gave blankets to only children below 5yrs. As we were feeling cold (it was a night flight and we were feeling cold and wanted to sleep) we asked for the blankets but were very rudely told that they dont have any. The food quality was also very poor. While returning back from Bali, we were told that there was no vegetarian meals although we had mentioned while purchasing tickets that we were vegetarian. We asked for water but were rudely told twice to wait. Malindo Air are the worst airline and would never travel with them again.

### "recommend using Malindo Air"
Great internal flight from Kuala Lumpur Subang to Penang. Really can't fault the airline at all. On time, professional and a clean aircraft. Cabin crew were friendly and you got a free drink on board as well. The price was excellent. Highly recommend using Malindo Air for flying internally in Malaysia.

### "business class not worth the price"
Perth to Kuala Lumpur. Malindo use the Qantas Business lounge in Perth which is comfortable and well equipped. Boarding was announced late at the lounge and the flight was delayed by 40 minutes due to late arrival of the aircraft from KL. Boarding was fast and once on board, we took off on time. Not a single apology about the delay from either the FA's or the pilot. Announcements from the flight deck were unclear but FA announcements were fine. The food was much better this time but no hot beverages were served because of turbulence. The seat belt sign was effectively switched on for over half the flight despite periods of calm weather. The seat was quite uncomfortable and the levers were really stiff and getting the seat into reclining position was difficult. Unfortunately, the IFE was the same on the way back making the journey really boring. I would probably travel in economy next time because the business class product is not worth the price. Having said that, I got good fares at a sale online.

### "basically glorified economy"
Kuala Lumpur to Perth on 18 May. Malindo use the Sama Sama Hotel lobby as their lounge. Boarding was efficient. The seats were wide but very uncomfortable with a flimsy and rock hard headrest. They don't recline much and have 4 separate levers to manoeuvre the seat into different positions. IFE is rudimentary but okay for a short flight. The meals are not anything special. They are basically glorified economy meals of slightly larger portion served on china. FA's were pleasant and efficient. They give out a Batik Air amenity kit which was basic. There are no bells and whistles about this business class and by other airlines standards, this would basically be premium economy. They advertise wifi but it wasn't working on the outbound journey. It used to be free for a period of time but now it costs quite a lot to use. Not worth the price.

### "experience with Malindo is horrible"
Never travel Malindo Air in Business Class: I traveled to and from Tiruchirapalli to Kuala Lumpur. Being a expat businessman, I travel by business class on many airlines. My experience with Malindo is horrible. On both ways from the available menu, I asked for chicken. They said 'finished'. The Aloo Paratha given was not to a good standard. Hence, I travelled hungry. The seats are with more legroom, but not comfortable. Excess booking of Economy class passengers were put into Business class. That has changed the Business class atmosphere. More leg room economy class would have been economical and better. I will never travel business class on Malindo again.

### "I forfeited my tickets"
Penang to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. Worst company ever! I am frequent flyer with multiple airlines and the way they handle passengers is ridiculous. The staff have no clue what is happening, from loading passengers, to baggage drop to offloading passengers that miss flights that they cause. I forfeited my tickets after experiencing their service. I will never fly with this airline.

### "worst experience with this airline"
I have had the worst experience with this airline, and it is still continuing over a week later. I arrived to the airport for my flight from Kathmandu to Kuala Lumpur on 30 April 2017 and was advised that the flight had been cancelled and was rescheduled for 8 hours later. Due to this I missed a connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur which I had to pay to change out of pocket. The airline was "not responsible" for compensating my missed flight and advised I could claim this through travel insurance. Surely it is known that a flight cancellation letter must be provided to customers in order for insurance to be claimed for this. This was not provided and despite many emails sent to the customer team I am still yet to be provided one and therefore unable to complete a claim. The customer team replies once every couple of days and sometimes not at all. Once finally arriving in Kuala Lumpur the entire flight comes to know that the airline has off loaded everyones luggage. Not only was this not advised during flight, the entire flight of customers waited at the baggage carousel in Kuala Lumpur for 20 minutes before anyone even advised that no luggage had actually been bought from Kathmandu at all. Despite it being a week later my luggage has still not been located. Even customer service from my local airport is trying to follow up (as I am not getting any reply emails regarding this) and are not getting a straight response at all. Despite calling internationally and staying on queue, (not getting through to anyone) and sending multiple emails, no straight answer has been obtained from anyone about either two of my simple requests. Not only has there been multiple disruptions to my journey, the customer service team are not assisting at all by helping to resolve the issues that they have created for me in the first place.

### "flight experience was great"
Flew from Chiang Mai to Kuala Lumpur via Bangkok. Booked this Malindo Air flight at the time because it was cheaper than AirAsia and for number of other reasons - 30KG free check-in luggage and free meal on board. For a budget airline, that was impressive. When booked the flight, it was a direct flight from Chiang Mai to Kuala Lumpur. However 2 weeks before the flight, I received an email notifying the flight we booked was no longer operating due to the airline route re-structuring. That was a bummer definitely and we were left with 2 options - full refund or re-route for transit at Don Muang airport in Bangkok. I chose the latter and only to find out the flight from Chiang Mai - Bangkok is with their sister airline Thai Lion Air. Therefore only fly with Malindo Air for the last leg (Bangkok - Kuala Lumpur). Safe to say calling them was a pain and the customer service staff at the call centre should be re-trained - rude and was not attentive at all. I did not receive my updated e-tickets as promised and that caused delay upon checking in at Chiang Mai airport. Luckily arrived at the airport 3hrs before departing. Everything else on board was great. Meals (lasagne and apple crumble pie) was OK although the apple crumble pie tasted like plastic. Got to give credit to the inflight entertainment and spacious legroom. All in all, the flight experience was great. However, the experience with the call centre and flight re-routing was not pleasant. If had not been re-routed, to say Malindo Air is a budget airline is so underrated.

### "I chose to be refunded"
I booked a flight with Malindo Air from Singapore to Miri via Kuala Lumpur supposed to be. But Malindo Air cancelled their flights after April 2017 from Kuala Lumpur to Miri and my flight is on July 21. Malindo Air gave me an option to have a re-route to Kuching which is like 12hrs drive away from Miri and an hour flight from Kuching to Miri. So I don't even know how Malindo Airways could think its a solution to the problem they brought their paying customer in. Another solution from them is to have my booking cancelled and everything will be refunded. Of course, I chose to be refunded and just had a different booking instead. So the cancellation request was done on April 6, 2017. Today is April 27. I checked my credit card online transaction to see if they already refunded my money, they still haven't. I emailed Malindo Air and they informed me that refund will be reflected within 12 weeks.

### "really horrible experience"
Denpasar to Mumbai via Kuala Lumpur. The worst experience ever. The food and service were not good, quality of food was below average. There was no inflight entertainment, how could you spend the time of 5 hours? I asked for blanket to crew and they said there was no blanket. I think it was due to cheap air ticket, but it is not fair to adjust it with cuts of such facilities. It was a really horrible experience.

### "worst budget airline I flew"
Flew from Brisbane to Bali return. It's the worst budget airline I flew. Bad food, Bad entertainment and poor time management. Very poor quality of food compared to other budget airlines. The Hollywood section only had 8 movies to select from on a 6 hour flight. Even jetstar does a better selection of movies. The flight was delayed both times during departure and it was disorganised and chaotic. The cleanliness of the airplane was questionable. The blankets were not wrapped on the return flight.

### "no solution was available"
Langkawi to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. I was flying with my wife and two kids. Arriving at the airport, the staff informed us that the flight had 1h 30 delays. I immediately told them that it will mean that we will miss our connection. After checking they told that we will take then a next day flight from Kuala Lumpur. As many options were available from alternative company to go to Singapore, I told them that it was not possible for our family to go to Singapore the next day as I will have missed a business flight that I had to take on the monday and the kids had some exam at school. After discussing 30 minutes, they came back telling us that the plane will wait for us in KL. Guess what, arriving at the plane was gone and they proposed us the original option which was to stay 20KM away from the airport in a small hotel and take the next day flight. I again complained and ask them to book us on flight from KL to singapore as 5 flights were still available. They told me to wait for their manager which I did, but this busy person only came after one hour to inform me that no solution was available. This waiting time has prevented me to take a flight on my own and then claim it via insurance. So if you have the opportunity to take this company and you have a transfer, run away.

### "will cost me way more than I saved"
Chiang Mai to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. I fly tomorrow, but already this has been the worst experience flying to date. Malindo Air changed my flight from the 18th to the 16th with a two day layover in KL. After spending an hour on the phone (which I paid for) they changed my flight to a one day layover and offered to book a hotel room for me near the airport. I never recieved the hotel confirmation. When I call back they say they have no record of me calling. (I have called over 7 times to date). When I ask to speak to a supervisor I am told he is in a meeting. One girl forgot to mute herself and I could hear her talking to the supervisor and him telling her today he was in a meeting. The other thing they do is promise to resolve the problem but they say they have to call you back - and then they never do. That has happened four times now. It's madness. Also since changing my flight the first and second time, they have continued to change it more times - 2 or 3 now. I can't keep track. I am supposed to be flying tomorrow but I keep constantly checking my email to see of it has changed. I had to cut my holiday short and come back to Chiang Mai a day early because the change to the 16th but now that I'm here they have moved it to the 18th. I cannot book a hotel room in advance for KL or Bali bacause I don't actually know what day I will be there. It's really horrible and to top it off they are so rude on the phone. Horrible. I do not recommend this airline. It was the cheapest flight, but now because I cannot pre book my rooms and also leaving my friends to travel back two days early has and will cost me way more than I saved. Not to mention all the sim cards to call them over and over.

### "if you can handle uncertainty"
So we took the flight on 1st April from Mumbai to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur return. On both days the flight was late by 3 hours. Cannot be a coincidence! On our way to Denpasar the staff at the airport was even unable to confirm if we can make it to the connecting flight since the layover was just 2.5 hours and the flight was late by 3 hours so your travel with this uncertainty. They just send send the passenger an email that the flight is late but they do not inform the airport. This happened both the times. Best part is that in Denpasar, inspite of the flight being late, it constantly shows on time on the information boards. The food is just basic and average but at least hot. On our way from Mumbai when the flight was last for 3 hours, and we finally take off, they took more than an hour to give water and food. No blankets. Night flight and they kept the lights on the whole night. Take this flight only if you can handle uncertainty.

### "never fly with Malindo again"
Very disappointed and will never fly with Malindo again. My luggage was severely broken and reported to Malindo office at Jakarta Airport on 5 March and was issued a Property Irregularity Report. Until today (28 March) there is no telephone call to discuss about the report. The customer service is hopeless, tried to call the KL office and Jakarta office but they are all dead. I spent all my prepaid phone card only to call their office and ended into the voice mail.

### "disappointment in business class"
Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur was a real disappointment in business class. During check in, even though 40kg was given to business class passengers they only allowed to check in 2 pieces per pax. if you have extra baggage then you have to hand carry. Once boarded, found out that the business class seat does not have any charging port and no inflight entertainment. Stewardess offered menu selection and when my companion have selected the food and I wanted the same food I was informed that only 1 is available and I have no choice to select others. And the most intriguing part is only 2 passengers on the business class section!

### "Great offer, patchy execution"
Kuala Lumpur to Kathmandu. Great offer, patchy execution. For the price they are the best I've seen. Full service essentially, with good IFE offering nice movies, TV, docos, games. But super late arrival, then sitting, waiting for ground crew who were slow. Boarding is slow, due perhaps to high proportion of inexperienced travellers. Flight good, cabin crew reasonable, food pleasant, but serving was disjointed with some rows forgotten for drinks, mains etc. Again, they've chosen an offer that is pleasantly surprising - very good. From that point, they can get the quality and staffing levels right if they choose. I've rebooked and will observe with interest!

### "I'm very impressed!"
I always thought Malindo Air was a budget airline and it was not until I boarded the aircraft that I realized it's a full service airline offering premium experience. In flight entertainment system for 1 hour flight; snacks and drinks offered as well; flight attendant nice and smiling - all in all I'm very impressed! Plus, their ticket was cheaper than some of the budget airlines even. I will definitely choose Malindo Air to fly to Malaysia in the future if the price is right.

### "surprised how good this airline was"
Hanoi to Jakarta via Kuala Lumpur. Very surprised how good this airline was; from check in at Hanoi (sure a bit of a delay due to long queue/not enough staff at check in), newer aircraft, very pleasant and polite cabin crew, well presented, good and tasty food, entertainment and smooth landing. Sadly, great experience was ruined by their ground staff at check in in Hanoi and transit boarding gate in Kuala Lumpur. Firstly, check in staff did not informed us that we will be seated separately between KUL-JKT, how strange. Secondly, when we found out upon arrival in KL, we tried to look for your staff, it wasn't easy, they are nowhere to be found. Upon finding this the staff brushed us off, "full flight" to add insult to injury, "why didn't you check at Hanoi? and walked off. Well, we are husband and wife travelling together on a single booking PNR, is it part of their duty of care/customer service as Low Cost Carrier to tell us that you are going to separate our seats? Or they don't teach you at Malindo Air or more importantly life, be kind, pleasant, helpful and do your job well, furthermore your job is to assist your client who directly provided you with your employment as your action reflects on the company you work for.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Kuala Lumpur to Johor Bahru. Smooth check in. Staff were great, attentive and eager to help. They smile and provide the highest level of service. The aircraft has personal inflight entertainment in each seat. There was spacious legroom even in the economy class, they do provide a complimentary 30kg baggage allowance and meals. Overall, nice airline and I will definitely fly with them again.

### "will never fly them again"
Kuala Lumpur to Perth. We boarded the plane for our flight to Perth. No greeting from cabin staff. After all passengers were boarded announcement from the pilots we were told there would be a 20 minute due to the lightening as they could not refuel during the storm, completely understandable. After the delay we taxied to the runway once the plane started down the runway it started to vibrate and had excessive noise in the plane. It was so bad my window shade would not stay up I was in seat 10A right by the left engine. After we lifted off the engine went bang and  then had the acrid smell of burning coming into the plane and I realised we were circling over the ocean maybe dumping fuel. The staff at this point went to the front of the plane to man the emergency doors. Shortly after this the pilots came on and advised we would be returning to KL for landing. On landing they thanked us for our understanding with the navigational problem. They offered a substitute flight to Perth or food vouchers if we chose to cancel our flight. We cancelled and were advised our bags would be ready for collection in and a half hours. Our flight was due to take off at 6.45pm close to midnight after waiting for our luggage we were told the plane was pushing back our luggage was on board. When I said I wanted my luggage, the Malindo person told me tough and what was I going to do about it. He then reassured me it would be held in Perth by Malindo for collection. The next morning I received a call from a Jetstar member to say they had my luggage as it had been left unattended at Perth terminal. I have sent an email to Malindo as yet they have ignored it. Things happen and I respect that, however it is the total disrespect and lack of compassion and communication by Malindo that is the reason why I have written this revue and will never fly them again.

### "do not recommend Malindo Air"
Ho Chi Minh City to Langkawi via Kuala Lumpur. I do not recommend Malindo Air to anyone. A few days before our flight (it was not direct flight, we had to stop in KL for a few hours) they sent me new tickets for totally different times and even days without any excuse or warnings. My program was crashed so I had to send them cancellation with request for full refund. Lucky me, the last moment I still could buy another flight from other company. I called a few times to Malindo and at last they accepted my refund request, call center said - no problem you will get it a 30 days. After more than 30 days i called them again to find out where is my refund but they even didn't begin a process of refund. Now im calling again and getting the answer I have to wait 45 days more after my call. This is cheating company! They should improve their services even they are budget air company.

### "would recommend this airline "
Kuala Lumpur to Mumbai with Malindo Air. Excellent service, affordable flight rate, on time, food and beverages excellent. Cabin staff very helpful. After boarding the flight right through to our destination the staff were friendly and courteous. I would reccommend this recommend to all.

### "last time by this airline"
We travelled by Malindo from Amritsar to Denpasar return via Kuala Lumpur. In the last leg Kuala Lumpur to Amritsar flight, we asked for vegetarian food for my wife. We had pre booked meals done so that we could be sure that she gets vegetarian food. My wife was served Chicken even after ordering vegetarian. The cabin crew was not even aware of what meant by 'Hindu Meal' (which was mentioned on the box) and told that it was vegetarian. When she took a bite, it was discovered that it was chicken. Upon asking the air hostess she said that it was my fault and 'none of her business' as to whether my wife was a vegetarian or not. This shows much disciplined their staff is. Upon asking other air hostess for the rude air hostess name, no one told her name, and they ganged up, claiming that they do not know each other's name. This was the first and the last time I travelled by this airline.

### "disappointed in this airline"
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. I'm disappointed in this airline. First of all when checking in they say the flight will be delayed from 9.30pm to 10.10pm. Okay I understand so it's okay. After change from gate A9 to A17 which is all the way to the end. No announcement or anything, everyone just waiting. Flight delayed by 40 minutes.

### "looking tired and overworked"
Colombo to Denpasar Bali via Kuala Lumpur. Our flights out of Colombo and out of Kuala Lumpur was good and the staff too were okay, although not too friendly. The problem was on the flight out of Bali on 12th of Feb 2017. The staff were not smiling with long faces looking tired and overworked. When they served they just shoved Vegetarian meals in front of us, my friends in seats 11 AB&C refused these meals and then they provided non vegetarian meals. We arrived in KL and had to wait 8 hours for a connection and we approached the Milindo counter and tried to inquire as to what help or whether we are provided with any king of refreshment. But we were totally ignored.

### "fly due to competitive pricing"
Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. When comes to comparison with local budget airlines I prefer to fly with Malindo Air due to competitive pricing and travel package. Although, Malindo Air still have a lot of room to be improve in term of their online and offline customer service. During my latest flight, I was quite impressed with their crew and food offered. An attentive and polite crew team. Yet, they served small piece of pizza, muffin and water in a small box. Before this, I only served with sandwiches or slice of cake with water only. Comfortable seat with plenty of leg room compared with its competitor. As a budget airline, they have been offered more than the value that we have to paid including luggage & meal (referring to their promo fair price). I would like to try on their business class in the near future.

### "lacklustre service"
Kuala Lumpur to Dhaka. Flight OD166 with Malindo Air. Frustration got the better of the cabin crew. Their overall condescending attitude towards customers was shocking. We asked for water 3 times before we were served. Overall lacklustre service topped with rude behavior. My return flight will be the last time I'll ever fly Malindo Air. They also advertise WiFi on board which was unavailable. Only available on certain flights. I felt deceived.

### "outstanding value for money"
Kuala Lumpur to Perth. My first experience with Malindo was very good and I will definitely repeat it. All staff very friendly except for the check-in agent in KUL who wasn't very friendly nor talkative although completed their job properly. She just gave me my boarding passes with no thank you, have a good flight, etc. That's ok for me, I can accept stank faces but no inefficiency. Conversely, the boarding staff at the gate and flight attendants in the flight were very attentive and friendly. The pilot informed us very well during the flight in a very understandable English. Finally, deplaning was smooth and luggage arrived very quickly. The food is not great but the drinks selections are OK with beer and wine included. The seat is surprisingly comfortable although it doesn't have neck support. But in terms of width and leg room is OK for an Economy class seat. I definitely will repeat it as my expectation (mostly LCC kind of service) was surpassed and I got an outstanding value for money.

### "one of the best crew I have seen"
I was flying Malindo Air back and forth from Kathmandu to Kuala Lumpur with my family. I prefer this Low Cost Airline unlike others as this one gives you 30 kgs of luggage and food to eat whereas on other airlines you would need to purchase these items. I was seated at the front so I was very happy with my seat and food was great. The inflight entertainment was excellent. One of the best crew I have seen. Would recommend this airline if you're flying from Nepal.

### "no information of our lost baggage"
Kathmandu to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. I was on the family trip to Singapore from 2nd to 9th January. At Singapore Airport we know that our one baggage was lost. The SATS Baggare services told us that within 24 hrs they will convey us the status of our baggage and give us receipt of the complained. However, they have not sent any information to us. We have contacted them through our hotel staff several times but they did not response warmly. On returning back on 9th Jan we show our receipt to Malindo staff on the Singapore counter but they told us complain it through website and instead of helping us they asked us to board. On the customer survey form on the board we again fill the survey form and enquired about the lost baggage. After reaching Kathmandu we contacted the Customer Service center of Malindo they told us to go to airport and enquired. However, the airport personnel told us that this is the responsibility of Malindo airline. I along my wife and daughter has to spent 6 night in Singapore without our baggage has to buy necessary stuff there that forced to postponed our pre scheduled trip and tour. Even now no information of our lost baggage and even the correct information about where to complain and how to proceed it.

### "staff were lovely"
Kuala Lumour to Langkawi with Malindo Air. The staff were lovely and the rules were explained clearly. It's not a long flight but I did get a delicious biscuit. The price is reasonable for a budget airline. The seat could be better with more recline and it's too narrow.

### "ground service is simply terrible"
I am a frequent business traveler throughout SE Asia and utilize many airlines. As a business owner, I am not a particularly price conscious flyer but service is important. I'm sadly disappointed with Malindo Air. I've flown the Ho Chi Minh-Kuala Lumpur route 5+ times in the past couple of months. The ground customer service is simply terrible, especially at SGN airport. I would encourage you to think twice and consider your alternatives before choosing this airline. The airline market is highly competitive in SE Asia and I would hope that airlines begin to differentiate themselves on service, not only price. Malaysia Airlines, Vietnam Airlines, and United appear to be much more focused on customer satisfaction. Tired of the hassle with Malindo - will move on to other carriers.

### "very few blankets are available inflight"
Flew Malindo Air from Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur. Check In - Flight was delayed by hour due to late arrival of incoming flight, this was informed at check-in counter. Boarding was smooth and completed in 15 minutes. Seat - Overall seat comfort is OK. Legroom is good. Food - They give two options, Veg or Non-Veg. Small Cracker biscuit pack (2 biscuits) provided first. Food quantity is very low. Food quality is very poor. Salt and paper not provided with food. For drinks you will get either Tea, Coffee or soft drinks. No Alcohol is served in economy class. Inflight Entertainment - IFE has latest movies but number of movies are very less(around 15-20) Few Important things: 1) Very few blankets are available inflight. 2) Seat 10A does not have a window.

### "my choice for intra Asia flights"
Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. First time using Malindo Air which is marketed as a low cost carrier, however they offer business class so I'm not sure where they place themselves. While they do use DMK instead of Suvarnabhumi they are far less expensive than the legacy carriers on this route, a route I cover fairly often. Check in completed quickly and politely, security and immigration was also very quick. No lounge available at DMK however there are food and wifi options. Priority boarding from gate 23 on to a newish looking B737-900 seat 1A very comfortable. The flight was only half full and no other passenger in business class. The service was as good if not better than most airlines I use. Clearly not to Qatar Airways standard but great all the same. Drinks served pre-departure and we departed on time . Once airborne breakfast choice offered which was well presented and tasted very good. The seat in 2-2 configuration was very comfortable allowing a good 1 hour sleep, arrived KUL on time and to KLIA 1 instead of the LCC terminal. Bags delivered without delay. Great service which some European airlines could learn a thing or 2 from. They surpass my preferred carrier BA by miles. Where possible my choice for intra Asia flights in future.

### "Malindo Air was the absolute best"
I have tried several low-cost airlines all around Asia and Europe, but Malindo Air was the absolute best. My first leg was a short, 1 hour flight from Langkawi to Kuala Lumpur and the aircraft was equipped with in-flight entertainment, drinks were being served and the spacious legroom was bigger than most of the ones on national airlines. On the longer leg from Kuala Lumpur to Taipei we had the same great service including one hot meal. Other low-cost airlines flying this route offered even higher fares but, from my previous experiences, a certainly lower service quality.

### "staff were attentive to passengers needs"
Flew Kota Bharu to Subang. The flight departed and arrived as scheduled. Flight was smooth except for slight turbulence a few minutes prior to descent. The captain gave 2 announcements, one while cruising and one before descent. Flight was full. Cabin was clean and cabin staff were attentive to passengers needs. The aircon was working well. Normally Malindo will offer a complimentary drink and some crackers, but this time only complimentary drinks was offered. I am more than satisfied with Malindo Air.

### "excellent value for money"
Ho Chi Minh to Jakarta via KL and I have to say that I am very impressed with Malindo Air. Although the airfare is quite similar to other budget airlines, Malindo Air provided excellent value for money. Check in was smooth without any problems (free 30 kg checked baggage for each person), plane was on schedule for both leg (HCM-KL and KL-Jakarta), and they checked my luggage all the way to Jakarta without any problem (although I have to admit that I was initially afraid that they might missed the baggage transfer as my transit time in KL is only 1 hour). The cabin is clean, more legroom compared to other budget airlines, and they have their own in-flight entertainment system. They provided food and beverages as well (flight<2 hours = snack, longer flight = hot meal). Crew were very friendly and accommodating. I definitely recommend this airline and will use Malindo Air again for future travels.

### "honesty in returning my phone "
Kuala Lumpur to Amritsar, it was my first time flying with Malindo Air. All went well in flight. As I was at the immigration counter filling up a form upon arrival I took out my phone to retrieve some information needed to fill the form. After clearing immigration and getting my luggage I decided to message my husband to tell him everything is good and realised then I do not have my phone, frantically searching, I got my sister to call my number and on the 3rd ring someone from Malindo Air, and I was so so thankful. Despite being after office hours the staff assured me he will return my phone. We headed back to a meeting point of Holiday inn where my phone was returned to me. A very special mention to the staff and his friend for the honesty shown in returning my phone and coming out of the way to do so. I never thought i would get my phone back.

### "improve customer care hotline"
The Malindo Air customer hotline is a disaster - before I departed from Malaysia I called their hotline for an query and the representative did not pick up the phone and kept me waiting online for more than 30 minutes, which is so annoying. The flight comfort was good and the staff service was satisfactory, food would be more better and overall things were good. I would like to travel again with Malindo Air but please improve your customer care hotline, since in an urgency the customer care cannot be contacted which is so frustrating.

### "no concept of customer service"
Bought the ticket from Penang to Kuala Lumpur in December 2015, was told that the flight will depart 2 hours earlier. Not what I want and try to get a refund, I was told that I can't claim refund by email, and I must contact their customer service by phone. The trouble was my phone calls were never picked up by any human, and was further informed that claim for refund must be made 72 hours before flight time. How on earth was I supposed to claim my refund my phone if my calls were never pick up? Avoid the airline, they have no concept of customer service.

### "food was horrible"
Kuala Lumpur to Mumbai and with Malindo Air - never again. The cabin crew's attitude was arrogant and ignorant. They refused to provide us with blankets saying they had very limited supply. When I called for them, without asking or listening to what I had to say, they switched off the sign and walked off. The food was horrible, absolutely no taste and poor quantity. The cabin crew even refused to refill my drink.

### "Free food, free luggage (30kg)"
I took Malindo air from KUL to DPS and they offer the same service as a legacy carrier but for a low price. Free food, free luggage (30kg) and great seat pitch (32 inches). The plane was quite new, PTV screen and very comfortable seat.

### "very friendly and helpful"
Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur with Malindo Air. I was not expecting such good service on a budget airlines. Passengers get their own personal entertainment center with decent collection. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. Not the best food I have been served on an airplane but you get what you pay for. Our flight was brought forward by half an hour which was great as we were early.

### "refused to serve a cup of tea"
Trivandrum to Kuala Lumpur. The seatbelt sign was kept on maybe to deny service to passengers. Both my flights were turbulence free throughout. The crew had no problem pushing the Duty Free cart up and down despite the seatbelt sign, but refused to serve a cup of tea.

### "still falling short in many areas"
With a much cheaper fare than CX and MH, a business class service superior to Air Asia, I had high hopes but was sadly disappointed. On this trip, I bought a one way outbound with Malindo from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur as a trial, inbound with MH. The day before the flight, they rang from the head office to take my order for the inflight meal which was impressive. Then on the morning of my travel, they rang to inform me that plane would be delayed three hours. At least I was informed early enough, so I didn't have to go to the airport, check in Hong Kong was fine, plaza premium lounge was offered. Boarding was orderly and cabin neat, crew are welcoming. For some unknown reason the flight took off half an hour later than the said time. I was further disappointed to be told all the entertainment system and in seat power were not working. Lucky I had my iPad with me to watch a film, unlucky for others. Meals delivered and was delicious but quite a small portion and quite spicy. This would be a problem for western palate who may not be used to that level of spiciness. Crew did not come around often enough to top up drinks, but at least the service was courteous. Seats are standard recliner, a little hard but fine for a three hour flight. Upon landing nearly midnight, long disorderly queue at the immigration with lots of people trying to cut queues and no officers to control the situation, Malindo didn't offer fast track like MH. Another good 45 minutes spent at just getting through immigration. Bags were delivered late, and priority bags were not delivered first, costing another half and hour. I was supposed to be in town by 8pm, turned out to be nearly 1 am, the hassle was not worth the money saved. Malindo tried their best to be in competition but still falling short in many areas and a bit amateurish. Given time, this may improve. They offer to fly to other further destinations as far away as Perth in Australia. However, given the unreliability and other matters, I'd hate to think what happen if one misses a connection and how they would handle it? For now, it's back to MH for me if going to Kuala Lumpur.

### "plenty of room to improve"
I have flown with Malindo Air several times due to having a competitive product in terms of aircraft and facilities offered. Flew from Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur. I like their seat, free meal, free inflight entertainment etc but their crew service had been disappointing. Most of the crew members were young but lacked of professionalism in terms of their attitude. They lack smiles, no eye contact with passengers and the way they communicate with passengers was not that polite. Malindo Air still have plenty of room to improve in term of customer service.

### "crew were attentive and friendly"
Flew from Penang Int to Subang Airport with Malindo Air. Flight time was about 1 hour onboard ATR72-600. Check-in was a breeze, with 15kg luggage allowance and I got the seat I booked. Boarding was quick and greeted warmly by the crew. Aircraft still new but seat pitch is small but tolerable for a short flight. Malindo serves a pack of crackers and water on short flights which was nice. The crew were attentive and friendly throughout the flight. We touched down 10 mins ahead of schedule.

### "lounge in KUL was unavailable"
Jakarta to Colombo via Kuala Lumpur with Malindo Air. The fact that the lounge in KUL was unavailable was not mentioned once when we purchased the ticket and this is no better than the attitude of the customer service staff at the transit desk. Apparently all they could do was give us a hotline number which is available on the Web and a 30RM meal voucher. So here we are spending a 7-hour transit paying for separate lounge access while flying business class - not acceptable.

### "seats and legroom were comfortable"
I flew with Malindo Air on 29 May 2016 from Kota Bharu to Subang. I had been informed 2 days earlier that my flight time had been changed from 11.25 to 11.50 am. Check in was smooth. Flight departed and landed on time. The plane was clean and tidy. The seats and legroom were comfortable. Both ground staff and cabin crews were very friendly. During the flight I was offered a complimentary drink and some crackers. Overall, it was very good service.

### "seat comfort could be improved"
Flying with a low cost carrier I did not expect much from Malindo Air but my expectations were exceeded. Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong. With their fleet of 737's they seem to fly from KLIA and not KLIA2 which is the better option. The aircraft's were very clean but the seat comfort in terms of softness could be improved as it felt a little stiff over time. Services, especially inflight were very pleasant, especially the flight attendants who were very helpful and always had smiles on their faces. There were three meal options provided on each leg and they were serving drinks at least 4 times throughout the 3.5hr flight. A few choices of Hollywood movies could have been added as five felt a bit small. From now on I will certainly prefer them over AirAsia.

### "need better customer service"
I flew from Perth to Colombo on 27th of April and was impressed with Malindo Air. The plane was new with lots of leg room in economy class. The food was good Chicken Biriyani on both sectors, and they give you 30 kilos of baggage on this route. I had nothing but good to say about this flight until I came to Colombo and I got only 1 of my suitcases - the other one is missing and it is a case of nobody knows anything about the missing baggage (now 8 days). I call the baggage section at Colombo and filled in the form etc but nobody helps with information on what the are doing to retrieve my suitcase from wherever. They need better customer service to help their passengers.

### "excellent value for money"
Flew Malindo Air from Kuala Lumpur to Lahore. Smart, comfortable, great value and great pilots. Friendly, well-dressed and neat cabin staff. Nice leather seats. 30kg free baggage and free meal. Storm erupted 5 min before landing but our pilot landed smoothly. Didn't eat as I wasn't hungry but the food looked ok. Inflight included wifi through t-mobile for the full duration at $16 but didn't use it. My seat (row 15) didn't recline as the row behind me was an exit row - avoid row 15. Excellent value for money.

### "crew were warm and friendly"
My first Business Class experience with Malindo Air was on Kuala Lumpur - Denpasar, OD306/02APR operated by a B737-900ER and returning Denpasar - Kuala Lumpur on OD307/09APR operated by a B737-800ER. The legroom on both flights is more than sufficient for the distance, however the Lumbar Support for their Business Class seats is a little bit hard compared to Malaysia Airlines B737-800ER. It takes two minutes to get used to it. The breakfast served on the outgoing flight was a bit dry. I ordered an omelette but I was served scrambled eggs instead. The dinner on the returning flight surprised me when they offered me wine while I was not expecting it - most especially after a bad experience flying Malaysia Airlines on the same route 3 months earlier where they made cutback on alcoholic beverages for flights of less than 3 hours in duration. The next surprise was that dinner was served course by course. And after that it was a continuous flow of white wine. The white coffee served on Malindo Air was delicious. The crew were all warm and friendly as well as being very professional. The kebayas make them look so very elegant and charming. Malindo Air is definitely making its way to a full service carrier. What Malaysia Airlines has taken from you in their Business Class service cutbacks, Malindo Air has added them: e.g Salt & Pepper Shakers on the meal trays and of course, Wine. Overall, I am more than satisfied with Malindo Air and will definitely give them priority for destinations which they cover. I hope to see them expand to more destinations in Indonesia as well as launch flights to Taiwan.

### "cabin crew are extremely friendly"
Penang to Tiruchirapally via Kuala Lumpur with Malindo Air. The check in process was very fast and ground crew very friendly. When I board both aircrafts, I can feel that it is extremely hot in both cabins. The cup cake served on the flight from PEN to KUL was tasteless. The in flight entertainment was not turned on for the PEN to KUL flight too. The food served for KUL to TRZ was the same as the previous flight, I really hope that Malindo Air can change the types of food offered on its flights. But the cabin crew are extremely friendly and helpful. The legroom is extremely big too.

### "impressed with this airline"
My family and I flew with Malindo Air from Kochi to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur return on 27th March. I'm extremely impressed with this airline from the check-in process to the flight itself. The features that impressed me were the seat leg space, inflight entertainment system with touch screen and complimentary food. Cabin crew were extremely polite and friendly. However the cabin was a bit hot at times, and they could broaden the range of movies and televsion shows, although it was sufficient for a 4 hr 15 mins flight. Other than that, it was an enjoyable and relaxing flight and the only flight from Kochi that I really enjoyed. I would recommend this airline and would fly with them again.

### "crew smart and most professional"
I did a one day trip Kuala Lumpur Subang to Penang return on 27FEB, which happened to be the first time on Malindo Air. The crew on both segments were very smart and most professional. Due to the short domestic flight, I didn't expect much in terms of meals; so, the water and snack was most adequate. My only gripe is the tight legroom.

### "not honoured flexi fare ticket"
Malindo Air have not honoured my flexi fare ticket. Having booked a return flight to Bali from Kuala Lumpur, and having booked the return part of that journey as a flexible fare; I have been told that despite me having been offered and paid for a return flexible ticket (which gives the option of a free change of date), I still have to pay for both the change and the fare difference because the outward journey was a promo fare. Apparently no matter what I paid for the second leg (which was not discounted), the flexi ticket is invalid despite being more expensive. So what is the point of being offered a flexi ticket for my return flight in the first place?

### "cabin crew very friendly"
The baggage check in process went on smoothly without any problem, but I'm not quite satisfied with the weighing of my hand luggage. Weighing of my luggage didn't happened during my previous flight in December 2015. The ground staff and cabin crew were very friendly. The flight departed on time and reach KLIA before the estimated time of arrival. The seat was very comfortable and I like the Boeing Sky Interior. I feel that Malindo Air choice of moving from KLIA2 to KLIA Main Terminal is a wise one. The food served is still the same as before, perhaps Malindo Air can change the types of food served during its flights.

### "well dressed and smiling staff"
We flew from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok return with Malindo Air. We were warmly welcomed by well dressed and smiling staff. The seats were leather and legroom very spacious. As our flight was just under 2.5 hours, we did not have a meal but we were given a drink and a bread bun. The entertainment was good and we were able to start watching before take-off. I would recommend Malindo Air and will definitely be using them again the next time I am in Asia.

### "seats and legroom comfortable"
The baggage check in process was fast. The boarding process also runs smoothly. The seats and legroom were more comfortable if compared with that of Air Asia. Both ground staff and cabin crews were very friendly. The food served was tasty too. But the inflight entertainment system was not working properly, got hanged after an hour after using, asked the cabin crew to reset it but to no avail. The air conditioner in the plane seems like not working properly too, it's quite hot in the plane.

### "better than service from Air Asia"
Value for money. It operates as a full service airline. Not sure why it is operating from KLIA2. Cabin crew were friendly, departure was on time and meals were reasonably good. Much better than service I had received from Air Asia. I couldn't complaint about the ground staff either. No complaints

### "value for money"
Flew Malindo Air from Kuala Lumpur to Perth. Comfort and value for money. New route with new aircraft, only budget airline with business class and lounge in KLIA 2. Several aircraft's bought by Malindo Air to serve new route, brand new Boeing 737 with comfortable cabin seat with quality cabin crew.

### "staff were friendly"
Malindo Air staff were friendly. I fly from Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur on the 6th February there is a slight delay. The seats for Malindo were quite comfortable. But it only delayed about 45 minutes and we arrive at KLIA at 11.45pm.

### "Highly recommended"
Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar with Malindo Air was truly a big surprise. Known as a budget airline, the plane was practically new and well equipped. Leg room was enormous and the seats were just great. 30kg check-in baggage allowance (up to 2 bags) is also a big bonus. Highly recommended indeed.

### "is much preferred"
Trichy to Kuala Lumpur with Malindo Air. The seats, meals and service was good. Good space for legs, and seat recline was also decent enough for good sleep. Flight entertainment was loaded with good movies and different languages with subtitles. Delay was informed a day before. Compared to other low-cost airlines, I would say Malindo Air is much preferred.

### "Very good service"
Kuala Terengganu to Kuala Lumpur on Malindo Air. Possibly the best low-cost airline I have flown. I booked a flight the day before I was due to depart because of a sudden cancellation of another flight and I had an extraordinarily cheap fare. the plane was in good conditions and the seats were comfortable. During the flight we were offered a complimentary drink and some crackers, the flight took off and landed on time and during the flight it was considerably less noisy than expected. We had a free luggage allowance in addition to the cabin allowance and our luggage arrived in the hall with us. Very good service.

### "all up a pleasant experience"
Kuala Lumpur to Perth and the first time using Malindo Air. For a budget airline found the experience to be quite pleasant. A new plane, seating quite comfortable, entertainment system worked well. Cabin was too hot while on tarmac, but was quite comfortable after takeoff. The service left and arrived on time. The Stewards were readily available to serve refreshments on request. All up a pleasant experience. I prefer flying in a wide body jet if I have the choice.

### "an okay experience"
Malindo Air from Delhi to Langkawi return via Kuala Lumpur for a holiday. Cheap fares and very punctual. Convenient overnight flight out of DEL as well. Food was forgettable, and IFE scant but still existent. Seats were okay but design was somewhat tacky. The smaller ATR operated Langkawi to KL was fairly comfortable as well. Hard landings on all occasions. Baggage not loaded onto our return flight and delivered with next day's flight. For its fares, its an okay experience.

### "amazing staff"
Kuala Lumpur to Krabi via Penang. It was my first time using Malindo Air. The flight departed on time from Kuala Lumpur and we made a quick stop in Penang, Malaysia. Onboard we were served a bottle of water and a snack. The service on board was excellent for a budget airline. The plane was a very small plane with two small engines but this did not compromise leg room. In total we took four flights with them throughout our trip to Krabi and back. Great airline with amazing staff at very good prices. I will fly with them again.

### "Malindo did not bother"
I travelled on flight 802 from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur yesterday. The flight was fine but my luggage was delayed at KLIA2 for over an hour because of the rain. Granted the luggage handlers are not under your purview but what was even more amazing was the lack of knowledge from the ground staff on what was going on. There were quite a number of passengers waiting patiently at belt 6. Unlike AirAsia, who made numerous announcements and had staff available at the luggage belts to try to assist. Malindo did not bother. Eventually luggage started coming out from belt 6 but they were from AirAsia flights. None were from Malindo which caused some confusion but passengers continued to wait. Then some passengers informed the rest the luggage came out via large item belt at the corner where Malindo lost luggage office is. No Malindo staff bothered to inform the passengers nor made any announcements.

### "is an excellent airline"
Malindo Air never failed to offer low fair for this particular route (KUL-BKI), this hotly contested air route remained expensive throughout the year. My flight with Malindo Air without any problem, the inflight meal was only a light snack for a 2 hour and 30 minute flight. The inflight entertainment was good, but cut-off time was too early for such flight, some airlines will let you to view the IE from gate to gate, but not Malindo Air. The seat was good, legroom was excellent. The cabin was spotless and managed to get some light nap throughout the flight. There was an onboard meal that you can purchase either via online preflight book or on the spot purchase, but the options was a bit limited. The crew was professional, but still a lot of room for improvement. Malindo Air is an excellent airline which offers a rock bottom price but better services as compared to other low cost carrier.

### "poor time management"
Malindo Air has poor time management. I received re-timed notification as soon as i booked the flight to depart from SIN to KUL at 9:30pm day before I travel. On departure day, counter check with crew when I check in from SIN and she insisted flight will be on time because it been re-timed from 9:30pm to 11:10pm. It is late for business traveller because its gonna be midnight when I reach home. As expected, flight got re-timed again to 11:55pm and by the time I reach home and settle down is probably 3am.

### "flight was pretty good"
After a terrible experience with Malaysia Airlines on the KUL-BOM leg, chose to fly Malindo Air on the return BOM-KUL leg. Booked an exit row seat and the flight was pretty good. I was not hungry so skipped the meal, the IFE was decent but the selection is limited. The crew was polite and the check-in was smooth with a 30 kg baggage allowance. The seats could be a bit more supportive for added comfort but its a small gripe. Definitely a much better experience compared to Malaysia Airlines and given that more often than not its just 60-70% of the price its completely worth it.

### "very pleasantly surprised"
Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur. I used Malindo Air as an emergency replacement for Jetstar (who elected to continually cancel the daily DPS-SIN route for at least 2 weeks straight this month whilst blaming the ash cloud). Very pleasantly surprised with Malindo Air - luggage included, IFE for short haul, friendly cabin staff and would use again

### "rethink their travels"
I booked to travel Kuala Lumpur to Kathmandu with Malindo Air, good times and price, but 1 week before the flight they pushed back the time by 30hrs. When I rang to cancel and get a refund I was told a refund would take 90 working days. This is unacceptable and I would never fly Malindo Air again.

### "crew polite and cheerful"
Tiruchirappalli to Kuala Lumpur with Malindo Air. New aircraft with cool lighting options. The check in at Trichy was smooth and easy with their ground stafs. Cabin crew was polite and cheerful. The best part comes in disguise of their seat pitch and the IFE. Food was not that flavoured but certainly not bad. On time service and pretty quick check out at KLIA Terminal 2. Overall worth for wat I paid for.

### "the crew try their best"
Malindo Air is the only budget airline to supply business class on the Singapore to Kuala Lumpur route. Even though it is a budget airline, in business class the crew still attempt to go the extra mile. Sadly, their options are limited, but the crew try their best. Business class cabin will be close to empty, but they use KLIA2 - the Kuala Lumpur terminal best avoided. Chaos, complimented by many budget air travelers. The typical old regional business class seats are not very clean. I dropped a pen between the seats and when running my fingers through it to find my pen, I had to fight through many layers of old peanuts, dust and other food leftovers. They do not have a lounge at KLIA2 (yet?). Weirdly enough though, when you call them, they will state they have. Only when asking where it is, they get confused as they find they can’t answer this question. After many questions their reply is changed to “will have”. Note I flew some time ago, so by now they may have. Sadly, if you want to check by calling them, you can’t trust their answer. Solely based on using KLIA2, I do not recommend this airline. I just don’t like that terminal. If using main terminal, I would have no issue recommending these flights.

### "won't get the refund"
In October 2015 I was about to have a flight from Bangkok to Kathmandu via Kuala Lumpur with Malindo Air. Three hours before the flight I was informed (at the airport) that my flight from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur was cancelled by Malindo Air due to operation issues. As a result, I had to take a later flight andd therefore would miss. The first reaction of the ground staff was that I had to buy a new ticket to Kathmandu! After half hour of arguing they decided that they can arrange a substitute flight from Kuala Lumpur on the next day. From the office of Malindo Air in Kuala Lumpur refused to provide or refund any accommodation for the night. It was even said to me by a Malindo Air employee that there are many places where people sleep in the airport and I should find one. On the next day, before the fight, they promised I'll get a refund for the cancelled first flight. After writing them an email regarding the refund, I got the response that I won't get the refund and they cited the airline policy regarding changed schedule which is absurd!

### "offer some great promo airfares"
Malindo Air offer some great promo airfares and we were lucky enough to get tickets from Subang to Penang return, cheaper than bus or train. And that included 15kg luggage. We were seated in row 18 on the return flight. That has plenty legroom. During the flight some biscuits and water are served. There's a magazine to read in tth seat pocket, so the time in the air passed quickly.You can buy a coffee. Flights were on time each way.

### "personal screen entertainment, but no headphones"
Firstly, the Malindo Air check-in counter was not indicated on the boards. I had to walk all over the terminal, and almost couldn't find it because the screens above were blank! Was told there something was broken but they could have easily written on a piece of paper and stuck it up! Fortunately, check-in was quick. Bought a meal on board. The first thing I find was a piece of omelette that was a step away from becoming leather, and the chicken was terrible. They have personal screens and entertainment, but no headphones. As good as not having any.

### "dissatisfied with hospitality"
I was travelling Malindo Air from Trivandrum to Kuala Lumpur on 31st August and was dissatisfied with hospitality of cabin staff. I have travelled many airlines, but this shouldn't mean that on a low fare airlins the passangers are ill treated. The crew members was not friendly, grumpy faces and irritable tone in speaking to the passangers.

### Malindo Air customer review
My wife and I am, we are both frequent flyers with Malindo Air from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Cabin Crews are very friendly.

### Malindo Air customer review
We got the cheapest flight from Kl to Kuching. Flight took off on time and was almost full. Very comfortable seat and legroom compared to Air Asia. Some refreshments enough since we slept throughout the flight. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Extra 15kg free checked baggage is very helpful.

### Malindo Air customer review
SIN-KUL. At time of booking this was the cheapest fare I could find, including budget airlines considered. Was pleasantly surprised to be assigned the exit seat, even more surprised to find that the aircraft was waiting for me to board (usually the other way round for all other flights). Aircraft looked brand new, IFE was worthy for long-haul travel. Simple snack and drink was provided and crew was friendly. Service comparable to legacy airlines and I would definitely fly with them again.

### Malindo Air customer review
Flown Malindo from KLIA2 to Don Mueng. The check-in agent at KLIA2 was terrible and unprofessional. I was shocked that the agent were more interested in staring at their iPhone than greeting their customers. Was traveling with another two companions and we checked-in together. However, our seats were different and once airborne, we were surprised that there were so many empty seats at towards the end of the plane. Inflight service was a different story altogether. The cockpit crew and the cabin crew really interacted with the passengers and were very friendly. Malindo has a PTV for each seat and they provided great IFE for a short flight.

### Malindo Air customer review
Connection flight from Kuala Lumpur to Kochi was re-timed to be one hour later, but I received an e-mail notification and a phone call from airline staff, before the start of the journey. Though I was travelling business class, no lounge was available in KL, I had to wait in the crowded common transit area. The transfer desk at KL was unmanned. On the return lap, my baggage was delayed. I had waited at the belt expecting my bag, to realize after a wait of half an hour that my bag did not arrive. There was no airline representative available near the belt, managed to locate the ground handling representative's office to join a queue with many other passengers with the same plight. There was only one staff at this office, causing further delay.

### Malindo Air customer review
SIN-KUL in Economy Class on June 13th. The aircraft was a new Boeing 737-800. Economy Class seats were comfortable with excellent legroom and pitch. Each seat was fitted with touchscreen  inflight entertainment but the system was not turned on. A packet of cookies and water were offered. Staff  service was courteous. For the price paid (S$44.00 per adult return) Malindo Air offered brilliant value for money.

### Malindo Air customer review
I've travel many times with Malindo. The first time was superb. On schedule staff fairly professional. Plane was new and comfy. However last January my flight was supposed to take off at 1pm but they emailed me to inform that the flight been re-timed - two hours later. In the end my flight took off at almost 11pm (10 hours plus delay). Reached Kota Kinabalu 12.30am in the morning. Terrible experience. My following flight with Malindo's turboprop from Subang was not that bad. Delayed a bit but still tolerable. Lately I noticed that Malindo often re-schedule their flights at the last minute. If you are flexible with time I recommend you fly Malindo.

### Malindo Air customer review
I travelled 3 times from Kuala Lumpur to Kuching via Malindo. First 2 times were great inflight entertainment and food was good. However for the 3rd flight they rescheduled my flight from a night flight to a mid noon flight. To make that flight I had to take leave from work which was not possible for me. I had to book through Air Asia for my original time instead. Will never fly with Malindo unless I'm not bothered with timing.

### Malindo Air customer review
I flew OD804 SIN-KUL and it was one of the best flying experiences I've had. Flight was on time cabin crew were very friendly and attentive throughout the short flight. IFE was working great! Worth my every penny spent. Highly recommended!

### Malindo Air customer review
Expect some delays in the flight taking off (Cochin to KUL April 2015). Flight offered reasonable food and excellent leg room which was almost like being in business class. Luggage handling was also excellent with normal check-in. Suggested areas for improvement are: 1) To create a reasonable menu. 2) Competitive offers to attract frequent travelers etc. 3) More friendly m-commerce apps for easy check-in.

### Malindo Air customer review
Took Malindo Air from Langkawi to Subang today and flight was overbooked. How could they have overbooked a flight with only 72 seats? Will never use this airline again unless I don't have a choice.

### Malindo Air customer review
I am tall and have problems on many other low cost airlines but not with Malindo. The flight was on time the service was good. True there was no inflight entertainment but I only took short flights which were about the same cost as a bus but much shorter in time. I would with Malindo again and I have recommended them often.

### Malindo Air customer review
Took Malindo from SIN to KTM via KUL. Flight from Singapore was delayed for 1hr 45mins. I had only a 1hr transit time in KUL. I informed the ground staff. When I arrived in KUL ground staff were waiting for me and brought me to the gate quickly. Baggage also arrived promptly. Return flight departed KTM early arrived in KUL 45mins ahead of schedule. Flight to Singapore was short and simple. Food not too bad. Entertainment good. Excellent legroom. Overall comfortable.

### Malindo Air customer review
OD305/231 12 Jan. We flew Bali-KK-Codine. Check-in was quick and easy bags checked through. Boarding was organised once onboard modern light aircraft crew were ok not over friendly. Legroom was great I'm 191cm tall - was fine great entertainment. Meal service didn't get to us on first flight due to turbulence second flight was all edible. Bars arrived on time no complaints.

### Malindo Air customer review
I travelled by Malindo on the TRZ-KUL-TRZ route and it was a very pleasant flight (as far as the airline is concerned). The seats are very spacious the legroom is very good and overall very comfortable (I am extra extra heavy and I felt extremely comfortable in it). The food was a surprise and good too (on the KUL-TRZ line). The cabin crew could definitely do a bit of more friendliness but then I can't blame them considering the passengers they were serving weren't exactly at their best behavior. The in-flight entertainment system was also a surprise and of good quality. The let down was the fact that the cost for the headsets is not explicitly informed. The TRZ- KUL flight was exactly on time and check-in was quite a breeze at the TRZ airport. The return flight was delayed by a couple of hours and proper announcements were not made but for the information on the display board. But one can live with it. The in-flight announcements were in an English I could not quite understand (I do not know why all airline English announcements are this way) and in Malay and Indonesian I guess. I do not see the logic considering 90% of the passengers would not have understood any of the 3 languages the announcements were made in. Overall a very pleasant and comfortable journey. But then it was a very short one.

### Malindo Air customer review
OD 1235 on 25 Dec. Short flight from Kota Bharu to Subang. Flight was on time despite bad weather conditions and flooding on the East Coast. The cabin crews were attentive. Good fare for ATR flight. Landed at Subang airport and it was convenient and near to KL Downtown.

### Malindo Air customer review
I was on flight OD231/232 from COK-KUL-COK last week was pretty sceptical in the beginning due to many negative reviews I came across. Nevertheless I must say that the flight was very OK (in terms of value for money) staff were very friendly and approachable. Food was not bad either the delay was tolerable too no missing baggage etc.. Would fly with Malindo again.

### Malindo Air customer review
We boarded Malindo Air for return trip Subang to Krabi. During the return there was a connecting flight in Penang. The check in staff at Krabi airport offered us direct luggage transfer service and assured us the luggage will be auto transfer to Subang. Counter staff in Krabi also asked us to verify / reconfirm in Penang airport with the counter staff. Upon arrival in Penang airport we immediately went to counter to verify but being told by counter staff "there is no such procedure" and asked us to retrieve our luggage at luggage collection point!! We were surprised and frustrated as Malindo staff in Krabi assured us it would be done. We could not find our luggage so we had to returned to Penang Malindo counter. Upon pressuring the staff and show them the boarding pass again only they were able to confirm that our luggage was indeed auto transfer. Overall we were very disappointed with the first reply by staff "there is no such procedure". This incident caused us panicked and created unnecessary worry. On top of that flight was cancelled from 18 Dec and rescheduled to 19 Dec without prior information. This trip was our first booking and yet we experienced 2 incidents already hence we are not sure if we would recommend Malindo Air to our friends/family.

### Malindo Air customer review
JHB-PEN (via SZB). Booked my flight the night prior and it came to about 140 RM for a flight from JB to Penang. Two flights connecting at Subang. The flight attendants were lovely and professional and a snack (water and sweet biscuits) was a welcome addition (not to mention the included baggage). Opted to try Malindo over Air Asia on the last feature. Only problem was due to a slight delay on the JHB-SZB leg I had to rush through Subang airport. They didn't appear to have a transfer option and I was on a 50 min transfer window period. Running 20 minutes late. I had to get out past baggage collection and then back through security again. Luckily no problems. Same crew on the next flight so they get the same compliments as above! Plane appeared quite new although some of the seats recline of their own volition.

### Malindo Air customer review
KBR-SZB-KBR it was my first flight experience. The crew were friendly efficient and helpful. However there was no entertainment at all and the seat was not spacious.

### Malindo Air customer review
KL to DEL on 22nd Oct. There was a delay of 2 hours because of some unruly passengers. They were taken off the airplane. When it came to lunchtime the Vegetarian food finished however there were still about 15 passengers who wanted that meal. The chief air hostess explained we had 2 options - either take the chicken meal or purchase the noodles. There was only 1 toilet functioning on the flight.

### Malindo Air customer review
I was supposed to travel with my family from Cochin to KUL on 13th Oct 2014 but I got a call from an airline rep on 12th Oct 8.30 pm saying that our flight has been cancelled due to "technical issues" and stated that I could either travel the next night from Cochin or the next morning from Trichy (which is 350 kms away). We had no choice but to choose the flight the next morning from Trichy since we did not want to waste an entire day of our short pre-booked vacation. We reached Trichy airport by 8 am (our flight time was 10.30 am) and that flight was delayed by 3 hours. Never had such a bad experience with any airline before. The plane however was new and had good seats and very good leg room. (Good for a low cost airline). I would have given a positive review if it hadn't been for the cancellation and delay.

### Malindo Air customer review
My flight was bound from KUL to DPS on 28/9/14 09.20hrs flight. Flight was delayed for 30minutes due to 2 missing passengers and air crew did not make an announcement on the delay. Flight attendant asked for our boarding pass to check through their passenger list and this continued 3 times throughout the 30 minutes. After searching for the 2 missing passengers no one came onboard and the flight departed. Upon reaching our destination we were not given the immigration form so we asked for it. The flight crew came with a Malay declaration form and I told her we need it to be an English version to my surprise she told me its the same I rejected and insisted I needed it to be an English version. So after a good 5 minutes she passed me an English declaration form. Asking politely for a pen she brushed me off by telling me someone had taken her pen and she did not have one at the moment and returned to her business class seat with the remaining crew. Staff were not attentive to passengers needs and crowded in the Business class seating and chatted with the curtain closed. This was the worst inflight service I have come across.

### Malindo Air customer review
Flew on August 14 to Delhi in business class. Return flight on 22nd also in business. Outstanding crew very efficient and helpful. Crew were happy for a chat. Food was great with Hagen Daz as ice cream for dessert which was a surprise. They also provided us with hot towel and peanuts for a snack with pre departure drinks. The premium lounge in Delhi airport was basic but comfortable and nice. The seats are comfortable for a 737. Overall will certainly fly Malindo again.

### Malindo Air customer review
I travelled from Mumbai to Bali via KL. They offer hot meals on BOM-KUL-BOM sector while only a cracker on KUL - Bali sector. Seat leg clearances are good in economy. However the airline lost my baggage and its been over 10 days and they still haven't bothered to keep me updated! Supposedly the airline has been loosing lot of passengers baggage. Hence I would recommend you not to travel with them.

### Malindo Air customer review
I flew from Bangladesh to Thailand via Malaysia. They canceled the outward leg on the day of travel and then the return leg. I had to make my own way to another airport next day (7 hours by bus). On the way back they did help me get an internal flight to my destination airport and a hotel overnight as I had to wait. These cancellations are regular. The aircraft they operate are nice and new. Staff are professional. The food is fine. Inflight entertainment is from a limited selection. One nice feature is that you can charge from a USB socket in your entertainment console. But the amps are very low so you only get a tiny charge.

### Malindo Air customer review
June 26 2014. One-way KUL-DPS in Economy class. Check-in at KLIA 2 was swift but I did check-in online the day before as well. Long lines at Immigration counters. Reminded me of Bali. Boarding call followed on time and our flight left KUL 10 minutes late but we arrived on-time in Bali. Overall nice flight experience. 32 inch seat pitch was comfortable for a tall person like me. Seat reclines and comes with in-seat entertainment. Even offers an USB connection which usually is only available in Business Class. Free meal service was only crackers and water. Other meals and drinks were available for a charge. Would book Malindo Air again.

### Malindo Air customer review
Overall an ok flight. KUL-CGK return. Ample legroom seat can be reclined interior calm cabin crew friendly and responsive. IFE working various selection but not that interesting. Check in at KLIA counter was hassle free but not on the way back from Jakarta. There was no clear signage as to where the Malindo check in counter was and the check in process was so slow that we only managed to board our flight during final call. Luckily we didn't miss our flight back. For a 2 hour flight only refreshment given was a mineral water and crackers. You need to purchase a meal.

### Malindo Air customer review
OD1155. PEN-SZB on 3/2/2014 scheduled at 15.20. Delayed to 17.20 and delayed to unconfirmed time. Finally depart after 22.00 but to Langkawi and finally landed KUL at 01.00 instead. Terrible experience.

### Malindo Air customer review
KUL-DEL on economy and DEL-KUL on business. Overall a good flight although I think the economy seats are great in terms of legroom but the chair was way uncomfortable even though they do have slight reclining. Food choices aren't great on economy as expected due to budget airline but flight attendants are extremely warm and helpful. They should think about giving the passengers on economy a blanket and small pillow too.

### Malindo Air customer review
Trip was a breeze. Staff friendly. There were screens but could not access because no head/earphones provided. It would be good to inform passengers to bring their own. Food and beverages could be better with better selection of snacks.

### Malindo Air customer review
KUL-BKI-KUL. Checked in with not many problems even on a busy morning in the main terminal of KLIA. Plane was on time and almost full. Meals were served 30 minutes after take off which was only mineral water and a bun for a 2.5 hour flight. Service was fair but not very welcoming. FA's lacked smiles and were robotic. Very limited IFE selection. Overall I will use them again.

### Malindo Air customer review
JHB-KUL-JHB with the new Boeing 737-900ER. Seat was comfortable and a good legroom. Flight attendant was moderate and provided only biscuits and mineral water but enough for short-haul flight. IFE was good while without many choice compare to other airlines. In just RM198 for round trip I can get these service and also 15kg free check-in baggage. Would recommend.

### Malindo Air customer review
KCH-KUL. Seat was comfortable good legroom. Crew service was nothing special. Service was pretty slow. Only 2 cabin crew in economy class section. Very poor service compared to my previous flight. IFE was good with a lot of choices.

OD 161 DAC-KUL 31 Oct 2013. OD 162 KUL-DAC 6 Nov 2013. Check-in was a breeze. Brand new Boeing 737-900 ER aircraft with very attentive FAs. You can buy a hot meal just for a few ringgits. Overall impression: Very good.

### Malindo Air customer review
KUL-PEN. Overall ok compared to other competitors. Check in was smooth new fleet they give priority for travelers with small children first in KLIA but not on our return flight in Penang airport. Unfortunately we already pre-booked seats and paid RM5.00 for each seat but at check in they gave us different seats. Luckily we were given seats on the first row for economy class with extra leg room. Boarding time a bit delayed. Overall quite satisfied inflight service - excellent.

### Malindo Air customer review
An ok flight with them flew on OD1158 from Subang Skypark (SZB) to Penang Int'l (PEN) using their brand new ATR72-600. Nice check in agent in Subang and excellent cabin condition. The flight took one hour and they served water and fruit cake slices for that short duration of flight. Cabin crew a little bit inexperienced we can tell that. other than that nice flight. Will be flying with their B737-900ER to Kuching next week and looking forward to that.

KCH-KUL. On 13/8/2013 second time experience with this airline which was better than previous flight. Seat comfortable as usual. Good legroom. Better cabin crew service very friendly with smiles and efficiency. ICE had a lot of choices. Highly recommended. Would fly this airline again.

KUL-KCH. 3 August 2013. My first experience with this airline. Very good experience. A very comfortable seat with good legroom. Better than Malaysia Airlines narrow body aircarft. Their service was not very professional quite robotic lack of smiles and poor English. Catering was nothing special just a bottle of water and a sandwich. Good variety of inflight entertainment. What makes me like this airlines is the interior design especially the mood lighting sky interior. Very calm and enjoyable. Just like a full service carrier. Highly recommended. Would fly this airline again.

Flight was comfortable though a 3 hour delay from Kuching to Kuala Lumpur. The snack and drinks were a welcome gesture only hope the water portion could be bigger. The seats was comfy though the flight attendants need to be trained further in assisting people whom require help with overhead baggage.

KUL to KCH. A relatively new airline operating with Boeing's new B737-900ER fleet. I had to be at the airport 2 hours earlier as online check-in was still unavailable. Flight was delayed for about 30 minutes and no announcement on the delay was made. Cabin crews were notably new and rather inexperienced. They can certainly improve on the aspect of professionalism and communication skills when serving passengers. Inflight entertainment is available with a personal TV on each seat. Understandably a low cost airline but in some ways it does not seem to be 'low cost'.

KUL-KCH-KUL my flight was excellent with smooth check in large legroom free snack and the best is we departed from the main airport KLIA. Keep it up Malindo Air.
