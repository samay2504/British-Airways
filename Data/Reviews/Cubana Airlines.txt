### "do not plan to fly with Cubana again"
Santiago de Cuba to Havana. My wife and I spent three weeks wandering Cuba and, overall, had a wonderful time filled with exceptional experiences... our flight with Cubana Airlines was not one of those experiences. If it were only the close to two hour delay we experienced (apparently this is a regular occurrence with Flight 205, Santiago to Habana), then I wouldn't be writing this negative review. The fact that they detained us and all their other delayed customers in a very hot, stuffy room with no air conditioning or fans... I'd be willing to let that slide. Even having to wait an extra hour at the baggage carousel for our checked bags wouldn't have inspired me... but after discovering that items had been stolen from both my bag & my wife's is when my real issue began. I personally picked up both my backpack & my wife's and carried them myself to our waiting taxi. I put them in the trunk of our taxi, where they stayed until we arrived at our destination. I was present when our driver opened his trunk & I then picked up both bags and carried them to our room, no one else touched our bags as soon as they were back in our custody and when we arrived in our room and began unpacking I we discovered items missing. All the items just so happened to be in the most easily accessed compartments of our bags. Unless our driver had someone hiding in his trunk then the theft had to have occurred while our bags were in Cubana Airline's custody. The next morning I contacted Cuba Travel Services (who we booked our tickets through) and they told me to send an email as soon as I got home, which I did. The folks at Cuba Travel Services were responsive and helpful, I believe they did all they could do, but an cannot offer any similar compliments for Cubana Airlines. After filing our theft claim we didn't hear back from Cubana Airlines for over a month at which point they explained that since I didn't file a claim at the airport in Havana, they weren't willing to do anything. I found this response unsatisfactory and absurd for a number of reasons, one being that there would be no reason for me to unpack our bags at the baggage carousel, so how could I possibly discover that we had items missing? Cubana Airlines only reached out to Cuba Travel Services, they made no effort to contact me directly, they have offered no compensation for the theft nor have they truly expressed any regret or apologies. They don't even seem concerned that they have employees handling customer's bags and stealing items while in their custody. I have almost nothing but wonderful things to say about Cuba and its people, but I have no love for Cubana AIrlines and while we plan to return to Cuba we do not plan to fly with Cubana again.

### "first and last experience"
Not Verified | Madrid to Havana. Myself and my girlfriend had wanted to go to Cuba for some time and in 2015 we realised our dream to visit the island. We decided on flying with Cubana from Madrid to Havana and return so as to spend a couple of days in Madrid on our return journey through Madrid. I booked our flights which were scheduled for a Saturday departure from Madrid and booked our connecting flights from Dublin to Madrid with Ryanair. A few weeks before departure I received an email notifying me that the flight had changed as was now leaving Madrid on Friday. This change of plan cost me another €200 in new flights with Ryanair. Got to Madrid, checked in for our flight and after about an hours delay we were on our way on board an Ilyushin Il-96 with the smell of stale urine emanating from the toilets. Fast forward 2 weeks later and we find ourselves back at Havana airport for the 10pm flight back to Madrid. The tired old Il-96 is towed on to the stand and shortly after boarding commences. Engines are started, we push back off stand and a few minutes later return to stand. Everybody disembarks and sits in the terminal awaiting news of our flight. Very little info is forthcoming from official sources but a helpful fellow passenger explains to us what is happening. The flight is delayed then cancelled. We get a voucher for a roll but little else. We bed down for the night on uncomfortable airport seats as no hotel or accommodation is offered. Not much sleep was had and after a 14 hour delay we finally take off for Madrid arriving at around 3.30 in the morning. We were both given a form to fill in presumably to claim for compensation which I posted to the airline but I never got a reply. All in all, Cubana despite being the cheapest option to Havana ended up costing me more because of their schedule change and offered nothing in the way of compensation for the 14 hour delay on our return. That was our first and last experience with Cubana, you have been warned!

### "never fly this company again"
Santiago to Havana. We would never fly this company again. We were flying from Santiago De Cuba to Havana, and that same day from Havana to Paris. The flight from Santiago De Cuba was with Cubana Airlines. This flight was delayed 2 times and it took 2 hours instead of 1:30 hours. We were never informed of why this was happening. Because of these delays we missed our other flight to Paris and had to pay a lot of money for a new ticket. We would not recommend flying with them AT ALL. Apparently they are almost always late and/or the flights are cancelled.

### "would never fly with them again"
Havana to Buenos Aires. I had no trouble with the schedule departure time. Aircraft is a Russian aircraft. Uncomfortable. No entertainment. Food was the worst I've ever seen or tasted for a premium cabin. Toilet was old, dirty. The flight attendants were ok but it doesn't make you feel you are in a premium cabin. They took the food that was left, with them. These people are hungry in their country. I would never fly with them again. Not for pleasure, not for work.

### "I would fly Cubana at any time"
Toronto to Caya Coco. Flight out, on time. Staff provided a lovely breakfast sandwich with juice and dessert. Coffee/water served for free. Beer wine offered at a very modest price. Touchdown early. On return, again flight on time, arrival very early than expected - sandwich lunch again for no charge and coffee and water. With all the other airlines charging for every scrap of amenities I don’t understand what people complain about, And the washrooms did not smell! I would fly Cubana at any time.

### "duration of the delay was severe"
Toronto to Santiago de Cuba, Jan 25th 2018 Flight 191 - departure scheduled for 12:55 - actual lift off from runway at 4am Jan 26 - apparently technical/mechanical difficulties with the aircraft that arrived, on time, to fly us there; plane eventually towed away for repairs and etc - passengers were at least issued lunch and dinner vouchers for $20 each. But the duration of the delay was severe - by the time we got to SCU, disembarked from the aircraft and got out to the luggage carousel, a number of passengers then discovered that their luggage had not arrived with the flight - details were recorded, by hand, at the airport lost & found, for each passenger but no claim forms issued, no receipts provided, no information or other assistance of any use provided; just a lot of throwing up of the arms into the air. Passengers on this flight lost a full day of their vacation as well as a hotel room night, both of which they'd already paid for and did not receive. Trying to get meaningful information on the whereabouts of the missing luggage and when it would be delivered to us at our hotel was met with mostly uninformative dismissiveness - complaints have been lodged with the tour operator and the airline. Tour operator and airline should be providing complainants with better levels of compensation than just meal vouchers after all that we have been through. On this episode, you get a 1 - will still be using the tour operator and the airline; but come on people!

### "we were refused boarding"
We could not book our seats together online or on the phone, so we had to go to their office in Havana, which was chaotic to say the least and the staff were rude. When we got to the airport we were in a huge queue, which snaked around the terminal. When we finally made it to the front of the queue, we were refused boarding because we did not have a print out of our ticket out of Costa Rica! There's no WIFI at Havana Airport and we could not use the data on our UK mobile phones to retrieve the details of our booked AA tickets out of Costa Rica (AA staff on the ground would not help us either). We went to see the Cubana manager in his office, and he was rude and did not care that we were stranded. We explained we were waiting for a text message from a friend with the flight info out of Costa Rica, but he did not care. They are obviously operating a scam to get people to pay twice at huge prices or free up seats they can resell. There were other people in the same terrible situation as us on the day. Once refused departure, we could not get on another Cubana flight for 4 days so we ended up having to buy an expensive ticket with a different airline to get to Costa Rica, as by then we'd received our flight details from Costa Rica. Never again! Avoid like the plague!

### "never again fly with Cubana"
Cubana Airlines is the worst airline I ever flew with. We used the airline for a domestic flight within Cuba (Havanna to Holguin). The flight was around 5,5 hours delayed, the airline communicated nothing in advance and never said sorry for the circumstances. They offered no free drinks or a snack, the information at the airport in Havanna was horrible. They only changed the departure time on the monitors. In Holguin the pilot was not able to meet to runway in the first attempt and needed a second landing. In Holguin Cubana needed 45 minutes to bring the luggage to us. My leather bag was impured with white color. Nobody at the Holguin airport, no employee of Cubana felt responsible to help me. For safety reasons I would avoid dmestic flights in Cuba. They had no print tickets and wrote our boarding pass with a pen! At the safety check they dont want to see my passport! I will never again fly with Cubana and can't recommend this company to you.

### "our luggage was lost"
Upon arrival to Cayo Largo, our luggage was lost after a direct flight from Toronto to Cayo Largo. A fiasco was about to start, nobody could help us locate our luggage, nobody knew how to contact Toronto to see if our luggage was sent on the plane, nobody understood what we were trying to ask. After the Cubana Hola Sun representative finally understood that we did not receive our luggage, and had an airport rep scribble on a piece of paper of apparently what seemed to be a lost luggage report. The Hola Sun rep insisted we get on a bus to our hotel, when we wanted to receive answers before leaving the airport on the status of where our luggage was located and how we can have access to it. Nobody wanted to make a call to Toronto. They indicated the only flight from Toronto to Cayo Largo was the 5th of August, the day we were leaving Cayo Largo, and we had no other options in regards to receiving our luggage. We left the airport after the Hola Sun rep told us she would take care of this. The next morning at our group meeting with the same Hola Sun Cubana rep, she did not recognize us and did not know we had lost our luggage. She scribbled beside our room number lost luggage. She told us again that she had no way of contacting Toronto to see where our luggage was and that she had no control in this matter. The following day we approached the rep yet again about our lost luggage and that we had nothing for the entire week in the deserted island of Cayo Largo, she said we should contact the Cubana rep at the Cayo Largo that only works after 1PM. She again did not want to call Toronto Cubana Airline for us to see if the luggage was there or not. The next day, she had no idea who we were and said she did not deal with lost luggage. Finally, day 4 of our trip, still no baggage, no sunscreen, no clothes, no snorkelling kits, no shoes, a new rep comes on duty and immediately takes charge and types a Microsoft Word document stating we lost our luggage and signs it, still no report sent to YYZ stating they lost our luggage. She then tells us she spoke to the Cayo Largo Airport rep of Cubana that will send our luggage to Cayo Largo tomorrow via Varadero. The next morning, we prepare to be ready for the arrival of the 6.45AM plane from Varadero, to finally receive our luggage. Nothing, nobody knows, no claims about lost luggage, no reports, no file #. Day 6, we go see the rep again, who states your luggage could have never sent because YYZ Cubana is on strike, sorry. Day 7, finally we leave this fiasco, on route to YYZ to see about where could our luggage be. We arrive in YYZ at 1AM, no reports about lost luggage, nobody at Baggage Claim knows what we are talking about, Cubana. He brings us into a closet, hundreds of lost luggage unorganized piled on top of each other, a dozen of strollers, bugs, humidity smell, and he says to check in there by ourselves. Desperate, we search through the piled on top of each other, nothing. The Baggage Claim in YYZ tells us to call in the morning, nobody knows and there's no claim report in their system and they refuse to file an official report for us in the system, stating only this one person can do the actual report. 2AM we drive 5 hours home hoping maybe the luggage was sent home during our time away. Nothing. 5 days of phone calls, we find the luggage.

### "horrible, unprofessional airline "
Havana to Mexico City. Cubana Airlines is the most horrible, unprofessional airline I've seen in my life! We had booked a flight from Cuba to Mexico City on 23rd July at 6am,  to then catch our international flight from Mexico City at 1pm. (5 hours stop, which gives enough time for any anticipated delays from Cuba) Its 6:30am and still we didn't board and no feedback when we will take off, then at 7am they announce boarding. We stood in line and there was no employee to board us and we could see that the plane had no captain or any employee inside. 20 min later an employee shouts in the airport in Spanish "gate change". We board the plane after 1.30 hours delay to find the plane so dirty and smelling. After 1 hour of flight, the captain announces there's a problem with the wing ne and we have to go back to Havana airport! We flew back to Havana, were dropped at the airport with no information on what's next and were led like sheep back into passport control. That was already 10am and obviously we had missed our international flight from Mexico to Beirut since no other plane was scheduled to depart and the flight takes 2:30hrs to Mexico city. We tried to find someone to talk to, the security guy didn't speak any English so we got the translation from another passenger, and we understood that they don't know what will happen next. We tried to look/ask for the manager and they told us he is very busy and has no time for us! We asked for him urgently because our international flight is gone and obviously we had paid a lot of money for the flight, but the employee of Cubana Airlines didn't seem to care much and told us "its not my problem" Our luggage's were given back to us and still no information on anything else Our adventure of chasing the manager lasted for 3 hours with all the excuses you can imagine "he's up in his office", "he's down somewhere", "he's very busy", "he's not answering his phone". etc.. One of the times when we were told he's in his office, we went and obviously he wasn't there, another employee of Cubana airlines was there and when we told her what's the issue, she simply stood up, left the office, locked it behind her and ignored us. After 3 hours running from one place to the other at the airport carrying all our luggage with us up and down the stairs not less than 10 times, we found at last the famous manager. My husband explained to him the situation, however his reply wasn't any better than his employees, he also advised that its not his problem. When my husband asked him at least if he will provide a plane anytime soon, his answer was "now go to the hotel and I don't have any information on when we will have another plane! Not only did the manager have the worst communication skills, he didn't even bother to suggest a solution. Now we went looking for a flight that goes back to our home country which is impossible in a country like Cuba with no internet, no wifi, no sms, airline offices with no employees and few/no people speaking English. We ended up paying 4500USD for 2 tickets one way back home!

### "not friendly, poor service, old planes"
Toronto to Cayo Largo return. Was hesitant to book with Cubana after reading reviews, wish I followed my instincts. Flight to Cayo Largo was actually ok. Flight home a nightmare. Were told it was delayed 30 minutes, got to the airport, boarded, was excited for the first time in 3 trips my trip home wasn't going to be delayed hours! Then everything went wrong. When they turned the jets on, a strong strong smell came into the plane of jet fuel. People coughing, sneezing, we were covering our mouths. 20 minutes later the captain says they have an error in the cockpit and we must disembark. 30 minutes later we get off the plane, and play a waiting game, overhearing on the intercom 'your estimated departure time is approximately tomorrow. At 10:30 our rep says at 11:30 if the plane isn't fixed they will have to figure out what they are doing with us. 11:30 its fixed they say, but can't land at Pearson now?? So back to the resorts we go. But only after we have to get our visas back one by one, and our luggage, and check back in, only to have to check out at 7 am to return to the airport. They attempted to feed us the meals from the plane when we left the airport, it was a soggy piece of bread and some soggy cucumbers. Unedible. We saw them giving water to some people, we didn't get any. Which by the time we landed the next day put us at 25 hours without a meal or beverage. The bus came and we waited until 10:20 to board the plane, many of us didn't want to get back on as we were scared. It wasn't a good situation, and they should have sent a new plane, but I know it's a risk flying with Cubana. So 10:45 we finally fire up, and the plane smells again, we were all nervous, I've never smelt jet fuel on the plane like that, it was terrible. We managed to take off regardless, and I cried on the way home. So much turbulence, the entire flight, and the landing was so rough. It was the first time I was almost sick on an airplane, good thing I wasn't as there wasn't even a vomit bag. Another part is no communication. The captain never came over to tell us anything, I missed communication greatly. Sometimes he would just say something in Spanish which was more alarming. Many of us concurred they are our never again airline. They should be taken out of commission, not safe, not friendly, poor service, old planes. Just happy to be alive! Do yourself a favour, if you are debating on booking with Cubana like I was, don't!! !

### "service has deteriorated even further"
Since the last published review it seems that the service has deteriorated even further. Our flight from Havana to Santiago which was scheduled for 13.00 was cancelled at the last minute and we were told to come back in the morning! After seven hours in the airport and some vociferous complaining we eventually got on the last flight out that night. Our return trip three days later was scheduled for 8.25am but when I checked with the Cubana office in Santiago the day before I was told it had been delayed, by 12 hours. All the staff in the airports and on the planes were surly, uncommunicative and downright unhelpful. As with a lot of the state run services in Cuba, the state employees have got jobs for life and just don't care. If I had thought to look at these reviews before booking the holiday, I would have stayed well clear of internal flights and I would recommend this course of action to anyone considering it.

### "I will never fly Cubana again"
Toronto to Cayo Coco. When boarding in Toronto staff at gate were initially very nice and friendly. Once on board what a disappointment. Staff were very stoic, looked unhappy, seemed annoyed when they came around with beverages and you actually wanted to buy one. I purchase a cola and was short changed $4.00. When I politely mentioned it to the stewardess she rolled her eyes, said something in Spanish to her coworker who then laughed and then abruptly gave me $4.00. The plane was very dated and dirty, seats were crammed and sink flooded in washroom. No smiles from anyone working on the plane. Flight home was worse. We were suppose to fly out on a Sunday evening at 8pm, were notified by hotel that flight changed to 2am! Not a problem cause we were able to stay in the room at no charge. We then get a call flight is delayed to 330am, now annoyed. We finally get to airport to another delay, flight to depart 440 - no explanation, no one has an answer or cares to help. Finally board the flight home, plane was a bit better than first one or maybe because we lucked out and got seats in row 3 that had extra leg room. Again, attendants were cold faced, shoved a paper in your hand as you got on plane and did not smile or say hi. Again they came around with food and beverages and just plopped food in front of you and said nothing. I sat next to a woman who had crutches from an injury she got on vacation, she asked to use the washroom up in the front as it was 2 rows away, attendant refused to let her insisting that only first class paying people use it. They made her hobble to the very back of the plane. When we finally landed they opened the door and stood there looking miserable, not one staff member smiled or said a word. What a miserable group of people. I will never fly Cubana again.

### "never had such a bad experience"
Havana to Managua. The worst airline I have ever had misfortune to fly with. Initially I was booked to fly to San Jose from Havana on the 19th April but this flight was cancelled when I arrived at the airport. After being taken to a hotel back in Havana that was the last we heard from the airline - people had to make their own way to the Cubana office to sort out new flights. I opted to go to Managua on the 22nd as that was my eventual destination and would save a long bus journey - big mistake! Confusing communication about my pick up from my hotel meant I was taken to the airport 8 hours before my flight. I tried to get food vouchers but got nowhere with the staff - even trying to sort out food myself was impossible with the lack of facilities at Jose Marti. The time to board came and went - no one thought to come and let us know what was happening, eventually 3 hours after we were supposed to depart the flight was cancelled with the excuse that it was the weather - interestingly no other airline seemed to be affected by this phenomenon, even another Cubana flight seemed to be still leaving. It then took a further 2 and a half hours to sort out transport to a hotel back in the city. We did eventually leave on the 23rd but even that wasn't without hold ups and lack of information. I know sometimes things happen that are outside your control but the one thing that marked this experience was that no one from Cubana ever said the words "I'm sorry". Waiting for the bus after the cancelled Managua flight - staff would not look us in the eye when we asked for someone to come and sort out the situation - just told "another 20 minutes go wait there". A lot of the frustration felt by the passengers on both flights could have been avoided if we had been given information on what was happening and treated as human beings rather than an inconvenience that needed to be passed on elsewhere. I've flown on a lot of iffy airlines in the past but have never had such a bad experience as I had with this joke of an airline. Never again!

### "nightmare experience"
Flew Cubana Airlines from Santiago De Cuba to Havana. Awful. Flight delayed by 7 hours - no one at the airport knew what was going on, we kept being given different times. Flight was full of people from the night before whose flight was cancelled. No compensation given - missed our flights home so had to buy new ones at a cost of 1400USD each. Would not recommend - just take the bus its cheaper and far more reliable. Nightmare experience.

### "Staff was very rude"
Toronto to Cayo Coco return. We returned from Cuba to Toronto on February 19 leaving 11:35 from Cuba. Staff was very rude, it seems like they didn't care. We asked for tea and they brought the tea - we then asked for milk and sugar and she even didn't acknowledge this, not even the second time.

### "I would not recommend"
Santiago de Cuba to Havana. The representatives are very unhelpful and would not recommend to use this airline. We had a delay from Santiago (due to faults in the aeroplane) and they did not have any information about how long it would take. We had another flight from Havana 3 hours later but we were not given any priority or help. The Cubana Airlines representative did not even want to tell us the name of the hotel where the other customers were spending the night until the aeroplane was fixed. In the end the delay lasted 18 hours and we lost all our flights back home. The airline did nothing to compensate for the flights lost and we had to buy new tickets to get back. To top it all, when we finally arrived in Havana, we spent 1 whole hour on the plane waiting for the plane stairs and a bus to take us to the arrivals. Horrible experience so make sure you have extra days to cater for any delays if booking with this airline!

### "worst airline I have flown with"
Toronto to Cayo Coco. Cubana Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown with. My 6am flight meant I was ready to check in at 3am, only to find the flight was now delayed by 6 hours to noon, and then at 9.30 delayed again to 14.30. What a complete joke and $15 for snacks is supposed to be compensation? Come on Cubana Airlines, this is ridiculous!

### "seats were really really tight"
Toronto to Cayo Coco via Cienfuegos. Left from Pearson International Airport on August 14,2016. Flight to Cayo Coco was supposed to leave at 6:25 am, being I read the reviews of the airline prior to booking I thought, ok great one of the first flights out so it shouldn't be delayed. Wrong, checked the time around 10 the night before to discover it was delayed until 9:00 am. Plane was older but fine with me other than the seats were really really tight, I thought Sunwing was bad but Cubana is much worse. No tv's but again, I don't watch them so that didn't matter. Crew was nice, breakfast snack was good. Coming home, I checked the night before to ensure the flight was on time, it was. I checked again in the morning and the hotel assured me that if it was delayed the Rep would have notified the hotel. Flight was leaving at 12:35 pm. We arrived at the airport at approx 11:30 am to find the flight delayed to 1:00 then 1:30 then 4:00 then 4:30 then we finally left at 5:00. Would I fly Cubana again? Depends on the difference in price between Cubana and the next airline. If it's not a huge difference in price I would book the next airline to avoid the delays, if cost doesn't matter, then go with the other airline to lessen the chance of delays and a little more legroom. I booked first class coming home. It was so worth the extra 100 pesos ($120 cdn) for the extra large seats and almost 3 feet of legroom, better service, a care package and much better meal then economy.

### "the most decrepit plane"
Montreal to Cayo Coco. This was the worst flight/company I have ever dealt with. On April 29th at 3:45am I get to the Montreal airport where I am to board the 7am flight to Cuba, Cayo Coco. Upon my arrival, I am told that the flight has been delayed to 9:50pm - when I left my house at 3:00am, the flight was still on for 7:00am. They told us that they were giving our plane to the flight for Cayo Largo that was supposed to leave the day before. All in all, we waited in Montreal airport for 19 hours. After a lot of arguing, Cubana Airlines hired Sunwing to take us to Cayo Coco. We had to wait in the plane from 11pm to 12h 30am because Cubana Airlines had to give a document to them. Finally arrived to destination/hotel at 5:30am the next day. On our way back, Cubana was on time, no issues there. The issues however came up with the plane itself. It was the most decrepit plane I have ever seen and flown. I get to my seat, get my bagages settled, only to find that I can not actually sit in my seat without have the back of the seat lay down on the passengers lap that was sitting behind me. With a a lot arguing with the stewardess, they finally changed my seat (they actually wanted me to sit there the whole time without resting my back). Get myself settled again, to only have someone comme up to me and tell me that this was their seat. This happened to me 3 other times - I finally get a seat that no one claims, but the plane was dirty. This plane looked like it had not been cleaned since its inauguration, it was just downright dirty. You get what you pay for, but seriously, this was beyond that. Never, ever again will I fly Cubana Airlines.

### "11 hours of delay"
Montreal to Santa Clara with Cubana Airlines. 11 hours of delay from Montreal to Cuba, 7 hours of delay from Cuba to Montreal. Worst experience ever, not just because of the delay, but the flight turned out to be night flight because of the delay - but all the lights in the cabin were on for the total duration of the flight. I was travelling with my boyfriend, at first we were seated next to each other but it turn out that in both cases they assigned more than one person to the same seat.

### "scramble for seats"
CU977 from Holguín to Havana scheduled for check in at 2100, flight at 2300 on Sunday 17 April 2016. Taxi was early so we arrived to check in about 19:20. At 2100 uproar as about 120 passengers advised that the flight was delayed. About 2230 advised that plane would not be arriving but two other smaller planes would be sent. Allowed to check in then sent to sit in freezing cold departure lounge (in middle of Cuban heatwave) - aircon thermostats set at 16 deg and no amount of requests to staff would persuade them that the thermostats could be comfortably raised to about 21deg. At about 0230 on 18th April a lonely Aerocarribean ATR 42 arrived and there was a mad undisciplined scramble for seats. The one in front of me was broken and the seat back was down onto my leg. I have a bad knee - not good. The very tired looking Stewardess was helpful and swapped our seats with a mother and short legged child, safety apparently was not a priority - the seat had obviously been broken a long time as were several others! Eventually got to Havana where we waited for luggage. Our booked taxi had long gone home! One good note, the landing in the dark at Jose Marti Havana was superb, hardly felt contact with the runway. Big thanks to pilot for safe uneventful flight in a smelly and poorly maintained cabin.

### "service even more basic"
Departure from Toronto March 31st started off with the check in desks not being ready when I arrived, but they set up a little later. Didn't appear to be any issues with the departure time of 12.50. Flight ok, service ok, basic, notice no movie screens, no ear phones issued, no pillows or blankets provided. Flight went smoothly and arrived at SCU on time. Return was another story entirely. I've noted from other reviews that Cubana appears to have developed a steady pattern, which may now be a practice, of not being on time, major delays, and very poor to no information being communicated to passengers. Yes, airlines experience delays and equipment problems. But in this day and age what continues to happen with both of these companies is not acceptable. So, for the return. The 6.05 departure on April 7th from SCU was originally on time, but then it was delayed. No explanation as to why. At approx. 7.30 or 8 an official came into the departure lounge and passengers went to speak with him to find out what was going on. We were told the flight wouldn't be leaving until 3 am. We asked about being taken out of the airport and accommodated for more comfort etc. due to the length of the wait and were told no. We asked about food and refreshments and were told that was being organized. The timing of the departure changed 3 more times after that, moving to 10pm and 11pm that night, and then finally an empty jet arrived at 12.20. Rumour had it that there was a problem with the flight coming down from Toronto and it had to turn back. Same thing with a flight that was allegedly coming from Havana. We were also told that they had to get permissions in place for our plane to land at Toronto in the wee hours of the morning (eg: 2.30am). Once the empty jet landed and we loaded, we took off at 1.30 am. Service even more basic than the flight coming down - drinks and a snack were served but nothing else. No duty free offered. And, again, no earphones, no movie screens, no pillows or blankets. We flew without any incident, landing in Toronto at 5.30 am. A lot of passengers had to miss work / school that day because of the toll all of that drama took. Again, by this point in time Cubana and Hola Sun seriously need to pull up their socks and change their ideas and approach towards their schedules and their approach, especially with regard to providing better communications and information, to the travelling public. There are limited airlines that fly into Santiago. But that doesn't mean Cubana has any sort of monopoly and can treat passengers like that.

### "never again with Cubana"
Montreal to Havana with Cubana Airlines. My husband and I arrive 3 hours earlier to give our tickets and to be place for seats on the flight. We were there first in line for an hour at least. It took so much time to get our seats on the flight that we were the last ones to have our seats for the travel and were seated at the very back of the flight. To go to Havana our flight was reported late for 3 hours. The day we came back we arrive 3 hours earlier again at the Havana airport. When it was time to register the guy couldn't find our name on the flight. They made us wait in front of the booth and I had to sit on my suitcase for 2:30hrs. All that to have a confirmation half an hour before our flight left. No one said sorry for the confusion. Never again will I go with Cubana.

### "a horrible experience"
Toronto to Cayo Coco. I will never fly with Cubana Airlines again, because of them our trip was cut short by one day, we were supposed to be in Cayo Coco at 10:00 am on April 10th but because the flight was cancelled we didn't get there until 4 am on April 11th. When we got to the airport we had no idea the flight was cancelled until an hour after boarding was supposed to start, they told us the flight didn't show up, then we were told there was no crew members available and the third and final excuse was that 3 birds flew into the aircraft causing the cancellation, we all had to either go home or stay at the hotel since the flight was supposed to leave the next day at 6 am, we were about to leave the hotel to go shopping when we found out that the flight was actually going to leave the same night, thanks for letting us know if it weren't for the people that were notified by trip advisor we would have missed the flight. We were all given vouchers for breakfast lunch and dinner guess what we had to pay an extra $70 to eat at the hotel it was ridiculous. Once we finally got on the airplane the seats were dirty and the crew members pretty rude. Overall a horrible experience!

### "wouldn't recommend Cubana Airlines"
Flew from Varadero to Toronto April 8, 2016. Flight was scheduled for 8:40 PM, but flight was delayed for no reason to 10:50 PM. Then it was delayed to 11:50 PM. Did not actually board until midnight and plane actually took off April 9 at 12:20 AM. Cubana didn't offer any reasons for delay. They offered us all a snack at 10:30 PM to appease our anger. This was my fourth flight with Cubana and 3 of those flights were delayed by 2 or more hrs. They don't seem to try to keep any of their timings. Totally unprofessional. I wouldn't recommend Cubana Airlines. Maybe a lot cheaper than flying with someone else but you get what you pay for.

### "never recommend flying Cubana"
Toronto to Santiago Cuba with Cubana Airlines. 12:50pm scheduled departure. At 1:15pm was told there was a delay to 2:00pm – boarded plane 2:30pm – was told there was a flat tire and were asked to exit plane. At 4:30pm was told that the flat tire was fixed but the crew could no longer fly because their hours had expired and the plane would be delayed until 6:30am Friday April 8, 2016 5:00pm – was told to return all duty free products for a refund and that all luggage would be unloaded 5:15pm – told we would be given taxi and hotel vouchers but most hotels were full 6:00pm – told to pick up luggage and would have to return tomorrow and get new boarding passes and go through security again by 3:00am Friday April 8, 2016. 6:00pm to 8:00pm no Cubana staff could be found and no luggage was being unloaded and no information provided. 8:30pm we finally received luggage and would have to go wait in a line to see if hotel rooms were located. No Hola Sun Rep could be located throughout this ordeal. No offer of compensation was communicated. Checked departures on Friday April 8, 2016 and found the flight finally took off at 7:30am however because the flight between Toronto and Holguin uses the same plane their flight is now delayed 12 hours until Friday April 8, 2016 at 6pm. In my opinion Toronto Pearson Airport should ban Cubana Airlines from flying in and out. Any other airline would have another plane pick up travellers to complete the trip but this is not an option with Cubana Airlines. Would never recommend flying with Cubana Airlines unless you’re willing to put up with what was explained above.

### "don't think about flying Cubana"
We arrived in Cancun on UA, and were scheduled to fly to Havana on Cubana. The flight was delayed 2 hours, then 13 hours, and then it was cancelled with no explanation. Someone finally came to talk to everyone, and told us that because it was Spring break in Cancun, there were no hotels, but we were welcome to sleep in the airport. Seriously! People were so angry that the police had to come stand watch. After the cancellation, they literally held our luggage hostage for 6 hours, and wouldn't give it back to us. They told us Mexican Customs didn't have time to inspect it and give it back. 6 hours! Being Spring break, the only room I could find was at the Ritz Cartlon for $800/night. Beautiful, but not in the budget. They only had a room for one night, so we had to switch to another hotel the next night. After three days, we decided to purchase new flights on Aeromexico. We also had to book a new place to stay in Havana, because we were now three days late, and our room was gone. The entire debacle cost us about 6K (4 travellers.) Aeromexico was flawless and the planes were really nice. I don't know why our agent steered us toward Cubana - but that's another story I'm trying to deal with. Don't even think about flying Cubana.

### "worst travel experience ever"
Worst travel experience ever with Cubana Airlines . Our 7:00am flight from Havana to Mexico City was cancelled at the last minute. After a 4 hour wait we were bused to an absolute dump of a hotel. At 8pm we were bused back to the airport where we waited for 3 hours before we were finally checked in, went through security and waited at the gate. At 3:00am we were told we were not going to fly and had to go back to the hotel. After another delay we got our luggage back and were bused back to a different (but at least better hotel). Now it is 5:00am the next day. At 8:00pm (now 37 hours after the original departure time) we were bused back to the airport. We checked in and this time we actually boarded the plane and took off around 11:00pm, 40 hours after the original departure time. Once we landed my travel partner and 3 other customers were missing their luggage. During the delay we were provided one meal each day and one bottle of water at one of the hotels (that's it, no kidding). Never again will I fly Cubana Airlines.

### "they just cancel willy-nilly"
Basically, don't fly within Cuba with Cubana Airlines. You may never get there. I don't think Cubana Airlines has enough planes to fulfill their daily scheduled flights, so they just cancel willy-nilly. It took 25 hours to get from Baracoa to Havana. The airport staff gave little or no information, and eventually just lied about the flight. After waiting seven hours, we learned the flight had been cancelled, and we would be transferred by bus to Santago de Cuba. We waited another three hours, took a five hour non-stop bus ride, and waited an additional five hours for a flight. We were put at the tail end of a flight from Madrid, which was continuing to Havana. Once at Havana, we waited over an hour to de-plane. There was one bus, which had to shuttle back and forth from plane to terminal. Waited another hour for the luggage.

### "never book with them again"
This is the first time we booked with Cubana Airlines, from Toronto to Varadero. It started with we were suppose to depart on time but the flight crew didn't get there until 6:05 am. The food was horrible, crew aren't very friendly. When we arrived we got through customs, waiting for our luggage didn't take long but when we got our daughters suitcase the one wheel was broken off. Our flight back was horrible, they gave out like a 3rd piece of bread with nothing on it? When I went to use the bathroom the crew were sleeping in the back? We will never book with them again, they don't show a movie which if you have kids and are prepared for no movies shown, its a long flight. The only positive thing was you get more luggage.

### "ground staff dismissive"
Once on the plane, Cubana Airlines is no better or worse than any other low cost airline. The issue arises, as noted in several reviews, in getting on the plane. Flights are subject to very short notice delays and cancellations, the ground staff are at best dismissive, at worst outright rude and are more interested in chatting with their friends than serving customers. Booking tickets is a nightmare (the office in Santiago closes when they feel like it, the website crashes if you try to use the english version) however you can bribe the ground crew at the airport to get on a flight, tickets sold to non-Cubans seem to cost twice as much as those sold to Cubans. Overall, were there other options for internal flights in Cuba I would not use this airline again however Cubana Airlines seem to have a virtual monopoly, leaving us with no option but to suck up the poor service. This is a shame as the rest of Cuba is populated by the most friendly people who are always happy to help where they can, this airline really let the side down.

### "a 9 hour delay"
Cucuta (Colombia) to Havana with Cubana Airlines. On our outbound flight there was a 4 hour delay, and then every half hour the flight was pushed back another 1/2 hour until after a 9 hour delay we were loaded onto the flight. The plane had not been cleaned in a long time. On return flight we arrived checked-in and went to the gate - no customer service agents were present. At our scheduled departure time, no gate agents present. One hour after our scheduled departure time no agent present, and so on - finally a short announcement on the PA told us to wait in an un airconditioned cafeteria - we did for more than an hour. Finally, seven hours after our scheduled departure we were boarded on a chartered non-Cubana air plane.

### "flight was delayed 24 hours"
We booked a Cubana Airlines domestic flight from Baracoa to Havana. The morning we arrived at the airport, a lady came to tell us the flight was delayed 24 hours. No more explanation, no other options, no accomodation to stay. Next we arrive again at the airport with the other passangers. They check us in and after check-in they anounce the flight is canceled again for that day. But we are advised to wait as the airplane might still arrive. From the local Cubans waiting with us, we hear the airplane has been broken for 3 days already and waiting for repair in Haiti. There was no communucation from the Cubana Airlines staff about alternatives to get to Havana whatsoever. They just kept us waiting again. All the tourist passengers decided together to go away and find an alternative ourselves. Several of us already missed our conncecting flights back home, which are not refunded by cubana.

### "I would recommend Cubana"
I've travelled a couple times on Cubana Airlines because they offer a good price as part of an all inclusive package. Check in at Montreal and Varadero airports was fine with not a lot of waiting. I got the emergency rows for both flights, as requested however the check in agent in Varadero airport gave me the wrong boarding pass. Fortunatly I realize it before I went throught customs and security and he gave me the right one. The aircraft was an A320 leased from Avion Express. The cabin was fine but not the most recent. Some announcements onboard were made in French. The crew and the service was fine. Cubana is probably the only airline that offers a meal free of charge on Canadian destinations. There's no inflight entertainment. The inbound flight was continuing to Havana and despite the announcements in 3 different languages saying that passengers travelling to Havana have to stay on board some Cuban travellers were confused. I would recommend Cubana and every time I travelled with this airline I didn't have any problems.

### "cabin service was friendly"
This was my first flight with Cubana Airlines and wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised at the flight and service. The plane to Holguin was a bit dirty and dated, but left a bit early and the leg and elbow room was great. Coming home we left about an hour late and never found out why. This plane seemed newer and cleaner. Both ways the cabin service was friendly and attentive. While other airlines are cutting service and staff, Cubana Airlines seemed like the old days. A nice lunch was served and very good coffee. Also we were allowed 2 checked bags of up to 50lbs each and a 20lb carry on. The package price we got was a steal. I will fly Cubana Airlines again

### "would fly Cubana again"
This was not a Cubana Airlines plane, but a leased aircraft from Avion Express. Sat in business class in a 2-2 configuration, 8 seats in all. Tons of leg room. The meal was upgraded from the one served in economy. No TV or audio. Luggage allowance was 3 bags at 23kg/bag. Flight down left early. Home was 50 min late. I would fly Cubana again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
I was pleasantly surprised as this was the first time I traveled with Cubana Airlines. The plane was modern and nice, service friendly and excellent. Meal on board was amazing compare to Sunwing and Air Transat. Flights was very smooth in particular the landings. I give Cubana Airlines at least an 8 out of 10.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
On the way to Cuba, the wait time was two hours for check-in. Baggage took an hour to arrive as well. On my return flight, I showed up 3 hours early as recommended for my 6am flight. We stood waiting until 5am when they told us the plane was delayed until 9pm. I had a flight at 8pm that night and asked for a refund. So many things went wrong with this flight but the customer service or lack of was ridiculous. I arrived to Mexico city at midnight and ended up having to purchase another ticket out of pocket for the flight I missed.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We booked this flight because it was the only direct flight from Cancun to Havana, the flight should take about 1 hour. When we arrived at the airport the staff at the incheck-counter said we would have an delay of 5 hours because they overbooked the airplane and they need to fly in an other plane from Cuba (via Mexico City). Finally we departed 7.5 hours later, the only service they provided was a food voucher of 10$. So for us, never again!

### Cubana Airlines customer review
I flew CUN-HAV-CUN with Cubana in November 2014. Inbound flight was delayed for 3 hours due to bad weather in the region. Service was average and no entertainment onboard but it is a 1 hr 20 minutes flight so I did some reading. Outbound flight was on time. Good value for money but do not expect nothing fancy.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We flew from Toronto to Cayo Coco and everything went as it should have. On time both directions decent food and great cabin crew. Lots of legroom but the plane could have used a good cleaning. I would fly with them again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
I traveled from Montreal to Cayo Coco last week and was relieved to find that I did not experience all the negative experiences that have previously been reported. Outbound and inbound flights were right on time. No charge for checked bags was bonus and lunch provided was adequate. Would definitely fly Air Cubana again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Tried to fly from Cancun to Havana on 28th February. Arrived at check-in at 14.00 for a 16.00 flight. Waited and waited and finally checked in at 16.15 15 minutes after the flight was due to leave! They issued boarding cards and then said they didn't know where the plane was! They then told us we wouldn't be flying - this is a 1 hour 20 minute flight. After waiting an hour we were told we would be going to a hotel - a hotel it wasn't! Disgusting student accommodation which they took us in mini buses which for 200 passengers took 20 journeys over 5 hours! No Cubana representative at the hotel or the next morning. In the end we had to make our own plans and flew with Copa via Panama. Unfortunately Cubana works on Cuban lines which means if it goes wrong nothing to do with us. They maybe cheap but it will cost you a lot more in the end.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We paid for 4 seats. When we boarded they took our tickets and then he left with our tickets. I had 3 children with me 12 4 and a 2 year old. We were put at the very back where the seats don't recline. They took one of my seats and gave it to someone else. I had to sit straight up for 4 hours with a squirming 2 year old on my lap. I had to ask 4 times for a couple of blankets for the kids and even then they gave them to the people in front of us. Cubana airlines are almost as bad as Air France. Regardless we won't be flying either.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
My wife daughter and myself flew with Cubana to Cayo Largo the last week of Feb 2015. On both trips to and from the plane was pretty much on time well prepared staff were friendly enough and conducted themselves in a professional manner. Considering what we paid for our holiday we were surprised that we got a meal on both flights and it was quite enjoyable. Not the best airline in the world by any means but the flight was smooth. I have nothing negative to say about Cubana at all and as far as their planes the ones used for trips from Ontario to Cuba during the winter months are an Avion wet lease which are in partnership with Thompson so no worries as to who maintains and looks after the fleet of planes. If you decide to take Cubana you can also get good deals we got great savings with a "half off" tax sale they had.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We flew from Montreal to Havana on the 22 February 2015 and back on the 27 and everything ran smoothly on both flights. The plane was on time and the personnel onboard were ok. The plane and the toilets were clean. It is the third year in a row that I have flown with Cubana and I have nothing to complain about. Great value for the money. It is basic transportation but for a 4 hour flight we don't need more. If you want a newer airplane and more services take another airline and pay much more.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
On Sunday February 7th 2015 my wife and I were on Cubana Flight 188 returning to Toronto from Holguin. On approach to Pearson Airport in Toronto the pilot was advised that the airport was closed and we were diverted to Montreal. All passengers behaved extremely well and took everything in stride. However once in Montreal it took over 2 hours before our luggage was made available and only after that coupons for meals and accommodation were handed out. We finally got to our hotel at 11.00 pm and had to be back at the airport at 5.00 am. The wickets were finally manned at 6.00am. All the delays were totally unnecessary and the whole procedure could have been handled in a far more expeditious and speedy manner. I repeat kudos to all passengers who despite the long waits and line ups were extremely patient.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
CU187 on Jan 17 and CU186 on Jan 24. I was very impressed with Cubana Airlines. We flew out from Toronto to Caya Coco. The plane was clean and had more leg room than any other airline I have used lately. There was no entertainment but I can entertain myself for a few hours. I had heard there would be no meal but was pleasantly surprised when I got a nice fresh bun ham cheese and tomato desert and juice. Frankly I didn't miss the constant interruptions by staff to sell me stuff. I found the staff at the airport and on the flight friendly and helpful. I would gladly book them for my next holiday.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
If your hoping to get away on holiday within an uplifting environment don't look here. Staff are extremely miserable. I realized from take-off that there were issues. They actually brought their own people to unload the plane in Toronto from Cuba who got to sit in first class and the only ones allowed to use the main washroom. The queues were huge for the rear washroom. Stewards were always miserable and argumentative. When we reached Toronto there was no luggage for over an hour and a half. No one from Cubana Airlines to be found to give information about the huge delay and lack of service. The plane landed at 10.45 pm and the luggage was nowhere to be found even at midnight. Staff hung-up on me 3 times during our conversation because they wanted a fee to deliver the bag they delayed. Since I was on crutches it was necessary to leave and no sitting apparatus was provided around the luggage ramp. They said on take off that a wheelchair would be waiting when we took off from Cuba. None was to be seen in Toronto.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
The planes are old dirty and poorly maintained. Staff are very unfriendly never even said hello or goodbye both times I flew with them (Toronot-Varadero-Toronto). The back of my seat was broken. There was about a 1.5 hr delay each way with no announcements or explanations. Zero entertainment. The only positive was that they did serve the food - although it was pretty awful continental breakfast variety.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Santiago de Cuba-Havana in an IL96. We arrived very early at the airport as recommended and the check-in was quick and efficient but not very friendly. The flight was a domestic continuation of a flight from Paris and operated on time. The seats on board had adequate legroom but a hard bar across the lower back made them rather uncomfortable. While the boarding passes had allocated seats in fact passengers could sit anywhere except in the front area which was for the international passengers (some young men not in uniform seemed to be security staff enforcing non-mixing of international and domestic passengers). For most of the flight the cabin lights were totally extinguished (it was an evening flight) and the personal reading lights didn't work. The cabin crew disappeared while the plane was in flight. No refreshments were served. On arrival the plane docked at the international terminal where as ensured by the security staff the passengers from Paris disembarked via an air bridge while we were bussed a long way to the domestic terminal and waited a long time for our luggage. Overall Cubana is an effective and interesting way to get from A to B but don't expect any frills. By the way our booking through an international booking engine worked fine.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Flew YUL-CCC-YUL. Flight was 2 hours late no announcement made at check in or gate we only found out about the delay by looking at the airport screens. Plane is a bus with wings an old A320 leased from avion express no TV no magazines only reading material was the safety card no air sickness bag. Poor service on board pressed the call button but no flight attendant came by (needed water for medicine). For the bar service the flight attendant ran down the aisle I didn't see them serve one alcoholic drink (need to pay) to anyone and finished the plane in 5 mins. The seat pitch is quite small and I'm 6'1 and was touching the seat in front of me. With no entertainment makes it a very long flight! Wont be flying Cubana again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
The flight to and from Havana was fine. I felt safe even though it was an older plane. I felt that it would add to my Cuban experience to use their national airline. My biggest frustration was that both flights were quite late.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
YUL-HOG-YUL Tropical class outbound Economy class return with an Airbus A320 lease from Avion Express on both legs. I chose Cubana airlines because it was a good price. All flights went smoothly despite a little delay on the return flight. Check in by my fellow colleagues in Montreal went smoothly same thing was also in Holguin. I got an upgrade in Tropical class on my outbound flight which I found it was the same service in Economy class but the only difference was the meal and the seat. There was no entertainment during these 4 hours flights. The flight attendants were not very smiley and didn't interact that much with passengers however they do take their jobs seriously. Cubana airlines is not the best airline but it's pretty fine and it has improved in the past 15 years. I would travel again with this them.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Would you consider 22 hours of delay time acceptable? - 10 hour delay leaving Toronto and 12 hour delay leaving Cuba. Sleeping in Varadero Airport for 12 hours - staff were uncommunicative - no hello nor goodbye - did you enjoy the flight - absolutely nothing - no apology from the pilot. All other flights left both Toronto and Cuba with only an hour or two delay. We will never use Cubana Airlines again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Havana to Cancun economy class. Arrived at the airport to find the flight had been delayed by 1.5 hours. It took almost 2 hours to check in clear immigration and go through security - airport is a bit chaotic. There was another hour delay which was not explained to us at all. Once on board the flight experience was actually not too bad - flight attendants were professional and served us complimentary snacks and drinks. The aircraft was a new Tupolev 204-100E.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
My daughter and I flew to Holguin on May 8th. Everything was fine both ways except we didn't care for the food. There was no inflight entertainment but I always choose to read anyway. On the return we each had 3 seats to ourselves so we could sleep comfortably. Would definitely fly Cubana again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Aircraft going to Cuba was a little worn but the overall flight and service were quite acceptable. Coming home the aircraft was more updated and again quite acceptable. Both flights were smooth as were take offs and landings. No inflight entertainment so if you are travelling with young children bring along a play kit. Also there is no inflight duty free shopping.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
LGW to Havana via Holquin. Flight 2 hrs late. Plane was good staff ok food good and plenty of leg room. The only downside was the entertainment it was awful - mostly re-runs and on the return 2 weeks later they showed exactly the same. For a 12 hr flight very poor. On return plane sat on runway for 40 mins but landed at LGW on time! Couldn't hear or understand any messages over tannoy system. Toilets clean and tidy. On return at Havana they tried to charge us for overweight cases even though they were both well under the 30kilos allowance. Overall Cubana Airlines were very good and we would travel them again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
I flew out to Havana on 15th March. Delayed because of fog. Staff were friendly the food ok. The flight was half full. I was asked if I wanted a couple of blankets put my ear plugs in spread out over 3 seats and fell asleep. Return trip was cancelled. Turned up at the airport to be told "be here tomorrow at 15.30". They would have paid for an airport hotel but I went back to the city. Journey back was hassle free and pleasant. The bonus was that I wasn't charged for my bicycle. Although my total luggage weight was about 40 kilos!

### Cubana Airlines customer review
LGW to Havana via Holguin and Havana to LGW. Outgoing flight left an hour late but arrived on time. The food was fine and we got one alcoholic drink. Staff were friendly and as the plane was not full there was plenty of room to sleep over 3 seats. Toilets were fine. No inflight entertainment. On return the flight left on time. There was inflight entertainment. Staff were friendly. Toilets clean and the food again fine although you got what you were given. Able to spread out as the plane was not full. Given it was an economy cabin I thought that it was value for money.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
LGW-HOL and HAV-LGW. At the airport we stocked up on magazines drinks and newspapers. The inflight entertainment is shocking make sure you buy drinks etc at the airport because half way through the flight to Holguin they ran out of everything but beer and rum. Dinner was either a choice of Chicken or Beef on both flights and wasn't that bad. The seats were extremely uncomfortable and staff can barely speak English. Outbound to Holguin the plane was half full so we managed to move towards the back of the plane into a seat of two in the middle which meant more legroom. Couldn't hear the announcements whatsoever on both flights and couldn't hear the safety video. To be honest Cubana wasn't as bad as we were expecting just make sure you're prepared with entertainment and drinks etc.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
CUN-HAV-CUN. Both flights delayed for over an hour and although service on the first flight was good the second flight was terrible. Try to avoid or just be patient.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Flight from Gatwick to Holguin was smooth and I was impressed with the food and legroom on the plane. However our next flight with them was a different story. We were flying to Havana at the crack of dawn and were informed there would be a stop off - after only 15 minutes in the air we arrived at another airport and had to disembark before we took off for Havana. If I thought that flight was bad I was in for a shock regarding the last flight home. 4 hours before we were due to leave to the airport we were told our flight was going to be delayed 11 hours. Returning to our hotel room we were told that it was delayed yet again but didn't have any idea for how long. Waited overnight to find out that another 18 hours delay was expected. When we finally got the airport there was a further 4 hour delay! So altogether a 33 hour delay which resulted in us missing our connecting flight back to Scotland and an overnight stay in Gatwick. Flight home also consisted of ham and cheese twice and no inflight entertainment and filthy toilets Will never fly them again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We flew out to Holguin 24 hours late so we lost a days holiday. The service was poor the food going out wasn't too bad but the only drink we had was served with the meal apart from water. The inflight entertainment was non existent which isn't good on a 10 hour flight. After a while the toilets were awful dirty with no soap or toilet paper. Staff didn't seem to care and had no interest in passengers. The flight coming home was delayed 6 hours the food wasn't good - cold meat and cheese for the main meal which was very dry and then for breakfast we were served a dry cheese and ham roll with no butter. Delays are apparently very common with Cubana. The flights spoilt what would have been a good holiday next time we will fly Virgin.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Outbound - My partner and I were travelling Gatwick to Cuba for a two week holiday. We got on the plane to discover the rubbery arm on my seat hanging off. As we took off my partners seat reclined along with the passenger sat in front of her. This continued every time we had a slight incline throughout the flight. About an hour into the flight I asked the stewardess if there would be any films to which she replied "sometimes we do sometimes we don't". Needless to say on this occasion they didn't provide any. When the food cart arrived we learned that they had already run out of wine and as the flight progressed they started to run out of every other liquid content. Inbound - An hour delay we had still not boarded no representative at the gate to advise us. Yet again there was no inflight entertainment with no explanation. We had an average meal which needless to say was our only highlight to this journey. My partner and I are frequent travellers yet have never experienced such an embarrassing display of customer service.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
CUN-HAV. We flew both legs of our journey on a newish Tu-204 which is similar to the 757. To be truthful I was disappointed that the flights weren't on the Yak-42D. The Tu-204 was modern and comfortable although the seats were a bit hard. Flight staff were friendly and attentive enough certainly on par with their US counterparts (which probably isn't saying much). The only downside was that both flights took off about an hour late.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
LGW-HOG. Economy class. Awful journey inflight entertainment non-existent - crackly DVD showing Spanish cartoons and headphones system did not work. Seats broken and uncomfortable. Service very poor and could not hear any of the announcements. When I signalled for a stewardess to come and speak to me I was shrugged at. Temperature was high in the cabin throughout flight. HAV-LGW. Upgraded to Business Class this was really worth it. Staff attentive and the food great. The entertainment (although audio still not working) was better quality. Upgrading to Business Class was like upgrading to get the quality of most other airlines I've flown with in Economy Class.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Gatwick to Holguin. A technical fault delayed us for 5 hours and we were put up in a hotel. We had a 7.30 am call to be told we are going back to the airport but we were without food and drink vouchers. Finally at 6pm we get told to go back to the airport. We check-in for the second time wait and sit on the plane and wait. No communication from Cubana staff for over an hour we are all getting more and more upset and frustrated. We had to get off the plane and told we couldn't get our luggage as Servisair had all gone home. We had to go through passport control again and by this time all passengers were upset and really angry. Cubana left it up to Gatwick staff to look after us and gave us blankets and mats to sleep on the floor which is a joke! We cancelled our holiday with Cubana and booked it with a reputable airline.

Don't fly if you want to get somewhere on time. This airline seems to have far too few planes to operate the schedule - so they constantly re-route planes which means lengthy delays. We were trying to fly Cancun to Havana and got delayed 50 hours. They won't 'cancel' the flight because they then have to pay up to pax. On this leg they checked our bags in at the start so for the entire 50 hour delay we had no bags and no assistance trying to get amenities. Same thing happened when we tried to return to Cancun a week later delayed another 12 hours so our plane could fly a different route. Not prepared for another never ending delay we bought AeroMexico flights - huge cost but at least we got out without missing even more of the holiday.

CCS-HAV-CCS. Received 2 emails a week before the flights that both departure times changed and had to change connection flight on the return. Arrived 4 hrs early to make sure the time wasn't going to change again but the flight was not listed on the departure board. 30 mins before we were supposed to take off there was a line to an unmarked check-in counter next to where we were told to wait finally check-in and told to go to gate 21B which doesn't exist but we all wait in the area of gate 21. 3 hrs later we are escorted to a bus that drives 10 mins away from the airport to an abandoned air strip. Ended up getting to Cuba around midnight and again they drive the bus away from the main terminal to another out of the way receiving area. Lost a day and gained unwanted stress on the way there.

LGW-HAV return. After queuing at check-in for well over 1 hr with around 30 others were told our flight to Havana was overbooked. We all lost a day of our holiday. Similar shambles on return leg - I turned up at Havana airport 3 hrs before take-off only to see that my flight's departure time had been adjusted. Several poor souls who had the misfortune of turning up 2 hrs before the new take-off time were turned away due to the routine overbooking.

MEX-HAV-MEX. Excellent experience both journeys. Newish Airbus A320 clean good leg room and in great condition (possibly ex Taca). On time for both trips ( early departure out of Mexico City). Service was great efficient and pleasant also all crew bilingual (Spanish and English). Food absolutely fine (ham and cheese roll muffin etc). Flights were booked direct with Cubana online and no hiccups with e ticket as issued.

Cancun to Havana round trip. We waited in line for over 2 hours at the baggage counter for the first flight only to be told they had overbooked the flight and we'd have to wait another 8 houapologies. The plane was an older Russian model and it felt like a tank but got us there. People travel to Cuba with the craziest things (because supplies are so limited in Cuba) so check in took forever as folks had complete tire sets for cars mini refrigerators furniture shrink wrapped climbing gear and so on. So we arrived in Havana 9 hours later than scheduled thanks to the booking practices. The plane home left on time and was a much smaller older Russian model. When the air conditioner came on the entire plane filled with white fog. Again we landed without incident but it is not comforting to read the old Russian signs in the plane and realize that your seat is falling apart. Service on both flights was fine. The flight attendants looked like this might be on their pre-retirement leg. Would not fly again.

I think we were lucky with our flights. Both our outbound and inbound flights left and arrived on time. The planes are quite spacious so there is more legroom in economy than other planes I have flown plus the plane wasn't fully booked so we had 3 seats for 2 people so could spread out. The inflight entertainment was awful unless you like watching cuban music videos football documentaries or surgery being performed - all of this in Spanish with bad English dubbing on the top. Food was good for airline but was disappointed with the 1 free drink which came for the meal. The cabin staff are rude - one of whom chewed gum with her mouth open for the whole journey home. Toilets were pretty disgusting.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Gatwick to Holguin okay. The return Havana to Gatwick flight was a farce. An inexplicable 1.5 hour alteration to the proposed departure time followed by further delay despite the aircraft being on station before the scheduled departure time. We only got on the plane after protests by several passengers. The flight was rather boring as many seats had no working lights or audio.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Recommend the following if travelling on Cubana. Wear light clothing as the plane was full and they didn't seem to want to put the air conditioning on! Buy plenty of water nibbles etc (even alcohol) at the airport before going on their flight. The only things they serve on the hostess trolleys are their local beer and havana rum. Water is served in small plastic cups. The food wasn't bad but we didn't get a choice take it or lump it! Entertainment is so bad make sure you take books mags ipod etc. Its a long journey with nothing to do. Would I ever travel with them again - no.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
London Gatwick to Holguin and return from Havana. Flights were on time both ways. On the outbound flight the entertainment system was not working. Food good service was fine. Aircraft was a IL-96 built in 2007. Flight smooth seats were OK. Was fine for the price we had paid.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
After defunct Mexicana left us high and dry in Havana the staff at Cubana was helpful. They had the next flight to Cancun 5 hours after our canceled Mexicana flight and told us while it was booked there would probably be room for us. Come back in 2 hours. One and half hours later they tracked us down in another part of the airport and practically held our hand taking us from purchase to check-in. However then the bad news. The flight was delayed about 45 minutes before takeoff for unknown reasons forcing us to miss our United flight in Cancun (to Denver) and stranding us for two days due to a Labor Day crush in Cancun. And when I saw a wooden floor the first thing when I walked onto the plane and then the exit sign in Russian I was skeptical. And I've seen better overhead bins on city buses. At times I thought it would be my last flight ever but the rubber bands held together and somehow the plane made it.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Just Arrived home from a holiday in Cuba flying with Cubana airlines. I sympathize with the people that had bad experiences but our flight was on time we upgraded to Tropical class which was well worth it for GBP200 and had tons of room and good service. Granted the planes are old and Russian but still have to adhere to the same safety requirements. The inflight entertainment is terrible - in fact it's non existent but the food and drink were fine so take plenty of newspapers books and PSP games for the kids. Cuban's do things differently and the fine details are not perfect by any stretch so if possible I would choose a different and trusted airline if you have a standard you expect. For example I was told Tropical Class was better than Virgin Premium which is just a lie!

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Most frightening flight ever. Our flight was re-routed to Gatwick an hour into the flight due to a mechanical /technical fault. It was the most turbulent one hour flight ever and we were flying so low at one point we thought we would crash. It transpired the hydraulics of the plane had failed though they didn't tell us on the flight so as not to scare us - they told us instead that the plane has too much fuel in it which was why fuel was spewing out of the engine. We suffered a 19 hour delay in total as they has to find a new aircraft for us the next day and we spent the night at the Hilton at Gatwick. On the second plane that was re- routed for us from Paris the next day my husband's seat collapsed and the man behind him had to hold it up for him. Air stewards were nowhere to be seen. Cubana refused to give us a simple letter explaining the 19 hour delay which we may have needed for our insurance claim - they obviously don't care about customer service and have something to hide. Summary: Poorly maintained aircraft scant security measures and old planes with no apparent security checking procedures and poor customer service.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We took the Cubana flight mentioned in the previous review by E Vorster as we were unable to change our schedule and confirm the comments made. The service if you can call it that was terrible not one apology for the delay and a complete lack of interest by the cabin crew. We were lucky to be staying in Havana for three days so did not have to get an internal flight. Our flight back was by another airline as Cubana has problems with its planes again Euro Atlantic which is a charter airline just as bad as Cubana no entertainment toilets not serviced etc. We can only say that we would not fly with either of these airlines again even if they paid us to. If you have the opportunity to fly with another airline even if it costs more then we would suggest you take it. Our worst airline experience ever and we have flown with budget airlines to some of the best.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We've just had a pretty horrendous experience on Gatwick to Havana/Houlguin flight. Things started to go wrong when we received notification from our Tour Operator about a week prior to departure that the flight time had been pushed back by 3hrs. On arrival at Gatwick we were faced with unorganised check-in but managed to upgrade to Business Class for reasonable fee of £150pp. The flight took off on time but about 30 minutes into a very uneasy and bumpy flight the Crew made a rather startling announcement that we were immediately returning to Gatwick. No other explanation given no seat belts checked no reassurance no nothing. After a bumpy yet successful landing at Gatwick greeted by fire engines and applaud from passengers we were herded into a transit lounge via bus and kept waiting for news. Eventually after struggling with airport security to be allowed to use the toilets we were told we would be spending the night at an airport hotel. (This actually turned out to be The Hilton - the least Cubana could do after such a traumatic experience!). In the morning a Cubana rep came with news of a replacement flight that was leaving from Paris and was now going to make a stop at Gatwick to pick up the London passengers. Finally we learned that the 'technical problem' with the plane was due to a fault with the plane hydraulics. Nothing too serious then? We were assured that the replacement plane (although another old Russian Iliushin) could accomodate the London passengers (probably due to the number of people that were now refusing to fly Cubana). We went to the terminal to check in only to find that this replacement plane was destined for Havana (so not doing the Houlguin stop) which for us meant completing an internal flight which no-one could give us a scheduled departure time for. Faced with a total delay of around 32hrs we decided against it and re-arranged our trip for another day with another airline but I heard from another passenger I exchanged numbers with that on arrival at Havana up to 15 peoples bags were missing - left in London by Cubana because the plane was overweight. Take from this what you will - you get what you pay for but I for one will never fly Cubana ever again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We had 9 hour delay at Gatwick with only explanation as 'operational difficulties' The flight then went to Havana instead of our destination which was Holguin we then had to get internal flight. The food was worst we ever had on flight no films and the individual lights did not work so when cabin lights dimmed we couldn't even read. The toilets were not kept clean and ran out of soap and paper towels. If you have the choice please use another airline we certainly will never fly with them again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
On a recent trip to Cuba I got in the lineup for my boarding pass before I realized that I had my expired passport with me instead of my current one. The supervisor on duty went out of her way to help me contact family to bring my passport to the airport. Since this trip would take my son an hour and a half she gave him her phone number to give her his progress as he traveled. She looked into alternate flights that I could take also. Once my son arrived at the airport she personally made sure that my luggage got on my plane since all other luggage had already gone. Our flight was great as was the service and friendliness of all staff.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
London Gatwick to Holguin then Holguin to Havana and back to Gatwick. Our flight was comfortable and staff were pleasant and helpful. Toilets were clean and adequately stocked. The food was hot and a better standard than some food I have had on recent flights with UK charters. We had no problems with transfers or baggage which is still shrink wrapped on the way home. All in all a pleasant experience and I would fly Cubana again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
YU -SNU return. A320 lease from Taca airlines instead of an Ilyushin aircraft. We chose this airline because it had decent schedules. Check-in in Montreal was normal. The legroom was really good for a 3h30 flight. Safety demo shown on video in Spanish with English subtitles announcements onboard also made in French. Service onboard wasn't the best but it was average however one flight attendant didn't seem to like her job. On return flight check-in in Santa Clara airport was slow and disorganized. Sure Cubana is not a great carrier like Air France or Lufthansa but it's okay.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
I had booked to fly to Cuba with Cubana in July 2008. The airline then rescheduled the flights and I was unable to travel on the new dates and so had to cancel. A year later I am still waiting to have my flight refunded. So I can't comment on the quality of the inflight service but the customer care is dreadful. They never answer calls emails letters etc and it looks like I'm going to have to go to court to try and get my money back. Great shame.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Terrible is the only word left in my mind after a flight with Cubana I upgraded my wife and I to Business class on the outbound flight upon arriving at our seats there were two members of staff that begrudgingly vacated when asked. The flight had no inflight entertainment and the safety video was abandoned why? The inbound flight was the worst! Firstly Cubana cancelled our flight opting to fly us to France then we had to arrange our own swap of tickets before boarding. The staff were exceptionally rude; one attendant threw my wife's inflight meal at her!

### Cubana Airlines customer review
I fly Cubana regularly (2 times/year) since 2003. I never encountered the delays and problems some people from Europe reported. For the food onboard I noticed that the quality out of Montreal seems superior than the one out of Habana - prices are sensibly lower than other airlines for the same quality.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
I flew with my husband to Cuba in October with Cubana Business Class. The plane was old and Russian but comfortable with the most leg room we have experienced. The food was fine and catered for us as vegetarians. The staff were helpful polite and attentive. The only criticism was the films were not good.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
LGW- Havana. Stopover in Holguin was difficult after an already long flight and no info given on how long we would wait on the plane before continuing to Havana. Food was minimal but no worse that usual plane food. Advice - take cards a good book and a stash of nibbles and drinks as only two small cups of drink were offered and nothing on sale by way of food or drink. On the plus side the seats chairs reclined way back. Main down side is no individual TVs one film in Spanish on shared screen and hard to see.Plane delayed both ways- 1 hr and 3 hrs respectively.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Cubana must have sorted some problems out. Just returned from 2 week holiday to Cuba which included internal flight - Holguin to Havana. No delays at all newish aircraft - Ilyushin. Staff pleasant and food edible if slightly sub-standard.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Our flight was delayed by 36 hours leaving LGW to Havana and again by 36 hours on the return flight via Paris - plus a 2.5 hour delay in Paris whilst passengers alighted and new passengers boarded. Apparently the "operational difficulties" were as a result of the flight being merged with the Paris flight. The seats were uncomfortable and service was mediocre. Do not get me started on the food from Cuba - it is terrible. It appears that Cubana have been getting away with this for quite some time.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Avoid Cubana Airlines. We went to the airport to find out that the London Gatwick-Havana flight was delayed by over a day without notice. It appeared the plane had come via Paris and French passengers were already on board. No explanation was given we received no compensation or hotel vouchers nothing. Coming back the same thing. We were only told at the resort when checking out that the plane was going a day later. We had to go via Paris where we had to stop to let French passengers get off and new ones come on board. He had to sit on the plane at Paris for over 2 hours whilst the plane was being cleaned. After over 15 hrs on the plane we finally landed at Gatwick. No explanation apology or compensation was given. It appears Cubana is saving money on fuel by combining their Paris and London flights. Therefore our travel insurance is not paying out for the hotel stay. The service was bad too.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We arrived at airport to find flight cancelled (Havana to London due to leave 8pm) - when asked no reason was given. We were told to wait in a queue and no info was forthcoming til passengers got stroppy. They put us up in a hotel for the night (hotel was quite nice - only good point). Next day the flight left on time (11pm) but went via Paris. Flight was delayed by 75 mins in Paris and still no explanation given no communication from flight staff - passengers getting very angry. Eventually we arrive in London after a 27 hour delayed departure and about 13 hours on the plane.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We flew on Cubana to Hrvana via Holguin check in was chaotic. The plane was very old no inflight entertainment and food was not that great either. You have pay for any extra hard or soft drinks. The staff were very old compared to other airlines. The return on was worse. The plane had a fault and we had to wait for another plane. We were kept at the airport for over 8 hours with one sandwich and 1 drink. No toilet paper in the toilets and no inflight entertainment. Please do not book unless you have no choice.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
London Gatwick to Havana return in business class (Club Tropical). Aircraft IL96-300. Outbound flight left 2 hours late but arrived on time as it omitted the scheduled stop in Holgiun. Great for me as I was heading to Havana but no doubt annoying for those going to Holguin. (It missed out Holguin also the following week 28 June - I met people who had been on this flight.) Return flight HAV-LGW left on time and landed 20 minutes early in Gatwick. Friendly and helpful staff on the plane. Food ok but not exciting. Unlimited free drinks (in business class). Films shown were fairly recent although the same on outbound and return flights. Toilets fine. Business class seat not as good as other airlines - only reclines about 45 degrees but there is plenty of leg room. No use of business lounge at Gatwick but you can use decent lounge at Havana. Taking account of the price paid I can't complain. For holiday I'd consider Cubana again. For work I'd choose Virgin. Also flew internally Havana-Holgiun return on Cubana. Approx 100 seater propeller plane. About 2 hours late each way. Offered a free sandwich and drink in airport because of delay. Cramped seating if you're 6'2" like me. On the plane they served free drinks and a small cake.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
Gatwick to Havana via Holquin airport in May. We found cabin crew friendly and entertainment consisted of 2 quite recent good films. We travelled with our 2 children and they were always catered for first which means a lot. Very comfortable flight with adequate leg room much better than some airlines we have flown with. We would fly with Cubana again.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
London Gatwick to Holguin with Cubana was in a newish Air Europe plane. The cabin crew was Cuban. There was no inflight entertainment on the 10 hour flight but meal was edible and staff polite. A few extra complementary drinks would have been welcomed. The return flight from Havana to London Gatwick was in a Russian Ilyushin plane. It was very worrying at first when we discovered this in the departure lounge but thank goodness the plane was new and seat configuration and arrangement of toilets at the back of the plane were good. The staff was Cuban and they were helpful. The evening meal was good and wine was offered. Even the breakfast was a lot better than some of the breakfasts we've experienced on some other scheduled flights. The most surprising aspect with Cubana was the compulsory and free shrinkwrapping of check in luggage as soon as you arrive at the airport - an excellent idea! All in all we were pleasantly surprised with Cubana.

### Cubana Airlines customer review
We may have been lucky - we flew to Holguin and back from Havana and both flights were more or less on time comfortable and uneventful. We didn't have in flight entertainment on the way out but that's often a blessing. I didn't expect extreme comfort but the crew on both trips were friendly.
