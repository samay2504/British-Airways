### “very unpleasant and disturbing”
Not Verified |  My flight experience today was very unpleasant and disturbing. While seated at Row 29, I overheard a female crew member making rude remarks and loudly shouting at someone, possibly a fellow crew member. Her behavior appeared quite aggravated and became a topic of discussion among passengers seated nearby. I had been looking forward to a peaceful flight to Denpasar, so this disruption by the crew of Jetstar Asia on Flight 3K241 was quite bothersome. I urge Jetstar Asia to review the well-being and communication among its crew members. Such public shouting reflects poorly on Jetstar Asia's reputation and significantly disrupts passengers' flight experiences, particularly those eagerly anticipating their holidays. Thank you. For anyone considering Jetstar Asia flights, I encourage you to reconsider.

### "Tried to request for wheelchair assistance"
Tried to request for wheelchair assistance for my aged mother. Every other flights offers free service. Jetstar asked me to pay $70 for that. How can Changi Airport allow that? Absolutely disgusting.

### "disappointed and discouraged"
I am reporting what the Jetstar Airlines did to my flight.. The travel Agency in Sweden where I booked and paid my whole ticket already confirmed my flight. And I checked it and all set confirmed and done. After 2 weeks the Jetstar Asia changed the flight schedule and they want both my travel Agency and The Jetstar to confirm the changes on my flight and I did it. As I checking in during my flight schedule The Jetstar Asia pending my flight without knowing that I have to pay and they charge me a total of 7'600 philippine peso at the airport. I have no other option because they dont want to confirm my flight. I asked them what is the payment for? It is for the Change of your flight. REALLY! Do I need to pay for the Airlines cancelation or Change flight they did? I already accepted the option they gave to confirm the changes but they never specified that I need to pay for that action! It should be refunded instead of Charges! I asked them what happened to my original flight they said it is already canceled. I am so disappointed and discouraged

### “Delayed luggage”
Not Verified | Delayed luggage. Had to go all the way back to the airport to collect it. Don’t fly with this airline if you want to have a good experience or even an acceptable one.

### "Boarding was chaotic"
Have had a chance to fly with 3K685 one week after they moved to T4. Boarding was chaotic and taking long time cause flight is so full and I observe the front row of aircraft(9V-JSI) the side layer of overhead console keep dropping and crew manage to tape it temporarily. I get no idea how come the ATC instructed the pilot to taxi to furthest point and taxi slowly around 25 mins when we just taking off from nearby runway 02R and the most frustrating is ATC let the CX A350 behind us to take off first while we just hold short the runway so long. But kudos to aircrew we manage to reach KL within 33 mins flight duration.

### "Disappointing experience with Jetstar"
Disappointing experience with Jetstar. Despite paying extra for ticket cancellation, the process turned out to be a series of challenges. The provided coupons had incorrect numbers, making them unusable until I discovered the missing digits after hours of attempting to reach customer support. To make matters worse, one coupon is restricted to the original ticket holder's name, preventing me from using it. Jetstar's approach seems geared towards making it difficult for customers to get a refund. From incorrect coupon numbers to unresponsive support, it's been a frustrating journey.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Watch out for flying with Jetstar as they can change schedule on your flight and not offer any reasonable assistance. My early October return flight to Singapore was just rescheduled by them from a late evening to early morning flight (more than 12 hours difference). They suggested I fly back on the date of my outbound flight from Singapore (so I will literally only be in KL outside airport customs for 4 hours) or fly back a day later. They said they are helpful by not charging me for the rebooking and no other offer of assistance despite my request. As the Jetstar agent pointed out to me "I'm afraid we do not provide accommodation services and a compensation is not what we can offer at the moment. Please be reminded of the conditions of carriage: Jetstar does not guarantee it will be able to carry you and your Baggage in accordance with the scheduled date and time of the flights specified. Schedules may change without notice for a range of reasons including but not limited to bad weather, air traffic control delays, strikes, technical disruptions and late inbound aircraft. Flight times do not form part of your contract of carriage with us. Before we accept your Booking, we or our Authorized Agents will tell you the scheduled departure time of your flight and it will be shown on your Itinerary Receipt. We may need to change the scheduled departure time of your flight after your Itinerary Receipt has been issued. If you give us or our Authorized Agents contact information, we or they will try to let you know about any changes. In any event, prior to your flight you should check to ensure your flight times have not changed. Except as provided for by Convention or any applicable laws, such as the Australian Consumer Law, we will not be liable to you for any losses that you may incur if you fail to do so. You have been warned ... I will never fly with them again.

### "flight delayed for eight hours"
Not Verified |  An absolutely nightmarish experience with Jetstar. I booked a flight from Singapore to Jakarta on August 11, 2023, scheduled for 7:50 am. However, the incompetence and disregard for their passengers displayed by Jetstar were truly shocking. Not only is the flight delayed for eight hours, but the manager on duty exhibited an appalling level of rudeness and ineptitude when dealing with customer inquiries. To begin with, receiving an email about the delay at 4:45 am, when I was already at the airport, was beyond frustrating. It was abundantly clear that Jetstar had been aware of the delay for a significant period of time, yet they chose to inform passengers at the last possible moment. This level of negligence and lack of consideration for their customers' time and inconvenience is completely unacceptable. As the delay dragged on for a grueling eight hours, the total lack of assistance and information from the Jetstar staff became increasingly apparent. To make matters worse, the manager on duty was shockingly rude and dismissive, responding to our inquiries with a cold "no" to every question asked. As paying customers, we should be treated with respect and provided with assistance in such trying situations. Instead, we were met with hostility and an utter lack of empathy. It was abundantly clear that the manager's sole objective was to brush us off rather than fulfill their duty to accommodate and support customers. Furthermore, the absence of any form of compensation or apology for the significant inconvenience caused by the eight-hour delay only magnifies the frustration and disappointment. Jetstar Airline appears to have no regard for the impact their delays have on their customers' plans, schedules, and overall travel experience.

### "Unable to check in on time"
Unable to check in on time, was late by 1 min. I arrived to check in station at 1456h, flight is at 1540h and the counter staff at SIN terminal 4 was not able to help me out to manually check in or at least check with control regarding late check in. I had to book a whole new flight or else my itinerary will be disrupted. Not willing to help even if it is a 3 min thing, made me lose time and money. Counter staff was not at all helpful and kept shoving me to book another flight on my own way by all means.

### "an irresponsible airline"
I’ve checked in my luggage in good condition, yet when I was returned with a spoilt luggage lock, I was told it’s not under compensation!? The whole luggage is not usable anymore, what do you mean by not compensable for damage lock? Jetstar Asia is an irresponsible airline!

### "worst experience I've ever had"
Not Verified |  The customer support of Jetstar Asia is the absolute worst. The only way you can add baggage is by calling their number. This alone costs me more than 130 euros because their employees are unqualified for their job. The only way you can pay is by credit card. After using my credit card for this it took only a week before my credit card was fraudulent, so that I could no longer use my credit card on vacation, and had to apply for a new credit card. The airplane was too cold and stank. Overall the worst experience I've ever had.

### "beware the check-in luggage policy"
Not Verified |  I purchased additional carry-on option so that I can carry two bags up to 14Kg. At the check-in desk, however, I was told one of the luggage was too big and had to be checked-in with 55000 KRW pay. I protested that it should be allowed to be carried in because it's almost the same dimension as my other luggage, only looking bigger because it's an old-fashioned two-wheeler. Of course, my protest was not accepted (although the manager admitted it was on the borderline). That was first of frustration that ruined our 60th birthday trip. On arriving Sydney, then, we learned our connecting flight to Brisbane was cancelled, and we had to stay overnight in Sydney screwing our itinerary (We managed to find late flight from another airline that the staff at the Jetstar refused to find themselves). Frustrating start of the trip. On the way back, I was ready to pay for check-in the problem luggage, but the staff at the check-in desk said it is allowable, so I carried in both bags! So, the same luggage, depending on who the desk staff was, was not allowed one way and allowed the other way. So, if you want to buy additional option for the carry-on luggage, pray you get the right staff at the check-in desk. Otherwise, you'd have to pay extra around $40 (US dollar) for check-in, without getting the extra check-in option payment reimbursed. I complained this to the customer service, and of course the person I chatted with said there was nothing s/he could do it. So, once happened, there is little to no chance to get your money reimbursed. Just beware the check-in luggage policy can be very arbitrary.

### "Overall bad experience"
Firstly, upon our arrival, the flight attendant was impatient and had a bad attitude. There was not enough space for our carry on bags above our seats and they gave us attitude by blaming us for not coming 'early enough' and because our bags are 'too big' - All of our bags were smaller than the dimension limits!! Clearly that's Jetstar's fault that they don't leave enough space for people's luggage. Secondly, the flight attendants all clearly saw that the people behind us were causing trouble by being very noisy the entire 6 hour flight and annoying everyone around them. We kept telling them to be quiet but instead of the staff helping to deescalate the situation they kept giving them more and more alcohol - they were clearly drunk! What happened to RSA and not giving drinks to intoxicated people? The more drinks they had the more noisy and bothersome they became. Overall bad experience and I would not recommend Jetstar to anyone.

### "Great value for money"
Very decent airline. Great value for money and no real complaints. If I had one complaint it's more of the ground check in, queues tend to be form very long since they wait until the last moment to check in (from MNL). On the Flight back (From SG), the check in was fast since it was mostly machines but the gate or at least the access to the waiting area before the gate is closed until a few minutes before boarding in my case so everyone either had to awkwardly wait in the walkways before or just proceed there when it was almost time. Note as a budget carrier, their gate is quite far from the shops and other waiting areas so it might be a problem going back and forth for older passengers.

### "worst airline customer support"
Not Verified |  One of the worst airline customer support I have ever encountered. Until now, living in Singapore was spotless but Jetstar has ruined that. I booked the flight wrongly and tried to cancel the booking under 1 hour, which is also their 1-hour-fix policy condition. Unfortunately, Jetstar did everything so I couldn't use this policy. I was unable to cancel the booking on the website (no option to cancel or change the destination), call the customer service to ask the same (it was outside of their working hours) or get any meaningful support from their virtual assistant (refering me to the same website that cannot execute the 1-hour-fix policy). When I called them the next morning, they refused to cancel my booking and required me to pay the change fee (if I wanted to change). So, their 1-hour-fix policy only works between 6AM and 10 PM, when their phone customer support works. Makes me really sad and hurt to see that these kinds of things can happen in lovely Singapore.

### "customer service and logistics were abysmal"
I'm not even complaining about the flight cancellation (actually, we had boarded the 2pm plane from KUL to SIN- were then told to disembark, instructed twice about subsequent delays and then that it was cancelled with the next flight occurring the next evening.) But the follow up customer service and logistics were abysmal. It took four hours to exit the airport and onto the overnight hotel. I was not informed that the replacement flight was delayed again - had to hear it from another customer. When you try to contact customer service you're forced to use a live chat system which keeps you waiting for ages, and when it finally connects and if you haven't responded immediately (because you waited thirty mins and needed to look at I don't know, work emails) then they'll disconnect you. When I got through they said they'd send me an email with my case Id. It never came. When I enquired again they told me the garbled email address they'd sent it to (eg 128djfhsks@xx dot com) which was clearly a dummy email that was generated by trip.com the third party. I told them my email. They promised they'd send it to the right address. They never did. This airline is basically - fly at your peril - if you have a complaint, we'll pretend enough to care so we don't break the law, but we'll make it as difficult as possible for you to bother complaining and hope you'll give up eventually and not bother us.

### "do not recommend booking with them"
Thursday 24 November 2022. Arrived at KLIA2 to check in for my 2:45 pm Jetstar flight to Singapore, only to be told that the flight had been overbooked by eight seats, and I would not be able to check-in. The next flight I could take would be at 9:25 pm. Offered a voucher and meal vouchers (that can only be redeemed at one unremarkable outlet). I spoke with customer service to ask them to arrange an earlier flight, but this was a complete waste of 10 minutes of my time. I've also used the 'Chat' function through the Jetstar Asia website. Waste of time and effort (not even sure it was a real person). I will not book a Jetstar flight again and will not include Jetstar Asia in any legs of international flights I take in future. I do not recommend booking with them. The customer service is non-existent, and the 'commercial practice' (a term used in a weak apology/excuse letter I was given) of overbooking is disrespectful of customers. Clearly Jetstar are putting their desire for profit above any concern for customer service and satisfaction. The sooner Jetstar Asia goes out of business, then the better this will be for travellers.

### "Please take some action"
I am taking flight from KL to Singapore at 9:25pm 5/11/2022. All the passengers waited at the waiting hall for 1 hour but no update at all about the delay. Until some of the passengers go complain then the crew stand out and say checking problem from aircraft, waiting for update. Is fine to wait but at least announce right? What kind of service is this? Please take some action with it and I had wasted so much time on this waiting.

### "unfairness of this company"
Not Verified |  Blown away with the absolute rudeness and unfairness of this company and its customer service. I brought a guitar as a carry on from Bali to Singapore with no issues on a jetstar flight. On my flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, they refused to allow me to take my guitar as a carry on and required me to check it. They told me it was the previous attendant’s mistake on the flight from Bali. I asked for a free bag check and wrap to make sure the guitar would be safe, and they declined, and insisted I pay for their mistake. The guitar was not padded and was not ready for checking. I ended up leaving the guitar in the airport since cost of wrapping the guitar and checking it was almost as much as the guitar, and the wrapping likely would not have kept the guitar safe. The staff was incredibly rude and talked back to me when I was just trying to find a solution to my problem. Never flying with them again. Check bags are incredibly overpriced as well and the weight limit for carry on and checked bags is ludicrously low. Seats are tight and uncomfortable. We almost missed our flight from Oahu to Sydney because the staff didn’t communicate that our bags were going through to Bali even though we told the first attendant that they were and she told us all was set.

### "won't extend the credit voucher"
Jetstar cancel my direct flight from KNO (Kualanamu airport) to Singapore because of the covid 19, And give me credit voucher. Problem is Jetstar haven't open direct route from KNO up till now (7 may 2022). I tried to ask the customer services when Will they open the direct flight from KNO but they cannot give me answer. And they won't extend the credit voucher expired date which expire on 31 December 2022.

### "such a wonderful staff"
Very good experience with such a wonderful staff from Juanda International Airport. Especially Lopez, Sulis, Eka, and Ganda. Very helpful and friendly. Thank you so much for helping me a lot when during check in time, amazing service! All the best.

### "a really bad experience"
Had a really bad experience with Jetstar Asia when I'm moving back from Malaysia to Singapore during the Covid19 Pandemic. The flight was underbooked, with more than 90% of the seats empty. Despite this, the service was lacklustre and they were giving me a hard time during the check-in process and squeeze out more money from me with a list of fees. My flight was supposed to come with a meal, and I paid for it already with the ticket, yet during the flight, no meals were provided. It infuriates me that amidst such a difficult time, they're still more concerned about ripping their customers rather than providing satisfactory service to ensure customers would stay loyal and use their service again once the pandemic is over. I have decided that I would never be using this airline again in the future.

### "not allow for full refund of the monies"
We know that all the airlines are having difficulty during covid 19 pandemic, the Jetstar website let me book for the trip but cancelled the flight in a week time and not allow for full refund of the monies. I have book Singapore Airlines before for going to Europe and I got a full refund of $$ back. They might survive during covid 19 pandemic, but will lose the confidence from customer forever. Will never never go back to this airline, and I'm glad that is book for a cheap trip.

### "distasteful bait-ful experience"
We were monitoring the prices for flights to SIN-CGK for the past two days. Prices were ranging from S$96 and above. On the third day, Jetstar had added 4 flights/day for the whole Month of Sept 2020 and dropped the price of their tickets by half. We thought it was a luxury to have 4 flights/day in this Covid era. Naively, we bought the ticket for my domestic helper at S$54. Two weeks later, we received an email that flight was cancelled due to Covid (like it wasn’t 2 weeks ago?). Terms and condition: No refund allowed. We were suppose to redeem other flights using credit voucher. No big deal, we would just select the next available date. The thing is the prices has been inflated back to S$118. This has left me a very distasteful bait-ful experience with Jetstar.

### "these ones are unscrupulous"
I booked these tickets for us already the 11th february this year and then covid-19 came along and destroyed everything. Impossible to get in touch with this airline I tried to reach out to them via chat on the 11th of april to ask for the alternatives and if I could get my money back so that I at least could book other flights for us to go back home to our own country as country after country was going into lockdown. The woman in the chat told me that as long as it hadnt been cancelled I couldnt do anything or get any of my money back. Her advise was for me to wait until the flight was actually suppose to leave and so I did. The 18th May I got an e-mail saying that our flight was not gonna leave on the 3rd june and that I needed to fill in a form to get my money back. I went online and filled the form out as soon as possible as my economy has been hit real hard due to this situation of being stuck in another country far to long than I anticipated. 2 days ago, the 10th june I received another e-mail saying that my refund would be allocated to my bank account some time during the coming 14 days. I am getting a total refund on 9 per cent for all the tickets i booked and the rest this airline is apparently keeping to themselves! And worst of all, I cant reach them! I cant email them because they dont respond. Their chat hours doesnt work and there´s no way I can fill in another form to make them contact me again. It is incredible in these hard times that a huge airline does something like that to their potential customers. So those considering this airline - re-think and find yourself another one because these ones are unscrupulous and cannot even consider the impact they have on travellers that got into this horrible situation in the first place.

### "refused compensation"
Jakarta to Singapore. Damaged baggage and refused compensation. My baggage is a backpack that I've purchased in USA sometime 12 months ago, which I do not have a receipt and was paid for in cash. But I found a same design but in a different material, that is what I used as proof to claim for the amount of my backpack, but Jetstar insist on every emails, that they have to follow protocol and refused to even understand the situation. I know there are certain protocols to follow, but my case isn't something that can be resolved if to follow strictly to protocol of having a quotation from a luggage repairer and officially on a letter head, or receipt or credit card statement, which I've none to provide. Jetstar is making it very difficult and very much trying their best to avoid any claims for damaging passenger's property. On my numerous emails asking for an clear explanation on how my backpack can be so badly damaged, when there was a FRAGILE tag with special note to take extra care hand written by ground staff? I didn't get a reply.

### "okay cabin crew"
Denpasar Bali to Singapore. On time, really friendly gate agent at DPS easy boarding by groups, and okay cabin crew. Website is really easy to navigate and add on/remove services on request.

### "my carry on baggage exceeded"
Not Verified |  Baggage policy is terrible. I was offloaded because i got excess baggage which i am willing to pay by card, but they say that their system is down so they can only accept cash. I’m willing to pay for my excess baggage but they‘re should be the one adjusting since it’s their system is the one that got issue. Staff are not helpful and non apologetic at all. I wasn't allowed to board the plane because my carry on baggage exceeded.

### "the usual budget flight"
Jakarta to Singapore. Perhaps thanks to the coronavirus panic, the flight was half empty and everything went faster than usual. I got an entire row of empty seats to stretch out on and we bith keft and landed a bit early. Otherwise, it was the usual budget flight with no freebies.

### "terrible in terms of consistency"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore with Jetstar Asia. Absolutely terrible in terms of consistency. Also encountered a one hour delay flying from Singapore to Malaysia. If you value your time, please fly with another airline as two out of two times I encountered a one hour plus delay. They really need to step up their game. Whether your flight is delayed is just a coin flip.

### "we have never heard a thing from JetStar"
Manila to Johannesburg via Singapore. We were booked to fly 3K764 on 14 Jan from Manila to Singapore with Jetstar Asia. On waking up to the news of the Taal volcano we decided to check our flights only to find that our Jestar flight for the 14th Jan had been cancelled for many days prior to the volcano but with no notification from Jetstar to ourselves. Ethiopian quickly re-arranged our flights which meant us laying over for an additional 2 days but we have never heard a thing from Jetstar about flight cancellations. Same thing happened to another Ethiopian pax whom we met in the offices that day trying to change his flight.

### "65 bucks on random bag check"
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. I am flying on 23rd jan the price was overly high for such an airline. Staff at the airport payment counter Weigh my bag and tell me it will cost me 65 Singapore dollar if I want to take my bag as I was 2 Kg extra. He was holding on to my bag as if I would run away and not pay for it. This flight was suppose to be my flight back home for the holiday season and now my mood were all spoilt thanks to these kind of staff.. you should really look into your price of your ticket if you still wish to charge anyone the extra 65bucks.. for a 300 Singapore dollars flight on a Budget airline without any service and charging 65 bucks on random bag check.. seriously?

### "baggage policy absolutely ridiculous"
Singapore to Bangkok. General comment on Jetstar Asia baggage policy - it is absolutely ridiculous. 7kg combined hand luggage is not enough for a day trip. I was charged $65 SG for an 8.2kg laptop bag. How I was treated during the weighing and payment process was disgraceful. I will never fly this airline again. I am a regular business and personal flyer (60+ flights per year). I will avoid at all costs.

### "do not care about costumers"
Clark to Darwin via Singapore. First flight delayed ~2h. The crew knew at Clark Airport that I would not reach the next flight to Darwin and I had separate tickets with the same company. Not a single word from staff. At Singapore transfer terminal they refused to give my boarding pass Singapore to Darwin as I needed to clear immigration at Singapore. (Carry on 7kg only) and do not understand as I am in the transit zone and traveling with an Australian passport. Made it to Darwin flight, excellent customer service from staff. Jetstar never again - scammers that do not care about costumers.

### "Overall an efficient flight"
Singapore to Taipei. Flight departed slightly late but arrived on time. Leg room was small, as expected on a Low cost carrier. Cabin crew were professional but lack warmth. Overall an efficient flight from point to point.

### "not even apologetic"
Singapore to Hong Kong delayed 4.5 hours. The flight time was 9.30am, the bus transfer picked all the passengers and let us wait for about 10mins inside the bus while the sun is high up. When we board the plane at 9.35am theres an announcement the flight will be delayed. Delayed for 2 hours plus for technical problem. Your airline shouldnt have let us board yet. Its already almost lunch time and no offer of anything not even a free meal to compensate for such a delay! Our time was wasted, the entire day was gone. I asked a male attendant why the plane is not leaving yet and hes not even apologetic.

### "Customer service is poor"
Singapore to Manila. It was our first time flying a budget airline, hoping to save a few hundred dollars. It ended up costing us more. Customer service is poor. Our flight was delayed which caused us to miss our connecting flight and when we called customer service they said they have no record of any of their flights delayed. I had to send them a screenshot. You can't call them directly and have to communicate via chat. I've requested an insurance later and have yet to receive it.

### "would not fly with them again"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. This is the 2nd time that I have encountered this problem. Flight delays are common and I don't blame the airline if delays occur from time to time. However please have the courtesy to inform passengers upon check in that the flight is estimated to be delayed for how long and update the airport boards. The flight departure time was not updated and everyone came to the gate because it was shown on the board to be final call. Imagine everyone's frustration when at the original departure time, we still have yet to board the plane! Both ground staff and air crew were also poorly trained. Row 6 to 9 were the last group allowed to board and the cabin crew did not help ensure that the cabin bag storage space were kept free. We were told to place our cabin bags all the way to the back of the plane because our original spaces were fully taken up! When a passenger feedback to the cabin crew on this matter, she was told its on a first come first serve basis. How is it first come first serve, when we were only allowed to board last?! When we told them that it's because we were allowed to board last, the cabin crew blamed the ground staff instead. Flight delay, incompetent ground staff and cabin crew, who only knows how to blame each other instead of resolving the problem at hand and appease already disgruntled passengers. If given a choice, would not fly with them again.

### "No service recovery"
Singapore to Danang. On 8Dec my Jetstar flight 3k541 was supposed to depart Singapore at 6:50pm. However upon push out, the captain mentioned there is some technical issue with the plane so we have to return to the gate to let ground staff to check. After the checks, the captain mentioned to us “Good news, the issue is resolve and we will be able to fly in 20 minutes. However the captain mentioned once again they have to do further checks and sign some documents so we have to return to the gate again, from the start when announced there was a delay, no service recovery was given to us, no drinks or nuts or anything was given to us while waiting . So after about another 30 minutes wait we were told that due to company policy they have to arrange a replacement aircraft for us at gate C17. If there is a need for us to change aircraft at the start, why do you let us have false hope saying we will be at the sky within 20 mins and let us just wait in the aircraft like some idiots, Furthermore, from E24 to C17 was so far apart and very long distance, why can’t the replacement aircraft be parked nearer, it have cause much inconvenience to my grandparents. We finally boarded the plane at about 9:50 and took the skies at 10:45pm. From 6:50 to 10:45 it is a more than 3 hours delay! No refreshment voucher was given to us. No service recovery, letting passengers just wait and stranded.

### "an uneventful short hop"
Jakarta to Singapore with Jetstar Asia. Flight left somewhat late. Other than that, it was an uneventful short hop. Seats rather stiff and unconfortable, staff seemingly somewhat stressed out or tired, but they took us there at a low cost.

### "their extra baggage fees"
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Jetstar has their extra baggage fees as with all airlines however their unscrupulous extra charging methods must stop. My flight costed $60-70, the extra Baggage fee was $60? So unreasonably high the extra baggage fee. The metal frame at their counters are smaller than their measurements. I’ll avoid this airline forever. Be reasonable my luggage was only 3-4kg as I knew it could exceed 7kg carry on.

### "the check-in counter was closed"
Phuket to Singapore. My initial flight departure time with Jetstar was 10:00 PM. When I tried to check in online in the afternoon the same day, Jetstar website showed me that the flight was delayed, and that the new departure time was 10:35. So, I arrived at the airport at 9:31. As per policy, the check- in counter closes 45min before the departure time. So, I was within policy. Upon arrival, I discovered that the check-in counter was closed. At the information counter they called the airline and I’ve been informed that the check in counter closes 1 hr before the original departure time. Which is nonsensical, since the whole point of informing the passenger about the delay is to let us know in advance and reducing the wait time in the airport. After a while of discussion over the phone, I was redirected to one  office and then to another. At first, they doubted how could I find out about the delay. And asked to show the proof. So, I showed the Jetstar webpage. They went back to check the system, but that didn’t help. Then their explanation was “How come all other passengers came on time and only you are late?”. Seriously? How do I know. Perhaps they didn’t try to check-in online. Then they said we always wait to the passengers, you were just too late. I was offered no refund, only to buy another ticket at my own cost.

### "a small bag they would weigh"
Not Verified | Manila to Singapore. Singapore to the Philippines my hand-carry baggage weighed 6.4kg which is in line of the 7kg baggage allowance rule. Personal bag is never ever been included. I’ve heard rumours of now even personal bag and laptop bag they will aim to get money from the passengers. They will even hold your boarding pass until you pay for it. I thought it was just a rumour until it happened to me. I'm flying back to Singapore and while at the counter they ask to weighed my hand-carry bag even my personal bag. I’ve always taken the same flight and same bag but its the first time this happened to me. Even a small bag they would weigh just to get money.

### "Never again with Jetstar"
Horrible flight experience: 1-hour flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur was delayed for 30 minutes. Also, they forced me and at least 10-20 passengers to ship our carry on luggage because they didn't have enough space. So I had to waste another 30 minutes at the airport. In total, I spent as much time waiting because of Jetstar as I did on board of the plane. Definitely there are way better alternatives in Asia. Never again with Jetstar.

### "went wrong with taking luggage"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The flight turns out perfectly and it went wrong with taking luggage at belt 17, frame and wheels slightly spoilt mean like it was a part of quotation letter or statutory declaration letter to submit in order to claim the bag from Jetstar.

### "Crew polite and helpful"
Jakarta to Singapore with Jetstar Asia. Flight departed ahead of schedule. Crew polite and helpful. Unfortunately, most seats didn't recline, making sleep impossible on a middle of the night flight. Otherwise everything was OK.

### "charged $65SGD for 3kg excess carry on"
Taipei to Singapore. Worse airline ever, was charged $65SGD for 3kg of excess carry on and I wanted to remove the items on the spot but staff was giving excuses to not delay the time and gave us horrible attitude. Was not notified that flight was delayed by 1h 40 minutes until I reached the boarding area. Charged $65 and flight got delayed this is the worse service I’ve encountered, never experience such service from Jetstar before this is the first time and I’m horrified.

### "acceptable and reasonably priced"
Bangkok to Singapore with Jetstar Asia. From past experience I find budget carriers in Asia to be aerial buses, you get what you pay for and not much else. The flight was just that, it left on time and we arrived. The plane was an old airbus that had seen better days and was in a fairly run down condition, the back of seats were showing all the signs of a well used plane and the one in front of me would not return to the correct upright position meaning my already tight seating position was made worse. These airlines / planes are configured to fit the maximum number of Asian travellers and as such make them tight for bigger aussies. Generally the staff were concerned with getting everyone on and off as quickly as possible. However the flight was not bad just tight and endurable for it's 2 hour length. That however would be the limit. I dont believe I would want to be in those seats for longer. For a shortish hop around Asia it was acceptable and reasonably priced. I would use them again but not for longer than two hours.

### "actually had 52kg in total"
Penang to Singapore. I don't like feeling hustled! My girlfriend and I ordered tickets online without having a way to weigh our luggage. We were allowed 40kg for baggage claim but actually had 52kg in total. Cost for the difference came out to double our flight costs combined. Our only solution was to stuff as much clothing we could into our carry ons which only made a 5kg difference. The attendant was not helpful with solutions or cost effective options. What's weird is that we're putting the same amount of weight onto the plane!

### "Service on board was rather warm and efficient"
I was pretty impressed by Jetstar Asia, which is not the one in Australia, Japan or Vietnam. This one is based in Singapore, I have been told they have the better service than the other 3, and I could testify that. At Hong Kong airport T2, another counter was opened to cater for passengers who checked in online, hardly anyone did, so I didn't have to wait long to check in. Service on board was rather warm and efficient, departure and arrival was on time. The chicken rice I ordered was surprisingly delicious, and came with a very nice locally made Udders ice cream, a nice finishing touch to my meal. Rest of the flight was very uneventful and restful, the 4 crew worked hard from beginning to end. The flight experience was really way better than I had expected!

### "it was a bad experience"
Manila to Singapore. Airline personnel at Manila airport have bad customer service, unfortunately the ticket that I bought had no luggage allowance (be warned to double check your ticket) or else you have to pay a ridiculous charge of $80 for 1 luggage. The airline check in system is one of the worst, it took me around 1.5hr to get to the counter. Seat clearance is so small and designed for 5’5” and below. Flight crew don’t smile. Overall, it was a bad experience. I have travelled with different airlines, unfortunately, I would not recommend Jetstar Asia due to poor customer service.

### "overall a great flight"
Flew Bali to Singapore. Jetstar Asia was an impressive and great airline to travel with. Boarding commenced on time which was great. The crew were also cheerful and friendly. When conducting onboard service, the crew were also careful and considerate. It was overall a great flight and I would definitely fly Jetstar Asia again.

### "airline’s extortion scheme"
Singapore to Clark. My family and I booked international flights from the USA to Singapore flying through JAL. We stayed in Singapore for 3 days then booked jetstar to the Philippines. Our luggage allowance with JAL was okay but with Jetstar we were charged excessively. We ended up paying an amount close to the fare of one person. If you go to their site - there are no clear rules about this. They just want to extort as much as they want. Some of their Singapore staff are also rude and dismissive. What good experience I had in Singapore was marred by this airline’s extortion scheme.

### "carry-on had to get checked in"
I’m flying over to Manila from Tokyo right now and was recently told that the bag that I’ve been taking as carry-on everywhere along my Jetstar travels had to get checked in, despite meeting the weight and size requirements. Isn’t it strange that there’s a severe lack of consistency across the Jetstar kiosks about what can be taken on as carry-on luggage versus check-in luggage? This may obviously occur at kiosks from other airlines, but what happened here at Jetstar threw my entire travel itinerary for a loop. Being my only means of carrying my laptop back and forth, I had to then awkwardly carry my laptop around like an idiot instead of being able to leave my belongings in a bag that, I was told, was acceptable to have on board. Not only that, but the kiosk was severely unaccommodating. At the end of the day, my message to Jetstar is to get your rules and policies together. Had I known that I had to have a different bag, I would’ve been able to prepare an adequate solution as opposed to frantically having to rearrange my belongings and receiving a severely suboptimal customer service experience. I want Jetstar policies and rules to be both communicated and implemented effectively. That way, other customers don’t have to have their entirely good trip end on such a sour note.

### "offers fairly decent service"
Bangkok to Singapore. As mentioned before in previous reviews, Jetstar offers fairly decent service and seats at a competitive price. Ground staff and the air crew are usually very polite and helpful. There was an instance where the crew had actually prepared some candy to be distributed after landing. A really thoughtful gesture.

### "I have had no issues"
Singapore to Bangkok. Jetstar offers tickets that are priced competitively. I have had no issues with Jetstar thus far. Ground staff, as well as the cabin crew have been respectful and helpful throughout the entire trip.

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever. At Phuket the Jetstar Airways crew checked my baggage but not to my final destination, explained that it’s impossible and I would have to check my luggage again. But dropping off my luggage again means taking 2x passport controls and security checks for which I don’t have time due to short connections. Now there is a huge risk that my luggage won’t come to my final destination. Double check those situations twice. This is very confusing. I’m disappointed that the crew did such a thing without checking.

### "338SGD last minute to change flight"
Not Verified |  Taipei to Singapore. Jetstar is the worst airline. I booked 2 tickets for my Friend and I, same plane, same date, same booking order. When I received the confirmation order my flight time was the same, same date but 1 month after, but it was the right month for my Friend. They charged me 338SGD last minute to change my flight. I just hate this airline, I don’t respect you, you make mistakes, don’t take the credit of those mistakes and charge crazy amount of money.

### "crew was friendly and efficient"
Yangon to Singapore (Flight 3K584 seat 1C). The online ticket purchase was easy. I was positively surprised with my check-in as well as the in-flight experience. I had to catch a connecting flight (with a different airline) and the check-in staff was very friendly and allocated a seat at the front so that I can disembark quickly. The crew was friendly and efficient.

### "very helpful ground staff"
Singapore to Penang. I was running late and met this very helpful ground staff helped to speed up my check-in using the automated system and completed it within a couple of minutes. She does the job with professionalism and a smile. If more airline staffs are like her, it will help take away some of the hassle of air travel.

### "Don't recommend this company "
It was supposed to be quick, domestic flight. Ho Chi Minh - Phu Quoc. I was waiting to check in, when the clerk said that his stand was closed and he instructed me to go to different attendant. There was another passenger waiting too, with some styrofoam package, it took quite a while. I only had my backpack with me and was hoping to get everything sorted out quickly. The lady said that I was literally 3 minutes late and she can't let me go, even though there was plenty of time. She said no remuneration, only possible thing was another flight, 9 hours later + extra fee. They treated me really poorly, needless to say. The worst flying related experience ever. Don't recommend this company at all, wish there was an option to give zero starts, they don't deserve even one.

### "disappointed with Jetstar"
Yangon to Singapore. Totally disappointed with Jetstar. Feedback to Jtstar online about their poor management in checking in group check in. On 22 Feb, there is a big group checking in, group calling out to their members to filled up their luggage weight to maximize and not pay extra $$. The queue is super long and the staff did nothing. I went to online jetstar feedback and told them about having a group check in and not to delay other passengers. The only reply I get from Jetstar is they will feedback to their team leaders. And they shut off my online chat without letting me reply.

### "impressed with the cabin staff"
Not Verified | Penang to Singapore. Flight 3K678. 15 Jan 2019. My wife and I were very impressed with the cabin staff and the help with me needing a wheelchair to the plane. Cabin staff very attentive and polite. Well done

### "the worst experience"
Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh city. Had the worst experience with Jetstar and I do not recommend you to fly with them. You get a short amount of time to check-in, 2 hours, they still opened 15 minutes too late. They put you in a overcrowded bus, you could not move an inch. They had a full bus go to the airplane, while I was waiting in the second bus, I noticed another bus (or the bus who got back from the airplane) parking behind us, I knew this bus shouldn't be overloaded. The third had less than 15 passengers, why didn't they just distribute them normally.. They had the bus stop in the blazing sun for several minutes. Now I made a mistake not carrying my ticket on me (I gave it to my girl), but right from the start this flight attendent put up an aggressive tone towards me and I told him, "sorry, my girl (who walked ahead of me) is carrying it" But he ignored what I said and repeated more aggressively "Sir! Can I have your boarding ticket!". So I went to my seat and grabbed my ticket. He then walks to my seat and went off on me and I told him that she had it. He said he didn't know. Instead of giving the ticket back in a normal way, he threw it and walked away.

### "my entire journey was smooth"
During my trip from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City, my entire journey was smooth. Jetstar offers e-check in kiosk in Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 1 and you can obtain your boarding pass/upgrade yourself at the touch of a button. There are also check in counters available for my use which is very convenient. The crew on board were courteous and polite and it made the entire journey more enjoyable. Good job!

### "journey was a pleasant one"
Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore. Jetstar Asia is one of the better low-cost carrier in the region. Check-in staff were quick and were able to deal with the high volume of customers in Ho Chi Minh City. Within 10 minutes, we were on our way. However, at the airport, we were met with 3 gate changes within the span of an hour. The information provided by the airline on the airport displays were also inaccurate and had confused numerous passengers on this flight. One effort, however, that ought to be noted was how the check-in staff had sauntered through the airport spaces to inform passengers of the gate changes. Boarding, as a result, was late. The crew on the flight, however, were professional. The entire journey on board the aircraft towards Singapore was a pleasant one. Taking into account the fact that Jetstar Asia is a low-cost budget carrier, the level of service provided is acceptable and should be lauded. However, Jetstar can do much more in ensuring that their ground crew are sufficiently trained to deal with the unexpected situations which may arise on the grounds to attempt to alleviate the customers' frustration.

### "Horrible experience"
Osaka to Taipei. Horrible experience flying with Jetstar! The staff is super unprofessional, rude, and most of them can't speak English. Tons of rules to follow that other airline don't have, such as no use of earphones during take off and landing and that you can't stove your luggage under the seat in front of you. Also the only airline I've flown with who demands to see return tickets for the destination! Avoid this company and save yourself from a load of trouble!

### "Think twice about booking Jetstar"
Singapore to Bangkok. I booked a flight for 5 to Bangkok, choose my seats and paid in full. On the day of departure I was informed at the counter the flight was full due to overbooking and I had to take the next flight. Jetstar offered compensation of $150 vouchers for future booking. They will not offer cash vouchers. This is ridiculous as payment has been made in full. Why would I want travel vouchers for another flight with Jetstar? What makes Jetstar think I would want to fly with them in future. Think twice about booking Jetstar.

### "Good budget airline"
Manila to Osaka. Check-in was quick and smooth. We were handed our boarding passes with our pre-assigned max. legroom seats. Our pre-reserved meals were served promptly as soon as the plane reached cruising altitude. My black pepper chicken was hot and tasty. The flight was half full but service was so so. The crew just went about their duties perfunctorily. We enjoyed the lounge access in KIX that came with the fare bundle upgrade. It also came with priority boarding, which was a nice touch. It was pretty much the same story with our return flight after 5 days. Good budget airline. I would fly them again.

### "not recommend this airline"
Singapore to Pekanbaru. Initially the ticket price is cheap. Later they want to make money by charging heavily even for little extra luggage weight. Will not recommend this airline

### "unprofessional way of making money"
At the airport, my hand carry bag was weighed to ensure it was within the maximum allowed 7kg. Since it was within the allowed limit, I was asked to weigh my computer bag as well. Then the total weight exceeded the 7 kg (marginally by 3 kg) and I was made to pay $60. This is a very unprofessional way of making money. It was as if the Jetstar staff were waiting to find an excuse to make me pay extra for something. I will do my best to avoid this airline in the future.

### "asked to pay extra for laptop"
Manila to Singapore. Arrived at Terminal 1 in Manila,  I have a less than 7kg hand carry plus 1 laptop bag with my laptop inside. Weight of hand carry plus laptop (plus charger) is 9kg. Jetstar is the only airline that asked to pay extra for laptop. I asked why in Changi they never asked for extra for laptop. This guy answered in a rude voice and said that he don't care, and he insisted that I pay. Not sure if this should be a review about the terminal staff or the airline but I won't book on this airline again. By the way, I have booked other budget airlines, to and from Manila, like Cebu Pacific and Tigerair (now Scoot) before, and they never asked for laptop bag excess payment. Since there are other choices, better not book Jetstar. Second problem is that their gate in NAIA Terminal 1 need to take stairs and need to open luggage for them to inspect. I'm fine with this but I just went through 2 screenings before going to the boarding gate so not sure what they want to see. I know they want us to be safe and all but it's just too troublesome for all passengers.

### "not worth the hassle"
Denpasar to Singapore. Huge hassle all around. Online check in not working, will not send boarding pass in advance, customer service is awful, unhelpful and unaccommodating. If you want easy and stress-free, choose another airline. The cheap ticket is not worth the hassle. AirAsia is much better, easier, and often cheaper.

### "amazing customer service"
Manila to Singapore. Amazing staff on flight 3K764 Monday 20th August. Late leaving Mania and I was concerned about making my connection in Singapore. Staff contacted Singapore ground staff to find out the gate we would arrive at and where my connection would depart. They also sat me at the front of the plane before landing so I could make leave the aircraft quickly. Thank you for all your help on Monday 20th August, amazing customer service.

### "only has 15kg allowance"
Singapore to Hong Kong. Jetstar Asia wasn’t a friendly airline nor a cheap flight at all! The flight price itself is reasonable but for the first baggage which only has 15kg allowance was very expensive. For whichever that goes over the 15kg, you need to pay $20~$30 per kg. And you have to pay by kg, no other options - they said ‘you pay or you miss your flight!’ I ended up paying $400 in total for the baggage check in. I asked them if i could take out things from my bag because I was two hours early.

### "impressed with the service"
Jieyang to Singapore. My boyfriend and me were on flight 3K 824 on 30 July 2018. We were very impressed with the service rendered by the 4 crew members. It was a full flight with quite a number of infants, toddlers and impatient elderlies, yet the crews displayed an outstanding amount of patience, cheerfulness and an overall great service. It really made a difference to the general atmosphere of the flight. Thank you for a memorable experience. Good job, keep it up !

### "They did not apologize"
Ho Chi Mình City to Da nang. I spent a lot more money to book tickets on this day. Despite of the higher price, we just have only 7kg portable instead of 20kg consignment. After checking in online, I went to get the boarding pass ticket, my family spent over $25 for 15 kilograms on round trip, I carried a 7kg suitcase and a briefcase over 1kg, but that's okay my family does not carry any baggage on the airplane because all their luggage was deposited. At the boarding pass time they checked again my briefcase and it exceeded 7kg so they forced me to pay $25 more with an attitude very unprofessional. They did not apologize and just returned me boarding pass paper to boarded the plane on time. I’m disappointed about the unprofessional attitude of the ground staff from Jetstar.

### "I will choose Jetstar again"
Hong Kong to Kansai. This was my first time to fly with Jetstar from HKG to KIX on 1 July 2018 (flight GK 064) and from KIX to HKG (flight GK 063). I was satisfied with the on-time departures and arrivals. The in-flight services were efficient. Flight attendants were polite and professional. I will choose Jetstar again in the future.

### "extremely pleasant flight"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. It was an extremely pleasant flight. Cabin crew were extremely friendly. They even asked me how my day was. I was charmed by their kindness. Seat width and legroom were good for a low cost airline. The only downside was the cleanliness of the plane as I found an oily paper bag in the seat pocket of my seat. Overall, I would highly recommend Jetstar.

### "money hungry company"
Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City. My first impression is being hassled to spend more money on my carrryon bag because it was 1 kilo over the eight limit. Even after taking my sweater and a scarf and wearing them to make it .02 kilos over “7” they told me it was still To heavy and I’m Not allowed to wear my items? I had to pay 60 Singapore dollars for a tiny backpack that Weighed 7.2 kilos! So disrespectful and money hungry company. To top it off the airplane was extremely dirty. I would never fly this airline again. My carry on in back pack that had one laptop in it and some clothes items and a book was more expensive than my air plane ticket!

### "dissatisfied with this airline"
Kuala Lumpur to Darwin via Singapore. Very dissatisfied with this airline. I first started having issues with them at booking. It wasn't clear in their process that baggage was not included with the price of the flight. So I had to call them to add a bag. Then when I checked in they wouldn't let me carry my guitar on but had to check it and they charged me an extra $100 for that privilege. Then the guy who told me I had to check my guitar told me it was 40 RM per kilo and when I went to go pay the bill it was 50 RM per kilo.

### "flight was quite comfortable"
I flew from Singapore to Jakarta on Jetstar Asia (codeshare with Jet Airways). The flight was quite comfortable for the short flight. The legspace and seat width and support was comfortable. Since it was a codeshare flight, I got a complementary snack and beverage which was sufficient and good for the flight duration.

### "I will choose Jetstar again"
Yangon to Singapore. Very Nice Trip. Flight on time and seat is comfortable Flight attendants are very friendly and very impressed. This is my first time flown with lost cost airlines but they make me very impressed. Starting from the purser to all the cabin crew all are very friendly and they talk very polite and a very comfortable flight. They also remind passengers to notice the time difference between Yangon (Myanmar) and Singapore. Both landing and take off was smooth. I will choose Jetstar again because of them. Wish I will meet them soon on the coming future.

### "A comfortable flight"
Singapore to Yangon. A comfortable flight but crew not friendly. There are 4 cabin crew, 1 purser and 3 (1 male and 2 female) Only one are friendly other 3 including purser are not friendly and they look angry I don't know what wrong with them. Although I greet the Purser when boarding the aircraft she just say hello and no smile and so different form the one I flown from Yangon to Singapore. The only one friendly is so helpful and she explain me kindly about the duty free objects and I requested her for a money exchange she also helped me with that. What a nice crew and very thankful to you for making a great flight. She is very smart can speak 3 languages.

### "The flight was delayed"
Hanoi to Ho Chi-Minh. Terrible airline. The flight was delayed, as always from what I have read earlier. The people at the gate didn't speak english and were just rude when asked questions. Wasn't allowed to bring my carry-on, which I was allowed to bring on my flight here with another airline. However, I have no complaints regarding the seats.

### "I'd rather fly with other airlines"
Singapore to Taipei. Will never fly with Jetstar again no matter how cheap they are. They have staff walking around in the check-in area and stop every traveler and check their carry on luggage. If they exceed 7kg each, prepare to pay $60 (cash only). They strictly enforce this and don't think you can go under their radar. I was flying from Macau 6℃ to Singapore 30℃. So I was wearing those thick and heavy jackets. After spending a few days in Singapore, I packed those few more pounds jackets in the carry on and they forced me to pay $60 to check in the bag. Why cash only? What if people have spent the last cent? I'd rather fly with other airlines even if I need to pay more. Jetstar will lose me forever.

### "an awful experience"
Simple message: avoid Jetstar in Kuala Lumpur at all costs. Everything about their local service is third rate and unacceptable. Came off on an international flight at KLIA2 and wanted to stay outside, but it required a Jetstar transfer desk - non-existent. After clearing customs, went to ticketing to discover no Jetstar office, ticket desk or personnel anywhere in airport. Was told by airport employees they are only available two hours before flight. Check in opened two hours before the flight and there were three agents for 150 passengers. No kiosk check in option, no online check in option guaranteed lengthy queues. Airport personnel are not Jetstar employees - they are all contract employees, who lack knowledge, skills and basic competency. Boarding chaotic as nobody pays attention to instructions. In summary an awful experience which I will not repeat nor recommend.

### "I regret my decision every single time"
Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Never ever fly with Jetstar. Due to connection flight timing I have had to fly Jetstar 6 times within the past 6 months and I regret my decision every single time. Leg room, cramped. Departure, late (6/6 times). Service, sub par. Regardless of price, it is just not worth the headache. It is understandable that an airline's flight is late here and there, but every single time is just absurd. Please, do yourself a favour and never fly with Jetstar Asia.

### "only airline I'm dissatisfied with"
Singapore to Darwin. I've been traveling consistently for more than six months now, and Jetstar is the first and only airline I'm dissatisfied with. It takes a lot for me to get motivated to write an online review, but here we are. I booked a flight online in October for Dec 2, then later tried to move my departure to the previous day. The payment system would not take my edit and payment, and would clear all my credit card input and return me to an empty payment screen. I tried a few times and then gave up. (I found out later this was due to a browser incompatibility issue they have yet to address. Pro tip: Use Safari, not Chrome.) Anyway, when I arrived at the airport last night to check in, I was informed that my flight left a day earlier. When I insisted that was incorrect, the staff (while cordial) basically told me it was my problem because I had definitely made the change online, paid the change fee and received a confirmation. To be fair, that much is true. But how this played out is really bothersome to me. What essentially happened was a booking glitch in the company's UI where I was led to believe that my change was ineffective - when in fact it went through. After checking, I did apparently receive a confirmation email buried way back in an inbox I can seem to only access with some creative filtering. And any kind of extra surcharge for moving would involve me scrutinizing my bank account online daily, something that's simply not realistic for me to do regularly due to my constant travel schedule. So now I'm out the cost of that flight, the cost of an emergency hotel, and the cost of another much more expensive flight. My weekend is pretty much ruined, and much of the next week will be in a rush because I don't have the weekend to regroup. I've contacted the Help Live Chat with this company, and I still get the "it's your problem, you made the changes" line. I've tried contacting them via social media channels and they are only staffed by chatbots. I would love some kind of compensatory gesture - an apology at the very least, but some help with these emergency expenses due to the company's transactional obfuscation online would be better. Poor experience all around. I will not be doing any further booking with Jetstar.

### "I experienced no issues"
Flew Singapore to Denpasar, Bali. After reading some terrible reviews for Jetstar, I was concerned about flying this airline. However, I experienced no issues when I flew with them in October. Check-in was quick and easy. Both flights (including the return journey) left on time. The seat was ok and not uncomfortable and the crew on board were polite. I think it was value for money.

### "I was a bit disappointed"
I booked this return flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur as part of another booking so I didn't choose Jetstar. It is a discount airline with all of their features. The crew were fine and the seat was OK. As my ticket was codeshared, they offered me extra legroom and more luggage allowance. My ticket noted that I was entitled to a lunch. But surprisingly, I was (literally) thrown a muffin and a bottle of water. I was a bit disappointed because if I had booked with a discount airline, I would have expected it.

### "their support did not help us at all"
Jetstar Asia cancelled our flight from Kansai Osaka to Manila due to weather conditions. They made no refund to us, and their support did not help us at all. Only offered a different flight which lasted several days, with multiple transfers. Missed all connecting flights and lost lot of money due to cancellation on their side.

### "customer service is atrocious"
Jetstar's customer service is atrocious if you ever need to cancel a ticket. Last week I bought a ticket for my domestic helper to return for home visit in Dec. She has since changed her mind and doesn't want to return home, but I have not been able to get any help from Jetstar with regard to a refund or travel voucher because I bought a basic economy ticket (almost equivalent in price to a return ticket on a full service flag carrier). Customer service has refused to consider anything, except to say that I bought a non-refundable ticket, so too bad. If I make my helper pay for changing her mind, it would be a month's salary! I have no intention to ever buy another ticket from Jetstar!

### "cheap flights are not worth the hassle"
The cheap flights are not worth the hassle, for my flight from Manila to Singapore, check-in was slow, excess baggage fee of $100, inability to check in online, no customer support and of course the jammed seats. Jetstar Asia is a step down from the Japan counterpart. I recommend paying extra $80 and flying Singapore Airlines or even AirAsia. Last time I fly Jetstar in Asia.

### "consider flying with them again"
Hong Kong to Singapore. Flight was operated by an A320. Boarding time was supposed to start at 7:55pm, but the aircraft didn't even arrive until 8:10pm! Boarding was fast and efficient, although sitting in a window seat meant that I had to squeeze past 2 ladies to reach my seat, and I really do mean squeeze - the seat pitch was very narrow and the seats didn't even recline more than a few degrees, suppose this is the standard for LCCs. Once boarding was finished, we couldn't push back-the pilot told us that due to traffic at Hong Kong airport, our pushback would be delayed! The scheduled departure time was 8:25pm, but combining the late arrival of the aircraft and the heavy traffic, we didn't even take-off until 9:37pm. In the end, we arrived in Singapore at 1AM, 1 hour behind scheduled. There was no wi-fi or entertainment offered on board. The saving grace of this flight was the cabin service. During boarding, the cabin service was dismal - they didn't even greet the passengers and generally didn't feel very warm. However, after take-off, they did improve their quality of service a lot-very responsive, every request was attended to quickly. After landing, they also apologized for the delay and the "inconvenience resulted to passengers". All in all, although the seat was really cramped and the flight was delayed by 1 hour, the saving grace was still the cabin service, and given the price, I might consider flying with them again.

### "didn't get any drink"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. In the beginning, I thought the cabin crew were doing a good job because they persisted to get passengers' attention during safety instructions. However I called the crew 3 times to get a mineral bottle, and didn't get any drink because it was too late. They said that the plane was going to land soon. It was just a short trip and the cabin crew just couldn't act faster. I was thirsty and ready to pay $4 for a Dasani bottle.

### "Will never fly Jetstar again"
Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. The flight was due to take off at 21.00 but didn't take off until 23.00. The aircraft turned out to be leased by Vueling with an all-Spanish crew (plus one token Vietnamese flight attendant). There was no apology whatsoever from the crew about the 2hr delay. They seemed completely oblivious to this fact. Throughout the whole flight there were no announcements from the flight deck. It's as if they assumed no one would understand their English. When the paid food trolley came round there were no sandwiches available as displayed on the menu. Again no apology from the crew. Overall it was an awful service. Will never fly Jetstar again! !

### "airline delaying so frequently"
Jakarta to Singapore. I am a frequent flyer for business, flying at least 3-4 times a month with various airlines in the region. I have never known an airline delaying so frequently and are unapologetic about it. This is the second time in 8 months and I have only taken less than 5 flights with them during this period. Seems like it is a norm for them, flight from Bangkok (cancelled) and and 4.5 hours in Jakarta to Singapore. Jetstar ought to be in the 'delay' business. After their catastrophe, you would expect a ground Manager to make decisions and attend to your queries. However, they left junior staff on the ground to deal with the situation on both occasions. If you want to make sure you are able to travel on the time and date you want, do not fly Jetstar unless you like to sit around the airport or enjoy having your flights cancelled or overbooked.

### "broke emergency regulations"
Singapore to Jakarta. First and last experience, would not get on another Jetstar Asia flight if you paid me, they broke emergency regulations and had nobody over 16 years old to open an exit sat at any of the overwing exits. I confronted the cabin manager who was rude, didn't let me speak, pointed in my face and told me that AirAsia and TigerAir do stuff like this? I told her my point was that an A320 is an A320 it shouldn't matter where in the world you are, the safety regulations are there for a reason. When I spoke to customer services they were the most unhelpful you could expect from a customer service experience imaginable.

### "seats do not recline much"
I've flown Jetstar between Singapore and Bangkok four times in 2 months. The flights were on time and the cabin crew efficient. The announcements can be unclear at times and hard to make out what's being said. The seats do not recline much so it can be a little unbearable depending on how rested you are. The gates for the flights from Bangkok tend to be quite a long walk away from the immigration clearance area so you need to set aside sufficient time for the walk there comfortably.

### "a disappointing experience"
Flew on 3K664 from Kuala Lumpur back to Singapore with Jetstar Asia. I purchased this ticket for its cheap price, but I think I made a big mistake. I can say that this airline has entered my avoid list. It is so much worse than AirAsia which I have always flown and relied on, and I think even Tigerair is more enjoyable on this short flight. The boarding process was extremely chaotic and unorganized. The cabin and windows were extremely dirty, I can imagine the cabin will look very dull if it is a night flight. All the onboard refreshments are overpriced and the cabin crews always advertising the different services. I will never fly with Jetstar Asia again after such a disappointing experience.

### "seats are cramped"
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur with Jetstar Asia. The flight was very disappointing, the cabin crew did not greet passengers when boarding. Aircraft was extremely dirty including the windows. The seats are cramped that I can't even stretch my leg, luckily it was just a short 45 minutes flight.

### "felt like sitting on a stool"
Flew Jetstar Asia from Singapore to Osaka via Taipei. The ground staff and flight crews are excellent. But the seats are really economy sized. They are 2/3 length of the seats of other airlines. I had to sit up right to keep from sliding off, which made it difficult to rest for an overnight flight. I am under 5ft tall, so I can't imagine a taller person sitting on it with any comforts. It felt like sitting on a stool.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Osaka to Manila with Jetstar Asia - I have to admit that I was quite sceptical about flying Jetstar for the first time. Self Check-in at Kansai Airport went smoothly, so did bag drop. It was nothing out of the ordinary for what I would expect from a Low Cost Carrier. I was actually pleasantly surprised by how well everything was because of the bad rep that this airline supposedly has.

### "clean comfortable cabin"
Ho Ci Minh City to Darwin via Singapore with Jetstar Asia. All 4 flights took off on time. Clean comfortable cabin with enough legroom. Polite service. Totally unlike Jetstar Pacific which should not be allowed the same name - would use them again for cheap prices.

### "customer service terrible"
My wife and I traveled to Phuket in September 2015. After travelling for over 24 hours we arrived in Singapore to find that Jetstar Asia had cancelled our flight from Singapore to Phuket for no apparent reason. We had to purchase new tickets at more than double the original cost. After returning home we have been trying to get refunds for these flights that we paid for twice. Jetstar Asia has largely ignored our requests for months now. Their customer service has been absolutely terrible and I would recommend that you avoid using this airline.

### "FA's were friendly"
Singapore to Bangkok with Jetstar Asia. Quick boarding at Changi Airport Singapore without delay. Outside snacks/food was allowed (in contrary to other budget airlines) which is good. Flight touched down 15 minutes before schedule. Disembarkation very quick. FA's were friendly if you needed them. They also provided the Thailand Arrival Form for foreigners. Seat was good for a short trip. Ground service could be better; no one helped us during check-in and baggage drop-off at Changi Airport. The queue for clearing immigration was very long at the airport. Once the immigration officers checked our travel documents, we were told that we need a document check-stamp from the Jetstar counter. So we went back to the check-in counter to get the stamp.

### "uncomfortable and cramped"
It was a torturous 45 minute flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore onboard Jetstar Asia, I did not get the seat I wanted because the flight was full so they had to put me in the last row of the aircraft. The cabin had an unpleasant smell which really irritated my nose and the seat was extremely uncomfortable and cramped. I could barely move my legs and sitting in the last row also meant that my seat could not be reclined. The flight attendants barely communicated with the passengers as it was just a short flight. Fortunately, the flight landed at Singapore Changi Airport on time and there were no delays but I will not fly with Jetstar Asia again in future after this horrible experience on such a short flight.

### "typical budget airline flight"
Jetstar is perhaps my least favorite among other low cost airlines operating in Singapore but they offered a good option to fly from Osaka to Singapore via Manila, so we make the booking. Fast and efficient check-in - Japanese style in Osaka airport, 4 hours of flight to Manila and then another 3 or so to Singapore. Nothing special, typical budget airline flight, no entertainment system, food-to-buy, drinks-to-buy. But compared to the low fare it was just good enough. Basically, it's better to book them on shorter flights.

### "avoid row 17 if possible"
On our return Jetstar Asia flight from Siem Reap we were seated in row 17. The row was extremely narrow, more so than row 16 which we sat in on our flight up to Siem Reap. My husband moved to a row near the back of the plane and he said there was more room there. Avoid row 17 if possible.

### "lack of care or courtesy"
Manila to Singapore return. As a disabled passenger who requires wheelchair assistance to the cabin door, I was shocked at the lack of care or courtesy from the JetStar ground crew. The airport staff in Manila took very good care of me through ticketing and to the gate but then I was left to the uncaring JetStar staff at the gate and in the air. Singapore was even worse as the airport staff leaves me in the uncaring hands to JetStar at the ticket counter, who told me they could not provide any assistance to the gate until 45 minutes before boarding. After paying a young airport staff member a few dollars he got me out to the gate. The cabin staff from Singapore was even worse than the ground crew as they spent most of the flight hidden behind the curtain laughing. I was shocked at the unprofessionalism and uncaring of the entire JetStar team.

### "value for money"
Singapore to Bali with Jetstar Asia. A value for money flight. Checking in was easy and staff helpful. The website and booking was quick and easy which is all we can ask. Seats a bit tight for tall males but ok for the flight duration but staff were good, friendly and helpful. I would use them again

### "never fly this airline again"
Ho Chi Minh to Hong Kong via Singapore. This is the first time I flew with Jetstar Asia. I was told that tripods were not allowed as carryon luggage. The staff at the counter refused to point to any writing saying that tripods were not allowed. As well, the girl I was trying to get information from regarding this issue treated me very rudely when I was speaking to her kindly. I was flabbergasted by how rude she was and refused to answer any of my questions. I have flown in Vietnam before with my tripod as my carryon and have had no problems. The cost of checked baggage by this airline is exorbitant. For a 1.5kg tripod, the staff quoted me $40 USD! I will never fly this airline again.

### "good value for money"
Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City on Jetstar Asia. Cheap fares, seats were new, Crew efficient and was friendly. Possibility to book single services (checkin-lugagge/reserve a seat/meals etc.) is a nice option. Self check-in in Singapore worked well after we understood how to use it. Legroom was limited, but usual for LCC. Seatwidth was okay. All in all a good value for money.

### "Crew was friendly"
Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore, Cheap fares, the Jetstar Asia booking process is comfortable. Booked 5KG of extra bagagge just 2 hours before check-in online and this was also very cheap. Crew was friendly. Legroom is a bit small, as typical by LCC. Plane was quite used. Leather of the seats was nearly wrecked. Had a little delay. In Ho Chi Minh City there were just 2 counters for a mass of people. We had to wait nearly an hour.

### "massively uncomfortable flight"
Jetstar Asia from Bangkok to Melbourne via Singapore. I sat in seat 23G, paying extra to sit in the aisle seat in a row beside the door for extra legroom. I would not fly Jetstar again, though. The toilets on the plane are filthy, with grot accumulating on the floors and surfaces below waist height. There aren't enough toilets, so there was constantly a queue, and this was disturbing to passengers nearby. The food service is really weird - I missed out on breakfast because I didn't hear any announcement it was available. And even though I'd paid for extra legroom, it was still a massively uncomfortable flight, because the armrests are hard and narrow and I was sitting next to someone equally broad-shouldered. Every time the cabin crew walked past, they smacked into my shoulder, so I got no sleep.

### "paid for services we wanted"
My wife and I have flown Jetstar between Jakarta and Perth from their first flight some 8 years ago. We chose Jetstar because it was a direct flight (4.5 hours) and cheapest compared to any other flight. I always booked online, paid for the meals we wanted, paid for the seats we wanted and once bought their comfort pack, and bought the luggage we wanted; and the all up price was still cheaper than others. Because we paid for the services we wanted we always sat with the first 7 rows and had our meals served first. My wife and I are friendly to the cabin crew and we never have a bad time - sure sometimes the crew are brand new and learning but half an ounce of patience is all it takes. But each time I lodge a civilised complaint and receive a favourable result. I will say that Jetstar only issue discount vouchers for future flights, which suited us because we fly so often. Must admit nowadays because Jetstar flies via Singapore, our flights have gone from 4.5 hours to 10.5-13.5 hours so we now look for more alternatives. We can fly Garuda direct flight (4.5 hours) for a very competitive price to Jetstar, but if you are price conscious Jetstar may still be cheaper than Garuda, we just prefer the shorter flight time.

### "value for money"
Short flight from Medan to Singapore. Even though it is a budget airline, Jetstar Asia is better than some European airlines. The plane was spotless and comfortable for short flight. The check-in and boarding process were efficient and flight attendants courteous. The meal options for purchase was limited but enough for 1 hour flight. As long as you remember that this is a no frill airline, Jetstar offer great value for money.

### "disappointed with Jetstar"
So disappointed with Jetstar. Booked flight Jetstar Asia from Singapore to Surabaya from 12PM flight.We were in the Changi airport around 10AM and received late notification that the flight would be delayed. We waited in Changi airport without clear information till around 2PM,the staff told us the flight delayed till 3PM. And we waited till 3PM then Jetstar staff announced that the flight cancelled due to volcanic activity. We checked on the website and there is no annoucement from Surabaya Authority that there was volcanic activity and at the end we had to find another flight with different airline on that night and of course with higher cost since it was last minute booking. Similar case happened when we wanted to return to Singapore from Surabaya, since we have booked return ticket with Jetstar. Last minute they sent message that flight delay and later they cancelled it.

### "still not received refund"
I flew with jetstar 6 times in a month in total and the flights are fine for a budget airline. However I will not be flying with them again. I had a flight booked from Hong Kong to hanoi on the first of November. This was cancelled within a weeks notice. As I could not make the alternative flight the offered me I asked for a refund as there where no viable alternatives. It is now 2 months after the refund was asked for and I still have not received it despite contacting them on 8 separate occasions now. It was meant to take 15 days at the most. I have been told this numerous times now. I had another flight on the 13th of November which they charged me twice for. I went to see someone and they told me the company had realised the mistake and was processing the refund. It will take 15 days. I still have not received it.

### "cabin was clean and new"
Flew Jetstar Asia on flight 3K592 from Phnom Penh back to Singapore. Flight was on time, cabin was clean and new, and the seat was comfortable. Even though it was a night flight, passengers still can purchase their food and drinks. The onboard meal was tasty and the cabin crews served with a smile. Jetstar is my favorite budget airline.

### "favorite budget airline"
Flew Jetstar Asia from Singapore to Phnom Penh on 24 November. The cabin was new and clean. Seat was comfortable and legroom was adequate. Varities of food and drinks were available for purchase. The cabin crew were very helpful. Jetstar Asia is my favorite budget airline.

### "changed without notification"
Was happy to see that Jetstar Asia accepted online check in 48 hours in advance only to be horrified to find out when attempting to check in that both my outward and return flight times had been changed without any notification. This meant making changes to booked airport transfers and hotel arrangements. I bought this to Jetstar's customer services attention and a few days later they authorised a voucher to be used against a future booking for less than £3!

### "flight was cancelled "
Jetstar Asia was extremely bad. Flight was cancelled due to volcano while every other airline was still flying to Singapore except Jetstar. There was only 1 person at the airport from Jetstar. The option they gave was to book another ticket from an other airline and we could get our money back at Singapore? The site was good for making a booking.

### "they're really ok to fly with"
I'm a regular traveler on business class with most major airlines. This was my first time flying with Jetstar Asia, as well as with budget airlines. Overall the experience was pleasant. Given that I already set my expectation to the lowest. They more than delivered a decent experience for the money paid. This review is written without bias or unfair comparison to business class. The check in queue is rather long. I'd say give at least 30 to 45 minutes time to allow check in. I paid extra and booked exit row seat 1K, very much worth the little extra money paid for comfort, also first to get off the plane to immigration. Except that because of extra safety concern, passengers who booked these seats must not check on online, thus the long queuing process. A small inconvenience but understandable. Boarding is orderly although not by row. We took the bus to board the plane in orderly fashion. 4 crew members dressed in their smart simple uniform did their best to handle a full flight. I find them polite and efficient. My flight which is booked with max bundle came with a free meal and drink. Although small in quantity and didn't look too impressive, the taste however was surprisingly good. Free drink was either a hot coffee or tea plus a bottle of water. For me that's sufficient. There's no entertainment on the plane. The free magazine was enjoyable to read, plus listening to music on my ipod and a book I brought along to read. 3 hours went by easily. A good selection of duty free products were also on offer. Luggage delivery however, was rather slow. My bag plus many others didn't come until a good 40 minutes later. At least it's not lost or damaged. The overall experience waa fine. I think if they offer great discounts, it can be a good alternative. However if you are more used to traditional full airlines service, they may fall short. Then again, they never pretend to be a full service airlines in the first place. Settle your worries, they're really ok to fly with.

### "a very good experience"
Flying from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore, flew with Qantas to Singapore, and then Jetstar Asia to KL. Check in at MEL with bags booked through to destination and boarding passes for the Jetstar flight issued. A pleasant two hours in the Singapore Qantas lounge then our flight to KL. Quick boarding, we were asked to board first, I guess this was due to the fact that we were on a full fare, seated in row 1 (pre assigned at booking). Aircraft clean, very pleasant crew who were quite chatty. A very quick flight we were offered a sandwich snack (very tasty) juices, and water. This was more than offered on Malaysia Airlines on this route. Arrived on time, bags quickly at the belt. All in all a very good experience, seating is tight but this is a low cost airline, but for such a quick flight this seamless trip with a good number of frequent flyer points earned it was excellent.

### "I would recommend this airline"
I saw a lot of negatives. You pay cheap you get cheap. I have taken Jetstar thrice, 2 times to Thailand and ones to Kuala Lumpur. I hadn't had an issue with the level of service or competency of the crew. The meals you have to purchase if you take the lowest fare, during your purchase, they will give you options to add food and drinks, luggage allowances etc. I made a mistake the first time because unlike many budget carriers, Jetstar do not provide free luggage allowances, you have to purchase them. Lucky for me, the customer service staff were kind enough to help me through the process. Seats comfort were alright, leg room was an issue, but wasn't a big deal for me honestly because my flight was just merely 3 hours and I paid cheap so I got cheap. I would recommend my friends to this airline.

### "never mistake it for a full service airline"
Check your booking carefully before purchasing the ticket with Jetstar Asia! I booked the "plus bundle" on this flight, which is worth the extra cost but wasn't easy to get - every time I selected it, the Jetstar website moved me to completely different flights with an overnight gap in between - no thanks! This isn't the first time I have had problems with the Jetstar website, fortunately after repeated complaints the online chat person sorted it out for me. The flights were on time, onboard service was fine, and the "plus bundle" gave me plenty to eat and drink. Some of the seats are very tight, I stumped up the $30 extra for an exit seat on the long sector, and for the second sector I knew which standard seats to select to be sure of 29" pitch. You would never mistake it for a full service airline experience but it did the job.

### "the worst customer service"
It was my first time flying this budget airline, Jetstar Asia. I was traveling with family. First off, it took the ticket counter rep forever to find my reservation. She didn't seem to think it's her job but mine to give her the full details of my itinerary. Second, we were struggling to meet the baggage weight restrictions. So we decided to check in one extra luggage the very last minute. Although it is a complete oversight on our end, the Jetstar rep did not bother to help us in any way. They have the worst customer service ever. I will take my business elsewhere after what I experienced with Jetstar Asia.

### "acceptable for price you pay"
Flew Jetstar Asia from Singapore to Phuket for a short holiday in April. Arrived at the baggage drop-off counter/ check-in exactly 45 minutes before departure. I already did online check-in. Their policy is 40 minutes before scheduled departure time you can drop-off your baggage. They refused to do baggage drop-off. After a discussion, they finally let us drop off the baggage. I find it strange. Jetstar staff were pretty rude during the discussion. Consistency in their policy? Seats was very small, hardly any leg space. However, for a short flight and the price you pay it is acceptable. Cabin crew did their job, not more and not less. Overall experience at the airport very bad. Onboard the flight was okay. For the price I would recommend this airline - for the service I would not recommend Jetstar Asia.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew this airline from KUL to SIN on July 1st and SIN to KUL July 5th. Overall, everything was as expected. You don't get anything (food, drink, pillow, IFE) but the price is very good and it's the cheapest airline if you want 25kg of luggage. So for a 1 hour flight, I was satisfied. First flight was on time but my return flight was delayed about 45 minutes because of two drunk passengers who were escorted out of the plane by the police.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
This is a budget airline at Champagne prices. A late booking meant all of the quality airlines were full, and had no option but Jetstar. The only thing cheap about this airline is its service and customer care. Book early enough and you'll get a reputable airline that does not charge you for blankets, pillows, entertainment, food, drinks, newspapers, luggage - the list goes on. What's more you will get check-in staff who want to help and stewardesses that smile and actually want to assist you.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
The flight was delayed 10 hours due to some problem in Tokyo but my flight was to Taipei! The ground staff didn't give me any offer, just treated me with a sour face. Seat was very uncomfortable if you're flying over 3 hours. I will never choose Jetstar Asia any more.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew from Changi to Jakarta with a special livery "Asia's Got Talent" A320. Everything from Singapore to Jakarta was nice except for the liveries they surely need an upgrade especially the cabin - but the rest was okay.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew from JKT to Changi with an A320. A little disappointed with the airport and airline staff who didn't tell us of gate changes after we moved to the new gate it changed again and again with no announcement. Luckily in Soekarno Hatta airport the gates are nearby each other so it was ok. The plane was good for a low-cost carrier only a little damage to the table. I recommend Jetstar Asia if you want a cheap and efficient trip.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew from Sydney-Cairns-Tokyo and returned back in the same way during January 2015. It was enormously frustrating for me and the other majority of the plane that Jetstar ran out of international arrival cards on both legs in and out of Japan. If Jetstar cannot get this right then what other standard procedures are being overlooked? Checking out and back in is also very frustrating ie having to push your bags 10 minutes in high humidity between the separated domestic and international airports. Cairns International airport is also very slow in administering arrivals.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
I used Jetstar to fly from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam. The staff were very nice and accommodating the plane looked new and was comfortable. However the flight was delayed 6 hours and we were notified about 2 hours before going to the airport. The telephone number in the notification did not exist. Lucky for us we could change to an earlier flight on the airport but it's definitely not worth the extra stress! I heard Jetstar is almost always delayed in Vietnam. I would pay more for a more reliable airline.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
JetStar Asia provided no service or assistance after technical problem. Flight from Bangkok to Singapore and the plane had to return to Bangkok due to technical problems. JetStar announced a 2-hour repair time and then left passengers for 3 hours in a gate without any information services not to mention snacks or water. After 3 hours they suddenly announced the flight was cancelled and wanted to transfer all passengers to a nearby hotel and re- book on a flight the next day. JetStar could not book customers on to other airlines. The staff were not authorized to take any further action they claimed there is no JetStar office in Bangkok we were given a call centre number in Australia which we should call (at our cost) and which could not help much either. No complaint about the fact that there is a technical problem but the way they care about their passengers is simply ridiculous. Never again JetStar.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew from Perth to Singapore and back. First time using this airlines. The stand out performance was from the cabin crew and pilots. The cabin crew were courteous efficient and accommodating. Although this is a no frills airline the crew attitude manner and sincerity are clearly superior to some other airlines which I have often flown (e.g. Singapore Airlines). Flights were on time.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
JetStar first and last flight with this Airline! We were booked to fly to Singapore on October 1 in the early morning we were to arrive in early afternoon leaving the us rest of the day. We were notified at 6 am that we now would be delayed and not arrive in Singapore until 9 pm so thank you Jet Star for ruining our day. Flight back with Tiger from Singapore to Perth was much cheaper and arrived early. I know JetStar will blow me off as just one disgruntled passenger who wont fly with them again but I heard a few others on the same flight who echoed my promise to pick another carrier in future I think in today's highly competitive airline industry if JetStar continues to shed passengers by constantly delaying flights they wont be around to repeat the mistakes for too much longer.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew Perth to Singapore on Jetstar. Paid for front row exit seats at $30 each. The seats were hard as rock and completely unsuitable for a 5.5 hr flight. I am glad we were in front row so we could stretch out our legs. It would have been horrible squeezes into the seats behind. Cabin crew lovely. When will Qantas start flying this route again?

### Jetstar Asia customer review
No problems at all with them flying SIN-SGN SGN-HAN and return. Staff were lovely smiling and helpful. Notified by email of any flight changes along the way.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
JQ117 SIN-DPS 8 May. Even though I had done web check-in online and queued at the Web Check-in counter at Changi airport I was directed to other queue line after waiting for 10 minutes. They could have told me earlier. The flight was slightly delayed but arrived on time in Bali. The FA was polite nothing to complaint about. I didn't order the food. The ticket price was the lowest among the same type of carriers at around the same departure time.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew from Perth - Singapore - Saigon and return. Noisiest plane ever encountered on first flight. Seat pitch inadequate for flight of 5.5 hours. Real problem service on return flight. Was supposed to have assistance for elderly mother. Got rude unpleasant woman who simply walked off. Could not believe how rude she was. Will never use Jetstar again!

### Jetstar Asia customer review
3K 677 SIN-PEN 25 Feb and 3K 678 PEN-SIN 27 Feb. Flight departing Singapore was barely 1/3 full - a couple of passengers moved away from their assigned seat and had a whole row to themselves. Crew looked extremely tired - could see cup lid lying on the floor and various pieces of litter. Seat was pretty ok - good for a 1 hour flight but probably not recommended for anything more than 3 hours and above. Flight arrived in Penang 20 minutes early doors were quickly opened but it was evident the cabin crew were halfway to dreamland as no one was at the exit to wish passengers a pleasant journey. Flight back to Singapore on 27 Feb was slightly better though curiously gate agents at Penang Airport preferred to shout out instructions to passengers instead of using a PA system. Flight was 2/3 full and departed on time from Penang. Same seats and usual food and duty free sales service as inbound flight to Penang. Arrival at Changi at 11.40am and swift disembarkation from aircraft - this time a crew member was at the exit to say a simple "bye". Overall the fare I paid was value for money especially at the last minute but it is clear to me that Jetstar Asia needs to severely improve for its customers especially when Qantas is going to rely more on them in future for intra-Asia connections and the sole direct from Singapore to Western Australia - clearly something needs to be done in the area of service quality.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
3K686 9V-JSI KUL (gate C31)-SIN (gate D38) on 14/2/14. It was a full flight and was allocated to seat 28A. 5 FA (4 of them were male) serving for this 38 minutes (1432-1510) short flight. We landed in SIN 35 minutes early. All smooth and FA's were very friendly but the legroom was exhausting.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew from Phuket to Singapore. Long slow moving queue at check in. Exorbitant baggage tariffs. Extremely rude manager at check in counter who needs a few lessons in customer service but this seems common in Phuket these days. Have never flown Jetstar before and flew this time as the flight time suited me. After this experience I will avoid Jetstar in future wherever possible!

### Jetstar Asia customer review
TPE-KIX  easy check-in friendly staff on time flight. I was especially glad to discover that they were quite flexible regarding carry-on luggage (mine was slightly larger than the accepted standard but I saw a family carrying at least 3 times each on board) probably due to a less than full flight but still a good surprise for a low-cost airline.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew Jetstar Asia on a short return flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. First of all the booking for the flight has a lot of fees even though my fare was a $0 fare. The most unbearable part of the booking is that we have to pay a $17 Per person credit card processing fee. I was assigned to seat 10K when I was doing online check- in. I booked this Jetstar flight as it was the only airline operating from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur while landing at the KLIA Main Terminal. Not many complains for this short flight but the cafe menu was quite a rip off but it's a budget airline. Overall quite a good trip on Jetstar and I would rather travel on this budget airline on my future trips if I have to.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Gone are the days of good service. They say a smile does cost anything but not once did I see the cabin crew smile. Quite the opposite the were right down rude. Asked to borrow pen got a dirty look then the hostess said she'll get it later but of course never did. Treated other passengers pretty bad as well. The food was awful.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
We recently travelled to Vietnam using Scoot Airlines Tiger Airways and Jet Star and Jet Star were by far the worse airline we have travelled with. Both of our afternoon flights were cancelled leaving us with 3 children and 5 hour delays at the airports. If you have children never book with Jet Star its bad enough being delayed as an adult but try it with 3 young boys especially when it happens twice in a week. Never again.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
KIX-SIN via TPE. The check in was rather smooth but the flight itself was not very good. staff was rather rude when asked any question and the food and drinks were quite expensive. Furthermore the layover at Taipei was rather chaotic. I would say there are definitely better options in the same price range and therefore I would not recommend flying with Jetstar.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
KUL-SIN. Reasonable flight. Pay S$4 for drinks. Flights from T1 Changi and KLIA good for transfers to other airlines.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew Jetstar Asia from HKG to SIN for a low cost airline company very good service nice clean plane and a very friendly staff.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-BKK-SIN. Paid extra for FF points and meal. The meals going up were of acceptable quality but coming back they were diabolical. The seats themselves are fairly comfy but because the rows are so incredibly close it meant I was not able to put my knees in front of me and had to sit splayed legged. This resulted in a sore back and aching hips. Luckily a fairly short flight. Not sure what it is about Jestar crew they're efficient but never particularly friendly. Often they look quite depressed. If only they'd smile and be a bit more welcoming. We also struggled to understand the heavy Singaporean English accent of the Cabin Manager when she made announcements.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-HKT. Check in done online baggage drop nice and quick. Aircraft A320 in good condition leather seats ok not much leg room but for flights around 2-3 hours should not be a problem. Buy on board service was efficient and reasonably priced. If the price was right would not hesitate to fly with them again.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
We were near rear of the queue at the check in for Flight 3K556 from Saigon to Singapore before the counter opened 2 hrs before the flight. Service was painfully slow and we got checked within 1 minute of the 40min cut off time. Immigration and security delays got us to gate with only 1 minute to spare. If anyone missed the gate cut off it would have been down to Jetstar's own slow service but to be fair do not know whether any of the many behind us were knocked back or not. Seat pitch is way too small for any flights of 1 hour or more in fact quite painful. I noticed most passengers accepted this shortcoming and did not recline their seat - except the one in front of me!

### Jetstar Asia customer review
BL593 from Da Nang to Saigon was cancelled with no warning or explanation. Put on a (5 hrs) later flight. Staff quite rude. Gave us a meal voucher which was refused at all food outlets in the airport except one grubby cafe who supplied a 'special menu' for voucher holders! Legroom felt like the smallest I have experienced to date - very uncomfortable. Due to poor reputation Jetstar is not my airline of choice but chose purely on convenience of flight time which does not appear to be 'regular' and wonder whether it was listed and when not fully subscribed simply bundled into the later regular flight?

Flew Hanoi-SIN on A320. Leather seats were ok but leg space is really tight. Seat recline - as good as no recline. Though this is a budget carrier more could be done with the seats. Seats pale in comparison with other budget carries I have flown. Cabin crew attentive and service was prompt. Plane was overall in a good condition. Air con was regulated such that we didn't have to purchase the blankets. One should consider full service carriers for any flight more than 4 hours especially if you are tall.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew TPE-SIN aircraft was an A320 that was recently delivered in October this year. Seats are comfortable although leg room is very small. Recline was also barely noticeable. Service by the staff are also excellent and toilets were kept very clean throughout the entire flight. Would recommend for short-medium haul flights but might reconsider for flights longer than 5 hours.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
PNH to SIN. The aircraft was clean. Flight was on time. Very little leg room. OK for this flight (

Flight from Phnom Penh to Singapore on time on spotlessly clean aircraft with friendly and efficient staff.

We had a nearly 3-hour delay on 10 Nov on our SIN-DPS flight (VF241). We were told that the computerised check-in system was down. At the start of the delay there were confusion on what to do and the communication to the passengers affected was poorly managed. At times there were discrepancy between the instruction by Jetstar Asia and Changi Airport's staffs. We were originally in the "web-check in" queue since we had checked in online but was redirected to a long queue specifically for our flight afterwards. Apparently the web check in queue was functioning soon after we left out queue to join a super long queue. To make things worse at the boarding gate we were told that our seats (which we paid for) has been taken by others! My wife and I have to either sit separately staff did not even bother to ask the passengers whether they were open to a switch? In short the delay was badly managed.

SIN-SGN rtn. My cabin bag was overweight by 3 kgs so I paid the excess SGD60 and then they insisted I check the bag in at the gate. Left the bag with staff at gate who assured me it would be loaded. It wasn't. Agent in SGN was less than helpful and asked me three times if I was sure my bag hadn't been taken off the carousel and left beside it. 24 hrs and three phone calls later I was informed the bag had arrived and I needed to travel to the airport to collect it as they would not deliver it to the hotel despite it being their fault. All up SGD 60 for the honour of them losing my bag and then taxi fares of USD30 to get to and from the airport to collect the bag. Didn't mind being charged the excess but the loss of the bag and the refusal to deliver was just too ridiculous. Flight was good but the baggage issues ruined my trip.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Flew from SIN-BKK-SIN. The flight to BKK was fun and seat was still acceptable as it was just a 2 hours flight but the return flight to SIN was torture! The leather seat was so hard and uncomfortable and the air conditioning was not in good condition.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
CGK-SIN-CGK. One flight with lots of overweight both on check-in and hand luggage (on hand luggage 7 Kg more than allowed my flying partner 11Kg more than allowed!) but no problems with the check-in crew. The staff were nice. I can't understand why the airlines doesn't announce when did you crossed the Equator. Otherwise everything great. I will fly JetStar again.

Ho Chi Minh City - Singapore. Everything as expected or even a bit better. Never had a delay with JetStar. No issues comfortable seats.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Hong Kong - Singapore - Perth. We flew from HKG to Singapore originally at 11.05am and should have taken the second flight to Perth at 5.50pm. Jetstar delayed the flight for 7 hours due to 'adverse weather and operational reason'. Flights of other airlines had the planes boarded to Singapore with at most 1 hour delay. We finally could not catch up the second plane and were forced to stay one night in Singapore with no accommodation provided. Staff were not helpful and made us confused. We arrived Perth with a 24-hour delay with no luggage. We called the so-called 'hotlines' and the people there said they are not the customer service department staff and we could only complain by email. Finally we were back to Hong Kong and sent an email to Jetstar.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Singapore - Medan - Singapore. Online check-in option made checking in easier. However ground staff insisted that my hand carry be weighed. Exceeded boarding allowance by 4kg. They were every insistent that I pay for every single kilogram exceeded (they even threatened that Jetstar will re-weigh your luggage inside). I was shocked by this as this was the first time I encountered this. Staff took back my boarding pass and refused to let me enter unless I paid SGD80. I was able to negotiate with a more senior ground crew who eventually halved my fees. Although this is a budget carrier their policies come across as desperate rigid and unlike Asian carriers. This experience left a bitter taste in my mouth as it seems they are using every opportunity to make money from you. For future customers I would advice choosing an alternative carrier. I hope this serves as a warning to future customers.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Singapore-Jakarta-Singapore. Smooth check in flight was on time seats were okay. It was a short flight so it wasn't too bad. I thought it was a bit too hectic when they were selling food. Did not have a bad experience like I normally had when travelling with other budget airlines.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
KIX-SIN-KIX then KIX-SIN both via TPE. Jetstar was cheaper by at least 20% than all other airlines on this leg excluding the other budget carrier but the timings (midday departure from Japan red-eye return) were better for me. Check in lines were long but the internet check in line was empty. In Japan when I mentioned that I tried to check in online but was unable to they put me into the internet check in line without delay which impressed me. Boarding was prompt and service very nice onboard; the FA proactively suggested I move to a roomier seat when the plane was emptier. Onboard food and drink are very expensive but we could bring on what we needed and with the stop in Taipei you're able to have an affordable lunch. Would definitely fly again as long as the price stays low.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Jakarta-Singapore-Jakarta. Slightly delayed but it wasn't a big problem cabin crews were pretty friendly and welcoming when we boarded the aircraft but seemed to be ignorant when we were about to get off the aircraft. One passenger's mobile phone went off when the plane was about to take off and cabin crew made an announcement to remind passengers to switch their mobile phones off at all times straight away. Overall it was good especially for a budget airline you were also allocated to a seat once you've checked in unlike budget airlines in Europe where you have to run for it.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
KUL-Singapore in seat 6A. Ok for the short flight although leg room quite limited. Cabin was clean and bright. Late arrival from its previous journey caused a delay to this flight but fortunately my onward connection to Perth was not affected. The short hops are satisfactory but I still miss that extra leg room on longer international flights as well as not having to purchase everything including water which I had to on this one.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
BKK-SIN on a full A320. Check-in about 20 minutes not bad for Jetstar most importantly on time despite a full plane. All this for much less than the full service carriers. No frills but you get where you are going efficiently and this is all I want.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-KUL return. Flights were pleasant and cabin crew service satisfactory. Cabin on the flight back was newer. Wished they created more leg room on the A320 as the seat in front touches the knees of many passengers which made it uncomfortable. Liked the fact that although fares are mostly lower than their rival low cost carriers they depart and arrive at the main international terminals in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur and not their budget terminals. Will recommend Jetstar for their price and condition of their fleet and will continue to fly with them as long as their prices are kept low.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
BKK-SIN return. Check-in at BKK easy with no queue A320 75% full. Very tight seat pitch. Seat has no recline. Long 30 mins check-in queue at Changi Terminal 1 at 5.30 am. Plane new and clean. You have to pay for everything so you get what you pay for.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
MNL-SIN-KUL return. As with other low cost carriers they don't have any food or refreshments and you have to pay for check-in luggage. Their carry-on baggage allowance was generous at 10 kg though. Didn't buy the food they sold onboard as they were quite pricey. I was surprised that the seats on the MNL-SIN flight did not recline. I liked the fact that they use the Terminal 1 of Changhi Airport and not the Budget Terminal. SIN-KUL seats can recline but they're not made of leather like the MNL-SIN seats. They use the Satellite Terminal of KLIA and not the LCCT. Still good value considering they use the main passenger terminals of both Changi and KLIA.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Wellington-Auckland-Singapore-Phnom Penh return. The seats are roomy and offered plenty of leg room (I am 6'2" tall). Staff are friendly and attentive. Each and every flight departed on time and often arrived early. The food we prepaid for was on a par with most other airline meals I've experienced. The $7 comfort pack is good value (you get a blow-up neck cushion a Jetstar blanket socks toothbrush eye cover and all to keep).

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Bangkok to Singapore. Flight left on time and landed on schedule. Clean and new A320. Paid for row 1 and was allowed to board first. One trolley service (they had run out of a lot of items from the inbound flight) but the crew were happy to get anything else. One word of warning I had flown from London and there are no Jetstar staff airside to check me in. I wasn't able to print a boarding pass in advance. Therefore a mad dash into Thailand check in then back out through immigration.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-PEN return. A320 to Penang was old cabin crew made 1 round of sales purchase. A320 to Sin was a new aircraft with leather seats. Purchased a packet of apple juice for S$3. Seat pitch was about 30" which was alright for a short flight. Our family had cabin sized luggage and the airport staff at the gate at offered to check in for us for free. Will fly with Jetstar Asia again.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-HKT. Check in was swift. Plane was delayed for 1 hr due to technical problems. Once boarded everyone was whisked quickly to their seats and push back was almost immediate. Flight time was only 1hr 20mins so there wasn't much interaction with the crew. For a short flight the seats are okay but I can't help but wonder how those flying to PER on this A320 can manage the cramped conditions.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Singapore-Perth. Except for the price the flight was not pleasant. The purser was rude with a passenger and her junior crew. The other crew seemed frustrated working with her. The seat was good for a low cost airline and the legroom was just ok. You can also sit on the emergency exits for 30SGD.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-AKL-SIN. Seats roomy more than adequate legroom and recline. A completely different experience from the A320s used on intra-Asia routes. In fact the seats are way more comfortable than SIA's new Y product. Food was less than satisfactory. If one did not pre-pay SGD/NZD35 for meals and drinks be prepared for SGD6 coffee and SGD26 hot meals if you must have them. Do not understand why a Jetstar Asia flight that plies between Singapore and New Zealand has to offer Jetstar International's menu in AUD alongside super-inflated conversion rates. For example a AUD3 coffee goes for SGD6 AUD5 cup noodles sells for SGD8 hot meal for AUD12 becomes SGD26. which is way more than then current exchange rate of AUD1 to SGD1.3. However it's OK to consume your own food and there is a water fountain with potable water so nobody will go thirsty. There's also free IFE if you don't wish to purchase SGD15 portable units. The drop down screens play one recent movie sitcom and short features there are also 6 radio channels earphones cost SGD3.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Jetstar cancel my flight and I requested for a refund. 5 months and 3 calls later there is still no refund. The last time I communicate with them they told me to wait for 7 business days. I called them again after waiting for another 20 days. Miraculously they ask me to wait for another 15 business days! So I should say it is frustrated and a test of your patience to get your refund. Just pray hard that your flight won't get cancelled then only you will be able to enjoy your cheap flight.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-PNH flight full but got an exit row. They gate-checked my bag for me since no more overhead space. Flight quick and painless no complaints. Plane a bit tired but no big deal for budget airline.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
I booked a Jetstar flight which they cancelled at the last minute giving me a flight that was not workable. I had to call twice to make sure that they knew it wouldn't work and that I wanted my money back. I had to pay a higher last minute fee to rebook at a different airline. They promised me my money back within 7-10 business days. It has not been more than 6 weeks with no return of money. I filed a complaint on their website. They said they would look into it within 2 weeks. That has now been a month since they have communicated with me at all. I would never book a flight with them again. Buyer beware! They can mess you up and then not return your money. Meanwhile you have had to book a last minute flight which is more expensive.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
MNL-SIN-MNL: Flights with relatively new A320s. Leather seats adequate in width although pitch was only barely acceptable (29.5 inches). As on most low cost carriers there were no blankets or pillows in sight but a daytime flight. Neither in SIN nor in MNL did we have to wait more than ten minutes at the carousel for our bags. We didn't try JetStar Asia's meal service which the airline charges for. Flight attendants efficient. Safety procedures were excellent. Cabin announcements a bit difficult to comprehend both from the flight deck and the cabin attendants. Toilets were clean. Overall the standard of these flights was good better than on some of JetStar Asia European counterparts although the seat pitch was less than advertised. Would we fly with them again? Yes but we might consider upgrading to a seat in an emergency exit row for S$30 extra in each direction.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Melbourne to Singapore delayed by one hour. Pre-ordered meals were average similar meals on offer both times. Return trip an evening flight again delayed by 1 hour. Headphones not working in group of middle seats. Service was poor and meals pre-ordered on this sector were that bad you could not eat it especially the breakfast. Hot tea was spilt on a passenger nearby and could not believe that staff had no idea how to deal with the situation. Cabin- crew on this return leg was so disappointing that I will pay more to travel on a more reliable airline.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Although not comparable to 5 star airlines if you can find cheap tickets it would be worthwhile! Singapore from Perth and back again. Flight was very quick don't bother to pre- order meals (on the red eye flight at least) - poor cup noodles and bland soup. Flight attendants very nice. If over 170cm you may want to choose seats with extra legroom. Return at check in the lady allowed me and my 3 sibling to check in together which allowed us to combine our luggage weights - we were 8kg over. Secondly she bumped us up to the front row seated together which had plenty of legroom. Purchased some food on the plane - reasonably priced.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
HKG-SIN-HKG. Check-in smooth 20kg allowance which is better than some budget airlines. At Singapore Changi Airport the counter will only open 2 hours before departure therefore no need to arrive earlier than that. Unlike some low-cost airlines seat is allocated at check-in time. Both flights depart on-time. The seat is comfortable. No service it is nothing more than a bus that can fly. In my booking given the price is 45% cheaper than conventional airlines I have no complaint. I would recommend this airline if and only if the price is at least 30% cheaper than the conventional airlines for the same direct flight.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
KUL-SIN-KUL. This is my first experience with Jetstar Asia. The fare is cheap and comparable with other Low Cost Airlines. FAs and Ground Staff helpful and efficient. The departure at KUL was on time but for the return flight there was slight delay for half an hour. The plus point is that they depart from KUL Main Terminal and not LCCT.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Singapore - Jakarta. Flight over 1 hr late which I expected as Changi Airport departures showed this flight as late every day for the previous week. Captain apologised for the slight delay but apologies become meaningless when the airline keeps doing it! The airline should drop or reschedule this flight to a time within their capabilities as it isn't at the moment. It's certainly cheap and the attendants did their jobs satisfactorily but persistent lateness isn't acceptable.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Jakarta to Singapore not good at all. Senior FA rude with passenger and her junior FA. The seat was good for LCC airline and legroom is not bad. The ticket price is very cheap too.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
KUL-SIN. What's great about Jetstar in KL is that they fly from the Main Terminal instead of the LCCT which makes the experience so much better for the same or less price. Seat for me were spacious for a budget airline compared to Airasia.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-KIX-SIN via TPE. Almost full flight on inaugural service but less than five passengers from Singapore headed to Osaka the rest got off at Taipei. Fairly standard procedure transit passengers have to exit the plane with all belongings at TPE airport for another security screening. KIX flights are staffed with two Japanese crew members with very proficient English and somewhat friendlier. There’s a new menu with more selections but meal portions can be improved. Inflight announcements for TPE-KIX should also be made in Chinese but not English since less than a handful are transit passengers. They should also offer change in the local currency for F&B sales. One particular FA (customer service manager) on the inbound flight gave really awful announcements. Although total flight time adds up to more than eight hours from SIN to KIX there is huge potential if the price is right.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-CGK-SIN. First flight to Jakarta was satisfactory they have improved their services by providing free refreshments. Leg space satisfactory for a short haul budget airline flight. However the big problem came in on the flight back to Singapore. Flight was delayed for almost 5 hours due to a mechanical failure and bad weather further preventing quick repairs and getting the plane back on schedule. This caused all passengers to be stranded at the airport and even causing a passenger to miss 2 connecting flights. Jetstar however gave a good explanation and their sincere apology. I would prefer if Jetstar could have back-up aircraft despite being a budget airline to attend to these situations and prevent major delays like this from occuring.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
BKK-SIN-BKK return. Leg room seemed quite normal for a short haul flight food options what you would expect for a no frills airline and price competitive. Quite impressed and would use again. One wrinkle is that you cannot bring your own food to eat on these flights but can do so on one of the other Jetstar carriers - unclear how the average passenger is supposed to know which is which (and probably unenforceable in any case).

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-HKG-SIN. The seats are a pain for a tall person like myself. Service wise it's not that good some of them can't really bothered with you - I'm not having high hopes on service. Food at high prices. Judging that price difference nowadays between Jetstar and conventional airline is not that great maybe is time to go back to conventional ones.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-MNL: While the flight itself was fine there were two major problems. First hot food on this evening flight ran out before reaching row 10 and service was painfully slow. Second I had to pay quite a lot money for my lost luggage that arrived the next day (phone calls taxis to/from the airport to pick up the luggage and even a luggage storage fee!) with no compensation whatsoever. Very poor service!

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-HKT return. Both flights on Valuair A320 fantastic legroom and recline. Loads were really low averaging 60 pax per flight.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Perth - Bali and Jakarta - Perth. Check-in at Perth Airport a nightmare with only 2 check-in counters opened for a fully booked flight. The crew were not friendly or helpful. On the return flight they kept the light on all the flight. The blanket is not a good thing to purchase meals and beverages also an issue - whatever was on the menu it was not available for purchase.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
BKK-SIN. Check-in was efficient - just as well because the immigration queue at BKK was very slow moving. I was able to check my bag through to Australia which was an unexpected bonus. Cabin service was friendly and professional safety procedures thorough flight on time. A great first impression.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-KUL-SIN. First leg was on Valuair good legroom with older seats. Return was slightly delayed but captain explained the reason. Legroom was bad lucky the flight was only 55 minutes long.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
I just got off Jetstar Asia flight HKG to Singapore. The flight was delayed for 40 minutes upon departure and landed 35 minutes behind schedule with no reason given whatsoever. The captain could not even be bothered to speak to passengers but what really took the cake tonight was the apathy and oblivion of the cabin crew to the needs of passengers. I'd take Air Asia over Jetstar Asia any day of the week (unfortunately no direct flight between HKG and SIN yet)

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-DPS return. Got a great low fare a few months back so on that front pretty happy. Flights out and back both on time clean planes young crew decent enough English. Seat comfort is OK tight seat pitch as to be expected for any budget carrier these days. The limited Buy on board menu seemed expensive especially since everything was priced in Aussie Dollars. Don't think I'd fly a longer sector with them.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-KUL. My only problem is that they don't offer online or self-service check-in for flights originating from Australia. That means I had to proceed to the manned check-in counters even if I had no luggage to check-in. Other than that the flight was more or less on time upon arrival at KUL.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN-KUL and SIN-HKIA. SIN-KUL price is reasonable and it was only a 35 minute flight. SIN- Hong Kong was intolerable. Passengers are not allowed to bring food on the plane so that whoever wanted food has to buy their ridiculously high priced foods. Leg space also very uncomfortable. Overall it is value for money but will not take Jetstar again for flights longer than 2 hours as comfort is greatly compromised on JetStar.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
SIN to KUL - ok service. Overall service standard : boarding and disembarking was good. Other than that Jetstar is not too special. Worth flying them if their fares remain low.

### Jetstar Asia customer review
Singapore - Bangkok. The food is of less variety compared to other regional low cost airlines. For the 2 hour flight would expect some hot meal to be sold onboard not just sandwiches. As this is a low cost airline do not expect much from their onboard services. I used to borrow a pen from a flight attendant to fill the immigration card but my request was simply ignored. For those who wish to fly with this airline kindly be reminded to stick to "bring your own pen policy". I am afraid this is my last flight with them.
