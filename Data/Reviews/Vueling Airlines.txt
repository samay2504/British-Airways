### “impossible to speak to a real person”
Not Verified |  This airline is the worst airline you could choose. If you have any extra luggage, you pay dearly. We needed to cancel our flight and it was a nightmare to cancel because if it didn't fall into the 4 reasons they state you can cancel. Because of this, you don't have any proof that you canceled to give to your travel insurance. It's impossible to speak to a real person and they will just hang up on you if you don't fit into their phone selections. Stay away from this airline. I lost my money and any way to get it back through my insurance.

### "seat is not refundable"
Was held at check-in where someone took my passport, did not explain what's wrong and had to talk with multiple people to get it back? Was asked to scan my boarding pass multiple times despite it working from the very first time? Never got an explanation and was asked hastily to go on the plane. Bought priority seats and everything but by the time I was onboard I had to put my luggage further down, delaying everything on my way off. Stewardesses did nothing, both in the beginning or the end. Asked a refund as I basically didn't benefit from the priority ticket/seat. Didn't have space for one piece of luggage, let alone two. Received email today that seat is not refundable which is insane given the subpar service on literally everything.

### "cabin bag sizes are so small"
The prices for tickets are low, but the cabin bag sizes are so small that anything bigger than a purse doesn't fit. I had to pay 60 euros for 20cm extra.

### "Very bad luggage policy"
Very bad luggage policy. They lost our luggage for 3 days for four adults, they told us on the phone we could buy necessity clothes, which we did. We asked 3 times if there was a limit of spending, answer was no. When claiming for compensation, we were told there is a limit of 50 euros per day per person (which is fair), but then they compensate you for just one luggage/person because you only have one PIR number, which is the file code they give you at the airport when you report the missing luggage! They told me even if you had 10 bags lost, with one PIR number we would give you compensation just for one. finally, this information is not available anywhere on their website.

### “does not care about frequent flyers”
I’ve flown 46 flights with Vueling within the last 12 months at the time of this review - and despite the claim that they grant you “premium” status from 40 flights onwards” Vueling Customer service team keep refusing to grant me the status. They claim the problem is that I previously used a different Vueling Club account number linked to an email address I no longer use. They said I could resolve this by creating new account and then they would merge them. Even though they claim this happened - my flights no longer correctly show on the new account. After countless of contact back and forth with the customer service team about this I received a standard reply to my queries, putting the blame on me for not stating my loyalty number or email correctly at the time of booking. Not only did I always list my club account number when booking - I followed all their instructions to change and merge my loyalty accounts. Still they only reply in relation to my Avios and not the number of flights and reaching Premium status. Since this message I’ve contacted them thrice as well as emailed the CEO - without any reply. This company does not even care about their frequent flyers that fly more than 50 times per year with them… avoid at all cost!

### "pay an additional $130 for the 2 bags"
Hidden fees and awful Customer Service made it a terrible decision to fly on Vueling. I was looking forward to a great travel experience at a low cost. At the time of booking I paid for 2 checked bags in the hold, though my bags could fit in the overhead compartment. At the gate Vueling forced me pay an additional $130 for the 2 bags to be placed in the hold. The gate agent said I could file for a refund but that was false. Weeks of frustrating attempts at emailing and calling Customer Service went by and not only was I never permitted to talk to a supervisor, they denied the claim for double-billing and refused to offer even a partial refund or future flight credit. I won’t be flying Vueling again.

### "deemed non-compliant with airline regulations"
I was denied boarding on my flight from Naples to Barcelona because my electric wheelchair, which contains two 180Wh batteries, was deemed non-compliant with airline regulations. This was despite my batteries being well within the 300Wh limitset by IATA for lithium-ion batteries in mobility aids. Vueling’s own policy** (published on their website) stating that non-removable, securely attached batteries have no maximum Watt-hour limit. Properly declaring my wheelchair and batteries during booking and again at check-in. Even with these facts, I was told I could only board if I left my batteries behind. This would have rendered my wheelchair useless and left me without any mobility. As a result, I had to stay behind, incurring significant unexpected costs for hotel accommodations, meals, and alternate travel arrangements. Lufthansa approved my wheelchair for transport without issue just a few hours later. Vueling’s actions demonstrated a lack of training, poor customer service, and disregard for accessibility rights. If you are traveling with a disability or require assistance, I strongly recommend avoiding Vueling Airlines.

### "refusing to compensate me"
I experienced the worst treatment of my life with Vueling Airlines. They overbook flights, can refuse boarding without explanation to passengers with valid boarding passes and assigned seats, and provide either incompetent customer support when handling compensation claims afterwards. Following a boarding denial on September 8th with a rebooking on a flight the next day, they are still refusing to compensate me and my partner, claiming that the boarding denial did not occur. This is despite having all their emails confirming the forced rebooking onto a subsequent flight and outlining the right to claim compensation. I have made multiple attempts to contact them through every available channel (X DMs, phone, email) after submitting my compensation claim online and providing all the required evidence. However, nearly three months later, this issue remains unresolved. It is truly scandalous that a company with such practices is allowed to continue operating within the European Union.

### "the best price on this route"
Second last Vueling flight out of Gatwick on Sunday evening. Lots of problems that evening with weather in BCN and especially to the south of that airport so plane in was delayed. Early indications were for a 70 minute delay but the crew were anxious to make up for lost time and expedited boarding. Unfortunately the Captain then informed us that BCN was limiting arrivals and that we would need to wait for 20-30 minutes before pushing back, so losing the advantage that the efficiency of crew had apparently won for us. Flight left as outlined per previous comments. Flight was exceedingly smooth; which counts for an awful lot with this passenger. (Perhaps because we flew straight across Paris rather than down the Atlantic coast; but the tannoy was so poor that I couldn't make out the comments 'not' heard. Unfortunate! But unimportant vs arriving safely; and that after a very smooth flight.) Very minor hiccups on arrival, exactly 60 mins after fairly generous scheduled time. Which left the Captain more than a little frustrated as he and his crew had been super-efficient. Overall, it's not the QE2 or the Hilton for sure, but in my experience Vueling is always (?) the best price on this route which we use 2 or 3 times per year and, based on that degree of exposure to this company, I contend that their service is by not as poor as a number of recent posts here suggest.

### "lacks any comfort or space"
Outbound flight on time (which is what they promise, not something to praise), Inbound announced 90 minutes late close to scheduled time for no apparent reason leading to a long, dull wait in Bilbao airport where there are not enough seats. On the plane there could be no way to squeeze in more seats if they tried; as a consequence the whole flight lacks any comfort or space whatsoever. The USB sockets don’t work, nor, it was announced, does the wifi. Not much to say about the paid for menu one way or the other. Overall it’s a grim way to travel with nothing to recommend it.

### "never fly with these guys again"
Not Verified | Flight cancelled when we are at the airport. Charged €440.00 for a coach bus ride from San Sebastián to Barcelona. No compensation whatsoever for the loss. I would never fly with these guys again, and I would actively discourage anybody I know from doing so as well.

### "bags got lost and delayed for 48 hours!
Do not use this airline! We were 2 people travelling on separate bookings and during our connection our 2 bags got lost and were delayed for 48 hours ruining the first 2 days of our holiday. The person at the airport only created 1 PIR incident and included the 2 lost suitcases in it. We obviously opened 2 claims with 2 different claim numbers as this was 2 people on 2 different bookings. They have paid 1 of the claims and now have closed the PIR incident without paying the 2nd claim. I called last week and spoke to an agent who said that a supervisor would call me. A week later no one had called me so I asked for a supervisor to call me back. This time, a supervisor called me back saying that the PIR was closed and he understood that it wasn't fair that only 1 claim had been settled but that it was legal and I would be getting nothing and to ask the other person to share half of his compensation. Will never fly Vueling again and would advice no one to fly with Vueling either.

### “Thank you for the treatment received”
Not Verified | On October 10th I flew on VY2226 BCN-SVQ. It was the first time I flew with them and I was very scared as I am terrified of flying. The truth is that I am very happy because the crew reassured me and helped me at all times to cope better. Thank you for the treatment received and for such a positive experience. I will fly with them again and I recommend the airline without a doubt. See you soon.

### "did not communicate by email"
Vueling by far is the worst airline. I have flown them many times since unfortunately from Barcelona, most of the time its the only option. They are very sneaky in making sure that you pay extras which I do not mind if there is value but there is not. The worst was yesterday from Gran Canaria, the flight was delayed almost 3 hours which happens sometimes, but they did not communicate by email, nor SMS nor there was ground staff to inform, it was absolute chaos. Once boarding started, the staff was rushing to board people telling them to hurry up and the pilot started taxiing while passengers are not seated. The other thing is that they never have food on board or have like one option, this cost cutting tactic to force you to buy only what they want you to buy is just wrong. On average I take 10 flights a year with Vueling and I can not find one nice thing to say.

### "never use them again"
Arrived at check-in passports and boarding pass on hand to be told (no explanation) that our booking had been cancelled. Forced to rebook (exactly same seats) for more than double the original cost. All attempts to contact vueling lead to the same dead end , they got your money and don't intend to refund it no matter what. These people are worse than criminals as far as I am concerned. I will never use them again, I would rather walk.

### “Customer service is inefficient”
Not Verified | Worst Airline! Always delays, no expalanation only delays. I missed my connection flight and the only thing the said was : “sorry”. Customer service is inefficient. No help from them. Vueling never again! It’s a shame is part of British Airways group.

### "Extremely rude staff"
Not Verified |  Extremely rude staff, very unprofessional. They made us pay 60 Euros for the luggages that fit into the box. And because we had a connection, they made us pay double. All together 240 Euros. As a customer you don’t have any rights with this company. Both flights had significant delays. Although they have very bad reviews, they just don’t care. I would advise choosing any other company if possible.

### “strongly advise against choosing Vueling”
Not Verified | I strongly advise against choosing Vueling for your next flight in Europe. In my experience, it is the worst airline I have ever flown with. They do not provide any notification of changes to flight times or gate assignments. Preferred boarding" is a waste of money, as it does not actually exist. Additionally, paying for in-cabin carry-on is pointless, as there is no space available. The service people at the check-in counter are unhelpful and provide little assistance.

### "have to pay 60 euro for each bag"
We have three carry bag which we always used in plane never have problem with the size of 43cm*32cm*17cm which fit under seat. When we reached airport the lady who working for Vueling said you have to pay 60 euro for each bag, we ask her measuring tape or anything she said she do not have anything. i believe we are get targeted to pay extra money. I complain to customer service they do not did nothing. I asked them where i can complain about their airline three times they even not reply back so surprise

### "offers me $50 compensation"
Destroyed my checked luggage by running it over with a truck before putting what was left of it on the luggage carousel. All reflected in the report and the incident was called to Nice airport luggage service before even releasing the luggage in my custody. Now Vueling offers me $50 compensation when my bag alone costs over $500 and was purchased 1 week prior to that trip, was brand new. Also the damaged contents, some of them lost on tarmac after the bag got run over by a truck.

### "impossible to reach a live person"
Not Verified | The whole thing already started before the flight. Booking and preparation all online and easy, but you can't make any changes after you book something, once they took your money, they don't give it back. I had added a checked in bag, but did not need it, which I indicated already before the flight. They don't reimbursed me for it. It's was 100€. Everything is done over AI almost impossible to reach a live person, which can't do anything for you. Unfortunately that's a 0 for me.

### "a typical low cost airline"
In Athens you can not web-check-in. You can bid for 1st row or the following 3 rows with extra leg room. Getting extra leg seat gets you priority boarding. Wifi was not operating. Plane arrived with 30 minutes delay. Cabin was not clean. Crew was indifferent to me. It is a typical low cost airline

### ”unconscionable conduct from Vueling”
We bought tickets from the Vueling website and arrived at the check-in only to be told our tickets have been cancelled and that we would have to book another flight. We got no notification of the cancellation via email or SMS. The best we could do is book another flight several hours later which was significantly more expensive. So their mistake forced us to provide them even more money to be able to continue our scheduled travels. Update: After filing a complaint, Vueling responded that them cancelling our flights was 'beyond our control' and 'As it was an extraordinary circumstance, which we were not able to avoid despite putting all reasonable measures in place, in accordance with Article 5.3 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament, and with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, you are not entitled to any form of compensation. On a subsequent flight with Vueling, we were delayed an hour checking into the airport because their automated check-in machine seemingly wasn't working for anybody. At least we were allowed onto the plane this time. However, we had to wait almost another 2 hours in the plane while it was being repaired on the runway. Out of three of our journeys with Vueling, two of them we experienced issues. Further, they seem completely shameless in not correcting their own mistakes. Absolutely unconscionable conduct from Vueling, avoid.

### "wouldn’t let us on"
Not Verified |   Just shocking, flight from Barcelona to Venice overbooked and wouldn’t let us on. 1 hour 45 minutes to queue for customer services, to be told it was our fault. Had to pay extra to fly 5 hours later, and they even charged us 60 euros for a bag that was booked on the earlier flight. I’ve been flying 36 years and my worst ever experience!

### "Service was good"
Not Verified |   Flew with Vueling as it was about £150 cheaper than flying with Ryanair or Easyjet. Easy check in at Cardiff Flight left on the dot. Plane was clean. Service was good. No issues, will look to book with them in the future.

### "they asked me to pay 60 EUR"
I bought a one way multi leg flight ticket with Vueling from Malaga to Barcelona and from Barcelona to Geneva. I brought a backpack with me as hand luggage and, despite it fitted in the basket for luggage to be put under your seat, they asked me to pay 60 EUR x 2 legs = 120 EUR as according to them it did not fit well in the basket. I refused to pay and I had to book another flight. I would advise other travelers from Vueling with hand luggage who believe that they should not pay for their hand luggage to get on board as soon as possible. Why? Because it Vueling staff get abusive, there would be many witnesses who can also record with their mobile phones what is happening. Also if they get abusive and start discussing with a passenger, then the flight would delay because of them. Otherwise, if you are boarding the last one like me, they can just ask you to pay any amount even if your hand luggage fits the required measurements.

### "very nice experience"
This was a seamless experience, from booking to the actual trip. Booking was easy and the costs transparent. So were the baggage rules. Downloading boarding passes easy and so was the actual check-in (using the app). Boarding in Santiago was smooth, no delays and no unnecessary wating (excpet 15 minutws to due traffic control restrictions). The plane was seemingly new and modern with wi-fi and Usb charging. The seats were not reclining and rather tight spacewize as most budget airlines but for a short flight it was no issue. Good selection of food and beverages. All in all, highly a very nice experience and highly recommene

### "extra 60 EUR for our luggage"
Our family has purchased the flight Barcelona-Munich. We have purchased extra luggage for 15 kg. On the day of the flight, we made the check-in online and arrived at the airport. We have passed successfully all security gates. In the line for the boarding, the staff approached us and said that we needed to pay an extra 60 EUR for our luggage. They said that we purchased the check-on luggage that we didn't bring for check-in in time and to bring it on board we had to pay. Qe had no information that the company treated 15 kg cabin luggage as Check-in luggage.During online check-in nothing mentioned that we have to drop off check-in luggage. The size of our luggage was within the cabin size (55x40x20). They hide information from customers to be able to charge fees at the moment customers have no options.

### "will not fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Our family of six were to fly out of Morocco to Rome. 12 hours before the flight we checked on line to confirm our flight details. It had been canceled and we had not been notified. They told us they would provide us a flight 4 days later. No accommodations were offered. We chose another airline that would take us the next day if we could take a train to Casablanca. We have tried to get reimbursed the dollars we are out but Veuling has zero customer service. So disappointed. We will not fly with them again.

### "deflect any attempt at a claim"
Not Verified |  I have used Vueling for many different trips and have never had an issue. However, recently my flight was cancelled and rescheduled for the next day. Vueling did pay for the hotel, however, the passengers were instructed to find their own transportation, pay themselves, and ask for reimbursement. I followed these instructions, paid for my taxis, saved the receipts and asked for my reimbursement. Vueling has made every effort possible to avoid compensating me for these taxi fees (which totaled to be 100 euros). It has been over a month since, with multiple calls to Vueling and Iberia, but I have concluded that they will not pay me back and that I have wasted my time. Vueling is a good low budget option, however, if a flight cancellation happens and you must incur your own expenses, they will not compensate you and will make every possible effort to deflect any attempt at a claim that you may have. It is very disappointing because I do like the airline, but I must accept that any mistake or delay that comes from the airline, the costs will fall on the customers.

### "Terrible customer service"
Vueling: Terrible customer service! I am appalled by the treatment we received from Vueling Airlines following the loss of our suitcase on our recent flight. Not only was the suitcase never delivered, but their customer service refused to process the file and compensate us, claiming otherwise! We have followed all procedures and provided all necessary information, but Vueling continues to deny its responsibilities. This is unacceptable! I call for transparency and accountability from Vueling. If you have had a similar experience with this company, share it in the comments. It is time for consumers to be heard and for measures to be taken to improve this company's customer service. | Vueling: Un service client déplorable ! Je suis consternée par le traitement que nous avons reçu de la part de Vueling Airlines suite à la perte de notre valise lors de notre récent vol. Non seulement la valise n'a jamais été livrée, mais leur service client refuse de traiter le dossier et de nous indemniser en prétendant le contraire ! Nous avons suivi toutes les procédures et fourni toutes les informations nécessaires, mais Vueling persiste à nier ses responsabilités. C'est inacceptable ! J'appelle à la transparence et à la responsabilité de la part de Vueling. Si vous avez vécu une expérience similaire avec cette compagnie, partagez-la dans les commentaires. Il est temps que les consommateurs soient entendus et que des mesures soient prises pour améliorer le service à la clientèle de cette compagnie.

### “Staff are rude and useless”
Very disappointed with this Airline. I'll never book again and will advise the customers not to book with Vueling. There is a lot of hidden cost when you check in at the airport. When tried to check-in online, it won't accept any of my details and it advise to check at the desk. I've been charged £280 for 4 hand luggage which most Airlines don't charge and we were 6 of us. Normally hand baggage is free and you pay only for big luggages. There were less than 5kg in each hand luggage. Vueling is a RIP off company. Staff are rude and useless.

### “made TWO botched attempts at landing”
Booked a short one-way flight from Barcelona to Bilbao. Our incompetent pilot made TWO botched attempts at landing and was unable to do, blaming the weather. However, according to arrivals data from the Bilbao airport, several other flights landed just fine within a few minutes of when our flight's incompetent or impaired pilot could not do so. I think the BIO Tower wisely refused to give him a THIRD try at endangering the lives of passengers and he had to turn the plane around and return back to BCN. I then had to take a grueling 7 hr bus ride to get to Bilbao 9.5 hrs later than scheduled. I emailed Vueling demanding a refund, and got an automated reply stating, "We confirm that we have received your message. We have taken note of your comments and we have forwarded them to the relevant department to take the appropriate measures. It's been a MONTH since then and no other response. I tried calling their "Customer Service" line in Spain - they have NO toll-free or USA phone number, so it will cost you - only to get endlessly looped in their automated phone system multiple times, or told "Please hold for an agent. and then their system would immediately drop the call. Reading other reviews here and elsewhere, it is apparently Vueling's policy to simply play dead and keep your money. Don't risk your life booking a Vueling flight like I think I did on the THREE landing attempts of this first and last ever Vueling flight I took.

### "never use that low cost airline again"
Not Verified |  My flight on ITA Airlines was 35 minutes late. Didn't think much of it since we had 2 hours until our flight on Vueling. By the time we got our bags from ITA and then went to the Check In Counter for Vueling, we missed their cutoff of 50 minutes before departure. (I have never encountered that in the 50 plus years that I have been taking air flights.) We had 40 minutes to get on the flight but the Check In person would not help us. It was repeated several times that we were late and there was nothing to be done. We then had to find an airline that could get us to our destination that day. Cost us $1000 plus. When we returned to the states, we started to file with our travel insurance firm. My wife and I both called Vueling "Customer Service, looking for statement that we were denied entry onto the flight. I was disconnected from the phone call 7 times. The people in their "Customer Service" are the most rude people that I have ever encountered in my life. (BTW that is a very long time. I'm 76 years old.) I will never use that low cost airline again. So, my fellows travelers, beware!

### “it was a perfect flight”
Nothing to say, it was a perfect flight. Just before boarding (I’m megavolotea), we have to wait 1h without seat, even though the plane was  not there yet! Maybe Volotea should give more attention to megavolotea.

### "Vueling impressed me"
On 27th October 2023, I used the services of Vueling for a flight from Santiago De Compostela to London Gatwick airport. The website for booking the flight is very clear and easy to use. I found the price to be reasonable but not cheap. I arrived at Santiago airport an extra hour ahead of the recommended time and was wise to do so. Vueling only had 1 person on the check-in desk when I used the service to drop off my bag. The staff member was friendly and informative. Boarding was managed in a very efficient manner but I noted that the staff failed to assist a family traveling with a very disabled child. The parents had to ask several times for help and were left to their own devices. There was a very slight delay in departure this had no impact at all on the arrival of the flight. The service provided was very friendly and efficient during the flight. I did not use the wifi so I cannot comment on that. I bought a drink and snack from the trolley service and had a most favourable impression of the hardworking crew. Disembarkation was very managed on a row by row basis. This is a logical and very fair way to manage the process. I wish more airlines enforced this rule! All of the crew were visible during the flight and offered a very good level of service. Vueling impressed me! I would certainly fly with them again.

### "came as a most pleasant surprise"
Vueling came as a most pleasant surprise! I booked a Vueling flight to travel from Seville to Santiago De Compostela on 26th October 2023. When I arrived at Seville airport, I encountered an incredibly long queue for check-in. There was no separate bag-drop which was curious as I had already checked-in online. Several destinations were served by the same check-in desks with at one stage only 2 desks open. There was so much luggage that the staff had to stop the queue until the luggage was cleared. The check-in staff were very friendly and helpful, full credit to them given the volume of passengers they were coping with. I shall add that I allowed myself 1 extra hour for this process above the recommended time on the Vueling ticket. Boarding was smooth and well managed by firm uniformed staff who tried to enforce a sensible “by group” process. The cabin-crew gave each passenger a warm welcome and I saw 2 very proactive staff assisting an elderly gentleman and a young woman with a disabled child. Catering was provided from a “to purchase” trolley service. The cabin crew spoke several languages and appeared to be highly professional and very well turned out in smart uniforms. Clear announcements were made in Spanish and in English. The captain greeted the passengers too and the entire flight felt very civilized and professional. The safety procedure was taken very seriously indeed and this was reflected when disembarking as a row by row process was again imposed and done so in a thorough manner. The flight arrived on-time and bags were delivered promptly. I was impressed with this service on a relatively short domestic flight within Spain. I did not use the WIFI but saw an adjacent passenger do so. I would certainly use this company again.

### "No punctuality"
The worst airline I've travelled with. No punctuality, my flight from Cairo to Madrid were delayed for almost an hour without the guys at the boarding gate saying nothing. In Madrid we were in the shuttle bus for 25 min before driving to the plane. Again not a word! Now my flight to Barcelona is delayed for 2 hours. I am afraid my next flight to Stockholm is going to be delayed because i have a meeting directly after i land at Arlanda Airport. Never count on us” should be their logo.

### "Horrible flight company"
Not Verified |  Horrible flight company. Canceled our flight 3 times. Made us come to the airport although they knew they were not going to depart. The plane wasn't even in the airport. Didn't give us refund, didn't pay the delay costs (stay and food). No one to talk to and in the end cancelled the flight entirely leaving us with no flight. I will never fly again with Vueling Airlines. I recommend you to buy a ticket from a different airline.

### "poor communication and customer care¬"
My flight from London Gatwick to Banjul via Barcelona on Friday 18 August was delayed. There was no communication between the relevant agencies that the flight from London to Barcelona would be delayed and for transit passengers like myself going to Banjul would be late in boarding because of the late arrival of the London flight. I was almost turned away from the boarding gate because the Vueling officials at the gate were not aware that there were transit passengers like myself who were late because of the delayed departure from London. Eventually, I boarded following a conversation between the officials at the gate and the cabin crew. On arrival in Banjul, my luggage had not arrived at the Airport. My luggage eventually arrived a week later with no prior communication from Vueling. Even on their website my luggage was reported as still being looked for. I had to constantly call Banjul airport baggage office to check on the status of my luggage and it was they who confirmed that my luggage was arriving on Friday. When I claimed expenses for the the clothing and other items I had to buy prior to the arrival of my delayed luggage I was sent an insulting payment which did not cover the cost of my expenses. My return journey from Banjul to London via Barcelona was also delayed by a day and when I arrived back in London Gatwick on 6 August my luggage was not at the airport so again I had to complete a baggage lost/delay form. My luggage was still in Barcelona and was finally delivered to my home address later that week. I wrote to Vueling challenging the partial expenses I had been paid and seeking full payment of the expenses which I would not have incurred if they had ensured my luggage arrived on Friday 18 August and seeking compensation for my delayed journey. Being a low cost operator should not mean low quality service, poor communication and customer care.

### "I got charged for a carryon"
Not Verified |  Don’t be fooled by the cheap prices. For all the extra cost you might as well fly with a more reputable airline. I booked this last minute not knowing the extra charges that was on top of my flight cost. It’s not the price it’s more of principle. I got charged for a carryon that clearly can fit in the overhead bin and paid 50euro which is ridiculous. The online price was 57 euro. They had two different measuring examples for carry on luggages. One was a size of a book bag and the other one was actually a carry on. I only saw that when I got the gate and was disappointed. Besides company the Flight Attendants were friendly and did their best to make sure the clients were comfortable.

### "60 euros to put empty bag into the hold2"
I neglected to add on carry-on luggage to my ticket so was made to pay 60 euros to take the luggage on board. That's no problem, I happily paid that, it was my oversight after all. What I found really unacceptable is after I paid my 60 euros I was told as I entered the airplane that it had to go into the hold. This I was not told when I paid the 60 euro's. But again it's no problem, I was willing to put it into the hold. But this is the the part that really annoyed me. I was made to take out all items that contain a battery. All the bag contained was a laptop, action camera, battery operated video recording equipment, 3 power banks and a jacket. I had to remove everything from the bag except my jacket and carry it all onto the plane. They made me pay 60 euros to put an empty bag into the hold any made me carry all the equipment on to the plane. What was the point of that. If you can avoid this airline then I say you're better off if you do. I know in the future I'll be considering all alternative options before I fly with them again.

### “didn’t help me to locate it”
One of worst airlines in Europe. I kept my passport in seat pocket and forgot to take it when offboarded in Amsterdam. The flight was from Bilbao to Amsterdam. I have checked almost every day with the Airline, checked with their service desk in Schiphol airport, emailed, twitted. But airline didn’t locate it or rather didn’t help me to locate it where I have shared all detail (seat no, flight no, date of travel etc). I would recommend if you ever try to fly with Vueling, and forget your Id document on flight, you will never get it back

### "NOT reachable in any way"
Not Verified | My first flight ever. Worst experience ever please read before booking For my first flight ever, we booked a retour with Vueling from Amsterdam to Barcelona. A week in advance, Schiphol airport already showed that our flight was planned for Lisbon rather than Barcelona. I called Vueling 5 times in advance about this and they told me not to worry. The day of arrival, (5am) we see the flight is still planned for Lisbon. Upon checking in, we explicitly this again and they told us not to worry. Upon arriving on Barcelona, after a lot of stress. Our luggage did NOT arrive. Surprise surprise, it went to Lisbon. The woman at the airport stand at Barcelona told us another flight would arrive in 2 hours which she told us to wait for because it carried our luggage. We waited for 2 full hours just to come back empty handed, upon returning to the boot, the woman was gone, replaced by a man who told us he had no view of this and had to fill in an online form. We were now late for our rental car, had no luggage, and had been waiting in stress for hours. Customer support was unreachable unless you say ‘I want to buy a ticket’ and they can earn money on you. Unfortunately this is not where the stress ended. They managed to deliver our luggage after 4.5 days, completely ruining our days before. They were rude, not willing to help, and upon filing my expense claims they took 2 months to deposit the money after 50 calls at least. The refund process what a disaster. They have all kind of tricks to not have to refund you. You need EVERY single paper / boarding pass you got in order to claim a refund. Fortunately I did, yet they tried literally everything to not have to refund me. After countless calls they finally admitted the refund. Now they haven’t even refunded me the full amount of my expenses, are unreachable by e-mail, and not willing to help by phone. Word of advise, do NOT book with Vueling, worst experience of my life, 0 customer service, and NOT reachable in any way, unless you want to buy a ticket!

### "good onboard service"
Not Verified | Nice flight with Vueling with good onboard service and nice plane. Perhaps for the connoisseurs of airplanes Vueling had a good landing, a soft one and the onboard music is very appropriate. The price was cheap slightly more expensive because we booked later but that doesn't matter. |  Fijn gevlogen met Vueling met goede onboard service en fijn vliegtuig. Mischien voor de kenners van vliegtuigen Vueling had een goede landing een zachte en de onboard muziek is heel gepast. De prijs was goedkoop iets duurder omdat we later boekte maar dat maakt niet zo op.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. Cancelled our flight. The alternative offered resulted in a six hour arrival delay. No refund and non existent customer service. Avoid at all costs.

### "delayed more than 120 mins"
Do not travel with this airline, both of my inbound and outbound flight were delayed more than 120 mins! This airline only have delay but nothing, if you dont have time cost or schedule, this airline might meet your expectation!

### "delivering such a poor service"
Not Verified |  People only buy through Vueling because its cheap. The amount of time wasted and plans cancelled if you regularly use this airline really do not compensate. But obviously if you cannot pay more you will continue to use it. Its so shameful and disrespectful of people's lifes to keep delivering such a poor service. I always have to take flights with vueling between Tunisia and Barcelona and its basically the norm that the flight gets late and they dont even inform you about it.

### "Such a bad experience!"
Me and my family (8 people) had a wonderful holiday in Portugal and we were returning reenergised and happy back to Prague on 24.7.23. Unfortunately, our flight with Transavia TO7661 was delayed by one hour on the departure from Lisbon. This would be fine but there was further delay when we arrived to the ORY airport in Paris where we have spent 30 endless minutes waiting before we could disembark. As the airport is large we have not managed to get to the connecting flight with Vueling to Prague VY8948 (scheduled departure at 11.45 CET) on time and the boarding was just closed (for max 5 minutes). The plane was still connected to the hub and the whole situation could have ben sorted out very easily, I think but the reality was different, unfortunately. There were two Vueling representatives (man and woman) at the gate A21 desk at that time and I have had a discussion with the man with glasses trying to convince him to let us get on the board of our flight. He just kept saying no and didn’t want to listen to our arguments at all. There were children (the youngest one 4.5 yrs old) as well as two seniors 60+ in our group, one of them with severe diabetes. Unfortunately, Vueling male representative had no mercy and did not want to listen at all. He just kept saying that we need to go back to the Vueling counter and that we will get another flight with Vueling to Prague free of charge instead. I asked him to call his boss and ask if we could get on board. He just pointed to another person standing nearby. When I asked the person to let us get on board he just started to speak French which felt totally hostile and frustrating. From our point of view, both Vueling representatives were totally disengaged, customer unfriendly and not willing to go an extra mile. It is pity that they managed to ruin our great holiday within few minutes and turn it into the nightmare. As it was clear that we can’t do anything at the gate, me and my wife went out of the security zone to the Vueling client desk as we were advised. We have learnt that the first flight to Prague available is only on 30th of Jul! I can’t even describe our dismay and the level of stress that we were in at that moment. We sat down and started to search for other flights but it was in season and our group was big, so there were no direct flights available. Finally we found an evening flight from CDG Paris to Amsterdam with KLM (KL1246) leaving Paris at 20.15 and connecting flight with KLM next morning leaving AMS at 6.35 (KL1351). We had to travel all the way from Paris ORY to Paris CDG and spend a night at the AMS airport as the consequence. This was really stressful for all and health-threatening for our grandfather with severe diabetes who felt really bad as he run out of insulin. We also had to pay for new flight tickets and transfer from Paris ORY to Paris CDG which meant a significant challenge to our family budget (around 2 k EUR in total). I asked Vueling to compensate us for our horrible experience, stress, health problems and incremental costs but no interest on their side. They just replied we are not eligible for any compensation. Their CEO Mr. Sansavini whom I wrote a personal letter have not even bothered to write back. Vueling? Such a bad experience! Never again.

### "I totally recommend it"
Vueling is one of the best value for money airlines in Europe. Comfortable seats, nice staff and good aircraft fleet selection. I totally recommend it.

### "check in line was too long"
Not Verified | It was a bad experience of us, me and my wife. The airplane was delayed one hour, and they did not offer anything to drink or eat, even water! The check in line was too long, and nearly did not move. We will not choose this airline company again.

### "left in airport without any support"
It was the worst airline ever in my life. First of all, we arrived in an airport in Barcelona. Three were huge lines and only 3/4 open desks. We waiting for a while just for checking in, because it wasn’t possible to make in online. Moreover, it was not possible to make in the automatic machine. The people, that were standing near me in line missed their previous flight, also with Vueling, because after they have been waited for more than hour in a line, they were told that they’re late, however it was 20 minutes before boarding. After all of this stress, my sister wasn’t admitted to a flight, because she hasn’t an individual passport. However, she was added in my mum’s passport and also has a Birth Certificate, and as far as we’re Ukrainians and during the war it’s possible for children to travel without passport, but being in the parent’s passport, the desk worker said it’s not possible with their airline and advised us just to go on the train or bus. We were on holidays in Spain, but live in the Netherlands since the war started, so we were going home. Also, we have been already traveling by plane with the same mum’s passport, where was my sister and the Birth Certificate (as well we went to Spain from Amsterdam). But the worker was even after explanations so hopeless and mean. Then she just threw away our tickets, didn’t even ask if someone from my family still planning to go on a flight (there were me, 2 younger sisters and parents). So we asked again to make new tickets for me and my another sister, what took also a bit of time. My parents and the second sister left in airport without any support, explanation what they should to do and of course without a refund. That’s just crazy! Hope they will hire more professional staff, who would be more caring about people. Very disappointed and will never recommend this airline.

### "poorly trained and uninterested staff"
What a poorly trained and uninterested staff at this company. Because our suitcase was gone for 4 days on the way there, we had to buy the necessary things and therefore we had more luggage than on the way there. When checking in at VUELING I already saw that they would be quite strict, so I saw an option to take 2 pieces of hand luggage pp if we were to travel priority. That cost 50 euros pp more, but then we would also be in the front row with extra legroom and be the first to enter in a priority row and somewhere you also think that you will receive better treatment. Well believe me, none of that! The only thing that was right was that we were allowed to take that extra hand luggage with us. But at check-in you had 3 classes, 1 that was us, 2 that were the people behind us who I thought had also paid a lot (not) and 3 that was even further back. So I asked one of the crew members how it worked and he sent us to the other side, when I arrived there I suddenly saw the sign of class 1 and 2 together, so I walk back to that man, he says casually, oh yes sorry, now 40 men of class 2 in front of us, so nothing priority. A girl in front of us in line said she hadn't paid anything extra for this class 2 seat, so we were getting an increasingly annoying feeling. Once on the plane, the first row suddenly turned into the 2nd row, where you had significantly less legroom, so again the VUELING staff were tipsy and they pretended their noses were bleeding. That line was already reserved by a family. That family (Portuguese or Spanish) of 4 suddenly had 6 places at their disposal. The staff was not friendly at all and kept hiding behind a curtain. We had bought two small bottles of rose and a bottle of water at the airport for the plane, when she discovered that they got angry too, because that was not allowed, we should have bought it from them. Wat een slecht opgeleid en ongeinteresseerd personeel bij deze maatschappij. Doordat onze koffer 4 dagen weg was op de heenweg moesten we natuurlijk het nodige aanschaffen en daardoor hadden we meer bagage dan op de heenweg. Bij het inchecken bij VUELING zag ik al dat zij vrij streng zouden zijn dus ik zag een mogelijkheid om 2 stuks handbagage pp mee te mogen nemen als we priority zouden reizen. Dat koste wel 50 euro pp meer maar dan zouden we ook nog op de eerste rij zitten met extra beenruimte en als eerste naar binnen mogen bij een priorityrij en ergens denk je dan ook nog dat je een betere behandeling zult krijgen. Nou geloof me, niets van dat alles! Het enige wat wel klopte was dat we die extra handbagage mee mochten nemen. Maar bij het inchecken had je 3 klasses, 1 dat waren wij, 2 dat waren de mensen achter ons waarvan ik dacht dat zij ook flink hadden betaald (not) en 3 dat was nog verder naar achteren. Dus ik vroeg aan een van de bemanningsleden hoe het werkte en die stuurde ons naar een andere kant, daar aangekomen zag ik ineens het bordje van klasse 1 en 2 tezamen, dus ik loop terug naar die man, zegt hij doodleuk, o ja sorry, inmiddels dus 40 man van klasse 2 voor ons, niks priority dus. Een meisje voor ons in de rij vertelde dat zij helemaal niets extra had betaald voor deze stoel van klasse 2, dus we kregen een steeds vervelender gevoel. Eenmaal in het vliegtuig bleek de eerste rij ineens veranderd in de 2e rij, waar je beduidend minder beenruimte had, dus weer het personeel van VUELING aangeschoten en die deden alsof hun neus bloedde. Die rij was al door een gezin gereserveerd. Dat gezin (Portugees of Spaans) van 4 had dus ineens 6 plaatsen tot hun beschikking. Het personeel was helemaal niet vriendelijk en verstopte zich steeds achter een gordijntje. Wij hadden op het vliegveld twee kleine flesjes rose en een flesje water gekocht voor in het vliegtuig, toen ze dat ontdekte werden ze nog boos ook, want dat mocht niet, dat hadden we bij hen moeten kopen.

### "Have not heard anything from them"
Lost luggage on 7/21/23. Immediately filed a report. Have not heard anything from them other than their automatic emails telling me they are sorry and to be patient. I can see my luggage is still at  FCO airport from my AirTag. Cannot get through to lost and found customer service line to speak to someone. Left voicemails and emails, but still have not been contacted back.

### "don't expect any customer service to help you"
I can't comment on the quality of a Vueling flight because we never got off the ground. When we arrived at SCQ Spain airport on 18/6/23 we found our 18.15 flight to Gatwick was delayed. After a long wait finally the boarding time came up as 20.10hrs, but still boarding wasn't started for around half an hour later. Everyone is now sitting on board the plane luggage in overhead lockers, doors closed when an announcement is made that the staff have now been working for too many hours and the flight is cancelled!! Wouldn't they know that before we got on the plane? We are told to get off the plane and that someone on the first floor would help us. There was someone there, but they knew nothing and didn't know what to tell everyone, they soon disappeared. Every now and then a staff member would appear and the plane load of 200 plus people would converge on them demanding to know what was going on, but still they couldn't tell us anything! This went on till around 22.30hrs gradually people started slipping away as they were getting sick of waiting around they were making their own arrangements for accommodation and travel. We were told by some people who managed to speak to a staff member that they could not offer us another flight to our destination till 23/6/23 five days after we were meant to be there! Exhausted and sick of no helpful answers we gave up waiting, booked our own accommodation that night arriving there starving hungry after 2300hrs. Fortunately someone had the sense to start a WhatsApp group for passengers before people left so we could find out what other people were experiencing. Some people who stayed around and refused to leave had their accommodation that night arranged and paid for them including breakfast, but they didn't get in till around 0100hrs. That should have been offered to everyone immediately. We ended up catching a bus to Porto the next day and flying with another airline the morning after that, so we had to pay for another night's accommodation in Porto. Our travel agent has applied for a refund of our tickets, but there has been none so far 4 weeks later. I applied for EU compensation through Vueling which has been paid. I also applied to Vueling for reimbursement of our accommodation on the night of the cancellation as well as the bus we took to Porto, and the 2 nights lost accommodation in the UK as these were costs we incurred as a direct result of the flight cancellation. They have reimbursed me for the accommodation on the night of the cancellation only so am trying to recoup the rest on travel insurance. I had to supply all my receipts and boarding pass for the other airline to Vueling, I don't know why when all they paid for was the one night. So if you do book with Vueling and your flight gets cancelled don't expect any customer service to help you or full reimbursement of your out of pocket expenses. My advice is don't take the chance. We found the replacement flight with Easy Jet quite good.

### "two pieces of luggage left behind"
My husband and I were traveling from JFK to Venice. We had a connecting flight from Barcelona to Venice with Vueling. The first problem we encountered at JFK we had to pay for our luggage from JFK to Barcelona and then to Venice even though we did not have to check in our luggage at Barcelona. They charged us 350 Euro for 3 pieces of luggage. They didn't charge us for the weight. They charged by the pieces. Our luggage went straight from JFK to Venice but we were told because it was a connecting flight we had to pay for them from Barcelona to Venice which did not make any sense at all. The flights were delayed going to and coming back. We didn't know that we had to order our meal and pay for it ahead of time. Can you imagine that after your flight was delayed sitting in the airport for several hours and finding out you don't have a meal? Coming back two pieces of our luggage were left behind. We were told that they only have one flight coming out of Venice so we have to wait at least 24 hrs. I will never travel with that airline again.

### "Never again, buyer beware"
Worst flight experience of my life. Its a budget airline, but it was a short haul direct flight from DUB to BCN, so I didn't really mind. The trouble started when my checked luggage didn't arrive at BCN. I followed the airport signage to the lost luggage desk and waited an hour, only to find that the lost luggage desk didn't serve Vueling airlines, and I had to go to another desk hidden way at the other end of the baggage area. The Vueling employee at that desk said she couldn't help me and pointed at a cardboard sign with a QR code to file your own lost luggage PIR report on your phone, assuming you have one. Spent the next day in BCN shopping for new clothes, suitcase, etc, as I had a cruise the following day. 2 days later, I get a call from DUB airport saying they found my bag and I gave them my PIR number. The next day the PIR report says my bag has been located and its on a flight to BCN and I'll be notified when it gets there. Guess what - it never arrived. I've called almost every day and no one can help me or give me any information. Its now been over a month, well past the 21 day limit, and they are still 'reviewing my case' and I have been unable to receive any compensation for my missing luggage. Never again, buyer beware.

### "never fly with Vueling again"
Vueling lost 1 of our 2 bags on a short flight from Barcelona to Amsterdam on July 15th. Terrible service as they are unable to do anything. Can’t claim anything until bag is in possession or after 21 days. I’ll never fly with Vueling again!

### "Choose an alternative"
Vueling lost 2 of our 3 suitcases. They were unresponsive and when replied had no information. How you can lose 2 suitcases on a hour short hop flight is unbelievable. My son was traveling to a an international volleyball completion and they lost all of his sports gear. My wife and I were taking a 4 week touring break around Spain and Portugal to celebrate my retirement. They lost all of her belongings on day one. Still heard nothing. Can’t claim anything until 21 days have passed. This airline is a joke. Choose an alternative.

### "On time in challenging operating conditions"
On time in challenging operating conditions. Kudos to Vueling for operating our flight on time yesterday during the Italian Airport worker's strike.

### "didn't allow us to cancel the tickets"
They overbooked the flight but didn't allow us to cancel the tickets. Two of us were flying but we only got 1 seat. They were not able to communicate in English and answer our questions, only kept repeating that we cannot do anything and can only wait until the end of the boarding to know if one of us will be denied boarding. Worse still is that we have a connecting flight in two hours, but there's no recommendation of a solution for our situation, they only want to make max. profit out of you and don't even bother to talk to you.

### "plane overbooked, rude staff"
Checked our family in a non existing row in the plane. Row 32 on a 31 row plane. Once at the airport had to check in again with seats all over the plane. One person to assist hundreds of people, let's say as if no one at all. Once at the gate: plane overbooked, rude staff probably fed up on handling the same situation on most flights since there was two other family in the same situation.

### "definitely use this service again"
Not Verified |  Had the best experience with Vueling Airlines and we used assistance and had the best service there. Wen got off flight straight through, staff were friendly and kind. Will definitely use this service again.

### "staff lacks knowledge"
Not Verified |  The worst experience ever. The staff lacks knowledge and language and they do not have the slightest level of politeness in dealing with customers. Imagine that you have booked two seats on the plane, then you are surprised that the employee tells you that there is only one seat, then you argue with the staff that you have reserved two seats, and time passes to come and another says to you, "Yes, you are right. You have two seats reserved" and you discover that the first employee is wrong. After that, you have to pay a large amount of baggage fees that do not fit the size of the bags. You reluctantly pay because you would like not to miss the plane. Then when the staff finishes the procedures you missed the plane and worse than that instead of apologizing for their mistake you have to pay for the flight again and the bags again. My vacation was ruined. I advise everyone not to deal with Vueling Airlines at all.

### "Won't be flying Vueling again"
Worst ground service staff ever. Rude and unfriendly. Plus you have to join the longest line at Gatwick Ground Services for a visa check if you don't have a UK passport. I had to wait in line almost an hour just to get a boarding pass because the line was for anyone who had issues, not just for visa check. Won't be flying Vueling again. The savings in ticket fare isn't worth this horrible start to a holiday.

### "my family and I felt taken advantage of
Unpleasant Experience with Vueling Airlines: Excessive and Unreasonable Baggage Charges and rude staff. Recent trip from Paris to La Coruña, Spain, the experience was far from the quality service one would expect from a prominent airline operating from one of the world's top tourist destinations. Upon arrival at the airport in Paris, I encountered an agent at the counter who seemed to lack proficiency in English or Spanish. Given Paris's global appeal, I was taken aback by the language barrier, which made communication and problem-solving unnecessarily difficult. My family and I (a group of 6) had already paid for three extra suitcases. Additionally, we had three carry-on bags that conformed to your airline's size specifications. However, the counter agent insisted we had to pay extra for each carry-on to take them onboard. The lack of effective communication compounded the frustration of this unexpected charge. Even when faced with the inconvenience of either losing what we had already paid for tickets or allowing our vacation to be marred, we chose to accommodate your airlines' demands. Thus, we agreed to pay an additional $150, albeit begrudgingly. However, to our utter surprise, we were informed the charges were actually double - $300 - due to a short layover in Barcelona. This seemed illogical and unfair as our final destination was La Coruña, and the stopover was not of our choosing. More so, our bags were to be checked directly to our final destination. Our attempts to discuss this discrepancy were ignored, leaving us no choice but to yield to these unjust charges. To further compound our disappointment, the carry-ons, for which we paid $300, were not allowed on the cabin with us but were handled as checked luggage. These bags contained valuable items not intended for stowage in the cargo hold and lacked the necessary locks for such handling. In summary, my family and I felt taken advantage of and robbed of an additional $300. Our journey was tainted by unwarranted stress and unjustified costs. We were left feeling helpless, with our only recourse being to write this review in hopes it may prevent future travelers from encountering similar or worse experiences. I urge Vueling Airlines to address these issues promptly and reconsider their approach to customer service, particularly communication and transparency regarding their policies.

### "undermines trust and confidence"
The Vueling website has proven to be deceptive and misleading, offering a false sense of economy during the ticket purchasing process. This unsettling experience unfolds when customers are denied access to the cost of their hand luggage until after they have already made the payment for their ticket. To their dismay, they are then confronted with an additional charge of +45 euros for the privilege of bringing their hand luggage on board. Such practices are both disingenuous and unfair, as customers should be provided with transparent and accurate information regarding all associated costs prior to committing to a purchase. By intentionally withholding essential details until after payment, Vueling undermines the trust and confidence of its customers, tarnishing the overall experience of using their services. In an era where consumers expect honesty and integrity from companies, this unfortunate incident highlights a severe lack of transparency on Vueling's part. To foster trust and maintain a reputable image, it is crucial for businesses to prioritize open communication and upfront disclosure of all relevant fees and charges. Potential travelers must be made aware of the hidden costs of hand luggage from the outset, allowing them to make informed decisions and avoid any unpleasant surprises. By rectifying these misleading practices and adopting a more honest approach, Vueling would not only regain the trust of its customers but also ensure a more positive and respectful customer experience.

### "my luggage did not come off the carousel"
When we arrived at Gatwick late Saturday evening, my luggage (and that of other passengers) did not come off the carousel. There was no sign of any Vueling agent, but the LGW baggage handler who was clearing the carousel said we should go through to 'landside" and report the missing bags to an office 'next to M&S'. With no Vueling agent available, we didn't really have much choice. Unfortunately, the office mentioned was closed. The next morning, I managed to speak to Vueling by phone (something I have since been unable to repeat). The customer services person clearly didn't believe me when I said there had been no Vueling agent available, and said she would need to email her supervisor. Two days later, i am still waiting to hear what they are doing to find my bag. I have been unable to speak to a person because I don't have the 'PIR' code they should have given me. They don't appear to care about me and my lost bag ! I accept Vueling is 'cheap' but to charge people extra for checked baggage, lose it, and then not help to find it is appalling.

### "my experience was terrible"
Flight was delayed. Airplane was dirty. Staff wasn’t efficient. Landing was horrible. Overall, my experience was terrible and I would not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "Shocking service"
Shocking service. Avoid this airline. Two weeks in a row I booked the 14:10 flight 19th and 26th June 2023) Both times the airline changed it to 19:15. I checked in online both times. Each time boarding was delayed. Then, both times, every person that had checked in online was not actually checked-in in the system. This meant that boarding gate staff had to manually re-check in every such person and issue them a paper ticket. Both flights eventually arrived in Barcelona after midnight compared to 17:25 per the original booking. Reason for delay; technical issues. You can say that again, but not to me. I won’t be there.

### "Vueling - Never Again!"
They knew about the flight delay for 1.5hrs before the embarkation has started (and had even sent an email notification!). But suddenly they decided to put all the people at the airplane. And after everybody got onboard they announced that we have to wait for 1.5hrs inside the plane! That's madness and shouldn't be happening in 21st century. Vueling - Never Again!

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service. We bought a ticket for a child under 2 years, which is normally not charged. Vueling incorrectly charge the cost of a seat. We asked for a refund and your answer twice is: “We cannot process refunds of products and services purchased”. So they first incorrectly charge us a cost and then they say they cannot refund us. I didn't go to school long enough to understand this.

### "need to pay 50 euro for each bag"
Absolutely terrible, arrive to check in, 13 passengers all with hand luggage under 10kg and got told we all need to pay 50 euro for each bag. We tried to refuse but were told pay or not fly. 1 lad slid his bag away unnoticed, rest of us paid 600 euro in all. Felt ripped off, the lad who slid his bag away got on plane no questions asked.

### "front lavatory solely for staff use"
Paid for a priority ticket travelling with my partner, the check-in staff didn't even look to the priority lane to motion us forward, we had to almost barge forward. The staff member took offence until I Said to her that we were waiting in the above said queue. Boarding was late, no fault of the airline or crew. Here is where it gets interesting. As soon as we boarded I needed to go to the toilet, as the terminal toilet was out of order. I asked as soon as I sat down and was told the front toilet was out of order and was told to wait until we are in the air to use the toilet at the back. Shortly after take off I saw a cabin crew member use the so called out of order toilet. To add Insult to injury the seatbelt sign was kept on way after we had levelled off. The crew were up preparing for food and drink service. As they were about to wheel the food trolley down just in front of me I asked them now a third time that I urgently needed to use the toilet. Their reply was after the meal service. I said this is the third time asking and you are doing meal service with the seatbelt sign still on. This is obviously a strategy concocted by the crew to do uninterrupted service whilst denying paying passengers the right to use the lavatories. One crew member was forcefully telling me to wait till the sign was off. Now if there was up coming turbulence then the meal and drink service would be suspended and the seatbelt sign would come on. But, to use this strategy as trick to do their little bit of work and then chat in the galley with the curtain drawn is just unacceptable. Holding your passengers captive to satisfy efficiency comes from a poor work culture and in my book is pure laziness. To keep the the front lavatory solely for staff use is unacceptable.

### "Horrible customer service"
I will never book with Vueling again. We booked a $300 ticket from Barcelona to Spain for our honeymoon. We were involuntarily booted from our flight because it was overbooked. They could not get us onto another flight for 12 hours. Our original flight was non stop but instead we got booked on a connecting flight that was 6 hours. We were not treated with kindness at all but instead they acted like they didn’t care and we were inconveniencing them. We paid for our tickets and they let people that didn’t have tickets on the plane because they were former employees and kicked us off. Absolute garbage of an airline. Horrible customer service. Do not book them unless you want to waste your whole day at the airport and get treated poorly.

### "pay €55 at the boarding gate"
I carry a Yamaha silent guitar everywhere I go. When dismantled, it occupies less than 115cm in all dimensions, which makes it suitable for hand luggage with all airlines. Not with Vueling. They made me pay €55 at the boarding gate and said it would have to go with cargo as they didn't have an instrument policy for hand luggage. I was to leave it at plane entrance. As there was no one to accept it, I took it into the plane and stored it in the overhead where it was dwarfed by some of the bags present. Cargo storage would have been disastrous. I paid €55 for nothing and had a most uncomfortable time with the manager at the boarding gate. Never again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Had a Priority ticket from Ibiza to Lisbon via Barcelona. The process at the airport with check in, luggage drop off is good and efficient. Boarding is also acceptably organized. The airplane was very dirty, obviously it is not cleaned often. The seats are uncomfortable and the pitch is very short, so for a 1,8m tall person, it is not a very good experience. Flights on time.

### "cabin bag they must pay a supplement"
After having booked and paid a supplement to have my baggage in the cabin, I was denied boarding under the pretext that a new rule now applies that the cabin baggage included in the flight is  only the size of a handbag - for the cabin bag they must pay a supplement of 60€ at the time of boarding.

### "Highly recommended"
I have flown many times with most of Europe's low cost carriers including Ryanair, Easyjet, Wizzair, Norwegian etc. This was the first time I have flown with Vueling however and I was really impressed. Of all the LCCs I have flown with I would say that they are probably the best. The neo was clean and very quiet and the on-board service was excellent. This was also the first time that our son had flown and the Captain presented him with a signed certificate to mark his first flight. This was a lovely touch and was very special indeed. I liked the fact that Vueling are using BA gates at LGW and consequently the aircraft was much closer to the security area. The aircraft also used an air bridge at both ends of the journey (rare for a low cost carrier) and the cabin was equipped with individual air vents (not always seen on new aircraft nowadays). Wi-Fi (although not free) was fast and reliable. My only observation was that the food menu could have been larger. That said, we were really impressed. Highly recommended. We would definitely choose Vueling again.

### "we were denied boarding"
The morning of our flight from BCN to Marrakech we left our hotel 5am to arrive at the airport 5:30 – plenty of time for our flight scheduled 0905. All checked in but flight gate was not posted. Arrived general boarding area and sat there with periodically checking for the gate number. The last we checked was on 0820 still no gate number but said will be posted 30min prior to boarding; checked again 0835 then saw the gate number posted. We run to the gate surprisingly on the other side of the general boarding area, when we got there informed the door was closed. Imagine you’re sitting feet away from the boarding gate this whole time. We were trying to make a point about lack of announcement and not posting gate number until the last minute of the flight – this should have been responsibility of the airline; but we were denied boarding it was too late for us. Afterwards we went to Vueling window to rebook our flight – we were told space available in two days and our ticket and luggage charges are non-refundable Suddenly, we found ourselves stranded - we ended up purchasing one way ticket to Marrakech with a different airline

### "cabin crew was totally nonchalant"
It’s like lightning striking twice when the exact previous comment was also a complaint about “what’s the point of having Priority Boarding?”, because paying for the Space Plus seats, Priority Boarding and overhead cabin bag space turned out to be a complete farce. As such there was no difference being in Boarding Group 1 and by the time we got to our seats the baggage bins were completely full. The cabin crew was totally nonchalant and did nothing about it despite clearly being aware of the situation. What a complete waste of €70. If there was any consolation to go by, the crew got the aircraft airborne really quickly and we landed ahead of schedule. Bags didn’t go missing either but that’s where the positives end.

### "What's the point of paying extra for priority boarding"
What's the point of paying extra for priority boarding if when it's time everyone is called to board at the same time? Practices like that are just a rip off.

### "didn’t inform me of cancellation"
Flight was scheduled this Friday April 28th around 10:30 am, was surprised not having received email for check in etc so checked their site, flight cancelled and they offer a flight tomorrow Thursday 27th at around 7:30pm, I was not informed of flight cancelled by Vueling. Had to cancel plans for tomorrow day and night in Malta, I lose out on one night hotel already paid here in Malta, had to cancel my transport from Paris to home and book another (twice the price) AND I have to book a hotel in Paris tomorrow as arriving too late. All this done last minute as Vueling didn’t inform me of cancellation. Appalling. They have cost me a fortune in changes and I lose out on one day holiday and money spent.

### "Customer service extremely unhelpful"
Not Verified | Bag damaged on flight, and not possible to file PIR at London Gatwick due to no counter available. Customer service extremely unhelpful. I tried to explain to them that the Lost and Found counter and Gatwick refused to file my complaint as they only dealt with lost luggage and not damaged bags

### "everything was fine"
I approached this flight with skepticism, since I have had bad experiences with Vueling in the past, but apart from little leg space, everything was fine. The flight was on time, drinks and food for purchase average for low budget carriers, and staff were nice and attentive. So will consider them perhaps again in the future.

### "shame of a company"
Not Verified | No information on flight cancellation, despite Vueling has phone numbers and email addresses. Informed only at the airport by airport staff. No Vueling attendance at the Airport, no information of any kind from Vueling. No solution given, no basic respect for the customer, treated just like cattle. A shame of a company.

### "Terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. Not only overbooked our flight but also that of the next days as well. They didn’t compensate me for the return flight either. Will never book through this airline again, I should’ve known since everyone has talked so badly about it. Lesson learned.

### "eligible to a meal at the airport"
Not Verified |  I paid 244 dollars for a ticket from Amsterdam to Barcelona. Instead of leaving at 7.15am the flight leaves at 10.25am because they said they were trying to replace 2 crew members who fell ill last minute. The guy at the gate counter (who only showed up at around 9am) said that because of the delay, I was supposedly eligible to a meal at the airport. Upon trying to make a purchase in 3 different locations, no credit reflected on my ticket. When I asked about it at the gate, they said I should call the customer service line, which I tried, but as it's all automated, and my inquiry does not reflect in the automated options, there was no luck getting the voucher/discount. I then asked about an email but they couldn't provide me with one and I was told to approach the Vueling desk in Barcelona. The cabin crew was polite and as a low-cost airline they do not offer beverages or food unless you pay for it. Once in Barcelona, I stood an hour in line at the customer service desk. The agent said that they don't do returns or vouchers on delays under 5 hours. That I could check online for my options. This trip was a waste of time and cost too much for the service I was provided.

### "I will never fly with Vueling again"
The worst service! The most embarrassing airline in the world! We paid €478 each for a flight from Bilbao to Milan with €140 of luggage each and for not dispatching it, they made us pay €120 more one way! They did not give us the receipt because the machine was not working. I will never fly with Vueling again on principle. El peor servicio! La aerolínea mas vergonzosa del mundo! Pagamos 478€ cada uno por un vuelo de Bilbao a Milan con 140€ de equipaje cada uno y por no despacharlo, nos hicieron pagar 120€ mas solo de ida! No nos dieron el recibo porque la máquina no funcionaba. Nunca mas volare con Vueling por principio.

### "will not fly with them anymore"
Within 2 weeks I have had the unfortunate experience of flying with Vueling connecting through Barcelona with other cities. On both occasions the initial flight has left 3 hours late and I have lost the connection for 10 minutes. Apparently due to problems with the construction of a new track in Barcelona combined with strikes by European controllers. So far, bad luck, it happens in the best families. But what defines companies and people in how they manage difficulties. Leaving aside the flight staff, who have always been very professional, I have not been able to speak to anyone from Vueling, they have all been Iberia staff "on loan" to Vueling. Impossible to talk on the phone with anyone other than a machine that, based on typing options, puts you in a circle of options whose final output is to refer you to the web, never to a person. When you try the web, the experience is similar, but nobody solves the problem, just send a message and we'll see. (I'm still waiting for an answer from my first flight). Today, stuck in Barcelona, ​​I've been in 4 queues for 1 hour each, at this time I should be at home but I'm saving the 5th queue of the day, because the hotel they gave me only has one check-in person when there are 100 of us those of us who have missed the flight. The drama of all this is that I knew that I was losing the connection, then vueling too, but I imagine that the artificial intelligence that seems to manage Vueling was on Saturday and the intelligence was off. What an embarrassing airline. If I can avoid it I will not fly with them anymore. En le plazo de 2 semanas he tenido la desafortunada experiencia que e volar con Vueling conectando por Barcelona con tras ciudades. En ambas ocasiones el vuelo incial ha salido con 3 horas de retraso y he perdido la conexion por 10 minutos. Segun parece por problemas de construcción de una nueva pista en Barcelona combinado con huelgas de controladores europeos. Hasta aqui, mala suerte, pasa en las mejores familias. Pero lo que define a empresas y personas en como gestionan las dificultades. Dejando aparte al personal de vuelo que siempre ha sido may profesional, no he podido hablar con nadie de vueling, todo han sido personal de Iberia “cedido” a vueling. Imposible hablar por telefono con nadie que no sea una maquina que a base de teclear opciones te mete en un circulo de opciones cuya salida final es remitirte a la web, nunca a una persona. Cuando intentas la web, la experiencia es similar , pero nadie te solventa el problema solo manda un mensaje y ya veremos. (de mi primer vuelo aun espero respuesta). Hoy, atrapado en Barcelona, llevo 4 colas cada una de 1 hora, a estas horas debería estar en mi casa pero estoy guard ado la 5a cola del día, pq el hotel a me han dado solo tiene una persona de check in cuando somos 100 los q henos perdido el vuelo. El drama de todo esto es que yo sabia que perdía la conexión, luego vueling también, pero me imagino que la inteligencia artificial que parece gestionar Vueling estaba de sabado y la inteligencia de descanso. Que verguenza de aerolinea. Si puedo evitarlo no volare mas con ellos.

### "On time. Lovely staff"
On time. Lovely staff. Luggage arrived on time there and back. Really happy as I am a very anxious flyer. We had bike boxes and another hold bag and the service was speedy and stress free.

### "Terrible service and airline"
Not Verified |  We had a flight from Paris to Genoa. The flight was canceled without any warning, we didn't even receive an email, we just learned it while checking in. As provided for in European Regulation No. 261/2004 we are entitled to a ticket refund, as well as a compensation for 250 euros, but it is impossible to have it. They do not answer their our calls, on their website we should "check-in" to be able to get it but it is impossible to do so because the flight was canceled. Terrible service and airline. We lost lots of money (hotel reservation) just by choosing them. Never Again.

### "no free random seats available"
When I was about to do the Check-in there were no free random seats available. The only available seats were the ones I had to pay for. So I had to pay 17 euros (the cheapest one) in order to be able to do the check-in and get a boarding pass. This is a fraud since when you buy the ticket they say that you can have a random seat for free. They don't know what to do so as to get extra money at the expense of clients.

### "doesn't care about their customers"
I forgot a cabin bag in a Vueling Flight travelling from Basel to Barcelona on 21st October. My luggage was found by Vueling cabin personnel and was disembarked from the aircraft, however, Vueling never returned my luggage to me. It is impossible to contact any person at Vueling. All the interaction with Vueling is done through a service called "Vueling Foundspot" Although the flight was good, the crew very friendly and overall experience very enjoyable, the company doesn't care about their customers They never contacted me and my bag lost. It was impossible to talk to any person at Vueling that could provide assistance.

### "shouldn't be allowed to operate"
This airline shouldn't be allowed to operate. After waiting 3 hours at the gate we were told the airplane was faulty and they were cancelling the flight. We were sent to the information desk where they told us to book a replacement flight ourselves at their expense. They told us that we would receive full compensation for any expenses including hotel and food. They also said they would pay us back within 7 days. 3 months later, I (and many others who were on the same flight) am still waiting for £400. Despite many calls and emails, they refuse to communicate. I have contacted the CAA who said they can't help. I've contacted the Citizens Advice Bureau but they said they can't help as Vueling are governed by Spanish law, not UK.

### "the worst I have experienced"
Vueling customer service is the worst I have experienced. They simply do not care about their customers and only want to make a quick buck. I was supposed to fly with my pregnant wife, two-year-old son, and mom. We got to the airport nearly 2 hours early, went through security, found our gate, and waited for the majority of the people to board. Then went into line once it was shorter, and when we reached the boarding gate they told us there is no space and that they sold our tickets to the people in front of us. This was the end of our trip. They then lost our bag and offered us and their customer service offered us a slight two days later which was expensive and we had to pay for. I still do not understand how this could happen - how can a business like this exist when they screw over families during their travels. We travel several times a year. I have never experienced such poor service. The staff was simply instructed to cut us off at any point and tell us to leave the airport.

### "Never again with Vueling for us"
Flight LPA-CDG VY 3184 on 25/11/2022 Departure time: 13:15. Very bad crew experience- flight from LPA (Gran Canaria) to CDG (Paris) VY 3184 - Not professional crew. 25/11/22. No catering on board for more than 4 hour flight. We had no information of that before the flight. If we had information we could buy a sandwich before the flight. I felt very bad, like I was going to faint, because I did not eat nothing in the morning and I was supposed to eat on board. The attitude of the cabin crew was not acceptable: 1st: they said to us that we had the info about the catering before the flight (we did no have it). 2nd: The cabin crew and the senior cabin crew were eating their meals in front of us in the galley and laughing, during this time and we had nothing to eat. 3rd: the cabin crew at the front had a friend in the flight and thy were talking every time with him loudly and laughing in the galley. This is not a good professional attitude. Moreover, the cabin crew at the back had an aggressive way to talk with passengers, he seemed bored to be here. Shame on him. Never again with Vueling for us. We like to go often to Canaria, and to Europe but we'll never take this company. We’ll take a real company with an experienced and trained crew, not this Vueling bus without crew in the cabin. Vueling should train their cabin crew about the behaviour to have on board and the way to talk with passengers. And the cabin crew should understand that we paid for a service and they are here because there is passengers paying. So we are paying them.

### "I had to pay as a result of their mistake"
Not Verified |  This airline is a scam. I purchased a ticket for a weekend trip with a friend. I had done this multiple days in advance, checked in, got my boarding pass, and even made it through security. While waiting at my gate I received an email that my booking was canceled, my booking not the flight. Even though I had a seat number and assurances from multiple employees that this was a mistake when I went to get on the flight I had been removed from the manifest with no explanation. After an initial call to Vueling headquarters, the people helping me were no longer able to get a response and I was left to go home with my entire trip canceled and the charge for the flight still on my card. While I was able to get the money for the flight back they will not cover any other expenses such as transport to the airport or cancellation fees I had to pay as a result of their mistake. The trip was also overbooked by around 8 people leaving me to believe they dropped me to make room for others.

### "Overbooked and denied boarding"
Overbooked and denied boarding. After 5 hours wait, I got to the hotel with other 6 people. Compensation form fully automatic, eventually received a link after 1 month. But the link contains the wrong name. At this point it is impossible to contact Vueling. Just impossible to find an automatic answer within their automatic call center. I have already lost 1 hour of time trying .

### "never flying with Vueling again"
Not Verified |  We went to fly with vueling and had checked in luggage. When we arrived at Malaga our luggage was no where to be found. They told us we could buy necessities for up to 50 euros a day as we didn’t have anything with us now for our holidays. It is now two months later and they are still “searching” for our luggage. Above all we now also have to decide between either getting a claim for the lost luggage or getting a claim for the money we spend on necessities during our holidays. Not both. The amount of the claim will be based on the weight of our luggage, which is an insane way of calculating the worth of our valuable personal items. Costumer service is horrible, as if they are trying to make it as difficult als possible to claim anything for them. I feel horrible about losing my personal belongings, but feeling scammed makes it even worse. I’m never flying with Vueling again and would advise against everyone.

### "Classical overbooking of an earlier flight"
Classical overbooking of an earlier flight to "pre-sell" tickets on a later flight with a less desirable time. When you try to check in early, they ask to pay for a seat or else they would refuse early check in. The app is confusing: when I tried to check-in early, it said that only a limited number of random seats are available (zero in my case) or choose a sear for a fee. The third option in an upper yellow box is go to the airport check-in. We were literally the first to arrive at the check-in and...entire flight was booked out. Stay in tune for my experience with their customer service trying to reclaim 2x250 euros compensation per EU regulations.

### "So disappointed and angry"
Not Verified |  Purchased my ticket at vueling.com and they booked me using Iberia. Now Iberia canceled the flight and they informed me but neither airline would refund my money. I have 6 passengers on that booking and they ripped us off. Tried requesting a refund on their web but they would refer us to Iberia while Iberia would do the same. Iberia said vueling have our money so they should refund it not Iberia. So disappointed and angry.

### "mandatory masks on board"
Terrible Service. Very uncoordinated at the gates and mandatory masks on board, but it was not enforced. Had to spend money on masks at the airport after being denied boarding because of no mask.

### "only recommend at a last resort"
Got to the check-in desk and gave in our passports and tickets, four of each. Explained that we had booked the extra seats, an option that is clearly available for anyone booking with Vueling on their website NOT on the app that I am aware of. The lady at the desk got told to off load the extra seats! We questioned this and was told by the queue supervisor that it was ok and we would keep all the seats. When we got to the boarding gate we checked again and they had no idea you could do this, one of the person's checking the tickets at the gate just turned round to her colleague and said I haven't checked anyone in, again another example of lack or good service as you could tell they didn't care and was told to check with the staff. As we boarded the plan we could see that Vueling had resold our seats. We explained to the crew that we had paid for the extra seats, not their fault but they didn't understand. We took our seats but still have lost our extra seat. The crew are trying to work it out and get and outcome to everyone's satisfaction. Then the captain came out of the cockpit and aggressively pointing at us making it clear to everyone on the plane that we had raised and issue regarding seating. After another number finger points and some none helpful words (as people do understand other languages), they decided to move the extra people to the row behind. No formal apology was given just a lot of looks and finger pointing. Just before we pulled back we were still waiting for 2 other passengers who were clearly late, but the captain made an announcement on the tannoy and clearly claimed that the very little (6 mins) delay of the plane was down to the seat problem (mainly that we had caused this problem) making it look like we had caused the problem. As soon as the late passengers turn up and sat down we were on our way, so I don't think our seat problem caused any delay. There was no visible checking of seatbelts and where bags were placed on the plane. After take off the crew the crew quickly closed of the front curtains and toilets. Such bad customer service. No comfort in the seats. Is Vueling the company I would choose for future traveling, probably not and probably would only recommend at a last resort and choice.

### "I will pay extra next time to ensure I do not fly with Vueling again"
Unbelievably bad airline. They were understaffed at check in, and we waited in line for over 3 hours to check in (online check in was also not working). Then they lost my luggage. After jumping through all the hoops and filling out all the forms, they emailed saying they are "processing". It has been over 2 months since the claim was submitted, and they still have not provided compensation. They will not respond to emails, or answer phone calls. Awful company. I will pay extra next time to ensure I do not fly with Vueling again.

### "Impossible to claim the refund for expenses"
Impossible to claim the refund for expenses due to the cancellation of my flight. They sent me an email recalling my right to obtain refund upon presentation of receipts relating to meals, accommodation, transportation etc.. After spending a very long time trying to find the right section on their website and calling their customer support, I haven't managed to get someone from the support. I only get a robot chat or a robot voice with no answer for my request. It's clear all is made so that it's impossible for me to claim back those refunds.

### "Disgusting service"
Not Verified |  Disgusting service. The airline overbooked and we weren't allowed to fly because of that. How is this even allowed? The lady who was checking us in laughed about it and wished us luck? Disgusting. I would rather pay a lot more but fly with a decent service rather than use this company ever again.

### "I don't recommend using them"
This flight seems to be delayed almost every day and my flight was 1 hour late taking off. Swissport did a really poor job of boarding there were lines all over the place and no directions. Boarding unlike Ryanair was only through the front door and took 20 minutes or more. Then they couldn't start the engines without a boost which took 30 minutes. Arrival was through an air bridge but still very slow. I don't recommend using them on this route.

### "Do not recommend for any reason"
Flight was overbooked, and we had to stay in Athens overnight. They code share with Iberia and seats are booked on first come first served base. No telephone or email to support with a live agent! Lucky for us an employee from Athens Airport reached them and if all is well maybe we can fly tomorrow, Do not recommend for any reason

### "have to apply for an invoice separately"
They do not provide you with an Invoice upon purchase of the ticket, you have to apply for an invoice separately. That is totally ridicules. an invoice can be generated automatically the same moment you purchase. When you have found the site where you have to apply for an invoice they even want 48 hours to send you one. The 48 hours have long come and gone, and i still don't have an invoice. Guess you will have to apply for an invoice every day until they finally send you one. I'm still waiting for mine.

### "not fly with this airline again"
Not Verified |  Awful experience. Plane was late leaving UK and returning with no explanation at check in. Both ways we had a very long wait (no seating) whilst waiting for the gate to open. We had a 4 year old with us but were not offered a complimentary bottle of water and drinks on board the plane were extortionate. Will not fly with this airline again.

### "The worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. Imagine you have bought flight ticket, you have bought Louvre museum ticket, Disneyland Park, and you have paid your Hotel, then when you are at the gate to flight, after 3 hours of delay, airline informs you that flight is cancelled.

### "not allowed onboard as a cabin bag"
The airline has no clear/fair policy about the cabin/underseat bag - my bag was not allowed onboard as a cabin bag even though it has the "permitted" size. Many other passengers have bigger bags/suitcases. Some had more than 1. Flight delays are recurrent, no communication, no apologies. 45-min delays in my last 2 flights. This is unacceptable!

### "Flight attendants were strange"
Not Verified |  Sat in front row, one and a half hour flight from Ibiza to FCO. Flight attendants were strange. They did one beverage cart run for full flight, when that emptied (1/8 of the passengers), they came back up to front galley, closed curtain so passengers got the message they were closed, bathrooms not available, etc. Then some lovely warm pasta smell began emanating from the front (likely a crew meal). They laughed and chatted with curtain blocking both passage and window barrier in front of 1A-C.

### "On time departure, early arrival"
Smooth check in at Brussels Airport and despite departing on a very busy day, the whole airport experience was smooth. On time boarding and greeted by the friendly cabin crew while on board. Emergency exit seat was assigned and was very appreciated. Ample legroom making sure the flight was very comfortable. Drinks/snacks for purchase as well as Wi-Fi bundle to choose from and worked pretty good. On time departure, early arrival. Overall, excellent.

### "totally disillusioned with Vueling"
For our last holiday my wife wanted to go to Paris before it was it was impossible due to ill health. We booked Newcastle to Paris return with Vueling. On the Orly to Newcastle return we arrived on time, seen flight cancelled. Went to check in and told no problem and come back in one hour for correct check in time. Went back and told the flight was cancelled. We asked for help from the Vueling desk, they looked at my phone and found the flight was cancelled at 02.30 in morning. We were not up then. She told me we were booked the next day to Gatwick not Newcastle. We asked for help with hotels, phone, food, nothing but told book with Air France to get to Newcastle. We were at the airport my wife who is 74 years old and attends a memory clinic and I have severe hearing loss with 2 hearing aids and heart problems, she is my wonderful ears and I am her guide to keep her from wandering off as she loses direction. I had to get us from Orly to Charles de Gaulle book a hotel and to our check in the morning after. Sounds simple, you try it deaf with anxiety off the scale. After 10 emails, complaints about treatment they put 148 pound in our bank. Not acceptable, the flight alone cost 500. They give me some reason of weather problems. The one thing I would like to say that young French people are wonderful and helped us many times in the holiday. We were totally disillusioned with Vueling and their CEO Marco who we contacted twice with no response. But congratulations on the profits you make from peoples misery and upset. I did cheekily suggest to him to save money was to sack all customer service and put in an automated answer phone in saying do not bother we will not pay out fair compensation. Please do not do that. Clearly they are only following policy which comes from the top and they followed company policy regardless of how they really feel. Do not let old age and health problems stop booking flights, get the correct insurance with a good airline and you can a have a wonderful holiday.

### "embarrassing and overwhelming"
Not Verified |  Waited in line for an hour to check in. Really not a big deal as I was expecting this. While in line, they checked my passport quickly which I thought was strange. When I finally got to the front of the line, I could not check in because my passport didn’t have a sticker that was apparently supposed to have been given to me. I was escorted out of line back to security in front of everyone where I was treated like =garbage. The man denied having ever seen me in line and they tried to make me go to the back. I got worked up naturally, and they turned it around as if I was being disrespectful. It was incredibly embarrassing. When I was taken back to check in, the man kept telling me to smile and was laughing in French with his friend about it the situation. This was highly embarrassing and overwhelming and there was no reason for it to be.

### "worst experience ever"
Not Verified | Barcelona to London. Outrageous. I flew to Barcelona from London for a weekend and it was the worst experience ever. My flight from London to Barcelona was delayed by 4h 20min. It was a weekend trip, so that’s a lot of time lost to enjoy your destination. The flight was at 8am, so I woke up at 5am to be at the airport with ample time. They didn’t bother to let us know; not an email, nothing. They just sent an email AT 10:24 telling us that the 8am flight was delayed — ehm, thanks, I did notice indeed that I am not flying right now. Thanks for nothing… They HAVE to, by regulation, give you reasonable food while waiting. Well, they sent an email 2h after departure time saying that you can have food via a £5 voucher. Firstly, £5 at Gatwick buys you nothing, not even a sandwich. Secondly, the email link saying in which stores you can use it was broken. And thirdly, when I actually tried to use said voucher in two stores, they said that you need to go print the boarding pass at a specific place and then have it sealed by some random people. No instructions whatsoever about this in the email. So dishonest of the airline to try that way that you do not spend YOUR ENTITLED BY REGULATION money. Finally, the flight back — I was denied boarding at the gate because I had arrived 5min after they closed the boarding. The interesting thing is (1) I arrived with ample time, and (2) they did not, in a single email or communication, specify any time at which the boarding would close. In addition, the staff at the gate were incredibly rude. Really, really, do not fly with them. They made my experience miserable of what could’ve been an otherwise enjoyable weekend with friends.

### "I cannot believe I trusted them"
Do not fly with Vueling. They oversell tickets and my partner does not have a seat. We have to rearrange our schedules and pay so much more and miss out on my partners sisters wedding. I am beyond disgusted I cannot believe I trusted them.

### "cancelled flight an hour before boarding"
After going through security, the airline cancelled flight an hour before boarding. Went to the airline desk to be assisted and there was no one from Vueling airline to assist. We had to wait an hour for someone to take us back to landside, went to find someone from Vueling landside to assist but there were no staff available to assist and the lady at the info desk advised to call the airline customer service instead. A complete nightmare. We had to buy additional ticket with another company, and we never succeed to have the customer services, either online or hotline, for a compensation or refund.

### "they have lost our luggage"
Not Verified |  Flew into Dublin arriving at 6am for our connecting bought ticket flight on Vueling at 1:40pm! thinking we had TONS of time to check luggage. Dublin airport does not have Permanent desk check in counters for their airlines, they all share desks. So no one with the airline you are flying other than BA and Ryan have desks you can speak to anyone. Was told where Vueling might Be but not until 10:30 am, we had no way to check bags early. We stood in line at 9:15 to ensure we were first in line waiting to see Where Vueling might be. when it tells you counter 11, that means the Entire counter which is really 3 airlines long and shared by all. For our 1:40 flight, which Vueling recommends 3-4 hr early check in, one lone lady shows up at 10:45 to post the Vueling sign on two monitors! she then says, someone will be here in 10 min to start check in. 35 min later not 10, ONE lady/girl shows up to check in the entire flight! Now being the very first customer we are being checked in at 11:30 for a 1:40 flight, less than their own company recommendation! Being the first customer to check in bags,  they have lost our luggage for a 2hr flight Dublin to Paris. One man at customer service who spoke broken English, filed our claim and told us to call back. We are now 48hrs from our flight and there is no calling. the phone is permanently off hook and busy. we have emailed and gone on Vueling customer service with no response. Because Vueling has super strict online luggage rules, we believed them and put Everything in our paid checked bags. NO help is anywhere from Vueling. Having to spend money on brand new shower items, make up and at this point, we now have to ruin our holiday more, go shop in Paris for clothing which of course are quite expensive!

### "Absolutely totally untrustworthy"
Not Verified |  Booked through BA. Cancelled flight a couple of hours before flight by email. Email said clearly choice is to rebook or claim a refund within 7 days. Tried to claim a refund and they said down to adverse weather so doesn't qualify. (Not a cloud in the sky). Absolutely totally untrustworthy. Pay a few quid more and go with a proper airline. Can't believe British Airways thrown their lot in with this shower.

### "compensation was declined"
I've flown with Vueling twice. As long as there are no issues, they're fine. But once the plane was over 4h late and I tried to get in touch with the airline to get compensation as I missed my train and had to pay for a hotel night in Paris. It was impossible to get a hold of anybody. And my request for compensation was declined. So as long as you don't have to get in touch with them it's fine, but if something goes wrong, you're screwed.

### "cancel flight an hour before boarding"
Not Verified |  After going through security the airline decided to cancel flight an hour before boarding. Went to the airline desk to be assisted and there was no one from Vueling airline to assist. We had to wait an hour for someone to take us back to landside, went to find someone from Vueling landside to assist but there were no staff available to assist and the lady at the info desk advised to call the airline customer service instead. A complete nightmare. Eventually after we got through to a real person on the phone they could not help and kept referring us to the Vueling website! Do not book with the airline and avoid if you can.

### "definitely use Vueling in future"
Best check in in many year, efficient staff and took me 10 min. For the price €84 the seat can be uncomfortable but service is excellent. Will definitely use Vueling in future!

### "Insufficient check in staff"
Worst airline ever. Insufficient check in staff at Gatwick (2-4 staff for 12 check in counters) meant police got involved in crowd control, Several people, including families bumped due to overbooking. Flight was 5 hours late, landing at 04:45. Vueling customer service non-existent for claiming compensation

### "do not fly with them"
Barcelona to Santiago de Compostela. Worst airline in Spain, I always have a problem with them. Today my flight is delayed 2h and I will arrive at 1 am. Other times they started the check-in of the baggage 50 min before the flight and things like this. They are terrible - do not fly with them.

### "Over an hour later than scheduled we took off. Never again"
Not Verified |  It would appear that Ryanair have produced a race to the bottom business model that Vueling are winning if that is even possible. I would love to be a fly on the wall at the strategy meetings of this venal money grabbing smug business. The whole experience is designed to get you into such a state of anxiety by bamboozling you into buying seats, insurance, extra baggage and customer care you don't need just on the off chance you are stung with exorbitant charges. They then pile on the incompetence by doing things such as sending confirmation to an entirely made up email address and not showing the baggage you have shelled out for on any of your booking information. I finally managed to get my boarding passes by having a toe in the moonlight and one burning eyebrow and promising them custody of my first born. Once inside Gatwick airport we were faced with a queue that snaked around the terminal. You then shuffle along until a panicked Vueling employee on a minimal wage calls you to skip the line as your flight is about to take off rendering the two hours you put aside for baggage check-in entirely pointless. We then had to leg it to the gate to be faced with a "Gate Closed" sign and absolutely nobody there. At which point my youngest burst into tears. No worries though. Vueling had simply sent the other 200 or so passengers to the wrong gate. Result. Next stroke of luck, we were not thrown off the flight due to overbooking seats. That fell to some other poor passengers. Over an hour later than scheduled we took off. Never again.

### "told there is no seat for you"
Not Verified |  How can this company take your money for a flight then when you check in, to be told there is no seat for you. Then take no responsibility. So our holiday is ruined as they don’t offer an alternative flight because they overbook seats and assume a certain amount of people are not going to turn up for their flight. They say you can wait for the next flight but they do this for every flight, so you won’t get on the next one either. Very poor customer service and they should be closed down.

### "I am stranded at the airport"
Awful experience. I basically paid money for torture. Flight was delayed indefinitely, they told us “no plane, no pilot” and I am stranded at the airport. I have wasted an entire day from my precious trip. None of the communication made by the airline thus far was satisfactory. Bottom line: pay a little more such that you get an airline that will actually give you a plane. My flight and hotel money have gone to waste.

### "customer service is so poor"
Not Verified |  My cousin flew on a flight from Barcelona to Geneva and at some point we realized it got redirected. We called their customer service line, which is designed to be fully automated, and once I finally got in contact with an actual person and asked if they have any information on my cousin's flight they wanted to know the flight's number. I don't memorize these numbers so I asked him to wait while I find it. He graciously waited 30 seconds. 30 seconds of waiting and then he tells me that if I don't have the number then he will have to hang up in order to serve other customers. After saying that, he doesn't wait for my response, tells me to kindly do a survey, and hangs up the phone. I understand that there are other customers, I understand that there will be other people calling this airline to find out about their friends or family that were on the same flight as my cousin but I cannot believe that 30 seconds was too much of a wait time. This airline may provide cheap fares but their customer service is so poor you really shouldn't expect anything.

### "cancelled due to a mechanical issue"
Not Verified |  By far the worst traveling experience I ever had. Flight was cancelled due to a mechanical issue of the airplane. Next available flight was set 8 hours later, which was delayed one hour. We got 12 euros as a refund, and that was all. I wouldn't suggest to fly with this company

### "They just want more and more money from you"
On my inbound flight I was able to add a cabin luggage during my online check-in. So I went to my trip with a cabin luggage. But on my outbound trip this option was not available. I had then to buy a checked bag. In the beginning the 15kg bag was 20 EUR, then on the check-out it went to 31 EUR, after a refresh the price was 26 EUR, and at the end I paid 31EUR for 15 checked luggage, instead of 12eur for a cabin luggage. My ticket cost 200EUR which of course is far from being low-cost. But the offered service is really cheap. They just want more and more money from you. I do not recommend this company and will not take it again. Very short legroom and dirty plane.

### "Vueling is the worst airline"
Ticket re paid three times! On the morning of April 6, 2022, I arrive at Fiumicino airport with my return ticket for las Palmas paid 400 euros. The hostesses tell me that the ticket shows my first name repeated two times (name/name) not my first and last name. Although I paid for it with my credit card there is nothing to do for the company. I can only change the name by spending 500 euros, or buy a new ticket for 400 euros. I am ready to go, I have already paid for the hotel so I choose to buy a new ticket. I pay 490 euros, the hostesses tell me that it is the same return ticket like the first one, and they tell me to rush towards the boarding area. at the Gate the hostesses assure me again that the ticket is round trip and that I will receive the rest of tags once in Spain. But in Spain I will have a nasty surprise. the connection Barcelona to Las Palmas is overbooked and I will be boarded by a miracle and as last Passenger despite being the owner of two seats on that plane! After two days spent on the phone trying to talk to someone from Vueling, I discover that the replacement ticket sold to me at the check in in Rome is one way ticket! Ruined vacation for the first two days and uncertain mood for the remaining days looking for a return flight that wasn't too expensive. Total cost 1000 euros only for the flights of the Vueling; an additional hotel day + airport parking + lunch, dinner + airport lunch + extra = 150 euros. In total 750 euros more spent. 750 euros that I could have saved or spent to better enjoy the holiday. I could also have had a calmer, more relaxed attitude. For me Vueling is the worst airline in the world based on my experience. I have never had such a bad and depressing experience with an airline. They don't even give you a glass of water on board. The bathroom was dirty. the ground staff is absent if no physical person answers the phone.

### "amazingly bad customer service"
My recent flight with Vueling was the worst flying experience of my life. I paid £795 for 2 adults and a child to fly one-way from Rome to Gatwick. This is a lot of money for such a terrible service. We paid extra for row 3 "More space plus" - this includes extra luggage allowance in the overhead bin & priority boarding. The priority boarding just didn't happen. As a result, we boarded about halfway through the process, and as we joined, every single overhead locker was full until row 10. However, on closer inspection, around 1/3 of these bags did not have yellow "approved" overhead locker tags on them, they were just the bags that should be stowed under the seat, but lazy passengers had just stored them in the bins. There was no monitoring or policing of the bin policy by any of the cabin crew, so this led to huge amounts of aggravation from all the passengers (like me) who had paid £30 extra for overhead luggage storage but now could not access it. The cabin crew were lazy, rude and surly. The 4 cabin crew "hid" behind their curtain at the front of the plane for the majority of the flight, laughing and giggling and ignored their customers for at least 75% of the journey. When passengers tried to access the front of the plane, the cabin crew held the curtain closed so the passengers couldn't get in. The food and beverage service started 25 minutes after the seatbelt lights had gone off. I was in Row 3, the crisps/snacks had already run out before they even got to me. The crew stopped people from using the front toilet (even when the light was green and the toilet was unoccupied), sending them to the back of the plane. It was truly amazingly bad customer service.

### "no bags were loaded onto the plane"
Vueling reported after landing that no bags were loaded onto the plane in Florence. Same for flight 6206, the previous flight that day. They claimed a wind incident at the airport. They claimed an overloaded flight, half the seats on A319 were empty. We filled out the requisite forms at the British Airways desk in Gatwick (they partner with Vueling and BA has the only terminal office for Vueling). The BA agent agreed that Vueling is horrible. Received one text message acknowledging our PIR number. Checking online shows that they are searching for our bags. Calling in to Vueling is a horrible experience. I could only find a human by mistake on the phone tree. The agent was the worst I have ever encountered. She would only tell me that the bags were not found yet. No bags loaded at the Florence airport and they don't know where they are? She told me that she could not connect me to a supervisor. She would not pass our case or contact info to a supervisor. A complete stonewall job. 2 days and no bags, no news.

### "Shame on Vueling for providing such a poor service"
Terrible airline with one of the most arrogant and unprofessional customer services I've ever experienced. I was going to work during the flight, I purchased some extra options to have a front seat, and to enjoy priority boarding. First, the boarding process at Alicante airport was a mess. When I entered the plane, it turned out that all overhead compartments in the front are full. It looked like most of the luggage belonged to the crew. The crew told me in a very arrogant way to store my hand luggage in the rear of the cabin (my seat was in the front row). Second, for most of the flight all the crew stayed in the front galley, giggling and chatting. They stowed the curtain, and closed the front lavatory to keep privacy. Lastly, the disembarkment was a mess. Okay, they announced that because of Covid passengers must leave the aircraft row by a row. But they didn’t care how the disembarkment actually looked like. I need look just like the boarding – a total mess. Shame on Vueling for providing such a poor service.

### "the worst customer service"
Vueling may have the worst customer service of any airline. I booked my flight incredibly carefully at Vueling.com, only to arrive at a confirmation page that had me flying on a totally different route than I had selected with a totally different time (like completely different origin and destination city and not even the same day). There was clearly a glitch with the booking, and I tried to contact Vueling call center only to find it closed. When I called back a few hours later and their call center was open, they refused to cancel or refund my reservation since "no website incident was documented" and since it had been more than 2 hours since I booked the flight. They did not care that their call center was closed which made it impossible to reach them within 2 hours of booking online. I am now out about 100 Euros because of a stupid glitch on Vueling's website which they refuse to acknowledge or offer support around. They claim I had to contact them within 2 hours of the booking (a ridiculously short window of time) despite the fact that their call center was closed within the 2 hour window. The only "solution" they offer you is to file a complaint on their website, which is literally a chat bot. If the situation weren't so unethical and clearly just an attempt for a company to rip off a customer, it might actually be somewhat comical at how bad they are at addressing even the most basic of mistakes.

### "A very cheap product in general"
Unacceptable policy for damaged luggage: since they don’t have partners for replacement of the damaged suitcases to all their destinations, Vueling imposes to passengers whose luggage is found damaged on arrival a reimbursement limited to only 50 euros, regardless the type, size and price of the baggage concerned. Bad value for money too: a rough low-cost service at a not necessarily low-cost price. A very cheap product in general.

### "All in all a bad experience"
What a horrible experience. The check in wouldn’t work for days, documents didn’t get validated and you can only take under seat luggage?! I bought a combination ticket, so it wasn’t an option or explained that you had to pay extra for cabin luggage if at all there is that option. And not cheap either! I ended up having to check in my cabin baggage twice, so in the end this airline isn’t even cheaper. The check in literally took me hours because it didn’t accept the reservation code and the customer service doesn’t respond and reverts you back into the loop of not being able to contact Vueling directly. When arriving at the airport it took me another hour check in as there were hundreds of people and only 4 counters - ridiculous. I must admit the plane and chairs were ok, what you can expect for a cheaper airline. All in all a bad experience, will never travel with Vueling again.

### "still waiting for a refund"
I am still waiting for a refund from a cancelled flight. 16 months ago! No reply to any of my emails and impossible to talk to anyone on customer service number.

### "told me I’d receive no voucher"
I’ve been extremely patient with the refund of 10 flights in 2020, two of which are still pending. Vueling staff confirming on my outbound flight that I’d receive a hotel voucher for the return flight, which was rerouted through Barcelona. It was impossible to get in touch before through phone, web, chat or email to get this confirmed. In Barcelona, no Vueling crew was to be found at 9PM and the Iberia staff at the Vueling counter told me I’d receive no voucher. Not offering any help whatsoever, hiding behind their Iberia logos and the info they got from Vueling. I don’t want to discover if the lack of customer service has further lows, so by now I’m convinced that paying the 30e extra for KLM will be more than worth it. Many thanks to the Vueling crews, your service has been brilliant (if you fly).

### "Airline to be avoided"
Airline to be avoided, if there is a problem they do not provide a solution. The plane could not land in Bilbao due to weather conditions, for some passengers it was the second time this happened to them within 24 hours. Vueling knew about the weather conditions but they decided to fly anyway, to try their best. When the plane could not land we returned to Barcelona. They left people waiting during more than an hour in a queue for a solution. Some passengers that have meetings in Bilbao were advised to just cancel their tickets through the app and book a new one. Their solution 0. After more than an hour queueing they provided boarding passes for flight after 9 or 14 hours if you were lucky, this was depending on when you book the flight.

### "communication channels have changed"
As described in my review yesterday, Vueling Customer Service Dept informed me (on both outward and return flights) that they "could not validate my documents", without indicating what the problem was, thus preventing me from checking in online. I drafted a complaint, providing full details of the totally inadequate service provided by Customer Service, and sent it to them yesterday. I have just received their response, a pro forma apology, shorter than the one they sent me after my outward flight. Not a word about the specific points outlined in my complaint, and no explanation of why the could not validate my documents. My request for an explanation was the key point of my complaint, because I want to know what happened so that I can avoid any repetition. I sent an immediate reply to their apology, and by automatic reply I received this message: "Dear customer, We inform you that this email address has been deactivated. We are pleased to inform you that our Customer Service communication channels have changed in order to be able to offer you a better service. An excellent case of Vueling's actions speaking louder than their words.

### "lack of respect for the customer"
CSD phone n° in Paris only has recorded message in 3 languages; no option to speak to an agent (unbelievable!) 2) only way to contact CSD is by email but, when initial issue I raised was not solved and I emailed CSD again (3 times), CSD never replied. When CSD had an issue with documents they need to validate so that I could check-in online, and indicated something "may be missing", CSD did not state what was missing, even when I asked - then I received email saying Vueling "could not validate [my] documents" and I was not able to check-in online. On my outward flight, after I reached my destination, I received an email from CSD offering their "most sincere apologies" for inadequate service. For my return flight, my experience of the outward flight with CSD was repeated almost identically: CSD had an issue with the documents I had uploaded, and sent me an email saying I needed a PCR test to return to France, which for persons fully vaccinated (my case) does not figure among the requirements of the French authorities (nor in the list of requirements for France on the Vueling site) - I emailed CSD again (3 times), never receiving any reply - then I received an email saying Vueling "could not validate my documents" and I was not able to check-in online. When I checked-in in person, the Vueling agent handed me my boarding-pass on both occasions, in 30 seconds - and everything was hassle-free on the flights themselves. As a result of this experience, I decided to complain to Vueling and, to that end, I prepared a 4-page summary of my CSD experience - in order to avoid any repetition, I wanted to try at least to discover why CSD had not validated my documents in both directions. However, like the above, the CSD complaints procedure permitted areas of complaint are limited to  "language" (that used to communicate with CSD), and "waiting time" (how long before CSD replies to the queries from customers). In the free text box ("your query"), one can outline one's complaint but not at any great length. There is no possibility to send a document or any type of file as an attachment to the complaint. CSD does not acknowledge receipt of the complaint, not even with an automated standard message, which means that I have no record of having made my complaint, and no copy of its content. I am left with the impression that Vueling, once the customer has paid for the flight, feels it is free to do whatever it wants (change the flight, impose a credit rather than refund in case of cancellation), and not do what it should do (answer emails, explain document validation decisions, provide an adequate complaint system, enable customers to speak to a Vueling agent), a total lack of respect for the customer.

### "had an EU recovery covid certificate"
Had a direct flight from Ibiza to Paris on the 25 September 2021. I had an EU recovery covid certificate - green pass which was not accepted on the registration desk. The agent refused to check me in, she behaved rudely and told me that I can't take a flight. She didn't have a scan but she decided that I needed to make a test. The manager told me the same, they demanded me to take a test at the airport. They told me I need to have a negative test to be considered as recovered. They refused to listen my explanations that I don't need a test as I have a recovery certificate. I told them that I already sent all the documents on the Vueling website ( it is obligatory to send the green pass a day before a trip to be able to get on board), my documents were cheked and I got the mail that I can check in, they didn't check this information. They told me to go away and that I can't fly without a test. I left, 15 min later they discovered that they were wrong and checked me in. The registration agent never apologised when I asked her about it. Instead of that they were rude and harassed me.

### "asking for my doctor’s note"
I contracted COVID 19 and was not able to fly. I sent them the doctor’s medical certificate yet they keep me asking for the same document over and over again. Even with a valid reason like this, they refuse to issue a voucher, non a refund, instead they keep sending the same email asking for my doctor’s note. I rather pay more money but if I can avoid it.

### "deliberately selling direct flights they don't have"
Not Verified |  This airline are deliberately selling direct flights they don't have giving the impression at point of purchase that your flight will take just over an hour. They then change your flight schedule just before the compensation date of 2 weeks before the flight for a non direct flight that goes via Barcelona. Paris to London via Barcelona only makes sense to a Spanish airline company that doesn't actually have the right to fly direct, yet publishes its flights as direct and gets around this with the loophole that even on purchase of what they call a Cancellation Policy, you are not entitled to a refund! The booking confirmation email does not allow you to check the policy of your cancellation insurance, if you click on the link it just takes you to an error page.Avoid at all costs, unless you are flying to Spain!

### "crew were friendly, efficient and totally professional"
My first flight with Vueling - which I'd dreaded after reading reviews on here! It was excellent - apart from a few glitches uploading all the covid necessary documents for verification pre check-in. All Vueling staff - from airport bag drop to gate team to crew great. On board the cleanest aircraft I've ever flown, the crew were friendly, efficient and totally professional. Service was quick and the flight a delight.

### "they will not give us a refund"
They changed our direct flight from Copenhagen to Malaga in December 2021 to a stopover one, so we naturally wanted to cancel the flight. We canceled the flight, but they will not give us a refund. Only flight credit. Their customer service are a total joke, with no interest to help customers.

### "need to have a better customer service"
Terrible service. I try to cancel my trip and get any credit for that and travel after this COVID situation. I called many times and nobody answer phone. I sent e mail but no luck. They have requested place but it’s to hard to find it. They made everything confused for costumers. I know that this a low cost company but they need to have a better customer service.

### "Horrible check-in experience"
Horrible check-in experience - the reservation code provided for the airline did not function on the Vueling airline website - trying to call customer service was useless: no combination of answer on the machine could get to an agent, just basic useless information. Trying to use the internet chatbot was even worse. Finally, even the link sent to the phone did not work. To be avoided!

### "I couldn't cancel my flight"
If you book a flight with this airline you will not be able to cancel it in case of death of a family member. One of my family members had passed away, and as I tried to cancel my flight (get a refund or a voucher), could not reach anyone at the customer service. I checked their web page - I couldn't cancel my flight there. I tried calling all of their phone numbers. Some were busy, the others just referred me to their web page. There is just no way one can cancel a flight booked with this airline. Stay away from this company!

### "The worst airline I've ever flown with"
The worst airline I've ever flown with, switched my flight to Florence 4 times, and then switched my flight back to Paris to a day earlier without telling me! A company run by a bunch of incompetent idiots, good luck getting any money back. They left me with my only option of going to Barcelona for a 5 hour layover! Never fly Vueling!

### "wasn't allowed to bring on board my small guitar"
I wasn't allowed to bring on board my small guitar, I had to pay 60 dollars to check it in as special luggage! The flight was half empty and I could always keep it under my seat.

### "uncaring, money grubbing airline"
Not Verified |  We booked tickets for a flight within Europe with Vueling Airlines. Vueling cancelled the flight due to covid. We asked for a refund of our money. They refused a refund and gave us a flight credit that expires in January 2022. We will not be travelling for another 12 months or longer depending on Covid so the flight credit will expire. What is really disgraceful is that we were charged an exorbitant fee for baggage for a flight we will never make. We tried getting a refund of our money once again a few weeks ago, but with no success. The airline said we voluntarily accepted the flight credit. What a bunch of lies. We had no other option from the airline. We asked for a refund but they refused. We had airline tickets with another airline from Canada to Europe and they returned our money for tickets purchased when they cancelled the flight due to Covid. Vueling is an uncaring, money grubbing airline which I will never use in the future. Their customer relations are horrible.

### "only suitable for local flights"
Not Verified |  Very cheap airline, only suitable for local flights within Spain and with your backpack. If any connecting flights after that, you can forget about your luggage. Too complicated for them.

### "wouldn't refund my flight"
Not Verified |  Vueling cancelled my flight and offered another flight two days after or a refund. I chose the refund. Later on they said that due to Covid-19 there wouldn't refund my flight and closed my complaint file. On their website they advertise for full refund in case of cancellation. Never flying with them again.

### "I won't be shedding a tear when they go out of business"
You're better off setting your money on fire - at least you will avoid disappointment and dealing with apathetic people who shouldn't be in business. We had flight boarding denied on departure on a weekend flight. As a result, we were unable to leave the country. Returned home to try and reschedule the return leg of the journey. Vueling's website just wouldn't work. Called, no answer. Emailed, no answer. Finally spoke to someone and managed to raise a claim. Vueling responds saying it was too late! Despite their website being the cause of the inability to cancel the flight! I won't be shedding a tear when they go out of business.

### "they gave me a voucher that expired"
They automated all their replies to just say that they apologize and they cannot refund or help you in anyway. And that it's not their fault because of Covid. Well it's not our fault either, I paid 200euros for my flights in March 2020 and I didn't even ask for a refund, I asked to use that money for flights in the future and they gave me a voucher that expired. I paid for services that I am not getting.

### "Avoid this airline!"
My flight from Budapest to Barcelona in May 2020 was cancelled because of Covid. I received an email informing me that the price would be transferred to a flight credit and then later informed that there would be no refund credit processed at all. This is wrong. Repeated phone calls and emails and gone unanswered. My account on their website has been removed. There seems to be no way to combat this abuse and fraud other than warn potential future travellers by review sites such as this. Avoid this airline!

### "refuses to offer a refund of any kind"
Rating for Vueling should really be 0/10. Vueling is the most awful and unprofessional airline I've ever had to deal with. Borders were closed with the COVID-19 pandemic and Vueling refuses to offer a refund of any kind. They only offered a travel credit to which I'm still unable to use. I've emailed multiple times and have never received a response. I've also called several times and had to deal with a very rude and unprofessional customer service agent who hung up on me twice. I've also sent a direct message on Twitter which resulted in no assistance. It seems that this airline has taken advantage of many customers and refuses to offer any kind of refund even though many of their flights were cancelled due to the pandemic. I will never fly with Vueling and refuse to give this airline any business in the future.

### "Highly not recommended"
Due to Covid Pandemic, they cancelled the ticket. Vueling doesn't even respond to me. It's been one year. Still, nobody answered I sent dozens of mail. Long story short, they are just turning this crisis into an opportunity by aggrieving their own customers. They don't even have the dignity to answer emails. Highly not recommended.

### "eliminated the option for a refund"
On 20 April 2020 I booked a flight with Vueling Airlines for 3rd June from Seville to Stockholm. It was the only airline which publicly advertised on its webpage that if the flight gets cancelled due to the new pandemic restrictions A FULL REFUND will be provided. I have also called the company and got a confirmation about it. Now almost 1 year later they did not provide me with any service and decline to give a refund saying they don't have to give a refund and ignoring my case! On 11th May 2020 the flight got cancelled and the date moved to 2 weeks later. This continued to happen up until the 7th July. The company provided no solutions and caused me major extra expenses! When cancelling my booking due to the flights they kept cancelling I was only offered the option for a voucher or nothing else. They eliminated the option for a refund!

### "they won’t refund our money"
They cancelled our 2020 reservation due to Covid. Totally understandable. When I went to rebook for 2021, they don’t offer the same flight combo on the day we need to travel and they won’t refund our money either (€835). Pretty terrible. They are also very hard to reach.

### "airline refuses to give me a refund"
I purchased a ticket for a friend of mine. In April, due to the covid-19 situation, the flight was canceled. I understand not being entitled to compensation for the inconvenience because it was force majeure. However, I paid for a service. The service was not fulfilled and the airline refuses to give me a refund. They just keep the money.

### "Friendly crew and on time performance"
Not Verified |  Good flight, boarding process went smooth and with all the needed covid-19 measures, at the entrance of the plane the staff gave us a hygienic handkerchief. Friendly crew and on time performance.

### "they have still not refunded me"
Vueling have caused me a lot of stress. They cancelled our flights to Rome, in April, as the Covid pandemic worsened in Italy. After numerous phone calls, working my way through the menus and sometimes being cut off after waiting for long periods of time, they have still not refunded me for flights they cancelled. I tried applying for the refund on line, as they stipulated on several e mails - but at the end of the process, a sentence comes up saying we are not entitled to a refund. I have been trying for 3 months now. I also e mailed the CEO about it- and heard nothing back. I will never book with them again. Very disappointing.

### "they are thoroughly inflexible"
Not Verified | We booked a Paris to Venice flight for the 1st october, 2 days before the Italian government put in new measures related to the COVID 19 pandemic, namely that of needing a negative covid test done within 72 hours of travelling (feat which proved impossible for us at the moment in France due to a saturation of our labs with tests and delays of one week to receive the test results). We attempted to discuss with the airline's customer service the possibility of changing our flight, as reimbursement was non negotiable; we would have been very happy to consider a change of destination, especially given we understand this time is difficult for airlines, but it was impossible to have any conversation whatsoever. I explained other airlines were offering flight changes, in terms of dates and destination, but Vueling would not consider this at all despite the pandemic and the difficulties it represents for everyone, whether customer or business. We do not recommend you consider travelling with this company at any time while the pandemic continues considering how quickly governmental measures can change as they are thoroughly inflexible on this matter and will not attempt to help you. It is not worth even considering to continue travelling when the risk is of losing all your money. We were incredibly disappointed that there was absolutely no opportunity for discussion when many businesses have shown great flexibility and adaptation during this pandemic. I cannot speak to the quality of the actual flight as we will not be taking it.

### "just want to have my money back"
I will never book via Vueling again. My flight was cancelled due to the insolvency of LEVEL. After waiting for some weeks I received an e-mail with information to "manage my booking" in order to get a voucher to be used for another flight. I was not able to "manage my booking", a heading was shown on the site to contact the customer service to get more information. Ever since I have contacted the customer support number 020 808 1295 already 5 times in order to receive a voucher. They explained me that the booking number on my ticket was my voucher number. I tried to use it and it was expired "invalid". I called again to ask why this is and they assured to send me a new voucher number since the one I tried was clearly not used. I have waited for days although they assured that they would send it right away to my email address. I called again and the assured me again that they would send me the new voucher.. never happened. I called again and the lady on the line would not believe me that I am the person related to the booking although I provided her with all the details. She hang up. I called one last time and they forwarded me to call LEVEL to get a refund although Vueling offered a flight voucher in the first place since the flight was operated through them. There is no chance that I reach Level as they are insolvent. At this stage I just want to have my money back.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience during the crisis. No compensation and customer service is a robot answering mails. Company in decline. Will never recommend to anyone.

### "over reacted bad treatment"
Terrible covid experience in Lanzarote-Malaga flight. Because of previous health issues I am unable to wear a mask (breathing problems) but wore one because of Vueling`s norms and regulations. My seat neighbor started complaining about me wearing my mask with my nose free and ended up screaming at me. The staff came and after I had explained my situation insisted of having me wear the mask the whole flight which gave my an extremely uncomfortable 2 hours with headache and breathing problems. The row in front of me and my 2 seat neighbors were offered other seats while I was treated like a pariah with everyone staring at me with disapproval. What kind of treatment is that? A flight attendant even asked for my health history which I had to show her and which is illegal according to EU law. I don't think that situation can be explained with a supposed Covid emergency. It was rude, not justified and over reacted bad treatment of a paying customer.

### "they were bound to pay compensation"
Three hours after trying to check-in and two hours before scheduled departure, flight was cancelled on day of departure. Airline informed passengers they were re-booked the following morning, transport to hotel was provided with snack meals for dinner and breakfast. No attempts to inform passengers on arrival, at check-in or any other time until the cancellation was announced - this delay prevented passengers accessing alternative airlines and making connecting flights where applicable. From the outset, they used EC 261/2004 regulations and asserted they were not liable due to "extraordinary circumstances". I acknowledged they had provided transport, meals and accommodation (as provided for in the same regulations) but that they were bound to pay compensation for cancellation of the flight. This was refused by the airline and I referred the matter to the designated authority responsible for compliance with these regulations. Almost a year after the cancellation and extensive, very frustrating correspondence, the authority agreed that the airline was liable - copies of this report were sent to the airline, who maintain that they are not liable. As the authority states that their findings are not binding on the airline, we now have a set of regulations passed to protect the interests of passengers, a statutory body to ensure compliance, an enquiry and finding, all of which are seemingly unenforceable against the defaultin

### "won't be using this airline again"
I received an email from Vueling notifying me I can receive a refund in the form of airline credit as the flight was canceled due to COVID (email attached). I am in the US and they make it terribly hard to contact them via phone and website contact form to claim the credit. Finally I was able to submit a claim 24 hours before the date of the flight. After all of that I received a reply saying they couldn’t give me a credit for some BS reason. I won't be using this airline again.

### "very disappointed and frustrated"
I live in Brazil and I am Brazilian. In January 2020 I bought four international tickets from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Madrid, Spain to fly in July 2020. And my plans were to travel within Spain to the balearic islands. So, in February 1st 2020, I bought four tickets with Vueling Airlines to fly from Menorca (MAH) to Barcelona (BCN) on July 22nd 2020. In February the situation of the Covi19 pandemia was not significant yet and nobody knew for sure what would happen then. Unfortunately the situation escalated worldwide in the next few months, with Spain being severely affected and then Brazil, where I live, also being severely affected. Long story short, my flight out of Brazil to Spain was cancelled and I, as a Brazilian citizen, am not allowed to enter Europe, according to the European Union decision, until (at least) August 1st 2020. I have proof of the cancellation of my international flight. But Vueling Airlines has not cancelled my internal flight from Menorca to Barcelona, as the Covid19 situation in Spain seems to be better and the country is back open to a few nationalities (Brazil is not included though!). So, I contacted Vueling Airlines to try to get a voucher with the credit for this internal flight I have bought, as I will not be able to fly because I am not allowed to enter Europe. Please note that Vueling is being flexible with a lot of its customers and offering vouchers with credit and the possibility to reschedule their flights for free. But the response from Vueling for my case is that they will not issue me a voucher with the credit for this flight and the only possibility I have to reschedule my flight is to PAY a fee. I think this is absurd! I am not allowed to get into Spain! And I don't know when I will be! Besides that, I was travelling with my husband and 2 sons, who will be back in school as of August, so I don't know when we will be able to take this trip again. It does not make sense to pay to reschedule everytime! Vueling does not care for customer satisfaction at all! They are being very unreasonable with my case! I am not in Spain because I am not allowed to be there! I would have never bought this ticket with Vueling if I knew i would not be able to enter Spain to fly! I am not crazy to throw money away! I am very disappointed and frustrated with Vueling! Terrible airline!

### "they should provide rescheduling"
Airline cancelled the flight. I contacted customer service numerous times, and so did the travel agency to no avail for compensation. Agency tries to contact Vueling. They do not answer directly to them. I contact them directly asking for a solution. Vueling invokes EC Regulation 261/200, Article 5.3, to refuse providing a solution. I agree with them invoking EC Regulation 261/200. I remark that article 8(c) says they should provide rescheduling at a convenient time for me (Article 5.2 says they should also provide alternatives which they didn't). 5) They respond that the agency should contact them and not me. Agency tries again, unable to get a response. I ask for a specific way the agency should get in touch with them. They reply with "we cannot attend your petition". They ask for the agency to get in touch with them (return to 6, and repeat). I was even supportive of the fact they were abiding to EC regulations; that was great! But after they realized it also bound them to provide a solution, they backtracked their steps.

### "Worst airline ever"
We bought the ticket from Vueling and the carrier was Level Europe. Vueling sent an email saying that Level Europe went bankrupt so they will return voucher to us and that was it. No money returned, no voucher and they are still selling the same flight tickets ın their website. Worst airline ever.

### "Vueling couldn’t care less"
Zero customer service. My husband flew a code share on 31 May from Sydney to Doha then Barcelona with Qatar then connecting to a Vueling flight on the 1st June to Alicante. My husbands luggage never made it onto the Vueling flight. On arrival at Alicante, he and another pax went to the lost luggage office where a Vueling claim form was completed. On Wednesday 3rd, we had a call to say it was found .. still in Barcelona and would be forwarded to Alicante. We are still waiting. Not only that but Vueling are denying any responsibility saying my husband is at fault for filling out the wrong form and so refuse to assist! Qatar have confirmed the luggage was at Barcelona and that Vueling had it marked to be forwarded to Alicante. There is nothing more Qatar can do which I understand. However, Vueling have such a bad attitude it’s become very stressful. Vueling couldn’t care less.

### "refund application was to be processed"
Vueling Airlines notified us by emails in March 2020 that our return flights to Mallorca in the first week of April 2020 had been cancelled as a consequence of the Covid-19 outbreak. We logged on to our online account and requested that their full cost be refunded back to the credit card from which they had been deducted. As the only confirmation of this refund request that we possessed was a screenshot, it was decided to telephone Customer Services to ensure that this decision had been accurately recorded. In the course of a conversation with Vueling representative Isa on 29 March she confirmed that our refund application was to be processed but that, because of staff shortages, it might take up to eight weeks. As stipulated eight weeks had passed, felt that our patience had run out, particularly bearing in mind that the airline had a legal obligation to refund us within seven days in accordance with articles 5(1)(a) and 8(1)(a) of EC Regulation No.261/2004, so decided to chase it. Numerous attempts to contact the company by telephone came to naught as, after holding for a while, the automated system cut us off. Further emails sent this week to Customer Services and the company CEO have been met with a standard acknowledgement which asks that we telephone their offices if we wish to request a refund. As previously, attempts to contact this company fail with calls being cut off. Whilst appreciating the problems currently besetting the airline industry the facts in this matter are that monies held by Vueling since we booked in January were legally repayable long ago since this is a clear breach of contract with no flights having been provided.

### "They charged me twice"
Be very careful booking online. They charged me twice for both transactions but I didn’t notice until a month or two later (I didn’t get two emails). I contacted my credit card company but they couldn’t help because Vueling kept saying I bought two tickets. I contacted Vueling numerous times - I kept having to try because I couldn’t always get someone who spoke English. They refused to help saying I had to contact my card company. Round and round I went.

### "Horrendous customer service"
Not Verified |  Vueling Airlines makes it next to impossible to speak to a human by calling their "customer service" help line. They are denying me a refund for a flight that I requested months in advance due to COVID-19. My flight from the United States to Europe was canceled with no alternative flight due to COVID-19, therefore, I will be unable to be on this flight. However, since the flight with Vueling Airlines in Europe has not been canceled yet, they will not issue a refund. I knowingly will not be able to attend my flight in August, and they will not get past their initial pre-set customer service line of "we will have to see the conditions at a later time". Please use your brain and think about each situation differently than reading a teleprompter. Horrendous customer service!

### "offered a rebook or refund option"
I had a flight booked for the 28th March 2020 from Heathrow to Barcelona, due to covid 19 this flight was cancelled. To this day I have never received my cancellation email, so I have never been offered a rebook or refund option from them. I contacted customer services 26th March and they advised me to wait for my cancellation email, I heard nothing back and requested a charge back from my bank. This got rejected as Vueling stated that the flight had been cancelled and I had been offered a rebook or refund option, they sent the documentation to my bank, which had been forwarded onto myself, Since the 1st may vueling are now stating the flight operated, it never cancelled. I will never use this airline again.

### "Non-existent customer service"
Not Verified |  Non-existent customer service. Covid 19 cancellation with terrible communication. No offer of a refund. Trying to get through to someone was extremely difficult on the phone service. I had to press the buttons as if I wanted to join their flight club to actually get through to a human. This was no help as they refused to issue a refund. I hope the company goes bankrupt they deserve it for the way they’ve treated their passengers. I also had flights with Easyjet and TUI who gave great customer service and email updates and also refunds. I will never book a flight with Vueling again.

### "I asked for a refund"
Due to the Spanish restrictions because of the Covid-19 I couldn’t take my flight. I asked for a refund and they denied it. I asked again for at least the refund of the luggage reservation (assuming the loss of the flight) but nothing.

### "never fly with Vueling again"
Not Verified |  My wife and I had seats booked on a Vueling plane from Ibiza to Valencia in October 2019 to connect with another flight (same airline) to Lisbon. At the last minute they cancelled the flight with no reason and told us to book the next day (which didn't link with our connection). We changed our booking to Ryanair and requested a refund on line as Vueling requested. To date (April 2020) we have not received a refund and no one will return our calls. This bad experience cost us an additional $100. Will never fly with Vueling again.

### "I want my refund"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. The flight was cancelled, great, totally understandable in these times. Get an email telling me to click here for a refund. Then get an email saying you've been given a flight voucher, which I can not find. Trying to get hold of customer service is a whole different story. You call one number, that tells you to call another. You then go through multiple options (which takes over 3 mins) for them to say "no one is available, call back later" and hangs the phone up! Apparently I have until December to use my non-existent flight voucher, but I will not accept this. I want my refund and I will never use this company again.

### "no refund, no voucher"
Alicante to Milan. Flight was cancelled due to COVID-19, Vueling  email to say voucher will be issued, if I wanted refund to call them. Told to go to manage my booking and fill out form. I had an e-mail this morning to say no refund, no voucher .. nothing. They have closed my case, I cannot get through on phone. They are acting against EU laws and it seems there is nothing I or anyone else can do about it.

### "not receive a refund"
Barcelona to Dublin. Vueling cancelled my flight due to COVID19. I eventually contacted an agent who said I would receive a full refund in 8 weeks. 4 hours later, I receive an e-mail saying that my refund claim has been rejected and I will not receive a refund.

### "Vueling trying to cheat me out of a refund"
My flight was cancelled due to COVID-19, for which I have complete understanding. I was offered the possibility to fly at a later date (although no-one knows when flights will be resumed) or cancel and receive a refund. I opted for the cancellation and received, ten days later, a voucher which expires on 31 December 2020. Vueling is clearly hoping that passengers do not know their rights under European law and will accept their currently worthless IOUs. I've informed them that I am not falling for their mean little trick and copied them the relevant text from the Spanish regulator AESA. In brief, the passenger has a right to a cash refund within 7 days, unless he/she explicitly agrees to accept a credit instead. I understand completely why my flight was cancelled, but I have no understanding whatsoever for Vueling trying to cheat me out of a refund.

### "I would receive a voucher"
My flight from London to A Coruña on 19 March was cancelled. I received an email offering either the possibility to book other flights or a refund. I chose a refund. I then received an email saying that I would receive a voucher. I wrote to say that I did not want a voucher and reiterated my request for a refund which is my choice under Regulation 261/04. I then received an email saying my payment had been turned into a flight credit. If I wanted a refund, I would have to call them. Predictably they are refusing to answer the phone.

### "will never utilize this airline"
Florence to Lisbon via Barcelona. I didn’t actually fly with them. I booked a ticket - albeit in the time of COVID pandemic which of course they were aware of - and less than 24 hrs after I booked they sent an email saying they canceled the flight. The email I received that said they canceled also said I would get the ability to rebook or get a refund within 7 days. I reached out to them as I got neither and they said COVID was out of their control and they would not give me any type of reimbursement. I didn’t cancel - they did. And they did it in less than 24 hrs - I will never utilize this airline and will advise all people I know to never use them.

### "not get exchange or cancelled"
I had a Barcelona to Rome ticket for the end of April 2020, and with the Coronavirus I decided to change my itinerary and skip Italy. I called to exchange my flight and was told that the flight will not get exchange or cancelled. I wish I can give 0 stars of how horrible the experience has been. I lost my money.

### "overall a very good experience"
Not Verified |  Following all the bad reviews I was apprehensive in travelling with Vueling Airlines. But I was agreeably surprised and very happy that everything went so smoothly. They both left on time and I had no problems with transferring apart from the very long distance between the two Gates. I travelled from Malaga to Barcelona, and transferred to a Dublin Flight there. The Staff were lovely on Board and very helpful. I enjoyed Malage-BCN very much. Barcelona to Dublin a little less comfortable.- I felt plane was not clean, a bit stuffy and very noisy esp on landing in a Storm in Dub. Overall a very good experience. Good Value for money, punctual and professional.

### "baggage fee was also non-refundable"
Not Verified |  Palma de Mallorca to Seville. Cheap airfare. Took assurance it was a good risk when I saw the same flight was also book under an Iberia flight number. They hit you with surprise fees and charge for water. On the advice of a friend I paid for my only checked bag in advance. It cost as much as the airfare! When I next booked a flight with them, I paid the baggage fee in advance. After, I decided on a different flight pattern (see above flight experience). I knew my flight cost was non refundable (being so cheap) but was surprised to learn from their call center that my prepaid baggage fee was also non-refundable.

### "embarrassing and degrading experience"
Not Verified |  Birmingham to Barcelona. I was subjected to a most embarrassing and degrading experience. Having booked and paid for an extra space seat (2c), when I arrived at the check-in the desk clerk offered me a seat on an emergency exit isle as it had ‘more room’. All with the best of intentions I am sure. When seated, I asked a crew member for a seat belt extender, and she barked at me that I could not have one sitting there and ordered me to move to another seat. The seat I was forced to move to was not an extra legroom seat and proved completely in appropriate for someone my size. I protested that I had paid an upgrade fee, but was told to go to the desk in Barcelona. When the attendant handed me the seatbelt extenders she could not have made it more overt, so all the surrounding passengers could see, it was as though she was handing a lasso an elephant. This experience was humiliating, demeaning and discriminatory in the extreme, and the fear of being removed from the plane prevented me from protesting further. If I could have found another flight to Barcelona I would have walked off the plane. This company is not interested at all in the fact that I did not get what I paid for, and their customers are discriminated against and humiliated without any redress. I also ordered a hot chicken meal - big mistake, it was not reheated well at all! Avoid, especially if you are of large build.

### "plane diverted to Barcelona"
Not Verified |  Booked to go from  Gatwick to Alicante, plane diverted to Barcelona before take off. Handling agent had no idea or information on onward about travel, hotel, and accommodation. No compensation if I did not get on plane, plane under booked with approx 25 passengers, by text plane was late and delayed due to technical reasons, then operational reasons, Captain made no comment when asked. My only good advice I can give if Vueling cannot do the basics right then find another airline, 8 hours by coach or delayed onward flight happened the week before and so you can kiss good by to two days of your holiday.

### "service at Stockholm the worst"
Stockholm to Barcelona. The cabin was 30 degrees to force people to buy drinks. The staff are slow, it takes 2,5 hrs on a 3 hrs flight to get to row 30. Their service at Stockholm Arlanda provided by Menzies are the worst.

### "ground and flight crew fantastic"
Madrid to Florence. Both ground crew and flight crew fantastic. Really appreciated USB outlet. I met Lola at checkin and again at boarding in Madrid. Her courtesy and professionalism are outstanding. Seems to really like her job and care for passengers. I have flown a great deal but rarely meet someone as genuine in her hospitality as Lola. Hope someone reads this from the company and acknowledges her in some way. The pilot did not give canned speeches, but was also sincere in his welcome and goodbyes. I intruded upon the flight attendants to ask about an inexpensive product for sale in in-flight magazine and they went out of their way to be helpful. Couldn’t ask for better all around service.

### "refused to pay compensation"
Granada to Barcelona. Delayed for over 10 hours and Vueling refused to pay the compensation of 250Euro. Only after reporting them to AESA they finally paid one of us the outstanding money. However the second payout has not arrived and even though we have a payment reference number we are unable to contact them in regards to this outstanding payout. Phone calls get simply hung up on and there is no way you can send emails to this super dodgy airline.

### "Unprofessional and inefficient"
l flew from Paris Orly airport to Milan MXP on 31st December 2019. My friends Received their luggage but my baggage never came on the luggage belt. After waiting for 45 minutes, I went to the airport lost and found as there is no Vueling counter at Milan Airport. The airport authorities confirmed that Vueling had left couple of bags back at Paris Orly airport. My heart sank in, I was in Milan for new years and my luggage carelessly left behind in Paris by Vueling. I filed the report took the copy and left for Air BnB. For next one and half day there was no confirmation from Vueling about status of my luggage. After two days, on 2nd January 2020 night I received a confirmation from Milan Airport authorities that my baggage has finally arrived but Vueling airlines were unresponsive to the miserable situation they had put me in. I was denied delivery of my luggage on 2 ND January night and 3rd January morning as the courier delivery services weren't working. On 3rd January 2020, I woke up at 6.30 am to reach Milan Airport from my Air BnB which was 1hour 30 minutes away from my Air BnB via Metro and Train to retrieve my luggage and back, on which I had to spend another 56 Euros. I raised claim of all these expenses to Vueling, attaching Invoices, receipts for clothes, travel via metro and train etc. Vueling is offering an amount of 187 USD while my expenses alone costed 256Euros. What a shame on Vueling, I have emailed them 50 times with proof of invoices, receipts and all necessary documents but all I receive from them is an automated response, we will get back to you, your request is under process. It's been 15 days to the chase but they still haven't come up with an accurate response as to how they are refusing to cover my expenses which I was forced to make in a foreign land for survival as they misplaced my luggage for 2.5 days. I have sent them a legal notice through lawyer, which was two days and shamelessly they replied via an automated reply. Vueling is the most Unprofessional and inefficient airlines ever.

### "arrogant customer support"
Barcelona to Paris. Suffice to say Vueling Airline is the worst and I have flown Lion Air so that's saying something. Overbooked a late flight and didn't let us on board. Instead of attempting to find a solution they chose the "It's legal in Spain" and "you bought the ticket not a seat" rhetoric and refused to have any conversation with their customers. Also hid the gate number to avoid people from getting to the late and overbooked flight. Greedy company, arrogant customer support. Do the world a favor and give your hard-earned money to some other company.

### "luggage with a broken handle"
Paris to Malaga via Barcelona. First of all they lost my luggage, then after 48 hours they brought my luggage with a broken handle. After 10 days of back and forth e-mails, I was told broken handles and broken wheels are not called damaged and they are not responsible. Now I have a broken suitcase and have to travel back home.

### "delayed and then cancelled"
Not Verified |  Was scheduled to fly from Vienna to Florence on 1/4/20 at 5:45 pm. The flight was delayed several times and then cancelled. I was rescheduled on another flight to Pisa for next day at 11:45 am. It’s now 5 pm and still at the airport waiting, no communication from the airline or the airport. Called the airline several time as well as the airport customer service and nobody can give any information.

### "not allow us to fly that day"
We were 5 passengers traveling from Barcelona to Madrid. The night before our flight I noticed that the airline had changed our return flight for an hour after we arrived in Madrid. I tried calling to no avail the message was that they were closed for the night to try customer service in the morning after 9:00am. Which was after our scheduled flight left. We decided to go and try and fix the problem at the airport. We checked in, checked in our luggage ask the agent what we could do to fix the return flight, he said we had to go to the customer service counter because he could not help us. We get there and there are a young guy and a girl talking and laughing. When we tell him what has happened he says the airline has the right to change the flight when they want. We said yes, but this is not even humanly possible to get back a flight after arriving 1 hour earlier. We had booked a room and paid for it in Madrid at least a month before. The guy then said that their systems were down and he couldn't help us. We told him that we had tried online and couldn't fix it and that the check in agent had told us that they were the ones who had to make the changes. He then got really rude and said, it looks like you don't understand what I am saying. When I tried to get his name he told me that he didn't have to give me anything, he got angry and told us he would not allow us to fly that day, he picked up the phone and told someone to not let us board. We tried to get our luggage that we had paid additional for back and they could not get our luggage back. This was 5 or six days ago and we still don't know where our luggage is. We begged for our luggage as the plane had not left they could not get it back. To this day, although we called several times they still have not found or sent us the luggage. They just tell us to go online, but when we do, they tell us that the luggage has not been found. We didn't get to fly. So we lost our money for the 5 tickets.

### "I missed my other flight"
Paris to Lisbon. The first fly was on 2019/12/20 with a departure time at 7:45 and an arrival time at 9:15, at the end the flight was delayed for about 5 hours. The real departure time was about 12:00 and with an arrival time of about 14:30. Moreover, many passengers cannot have a space for their hand-baggage on the airplane. Finally, I cannot catch my connection fly to Toronto. The fly was actually operated by Vueling airline, but my ticket was sold by Iberia. Then I tried to have contact with the Iberia representative at the Lisbon airport. What I got is just one piece of paper with a phone number in Portugal. As mentioned on the website, they should provide English assistance, however the real case is that they only speak Portuguese or Spanish to me. Fortunately a nice local family helped me to communicate with Iberia company. After a very long time communication with them, they have no response for my situation. They said that it is not their business to pay me anything because I missed my other flight.

### "they couldn’t find my reservation"
c✅ Trip Verified |  London to Tangier via Barcelona. I paid for my ticket on the 13th December 2019 my flight was December 16th 2019. I came from Canada and I’m on vacation to visit my dad in Morocco . When I checked in 24 hrs before the flight they couldn’t find my reservation because they said it was canceled even though they charged my Visa (called to verify) - basically the only advice was to go to the airport and talk to ticket office there. The trip to the airport took me 2 hrs and when I got there they said the flight was sold out and they can’t do nothing for me. So now I’m stuck in London for 2 days. And when I called the airline again they hang up on me. I don’t know how any company can treat paying costumers like this.

### "provided terrible service"
Barcelona to Tel Aviv. Vueling absolutely sucks. This is the second time I fly with them and again they provided terrible service. The plane took off 1 hour late, the AC wasn't working properly, the paid wifi did not work, and they did not pack the luggage for half of the passengers of the flight.

### "Absolutely horrific"
Milan to Malaga via Barcelona. Absolutely horrific. Never fly this airline! Especially if you have baggage. After we arrived in Malaga, there were about 15 people with lost bags. There was one lady, extremely slow dealing with the lost bags. She took 15 min just to deal with one guy, waiting for him to call his friends who could speak English etc. They then keep on telling you lies and wasting your time. I took this flight because it was the only option. If there is no other airline that day, instead of taking Vueling just cancel your plans and go the next day with another airline.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Barcelona. Shocking, flight should have taken off 09.40, left at 18.20, £5 to feed for nearly 8 hours, also lost a day in Barcelona. When I complained and asked to be compensated, their response was that "due to reasons beyond our control" they do not have to compensate. Didn't think it was unreasonable to ask what those circumstances are and they now ignore my emails. Complete shower, would never fly with them again.

### "service is still very good"
Florence to Gatwick. Had a bad experience at the airport I was leaving from but this airline definitely made my night good again! The staff was very friendly and all instructions were displayed very clearly around the airplane. From the moment I entered the aircraft till the moment I left I had a really good experience! The staff is very welcoming and willing to assist you with everything you need. Wifi is very fast and cheap €3 full flight. Prices are quite low for on board beverages and this is definitely one of the best low cost carriers flying in Europe. I would definitely recommend this airline as the prices are low but the service is still very good.

### "never use this airline again"
Barcelona to Porto. Getting a flight from Barcelona on 14th Oct 2019 which meant we got caught up in the protests. Despite being on time for the flight, the flight is cancelled. Which I can understand. But the staff told us to book our own flights because they didn't know what was happening and then all the staff left the airport and left us on our own. I booked my own flight, then to find my previous one was rescheduled. I stop 24 hours in the airport, and I wasn't asking for hotel or food compensation, just one of my flights refunded. Nothing I had to pay for book flights and unable to talk to anyone to fix the problem. I will never use this airline again.

### "they refuse to compensate me"
Barcelona to Gatwick. After losing my luggage and then finding it and delivering it days later they refuse to compensate me for any money I spent on clothes and necessities until my bag was delivered. I sent Vueling all required documents to properly file for compensation over 2.5 weeks ago. Now Vueling states that my luggage was returned within their 24 window in which no compensation issued.

### "on time and well-organized"
Paris CDG to Vienna. I do not understand the bad reviews. I took Vueling and Level from Paris to Vienna, and they are on time and well-organized. The crews are also friendly and attentive. Another plus: the baggage delivery in Vienna is very fast.

### "asking me for my France visa"
Gatwick check in asking me for my France visa, I told her My travel Document do not need any VISA entry to France. This Airline  refuse me without checking with airport immigration. This trip was traveling together with my friend, and I need to let my friend (British Passport) just go on fly alone to Paris. That night I have no issue using Land entry to France. It really waste my time and money for traveling from Gatwick. Vueling  Customer Services Department is useless.

### "Choose another airline"
Barcelona to Faro. Flights booked through Iberia in partnership with Vueling Airlines. Four of us flew from Barcelona to Faro for a wedding. We arrived at the airport two and a half hours prior to boarding. Flight was on time. Arrived in Faro to discover two of the four checked bags did not arrive in Faro. Queue behind us at the lost luggage counter indicated at least 10 bags did not make the flight. Vueling made no attempt to resolve the matter. All communications were redirected to their website. Website was useless with no change in status for six days. Status simply said: search for bags underway. We had no idea if they even knew where our bags were. We contacted Iberia Airlines, since we booked our flights through them, only to be referred back to Vueling. In hindsight we believe our luggage just sat at the Barcelona airport until the next Vueling direct flight to Faro (they fly there twice a week). Rather than get our bags to us quickly, they let us go without clothes, shoes, toiletries, etc. for the rest of our trip (6 days), delivering our bags to Faro the day after we left for home. Our luggage finally arrived at our final destination 11 days later and we had to go to the airport to pick them up because Vueling’s airline partner refused to deliver them. To be clear, the only reason we have our luggage today is because of the helpful people in lost luggage at Faro Airport. Vueling has done little to nothing to communicate or help. They really don’t care. We had to go out and buy things to wear to the wedding and for the balance of our trip. Vueling is now dodging reimbursement for these items. It’s simple — If you don’t want to reimburse us Vueling, don’t take 11 days to return our possessions. We understand lost luggage happens. What we do not understand is Vueling’s appalling apathy. Vueling could have quickly put our bags on another carrier’s flight to Faro. They did not. Vueling could have sent our luggage (and the eight other customers’ bags) to Faro Airport via a courier such as DHL. They did not. Vueling could have hired a driver to transport the all of the missed suitcases to Faro. They did not. Vueling could have contacted us with options. They did not. We are still awaiting reimbursement for our expenses and expect it to be a painful process. Vueling avoids contact with customers in order to sidestep accountability. It makes us question their attitudes toward all aspects of their business to include flight safety. Our recommendation — Choose another airline. ￼

### "they said it already had left"
Catania to Rome. There were 5 of us flying under 2 different confirmations. We had boarding passes printed and ready to fly from Catania to Rome on Oct. 26. On Oct. 25 we both received an email saying your flight from Catania to Barcelona on Fri. Oct.25 was delayed. We assumed it was a mistake since we weren't flying to Barcelona. We then tried to check into our flight and they said it already had left. We called Veuling and they said they sent us an email on Sept. 20 changing our flight to a day earlier. Neither of us had received an email yet we were getting them fine to tell us about the delay that day. They would do nothing to help us and they lady hung up on me. My husband tried calling and they said send in a request to get your money back. Had we received an email back in September we could have made different arrangements. Now we were stuck paying upwards of 600 euro to get back to Rome to catch our flight back to the US. I can't believe a carrier is able to do this. Hoping there is some kind of EU air complaint we can make.

### "never sent me any emails"
Barcelona to Stockholm. Vueling doesn't care about customers at all. My flight was booked for October 14th. When I came to check-in the woman said that my plane left on October 15th and was canceled on 16th, while when I logged in to my booking a couple of times before coming to the airport, it was showing that the flight is on 16th and it is on-time. Vueling never sent me any emails notifying about a date or time change. They weren't helpful at all and asked me not to cause a huge line behind me and also go and buy a new ticket. I submit a request for refund and compensation for my canceled flight to the company but got a refusal. I assume they're just lying in order not to pay compensation.

### "three times delayed"
Sevilla to Barcelona. Three times flying with this company and three times delayed and arriving late to destination. Perhaps one of the most unreliable flying company.

### "booking was changed"
Rome to Catania. My booking was changed. We booked a flight 5 days before departure and then received an email notification that our flight had been rescheduled for a morning flight. I followed the email instructions and went to "Manage my booking". I clicked on "Change flight" to see if we could change to a later flight. By clicking on "change flight" the rescheduled flight was submitted and confirmed. I did not even get a chance to go back to the page to request a refund. I emailed to the customer service to get a refund. Of course, my request was rejected. After booking, my flight time changed to an unsatisfactory time with no reasons and no alternative offered. I also tried to call customer service, but I gave up because I was on hold for almost 1 hour. Both their website and customer service were useless. Don't fly with Vueling if you can avoid it.

### "told me that it was too late"
I booked a flight from Paris Orly to Malaga. I was there on time to register and go through customs. After that, I bought a few things at the duty free and had a coffee. I arrived at the gate at 9:50 am (my flight was at 10 am), a little short but I just had to step into the plane (no luggage). When I arrived, the boarding agent told me that it was too late and that they had already taken my luggage out of the plane. I was so shocked I didn't know what to say. Even on international flights, I had never seen anything like this. No one told me when I registered that I had to be at the gate 20 mn before departure. And they say they made an announcement in the airport but I was at 5 mn from the gate and never heard my name. I was really furious. I had to redo everything and pay for a new ticket at full price. I really don't understand their policy on that matter. I was not the only who get tricked by this. A few other people were with me. Especially because they didn't try to accommodate us. After that, I responded to their customer survey but they never got back to me. So, for me, it was the first and last time I will travel with this company.

### "both times the flight was delayed"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I've ever flown with. In three weeks, I've flown them twice and both times the flight was delayed by over an hour, which put me at risk of missing my next connection. The staff and cabin crew are  rude and couldn't care less if there is a delay or if that's a problem for you. Complete lack of accountability, no explanations for the delays. Avoid this airline if you can. The worst I've ever known.

### "my bag did not arrive"
Flew Vueling twice on my Europe trip.The first flight they cancelled citing ground staff strike and did not seem it fit to inform me. Handed me a form at the airport saying i was eligible for a claim. At that moment i didn’t really care. All i wanted was to reach Barcelona as a friend was waiting and we had an onward flight to Ibiza. So i spent the night at a very substandard motel about half a mile walk from the airport with heavy bags. When i did write to them claiming compensation i got a mail replying i was not eligible for one. I decided to forget about it and enjoy my holiday in Ibiza. On my flight out of Ibiza the Vueling staff snatched my carry on personal luggage while i was entering the aircraft. I told them it had my valuable personal belongings and is not a check in bag. They handed me a tag and said i would get it in Rome. I did not like the way the bag was taken. i wasn’t even given a chance to lock it. I called the crew members and told them i need that bag on me. My connection in Barcelona to catch my onward flight wasn’t long enough to retrieve my snatched bag. The airhostess looked at the tag handed to me and said my bag was tagged to Rome and i would get it on arrival. On arrival in Rome, my bag did not arrive. I filed a PIR, my holiday in italy was ruined and its been more than 9 days now. Vueling has neither located my bag nor replied to me. Calling their customer service numbers is a waste of time. If they don’t find my bag i doubt any insurance will cover my loss.

### "Vueling delays caused us to miss our flight"
We were flying from Malaga to Barcelona and connecting with our Air Transat flight that was from Barcelona to Toronto. We allowed 3 hours in Barcelona airport for the transfer between flights. (1) The Vueling flight from Malaga to Barcelona was 1.5 hours late leaving Malaga. We figured we could still make our Air Transat flight as long as our baggage was on time. (2) We waited 2 hours in Barcelona for the baggage to be unloaded by Vueling. There was no customer service agent from Vueling to tell us first of all why the flight was delayed in the first place and secondly why it took 2 hours for our baggage to be unloaded. There was at least a 100 people standing around waiting for their luggage with many people who had missed their connections. The Vueling delays caused us to miss our flight to Toronto - so we had to pay: (1) for new one way tickets. The one way tickets cost us more than our original round trip tickets between Toronto and Barcelona. (2) for a night in Barcelona (3) an extra night in long term parking (4) an extra night to have our dogs looked after.

### "had no problems at all"
Paris Orly to Porto with Vueling Airlines. I honestly had such low hopes for this airline after reading other reviews. But I had no problems at all. The staff at the airport were nice, the staff in the air were nice. Every thing was normal and the flight was smooth. I would give them another go.

### "couldn’t care less"
Not Verified | Paris to London. I’m writing this review while stuck on the tarmac at CdG airport. Been here for 90 minutes, there seems to be a problem with the plane. No-one has said what is going on, no communication at all, no idea if we are going to take off or not. Staff chatting away at the front, couldn’t care less about the customers.

### "the most unreliable airline"
Vueling is the most unreliable airline in the world. Every time I have booked a flight, they automatically change my flight to several days before or after my original flight. Sometimes I am notified but sometimes not. When I am notified sufficiently in advance, I immediately must book a different flight with a different (more reliable) carrier so as not get close to the original fare. Admittedly, Vueling is good for refunding the ticket price but horrible for being reliable for the flight you desire. If I am not notified until just a few days before departure, then my travel plans are completely disrupted and I must find a more expensive flight for my original date if it exists. My advice: spend a few extra Euros and fly another carrier. It is far too risky. Who needs this extra stress?

### "will not get any compensation"
Palma to Dubrovnik via Barcelona. Our flight to Barcelona was delayed, so we can`t reach second part to Dubrovnik. In plane nobody gave us useful help. After waiting and running between gates in Mallorca, some passengers asked for water, they have to pay for this. In Barcelona Vueling have been sending us from one to another service desk. We spend more than 4 night hours waiting for any information and help. Nothing, even give us water was to heavy duty for Vueling. Finally we got information, that all hotels are busy and we have to book hotel for yesterday (was past midnight). They don`t care their own regulations. Now i got answer for ma claim. No answer, when they will give me back my luggage. No answer, when they will pay me back for hotel. Only answer i got is that i will not get any compensation, because fly to Barcelona was delayed only 2 hours. Doesn`t matter for them, I was in final destination 24 hours later, doesn`t matter for them both part of fly were provided by them!

### "OK for short hops within Spain"
Barcelona to Bilbao. Check-In at Barcelona is almost entirely self-service; you print your boarding pass and luggage tag from a machine, and then use another machine to send your bag to the plane. I had trouble figuring out how to use this, and when I finally found someone who I could ask for help he looked at me like I was an idiot before begrudgingly telling me what to do. Fortunately, the gate staff and flight attendants were much nicer. The seats were hobbit-sized, and I wouldn't want to fly in them for longer than the hour that I did. Fortunately, the flight was smooth and on-time, and my suitcase even beat me to the baggage claim in Bilbao. I think that Vueling is OK for short hops within Spain, but I'd hesitate before taking them on a longer flight.

### "Delayed by over 6 hours"
Gatwick to Barcelona. Delayed by over 6 hours. Poor information, no apology. No offer of compensation. No staff to talk to. Terrible boarding experience. Special occasion dinner in Barcelona missed. £100 not budgeted for spend at the airport. Truly terrible.

### "delayed or cancelled"
Dubrovnik to Barcelona. Living in Spain I have had to travel with Vueling a lot although now I generally avoid them if I can. It's a low-cost airline pretty much like any other and covers a lot of routes involving Spain but their flights are almost always delayed or cancelled - and I mean almost always. If you turn up and the flight is on time it is actually a nice surprise. Because of all the delays and cancellations I now take this airline to be atrocious and worth avoiding at all costs. In this case it was another two hour delay and didn't get any vouchers for food or drink either while waiting.

### "nice experience"
Not Verified | Alicante to London Gatwick. First time flying Vueling, and I was bracing myself for delays having read the reviews. Pleasantly surprised by the nice experience. The flight took off on time, we were flying on a Tuesday so the plane was quite quiet. Service was fine. The only negative - we'd paid extra to put our luggage in the hold but I was carrying a rucksack into the plane. The cabin crew wouldn't let me put the rucksack in the overhead lockers because it was reserved for other passengers with small suitcases. I just found this bizarre because had we not paid extra, they would have had an additional 4 cabin suitcases to fit up there. Didn't see why we were penalised for this. All in all, though, enjoyed the flight and would book again.

### "horrible service"
Barcelona to Geneva. Never fly with this airline. Such a horrible service from check in to boarding. We are now on the plane for nearly two hours with no explanation. I think they are trying to fix something but nobody knows when this is going to end. I will not recommend this airline.

### "would not recommend"
Not Verified |  It was my boyfriend who was traveling with this airline with a connecting flight from Paris - Spain. He made it to Paris just fine. The problems raised once he reached Paris. His second flight was supposed to be at 4:45, however, the flight was delayed until 8:00pm. Once 8pm arrived they were able to board the flight before being asked to leave the flight (as well as everyone else), as the plane was experiencing technical difficulties. There were no more flights that day, so they had to wait until 5am, the next day for the flight. Meanwhile, the flight service isn't able to provide them alternate flights, as people had the connecting flights afterwards and were missing them, to a hotel for the inconvenienced travellers. the customer service was horrible. No one was able to help at all. People had to miss their connecting flights and were told that they had to call the airline themselves, in order to figure out their situations. Opposed to the people who worked, and represented the airline. The workers themselves wouldn't even provide a contact for the travellers. Overall a very bad, and disorganized airline, would not recommend for anyone to take.

### " delighted with everything"
Not Verified |  Santiago de Compostela to Brussels. Absolutely delighted with everything. Punctual departure, smooth organisation, efficient service, professional crew. Will certainly recommend , many thanks.

### "They refused our compensation claim"
Not Verified |  Flying back from Florence after the most incredible holiday. We were checked in and an hour from take-off they cancel the flight. They offered flights 48 hours later and if you refused no compensation. What kind of a service does that! They refused our compensation claim. It costs us another £800 to get home the next day from Pisa. The following weekend we were flying back from Macedonia and they changed the return leg without notifying us and the alternative was 24 hours later. It costs another £1300 on flights and I won’t see a penny of it. Highly unacceptable, the worst customer service, I don't know how they can operate as an airline. Losing the best part of £2000 in over 2 weekends with no compensation is beyond ridiculous. I'm angry, upset and they won’t do anything about it.

### "a 100% fail rate"
If there was an option for zero stars thats what they would get. I've had the unfortunate luck to have different trips operated by Vueling 2 weekends in a row and guess what both times were cancelled. First flight got cancelled 1 hour before the plane was taking off and the next available flight offered to get us home was 2 days later, we opted to find our own way home as some people have to work, in doing this it meant we were not entitled to compensation but worse still they are making it so difficult for me to obtain my refund for the cancelled flights, I am still waiting. They send me a link for my bank details that doesn't work, it then says call customer services who guess what, don't put you through to an operator but hangs up on you. Absolutely disgusting. The second was only last weekend, we had an indirect flight from Macedonia to London, we arrive in Vienna and low and behold our second flight (operated by Vueling) is nowhere to be seen - we had an e-ticket that said 4.30 from Vienna to Gatwick and not one person in Vienna airport could locate this flight. We call Kiwi.com who we booked through and it turns out that Vueling had changed the flight without notifying us, it involved 2 more flights to get home, a 9pm flight to Barcelona, 7 hours in the airport then a 7am flight to London the next day. No email, no call, no nothing. We would never have found this flight, nor was it a suitable alternative. As such we spent 1300 euros on a different flight to get home I'm guessing we'll get no compensation or apology or cancelled flight refund from that either. Don't ever fly with Vueling, its often hidden so check when you book that your flight is actually operated by the person your booking with. This is the worst airline, in my 35 years I've never experienced a cancelled flight or massive ridiculous changes, then in the 2 flights I had booked with them both are a disaster. Thats a 100% fail rate.

### "customer service is beyond a joke"
Was supposed to fly Gatwick to Vienna for my wedding anniversary. Bought flights in March. Get an email mid-August informing me the flights had changed with a 16 hour layover in Barcelona! No good when you’ve got activities and a hotel booked the day you arrive. Ridiculous. They processed my refund to a closed credit card despite me telling them it wouldn’t work - they refused to listen. It has been almost a month and still no refund. Their customer service is beyond a joke, worse than anything I’ve ever experienced. They cut you off on the phone unless you know the magic combination to get through to someone, they don’t respond to emails for up to a week at a time and nobody cares on their Twitter. They are an absolute sham of a company. I hope they fail!

### "nice and quiet flight"
Not Verified |  Milan to Barcelona. Very nice and quiet flight, we took a plane that was just a month in fleet ... brand new. Kind staff annd above all they were able to speak in Italian which should not be underestimated by a non-Italian airline. Volo molto bello e tranquillo, abbiamo preso un aereo che era da solo un mese in flotta...nuovissimo. Pulito, gentili e soprattutto sapevano parlare in italiano cosa da non sottovalutare da una compagnia aerea non italiana.

### "be prepared to spend much more than you initially thought"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to Dubrovnik. So many hidden charges, including 25 euros to sit next to spouse! Keep reading. Online booked flight, didn't mention extra charge I was hit with upon submitting my payment (sitting next to my spouse, early cancelation option, luggage). In the end it cost some 150 euros extra. Return trip day - I had to pay 50 euros to bring my luggage back home, plus they said it was 2 kg overweight - it's 25 Euros more. Also during over a 2 hrs flight you don't even get water or coffee. Everything you want you need to buy. A cold, stale sandwich is 12 euros. Other prices are set accordingly. I will never ever fly with Vueling Airlines again. Generally, be prepared to spend much more than you initially thought if you want to receive things that are included at other airlines (1 piece of luggage, some beverage, snacks. Also be prepared for sitting away from the person you fly with if you don't purchase that option! ).

### "passengers behaved poorly"
Lisbon to Valencia. My criticism is mostly directed at how passengers behaved poorly on this flight, particularly while boarding, however cabin crew did the absolute minimum to manage the chaos. It was stressful and exhausting. Passengers seated at end of the aircraft had to put their luggage on the compartments at the front. Passengers with seats at front boarded the aircraft by the stairs at the end. The floor was very dirty.

### "another three hour delay"
Not Verified |  London to Barcelona. Shame on you Vueling! Yet another almost three hour delay due to 'technical problems' - these are hours of my life wasted and it's not the first time this happens with your shameful airline. I swear this was the last time I ever take this airline and I will make sure I tell everyone I know about how bad this is.

### "need to train their staff better"
Barcelona to Gatwick. My son has a severe nut allergy and despite telling four different cabin crew staff of this as soon as we boarded, it took over an hour for the cabin crew to announce this. (The flight was delayed for some time and the aircraft doors were sealed. The reason it took so long to announce this was 'they were making sure that the passengers were comfortable and dealing with luggage on the overhead lockers' I am so thankful that passengers did not bring their own peanut based food on board and start to consume them whilst waiting to take off as this would have been life threatening to my 13 yr old) After finally announcing that a passenger had a nut allergy. They then continued to sell nut based products. A very kind Spanish speaking passenger attempted to explain to the crew the dangers of my son going into Anaphylaxis. Once again all the cabin crew seemed oblivious of this medical condition and were not at all concerned I tried in vain to show the cabin crew what was written down in there own flight magazine but they still couldn't comprehend the seriousness of the situation. After a huge amount of heated discussion and some time into the flight all food service was cancelled. Vueling need to train their staff better and take the possible threat more seriously before we fly with them again

### "it was a good flight"
Bilbao to Gatwick. All I will say is that you get there. After having my flight with easyjet cancelled we booked with Vueling and it was a good flight. It was on time actually in fact no Vueling fights that day were cancelled and the seats were nice. Staff were nice. Its was 1 45 hr estimated arrival and we landed in 1 30mins which is good. Good legroom. Would recommend if you like cheap flights and get great value for money. I don't know where people get the bad info about them from. I flew with them about 5 times and no trouble. A slight delay with baggage missing.

### "delayed by just over 3hrs"
Florence to Gatwick. Flight delayed by just over 3hrs due to an accumulation of technical problems. Little attempt at apology when boarding did take place and the plane had to wait on the tarmac for 30 mins because there was no slot. With one notable exception the cabin crew were distant and unfriendly. I would not advise anyone to book tickets with Vueling.

### "customer service is poor"
Copenhagen to Paris with Vueling Airlines. The worst airline company I have ever traveled with. The plane was canceled because of technical reasons, as the pilot said "there are connection problems with one of our radios", and now they say that there cannot be any compensation because of extreme weather conditions. As well the customer service is poor on board and by phone/e-mail. No one would care about customers needs and all they said was that "you must contact Vueling customer service that is open 24/7", which is not.

### "we were denied compensation"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to Gatwick. Delayed 4.5 hours and denied EU compensation. Our flight was scheduled to depart from Barcelona on  at 19:40pm, everyone was told to start going through the boarding gate, we went down and on to the transfer bus, however we all locked on the crowded bus in 30 degree heat for 30 mins before heading out to the tarmac, then waited outside the plane in the bus for another 15 mins not knowing what was happening. Finally after 45 mins of sweating and crammed like sardines on the bus we were told we'd be heading back to the boarding gate as the plane was 'not okay to fly, there is an error'. We were also told there was another plane ready to take us to London. We got back inside the terminal and were told to go through security again, then had to sit and wait on the airport floor for hours and hours until another plane arrived. During the 4.5 hours of waiting, customers were barely told any information, we were finally given a sandwich and drink voucher and issued compensation claim information. In the end the flight was delayed and did not arrive at London Gatwick until 01:05 meaning it was 4.5 hrs late. We filled in a claim compensation form for €250 per passenger, due to the fact that the scheduled length of the flight was 1,140kms. This compensation is per delayed passenger in our party, resulting in a total of €500. However we were denied compensation, Vueling claimed the ' delay was caused by extraordinary circumstances' but refused to explain to us what that circumstance was, which they are required to do by law. We have contacted them numerous times for explanation but heard the same robotic response.

### " Worst ever experience"
Bucharest to Palma de Majorca via Barcelona. Extremely bad experience, first time flying with this company and it was a great fiasco. Have bought the ticket 2 months in advance just to be sure I’ll be on time for a cruise in Palma de Majorca which cost was 2000 EURO. Vueling kept the flight opened for overbooking and I was kept in standby list for 2 hours. Then I was announced that my flight will be rescheduled for the next day. As I was losing the cruise, I was obliged to buy another ticket for 1300 EURO one way to Palma de Majorca ( on the only flight that was available) just to make sure I will make it for the cruise. The company’s employees did not care at all about my urgency to get to the cruise. They didn’t provide any feasible solution so I had to find one by myself. I will never choose to fly with this company again! I will also advise everybody to keep away from this company. Totally not professional! Worst ever experience.

### "totally destroyed a suitcase"
Palma to Barcelona. Do not fly vueling; pay more and fly any other airline. Flight was 2 hours late, but the real issue was what they did to my luggage; totally destroyed a Briggs & Riley large suitcase. The shell was destroyed, cracked the entire bottom, my clothes were hanging out on the carousel. I have never seen anything like it. If you tried to damage a piece of luggage, you couldn't do what they did. Then we waited an hour to make a claim; we missed an expensive tour in Barcelona by 15 minutes, too late for a refund. They send you to their website using the claim # from the airport, to get replacement piece of luggage, tried that at least 7 times, nothing, no response, not confirmation, nothing. I called them from US, once I heard a person's voice, boom, it was cut off and the survey came on. If you want to be reimbursed, it's limited to 50 Euros. Bottom line, they do everything they can to get out of a claim. I saved on the fare, but lost over 700 Euros for the cost of a Briggs & Riley large suitcase and a Barcelona tour.

### "I had an awful experience"
Not Verified |  Rome to Amsterdam via Barcelona. I had an awful experience with this airline. The day of my flight they rebooked me without letting me know, on a flight that was a week after. I discovered it doing the checkin online. I called and they rebooked me on a flight the next day. I had to spend an extra night in rome paying the hotel myself. My flight to barcelona was delayed by 40 minutes and I missed my connecting flight operated by vueling too. I was rebooked on a flight the next day. They provided a hotel but the bus arranged by them was scheduled to depart from the hotel at 6:30 in the morning and my flight was at 7:10 (boarding time 6:30 :-)). I had to take a taxi (30 euros) that I was told it would be reimbursed. I got to the airport and I went to the check in desk for the reimbursement. I was told that I would need a voucher and they could not print it and that I should ask for the reimbursement via their website. When I arrived in Amsterdam I waited for my luggage but it did not arrive, so they even lost my luggage. So, in conclusion a trip that should have taken a couple of hours (I was supposed to be in Amsterdam on the 22/08 evening) took almost 2 days (I arrived in Amsterdam on the 24/08 at lunch time). They rebooked my flight without sending me an email, they didn’t provide transportation from the hotel to the airport, and the fate of my luggage is still unclear.

### "This service is absolute rubbish"
Not Verified |  Rome to London Gatwick. Paid for a premium seat in the front for my wife and I to get a bit of extra room. Fine and dandy. However Vueling has lost both our big suitcases. It seems they were sent to Santorini. We have tried numerous times over the past two days to get some sense out of them but no joy. They do not return emails nor phone calls at all. This service is absolute rubbish.

### "No care about passengers"
Bought these direct Gatwick to Vienna flights since February for a convention in Vienna in September, and for our surprise with less than a month to our trip they sent an e-mail informing this flight has a connection now in Barcelona, and the return connection is 8 hours waiting. Customer service didn't what to help or refund my ticket. One of our traveller is a speaker. No care about passengers.

### "our only carry on bag was taken"
Amsterdam to Barcelona. This is the worst airline there has to be. After paying triple the normal ticket for Optima ticket, our only carry on bag was taken from us to be put in the cargo because the cabin was full! It is your policy and I paid for it. Horrible seats. More than 40 minutes delay.

### "absolute bottom of my list"
Not Verified |  Nice to Barcelona. This airline is at the absolute bottom of my list. My 1st flight delayed by 6 hours. Staff useless, no food, drinks or compensation. 2nd flight was cancelled and changed to day later. 3rd flight cancelled and changed to 5 hours later which makes me miss my connecting flight. As a budget traveler I would really say avoid at all costs.

### "What a lousy airline"
Lousy first experience with Vueling (Level) Our suitcase got lost on the Vueling flight from Amsterdam to Milan Malpensa. More than a month later we still don't have our suitcase back. Everything can be booked online, but complaints must be submitted by written letter and delivered by a postal service! What a lousy airline.

### "I tried to call and cancel"
Our EasyJet flight was canceled 2 hours before the flight, leaving us in a huge lurch. I mistakenly booked a flight on Vueling (google flight listed the incorrect time on its website, and I didn't catch it prior to booking). As soon as I received the confirmation, I tried to call and cancel. The customer service wasn't open. I tried to message them, but because nothing fit the offered selections, it wouldn't take my message. We ended up on a train and I called as soon as I could (about 4 hours later). The customer service "manager" told me that I had to email within 2 hours about the mistake, or I was out of luck. I now know there is no "email"; there is also no way to provide them a letter. I sent a letter explaining the situation via federal express to the corporate headquarters, and it was refused. I can't believe Spain allows this type of customer service. I understand I made a mistake to begin with, but having no opportunity to even try to rectify the mistake is crazy. For what it's worth, surprisingly, EasyJet was absolutely terrific in providing a refund and dealing with us.

### "Currently stranded in Mallorca"
Barcelona to Nürnberg. This has been one of the worst airline experiences I have ever had. Vueling overbooked our flight home from Barcelona to Nürnberg and my boyfriend and I did not receive a seat. Then they booked us a flight from Barcelona to Mallorca but they did not manage to book the flight from Mallorca to Nürnberg. Currently stranded in Mallorca waiting to see if we can even get a flight out today. I will never fly with them again.

### "Two delays within 30 days"
Lisbon to Barcelona. Two delays within 30 days, first one was due to “an operational issue” cost me half a day to return home from Barcelona to Beirut. Second one was on the 8th of August, 1.5 hours delay then a sudden/powerful stop of the takeoff, the reason was tire maintenance, cost us around 4 hours in total. It hurts that it’s the only direct flight between Beirut and Barcelona and I feel obliged to take it so that I enjoy the 4-5 hours back home every time I go on vacation. To note: the staff is super friendly but it feels they don’t have the tools and utilities to provide a class service.

### "not within the scope for a refund"
Not Verified |  Seville to Dubrovnik via Barcelona. This is the worst airline I've flown. They have no sense of customer service, and they have no sense of compassion towards their passengers. We were so early at the airport because our flight was supposed to be at 8 am. The staff were rude, and when the plane started to have technical issues, they  avoided talking to the passengers. We waited for more than 6 hours with no update and after asking us to change boarding gates for two times, they eventually cancelled the flight. They only gave us 6 euros worth of food. And when we demanded to be boarded to the next flight, they told us that since we will miss our connecting flight to Dubrovnik (which is with the same airline), they booked us to a later flight and will just provide us hotel accommodation. So we waited for another 5 hours, eventually, when we arrived in Barcelona, they booked us in a hotel with less than 3 hours to sleep before we needed to go back to the airport. We missed a whole day in Dubrovnik, because of the poor service of this airline. Then when we emailed regarding our refund, they said that because of a technical issue beyond the control of the airline it is not within the scope for a refund. My advice, just avoid this airline.

### "it is not worth your time or your money"
NotVerified |  Barcelona to Dublin. Do not trust. Flight delays and Lost Baggage. I’ve flown with over 20 different airlines in my life and my experience with Vueling has been by far been the worst. The moderate and budget friendly pricing is extremely attractive, but it is not worth your time or your money. Everything about this company and airline is terribly constructed, from consistent delays in flight times to lost luggage and awful customer support. I ended up spending more money than it would’ve cost me to buy a premium airline ticket, I should’ve never tried to save money and trusted Vueling. They lost my luggage halfway across the world, took no responsibility for it and left me to pay for all the necessities I needed just to get by. Do not travel with Vueling, it is not worth the headache.

### "Put in a claim in for a delay"
Malaga to Cardiff on 6th June. A bumpy flight, plane diverted back to the departure airport, and informed by the pilot there is a fault with one of the engines after 20 odd minutes in the air. Waiting a long time back in arrivals for a second time for a replacement plane to arrive from Barcelona and a voucher for a sandwich, crisps and drink. Arrive at destination 271 minutes late and tired. Put in a claim in for a delay due to a technical issue of being nearly 5 hours late to the destination by way of an online form on the carriers website which doesn’t work.

### "I enjoyed the short flight"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Bilbao. They let me check in my bag 20 minutes before the check-in had begun. The ground staff at gate were lovely, departure time was 8:20 and had a smooth journey to Bilbao. Although the legroom was pretty poor I enjoyed the short flight. The total flight time was 1 hour and 34 minutes and landed before schedule. We were walked off the plane via bus and collected our bags in the time of 5 minutes.

### "couldn't see when we were leaving"
Not Verified |  Hamburg to Barcelona. It all went really well until the last moment when our flight was delayed 1 hour 30 minutes but it wasn't the worst - the worst was they gave no information so we couldn't see when we were leaving. Boarding on the plane was ok and seats were fine and at Barcelona airport our suitcases went out fast.

### "said I had to check my bag"
Barcelona to Ibiza. Poor is an understatement! My buddy and I were backpacking through Europe and rather than do the train, we decided to fly country to country. The cost was the deciding factor: $200 for all of the flights versus $2,000 for the train. I now know why!! We took a Vueling flight from Amsterdam to Paris. They voluntarily asked for people to check their bags. My buddy and I checked our bags voluntarily. We arrived in Paris and couldn't locate our bags. As I waited in the long line to file a complaint about losing our bags, my buddy checked another baggage claim and sure enough there they were. After that, my bags stayed with me. Until we flew Barcelona to Ibiza. My backpack fitted  in the overhead compartment not to take too much room up. The gate agent said I had to check my bag, even though it fit on the same model of airplane the prior three flights or I couldn't take the flight.

### "lost luggage for the entire flight"
Flight from Gatwick to Florence. 40 mins late to board, then waited on the tarmac for 90 minutes. Very pleasant onboard staff. When we landed, there were no announcements but we found that they had lost the luggage for the entire flight - not just 1 or 2 people - everyone on board had arrived without their luggage. This is truly a fresh experience for me after over a thousand flights to date. Congrats to Vueling on their innovation. Everyone had to queue and fill out forms for a further hour. Two days later they have no news on our luggage. We are returning home from our business trip without our clothes. We have enjoyed washing the same set of clothes each night in the hotel sink during out visit.

### "put this airline in black list!"
Venice to Paris. The airline didn’t send me booking confirmation on the email, I had only screen shot of it, I didn’t get email that flight was cancelled, so had no time to arrange new, find out about it in the last minute in the airport. Vueling provide to all passengers new ticket for next day, hotel, food and transportation but it doesn’t worth it as plans was ruined. For myself I’m going to put this airline in black list!

### "Worst airline ever"
Brussels to Barcelona. I give Vueling 1/10, because the website does not allow for negative marks, otherwise it would have been 0/10. Funny enough, I did not even get on the plane. And I will now try to never ever get on a Vueling plane. While standing in line at the gate with the aircraft visible, my 21h20 flight was cancelled 5 minutes before foreseen boarding time. No explanations given but a quick message through the speakers « go back to departures hall and find a booking desk ». Knowing there was an SN Brussels Airlines flight for Barcelona the next morning at 06h40, I first made sure to quickly book one the 4 last remaining seats with my smartphone. Not having checked in any luggage as per a good habit, I then just left the airport, avoided mingling with the 200+ passengers who were now angrily shouting at the booking desk in the arrivals hall, and I checked into the nearest hotel. About 2h later, I received an email from Vueling with my boarding pass to Barcelona the next day, leaving in the late afternoon from ... Paris Orly, about 375km from Brussels! Worst airline ever.

### "bag was wrecked completely"
Rome to Dubrovnik. I flew with Vueling as my travel agent booked it for me. My new bag was wrecked completely. Basically, no care what so ever was given to my bag. Vueling do not have a counter at Dubrovnik and none of the numbers on their website worked, so I recorded with baggage delays/lost+found, I was advised it would be very unlikely that Vueling would pay for damage. A damage report was filed and I was advised to provide this to Vueling. After chasing vueling for weeks they advised that they will not cover as I have a damage report and not a product irregularity report! Do not waste your hard earned money on this joke of a Company. They have no care for your items, no apology, no reimbursement of damage, with no Customer Service at all.

### "3 hour delay in my trip"
Barcelona to Mykonos. Worst airline in Europe. Expecting a 3 hour delay in my trip. It seems that's their practise and they do nothing about it.

### "I lost my baggage"
Barcelona to Paris. I lost my baggage and they are being very irresponsible in helping me to retrieve it. I was supposed to receive it yesterday and I haven't received it until today afternoon. The customer service has no idea who to contact regarding the same.

### "delayed, and then cancelled"
Basel to Barcelona. Our flight from Basel to Barcelona was initially delayed, and then cancelled. Judging by their customer service, this airline has poor management and action plan system. Vueling does not have any representative at the airport, all customer relations were handled by Swissport. Hence, all queries we asked regarding the cancellation were replied with vague responses or prompting us to ask Vueling directly. 4 hours after the cancellation and with no clear guidelines, Vueling decided to reroute our flight to the next day from Geneva instead of Basel. We had to travel by bus for 3 hours from Basel to Geneva (organised by them). Once we arrived at Geneva airport, no staff was present to help us with accommodation or transport. Thus, we had to figure this out ourselves by inquiring the information desk. Claims and airline statement request were a nightmare too.

### "crew attentive and informative"
Not Verified |  Check in online was straightforward and, unlike some airlines, we were able to check in weeks before our flight. (I just wish the ground crew smiled a bit more but the conditions of the airport probably accounted for that?) Unfortunately, our flight was twenty minutes late arriving in Barcelona; however, they were quite keen to board us fairly quickly to get us away as soon as possible. What happened next was out of the airlines control, but of the ATC in Marseille who were apparently working on a go slow basis. We were kept informed with the situation in Spanish and English; we sat on the apron (so we could depart at a moments notice) where the temperature climbed to approx. 36 Celsius but the crew were prompt in providing cool water and they kept the air conditioning working. Despite an annoying delay, Vueling did their best to ease the situation, and we couldn't fault them for that. As soon as we departed, the crew remained attentive and informative.

### "my booking was canceled"
Barcelona to Kyiv. Booked my flight with Vueling company three weeks before departure. My credit card was charged, confirmation email received. Four days prior departure I tried to check in, but received an error message. After a few attempts to my shock I came to find out that my booking was canceled with no notification sent to me! No email of cancellation notification was sent, but I keep receiving their add/news emails. Vueling customer service is unresponsive, no one answers neither phone calls, nor online chat. There is only three days left before my scheduled flight, and no way to contact Vueling to find out what is going on! Needless to say that all my travel plans are tight up to this flight! Literally the worst flight experience ever!! Don’t understand why they are still on the market. Have no words to express my feelings

### "dysfunctional organisation"
Luton to Florence. Pretty awful - flight to Florence delayed shortly before by several hours, then completely cancelled as we walked into the airport. I could see from the staff behaviours in the "zoo" that followed that it was only going to get worse so at the significant expense I felt I had little alternative but to book an alternative flight the next day. Further texts from them indicated that even the replacement flight they had provided to get customers to their destination, effectively a day and a half later, hadn't reached its destination the next evening. I have written to them for compensation, but no response received so I doubt they actually intend any compensation (in contravention of their obligations and consistent with other reviews). Opinions on Vueling I now see are consistently bad so if you actually want to travel as intended I would avoid them; it makes you wonder what the regulator actually does when such dreadful organisations can continue to operate from the UK. No service, no staff service capability, no effective regulation, no compensation and ultimately in our case and many others no actual functioning aeroplane. The thing is if this is indicative of their operational capability, God knows what is going on behind the closed door of what could only be considered a self-evidently dysfunctional organisation.

### "poor customer service"
❎ Not Verified | Madrid to Ibiza. Vueling is by far the worst airline to fly on, very poor customer service, rude, and not helpful at all. Our luggage did not arrive at Ibiza and no one to answer or provide support. The supervisors were not even available to address issues, completely oblivious to customers. To add fuel to fire, they have a super small metallic box for putting hand luggage into to test the size of onboard cabin which is designed to make people pay 70€ extra money. Disgraceful airline, I would not recommend anyone to fly with Vueling!

### "worst low-cost airline"
❎ Not Verified | Hamburg to Barcelona. As I live in Barcelona, I use Vueling a lot and after many many unsatisfied flights, I decided to write a short review. For most flights to and from Barcelona Vueling is the cheapest airline but if you have a few more Euros to spare, go with someone else. It started to be a running gag between me and my friends on how this airline is always delayed. Often by many hours. Without much help given you will have to wait for them to tel you last minute that the next flight got cancelled again or this flight is delayed by 2 hours. Absolutely worst low-cost airline, in my opinion, they won’t last for much longer.

### "carry on bag did not fit their sizer"
Rome to Palermo. I’ve flown many flights, with many different airlines, all with the same carry on and checked in bag (for the most part). On my Vueling flight, my carry on bag did not fit into their sizer at the gate. They made me pay €50. As I’m walking to the airplane, I look at other passenger’s carry ons and most were the same size if not larger than mine. Extremely upset. Would never recommend this airline.

### "Stay away from Vueling"
Ibiza to Barcelona. Absolutely the worst airline I have ever been on (and I've flown a lot - been to over 40 countries by air). The flight was delayed for many hours, with no updates passed on to customers as we all waited in line and refused to change the official screen at the gate with updated take-off times. Finally, after waiting two hours in line they told us the flight was delayed indefinitely. Called and tried to change the flight to get on a mother one as I absolutely had to get to BCN to make a connecting flight to Canada. They refused to help. Collectively, half the passengers made their way down to the Vueling customer service counter at Ibiza airport and they refused to help, even refused to give us meal vouchers even though we had waited upwards of two hours now. Customer service counter got rid of us customers by telling us that the flight was now boarding and that the plane was fixed. Rightly so, we all ran back to security went through it and ran to our gate only to find out that they had moved the gate for the flight. This wouldn't have been an issue but the gate they published for the updated flight was not even right. It was a gate for a Ryanair flight to England, not our flight to Barcelona. Only through rumours, we found out where our gate actually was. I've never seen such poor communication or customer service. Finally, we started boarding about 5 hours after the originally scheduled take off time. Took another 45 minutes to get the flight airborne, and landed around 6 hours after we were supposed to. But wait there's more: this extreme delay made me pick between a bad and even worse choice; since the flight was so delayed I had to pick between abandoning my checked luggage in Barcelona due to the Air Canada counter being closed since it was so close to take-off, or simply miss my flight back to Canada easily costing me another 1200€ for a last minute one way flight. So I had to make the choice and decided to leave my luggage behind at the carousel hoping that Vueling would own up to their tardiness and ship my luggage to Canada. Boy was I wrong, upon landing in Canada first thing I did was call Vueling customer service to start the long process of tracking down my bag only to find out they are closed. What type of airline customer service line closes? Especially when there are active flights! So I searched how to send them an email and finally found one for lost baggage (not really lost, but they had no other option). So I sent an email and immediately a robot responds with a generic response basically saying we will look into it. Fast forward to Monday opening hours and come to realize there is no way to talk to an agent unless I select to book a flight! So I select this option, explain my story; that I need to be transferred to Vueling Barcelona airport baggage claim and they respond with a "we have no clue how to contact them". Imagine the rage I am in! A supposedly first world airline? So it's now clear their customer service agents are not properly trained or even briefed, and that there is simply no way to get in contact with their baggage department in Barcelona, they even suggested physically going back to Barcelona to grab my luggage! Are you kidding me? So right now, as I write this, I'm finding a way for a friend of mine to physically go to BCN airport and send it to me via FedEx costing me over 600$. Stay away from Vueling.

### "highly advise against flying with Vueling"
I highly advise against flying with Vueling. I had a flight from Faro to Mykonos that connected in Barcelona. Upon arrival at Faro, we were advised to check our luggage by the agent at the Vueling desk. Our flight to Barcelona ended up being delayed, which resulted in us missing our flight to Mykonos. The next flight we were able to get on did not arrive until 04.30, and Vueling lost almost half of the flight’s luggage. As a result, I needed to purchase over €200 of things in order to get by until my luggage was found, since Mykonos is quite expensive. When I picked up my luggage 3 days later at the airport, I asked the Vueling agent what was needed to file a claim for the items I purchased, and she said all I needed to do was keep the receipts and file the claim within 21 days. Shortly after, I attempted to file the claim, but was turned down because I did not keep my luggage tag (the agent made no mention of this requirement!) I have been fighting the issue with Vueling for the past week, but every time I email them they just send an automated email essentially saying they cannot help without the luggage tag. Their customer service is very poor and they have been very unhelpful to me. I will be sure to avoid flying with them in the future.

### "disgraceful customer service"
Edinburgh to Barcelona. Avoid at all costs. Delayed every time and disgraceful customer service. The worst customer service I have ever come across

### "useless canned responses"
Heraklion to Barcelona. The company sucks. Sometimes you have to book with them because there's no other company for your trip (that's why I travel at least once per year with them) and they don't even offer customer support. There's no way to get in contact with them unless you call an extremely expensive number and on their facebook page you get completely useless canned responses.

### "never fly with them again"
Gatwick to Rome. Vueling staff just disappeared. We were sent to a gate in Gatwick airport and nobody from the airline ever showed up. It's been almost 2 hours and we are all still waiting. I will never fly with them again.

### "FA's were courteous and professional"
Birmingham to Barcelona. I would not normally have booked with this airline as I do like to use OneWorld members to benefit from my tier status. However this flight was direct from my nearest airport so I decided to give it a try. The aircraft was pretty new and I’ve not flown a NEO version of the A320 family. I booked the cheapest Basic ticket which included no check in baggage and no seat selection. However I was fine with my seat allocation of 29C outbound and 29F return. The outbound priority boarding was announced but at Barcelona there were three queues for groups 1-3. Interestingly at Barcelona I was assigned group 2 despite having the cheapest ticket, I assumed this might have been due to being located at the rear of the plane, but boarding was from both front and rear doors. The leg room was fine for me, but I a short 5 ft 2’. The seats being very slim might have helped with the sense of space. The FA's were courteous and professional and the flights departed and arrived on time. I didn’t bother purchasing any F&B but the prices looked reasonable. So overall a good flight, I just wished they were part of OneWorld so I could have benefited from lounge access.

### "a 12 hour nightmare delay"
Booked Vueling from Florence to Barcelona due to price, what we got was a 12 hour nightmare delay. Meant to depart 2.25pm and arrive Barcelona 4.10pm, got to airport and noticed other flights delayed to 4pm due to air strikes in France and people stressing about connecting flights, our flight was still on time (so we thought). Sat at the gate awaiting boarding got to 2pm and nothing was happening, people crowding the desk asking questions so staff translated to english that flight wouldn't be leaving until after 4. We found seats in the cramped tiny airport and waited, it was very uncomfortable and hot in there. Got to 4 and still nothing so went to desk again and were told plane will now be arriving at 5, they weren't updating the board until 30m ins after giving us a new time. Got to 5, then they said 6 and gave us each a voucher to use on one item at the cafe. We shared a sandwich and held onto the 2nd voucher in case we were there longer. Other delayed flights to London, Paris, Amsterdam had all left at this point and it seemed our flight was the only one this disorganised. Checked with the desk again and they said we might get buses to Pisa Airport, no time frame given or explanation as to why, very alarming to hear. Got to 7 and gate changed but still no updates given re buses and people started lining up as the info board said 'boarding' however line wasn't moving. Got to 7.30 and noticed some coaches outside, still no updates from staff, they don't seem to use the P.A. I got emails from them saying the flight was delayed due to strikes but nothing else no arrival time. People slowly started moving onto 1 of 2 coaches, assumed we must be going to Pisa. My partner was told to put hand luggage (backpack) in the bus hold as it was 'too big', then we found out the bus would be 1 hour and this bag had our water and books in it which was irritating, the drivers and airport staff stood around discussing directions for ages, buses finally left after 8. We got to Pisa airport and were dumped out the front in the bus bay, we thought we might board the plane straight away but no. Everyone was confused and stressed racing around trying to find their bags as the drivers and airport staff had vanished and no one was unloading the bags, everyone was speaking Italian and there were a lot of suitcases left behind as people assumed the airline would take care of it. We hauled some bags out for others, got ours and everyone raced into the airport, walked all the way around to departures but no check in counters open so we were all confused and exasperated trying to work out what to do, the flight was listed on the board as leaving at 10 but it was already 9 and I thought no way would we be on time. Finally we heard the voice of an exasperated airport worker shouting "stop yelling at me" in english, She said we all had to go to one counter to drop our bags, people then realised they left their bags at the buses outside and raced back to get them including a young single mum with a child who were both in tears, there was no assistance from staff at all! We filed through slowly and dropped the bags went air side and waited to board, was already 10 and didn't get on plane til after 11. Waited 20 mins on tarmac, arrived after midnight got to hotel 2am. Lodged claim with Vueling, refused compensation as it was "out of their control". So lucky we didn't have connecting flight. My parents had similar problem flying Santorini to Athens, heed this warning & pay more for decent airline!

### "don’t care about their customers"
Nice to Ibiza via Barcelona. Customer service is not existing. I lose a flight because they are late the want to recharge for changing the flight, no excuses nothing. Flights were late and no information whatsoever. Agents with arrogance and don’t care about their customers.

### "no information flight was delayed"
Not Verified |  Malaga to Barcelona. Malaga Airport facilities good. Vueling check in queue doesn’t distinguish if already checked online or not. Long but moved ok. However at gate there was no information that flight was delayed until well after departure time. We travel light - checked in a 9kg bag each (2 of us). Noted that they allow 10kgs carry on. Along with handbags etc. Ludicrous policy not enforced until the end of line of people boarding who all had their carry on removed to go on next flight. Not very happy people and screaming going on. With only a small handbag we were allowed to take it. The crew never encouraged passengers to place soft smaller carry on at their feet so no wonder lockers full. Flight left an hour late (can’t fully remember ). Made up some time to land 40 minutes late. Then the worst thing. After 50 minutes of not one item on said carousel I went to investigate. Brushed off and said it’s in the system should be 5 minutes. Asked that they announce that. Did so and luggage appeared 10 minutes later. Can see why people cram their bags as carry on with that delay. Now worried as have a booking in three days to UK with connecting train! Doubt I will make it. Plane good. Seats good. Didn’t purchase food.

### "rude customer service"
Not Verified |  My companion and I purchased the premium seats for a flight from Ibiza to Barcelona. upon checking in on the premium line we realized that bags were not included in the price. The staff who checked us and was also pretty rude about the fact that we were in the wrong line and had not paid for bags. We definitely thought we have paid for bags with our premium seats and if we hadn't we wouldn't have purchased them. Paying for bags at the check-in cost us twice but it would have if we had bought bags hours in advance. It cost about 60 USD to ship each regular sized suitcase. The misunderstanding is one thing but the rude customer service really puts a damper on it. The flight was delayed at least 30 minutes and the wait at baggage claim was long. The flight attendants weren't particularly courteous either. It must not be a fun airline to work for because nobody seems happy.

### "poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Asturias to Basel via Barcelona. The website didn’t let me do the checkin, got the tickets at the desk in Asturias. I got middle seat people in the flight Barcelona/Basel, tried to change it in Asturias, Lady over there said can’t do try in Barcelona. Lady in Barcelona said can’t do, you should have done it in Asturias. So, basically I am willing to pay more for my window seat (and they said there were available) but there is no possible way to get it, poor customer service.

### "Vueling is not really low cost"
Prague to Paris. Vueling is not really low cost : with its seat selection charges and use of secondary terminals - you end you spending more and wasting more time. Im surprised such a poorly managed airline is still operational. Avoid at all cost, even if it means you have to pay more with others.

### "the flight was decent"
Not Verified |  We flew to Granada on Vueling. I have heard some bad things about them, however, the flight was decent. The seats were the European standard, and did not recline. However, on a longer flight, this could be an annoyance. I did not get any food, however, my friend got a sandwich for about 10 euros with a sandwich and a drink. It looked okay, but for the price, it was not served with care, as well as the look being shoddy. Overall, the boarding process was messy, the flight was okay, and the seats were good for a short hop. I woukd reccomend Vueling on a short hop, and on a longer flight, not so much.

### "a delay of 2 hrs"
Barcelona to Munich. After a delay of 2 hrs last Sunday on the same route again a delay of at least 2 hours - no info at gate. no service desk at airport. no weather related reasons. airplane on in-bound route had damaged overhead luggage storages fixed with duck-tape. Luggage took 45min on the belt. Never again - completely unreliable.

### "company policy not to refund"
Barcelona to Manchester. I paid for priority boarding and paid extra to selected a better seat and to use the VIP lounge on Departure from Barcelona back to Manchester - also paid for cancellation insurance. Waste of money on all accounts as Vueling staff didn't seem to care where anybody sat on the plane and I didn't get the seat or one like it that i had paid for. Also after checking in for my departing flight on the 25th if June i was told the VIP lounge had been booked for my arrival - I arrived in Barcelona on the 12th June at 23:30 and the vip lounges close at 22:00, also who would want to sit in a VIP lounge when you arrive at your holiday destination! It doesn't make sense, so I called Vueling  to clear this mess up so I could you the vip lounge when i had requested and intended on my departure but was told it could not be rearranged and that it was company policy not to refund!

### "no notion of customer service"
❎ Not Verified | Bilbao to Barcelona. The first thing that should be noted about flying with Vueling is that they have no notion of customer service and experience at all. Every detail about the trip - from buying your ticket through their shady app where they pull extra costs out of nowhere, to having to guess where to grab the stuff you didn't take in the cabin with you at a huge airport - is cheap and amateurish. Due to their lack of training, the ground staff have no skills and suffer panic attacks for trivial reasons. They bark at passengers instead of treating them with respect. Security check was an absolute mess and it felt like the whole staff had a severe form of attention disorder. The worst part about flying with Vueling is managing to enter the plane at all since it's absolute chaos and their staff can't do their jobs without having constant panic attacks. The actual flight was OK. The crew's behaviour was a bit unprofessional since we could hear them laughing constantly behind their paper-thin curtain. But they have a pass since their employer is a joke.

### "Very poor customer service"
Vienna to Olbia. Long delays with zero explanation or communication. Told ‘you just have to wait’. Not even basic common courtesy which really isn’t that hard. Very poor customer service.

### "my Luggage was lost"
Barcelona to Napoli. During self-check-in for a flight to Barcelona on 10.06.2009, my Luggage was lost due to their staff at the airport. Of course, it has not been found, moreover, the so-called airline support service Vueling told me that they cannot help me (after 11 days). Lost and found office in delivery airport refused to give me the report so I stayed in foreign country without my bag and without any help. I have never encountered such a disregard and unprofessional attitude.

### "delayed for more than 5 hours"
Not Verified |  The worst experience! Had a flight to Mykonos with a stop in Barcelona from Madrid. At first, the flight was delayed by 1 hour, with the plane already waiting at the gate. After all that time, they have randomly decided to change the destination of the aircraft to Menorca, instead of Barcelona. More than 20 people on that plane had a connection to make in Barcelona and the plane was completely booked. Absolutely ridiculous! How can you change the flights destination after making people wait for so long? The flight I was supposed to take was delayed for more than 5 hours. The flight attendants have not even apologized to the customers. What a disrespectful company with no value of their customers. No surprise everyone is writing terrible reviews.

### "Inflight services are zero"
Lisbon to Barcelona. I fly with Vueling 10/15 times each month because is mainly the only option for business travelling from Barcelona. Vast majority of my flights are late. Seats very uncomfortable. Inflight and land personnel with terrible attitude. Inflight services are zero.

### "Terrible experience with Vueling"
Milan Malpensa to Barcelona and we missed our connected flight Barcelona to Palma. Terrible experience with Vueling. Me, my husband and other passengers not related to us – were refused boarding. We were refused to board the plane, even though we’ve checked in online 1 day before, and passed passport control and were waiting at the gates in the queue. And all of us were blamed by the airline that it was our fault and we have been waiting at the wrong gate. The truth is that Vueling at the last moment before boarding changed the gates which was originally on the screens and didn’t announce the change. Instead they announced gate 7 to Barcelona, which we went to (apparently it was added second plane/flight by them). There were two identical flights by Vueling from Milan to Barcelona at the same time from the same terminal of Malpensa. As we discovered later – from the gate #7 and gate #1 (after gates changes were amended). We came to the gate 7, Which was announced and we gave our boarding passes and passports to the lady who checked them at the boarding desk – she said “wait in the queue” , she didn’t even mention anything that we are at the wrong gate and wrong flight. Vueling sold way more tickets than they could board and that’s why had to create this mess and to confuse passengers to make sure to get rid of us, as there were no more seats on the plane as we understood. They didn’t announce a last call either – to invite right passengers to the right gate – because they were interested to get rid of us, not board us. The airline then delayed the flight (from gate 1) for 1.5 hour, because they needed time to find our suitcases to kick them off the plane, but they didn’t have seats to board us which would be faster. We’ve spent all night searching for the new tickets and had to travel from Malpensa to Linate airport to catch the new flight we booked, which cost us 409.70 EUR plus 25EUR luggage, plus bus + taxi fees. We also lost lots of nerves and one day of our 4 days holidays at Mallorca and we are very disappointed with this fact and will demand compensation from Vueling for us. We have never ever had such a terrible experience and were amazed how the situation developed.

### "5 days before we got our luggage"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Lisbon. Vueling managed to lose both our suitcases, as well as 50% of the other passengers on board. Apparently, they just forgot to load an entire truck's worth of luggage. Vueling responds like they couldn't care less. They left us at the destination with no explanation of where our luggage was. They did, in fact, know exactly what had happened, but decided they'd withhold the information from us. It took 5 days before we got our luggage back, all the while Vueling would tell us nothing. It was only when we received an email from the airport, telling us it had arrived, that we knew to pick it up. We, of course, had to purchase toiletries and clothes during this time, and Vueling's customer's service team said they'll reimburse for such expenses. So we made sure to keep hold of receipts. Flash forward to arriving home and filing a claim for this, Vueling decided to wriggle their way out of this by claiming we didn't have the original luggage tag receipt. We had a full page report from the baggage claim process, with our passport info, flight details, and baggage tag information. Basically everything they would possibly need to verify us in their system. But Vueling could not care less about honoring their mistakes and reimbursing customers They are legally bound by the Montreal Convention to reimburse us for this, but presumably, most passengers, including us, don't have time to pursue further legal action. Therefore this is their cheapest, most effective response. This was the final straw for us, but we have had other bad experiences flying with them.

### "It was a good experience"
Madrid to Ibiza. Although the flight was delayed for almost an hour, the aircraft was brand new. I was travelling with INF and Vueling gave me priority all the time and in general all the staff was very helpful. It was a good experience.

### "worst flight experience"
Gatwick to Paris. Pay the extra $50-100 if you can manage. This was the worst flight experience of my life. Vueling Air almost cost us our honeymoon, definitely cost us the opening World Cup match, a beautiful hotel, and an entire day in Paris. It was an absolute nightmare from checking in to landing. I could write a Russian novel on the complete and total ineptitude of this airline, but I will summarize why you should avoid this airline at all costs: 1. Check in line was absolute chaos. People had no idea where to be, who to talk to, and how long it would take to get boarding passes. It took one hour to get boarding passes 2. This delay forced a horde of passengers to make a mad dash to the gate as the airport screens indicated that boarding would be closed within minutes 3. We all get to the gate in a frenzied state only to be told that our flight was delayed by one hour 4. We wait for an hour at the gate. No word from the 2 Vueling employees on where our plane is and how much longer we will have to wait 5. After 2 hours had passed, the employee announced that our 1:00 PM flight had been delayed to 9:00 PM...audible gasps and shock fill the room. People flood the two employees 6. The employees indicate that we can get food vouchers $12 per person at the Information desk 7. The two Vueling employees get their bags and leave the gate as they are at the end of their shift. No explanation on why there was a delay. We are told by one sympathetic employee, "good luck and keep on checking the screens. 8. Because it took them 2 hours to inform us that the flight was significantly delayed, options for the Eurostar and another flight are impossible. We are forced to wait until 9 PM without any degree of certainty as to whether or not the flight would be canceled 9. Around 8PM a large group is forming near the Information desk about the status of our 9 PM flight. The woman at the info desk told us to call the Vueling number (which went straight to voicemail, btw) and to keep checking screens for updates on cancellations 10. The woman at the info desk leaves for the night. The large group continues to wait until another British Airways employee says our flight should be good to go at 10 PM. They are just waiting on another plane flying from Portugal 11. No word for another hour until the screen changes and our flight is scheduled to leave at 11 PM. There's no employees at the gate. 12. At 11:30 PM, two exasperated employees come to the gate to begin checking in passengers. One of the employees got into an argument with the other employee and exclaimed, "I QUIT! and left the ticketing gate within 10 minutes. There is now only 1 employee checking folks in 13. We finally board at midnight and arrive in Paris at 2 AM My issue is not with the delay as to how Vueling absolutely failed to provide any level of transparency or communication to its passengers. Look, I know this is not a top airline, but it is completely unacceptable to treat your customers this way. By stringing us all along for hours, they robbed us of any other choice. My husband and I missed the opening match of the Women's World Cup ($400) and essentially an entire day of our honeymoon. We are now attempting to be compensated for our losses and Vueling is not cooperating despite EU laws and their own policy regarding delayed flights. I cannot believe they are allowed to still be in business. You can take your chances with this airline.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Ibiza to Barcelona. Horrible experience, after arriving on time for my flight they told me at the check in point that they have a problem with the door and are moving half the customers on the next one. Obviously they overbooked the flight. After standing in line for 1 hour they put me on a flight that is 4 hours after my actual flight. After waiting in the airport for 4 more hours. They ended up delaying that flight one more hour,

### "Worst airline ever"
Gatwick to Paris. Worst airline ever. Flight cancelled and no other reason was given. No person was in charge or can tell us what happen. Wait for 3 hours also no proper answer given to us

### "very good low cost airline"
A very good low cost airline in Europe! We flew in May 2019 twice - from Paris to Barcelona and from Barcelona to Majorca and both times we were satisfied. You can buy tickets through the application Skyscanner or Vueling (or their website). Their website really slows down, but you need to wait, because the desktop version has many features that are not in the mobile application. The staff is friendly, if at the airport you don’t manage to do something yourself, they help. Luggage. Here is what is written on their website: and further: and finally: However, they do not find fault if the weight of the luggage is more than 10 kg, I had 14 kg and they did not check. They have 3 types of tariff - Basic, Optima, Timeflex. We took two tariffs, as my wife had two baggage - hand luggage and a bag of 20 kg (shopping in Paris and Barcelona), and I only have hand luggage. I bought myself a Basic fare (hand baggage 10 kg) + paid extra for choosing a seat (to sit next to my wife), and I took Optima to my wife (hand baggage 10 kg + checked baggage 25 kg + choice of seat). After payment, the confirmation arrived and the boarding tickets immediately arrived. They can be printed, but you can also not print, you can simply register through the QR code on the phone, which we did. The ticket shows how to fold it, everything is very simple and convenient. The cost of choosing a seat depends on a number of: 21-25 rows - 4 euros. 16-20 rows - 5 euros. 11-15 rows - 6 euros. 10 row - 14 euros (20% more space here). Front rows (5-9 rows) - 9 euros. Space Plus (More space and priority landing - 2, 3, 4 rows) - 17 euros. Space One (More space (+ 20%) and priority landing - only 1 row 1 st) - 21 euros. I paid extra for 8-15 places, in terms of saving these are the best places. The choice of Basic fare + seat extra charge was cheaper than buying Optima tariff. Therefore, if you do not have large luggage, choose this rate. Both times that we flew this airline, the flights were on time. Both times we flew for short distances, so there was no power. Advice - if you are hungry, buy yourself a meal in advance at the supermarket, as the airports are more expensive. If you don’t care about money, you can eat at the airport or on board. Cons of the airline. the seats do not recline, because of this, that it takes up space, because the airline simply rammed a lot of seats in the cabin. My legs are comfortable (I have a height of 175 cm, but there were people in the salon and they were 180-185 meters tall and they were clearly not uncomfortable). Since the flights are short - 1-2 hours, this does not cause discomfort, in extreme cases, you can walk through the cabin. When buying tickets of two different fares, like with us (Basic + Optima), you cannot choose two fares at once, you must first buy a ticket for one fare, because again find the same flight and buy a ticket for it. And what if there are only a few tickets left on this flight and everyone wants to buy it? Then one of you will fly (who already bought a ticket), and the other can stay. Therefore, it is necessary to do all this very quickly, within 1-2 minutes. It is best to import all of your data and your partner / friend / wife to their website, then the program itself adds it.

### "Don't use these clowns"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Porto via Barcelona. I booked a flight on Skyscanner to go and see England play Holland in Portugal. I booked a flight to Barcelona and a connecting flight to Porto. The plane was so late arriving at Gatwick that it would mean that I would miss my connecting flight to Porto and therefore the game. The customer service people were less than useless, I couldn't get near the desk for angry passengers from an earlier flight that was still delayed from the day before. Moral of the tale? Don't use these clowns.

### "they oversell their tickets"
Luton to Amsterdam. Worst airline, don't consider using this airline because they oversell their tickets. On top of that having the worst customer service and absolutely no one to speak to. Such a useless airline.

### "Spacious with legroom"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Barcelona. Spacious with legroom, paid extra for baggage allowance. Flight was late and no announcement on ground until we boarded the plane. Very poor customer service.

### "never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to Florence. Worst experience with an airline. Booked this flight with my wife for our honeymoon - we were bumped from the flight because the airline overbooked (intentionally) - and were moved to the flight the following morning. We were not told we would be bumped from our flight until we were at the gate and ready to board. To make matters worse, they offered to arrange a hotel room for us for the night - however, the hotel was an hour away (even though Barcelona airport has a connected hotel), and the ride to the hotel provided to us was a bus that had broken air conditioning. We had to cancel a wine tour in Florence (non-refundable), and pay for one night’s stay in Florence which we didn’t even use. In many ways, Vueling ruined an entire part of our honeymoon. The most insulting part? When I told their customer service rep at the gate that this was my honeymoon and I would appreciate any help she could give to get me on a flight that day, I was told “it’s not my problem.” I will never use this airline again, and I strongly suggest people consider taking legal actions against them if they experience the same unethical booking practices that I encountered.

### "Bad experience due to delays"
Not Verified |  Bilbao to Barcelona. Bad experience with this airline due to delays. I flew from Barcelona to Bilbao and returned back after 5 days. I had 1 hour delay in my first flight and another 1 hour delay in my return flight. Don’t be fooled with the colors and fancy screens of this airlines.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to Alicante. My partner and I arrived at the Barcelona airport about an hour before our domestic flight. We asked two Vueling employees where to check in for our flight, and they pointed us to the self-checkin machines. We tried to check in, and the machine did not work. So we asked another employee, and she pointed us towards the 1 open checkin window manned by a Vueling employee. There was a line of about 30 people, all waiting at this one window. (Meanwhile, there were at least 5 other unmanned windows.) While waiting in the line for over 30 minutes, we tried to use the machines again, and they didn't work. When we finally got to the front of the line at 1:29, the employee told us that we could not get on the flight because checkin had closed at 1:25. She told us we should have gone to last minute check-in around the corner. No one told us this option existed. Three different employees failed to give us the correct information, and checkin closed while we were waiting in line to check in. When we went to the customer service window, the Vueling employee refused to put us on a later flight for free, and instead tried to charge us over 200 euros. He was incredibly rude, saying that we were lying about what time we arrived at the airport. I tried to file a claim on their website, but it does not work for me. I called their number, and the woman told me to use the website to file a claim. When I told her the website doesn't work and that's why I was calling, she hung up on me. Vueling is a terrible excuse for an airline with the worst customer service I have ever encountered.

### "awful lack of information"
Florence to Gatwick. Worst airline have ever flown with. Delay going out to Florence 1st May at gate then again sitting on plane for an hour before getting told there is a technical fault, but only told after many of us passengers kept asking. No apologies from Cabin Crew or Pilot. Then on return flight home Monday 13th May again left sitting on plane for 50 min without any information about why the delay, asked Cabin crew who just shrugged their shoulders. When we eventually took off and Cabin member was walking through I stopped him and asked why the delay and why was we not informed. He explained the delay which I said ok I understand that but why could you or the Pilot not just take a min to tell passengers, again just a shrug of shoulders. The Pilot did eventually after an hour into the flight explain and say sorry but that was only due to complaints by passengers about the awful lack of information. Then to cap it all the drinks service stopped before 12 rows could be served, admittedly we where due to land in 20 mins but Cabin crew just stopped serving and walked away again with no explanation or apology. Will never fly with this airline again, tried to send them an email yesterday to complain, just kept rejecting it and tried to contact by phone, again no luck.

### "value for the money extremely poor"
Amsterdam to Rome. The flight was on-time, but that was the only positive aspect of the trip. First, I booked two weeks in advance and the price was quoted as 110 USD, but when I got to the purchase screen, I saw the fare had more than doubled to around 230 USD one-way. Easyjet was much cheaper, but I went with Vueling hoping that IAG standard would prevail. Due to Vueling's small carry-on dimensions, I checked-in online and paid in advance for one checked bag to avoid the risk of being asked to gate check for a much greater fee. When I arrived at the airport 2 hr before departure, I was confronted with a tremendous check-in queue. There was no separate "bag drop" line, unlike most other carriers. Passengers were yelling at the airline staff in Spanish, only to have the agents claim that they didn't speak Spanish. It turned out many passengers in line were booked on a canceled BCN flight. Finally, after an hour standing in a barely moving queue, the check-in desk asked for any passengers traveling to Rome to come forward to check bags. I arrived at the gate just as boarding began, but had I not arrived at the airport 2 hr in advance, I might have missed my flight. The in-flight experience was dismal. The cabin was very tattered, and the seat pitch was the tightest I have experienced on any airline. A school bus would have been more comfortable. Service was desultory. Despite the nearly 2 hr flying time and lack of turbulence, the cabin crew only managed to serve half the cabin before retreating to the galley. I was never offered the chance to buy any food or drink the entire flight. Upon arrival, baggage took about 35 minutes to come off the belt. Overall, they did get me from A to B safely and on-time, but I felt the value for the money was extremely poor. The experience was worse than Ryanair or Norwegian, at a much higher price!

### "Will fly them again"
Travelled from Barcelona to Beirut. A pleasant flight. Had three seats to myself. Check in very quick at counter. Seats had no adjustment though. Will fly them again.

### "seats so small
Venice to Paris. By far the worst airline you could fly with. They try to trick you on their website to pay over-priced seats, when you have right to a free seat! And let’s talk about these seats, they’re so small, if you’re a grown-up taller than 160cm you will struggle.

### "not recommend to anyone"
Not Verified |  Palma to Zaragoza. Flight an hour late, won't let me bring my carry on onboard then staff threaten to throw me off the flight when I say I have valuables I need to remove from my bag. Will never fly again. Surprised they even got 3/10 in my opinion. Will not recommend to anyone.

### "highly recommend Vueling"
Not Verified |  Alicante to Gatwick. This was my first flight with Vueling booked via  BA. On Time boarding made simple. The staff were helpful & friendly. The aircraft was fairly New and very clean. Once everyone was on board you could sit were ever you wanted if there were seat’s available. I would highly recommend Vueling.

### "you will pay additional fees"
Rome to Barcelona. Totally a scam. We ended up paying for our seats after booking the flight. We could not get our tickets until we paid an additional fee. Then we paid $50 per checked bag. You had to buy everything on the flight including bottled water. A cup of water was free, but we had to ask 3 times to get it and the flight attendant acted irritated. Never will fly this airline again. Read the small print and beware you will pay additional fees.

### "overbooked by Vueling"
Our flight was overbooked by Vueling, no explanations given. Staff at the boarding gate were extremely rude. Absolutely no customer care: we were simply told we didnt have seats on the flight and were left to our own devices to sort out a flight back home. We had to find the Vueling office at the airport and ended up having to wait 7 hours at Barcelona airport (for a 90 minute flight!) as Vueling had overbooked all flights that day. All members of staff we dealt with were very unhelpful - none wore name badges (what a surprise! ), extremely unprofessional service. Avoid Vueling! Our tickets were not cheap and the service we received was appalling. That was our first (and definitely our last!) time using this airline.

### "Poor all round"
Rome to Gatwick. Poor all round. I was asked to put my hand luggage in the hold due to "running out of space in the lockers". How they determined this I don't know as when I arrived at my seat the overhead locker was empty. It would appear they just pick suitcase style hand luggage at random to be put in the hold. The flight was inexplicably delayed for more than 30 minutes for no clear reason with no correspondence from the crew or pilot.Seats are your standard easyJet esc ones, reasonable enough for a short haul flight. Food is limited and expensive, as is drink. No WiFi. The fact they don't let you check in until a well prior to the flight in an attempt to get more money out of you encompasses all this airline appears to care about.

### "I am very disappointed"
Oporto to Lille via Barcelona. I am very disappointed with Vueling for losing my bag on a flight where I had the right to hand luggage and at the last minute was forced to send my bag down with just a hand written tag. Had to spend my business trip with no clothes and basic necessities I hope Vueling find my bag and return it, it’s the least they can do to minimize this enormous inconvenience

### "Seats cramped"
Gatwick to Alicante. The only thing this airline did for us was get us from A to B. The air stewardesses were grumpy. Seats cramped. We paid for front seats to exit quickly but boarded last (because of their boarding policy) so nowhere to put cabin bags. If we were to use them again I would need to pay for seats and priority boarding to avoid the problems we encountered, and by that point you are at BA prices which is a far superior experience! If you can avoid this airline please do!

### "they seem to be late"
Barcelona to Madrid. Flight starts boarding late. Then two attendants block the jet way making passengers check their carry-on bags. I was back packing so ignored me but had to wait while they processed people. With the jetway heating stuck on full blast, no fun. So flight left gate. Was a full flight and they could have done all the carry on bag checking earlier in the gate area. They wonder why fly runs late. Only flown them a few times but based on my 4 or 5 flights, they seem to be late.

### "staff were exceptionally rude"
Our flight Lille to Barcelona was full and we could not fit. After travelling from Lille to Paris by taxi to take a replacement flight, it was 1.5hrs delayed. Along the way the staff were exceptionally rude.

### "third time the trip is delayed"
Not Verified |  Brussels to Barcelona. It is a disgrace that this being my third trip with Vueling in three months this is the third time that the trip is delayed without any notification from the company unless being asked to. It is very frustrating not only that they are so often late but also that it seems that they do not want to take responsibility by avoiding telling the customers the real updates, which are bad news

### "No organization at all"
Absolute worst airport to fly Vueling out of! People behind the counter at the gate are clueless. How does a customer that pays extra to be on priority boarding get boarded on the plane with the 3rd group? No organization at all! The plane itself is comfortable, yet space for luggage is limited. Will never fly with Vueling, or at least pay extra for anything. Complete robbery. I paid for a service that did not apply to my trip, and all I get is a shrug shoulder.

### "Cheaper than Ryanair and better"
Not Verified |  Birmingham to Barcelona. Apart from luggage Vueling didn't have hidden extra charges like Ryanair. Most crew were miserable but one was superb and made up for the others. Cheaper than Ryanair and loads better.

### "most definitely use again
Barcelona to Manchester. Vueling was the only airline available to me that matched my cruise. I was extremely hesitant as it was my first time flying alone for a while and first time with this airline. Check in was smooth, aircraft clean okay leg space Window seat that was allocated to me with the option to change my seat free of charge. Great luggage allowance Flight was brilliant we arrived early. Pilot made a couple of announcements. Brilliant flight would most definitely use again.

### "hand luggage was too large"
Rome to Gatwick. I was treated very rudely by the staff at the airport. My hand luggage was too large to be boarded, which understandable, I was charged 50 Euros (one-way) to board my hand luggage. The bag was also measured after boarding the plane and the strange thing is that I was allowed to take this hand luggage on the outbound flight but not the return flight. I usually fly easyjet where my hand luggage usually fits and I wrongly assumed the size of the hand luggage was the same. I believe 50 euros is outrageous as a additional charge for a sub 10kg luggage. It is safe to say I will not be flying Vueling anymore as I was appalled by the way I was treated and the outrageous extra charges and excessively small hand luggage dimensions.

### "do not do cancellation"
I booked a flight Barcelona to Lisbon through expedia and was trying to cancel my flight. Expedia deferred me to call vueling directly. They don’t have a 24 hour hotline for cancellation and I am calling from the US. They charged for international fee for the call. The prompts was hard to maneuver in order speak to an actual person. The number above is open only from 9am to 9pm. I spoke to an agent and told me that they do not do cancellation even if you call within 24 hours.

### "claims are no longer accepted"
Not Verified |  Kaliningrad to Barcelona. After the cancellation of flights to Kaliningrad (Russia), we write a claim on the Vueling airline website for returning the cost of the tickets we have already paid, we get the answer “the company regrets the cancellation of the flight, compensation in accordance with the European Court of Justice clause 5.3 is not provided, because that the reason for the cancellation of flights due to congestion air traffic. He regrets, but does not apologize for the spoiled vacation, and I would like to return the lost money. Okay, if the plane spent the fuel, the company suffered losses. Just six weeks before our flight, the company canceled flights to Kaliningrad, but did not report this to e-mail, continuing to send advertising. Further companies are blocked account. To the claim from another mailbox comes an automatic answer, that claims are no longer accepted. It turns out everything is fine, as long as everything is fine, otherwise, you end up with money, they will not return it to you.

### "Again delayed flight"
Not Verified |  Valencia to Amsterdam. Again delayed flight (2hrs 57 minutes). 3 out of 5 I flew Vueling last 6 months. No info given, a voucher for dinner (9.64 euro). Arrived in Amsterdam 00.57, no bus/ train available anymore at this time. I had to take a taxi to my home town (117.00 euro).

### "lady said we were too late"
Not Verified |  We purchased round trip flights from Barcelona to Malaga for February 2019. We were arriving from Oakland on Norwegian on a ticket we booked separately. We had about 2 hours from the time we landed until the Vueling flight left. But, what with debarking, getting the luggage, and going between terminal 1 and 2, we did not arrive 40 mins prior to the flight. When we landed, I attempted to contact the airline only to be sent through a phone tree maze and was unable to contact an actual human. We arrived at the kiosk to check our luggage with 20 mins before the plane left. When we went to scan our boarding passes, the machine would not take them. The lady said we were too late, we were suppose to be there 40 mins before. Our explanation that we were arriving from USA and had just got there was met with no sympathy, no concern, simply an explanation that we were too late. She directed us to the customer service counter on the far side of the entrance. There again, we were told that we should have booked our two flights on one purchase, but because we had done it wrong, we had missed our flight. There was a later flight. They said we could take that one, but we would be charged for that flight 110 € each plus 10€ for the airport in addition to the charge for the original flight (there were 4 of us traveling together). When we attempted to reason with them that the charge was too much, they explained they were giving us the ticket exchange rate, not the cost of purchasing the ticket right out. That cost would be 120€. To add insult, the next flight left 20 mins earlier than stated on our tickets. We almost missed it while waiting for the airport to release the gate for the flight (released 5 mins prior to the start of boarding).

### "much better then I expected"
Munich to Barcelona. When I read negative comments about Vueling Airlines, I was hesitant to fly. But the flight was much better then I expected! There wasn't any problem during boarding. It was really systematic (The window seats were boarded first and the aisle seats were boarded the last). The take-off was almost on perfect time. But the flight was rather bumpy because of the frequent turbulence. When a flight attendant realized I felt nervous, she offered me water, seated me in the front and kept eye contact with me throughout the flight. Landing was also punctual. Overall, it was a very convenient flight when you think about the value for money. I will definitely fly with Vueling Airlines again.

### "very poor airline"
London Stansted to Amsterdam. Cancelled flight. Vueling agreed to refund the cost of an alernative flight provided I supplied a VAT invoice. However after multiple lengthy calls, only supplied half the cost. They simply do not pay anything unless seriously chased. Very very poor airline.

### "definitely fly again"
Palma de Mallorca to Barcelona. Checking in was quite fast, the aircraft was clean, staff including cabin crew were friendly. The flight was on time. Would definitely fly again with Vueling.

### "they deliver exactly what you would expect"
London Gatwick to Bilbao with Vueling Airlines. Based on word-of-mouth, I had my reservations about travelling with this carrier, but they’re not too dissimilar to their orange, low-cost counterparts. I arrived on time on both legs of my journey, and prices for in-flight catering were comparable with other companies. Only two criticisms: the pop music they play in the cabin during taxi, takeoff, approach and landing is tedious and hasn’t changed in at least two years, and the cabin temperature is uncomfortably warm. Other than that, they deliver exactly what you would expect from a low-cost carrier. I would however be disappointed to receive this service had I booked with BA, which I understand happens on some UK routes.

### "not fly with them anymore"
Lisbon to Amsterdam. This is the 2nd time i am flying with Vueling and again the plane arrived late and the departure was delayed until we left 2 hours after planned departure. Because of this I missed my train to go home and had to book a hotel just like the last time. There was no explanation about the delay neither at the airport nor in the plane. And we were only told about the delay on the screen half an hour before the flight. Also when we were finally in the plane nothing happened for a while and the delay got longer. My guess it's that Vueling pushes on their schedule and just accepts that they can't make it most of the times. They know this and try to keep it within 3 hours so they don't need to pay the passengers. Offcourse as this is common practice nobody cares about explaining anything. Well I think having constant delays should worry am airline, but they don't. Their slightly lower prices compared to e.g. TAP don't make up for this annoyance. Unfortunately because of my time planning this was the only flight for me to be able to catch my train in time, knowing upfront that they will not be in time anyways I should have just chosen to fly later worth a different airline as it didn't matter anyways. I will not fly with them anymore.

### "would not not let me move"
Gatwick to Rome. Worst airline service ever. Staff rude and lying to me about flight being full. They would not not let me move to empty row of seats once the plane is fully boarded

### "well worth the price"
Barcelona El Prat to Paris Orly with Vueling. We flew on a new aircraft that was very clean. The flight was very smooth and the cabin crew were very friendly. It was very cheap and well worth the price.

### "extremely clean cabin"
Paris Orly to Barcelona El Prat. No problems at all, easy to use app, and extremely clean cabin. The flight attendants were very nice and the flight was very smooth. The price was very good at around $130 dollars round trip. Would definitely fly Vueling Airlines again.

### "Worst airline I have flown"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have flown. I know low cost is what it is but when all my fellow passengers (we were a group of 80 people traveling on an organised holiday) and my wife and myself are the only pax who were not seated together I asked why? The first answer I received is that the tour organiser booked it this way. At the gate I was told that if I wanted to sit next to my wife (together as the young lady told me) I would have to pay for a seat change. Now if an airplane is full I could understand we can not sit together. We took off and I had 3 seats for myself and so did my wife. Beside the fact that the seats are extremely uncomfortable and as you have read earlier service is good to 0 on this airline I would not advise anybody and I will not anymore fly Vueling Airlines.

### "anger and frustration"
Palermo to Barcelona via Rome. I cannot find words to express the anger and frustration that having to deal with this airline has given me. They are incompetent, unhelpful, unorganised, with extremely devious practices. Their flight are constantly late. Their communication is horrible. Their staff unhelpful and rude. I will always do my utmost to avoid dealing with them ever again in the future. I had a consistent horrible and late experience flying them over a half a dozen time. Once their website didn't work so I had to call the call-centre and they charged me 80% higher prices because i was "using the call centre service" when I had no choice. When I told the "lady" assisting me she said: "well if you don't like it you can go get your flights somewhere else". My only other option was having to get connecting flights with another carrier with 5 hours of waiting and the connecting airport. Another time I was with my whole family and another family with 2 young kids waiting to board, at the time of departure, we were told flight was delayed by 1 hour. After an hour waiting we were told flight was delayed another hour. After the second hour we were told that the flight was cancelled. For another hour no body told us what to do. We then were told to go to the other side of the airport where we had to queue for another hour where there was one assistant serving all the 200 passengers trying to put people in future flights. Avoid it at all cost.

### "I went to change my flight"
I was planning a trip with my friends to go to Lisbon from Madrid. We all got together to make the reservations at once so that nothing was wrong. We made sure that the flight number and times were the same so that we all traveled together. Little did I know that they use the same exact flight number to correspond with the same time on the following month. So instead of booking a flight back to Madrid on the same day it was a whole month later. When I went to change my flight they were going to charge me over 50% what I paid for the 2-way trip to begin with. I thought it would be a good idea to contact customer service to see what they can do for me because the flights were so confusing to begin with and they told me a new price to change my flight. This time they told me it would have been 75% of what I previously paid for the 2-way flight so they were no help at all. What I did to start with was better than what they had offered. I only a lot so much money I’m allowed to spend on trip like this and I had to spend 1/2 of this just to get my flight changed. This whole situation was very discouraging to use the web site again to book a flight.

### "cancelled without any notice"
Rome to Amsterdam. On 11 Jan 19 Vueling cancelled our flights without any notice. We were sitting at the boarding gate and suddenly it appeared cancelled. We had to get to Amsterdam that day, so we had to fly with another airline. They couldn’t reschedule our flight for another 2 days. The ticketing office told us that we would be refunded our tickets and compensated Euro250 each. I was concerned about this but they confirmed that we would be compensated for sure. Now Vueling is sending emails that we are not entitled to the compensation they told us we owed.

### "had to postpone our departure"
Barcelona to Athens. Customer service inadequate! Due to death in the family we had to postpone our departure for one day we had to pay all surcharges. The staff on phone customer service suggested we pay everything and than claim back charges on ground of extreme circumstances. By e-mail we were informed (after quite a bit of back and forth mailing) that since we boarded the plane nothing could be done.

### "Just don't fly with them"
Manchester to Vigo via Barcelona. The flight was delayed for almost 3 hours, causing me to miss my connection in Barcelona (single ticket trip with Vueling). The next flight was the following day - causing me to miss my special night in a Parador Hotel. On arrival in Vigo, my bag was missing. The Customer Service throughout was appalling with the result that I spent the next 3 days of my holiday trying to chase down the bag. On the fourth day, I drove back to Vigo Airport to retrieve it myself. Both claims - one for the flight delay and one for the very modest purchases due to baggage delay - were logged in good time and all relevant documents provided. Despite this, I have now been waiting 6 months for a resolution - emails are now simply being ignored. They should not be allowed to get away with this, but my modest claims are not worth the time and expense of trying to engage legal help. Just don't fly with them.

### "lovely aircraft and staff"
Vienna to Venice. Low cost but lovely aircraft and staff. All is good, and very nice. See you next time Vueling Airlines. Fantastic and great journey with Vueling Airlines.

### "rude and very disorganized"
Paris to Gatwick. It's the first time that I use this company a day probably will be the last one. The flight was delay more than one hour with no explanation and when I was boarding they asked me for another additional identification. Apparently my passport (new passport, 100% valid) wasn't enough, luckily I had the driving licence with me. I'm from Spain.and the flight was from Paris to London no additional documents needed. The staff was rude and very disorganized, shouting at people and losing control about the checking.

### "a disaster airline"
Barcelona to Gatwick. Absolutely a disaster airline. Took 100 euros for our 2 bags and didn't refund it as the flight was cancelled. Took all day to let the passengers know that Gatwick airport was closed and didn't offer an alternate route to London except to passengers that jumped up and down and made a lot of noise. We could not understand their English very well and finally a bloke came out at around 5 p.m. and said we could stay the night in Barcelona at their expense. We spent another 3 to 4 hours in a line before being sent to a bus area (no toilets) where there were 4 or 5 coaches but not ones that we could catch. Waited outside in the cold for about 2 hours before a coach pulled up and then it was bedlam. Every man for himself to get his bag on and a seat on the bus. Finally booked into the hotel about 10 p. m. and then up at 4.30 a.m. to get a taxi that we paid for to the airport to get a flight to England with another airline. Absolutely hopeless airline too scared to be honest with it's passengers.

### "no customer service"
This flight was most enjoyable and no problems with the airline going to Barcelona. The flight however from Barcelona to Gatwick with this airline on the 20th December from Barcelona to Gatwick was cancelled due to a supposed drone sighting at Gatwick. Vueling Airlines would have known there were serious problems when we were booking in our luggage at 10 a.m. and paying for it at that time also 100 euros. They then proceeded to book us on 2 more flights that were cancelled. Absolutely no customer service and very bad line up for 4 hours at 6 p.m. at night to get our bags back! Very poor service

### "is a waste of your time"
Amsterdam to Barcelona. Again a flight delay by Vueling, so far 2 hours off. This is a normal situation with this airline unfortunately. Very poor on communication- i had to go into google flights to understand how much was the delay - if is there accurately stated why is this airline not providing this basic info to travellers? Vueling is a waste of your time.

### "delayed then cancelled"
Gatwick to Florence. Terrible airline, was firstly delayed for 2 hours then cancelled. After cancellation we were redirected to the next flight which caused about a 5 hour delay to our travel. At the boarding gates we were told we can claim compensation for the delay and that we should have received food and drinks vouchers. When I actually claimed for that flight, Vueling denied the claim because of extraordinary circumstances. After persisting the reason, they stated it was due to the crowded flight departures.

### "directed to a family line"
Not Verified |  Flew Vueling Airlines from Barcelona to Athens, Greece. While at the check-in station my family were directed to a family line, however the flight attendant kept refusing and telling us to move to another line since the children in our family were above the age of 5, despite being told numerous times that another attendant had told us to move into the family line. She had told us that she didn't believe our words and that we should move back and she only did the work after a commotion began happening at where we were at.

### "never ever again"
Ámsterdam to Barcelona. Terrible experience. I am used to flying with Vueling a lot but it feels as the years go by that they go more Lufthansa in terms of prices and more Ryanair in terms of customer service. Ground staff was very rude, incessantly screaming at us to get out of the way when we were all lined up against a wall already. They ignored questions from me and other passengers or flat out gave us information that a few minutes later proved to be false. They made us check our luggage in just because we were the customers who didn't pay for seats. We were told there was no space on the plane for small suitcases but when we got on there was a lot of space. When trying to ask something else I was directly threatened of being removed from the flight and gate if i didn't stop bothering them. As I said, usually fly with them several times a year. Never ever again, paying a bit extra money for an airline that treats you like humans and not cattle is worth it. I wish I could give a negative star rating for ground staff.

### "I have not received any money"
Paris to Gatwick. I am a American soldier currently stationed abroad in France, and on our only leave I scheduled a trip through Vueling to go to London from Paris on October 31st. I traveled for over 24 hours and paid a lot of money to get on my 0700 flight, and I did everything right from checking in on time to being at my gate when I was supposed to be. My traveling companion and I were told we were not assigned seats because we were the last to check in, but they promised us there would be room on the flight. After all the boarding, however, the flight attendant just shrugged his shoulders and told us quite rudely that we would not be able to get on the flight. From that moment on the customer service agents were extremely rude despite being in the fault. We were told we could either wait til 8 pm, and miss all of the tours we had paid for in London that day, or we could pay 400 euro to get on the only other flight with openings that day. Neither of these options were reasonable for us. At this point Vueling promised us 250 euro compensation and a refund for our flight if we would sign legal paperwork accepting their decision not to let us board. They then send us on our way, again quite rudely. We had to figure out transportation last second, buy plane tickets day-of, and spend our entire day at a layover in Dusseldorf Germany as we could not afford any other flight options. As if this treatment was not good enough, it is two months and ten days later and I have not received any money from the company. I have emailed them many times, and they either blow me off, claim the incident never happened, tell me that they’ve already paid me, or tell me that the money is on its way. I have given them documentation of the events to include the signed legal paper work many times as well as given them my bank information. They even provided a document of a refund that they sent my travel companion that did not match the money he received. Currently they are claiming the money is on its way, but it has been two weeks since they last transferred  the money. They have continued to be extremely rude even though again they were at fault for the events. Their lack of compensation is not only horrible customer service, but also illegal according to European law and the legal contract we signed. . I do not know what else I can do at this point.

### "still no compensation"
Rome to Catania. We were due to fly at 6.45pm. At 5pm we were informed that the flight VY6138 was delayed by 2hrs. Then we were informed of a second delay. Finally the boarding process. There we stood for nearly 1hr and suddenly they started scanning boarding passes. This took us to a bus, where we stood for a further 30 minutes. Around us everyone was talking in Italian and they seemed angry. I asked if they had news and one man said he received an email saying the flight was cancelled. Interestingly the bus driver never got on the bus, so we got off and waited to hear more. It was so hot and crowded on the bus, there was no air so it was a pleasure to get off it. A young fellow from Vueling told us the pilots had done their 8hr shift, so there are no pilots until 4am. That is why the flight is delayed, but the flight has not been cancelled. 12.15am. I had to ask for water, they gave us 1 small bottle for my friend and I to share. I went to the counter and asked if all passengers could be supplied with water, at 12.45am water for everyone was put on the counter. Keep in mind this is summer and it was really hot. I felt very sorry for the staff having to deal with so many disappointed people. I also think better systems need to be put in place when dealing with such issues. There were no toiletry bags provided, so we couldn’t brush our teeth. The airline knew at 5pm about the delay, and pilots could have been contacted sooner, so we didn’t have to sit in an airport for 8 hours unnecessarily. The alternative was a hotel room and a flight at 7.30pm the next night. Totally inappropriate when you have limited time in the places your visiting. We were there to see my friends relatives. Sadly, this kind of thing happens way too regularly. There must be an ombudsman that deals with this type of issue, and it’s time the public followed it up and held the airlines accountable for the disservice they inflict on unsuspecting passengers. At 2.15am we were given our new boarding passes in a most disorganised fashion. The man called out names, and not everyone knew what was going on, so only half the people were present. They invited us to the boarding gates, but left us standing for around 20minutes not knowing if we were really boarding this time or not. In closing, I would like Vueling to acknowledge the impact this situation has on people, and to pay the compensation they say they will pay. Which they have not done in our case. They keep stringing us along saying we are entitled to compensation, then they said we will receive it by Dec 6th 2018. It’s Dec 13th now and still no compensation.

### "the staff didn't care"
Birmingham to Barcelona. Not a great experience tried to check in online on our return and it put my wife a couple of rows away & we couldn't change it without paying which is an obvious ploy to get more money out of you We asked at check in if we could be moved close together and was told no we would have to pay I explained my wife was scared of flying especially take off but they didn't care, to my annoyance when the doors closed we noticed at least a dozen seats empty all seats of 2, we then had to wait until take off my wife was in tears. Also landing in Barcelona & departing we had to get off & on the plane via a bus which was not great when it was raining and people where held at the door while there boarding passes where checked. I don't think I would ever fly with them again, the staff didn't care.

### "cabin crew were really nice"
Oporto to Barcelona. The flight was a little delayed, not too much. However, the cabin crew were really nice and the seats were very comfortable as well. Looking for to fly with Vueling Airlines again.

### "great experience"
I flew round trip between Copenhagen and Barcelona. My flight to Barcelona was delayed one hour, but boarding was quick once it began. Both flights were very smooth, and I had a great experience. I think checking in online helped, their check in opens 7 days before departure, and if you check in they already assign you a seat.

### "delayed by 6 hours"
Luton to Amsterdam. Flight was delayed by 6 hours, had to buy new tickets as they didn't know when the plane would be arriving at Luton. Had to ring three times to get a refund as the first two were very rude and hung up on me. Awful service.

### "they said nothing was wrong"
19 October 2018, flying from Barcelona to Warsaw with long delay the plane was from other airline Privilege Style without any information. According with International Regulations " In case of specific needs, the Carrier may operate certain flights using aircraft operated by other companies. In such cases, the Carrier will inform passengers as to the identify of the airline operating the flight". When I claim to the customer service Dept in Vueling Airlines they said nothing was wrong and the Company act according with European norms and Regulations. I do not recommend the company for many reasons, as I have been affected and create inconveniences to us.

### "impossible to make a complaint"
A Coruña to London. Oh wow, had heard bad things, but nothing prepared me for when I had a problem - customer services hang up on me twice, and impossible to make a complaint.

### "usual awful service"
Madrid to Manchester via Barcelona. Couldn’t check in online, usual awful service, terrible food / staff, booked with BA and stuck on this ‘operated by’. I hate Vueling and I fly appx 80 times per year, they are the worst.

### "Never fly with them"
Not Verified |  We were due to fly from Florence to Gatwick on Sunday 21st October 2018. On arrival at the airport we were told our flight as delayed by 2 hours. Two hours later our flight was delayed by a further 2 hours. We received a text message saying it was due to a technical fault on the incoming plane. No representative was seen so we did not receive food vouchers. We eventually got on the plane and sat there for an hour when we were told our plane would not be taking off due to wind. We all got off the plane and when we got to the Vueling desk we were handed a sheet of paper that explained the compensation we would receive. 8 hours after to original departure time we were eventually put on a coach to Rome. This was a 3 hour trip which got us there at 3.30 am. We were then told that we would be put on a flight to Gatwick from Rome that evening, our travel companions were sent to Gatwick via Barcelona. We finally arrived home having incurred huge childcare costs and the cost for the day in Rome after a 30 hour delay. On our return we contacted Vueling with the aim to claim the compensation which we had been told we would receive. After 6 emails and numerous phone calls we are still being told we are not due anything because it as air traffic travel, but our text at the time told us different. This company is an absolute disgrace, they abandoned us for hours and now won’t even pay out. Never fly with them.

### "A disappointing experience"
Porto to Barcelona. My husband is not especially tall; average height of around 170 cm. His knees touched the seat in front. How lucky he isn't taller! This travel experience would make us rank Vueling at the bottom of the list. When we arrived at Barcelona the pilot advised we would be disembarking from both the front and rear of the plane. This idea was most appreciated but very short lived. It took at least 15 minutes if not longer for the steps to arrive but pleasingly one bus arrived before the steps. If we could have floated down from the plane to the ground and into the bus I am sure most of the passengers would have been delighted. A disappointing experience all round.

### "Customer Service is disgraceful"
My son flew from Barcelona on the 1 October 2018, with Vueling Airlines to Milan. Upon landing the whole planes luggage had been misplaced. They filled out the apporiate paperwork and were told they should have their bags within 24 hrs. His 2 travel companions received their bags but not my son. I has now been 43 days. Vueling Airlines your Customer Service is disgraceful and after seeing the number of complaints against you, the Airline should lose its accreditation. Words of advice, don’t fly with Vueling Airlines take a bus, train or boat. They would be more reliable than this poor excuse of a Airline Carrier.

### "My flight was cancelled"
Barcelona to Brussels. My flight was cancelled, rescheduled by vueling to the next day. I was told by reps to book a hotel and get a refund online after. I was given 2 taxi vouchers which I was also told to redeem after. Vueling has refused to honor the vouchers or pay for hotel, going against EU regulations. Don't fly this airline.

### "missed my flight to Banjul"
I was meant to travel to Barcelona from  Gatwick on 20th October to connect another Vueling flight to Banjul. The flight to Barcelona was scheduled to depart at 9.10 in the morning to arrive about 12.15 in the afternoon. My flight to Banjul was scheduled to depart at 16.35 from Barcelona. The flight to Barcelona was delayed until 5.30 PM meaning I missed my flight to Banjul. I put a claim in for compensation. Vueling have responded that I'm not entitled to a penny for my flight to Banjul as it was no fault of theirs that the Vueling flight to Barcelona was delayed.

### "still hoping for a refund"
Barcelona to San Sebastian. Our experience was awful. They cancelled a flight with one hours notice, and we tried to reschedule the next day and found out we’d have to fly to a different destination, then take a bus for an hour. No thanks, I was able to book a train for the next day, and I’m still hoping for a refund. The Vueling line to get “another option” was total chaos, with no clear directions or help.Staff were not really rude, just didn’t care and not the least bit sympathetic. Time to make a claim on the travel insurance. Try another airline, rent a car, or take the train.

### "no compensation is due"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight from Nice to Barcelona on Vueling for a weekend holiday. The morning of our flight we got an email that Vueling was canceling our flight due to technical reasons. I attempted to rebook on the next available flight but it was already full. This resulted in a last minute cancellation fee with my hotel in Barcelona and I was told by Vueling that this flight qualified for compensation of $250. I filled out the online compensation form and received a request for my bank account info so they could transfer my compensation directly into it. I provided this info and no $$$. Both of my travel companions received their compensation into their bank accounts but not me. I called Vueling and they said I didn't get mine because I entered a USA bank account and there is a different email form needed for that. They emailed me the form and I submitted it, again no $$$. I submitted it again and received an email from Vueling stating that no compensation is due for my flight. When I call Vueling they say they will transfer my concern to the correct department and will hear back but I never do. If you are an American you have no protection.

### "they have been adequate"
Barcelona to Cardiff. Have flown at least six times with Vueling this year and they have been adequate. Their seats are without doubt not the most comfortable and their time keeping leaves something to be desired (Company motto "If you're half hour late you're early). However they have delivered us to our destination and got us back home within reasonable times so no real complaints The big problem is that they have now abandoned flights from CWL to BCN next year so no further Vueling flights for us which is a great shame. I hope they review the situation for 2020 and reinstate flights from CWL to BCN.

### "horribly uncomfortable"
Gatwick to Florence. This used to be a great flight! Very convenient for commuting to Florence. Alas, all good things must come to pass. The personnel are still courteous and helpful but the seats have been squeezed so insanely close together that it’s not only horribly uncomfortable for any adult but probably also unsafe in case of an emergency evacuation. Only option is to pay more for extra leg room up front. If the seats with extra room are not available, just take another airline. To avoid this torture, connecting via another airport is a price worth paying.

### "disgraceful level of service"
Barcelona to A Coruña. Avoid like the plague. This airline is absolute garbage. I have traveled extensively thru the years and no other airline has ever remotely come close once to the disgraceful level of service Vueling always seems to offer. Delayed and/or cancelled flights are a daily story at Vueling.

### "The worst airline ever"
Seville to Barcelona. The worst airline ever. Flight delayed several times and there was no representative from the airlines to give any information. Pathetic and a waste of time and money. Never every flying with Vueling again.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Split to Madrid via Barcelona. Our bag found missing when we reached Madrid. Completed the claim and been promised once the missing bag is found it will be delivered to the hotel. In the middle of the night airline called the Hotel and left a message for us to go to airport and collect the bag. Contacted customer service in the morning and they promised again to deliver it to the hotel. After waiting till 2pm we took a taxi to Veulings airport office and collected the bag. The person in charge was so rude and tried to put the entire blame on us. Submitted a claim for the taxi - instead of answering to the question, they keep on deflecting with irrelevant responses. Wondering if they are trained this way not to accept their mistakes and not to pay a dime against the claims. Worst customer service ever.

### "My ticket was cancelled"
Munich to Barcelona. My ticket was cancelled, but I was informed about it only 5 minutes before gates closing time. I tried to check in for my flight online, but there was some error, they asked me to contact them by phone. Call center only works from 9am to 9pm, so I wasn't able to get in touch with them. At the check-in counter in the Munich airport staff couldn't find me in their system, but I had the confirmation, I paid for this ticket. Anyway, I was unable to board the plane. Later I received the email from Vueling that my ticket was cancelled because payment didn't go through. But I can see in my bank statement that I paid for this ticket, it wasn't pre-authorization, it was a completed payment. I think the problem was that they sold more ticket on that plane, than there are seats available, because on that day Lufthansa was on strike and Munich airport was very crowded, people needed to leave. On the next day I finally was able to contact their call center, they didn't even apologized for that issue, I'll quote: we issued the refund, money be back in you bank account in 7-10 days, what else do you want from us?

### "crew terrible and immature"
Athens to Barcelona. Worst airline experience of my life. I was going to create a long, detailed review but after reading all others here, I guess I don’t need to - just read down 9 to 10+ reviews and I had multiples of the same issues as already reviewed. Flight delayed 3 times deleting any layover I had for plane changes, crew terrible and immature, flight info translations rare to messy, carry on denied, no help or ownership of their part in the debacle. €250 for hotels, meals, and taxis with no sign of reimbursement offered, not to mention the anxiety and stress. Do not use this airline.

### "staff were not pleasant"
Palma to Barcelona. Space for legs is so small, the person in front of me could not even get her seat back because my knees were too tight. Totally unacceptable. The staff were not pleasant, pretty stiff. Some of the passengers with carry-on luggage had to check their luggage in the belly of the plane at the last minute because of a lack of space. Unacceptable.

### "cannot fault them"
This is the fourth Vueling flight I have taken and once again cannot fault them. Early departure, early arrival, speedy luggage delivery, courteous cabin staff. Noticed that nobody purchased food on board. Very friendly website lets you print your boarding pass as soon as you´ve finished the purchase process, weeks or months ahead of the fllight.

### "missed our flight"
Was on way back to Gatwick from Barcelona went to gate 16 was a huge queue, waited about 20 minutes and there was an announcement that the flight to Gatwick was changed to gate 9! Went gate 9 and waited for nearly half an hour and there was an announcement that flight to Gatwick was moved to gate 8! Went to gate 8 and they told us our flight was moved to gate 6 - went to gate 6 they said our flight was now leaving at gate 16 the gate we started at originally! Went back to gate 16 and missed our flight - speak to Vueling staff was about 10 people waiting as they had missed their flights as well! Vueling staff acted like it wasnt there fault even though our tickets were scanned at each of the gates and not once did anyone tell us it was the wrong gate until we missed the flight ask were we can stay they said they dont know and looked at us with a blank look! Absolutely the worst airline ever do not fly Vueling! !

### "Lack of information"
Mallorca to Gatwick via Barcelona. Delay on the first 40 minutes flight. And on the second flight aircraft change by default in the fuselage of the airplane and new delay of 2 hours. Lack of information and assistance. Bad airline.

### "in the end cancelled"
Booked flight Gatwick to Florence for 29th September 16:10, but it was delayed several times and in the end cancelled. We had to sleep in the  Premier Inn at the airport and were given vouchers and free dinner. On the following day we waited all day before being able to leave. This happened at about 9 pm, but not for Florence! Flight with just 18 passengers (as all the others changed their plans or airline) was for Rome and we were informed we’d be transferred to Florence by coach. After 3 and half hours, we finally arrived by coach to the Peretola airport, on the outskirts of Florence. When I got home it was 5 am! Compensation for all this disruption was denied. This is the first time I used Vueling and it will surely be the last: they should not even be in business!

### "check in found 3 kg more"
Barcelona to Marrakech. I will never use it in the future, because of the unfairness of a staff in the check in at Barcelona Airport. I purchased a total of 56 kg of luggage and had just 3 luggages (two checked luggages + one hand luggage), at the moment of check in she found 3 kg more, told me that i need to pay one more checked luggage for this extra 3 kg and refuse to accept the payment for the only 3 kg. I think that Vueling is so far to be a great company and should hire polite person.

### "Next time I bring my own food"
Amsterdam to Lisbon. The flight was not too bad, it was on time and it was a modern plane and clean. But I never had a crew like this in any of my flights. The plane left Amsterdam late morning and I wanted to eat on the plane. So I was kind of waiting for them to serve food. Even so I was asking if I could get a sandwich, they started only when we were already close to Portugal, our final destination. And instead of serving fast, they were chatting with each other and the stewards were flirting with the stewardesses instead of doing their work. I finally got my sandwich 30 min before landing in a 3hr flight. I am not sure if they ever had a training how to work in service. Next time I bring my own food.

### "online check-in wasn't working"
Munich to Barcelona. Vueling overbooked this flight by 8 people and told us we were being denied boarding because we didn't check in online - though their online checkin website wasn't working! Next, the gate attendant told us we were entitled to 250 euro each as compensation for overbooking and that we would receive it immediately upon landing. Now however the customer service rep is telling us it will take 2-3 weeks - they're lying to us! Vueling has ruined our vacation and I'll never use them again.

### "problem with check in online"
Paris to Milan. I had a major problem with my check in online. I could make do a check in for my friend flying with me but not for myself. The website is not working properly. The check in seems to be confirmed but its not. Coming to the airport I was told I was not registered. It was too late to register at the airport and I had to buy a new ticket with EasyJet (at another airport!) with whom I never had this problem.

### "I would avoid Vueling"
Amsterdam to Valencia. It can be said that the actual flights, to and from Valencia [from Amsterdam] were fine. Checking in at the airports was reasonable too. The whole problem[for us with Vueling is the disastrous website and online check in service. One is encouraged to check in online, particularly if one has luggage for the cargo bay as this is less expensive done online, except the website does not work [for days on end]. The mobile app was a little better, we managed to get the luggage checked in and paid for beforehand, but actual check in was unsuccessful, aside from boarding passes there was no confirmation of check in. Local check in [so we had to get there earlier than needed] was OK the online boarding passes were deemed 'unreliable' so we still ended up with paper... The unreliability of the whole online service is so bad that we will never fly with Vueling again. Unless you have nerves of steel, no cargo luggage, plenty of time to check in at the airfield I would avoid Vueling at all costs.

### "staff miserable and unhelpful"
Not Verified | Rome to Gatwick. Delayed by 30 minutes, no explanation given. On boarding, the cabin crew were talking to each other. No greeting or directing to seat. The staff were miserable and unhelpful. No wine available, despite being on the menu. Would never travel with this airline again.

### "escaped paying me compensation"
Vueling lost my bags between Rome and Ibiza. To their credit they eventually turned up, but my complaint with their process for receiving the compensation I was entitled to. I arrived in Ibiza with the clothes I was wearing: so had to buy a few shirts, underwear and washing kit to see me through the next few days. I was entitled to some 50 euros if the bag wasn't returned within 24 hours, which it wasn't. Back in England I filed the compensation request, providing the various receipts, flight ticket, boarding passes, baggage receipts and bank details all as requested. After a month I received a message from Vueling  requiring me to enter my IBAN details into a web site: The IBAN came directly from my bank. and of course Vueling website just rejected the IBAN provided with the message " The details entered are incorrect": quite how the web site could make that decision is beyond me. And  Vueling have escaped paying me compensation. It doesnt matter who you try to call: their customer help line is hopeless, the contact numbers I have are automated and provide no option to discuss the issue with anyone. So I've given up. Its what they wanted I guess.

### "forgot to put luggage on plane"
Ibiza to Barcelona. We took off 45 minutes late. They forgot to put the luggage on the plane - all the luggage, of all passengers. We waited 2 hours and they told us that we were not sure we would get them in the next 48 hours

### "flight had been cancelled"
Barcelona to Lisbon. Worst airline and customer service ever, after a 5 hour delayed flight they take absolutely no responsibility, though they have to compensate customers for delayed / cancelled flights, they hide behind extraordinary circumstances excuse. We were already on the plane when they announced the flight had been cancelled, because they had no crew available to operate the flight, unprofessional to say the least. Lost many hours complaining to their customer service, and all I get is copy/paste replies, completely ignoring the content of my messages.

### "delayed, no notice"
Barcelona to Bilbao. Terrible, delayed, no notice, just made us wait and wait. Even waiting (seating) at the aero bridge, what a joke! Apparently plane door was jammed, we boarded halfway then asked us to leave, absolutely hopeless!

### "both extensively delayed"
The flights to and from London were both extensively delayed and Vueling failed to give adequate notice and constantly failed to provide accurate updates. I was delayed 6 hours out of Gatwick and on the return flight the online info and the App info gave no indication of a delay. At check in at Barcelona I was told a ten minute delay which turned out to be 2 hours. Total incompetence and unwillingness to provide adequate customer service.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Worst customer service ever. My flight was delayed due to bad weather conditions, even though other airlines would take off (read: Vueling pays the minimum for landing/departure fees, so it has the least priority in case of air traffic restrictions). Then, in the end, our flight got cancelled because the hold would not work - clearly a technical failure. After a lot of confusion, they offered a replacement flight 3 day later (a joke! ), and refused to compensate the EU legislation determined amount of 250 euros, claiming we were experiencing (only) "extreme meteorological events". They ignored my message for a long time, replied once and then switched to an automated reply. Try to avoid this company at all costs, they are constantly late and do not care about their customers!

### "absolute worst customer service"
Palma to San Sebastian via Barcelona. After having a flight that was delayed for almost 2 hours due to missing flight crew, our flight was then rerouted to an alternate destination within about an hours drive of our original destination due to "low clouds". Upon arriving the the alternate destination, I was without luggage. I filed a claim at the airport and took a taxi to the original flight destination for an additional cost of approximately 100 Euros. I arrived to clear skies and no sight of "low clouds". Over 24 hours later, my luggage was located and delivered to my hotel. After filing a luggage claim reimbursement online, several weeks later I was instructed to submit all supporting documentation and send it through the postal service via certified mail. I did so at a cost of $16.65. Another several weeks later, my claim was denied because Vueling stated my baggage was delivered within 24 hours. It was not. So, I added international calling to my mobile plan, in order to call customer service in Spain from the US. This just cost me another $5.00, only to be told by "Luggage Incidents" that my baggage was delivered within 24 hours, but they cannot tell me what time it was actually delivered. I asked to speak with a manager and was denied. The is the absolute worst customer service I have ever received from an airline, and I will not fly Vueling ever again. A train would have been a better option and we would have arrived at our intended destination quicker and with my luggage in hand.

### "Worst airline ever flown"
Amsterdam to Barcelona. Worst airline ever flown with. The fact that you have to pay extra for a seat next to your family member says enough. Also the long distances towards the gate from Amsterdam is terrible.

### "Horrible experience with Vueling"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to San Sebastián in economy. Horrible experience with Vueling. Cancelled our flight. We were already on the plane when they announced we had to go back to the terminal. The airport buses took us to the exit doors. No information whatsoever of the reasons. Nobody appeared to give any explanation or apology. After 4 hours of protests some of us were put on a flight to Bilbao. A disgrace of a company. Never again.

### "Not worth the bargain"
Not worth the bargain! The plane is like a typical budget airline. Light seats that don't recline. The lack of entertainment options didn't bug me as it was a short flight. But, they made me check my carry on baggage and then lost it. (Along with at least 3 others on this flight). They found and delivered my luggage 48 hours later. But I have put a claim in for incurred expenses as a result of the delay, and they have approved it, but after two weeks, still have not made the payment.

### "angry and disappointed"
Venice to Paris. Vueling told us that the flight is cancelled due to bad weather, however, I am wondering how is it possible that only our flight was cancelled in the entire airport that night (31 August 2018)? The rescheduling of this flight was two days after (2 September 2018 night), which will cause me and my sister missing the international flight from Paris to Hong Kong (CX278). Right after knowing the flight from Venice to Paris is cancelled, I talked to Vueling staff about the rescheduling, they said they could not help me to change the tickets, but I can call the Vueling customer service (which she claimed that it is a 24 hours hotline, but in fact it is not). She suggested me to change to the earlier flight at around 9am the other morning (1 September 2018) which will go from Venice to Barcelona and from Barcelona to Paris. Despite the hotel was assigned to us at 2:30am and the bus arrived at 3:30am, we still tried our very best and managed to get back to the airport to try to catch that flight at 6am. Unfortunately, when we reached the airport, Vueling said it is impossible to change the flight from one journey to two journeys and asked us to go to the ticket counter. Ticket counter then said Vueling have the authority and they could not help. We were then being kicked backward and forward without any help. We were very angry and disappointed about the service provided by Vueling. The staff was unhelpful and rude that morning (1 September 2018). We eventually have no way to go to Paris in time , cause the ticket office said all the flight from all airlines were fully booked. We therefore have to book the flight ticket from Venice to Hong Kong directly. We have lost a lot of money because of Vueling's odd decision to cancel the flight which other airlines didnt encounter that night. We lost our hotel fee in Paris, our missed international flights to Hong Kong, also, Vueling took us to a really far hotel situated in Bolognese and had not included any transportation back to the airport (so may I know what is the claim that you will include the transport between hotel and airport if it's only one-way). it costed us 60 EURO to come out from the hotel to the airport that morning to catch the flight that Vueling staff suggested, which, not to mention, it became an 'impossible' change the other morning.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to Nice. Worst airline ever. It was my first time purchasing from them and I regret why I didn't check other reviews before purchasing a ticket. Our flight was canceled due to so called "operational reasons" and we were informed when we reached the airport. Their rude personnel at Barcelona airport told us we can either claim a refund or take the bus to Nice which was an 8 hour long journey. I have requested for a claim and have sent them my credit card details, but there has been nothing so far. It's almost a month now, and we have returned from our vacation. Super disappointed.

### "complete lack of service"
Paris Orly to Rome. If I could give a -10 I would. I’ve never experienced an on time flight with them. They do not update flight status so even when the flight is an hour late (that’s standard) it will still say “on time”. It’s the complete lack of service that makes me avoid this airline in the future at all cost.

### "Worst company encountered"
Barcelona to Rome. Worst company encountered in 30 years of flying. They cancelled my flight, pushed me around for over a month telling me that I was going to get 250 euros compensation, they asked for my bank account info to transfer the money, and after multiple exchange of e mail and phone calls, where they were kept on telling me that it was a matter of days that I would get my compensation. I received and e mail without a signature (probably they think their clients don't even deserve to know who are they dealing with) saying that my case was reviewed and I don't qualify for a refund, even if the flight was cancelled by them without any apparent reason. They didn't have the decency to tell me in the previous phone calls that I was not getting it.

### "checked-in items not on site"
Barcelona to Rome, my flight was cancelled at the very last minute with no explanation. They booked us on a later flight around 6.30pm. We were given a last minute gate. The plane was 15-20 minutes late due to the other flight. When we landed in Rome at around 10ish pm, the nightmare started. My 2 checked-in items were not on site. I have to fill out a lost/delayed items to open the case. I contacted Vueling many times to ensure that my items were return. Instructions were given to send my items to my hotel in Milan. On my departure, one of my two items arrived to my Rome hotel. I'm not quite sure how many times I have contacted Vueling airlines on the delivery of my other luggage but each call was either, no update or the Rome Airport is holding my luggage. This went on for my entire trip to Europe. I went back home to San Francisco on Aug 13th with 1 missing luggage. I had to contact AMEX Global Assist (which they were very amazing and reliable Amex Service) to locate and get a daily update of my other luggage. It took almost 15 days or so to have my luggage sent to my address back home. The worst part is that I booked an "excellent" seat that costs 3x than the regular seat. So my seat is not cheap. Yet, Vueling Airline mismanaged to prioritize my checked-in items. I've never experience such stupidity in luggage management system especially for anyone who is booking First or Business class seat. I may be lucky to get my other bag back but I feel really bad for others who have the same experience with missing/delayed items.

### "disgusting customer service"
Nice to Split via Barcelona. Vueling canceled my flight, after waiting in the airport for 7 hours due to delay. I have been attempting to receive a refund for 3 months for the services which were not provided. Absolutely disgusting customer service.

### "no announcement of my name"
Rome to Corfu. Vueling changed gate at the last minute and no English was spoken nor was the gate changed on the board. After being 8 hours of waiting I was told that the gate was changed, there was no announcement of my name and the staff just walked away. The flight still had 20 minutes before schedule. I had to buy 2 tickets via Athens and also missed my shuttle service. This flight was at 0045 and the wait for the Athens flight gave me 11 hours waiting and a further 4 hours wait for the 2nd flight to Corfu. The cost was quadruple of the original flight.

### "Nobody knows what is going on"
I suggest you avoid this airline at all cost. When we arrived at the airport, there were two rows for check in that were open. The clerk in our row suddenly disappeared and left everyone in line standing there for 30 minutes. Very unprofessional. Also, our flight which was supposed to leave in 5 minutes was not displayed yet on the gate monitor and not mentioned as delayed on any of the screens. Nobody knows what is going on since there are no staff here. Flew with them before and they are always delayed. To top things of, my husband and I are not seated together. Never again Vueling, TuiFly or Transavia are much better budget airlines and more reliable.

### "Avoid this company at all cost"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Fuerteventura to Brussels via Barcelona. 5 hours delayed in Fuerteventura, connection missed in Barcelona. Had to sleep there then got another flight for Brussels the next morning. Of course they lost our luggages in the process. Avoid this company at all cost.

### "Staff were really unfriendly"
Flew Fuerteventura to Amsterdam. Unable to compete with other low-budget airlines. Check-in system is horrible, you are forced to buy your seats. At the airport all passengers needed to go to the counter so imense qeues rounded up. Staff were really unfriendly during the flight and only do their selling round. I will never fly again with Vueling Airlines and recommend for example Transavia as an alternative.

### "never said a word to anyone"
I and my girlfriend flew out to Barcelona from Birmingham on 24th August. When we arrived at the airport we saw that our outbound flight was delayed 1 hour which is a pain been a late afternoon flight but not too much of a problem. This then turned into 1.5 hours without anyone telling us of further disruption and no Vueling Customer Service or representatives in sight. Returning to Birmingham our transfer was on time and got us on time to terminal 2 at Barcelona airport. When in the terminal we couldn’t find our flight on the board and yet again no Vueling staff around to inform us of anything. We eventually found a tiny kiosk with one man in and a scrappy bit of paper stuck to the glass saying all Vueling flights are from terminal 1 today which was 30 minutes away by the time shuttle bus arrived. Again not too bad we still had time for something to eat and got to the gate on time. When at the gate on time with all the passengers waiting there nothing was moving. 20 minutes passed and the staff just didn’t say anything and were looking out the window. I asked what’s going on, they never had a clue what was going on or when the plane was actually getting there and never said a word to anyone. Finally we got on the plane 45 minutes late and after 1 and half hours standing round I was thirsty and no one knew whether to walk back up to shops in case the plane that was at gate was actually our plane and could be boarding any moment and it was a good walk back to the nearest shop in departures. So shortly after take off I asked a female cabin crew member if she could get me a drink I had the right change €2.60 for a can of orange and got told no. I can only get a drink when everyone else is getting served. An hour later after a bit of turbulence they finally started serving. They got to a row in front and stopped so i asked politely “excuse me can I get that drink ?  I got told no again! I had to wait for the other cart from the other end. That cart arrived, got to my row then without even looking at us started walking back - other passengers had to stop them to point them to me I was astonished. They blocked both ends with trolleys so no one could go the toilet. My girlfriend and other women then went to the front of the plane when the cart was close to been out the way of access to the toilet only to be stopped again and again but the stewardesses and told to wait. They then drew the curtain and told the waiting passengers they need room to work they can’t pass for the toilet yet. After waiting the stewardess pulled the curtain back and walked backwards with the trolley into my girlfriend and told her to use the other toilet at the other end of the plane which was also blocked by a trolley.

### "Horrible experience"
Barcelona to Gatwick. Horrible experience on multiple fronts. We tried to check in online the day before and check in wasn’t working. We tried to self check in at the airport and that wasn’t working. We waited in line only to find that we had no seats. Our flight was overbooked and 15 people were bumped to the next flight - 6 hours later. We were given conflicting information from 3 different customer service representatives related to getting our refund and where to get tickets for the next flight. even more infuriating - the staff were not even apologetic. Horrible experience for many reasons will not fly again.

### "book your flight on a different airline"
Never fly Vueling! My family of 6 was on a wonderful European vacation. Our flight from Venice to Paris was cancelled. We missed a day in Paris. We lost a couple thousand dollars in hotel rooms, rebooked flights at last minute and missed tours. Not to mention the memories of visiting Paris. Getting compensation for cancellation was even more frustrating. Stalling, redundant requests, technology that doesn't work, bad service. 3 months later and I still haven't received compensation. Do yourself a favor and book your flight on a different airline.

### "avoid this airline"
Milan to Amsterdam. I have flown with Vueling several times, and regularly book their services for other passengers through my work. Although most of the flights I have personally taken have eventually arrived at their destination and staff have been reasonably friendly, that is about as much as I can say in their favour. The administration and customer service apparatus seems fundamentally broken - receiving an invoice for a flight, theoretically possible through an online form, in reality requires at least 2-3 follow up phone calls (with a significant phone tree and wait times). Other automated emails do not seem to work either, and basic financial services (e.g. issuing confirmation of the outcome of a payment that timed out due to an error in their system; or confirming additional services added by phone to a booking) are apparently unavailable. While flights do occasionally arrive on time, a one hour delay seems average on European flights. Colleagues have experienced "delays" of over 24 hours (not associated with any extreme weather, strikes. or any circumstance that impacted other airlines flying the same route). If you need to be sure of reaching your destination at the stated time, and most especially if you have any kind of financial administration requirements, avoid this airline.

### "rude and un-polite staff"
Amsterdam to Barcelona. Terrible customer service. I had already done check in before arriving at the airport. There were two flights from Amsterdam to Barcelona departing at exactly the same time (10:20 am). I approached the Vueling counter so that they could reconfirm the gate for Vueling’s flight. The guy said: “That’s what screens are for”. I explained I wanted to be sure about my gate since there were two flights for the same destination and at the same time appearing on the screen. He replied: “That’s what the screen is for. You should find it for yourself”. Absolutely rude and un-polite staff!

### "worst airline we have flown"
Gatwick to Paris CDG. The worst airline we have ever flown with after canceling not one but two flights consecutively from Gatwick to Paris, leaving us stranded for two days! Both 21:10 flights were canceled, there was no-one from Vueling at at the airport or by telephone to rebook customers. They knew the flight would be canceled as we could not land at 2am in Paris but did not tell passengers until 11.30pm. The following day, we were rebooked onto the same flight which was also canceled! We were told that they could put us on the same flight the next day at 21.10 (the same one that had been canceled two days in a row) or rerouted via Barcelona, which would take us 11 hours instead of 40-minutes! Another Vueling rep told us over the phone 'I cannot help you'. I don't know how this company doesn't go bankrupt with their lack of care for passengers and constant cancelations. There is also no-one from Vueling at at the airport or by phone after 9pm. Avoid at all costs unless you want to be stuck at the airport! !

### "great value for money"
Not Verified |  London to Algiers via Barcelona. Having arrived 2 hours before our scheduled departure, we hoped to be able to take our time and perhaps visit Duty Free. Alas, that was not the case. The check-in desks served all of Vuelings' flights that morning, and with only 2 agents on duty, the queues were dreadfully long. Once we were checked in, we had to run through the airport and straight to the gate, only to find there was a delay! The plane to BCN was very full and the seats were extremely cramped, with very little legroom. From BCN to ALG, the flight was certainly less full, and the seat felt somewhat more comfortable, though the legroom was still far from amazing. The Buy on Board service was unsatisfactory with very little to choose from. The service at all times was good. Whilst this review doesn't paint the most positive image of the airline, I would recommend it because it has great value for money, and stands out as one of the better LCCs.

### "first and last time"
Manchester to Barcelona. First and last time we will be using Vueling airline. We were due 2:25pm. I recieved my first email at 6:02am that morning advising me that the flight was already delayed. There was no check in online available so we checked in the old fashioned way, in the airport where they printed off our tickets. They also took our cabin luggage off us. Our flight was delayed by 1 hour and 45 minutes. When we finally reached our destination (Barcelona) that’s where the struggle really began, it took 1 full hour to retrieve our luggage from the carrousel! Then to meet the reps to assist us with our transfer bus, them poor girls had no idea what they were doing, due to delayed flights and the faffing about with the luggage, they were so confused! It took a further hour for the girls to allocate the crowd to the transfer coaches. I am aware that the struggle in Barcelona airport can not be a direct complaint to Vueling airlines however if it wasn’t for their delayed flight and insisting they take out luggage off us, maybe we could have been at our hotel 4 hours earlier, as planned!

### "don’t book on a low budget airline"
Gatwick to Barcelona. No online check in - time to introduce online check in if you want to be a big player. Queued for over 2 hours to check in which took less then 2 mins as we had hand luggage. Didn’t open up more check in desks when there were 2 problematic parties causing the delay. And then blamed it on late arrivals -  sort your check in process out first. Rude staff. We were told we were late and there was no room in the overhead lockers -  when we got on the plane we had queue with other passengers who must have also been late and the over head lockers were empty! About to take off then we didn’t because now there is a fault with the plane. Let’s hope my bag is there when I arrive. To summarise, don’t book on a low budget airline, there is a reason.

### "blamed for arriving late"
Barcelona to Gatwick. Very rude staff at the checkin counter. Horrible service. We received two emails that the flight was delayed for 2 hours and we therefore arrived at the airport later than we originally planned. At the checkin, we were blamed for arriving late, and were refused to check in our luggage. Did not waste time to argue. Never using again.

### "terrible service"
Luton to Amsterdam. Terrible airline, even more terrible service. Flight got delayed by 3 hours. Tried to reach Vueling for some questions I need an answer to and found out there was no one to actually help me. Through the app I could chat with a chatbot, which would just direct me to the website’s FAQ page. Then calling their “Customer service” number wasn’t of any help because that was a bot too: not able to help me with my problem. Also I wasn’t even able to send them a Facebook message or review them there. So after my failed search for a Vueling staff member at the airport itself I gave up and just waited. Three hours after we were supposed to depart they announced two things: one being that you could get a 5 pound coupon for a drink and the other thing being that you should move to the gate. You see, getting a drink with a coupon whilst moving to the gate is not very much possible.

### "never recommend this company"
Barcelona to Amsterdam. I have flown with Vueling about 10 times over the past 2 years and I cannot recall any time in which the aircraft departed at the right time. Being waiting for about an extra hour is commonplace with them. However this last time, heading to Amsterdam Schiphol from Barcelona, they boarded all the passengers and informed us that the plane would not take off until they solved some problems that had something to do with traffic(1 extra hour on top of their already expected 1h delay) . No other flights were delayed in the same terminal but those operated by Vueling. I have decided to refrain from flying with them anymore. On the other hand, I must say that their staff have been always very polite to me and the rest of the passengers sitting near me. Overall, I would never recommend this company to anyone that I like.

### "this worthless airline"
Keflavik to Seville via Barcelona. My flight was cancelled with absolutely no warning five hours before boarding. I learned of it via text, and there were no airline staff at the airport to help explain. When I called, the woman on the phone didn’t even know it was cancelled, and couldn’t provide any information on when the next flight would be. Spent 800 euros getting another flight so I didn’t have to stay in Reykjavik overnight (which Vueling did not offer to pay for). I will never be flying this worthless airline.

### "our flight was cancelled"
San Sebastion to Barcelona. Myself and a friend had booked a flight from San Sebastian to Barcelona in July 2018 under the same booking. We arrived to the airport for a 8am flight to discover our flight was cancelled. There was no announcement and very little communication and direction to what was happening. We lined up at the check in counter with the passengers of two other flights that were cancelled. Upon speaking to the man and women at the desk they advised a bus was being arranged which would be there within 1 hour and it would take 6-8 hours to get to Barcelona. OR we would nominate to take the next flight at approx 6pm that evening however they could not confirm or deny if that flight too would be cancelled. We needed to get to Barcelona so we opted to take the bus. The bus eventually arrived, was tight, small, no leg room, no seat pocket, no space! We then lodged a refund request and was told it was going through. My friend has booked the flights under her name, email address, credit card etc so she requested the refund. Days later she was notified her request was approved and to expect the amount in her account. She received the money. She emailed them to advise there were two passengers on the booking etc. One month later I am still yet to receive my refund and Vueling has stopped responding to me. In response to your request, we would like to indicate that we checked that the second passenger finally took the flight, so the refund in this case is not possible. I did not take another flight with their airline. They have no supporting documents or proof yet "Following our resolution to your case in our previous e-mail, we proceeded to revise this case and have verified that our company has complied at all times with our Conditions of Carriage and the current European air travel regulation. They haven't complied at ALL. The fact they can refund one passenger and not the other when the circumstances are identical is pathetic.

### "We showed up fairly late"
Amsterdam to Milan. I did not manage to fly with them. We were near the gate at a bar since there was no sign of boarding on the monitor. We showed up fairly late to board since it looked Delayed. When we arrived at the desk two ladies show no sign of of interest in our situation, told us that they are not required to call out our names if someone is late and walked away. I realise it is our fault (even though i believe most passengers rely on the monitors to check the status of the flight) but seeing no empathy or our situation, the fact that they didnt call us or give last calling for boarding and the fact they walked away is enough to rate this company.

### "the very worst airline"
Valencia to Palma de Mallorca. Yet again Vueling Airlines have excelled themselves. Last evening the flight was due to depart at 23.00. In the end it departed at 01.50 ! What was really annoying is that they displayed a message at the gate that further information would be forthcoming in 60 minutes - this was on screen for more than 2 hours. At the same time i had received both emails and text messages giving me totally different information. One of the emails had a click here for more info button - this gave me a departure time of 01.40 - which turned out to be correct. This information was available before 23.00 so why was this not communicated to everyone then? Even the gate staff (when they finally arrived at 24.00) didn't know this. All they were telling people is that it was likely to be 2 or 3 hours late. A total shambles. What I want to know is how do they keep their operating license? It is such a shoddy amateurish airline - why are the top management not fired for  gross incompetence? By comparison Ryan Air and Easy Jet are perfect. I have flown with many airlines and Vueling are by far the very worst airline I have ever encountered. Why does IAG tolerate such poor performance ?

### "avoid this company"
Copenhagen to Paris. Worst company ever. Flights never on time. And why explain the safety rules in Spanish when the flight in going from Denmark to Paris. The company owe me 200€ because the flight was overbooked and i didn't get any seat. But they used the same code for the new plane booking so I cannot prove I couldn't get the previous flight, is it even legal to do that? So my advice, if you can avoid this company, do it.

### "service recovery was poor"
Barcelona to Brussels. Cancelled flight. Zero information given. Ground staff in Barcelona shockingly unprepared or informed. The service recovery was poor. The staff had no clue what to do. I was embarrassed for them. Someone with info to start re-booking process did arrive but damage done. Do not trust this airline. Cancellations and delays can happen but it is how companies deal with the situation that people remember. Information, information, presence of staff who know what to do!

### "impossible to talk to anyone"
Paris to Gatwick. Lost luggage. It arrived the day after but it only got delivered after 48 hours. Brand new luggage delivered seriously damaged. Impossible to get a claim form on-line. Emailed the company’s customer service and supposedly lost luggage but got nowhere. Called them and impossible to talk to anyone.

### "Disgusting customer service"
Not Verified |  I had paid for a flight with Vueling for the 17/07 flying from Cardiff to Barcelona. Downloaded their app for their "latest updates". Got to the airport that day only to be told that the flight had been cancelled and we would need to wait to see when we could rebook. After about two hours, we were informed that our flight was automatically rebooked for the 20/07 but in Gatwick airport. We could take this rebooked flight or request a refund. I requested a refund and was told by one of the employees that it would be with me in 5-7 days. A week and a half later I still had not received my refund so I rung again - only to be told that my refund was in transition and could take 2 weeks to be deposited into my account. After two weeks I rang only to be told this time, that I would not be getting a refund for my flight. They could not provide a reason for this and could also not provide a reason as to why I had been told by two different employees that I could have a refund. Disgusting customer service.

### "we could not board"
Barcelona to Gatwick. Our flight got delayed approximately 5 hours. When the plane arrived (almost 6pm), they had sold more tickets than there were seats, and we could not board. No one told us anything for the 5 hours we were waiting for the plane to arrive. If we would have known there were not enough seats, I would have looked for another option. but they didn't and they left around 30 passengers without boarding. They gave us a boarding pass for the next available plane which was delayed 3 HOURS. We ended up arriving in London at around 11:30PM, I was supposed to catch a plane at 5:00pm to Boston  which I obviously lost. Vueling didnt offer to pay anything. Not only that- but since we couldn't board our plane due to overbooking, the EU law states that the airline has to pay 250Euros. Three weeks after the incident, I have not received this. They have sent me emails in Spanish, English, and in French (I dont speak french). I reply to the emails and they send me the same email in another language.

### "Customer service sucks"
Amsterdam to Barcelona. Boarded too early, sitting around for 45 minutes. Took off, attendants hid behind screen for 45 minutes, young daughter really needed toilet and seat belt signs left on for way too long. Surly staff who seem to find having customers an inconvenience. Still kept hiding behind screen once toilets were open. Baggage took best part of hour to arrive on belt for no apparent reason. Customer service sucks, avoid.

### "don't expect the employees to care"
I flew Vueling from Barcelona to London-Heathrow, a flight that should have been simple enough. Upon arrival at the airport, we received notification that the flight was delayed by close to 2 hours. We settled in for a meal, and as we were eating, began to get notifications about an earlier boarding time, so we started to board the plane almost minimizing the original delay. However, it is here that things took a turn for the worse. Upon scanning passes and going into the air bridge, we were stopped. We held for 15-20 minutes before finally someone showed up to tell us that there was no crew for the flight. The worst part is that we could not go back the way we came because of security procedures regarding exit-Schengen flights. So we proceeded to wait another 15 minutes in the hot/glass air bridge with no AC. When we asked for water, we were refused and the airline employee looked shocked that we even asked. In the end, we left with the original 2-hour delay. When contacting the airline for sympathy compensation for the gross mistreatment, they continue to deny me and claim that it doesn't fall under EC 261. They're right, except I never requested EC 261. I asked for compensation for the mistreatment, which they continue to hide from. The customer service deserves no stars, because they are either not reading, or they are not willing to compensate flyers and they choose to hide it by saying other things that don't relate to you in order to tire you out and make you stop trying. It's a cheap airline, don't expect the employees to care about their job!

### "Zero response from Vueling"
Gatwick to Florence. Lost luggage in Overhead compartment. So far I have sent 5 x email and made 6 Calls, visited lost/found at Florence Airport and called to Barcelona. Zero response from Vueling. Someone has to take this airline to task their customer service is nowhere to be found.

### "the way back got cancelled"
First flight from Barcelona to Ibiza had a technical issue  so after 15 min of flight, we went back to Barcelona, waiting 3 hours without information for the new one. And now the way back got cancelled!

### "staff don’t have basic information"
If there was a rate less than a star, that would be perfect for this airline. Our flight got postponed for two hours, but later got an email that it expanded to a day. Flight delays are completely normal, but what is not normal is the fact that staff don’t have basic information of the flight and the lack of customer service and understanding! After the flight was cancelled we stayed for almost 6 hours in the airport arguing with the staff. Very low and unpleasant experience. Never flying with Vueling Airlines again!

### "incompetence with wings"
Gatwick to Barcelona, Vueling is not an airline, it is incompetence with wings. 2 hours in a queue to check in, online check in was broken and forced me to pay for premium, no bag drop, flight was 3 hours delayed, sat in plane for over an hour because they hadn’t yet loaded the plane with the bags yet, so 4 hours delayed, they over booked the flight by 10 people so they waited 4 hours to not even end up on the plane! Staff couldn’t care less. Never fly vueling.

### "we are still waiting"
Barcelona to Menorca. Vueling is a disgrace for traveling. It is highly disfunctional and there is no low cost. We spent Saturday on a beautiful summer day at the airport in Barcelona for a 40 minute flight to Menorca that was supposed to leave at noon and so far at 8.30 pm we still don't know if we are taking off. BTW the round trip fare was above 200 dollars. The staff know nothing, and the kept dragging the issue all day so here we are still waiting.

### "Worst service ever"
Not Verified |  Worst service ever from Vueling Airlines. After making us wait 2 hours on a delay they finally cancelled our flight from Paris to Venice. Then told us that the next flight we would be on was 3 days later and would take 18 hours to get to Venice. Didnt put us up in a hotel even though it was 11pm by the time we sorted everything out.

### "like something out of a terrible movie"
Barcelona to Geneva. If I could give Vueling negative 1000 stars I would. It's the worst airline I have ever flown in over 30 years of traveling. They stole two days of our vacation with their delays, lies, and non-communication. Our first flight was CDG to BCN - it left 8 hours late! But during those 8 hours, they just kept sending us text alerts that it would leave in an hour or two, and there were no staff in the airport to provide any information, literally no one. The passengers were so confused and tired and together we found a third-party flight tracker app that showed our plane sitting in London for some reason. After many hours and thinking it would be cancelled, a Vueling person showed up about 7pm and said "oh we found a plane for you". We missed watching the World Cup final as well as a whole day of our holiday, it was sad and beyond frustrating. Then, a week later, we were set to fly Vueling again from BCN to Geneva. Well, surprise, this flight was four hours late. And the same story. No one at the gate, no one anywhere from Vueling to provide information. At first we thought we'd depart on time, but no, of course not, we just kept getting updates that it would leave in one hour, then two, then departing immediately, no, that's wrong, in three hours etc. Apparently, our plane had 'technical problems" but then two more planes were found and those also had "technical problems". We only found out this information by Googling and asking fellow passengers, because no one from Vueling could be found. At one point, our boarding passes were scanned and we were put on a bus, only to sit stranded on the bus for 30 minutes with no explanation and finally we all just go off and went back up to the airport, where they said "we have no information" if asked whether our flight would ever depart. One girl was working behind the desk at this point, but she started crying and saying "it's like this every day, you don't understand, every single day" as the passengers swarmed her asking for updates. (Apparently, the same flight the day before had been cancelled after passengers waited 12 hours in the airport until 2:30am, were sent to a far-flung hotel at 4am and back to the airport at 8am to again undergo the same awful treatment.) For an hour the phone rang and rang at our departure gate desk, but no one from Vueling was there, so a passenger picked it up and said "this is one of your passengers, there is no one from you staff to answer, and we need information about our flight", but no response, of course. After this happened, I almost laughed at how bad it was, like something out of a terrible movie, but I also felt keep like crying as they wasted two days of my holiday and caused so much stress. I've put in claims for the four flights to get 4X250 euro compensation owed under EU law, but of course they aren't responding to those requests and there is no number to call; they just say "submit all claims through the website". Never again.

### "was the worst trip"
London to La Coruña. Recently a group of friends and I booked a trip with their co shared airline or British Airways which is vueling. This was the worst trip I have ever been on. Sitting waiting for the gate number to appear, the flight was cancelled - no announcement made. Following this the proceeded to make us wait 3 hours to tell us whether our flight was cancelled and what was going to happen next. They then said they are unable to book us on another flight we had to wait until the morning to phone this number. Stranded at the airport to phone a number that doesn’t open for another 9 hours is completely unacceptable. Then to phone that number and be told we needed to go to the airport desk is beyond belief. After 3 hours on the phone and establishing, they will not book us on another flight within the next 3 days, they are also unable to change our departure or arrivals airport so we can fly somewhere close to our destination. Not only did we have to buy new indirect 12 hour flights for what should have been 2 hours it was at escalated rates. Fine we got there much to our disbelief and confirmed that we had our seat back. Only to arrive past the first security check (of passport and boarding passes) to find one of our party had been taken off the plane. Even though there were 8 seats left on this plane she was unable to board (with her boarding pass, the same one that had been approved by the first checks) and she was yet again stranded at the airport. In summary do not book with this airline if you don’t want to: Get a cancelled flight whilst waiting for the gate number - with no explanation. Stranded at the airport and told to phone a number in the morning. The most unhelpful airline - unable to get you to your destination by modifying the departure or destination airport. Stranded on your way home at the gate with a half empty plane after being told your boarding pass and checks were adequate.

### "They wasted 2 days"
Split to Rome. Flight was initially delayed one hour, then we were allowed to board. We were asked to wait roughly 3 hours on board. We were then asked to disembark because a problem was found with the wheels of the plane. So far so good, on occasion airplanes break and passenger safety ought to be priority number 1. However, they then made us wait another 4 hours at the gate with no information about whether they were gonna fix the airplane, and no Vueling representative to tell us what to do. At 12 am we were told our flight was canceled and that we’d be provided an accommodation for the night. It’s now the day after and the plane has been yet again delayed. They wasted 2 days of my life for a 45 minute flight.

### "never use Vueling again"
Birmingham to Barcelona. We are supposed to check-in online within 48 hours of departure. When I tried, the website wouldn't recognise our booking number. So we phoned customer services, and after 45 minutes, spoke to a man who advised that our booking number didn't exist, and that we should rebook and pay again, if we wanted to be on our flight on Wednesday. We will never use Vueling again!

### "very nice staff"
Barcelona to Jerez. Aircraft condition was good, very nice staff, a little delay of 5 minutes, cheap, good food. The flight was very soft, no turbulence and we don’t butter the bread at the landing.

### "Flight was delayed 2hrs"
Ibiza to Barcelona. Flight was delayed 2hrs and my luggage was put on the wrong carousel so that took me an hour to find, as a result I missed my other flight to Colombia costing me an extra $1500! No compensation, no anything because my other flight was not booked with them. Never again!

### "no help or instructions"
Very disappointing and dishonest airline. They don’t care about customers. I tried it first for the time and last time in July 2018 and I won’t recommend it to anyone. My flight was from Nantes (France) to Belgium thru Barcelona and we made it to Barcelona fine and then our flight got cancelled and Vueling staff kept us waiting without telling us the reason behind the flight cancellation, they didn’t tell us what was next or which flight they would book us with. Their staff don’t speak other languages besides Spanish. With their poor way of communication, they lied to us and told us to go grab our luggage (unbelievable) even though we had lots of elderly people who can’t even walk. We went out to get our luggage per their staff and waited 2 hours and no luggage found. Had to come back to their customer service area and complained and we were told our plane is ready and we must go thru security again. They were lying and there was no plane, they were trying to calm us down and fooling us. We came back again, and they had to book us with a late flight. They made us go back and forth thru security checking couple times with no help or instructions from Vueling staff. I made it to Brussels, but my luggage got lost between in transit between Barcelona and Brussels. If you appreciate time and want to spend good time traveling look for different airlines and don’t let cost fool you, they will ruin all your plans.

### "second time delayed!"
Lisbon to Amsterdam. Second time flying Vueling and second time delayed! This time by 4 hours, 5 if you consider the time difference. 9 months of bad reviews of this airline with delays and no change in service, what a disgrace! Get your act together, this is unprofessional.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to Brussels. Worst customer service / information. Flight delayed with no information whatsoever and screens were not even updated. Made all the passengers wonder whether the flight would be cancelled like 2 days prior to our flight. Company to avoid even if it means longer trips.

### "Our flight was cancelled"
I have never experienced an airline quite like this. Our flight was cancelled (okay that’s the first tick) and then the guy at the check in counter booked in our bags for the flight later in the day, and gave us tickets for the wrong  date (the following day). So we spent 2 hours trying to stop our bags from boarding the plane. The staff said the bags were already on the plane on the way to Amsterdam. So we went to the hotel they organized for us, and the next day they told us our bags are still here, and will be sent with the earliest flight. We went for reimbursement for the taxi, but the desk closed just as we reached the front. Then, to put the cherry on top of the cake web didn’t get, our flight was delayed by 2 hours due to technical problems of landing equipment. It’s safe to say that I will never take this airline again (was told afterwards that it happened to 2 of my friends on other veuling flights).

### "I had the worst experience"
Not Verified |  I had the worst experience with this airline. I was flying from Amsterdam to Rome at 7am to arrive at 9:20am. Over the course of the next 12 hours we were told that the plane had mechanical issues and we'd be leaving in 30 minutes. They continues to tell us that had no further details for 2 hours, when they sent us to transfer desk that had no personnel working at it. We we given lunch vouchers and told that they had no details on our flight and that we should just check the status online and on the boards in the airport. Over the course of the next few hours the departure board in the airport and Vueling's status showed wildly conflicting departure times. We were sent to three different gates with promises that our aircraft would be there and we'd be departing shortly. At one point we were shown our aircraft several gates over and that we'd be getting shuttled over to it, with the staff shuttled there first. We never received word from the staff that the aircraft was flight ready and thus never were shuttled to the aircraft. The situation escalated with very angry passengers resulting in the gate attendant, whom we'd been speaking with throughout this situation, breaking down into tears and leaving as he was stressed and over his shift by several hours. (This gate attendant was not an employee of Vueling but was Schipol airport staff who was not getting the necessary information from the Vueling crew, making it difficult for him to do his job). In the end I had zero trust that this flight would ever take off after 12 hours of delay and ended buying a last minute ticket via KLM.

### "the worst airline"
London to Tunis via Barcelona. This is the worst airline I have ever taken. Flight from London to Barcelona it was delayed by almost 2hrs. Upon arriving to Barcelona, flight to Tunisia has been delayed by more than 5 hours, it was supposed to be leaving 3am morning instead of 9pm. There was no staff at the desk, no information available, no one knew nothing about the flight. It is almost 3am now, writing this & there is still no news as to when the flight will be leaving. It was my first time & very last time flying with this airline.

### "Clueless and not helpful"
Gatwick to Paris. Worst airline ever! Waited 1 hour in line only to be told the flight was canceled. Then they had no employees who could help - they have a 3rd party company who was as clueless as passengers. No one to help rebook. Horrible process to get hotel rooms, and the next day found they had automatically rescheduled to “next available flight” which was 3 days later! Customer service would not pick up calls, website is horrible to correspond with them. I had to book with another airline. I am supposed to take another flight with them today from Paris to Rome, and already flight is delayed 3 hours. Will see if we ever take off. Agents say they know nothing. No information to provide. Clueless and not helpful at all.

### "not impressed us so far"
Cardiff to Barcelona. Flight was difficult to book, wasted money on price guarantee - but eventually booked not particularly cheap flights. Very Slow check took more than 45 mins of queuing. Waited in departure lounge as our flight info was on board saying go through security. Then the flight disappeared off the board with no explanation for half an hour. Eventually told that the bags were being taken off plane and flight was cancelled. We were offered a new flight for 2.5 days later- luckily we managed to find an alternative ourselves for 1 day later - at added cost. Let’s hope we get some reimbursement but they have not impressed us so far. Never again

### "I would like my bag back"
I was impressed at first. Everything was very efficient at Ibiza airport. When I landed in Barcelona that all changed. The gate for my connecting flight changed three times and was delayed by an hour and a half. Furthermore, when I landed in Nice the baggage came out on the wrong carousel to what was advertised and took 45 mins for my bag not to arrive. It turns out with the delay in Barcelona, my bag still didn't make the flight. I will not be flying Vueling again until they sort this problem out. It's a shame because their on board product was okay. PS. If anyone from vueling is reading I would like my bag back.

### "our flights were brilliant"
Gatwick to Catania via Barcelona. I was a little apprehensive about flying with vueling after reading some bad reviews. However our flights were brilliant, no delays, it is a no frills airline but that is reflected in price and the flight crew on both flights could not have been more friendly and helpful. Will be using again!

### "no official delay announced"
Not Verified |  Nice to Barcelona. After waiting 3 hours in Nice, with no official delay announced anywhere and no employee knowing why we had to wait, we finally got into the plane but no take off. Thirty minutes later, the flight was cancelled and we all had to leave. We've only been told that some "strikes were happening somewhere and people didn't want to work extra hours". Only 10 seats available on the next flight, first arrived first served. I strongly don't recommend Vueling Airlines.

### "worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Venice to London via Paris. Worst experience ever. We flew with this airline for the first time from Venice to Paris. Check in was a nightmare. They had 1 staff initially for 3 flights which caused major delays for our flight. Made passengers reorganise their luggage. We were over on the weight limit and happy to pay the necessary amount but were then told if we don’t pay cash we will be charged an extra penalty - ridiculous procedures and policies. Although a short flight, the food cart only made it to half the plane as they were extremely slow. We took off 45 minutes behind on scheduled time. Staff do not care about service at all. Our second experience was from Paris to London that was 40 minutes late to take off. When asking questions regarding the delay we kept getting “I don’t know”. No staff to create ease of seating.

### "seats are very uncomfortable"
We did a round trip from Lisbon to Barcelona with Vueling Airlines. The planes are very small and the seats are very uncomfortable, there is no room to even get in or out of the rows, especially when the person in front of you has their seat back. The website also provides incorrect information regarding baggage fees, and apparently each country can “make up” their own rules when it comes to baggage. The inconsistency makes for a very uncomfortable and disappointing experience. I wouldn’t fly with them again.

### "incredibly unfriendly"
Palma to Lisbon. The aircraft was very dirty and smelly which made for a very disturbing flight. They simply don't clean their aircraft after their passengers deboard. Flight attendants only job seem to be selling overpriced food and were incredibly unfriendly even to kids onboard.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Menorca to Copenhagen via Barcelona. Worst experience ever. Stranded in Barcelona with minimum help from the staff. Not helpful at all - never make a trip with Vueling with connections, you will get stranded. Never to be recommended. Couldn’t even manage to get us full information about or trip.

### "It worked for me"
Amsterdam to Luton. I have often used this website to help me decide on good options for travel, so I thought it might be appropriate to start adding my views, hopefully help others in their decision making. Anyway, regarding my Vueling flight. Something came up where I needed to get over to London unexpectedly, so I didn't have time to book ahead for a reasonable price on my fare. Vueling was the only real option, so I went ahead and booked. I can happily say  my outbound flight left pretty much on time. In fact, if it wasn't for a passenger who failed to board, we would have left on schedule. The flights were very straightforward, just an up and down hour hop. I required nothing except to sit quietly and snooze, so I can't really say anything about the service onboard. The stewards did come across open and friendly when I embarked/disembarked. The planes were clean and tidy, typical budget airline set up, so minimal room. The way to Luton, the seats did not recline, which you can get away with on an hour flight, but probably isn't a great option for anything longer than that. The only real issue was on the return. The plane was 45 minutes delayed while waiting for a refuel, and we were only told were were going to be delayed after we had already boarded. Thankfully, the timing of my return was not critical. To sum up my Vueling experience. It was functional. I have nothing much to complain about, nor do I have much to say about it. It worked for me.

### "No compensation offered"
Not Verified |  Bilbao to Gatwick. Flight was cancelled at 2 hours notice for technical reasons. Vueling flight desk staff unable to find alternative flight to London for at least 2 days. No offer made of hotel accommodation support in meantime. Vueling refusing to accept any responsibility for cancellation as company now says exceptional circumstances caused cancellation. No explanation given; still awaiting reply from CEO. No compensation offered. A poor company with no capacity to support stranded customers.

### "Check-in was a disaster"
Barcelona to Paris CDG. Next time I will walk to Charles de Gaulle. Check-in was a disaster. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of passengers shoving and pushing to check in their luggage. A handful of staff offered minimal help. If you spoke English, you were out of luck. I had hoped to check my luggage through to Newark, which is why I brought all necessary boarding passes. My Spanish is ok, and I had no trouble understanding that the staff had never heard of such a thing. There was something off about the travelers too. They would aggressively push around us, in front of us, preventing our getting to the various self check in kiosks. However, they had no idea how to use them. I helped a bunch use the kiosks before ever reaching it, and saw other Americans doing the same.

### "the worst airline ever"
Milan to Barcelona. Flight cancelled when I was in front of the gate, the reason was a strike in France that they had known for days. They have never send any message about the possibility of problems with the flight. After one hour waiting at the gate one girl appeared, aggressive, unprepared, and with no idea how to give information and help customers. Vueling is the worst airline ever.

### "avoid this unscrupulous company"
Barcelona to Milan Malpensa and was scheduled to return to Barcelona from Torino. Outbound flight to Milan was fine, the typical friendly but no-frills service you can expect from them. 5 days later and we were contacted less than 24 hours prior to the scheduled departure time and told that the flight from Torino was cancelled due to strike action by air traffic controllers in Marseille. Amazing that despite the fact that the strike was called over a month prior, they wait until the last minute to announce which flights would be cancelled. They originally rebooked us on a flight two days later, but the airline said they would refuse to cover any costs (hotels, meals, etc) from having to wait an extra two days. As we needed to be back for work we chose a refund and booked a relatively expensive 12 hour night-bus from Torino to Barcelona. We waited weeks and still no refund. So we contacted Vueling only to be first told that they had no record of us having booked that flight, and in a subsequent email that we were not entitled to a refund because we boarded the (cancelled) flight! Ridiculous! We wonder whether it was a human or a robot answering the emails. It's obvious that they are doing everything in their power to avoid paying a refund which they are by law required to pay. The flight was inexpensive but it's the principal and needless to say that we will be doing our best to avoid this unscrupulous company in the future despite living in Barcelona and Vueling having a stranglehold on EU flights out of the city.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Rome to Madrid. I have waited three days for my baggage and I still can't receive any information from the airline. They have the worst customer service. Never flying in this airline again.

### "No communication of delay"
Not Verified |  London Heathrow to Barcelona. Without a shadow of a doubt, the worst airline you could have the misfortune of flying with. A simple short flight to Barcelona was delayed by over three and a half hours for no reason at all. No communication of the delay until the flight time had already passed and even less willingness to be remotely helpful shown by the ground/check in staff. Insisted I put my bag in the hold when the plane was empty. Aircraft staff apologised profusely stating the ground staff wouldn't listen to them. Whole abysmal experience was compounded by another 1hr 15 delay for the bag they insisted was put in the hold when I landed in Barcelona. Additionally, the 4 friends I was meeting in Barcelona flew from Birmingham and experienced exactly the same problems and enjoyed a 22hr delay!

### "won't book anymore with them"
Dubrovnik to Barcelona. Very bad airline. We had 2 flights with Vueling and both were over 1.5 hours delayed for both "bad weather" in Barcelona (22 celcius and sunny?). First time they gave us no approximate time which is really frustrating. Anyway, try to find an alternative, I won't book anymore with them!

### "inefficient and unapologetic"
Ibiza to Nice via Barcelona. My flight from Ibiza to Barcelona was delayed without any explanation or apology. This meant that a number of us missed our connection flights in Barcelona. We were told we will be offered assistance in Barcelona and No one in Ibiza at the Vueling desk was able to answer our questions. After this there was an announcement that in top of the delay they had overbooked the flight so were ‘looking for volunteers’ to take another flight! I was booked on another flight to Nice 11 hours later. From this point onward this airline took every opportunity to mess up its interaction with myself as a customer and many of the other stranded passengers around me.-It send us to 2 different desks on different sides of the airport to get help, the walking and queuing took more than 45 mins. If you had limited mobility, I don’t know how you would have coped. Most of the staff at the airport were too busy watching the Spain vs Portugal football match to assist and look after customers. After issuing me a new boarding pass for the flight the next day they told me to go pick up my luggage at the belt and then lost my luggage which I needed to collect to go to the hotel that night. I had to queue again at the lost luggage desk before being sent back to the belt where I waited another 20 mins before they found the bag. They put us In a hotel 40 mins from the airport each way for a flight that was at 7:20 in the morning. I was not offered information about compensation but had to specifically ask for it. They only had 1 shuttle bus scheduled per hour to the hotel and that one bus didn’t show up on time - some people waited 2.5 hours for a shuttle bus to take them to a hotel 40 mins away where we could only stay for 3 hours before being ferried back! The bus at 10pm didn’t arrive and neither did the one at 11pm. There was no staff or information to be seen anywhere. Another bus came around 11:10 and said he wasn’t going to our hotel. After about 20 mins to’ing and fro’ing it turns out he was supposed to drop us off but hadn’t been briefed about the 2 different hotels. Upon arriving at the hotel we were told there was only 1 shuttle going back to the airport and that was at 4am - only 3 hours after drop off and way too early. There was no number to call and enquire about why we can’t get a later shuttle despite being told at the airport shuttles will be arranged at multiple times. Some people at the hotel who were travelling as a group but were not family were given a triple room to sleep in as opposed to private rooms. Upon returning to the airport at 4:30am, we were asked to use the automated bag drop off. When that system didn’t accept my bag I stood in a queue for 30 mins because there was one 1 member of staff serving customers! When reaching the front of the queue I was told I have to remove items from my bag or it won’t be checked in! A bag that was meant to be in Nice alongside me celebrating my friends’ wedding 8 hours earlier. It’s unacceptable to treat people like this. Eventually I had to take things out of the bag and put them in my handbag or they wouldn’t accept the bag. The Vueling staff were unhelpful, sometimes rude, inefficient and unapologetic throughout.

### " My luggage is still lost"
Barcelona to Paris. My luggage is still lost, and I can't get anyone at Vueling to really help, every time I call I get a different story. Well every time my sister calls as she speaks Spanish because to get a hold of English speaking has been a challenge. We filed the claim but the baggage person at CDG really messed it up and I think they put the wrong tags on the bags. My bag (brown) was finally delivered to JFK, I live in ATL so they had to reroute. BTW , my sister is JFK ergo the wrong labels on the luggage. Tried to ask them to fix to no avail. Anyhow, the women at JFK gave me a rush tag number and told me the flight my bag would be on arriving from Washington at 8am, that was 6/6/18. Fast forward 6/9/18 my sisters luggage was dropped off at my home in Atlanta with a tag that states it is a brown bag, no it is a black bag and should have gone to JFK. My 60th trip which I bought all new clothes and luggage is gone. I'm glad I made it safely home the clothes can be replaced but it stinks that I am still paying off the credit bill for clothes I no longer have. This all occurred as Vueling told us our flight cancelled as well due to the strike and we were put on a different plane after about 10 hours in the airport.

### "without any of your luggage"
It is really a bad experience to be 3h late in Barcelona airport without any of your luggage. It was a easy trip from Nice to Barcelona (but it has been converted in a drama, we are all still here.

### "disappointed with this company"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Barcelona. This was my first time flying with Vueling and definitely the last time! I supposed to be flying on the 1st June from Gatwick to Barcelona. 10 minutes after  the departure when nobody at the airport knew anything they told us our flight has been cancelled?! We were told there was a strike, that's why the flight got cancelled. No communication at the airport whatsoever, we waited 4 hours at the airport for the hotel. They were telling us they can't find the hotel for us. Then after 4 hours of waiting and given only 7 GBP for a food per person they told us the shuttle is coming, but the hotel is at Radisson Blue at Heathrow? Another 1 hour on the bus. Upon arrival at the hotel again nobody knew what time is the shuttle leaving in the morning. Thanks god I woke up early so I could check at the the reception where they said the shuttle is leaving in 30 mins. They didn't even bothered to inform us/ call us. The rescheduled flight was for Sat evening which I didn't want to wait another whole day as another guests from the same flight were flying at 2pm. Again when we asked at the airport why I am flying much later I have been told it's up the price the guest paid for the flight and if the guest is flying often with them? I managed to reschedule the flight for 2pm after calling the customer service in the morning but almost didn't make it as we waited for 1 lady for over 30 mins who didn't know when is the shuttle leaving and wasn't ready. I finally made it to Barcelona with 1 day of delay. I also have been told over the phone when calling on sat 2nd of June that I am entitled for a compensation of 250 EUR. She also said to keep the receipt for some food bought on the plane and they will refund it. On the way back to Luton on the 6th June the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. What a surprise when they emailed me back today afternoon that I am getting no compensation as this wasn't their fault [congestion of the air traffic]. I was told by the lady from customer service on the phone that it was air controllers strike. Honestly this was the most stressful holiday ever for me and it ruined my holiday + I lost money for the attraction I have booked for Sat 2nd of June in Barcelona as it was non refundable. I travel a lot and this never happened to me before. Very disappointed with this company and I will never book with them again!

### "delayed and then canceled"
Birmingham to Barcelona on 6th June was at first delayed and then canceled. No communication in the airport or no one knew what is happening. After 4 hours of waiting, we were given a £3.50 voucher for refreshments. We were told to go from gate 16 to 48 then 41 and then they took us back to passport control and finally to Vueling desk where they told us the quickest flight is on Friday, the reason being that there is a storm. Curious enough the flight from Barcelona arrived. Worst, I paid for my hotel and the tickets are nonrefundable. I called their customer service about 10 times and they reject the call or put me on hold.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Definitely the worst airline I have flown. My flight from Santorini to Barcelona was delayed 2 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight. There was no attempt by Vueling whatsoever to inform any of the passengers the reason that the flight was delayed. The customer service staff at the Santorini airport and Barcelona were horrendous. When we asked Santorini customer service if we could re-book our connecting flight, all we were told was that we would be assisted in Barcelona. Upon Arrival in Barcelona we were re-booked on a flight that departed 11 hours later then my original flight. I understand that their planes may be completely full and they could not accommodate us, but to have us arrive in London 11 hours later than our original time is just unacceptable. Our baggage was lost in Barcelona as it somehow did not get placed on my flight to London even though I specifically was told that the bag would be on the flight without me having to physically check it in again. The Customer service for delayed baggage with Vueling was the worst part of my situation. The Vueling website for checking lost baggage status is a Joke! Their status on their website doesn't even keep up-to-date information. I received my bag 5 days after losing and the website still says that it is searching. Overall I would never recommend this airline even if it saves you a lot. This airline is not worth the time or hassle that you have to deal with when you fly with them.

### "no clue what was going on"
Barcelona to Birmingham. Was due to depart at 11.25, ending up departing an hour later, once we were up in the sky a high pitched noise was coming from the back door which was making people very uncomfortable an some started panicking, so after 45 mins in the air they decided to turn back to Barcelona which is understandable. However we went back to Barcelona and the pilot said that ground crew would tell us what to do, no ground crew were there and we were standing around wondering what was happening, We were ushered back through security then into the departures lounge where we had no idea where to go and the staff at the information desk had no clue what was going on, then we were told to go to a gate where we waited over an hour, people where getting tired and agitated, we were not given any food or drink. We finally left Barcelona at 4:30 with one apology from the new pilot and got back to Birmingham for 6pm - 5 hours behind schedule, its understandable that they had to turn around, but they should sort out communication with customers in these events

### "our flight had been cancelled"
Amsterdam to Rome. When arriving to Schiphol Airport in order to board there was no information of any problem related to our flight but there was no boarding gate in the info screans. We were standing on a line where Vueling was checking people in for other flights and minutes later the crew at the desk told us that our flight had been cancelled. After another hour waiting in another line, we got to know that our flight had been cancelled due to 'operational reasons' and they also told us we had to arrange ourselves a hostal because they had run out of options. Luckily we live nearby so that was not a problem for us. Long nightmare-story short, We flew next evening with them, in a half-hour delayed flight and once in the airplane we where told we had to wait 45 more minutes to take off. In our way back, our Vueling flight simply changed its departure time for half an hour later in the info displayers, they took almost 2 hours for taking off, it was lunch time and we didn't get anything (not even water for free) and they took almost 45 minutes to open the gates. The worst part of all was that there was almost no communication between the Vueling crew and the passengers in the airplane. Worst experience ever!

### "delayed with no reason"
Vueling Airlines flight delayed with no reason. No information given to the passengers. Flight postponed for two days later. No assistance for moving from the hotel to the airport, they moved us to a hotel near Charles de Gaulle Airport, but we had to fly from Orly. Two days of work lost. It was a really bad experience.

### "canceled due to strikes"
Zurich to Barcelona. Our flight with Vueling was canceled due to strikes of air traffic control in France around the 27-30th of April 2018. We had to cancel our trip. The issue is that most passengers were stranded and had to cancel their trips, and those passengers, as we were, were forced to call customer care at Vueling Airlines, and be put on hold for up to 30 minutes, repeatedly. The customer care number, if you're not calling from within Spain, cost 78c a minute. This is outrageous, because the airline is not able to process such crisis, when flight are canceled. So you may get the money back of your tickets, but if you call them from abroad, be ready to be charged half the amount in fees.

### "Both flights delayed"
Luton to Amsterdam. Both flights delayed, first one 2hr, second one about 30min. Poor customer experience, no information,  and a joke of a digital booking system, especially on mobile. Pay the extra £10 and take another airline.

### "least reliable airlines"
Vienna to Barcelona. While Vueling was one of the better low cost airlines, they now became one of the least reliable airlines in Europe. With many flights delayed or even cancelled, flying with them is comparable to playing the lottery. Their customer service is slow and only reachable through an expensive hotline or through a web form.

### "did not load all the luggage"
Lanzarote to Zurich. Vueling did not load all the luggage on the airplane. You can not make this up. It really happened. Low cost is a good thing but it should uphold a standard level of service. Recommend to look for a different carrier next time.

### "never book again with them"
Milano to Barcelona. Worst company ever. Flight cancelled one hour before departure, with no explanation, no assistance, none answering at the call center. I’ll never book again with them.

### "Worst flight experience"
Manchester to Barcelona. Initially it was delayed by an hour, but then at the gate just minutes before takeoff it was cancelled. We were then sent to the adjoining gate without any more information from them, and eventually taken back through immigration to the check in. During that time, we were crowd-controlled by being locked and left in stuffy corridors with no member of staff there on the other side of the door (probably not the individuals' fault, they were doing a good job under the circumstances and were visibly understaffed. Also the company had not actually told them what was going on either). It took about 3 hours of waiting at check-in until we found anything out. Most of what we knew ended up coming from other passengers anyway as there was almost zero control over the situation by the staff (again because there were only two of them there spread across the airport), creating a really tense and uncertain atmosphere. Also, the company didn't acknowledge that the flight had been cancelled for 2+ hours after the fact, and people were getting notifications as if it were boarding or had taken off. The website was very difficult to navigate and find any information on what was going on (especially under stress and with a phone on 8% battery). Literally the only information available was very occasional updates from staff, or from other passengers who'd actually managed to speak to them. The next day (i.e. today, and after they'd thankfully put us up in a hotel), we were shuttled to the check in desk at 7, where there was a long line that apparently had barely moved 10 feet since it opened at 6. We had to find out from other passengers what was going on (again), and it turns out that the passenger manifest had been lost by the company, and the attendants were having to manually enter everyone's details in. One of the other passengers (again, nothing told directly to us from the company) said it would be about 3 by the time the flight took off (rather than 9). Then the departure board showed that the flight was cancelled (this was news both to us and the people at the check in desk). At that point I opted to leave and take the refund rather than wait 7 hours for a flight that was probably never going to happen. I don't know if it's even taken off yet or what's happened because there is no information on the site about it. Worst flight experience of my life, less even because of the cancelled flights than the standing around waiting at the airport because the company refused to stay on top of the situation and give us clear information. All 100+ passengers spent a miserable day (two days for those who stayed) confused and stuck in an airport, and whatever the situation with the plane itself, that part was completely avoidable.

### "Ryanair are far superior"
❌ Not Verified |  Dublin to Barcelona. Currently still waiting on the plane to take off. Vueling don't allow you to check in online so you're forced to queue in a very long line in the airport. Then after rushing to the gate,it was moved to another gate,only to be told it was delayed. Finally boarded the plane after an hour to be left sitting there for another hour to eventually be told we wouldnt be leaving for another half hour because "it's the 1st of June and it's busy in Barcelona" - whatever the hell that means? I never thought I'd say this but Ryanair are far superior - and that is saying something!

### "not recommend this airline"
Barcelona to Gatwick and we were delayed for a total of 7 hours due to issues with our first aircraft. We disembarked the aircraft after an initial delay of almost 2 hours due to a funny smell on board and concerns with the safety of the aircraft. We were then left confused in the airport with no clue where to go. Eventually, we boarded the plane again only to wait even longer before being told the problem was not fixed and we needed to wait for maintenance again. Finally, a decision was made that we needed to take another aircraft. We waited and finally, the buses came to transport us to another plane. We waited in the claustrophobic bus like sardines and were not even allowed out for a while before finally being able to board our old shabby looking "new" aircraft. The staff could not care less and were of very little help throughout the whole experience, we were more of a nuisance to them than anything else. No free food was given for the whole delay. I had to pay for my food still! We were also denied the cover of our hotels even though the flight was more than 5 hours delayed. We were handed out claim forms stating our right to compensation of 250 euros. We were also told our transport costs home e.g. taxi rides home would be covered by Vueling as our arrival time was 2:30 am instead of 8:30 pm! I claimed for compensation as we were even given forms for this but I have already been denied by Vueling. I would not recommend this airline and will never fly with them again.

### "flight got cancelled"
Barcelona to Luton. Basically same problem as what had been written below. 2 hours delay, no announcement. Fly for 5 mins and turn back because the plane “hit a bird”. After 30 mins, flight got cancelled. No one to give instruction on where to go and what to do next. We went to queue up at 3 different places and eventually was given a flight to Gatwick! I parked my car at Luton. Poor communication and bad management. Avoid at all cost.

### "didn't offer us any drink or free food"
Vueling Airlines delayed the flight for at least 3 hours, 2 of those hours were inside the plane at Barcelona Airport. They didn't offer us any drink or free food. I asked the manager for a complaint form and she said that they had run out of forms and that they couldn't offer us any other drinks apart from water for free. (no free food no vouchers, when they should have been offered free food because the delay was longer than 1.5 hours).

### "Absolutely shocking"
Haven’t actually flown with them because my flight that I had booked got moved because their pilots went on strike! I then couldn’t make the date they had moved them to so I asked for a full refund which they granted me, but
a month later I have not recieved my money for the flight. I’ve also had no luck trying to get to the bottom of where my money is, all I’m being told is that I will get my money but they don’t know when? Absolutely shocking, will not be using these ever again and will be letting everyone know how bad Vueling Airlines is.

### "hand luggage was taken off us"
Luton to Barcelona. Outbound flight flight delayed by 3 hours. When boarding the plane our hand luggage was taken off us and put in main hold due to some of the overhead lockers being broken so not enough room. So arriving in Barcelona at 2:30am (3 hours late) and then having to wait around for our hand luggage arrive meant that we didnt actually get to our hotel room until 4am. Inbound flight Information boards display our 18:55 flight is estimated at 21:40. We walked round the airport trying to work off the anger. Delayed. Again! After having a drink and returning to the board (at 18:45) board now displays estimated 19:10. Run to gate to queue as they arent letting us on yet (now 19:00). Seats in row 31 and the closest space in the overhead storage was above row 24. 1 space. The other bag was taken down to row 11 - 20 rows between us and our luggage! Staff were rude and unfriendly. Take off finally at 8pm. Land in Luton and as everyone stands up and grabs their stuff to leave we realise we need to get out of everyones way to let them off to get to row 11! Everyone is queued up, stairs get attached, doors opened and they still refuse to let us off the plane. All lights go out, several times. Announcement eventually came over to explain there were too many people in the airport and too short staff we couldnt get off the plane. Oh and little tip to anyone still considering using them, when choosing seats online, dont choose row 32 - row 32 does not exist.

### "do not recommend them at all"
Amsterdam to Barcelona. On our outbound flight, in spite of booking for priority boarding we we two of the last passengers to board as the economy passengers were allowed to board first although we arrived at the aircraft before them. Our return flight was disastrous with a 7 hour delay while waiting for a crew to arrive from Barcelona, during which nobody from Vueling came to explain the delay to us and the information received by the ground crew in Schipol was erratic at best and totally incomplete. We had to move from one terminal to another three times! I feel very sorry for the group of elderly passengers that were on the same flight. The meal voucher came very late and the inconvenience was made even worse by the fact that during the flight these was no food or drinks available for purchase, not even coffee - only water. I had to cancel college today and my companion had to call in absent from work as we only got home at 5.30 am this morning instead of at about 22.30pm last night. I definitely will not fly with Vueling again by choice and do not recommend them at all.

### "My flight was cancelled"
❌ Not Verified |  Barcelona to Bologna. Worst airline I’ve flown in. Poor service, poor staff at Barcelona Airport, poor assistance. Everything is at very low level except their cancellation rate, that one is extremely high. My flight to Bologna was cancelled with a notification of only 6 hours without even an email notification. Nobody provided me with the information I needed and they didn’t even provide the taxi from my accommodation to the airport. Nobody should  fly this airline, even if it’s the cheapest option!

### "no communication"
❌ Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Barcelona. Don't do it. Endless delays and lies, no communication, unusable vouchers. Were supposed to fly at 1855 delayed until 0210 next day with practically no communication. They knew this was going to happen by about eight but never communicated until plane was about to take off. We could have rescheduled if we would have been notified on time.

### "flight was cancelled"
Paris to Valencia. Our Vueling flight was cancelled because of technical problems on a Friday night, so we decided to buy a new one to a city two hours away from our initial destination and rented a car to get there. Instead of our initial arrival time of 19pm, we reached our destination at 3am (the alternative would have been a flight the next day in the afternoon, which if you are going for a weekend is not really an option). On the way back we had our Vueling flight at 7am, but as we found out at the gate, right before entering the plane, Vueling had cancelled our return flight as well. We had at no time requested the cancellation of the return flight. We had not received any communication from Vueling on our return flight being cancelled. We had obviously no interest in cancelling neither of the two flights we booked. There were still seats available on that flight but they wouldn't let us board. Vueling did not support us to get back home, we had to buy ourselves a new flight. Vueling did not offer us any compensation for the hours and money we lost this weekend. Be aware how powerless you are as a single person towards this company and how customer unfriendly Vueling is.

### "Never again Vueling"
❌ Not Verified |  Planned to fly with Vueling from Florence to Amsterdam. At the gate we were told the aircraft was’t able to land due to strong winds and landed on an other airport nearby, we would be transfered to this airport with the bus. In the meantime other planes are landing and departing continously. Later on we were told, we would fly from Florence but with a delay of 1.45h. Not a sign of any transparency through the entire process, since the website told completely other things than the people on the ground. After +2 hours of waiting we were told the flight was cancelled. This cancellation caused enormous chaos since the entire airport was empty and it was around 22.30pm. One person was assigned to help us out, which caused another hour or something of waiting. Our relocated flight was the next day late in the afternoon, which we did not accept. Service from vueling was horrible and I do not recommend it at all. Next flight a few days later, from Rome to Amsterdam this time, again +2 hours of delay. With again no transparency at all, first they told us about the weather, later on operational causes were blamed. We found out the flight was delayed through google, airport displays did not tell us anything. Neither did the people on the ground, they told us there could be some delay but they were not sure. Turned out google was right and the flight got delayed +2 hours. Never again Vueling.

### "you will regret it"
Flew Vueling from Munich to Barcelona. The most horrible airline. Extremely high flight cancellation chance. Once your flight is cancelled, you will receive no notification. I found it out by opening the app 2 days before and saw the info within the app. It automatically selected their cheapest available flight on a different day by default. Thanks to this great airline, I had to leave my vacation earlier than planned, getting much lesser value for my trip. You think you might be saving some money choosing this airline? Promise you, you will regret it.

### "talking only in Spanish"
Flight attendants during my trip from Marseilles to Barcelona were great and polite. They have done a great job during that flight. However the pilot when he spoke to passengers over the PAh was talking only in Spanish - not acceptable on an international airline on an international flight. Another issue happened when I was flying from Barcelona to Copenhagen (26th May 09:50). Vueling gate staff repeatedly spoke to people only in Spanish and I ended up queuing in a wrong lane (for different row numbers, not different class)

### "a hot mess"
Ibiza to Madrid. Don’t be seduced by their low prices! Vueling is a hot mess. Both of my flights to and from Ibiza were delayed over two hours - both via Madrid. The airline has been very apologetic, and their cabin crews have been lovely. But guys, don’t be the MegaBus of European airlines! Fix it!

### "Terrible customer service"
Rome to Gatwick. Terrible customer service from the point of check in to arrival. Bad communication, no courtesy, later departure, uncomfortable and very basic cabin and seats. I would not recommend or fly with again.

### "disappointed with the service"
❌ Not Verified |  Cardiff to Alicante. Very disappointed that the cabin crew would not serve alcohol to any passengers because a group of drunk ladies boarded the plane. Surely these ladies should have been refused to board. There were passengers drinking alcohol on the plane that they had bought themselves. This was pointed out to the cabin crew and it was ignored. Very disappointed with the service and the cabin crew who were also quite rude. No sandwiches on board either on a 12.50 flight.

### "always a delay"
This time again a massive delay. On a flught of 1h 15 min delay of 1 h 30 min. Chaos with seating. I flew in the past Vueling more often but stopped due to delays. On my last 3 flights where i just couldnt avoid them (Malaga - Zurich, Mallorca - Paris and now Malaga - Barcelona) always a delay more than 1 hour. Apart from that there was always chaos at the time of boarding. And checking in the luggage is a joke - huge lines of waiting.

### "extremely disappointed"
Rome to Gatwick. We were extremely disappointed by the rude staff (except the captain). The attendants did no attending not even offering water to drink. Did not explain anything about customs when landing or where baggage claim was. Before the flight at the airport, we had 3 bags that were carry on size and they said we had to check them. (We thought this was because there was no room on board - but the flight was only half-full) The very rude staff made us pay for 2 of our luggage giving us one free (how nice). The charge was the same as 2 passenger flights. We can see how they scam people of their money. Charging cheap flights and making their money on the bags. I do not recommend this airline terrible! We do recommend easyJet which we flew 1st and they are amazing! Funny friendly staff eager to help. Great deal and no fuss. We didnt have to pay for the same bags on this flight either.

### "a horrible customer service"
I had a flight from Geneva to Barcelona at 18:30. The flight was delayed and supposed to fly at 19:25. At 19:40 they say it will fly at 20:00 and 5 mins later they say it's cancelled due to technical issues. They advised us to go to a specific place to get our baggage and the bags were at a totally different place, which I only found out from another passenger. After this they advised us to go to a travel agency to get help. The only help was to give us a phone number to call Vueling or to wait the airline to send us an email! This email came hours later! When I called the number they gave us the person I spoke to didn't even know the flight was cancelled and couldn't help me. He advised me to speak to the helpdesk at the airport! One of the passengers advised me to download their app in order to find out when did the airline scheduled the next flight for me to reach my destination. Although my initial flight was direct, they rescheduled me for a flight via Rome!! On top of that I had to wait another hour in a queue to find out which hotel they are going to send us to. They sent us to a hotel 1,5 hour far by bus because the hotels in Geneva were fully booked!!! Overall, a horrible customer service

### "I am so disappointed"
We had the flight from Amsterdam to Barcelona and I was extremely disappointed. First of all our flight delayed for 4 hours (as company announced becuase of the strike in France). Then 4 hours later finally we went to the plane, but it just standed about one hour and didnt take off. Clearly, all customers were very nervous and worried about this situation. But the staff wjust even ignored the callings of clients and didnt reach to anyone for a long time because they didnt want to listen and to calm anyone. I pushed the call button about 10 times jut to get a glass of water, but they ignored me and others and got us even more angry. I am so disappointed.

### "Never this airline again"
Barcelona to Geneva. Our flight was last minute cancelled on May 13th, and we received a relocated flight for May 17th only. We were blocked in Barcelona with no possibilities to come back earlier for our jobs. No possibility as well to request for a claim on Vueling Airlines web site, as we had to rent a car for our trip back, that costs us more than 1'000 euros. Never this airline again.

### "Avoid if you can"
Lisbon to Barcelona, just as we were on the way to the airport, Vueling announced by SMS that there might be a delay, their website indicated 2 hours. Later however that disappeared to say the flight would be on time, but at the airport no departure gate was announced and the flight was neither indicated as boarding nor as delayed. No staff was present to give information or meal vouchers. Eventually they would "board" passengers onto buses, were we were held for about 40 minutes since it turned out the incoming plane had barely arrived and wasn't ready. Seats were crammed as usual on Vueling and they seem to be one of the last airplanes on earth that still don't allow Bluetooth. Arriving in BCN the aircraft eventually did the most aggressive descent I've ever seen (I've arrived at this airport more times than i can count) and instead of the usual passenger bridge we disembarked by bus, opening the aircraft doors with 2h53m of delay. The staff was quick to remind we wouldn't have a right to compensation since it was less than 3 hours. Avoid if you can.

### "never recommend Vueling"
A Coruña to London. A little over a year ago I was 45 minutes before my flight at Heathrow and I wasn’t allowed to get into my flight because I hadn’t done my check in online. I had to go back home to then come back the day after, paying an extra fee on top of the already expensive flight. Last night my flight was delayed, making me wait an extra hour at the airport, and I was back late to London. I am extremely unhappy with this service (specially considering the price - 225 EUR buying the flight in advance, last time i paid over 300 EUR). Last time they made me pay big time for my delay, and this time they discarded my claim refusing to do anything about it. I can't wait to the day a better airline flies to my hometown. I will never recommend Vueling.

### "an absolute disgrace"
Barcelona to Gatwick. Vueling Airlines is an absolute disgrace. As a customer you may get delays, seat overbooking (+10 seats) or a last minute cancelation. These are accompanied by a shocking lack of communication and customer service. So, if you don't want your travel plans ruined then pay a little extra and fly with a more reputable airline.

### "Barcelona to Brussels"
Barcelona to Brussels. Worst experience ever. We waited 5 hours for our flight that was delayed because no pilot was assigned to our flight. For a flight planned at 18.30, we finally got information at 21.00, that we will board at 23.00. At 22.30 we receive information that our flight is finally cancelled. After queuing again for 1 hours, I receive a voucher for an hotel located 60kms away from the airport and the city, we wait another 30 mins in front of at least 5 buses (other clients from other flights had been rejected for "overbooking") we arrive at the hotel at 2am, and I am now currently kicked out of the room because of check out time at 10am. I am therefore waiting at the reception for the bus to pick me up at 3pm, so another 5 hours to wait and there is nothing to do here as we are in the middle of no where. And I dont even have a voucher for my lunch, I have to pay myself. This is so scandalous.

### "flight was continuously delayed"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Paris to Barcelona. The flight was continuously delayed. The boarding was firstly delayed almost 1 hour. Then after boarding 1 hour delayed, we had to wait 40 more minutes in the plane without knowing what was going on. As this delay wasn't enough, the seats weren't comfy at all. For a tall guy (1.85 m or more) it is almost impossible to stay with such a small space between the seats for a full flight without getting horrible cramps. Moreover, some of the seats were broken and they couldn't get to the bended position. To conclude, if it's not your only option, I recommend you not to pick it.

### "They canceled my flight"
Luton to Florence. They canceled my flight at the departure time, no Vueling official at the airport to give explanations, they changed my flight for the other day from another airport to 100 km from Luton and to Rome instead of Florence. That flight scheduled at 2050, left two hours late, arrived in Rome at 1:40 and until 6 o'clock no Vueling official could solve my transfer to Florence.

### "flight was delayed by 2 hours"
Luton to Barcelona. Worst experience ever. Do not advice anyone for this flight. The flight was delayed by 2 hours and arrived when the car hire company closed. Took a taxi for 100 euro to the hotel because of the late arrival.

### "no checked bags were loaded"
Florence to  Gatwick. Outward flight left on time luggage arrived cabin crew great so good. Return flight Vueling lived up to their reputation - boarded left sitting there for over an hour after expected departure time announcement. Cabin crew were lovely no complaints. 1 loo blocked so not operational, big queues but not really a drama. The drama when we arrived immediately told at Gatwick no checked bags were loaded because it was too windy & there was a weight issue. I'm lucky after filling in form, global baggage solutions delivered my case today 48 hrs late - my sister who lives in Scotland fingers crossed hers will be delivered too. Dont lie Vueling, your clients are not idiots & we dont appreciate being treated as such, just be honest.

### "Never fly with Vueling"
Dubrovnik to London Stansted. Never fly with Vueling. No one in their company ever knows what is going on. I was supposed to fly from Croatia to London and the engine failed on our plane and they told me I would be stranded for a week. They did not provide accommodations for my friend and I. We are 20 year old girls alone and they left us in the middle of nowhere. On top of that we were promised 250 euro compensation and it has now been over 2 months and I am yet to receive the money. I have lost hundreds of dollars to this company. Every time I call I have been hung up on and they refuse to allow me to talk to a supervisor. They have told me three times in a row when I will receive my money and each time they fail to follow through with their promise. Vueling is a terrible airline and I would not fly with them under any circumstances.

### "efficient little flight"
❌ Not Verified |  A Coruña to London. On time, efficient little flight. No problems. Quick enough to board, stewardess were polite. Would fly again. People need to appreciate these are a budget airline so you get what you pay for. If you don't expect spoiling, you shouldn't be disappointed

### "time to not be on time"
Never take this airline as a connection, only take it if you have time to not be on time. I bought 5 tickets, where 2 were delayed, 1 was cancelled and 2 were on time. Amsterdam to Barcelona on time, Barcelona to Valencia 1h 50m late (too late for a connection flight and had to buy a new ticket) Amsterdam to Porto on time, Lisbon to Amsterdam Cancelled (due to a strike) and moved to 2 days later (we got hotel, beverages and food all included, very good service) or we could get our money back plus compensation to find another ticket. Lisbon to Amsterdam 2.30h late. As you can see, not a very good number only two out of 5 tickets got me there in time. The personnel was very nice, probably also a bit annoyed by the delays. The ground personnel was not very friendly, the service is okay, the communication is great. I don't complain often, but these are my basic expectations of a low cost company: Get me there and on time!

### "not recommend this airline"
Barcelona to Amsterdam. Series of worst experiences ever. I would not give this airline another chance. I am an international student in Barcelona staying under valid student residency permit (NIE), which legally allows me to travel to Schengen states in Europe. I was denied to board on the plane from Barcelona to Amsterdam because their internal policy did not take my student NIE as official residency permit (which is not aligned with the law.) The plane took off, and I went to Police Immigration and confirm that I am legally allowed to travel with my documents. I checked with other airlines (Ryanair, transavia) to confirm that I can fly with my documents. After having the police talk to Vueling, they do some internal coordination to make an exception for me to put me on the flight next day. Since they told me that there is no guarantee this same trouble would not happen again, so I wanted to get refund and fly with another airline, but they refused. After writing a formal complaint though their customer service, explaining how they are being discriminatory toward certain nationalities to not allow them to travel when they are legally entitled to, they refunded my ticket, but instead of refunding one-way, they refunded my return ticket as well from Amsterdam to Barcelona without my consent and I could not get on my flight back at night, ended up staying one more night in Amsterdam and buying another flight at much more expensive fare. They over booked me and put me in the flight next day. They said after sending bank account information it would take few days to transfer, and now after 12 days, I still haven't received anything (I think they do this on purpose.) Dealing with Vueling is very stressful, ends up costing you more, and I would not recommend this airline to anyone.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Budapest to Barcelona. This is the worst airline I have travelled with! Both ways the flight were delayed by hours. Different boarding time were announced several times, because they couldn’t make the first. Both ways the gates were changed three times. Extremely disappointing experience!

### "such a terrible experience"
Fez to Barcelona. Flight delayed 13+ hours. Worst customer service I have ever experienced, no updates or news on why the plane was delayed. Apparently there was no actual plane to board!! It took 13 delayed hours to arrange a plane, pilot and cabin crew. The plane was filthy (crumbs, food, rubbish) when we got on, so obviously not cleaned before we departed, but by then I was relieved to be in the air. Never had such a terrible experience in all my years of flying! !

### "I am deeply disappointed"
My trip started in Stuttgart, I was supposed to fly into Barcelona and catch my connecting flight to Naples there. I was going to stay in Naples for the weekend of Nov 17-19, 2017. As I was only staying there for a weekend, I only had hand luggage with me. As I was boarding the plane, the flight attendant took away my backpack claiming the aircraft was full and I had to check my bag. Since I had not planned on checking it, I had nothing with me when they lost the luggage. They found it two days later and let me pick it up on my way back to Stuttgart. In the meantime, I had numerous expenses of about 100-150€. I learned recently that you can get a refund for luggage mishandling. I called the airline several times, but they are refusing to handle my case. They do not seem willing to help me with my request. I am deeply disappointed in their customer service.

### "terrible experience"
Paris to Prague. Beware, just because you purchased a ticket doesn't mean you'll have a seat on your flight! Eventually haggled hard enough to make our way on, but terrible experience nonetheless - late flight and non existent service. You get what you pay for with these clowns.

### "Very satisfied about the flight"
Amsterdam to Barcelona. I really do not get why there are so many negative reviews, this flight was very good. Nice new plane. Friendly staff. Sure you have to pay for your drinks but you know that in front. And 2.5 euro for beer is a very good price. Space is not much but for a flight of less than 2 hours it is fine. Very satisfied about the flight.

### "how can they be so late?"
Late again. They were late flying from Barcelona to Malta on 11th April, but on the return trip it was even way worse. 21st April return. Supposed to be leaving at 00:10h but acccording to them (their website) they left: 02:03h. Strange that my watch was showing 02:13. They clocked just before the famous 2 hours "free drink" and mine after. With so few people on the plane, how can they be so late - and at this time at night. At 01:55 they sent an email what we are finally have to go to the gate and at 02:03 - just 8 minutes later - the plane leaves. Never ever. And why do they send emails that they are late and not SMS messages? Surely I don't want to check emails ever minute when waiting for my plane.

### "seem somewhat better than Ryanair"
Barcelona to Seville. I like Vueling. They operate on time, have newer aircraft, and have convenient schedules with good airfares. They seem somewhat better than Ryanair. This flight was no exception; on-time, good boarding process, good baggage handling, nice crew, well-flown. Nothing to complain about given the cost. Seats are very tight of course and do not recline but since it was a 1.5 hour flight it didn't matter.

### "the flight closed 2 minutes ago"
Barcelona to Copenhagen. Terrible airline. We arrived at the airport more than an hour before a short flight. We asked Vueling agent where to go for check in to the flight and gave her departure time and destination she directed us to a long line of people checking into a different flight. We asked her if this is the correct line and if we had enough time to check in and board she said yes. When I got to the ticket counter the agent said that the flight closed 2 minutes ago although it was still 50 minutes until Boarding time. She said we should have been directed to the last minute line to check in on time. When we asked why the first agent directed us to the wrong line they simply said they don’t know and don’t care. They did not let us on the flight over 2 minutes after directing us to the wrong line. They do this on purpose to sell more flights. Beware of this trick they will delay you on purpose to make you miss your flight. Not to mention the next Vueling flight I purchased was delayed by several hours and so they did not clean or restock the plane for the next flight, there was trash everywhere and no food and beverages available because they did not restock.

### "entire flight uncomfortable"
Marseille to Rome Fiumicino. I entered in the cabin with a seat pich of 29 inches and I have been asked to put my laptop case under the seat. The pitch does not allow me to have my feet on the ground with the case. I have been forced to do it and to have the entire flight in an uncomfortable and likely unsafe condition due to impossibility to have my legs in normal position. I do not imagine how this could comply with the airworthiness regulations concerning the passenger position on the seat

### "worst airline I have experienced"
Paris to Barcelona. Definitely the worst airline I have experienced. First of all we were meant to board to fly out at 10.05am but the flight then got delayed without any notification on the gate screen until 15mins later. They said gate changed so we all went there and then delayed the flight again another hour. But on the email from Vueling it delayed us to fly out at 1pm but the gate officers said they were still scheduled to fly at now 12pm. There was no communication between the airline and gate crew. The gate crew even said the airline is not communicating well. Now I have missed my next connecting flight.

### "I expected warning to my delay"
Due to fly London Luton to Amsterdam. I don’t write reviews but since I have 2 hours to spare due to the second delay from Vueling, I will. When I arrived to check in, I was also not informed of this delay. The first delay (only 3 days prior) was 40 minutes and today’s delay was 2 hours for a one hour flight. I will now arrive home at midnight which will in turn cause me to miss all of the trains home and I will have to catch a 29-40€ Uber. I understand this is a budget airline so I won’t mention the lack of food, entertainment and service, however at the very least I expected warning to my delay and less frequent delays. It’s a joke, I’m currently quite sick and the last thing you want is to delay your flight home on a Sunday night to midnight with work the next day.

### "Seat pitch smallest I've seen"
Milan to Amsterdam. The cabin was piping hot when we were about to take off. A/C clearly malfunctioning. Staff was extremely inattentive and did not seem to care about passengers who were trying to understand what was wrong. Seat pitch smallest I've seen on any European airline including Ryanair. I strongly discourage anyone from flying this airline.

### "I received no compensation"
Florence to Gatwick. Took off from Florence late. About 30 minutes into the flight, the plane was turning at angles back and forth. We were told to put seats up and tray tables away. We were not told where we were landing until I asked and a flight attendant said there was a problem with the door. We landed in Pisa and the crew said nothing and gave no additional information. We had to deboard the plain to refuel, then took off again to Gatwick. I received no compensation from the airline.

### "about 100 minutes late"
Barcelona to Copenhagen with A321. Aircraft ready on the tarmak and first bus with about 50% of passenger left from gate in good time. We had seats on row 6 so we were told to wait to next bus. After 20 minutes all passengers from first bus came back. No explanation from Vueling. After a while I succeed to get information they changed the aircraft from A321 to a A320. After a while we all passenger who got a seat were sitting in the plane 2.20 pm, a 1 hour delay. The pilot inform us that we lost the slot departure time and we had to wait for a while, probably one hour. We were waiting in the aircraft and exactly at 3.20 pm the pilot turn on the engines and informed the staff that we were going to leave! Arrived at CPH 6.10 pm, about 100 minutes late. I got information from a flight attendant during the flight who said our A321 had been taken to another destination. So when flying with Vueling even if your aircraft arrives in good time time to your departure airport, even if the aircraft is in good shape etc, it does not mean that you flight will depart in time.

### "they cancelled the flight"
Had a recent “disappointing” experience with Vueling Airlines. Our original flight from Dubrovnik to Rome on March 17th. The the initial flight was delayed due to bad weather and I accept this delay, however, after 5 hrs they cancelled the flight. They provided a €6 coupon during the delay and then placed us in a hotel. After contacting them, we were informed that we were on a flight the following day to Rome, via Barcelona, with a transit of 6hrs and arriving in Rome at midnight. It has to be noted that there was nothing offered by the airline. It should be noted here, that all public transport does not operate at this time, a taxi into the centre costs between €45-60. I felt that due to all the inconvenience, the compensation was not suffice. I approached the airline with my dissatisfaction in what were offered, as the whole weekend was was diminished to spending time in a airport! Only to have this message repeatedly sent back to me, "We are contacting you in response to your request. Following our resolution to your case in our previous e-mail, we proceeded to revise this case and have verified that our company has complied at all times with our Conditions of Carriage and the current European air travel regulation. Please note that we offered food vouchers and hotel to all affected passengers who requested it at the airport. Once again, we regret not being able to honor your request. We remain at your disposal for any other doubts or questions". To conclude, I feel that the delay/cancellation was not appropriately compensated and the attitude of the airline was very 'robotic and distant'!

### "the customer service is abysmal"
I have never had a positive experience with Vueling but have refrained from writing a bad review until today. I usually avoid this airline at all costs as it is constantly late and the customer service is abysmal. The flight was 40 minutes late today despite it leaving at 8.30 in the morning. Once we landed in Barcelona, late, we had to wait on a bus on the tarmac for 20 more minutes because the plane didn’t have a gate. When I tried to make my connecting flight, which I needed to make today for personal and time sensitive family reasons (that I explained to the representatives), I was told that because the gate was closed I would not be allowed to board. This is especially deplorable because I flew on a Vueling flight, was only late because Vueling was late, and therefore wasn’t allowed to board my Vueling connecting flight even though it was still sitting at the gate for the next half hour. I will never ever fly this airline again.

### "showed little care"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Barcelona to London Luton. Worst airline I have ever experienced. Will never use again. Flights to and from Spain were delayed, majority of staff showed little care and were downright rude. On return to London, waited in three different check out lines, being sent all over the airport due to staff incompetence. When we were finally able to check in, we were told they had filled the plane and we would not get a seat. Again, zero care from staff, meet with only rudeness.

### "have to wait at the carousel"
Birmingham to Barcelona. Not recommended if you’re wanting to fly with carryon only for quick exit. Staff let first passengers take too much stuff onboard then make later ones leave their legitimate carryon in the hold. That means you’ll have to wait at the carousel for your carryon to come round. Frustrating.

### "I can't recommend this airline"
Paris CDG to Prague. Flight was operated from terminal 3, which give you feeling you are on some tiny airport not Charles de Gaule, but it's low cost airline so ok, boarding was done by bus (there are no jet bridges in terminal 3) and was on time as entire flight and smooth. My seat is not that thin, so sitting on it is ok, but there is no seat pocket, just place for magazines (so at least better than Ryanair), but leg room is terrible. Shortly after take off, there was possibility to buy  food and drinks and selection was actually pretty good (even though they run out of club sandwich), but I ordered menu for 10 (11 with beer) and sandwich was heated and was good, it's true that Easyjet have it a bit cheaper, but I don't think that 1 Euro make big difference. There was no duty free (which I don't mind and I think its waste of time), instead crew collected garbage twice on this short flight. So positives were, on time, good crew and tasty food, negatives; terrible seat and thanks to this terrible seat I can't recommend this airline, especially not on flights longer than 1 and half hour (if you are over 160cm), only way to fly them is to book extra legroom which costs 15 - 20 Euros extra, which is ok, but there is only 12 of them.

### "the most incompetent company"
Barcelona to Athens. This has been a 6 month ordeal. Vueling double checked and assured us our bags were on our flight and then proceeded to lose our bags in Greece, not even able to tell us which airport they were at. We kept every receipt, per their instructions and were told that at the very least we would be given a $50 stipend for everyday they were missing (3 full days). All three of us lost our bags. We spent hours itemizing our receipts and compiling exact forms per their instructions to submit to the airline (which came to almost 900 Euros with missed connections and changes trying to get our bags). We often had to wait 3-4 weeks per each question or inquiry we made. Every time we called it was ground hogs day, and their employees were incredibly rude. They ended up giving all three of us total $239.00 which is significantly less than even the $450.00 they promised when they initially lost our bags. They also gave us no reason for the amount they sent us (after 38 emails and 6 months). They are the most incompetent company I have ever dealt with in my life. Would give them a negative number if possible.

### " This is a disgrace"
Barcelona to Manchester. I booked business class with Iberia, on arrival everything looked fine until I got my boarding tickets that did not now have business class on but ‘fast track’ - this is exactly what it says on the tin, you get to jump a few small queues. I got on the plane to find out that business class with Vueling means extra leg room which I could get on any flight for £10 extra charge! I am outraged I could have saved over half of the plane ticket by simply getting a normal flight and then adding extra leg room. This is a disgrace never use Vueling.

### "Just don't do it"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Prague to Barcelona. Here's the thing. If you are like me and seek cheap flights, this is not the way you want. Terrible service, terrible mess in the airplane, terrible everything. Not to mention that the flight was delayed by an hour with no excuse. Just don't do it.

### "over our expectation"
Lisbon to Barcelona. On time and acceptable quality with very low price! My husband and I were really worried reading a lot of negative feedback of Vueling. We booked 2 trips: 1 from Barcelona to Granada, and one from Lisbon back to Barcelona. Our two flights are on time and over our expectation. Everything is quite good for low-price airline. Highly recommend!

### "seats left and they were cheap"
Luton to Barcelona. After horrendous weather conditions causing me to be stranded in Luton. I had to travel at very short notice to Barcelona. I found that Vueling had seats left and they were cheap. On boarding the plane I could only just fit in the seat, knees pushed hard up against the seat in front. It was a free for all with everyone rushing onto the plane all at the same time. Trolley service very expensive and still serving when we started descent. No updates on flight times or eta. All in all it was probably one of the worst flights I have had to endure.

### "Very poor customer service"
Barcelona to Gatwick. When I checked in online, the system apparently did not save my seat selection. I tried calling the customer service line and could not get through. When I checked in at the airport, I found out they assigned me a seat in the 2nd to last row, which I was very unhappy with. On the flight, they didn’t provide meal service to the last 5 rows due to the descent. This was a 2 hour and 20 minute flight. There should have been plenty of time to serve all of us. They didn’t even tell us we would not be served, just rolled the cart to the back. Very poor customer service experience.

### "start to finish a shambles"
Barcelona to Edinburgh. Whole operation from start to finish was a shambles. Flight took off 45 minutes late, only after queuing for 30 minutes to get on the plane as staff were tagging other people's hand luggage at the front door to go in the hold. By the time I boarded there was no overhead luggage space anyway so I had to fit my backpack under the seat in front. After landing we could only disembark using the front entrance so had to wait another 15 minutes for everyone in front to get off. Earlier in the day I decided I would wait until on the aircraft to have something to eat. Trolley service did not reach me until we had been in flight for 2 hours (this is on a 2h 20min flight) by which time I was told the hot food was "finished" and I only had the choice of snacks. Decided against buying anything - maybe a blessing in disguise as the food menu is eye-wateringly expensive. A thank you to the pilot for their duty in getting me home is perhaps the only praise I would give this airline.

### "assistance provided has been terrible"
They have cancelled 2 flights in 48 hours. Both going to Barcelona. The assistance provided has been terrible. No explanation was given. The cancellation was announced 5 minutes before bording. They have ruined my vacation. Vueling Airlines are a joke not an airline.

### "was let down, lost my Flight"
Gatwick to Florence. Vueling is a disastrous company. I've always had problems, flight delays, ridiculous luggage policy and would never have booked it again. This time I was on a business trip and ticket was bought by someone else. They did oversell tickets and I was let down, lost my Flight, meetings and everything arranged.

### "cabin crew was friendly"
Valencia to Brussels. It was a good flight and the cabin crew was friendly and will try to help you if you have a question. It was an  A320 without entertainment. For a low-cost-company, you had enough space (i'm 187cm), so better than you can have with traditional airlines.

### "they never transferred our bags"
I booked flights for the morning from Rome to Gatwick via Barcelona. Arrive at the airport 2 hours before flight is due to leave as standard! Get to the departure gate to fine boarding has been delayed for 30 mins, no reason given. Finally get on to the plane,  wait another hour in very uncomfortable seats awaiting takeoff. Due to the hour delay we then missed our connection flight in Barcelona so we then had to wait another 5 hours in Barcelona! Not much of a good will token given for the delay, a terrible dinner. Finally 5 hours later get ushered on to a bus that drove us to the awaiting plane. We're made to stand out in the cold as row by row we were told to get on the plane, the reason for this was due to balance issues. Then another hour wasted once on the plane waiting for take off. Food is pretty disappointed considering the price charged! Then finally get back to the UK, made to get off the plane row by row because of balance issues. Get through to baggage collection thinking I just want this rubbish experience to end to only find out that they never transferred our bags across & out bags are still in Barcelona whilst we're in the UK, unfortunately I was not the only passenger missing luggage there were 25+other flyers from the original flight from Rome missing luggage too!

### "Staff who hate working with the public shouldn’t"
Flew London Heathrow to Barcelona. Ungracious, unsmiling and unfriendly crew, should have chosen better. On boarding, not so much as a grin, less so a smile from the crew. Ridiculously tight seat pitch saw legs spilling into the aisle every few feet (pardon the pun). My husband took a photo to send to a friend illustrating how far back we were (way back) which happened to show the back of a stewardess in the distance. Another member of the crew told her and she got quite stroppy. Her: You can’t take photos. Husband: Why? Her: Because I said. Mr Chief misery crew then turns up and demands that the photo (showing someone’s back) is deleted, pointing to the security card as if there were some stated rule in it. There wasn’t. Deleted photo anyway, Mr Chief misery crew then takes phone to delete said photo from the trash box. Talk about an over reaction. Mr Chief misery crew then berates another passenger, no Bluetooth headphones allowed! Another passenger (third row from back) approaches crew member because they weren’t asked if they wanted drinks. Crew: Maybe somebody else will come and serve you drinks. They didn’t. Passenger presses call button and asked for a drink (after explaining the situation). Crew member: No, it’s too late! (Before complaining, in Spanish, and laughing with other crew). Seat belt light on for the duration of the flight, presumably to keep passengers from bothering staff. Captain made tannoy at end of flight (because he’d forgotten to earlier?) to say which route we’d flown. Staff who hate working with the public shouldn’t. Or perhaps it’s just a reflection of the unemployment situation in Spain, people will take any job and woe betide anybody who expects any level of customer service. First time I’ve flown Vueling and, short of the flight home, the last.

### "no suitcase or follow up from Vueling"
I’m on vacation and flew Vueling on January 5th 2018 from Paris to Palermo with a connection in Barcelona. Unfortunately, the Vueling representative didn’t put a baggage tag on my checked in suitcase. My suitcase was left behind in Paris (as confirmed by Vueling) – Vueling sent my suitcase to Palermo (for delivery to me in Ortigia, Sicily) – I called the airport daily to find out the status of my suitcase – Palermo airport told me on January 11th, that my suitcase was given to a courier for delivery. I called daily after that to inquire about the courier’s whereabouts. After hearing lie and misleading information numerous days in a row, the airport finally admitted they had no way to follow-up with the courier – I called Vueling on January 17th and they advised that my case was closed because the courier told them they had delivered my suitcase. I told Vueling the delivery did not happen. They responded that they would follow up with the courier and open a police report. 16 days later and still no suitcase or follow up from Vueling.

### "that was my last time"
Milan to Barcelona. I wanted to travel with my budgie. While you can easily find which documents you need to travel with dogs, there's nothing about birds. The request of documents depends by the legislation of the Country and at the check in they gave me a wrong info said me was about EU legislation. In fact I didn't have any problems in Spain (where I called a veterinarian specialized in exotics an other of government entity). Write two lines informing about that is not an incredible effort! Moreover is totally crazy the cost of the call center! You can spend 10€ in few minutes and you can attend very long for an answer. Incredible then is the price I paid for so little animal: 45€ with obligation of economy ticket not refunded.To change my flight was more expensive that the original ticket. I always traveled with Vueling but that was my last time. It's a shame!

### "Never again"
First and last time flying with this airline. Upon booking they advised that we can pay for extra baggage online at a cheaper rate. Tried to do so many times before checking and on same day as flight. After trying to pay multiple times I kept receiving an error from their website. After calling customer care they advised me to pay at checkin at the airport. When we got to the airport they knew the online prices were cheaper without us even explaining anything to them and explained how neither the customer service or check in can do anything about the price. So instead of paying 12 euros online we ended up getting charged 40 euros per baggage which ended up being more expensive than the flight itself. Never again.

### "never again"
Never again and enough for once. Me and my friend had a bad experience with this airlines. We had bought return tickets from Rome to London on 29 December 2017 at 6.35pm. We have tried to check in online twice, but there was a problem when we entered our details. Thus, we were advised by the system to check in on the counter. Upon check in on the counter, we were told by the ground staff that our seats were not confirmed as we only bought the flight tickets, not the seats. The flight was overbooked. So, no seats for us in the flight since we did not check in online. As a result, we were put on the standby list. It sounds ridiculous as the booking was confirmed. What are we paying for if not for the seats? We were also being told by the staff that it such a normal practice for the airlines to sell the overbooked tickets. Then, we were giving the options either to ask for refund or fly in the next flight to London via Barcelona at a later time. Since, everything was planned we chose the second option although we have to burn our hotel for the first night at London and the train ticket to Leeds in the next morning. Further, we were also made to understand by the ground staff that the airline will provide us a transit hotel in Barcelona. However, upon arrival at Barcelona, we found out that there was no one from the airline staff to assist us on the transit hotel. The customer service was not available and the Vueling counter at the airport also closed. Such a worse experience and we end up sleeping at the airport until our flight to London at 7.45am in the next morning. This was one part. The other part was we were informed that we could claim for Euro 250 each as a compensation. As of now, we have not received any compensation from the airline. Based on the email reply, it will only take few days to receive the compensation for the loss suffered. It seems too many lies with this airlines company. To sum up, this will be the first and the last time for us to fly with this airline. I will also not recommend the same to others.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Bilbao to Gatwick. The worst airline ever,  save yourself money and a big headache! After being seated on the plane they announced to leave the plane and pick up our luggage. They did not give us any reasons, we had no idea what was going on. After picking up our luggage, we tried to talk to the "Customer Service" counter who very rudely told us the flight was rescheduled for the next day in the afternoon. We happen to have a connection to Australia the next day so the rescheduled time would not work out for us. We asked for a refund but apparently it can only be done online. We tried to lodge it on line and the web site does not work it takes you out of the site. I asked other people around and this is a sort of common problem with this airline no one has ever got a refund from this unprofessional company.

### "no suitcase or follow up"
I'm on vacation and flew Vueling on January 5th from Paris to Palermo with a connection in Barcelona. Unfortunately, the Vueling representative didn't put a baggage tag on my checked in suitcase. My suitcase was left behind in Paris (confirmed by Vueling) - Vueling sent my suitcase to Palermo (for delivery to me in Ortigia, Sicily) - I called the airport daily to find out the status of my suitcase - Palermo airport told me on January 11th, that my suitcase was given to a courier for delivery. I called daily after that to inquire about the courier's whereabouts. After hearing lie and misleading information numerous days in a row, the airport finally admitted they had no way to follow-up with the courier - I called Vueling on January 17th and they advised that my case was closed because the courier told them they had delivered my suitcase. I told Vueling the delivery did not happen. They responded that they would follow up with the courier and open a police report. It is now 16 days later and no suitcase or follow up from Vueling. I'm basically on my own!

### "customer service is extremely bad"
Madrid to Paris. The worst experience I’ve had with a low cost airline. They saythat you can change your ticket 2hrs prior your flight, but it is impossible to contact them. I ended up having to buy a new ticket and when I explained my situation I did not get a refund back, I had to spend more money and their excuse was that they have been compliant at all times. Phone not working, it hangs up by itself when you call, ridiculous call center hours, no contact email to change flight or online chat available. The customer service is extremely bad.

### "change its on-board announcements"
Cardiff to Malaga. As soon as the flight announcement said that flight-mode devices could be used, the sound-track of a programme blared out (music & American voices). I asked the passing staffif it was a piped radio programme; she replied that three young women a few aisles in front were watching a Kardashian programme on their laptop. I asked her if she could ask them to turn it down or to wear headphones. She asked them meekly to turn the sound down. They ignored her, so I asked her two more times. One of the women turned to stare at me smiling, while they carried on watching with the sound up. One of the trio later shouted abuse at a passenger behind her because he had accidentally pulled her pony-tail as he tried to sit back down. The staff failed to notice. To avoid noise-invasion and bad behaviour Vueling needs to change its on-board announcements to say that if passengers wish to listen to music / watch a DVD, to do so with headphones only, and to train staff to deal with noise-nuisance and abusive behaviour.

### "the worst of all low cost airlines"
Was my first flight with Vueling from Paris CDG to London Gatwick. Flew almost every low cost Airline in Europe. Vueling is regarding the seats and legroom the worst of all low cost airlines. The whole aircraft was smelling like a toilet. The temperature in cabin was so hot we couldn’t breath. I mentioned that to the cabin crew but they were not interested. They did no service at all. All PA announcements were made in the Spanish language even the automatic announcements. There was not a single Spanish person on board. I can only advise. If you have the opportunity stay away from this airline. Was my worst flight so far also because of the French passengers. A real nightmare in the morning. Even Ryanair is better then them. Easyjet is like a premium airline compared to them.

### "original flight was cancelled"
Nice to Barcelona. Firstly our original flight was cancelled, then the flight the next day was delayed and finally they damaged my luggage beyond repair. I reported it  at Barcelona Airport and spent a lot of time filling in forms correctly. Was advised by assistant at counter Vueling would bring me replacement luggage to address I was staying at. Of course nobody made contact. As I was under the impression I lodged my claim I continued with my holiday but had to buy another case. When i got back to South Africa I followed up and told I had 7 days to lodge a claim and its too late now and they refuse to accept my claim even though I supplied the paperwork that clearly shows the date i completed the forms at Barcelona airport?

### "already have 50 minutes dela"
We are on the plane which was supposed to fly at 10:10 from Rome to Amsterdam. We already have 50 minutes delay and we still stay here without any information. The most rude staff we have ever met these staff are really unprofessional. There is excuse for this situation. The most tragic experience we had.

### "Vueling denied my trip"
On November 13, 2017 I should fly from London to Paris. But Vueling denied my trip, no communication, very poor service. I bought a new ticket from Royal Air Morocco and requested Vueling to refund my ticket but Vueling refused to refund me. I realized that Vueling is  very poor customer service, very irresponsible. Vueling office is in Barcelona and deceive the customers. Please be extra careful when you buy your ticket.

### "made a very good impression on me"
Stockholm to Barcelona. Vueling Airlines made a very good impression on me. Both flight legs departed and arrived on time, the cabin staff was really friendly and helpful and they seemed to be happy with their work, and the airplanes were clean. I was pleasantly surprised by the legroom, which was quite a lot; this is probably due to the thinner seat backs that they use. Meals were provided for a price, and these were quite decent meals for the price. All in all, Vueling felt like a proper airline where the price of the ticket is kept low by keeping some services optional, like the meals, which is how low-cost should feel like. I will fly them again if given the option.

### "Cabin crew could not care less"
Flew Vueling from Amsterdam to London Luton. 1 hour delay for a start as plane was late from previous flight. Paid for priority boarding but the lane was closed and had to wait in line only to be told that bag has to go in hold even though priorty seats have allocated space reserved. Cabin crew could not care less about my complaint. Very dismissive and nonchalant. As soon as takeoff was over the hid behind the drubby curtain and kept peering in to the cabin. All in all worse than sleazyjet which is hard thing to accomplish. Do not pay extra for seat. Not worth it! Even better fly with someone else.

### "system did not accept the claim"
The flight from Rome Fiumicino to Nice on 19 November 2017 which was scheduled to depart at 14.50 was cancelled and the customers were informed at 13.34 by email. I alrady contacted the customer service counter at the FCO airport and they suggested 2 options:  offer a hotel and the next flight of Vueling which will depart the next day in the same time or offer a refund and 250Euro compensation. I chose the refund because I needed to travel on that day so I needed to book my travel tickets with different operators. The customer service staffs told me to claim for the refund on Vueling.com and I did it at FCO airport on my mobile phone. It turned out that I couldn’t apply for the refund because the system said I entered the wrong details though everything was right. I queued for the query again and the staffs answered that “you can’t do in on your phone, you need to do it on Computer or tablet and you have 7 days so no rush”. I asked again that whether they are sure that it was systematic problem and they answered “yes”. On the 21 November 2017, I tried to enter all of my details in the claim again on iPad,  but it turned out the same as what happened when I tried to do it on iPhone. The system didn’t accept the claim because some fields of the answers are incorrect while yes again every information I filled is correct according to the detail I got on my email address regarding my booking number, my flight number and the origin and destination. Until today, 24 November 2017 , I tried to claim for my refund and compensation again on Computer, google chrome is my browser. The system did not accept the claim and 7 days almost run out. The system should be better in order to serve customers. The answer of the staff is just the ignorance. I write this review in order to warn the customers that please consider this factor before choosing to fly with Vueling. I can’t accept this irresponsibility and I need my money, including the compensation that I’m entitled to back. I can’t find the way to claim it except this because every time I tried to fill in my correct information, the system just deny it.

### "I would never use them again"
We flew from Dubrovonik to Palermo, Sicily and when we arrived our two bags did not arrive on the plane. After speaking to the baggage claims area we were given a case and reference number, we were told that if our bags did not arrive within 24 hours then we could spend 100Euro per person per day that our luggage was missing to buy essential clothes and toiletries (this was given to us in writing). We were told this would be claimed through Vueling Airlines and to keep all receipts. We never took advantage of this full amount and only purchased essential items and clothing for the remainder of our trip. After 24 hours and many phone calls our bags still had not arrived. As we had no toiletries or clothes we purchased only essential items that day. As each day passed and we did not receive our bags and in fact were never contacted (we had to ring numerous times each day) we purchased a small amount of items each day, always hoping our luggage would turn up. After 6 days of no luggage we were departing Europe to return home. One bag finally arrived on the final day (after 6 days) however the other bag never arrived. During the time we had no luggage we kept receipts for the essential clothing and amenities we required (this was under the 100 Euro per person per day that we were told we could claim). The missing bag was finally delivered to Australia 10 days after being lost and was NOT sent to our home instead we had to go to the airport to pick it up as we were told Vueling would not do so. Throughout this entire saga Vueling would not reply to any emails, phone calls etc. I then sent through all of the documentation required, boarding passes, receipts, case claim details etc. and sent them to Vueling. Without any explanation we received a refund of $500AUD for both bags that had gone missing (1 for 6 days and 1 for 10 days). The customer service with Vueling is disgusting. I have asked for explanations about the amount of refund and after being ignored for months received an email with their terms and conditions (which we were completely within). I sent an email showing that we in fact fell completely within their guidelines and after another month received a response saying “we regret to inform you that once again we cannot give you a favorable answer due to the reasons we stated in our last communication.” I have spoken to many people about this disgraceful service and have been told by so many that they are known for always losing baggage and their appalling customer service. I would never use them again and would encourage others to avoid them if they did not want their holiday ruined by their shocking behaviour towards their clients. It is not a value for money airline as by the time you have to buy new clothes etc for the luggage they lose it becomes more expensive than most other internal European airlines

### "This company is a joke"
Flew San Sebastian to Barcelona. I've flown with Vueling twice in my life and it was the worst experience I've ever had with any airline. The first time I was moving countries. My first flight, with Vueling too, was delayed so I didn't make it for the next. Vueling put me on a flight to another city nearby and lost my bag for 6 days. I had to buy a few things that Vueling never gave me money back for, claiming they haven't done anything wrong. Today I'm supposed to fly with Vueling again and I regret not taking a 6h train because it would have been so much faster and less stressful. Last night I got a message that due to runway surfacing work Vueling had to reduce the capacity of planes and not all passengers will be able to take the flight. I'm sure the airport had planned the renovations long before but Vueling kept selling tickets just to tell passengers the night before that 'first comes, first served' so you better rush to the airport at 6am, otherwise you won't be allowed to take the flight. I wake up at 5.30am just to receive another message from Vueling informing me that the flight is 4.5 hours delayed but the check in time hasn't changed. So I rush to the airport because I want to be one of those lucky people taking that terribly delayed flight. I checked in at 7am, 7.5h before the flight will take off. Vueling graced me with complementary breakfast: a croissant and a coffee. For over 7h of waiting. I want to make it official: I'll never fly with Vueling again. This company is a joke.

### "really satisfied with the flight"
Zurich to Malaga. We travelled in a group of 19 students on a trip to Malaga. We had some hesitations booking them initially, especially after their disruptions during Summer 2016. However as soon as we got to the airport, we were pleased to find an organised check-in which completed the process within ten minutes. Flight boarded on-time and we left just slightly behind schedule. The aircraft was two years old, but unfortunately the seats already looked a bit worn-out, which was a contrast to the modern cabin. The crew were efficient and friendly. The in-flight menu had great choices although it was rather pricey. The flight landed on-time and the baggage was delivered promptly. In conclusion we were really satisfied with the flight especially for the price paid.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Munich to Barcelona. Vueling is one of the worst airlines I’ve encountered, and I travel very regularly. They locked the access to my account and never unlocked it “after 30 minutes” and the only way to access it was to actually call their customer service, which you pay for. Their “miles” offer is buggy, you can’t actually apply a flight to your account for X different reasons so they avoid giving you miles. I had to give up each time, and I flew multiple times with them. I think this bad ergonomy it’s totally voluntary. Then I had another flight where their site blew in the middle of the actual credit card transaction. Impossible to recover my reservation, I had to call again, pay for it, and they dared to tell me to go to the airport to pay again there with the same reservation rather than solving the problem. I’ll now avoid this company at any price.

### "no communication and avoiding responsibility"
Vueling Airlines flight to Luton had to be stopped midway and return to Amsterdam due to brake problems. After waiting for a replacement plane for an hour, passengers were requested to return to the Vueling counter at the Arrivals hall where hotel tickets and a flight ticket for the next morning would be waiting for us. After the long wait at Passport control, 180 tired passengers arrived at the counter only to find that there was no one there. A few people tried the contact number left behind the counter but there was no answer. Several families had young kids who were exhausted. Tempers started running high and the airport police needed to intervene. It’s amazing that an airline company can operate like this - no communication and avoiding responsibility! Extremely disappointing!

### "I found it quite acceptable"
Venice to Manchester via Barcelona. I did not book with this airline, it was in lieu of original booking with Monarch. On the whole I found it quite acceptable. The aircraft was clean and looked well maintained, The seats were rather more comfortable than they looked, and even for my 5ft 11in the legroom was adequate. Two difficulties were that the departure from Venice was some 30 mins late and no explanation given ("Sorry for the delay" is neither an excuse nor a reason, however heartfelt it is said) Also if you are giving announcements in English with a strong Spanish accent, you stand a better chance of being understood if you speak slowly , not at native Spanish speed. My big concern is that the cabin staff were very blasé about my concerns that I would not have enough time to change planes in Barcelona as we were somewhat late and refused to contact the gate for the onward flight to confirm I was on my way. As it happened I made it, but it was an anxious half-hour or so

### "there was zero communication"
Horrible airline. Midflight the captain said a single sentence “We can't land in London, we are turning back around to Amsterdam.” This was followed by complete radio silence after we flew back, save for some automated messages (put on your seatbelts, etc). After we landed, there was zero communication on what would happen for hours. Finally, after three hours had passed, they said they were cancelling the flight and moving it to the next morning. After that, we tried to get a hotel for the night, but for hours they were not cooperating and refusing to offer us a place to stay (at midnight already, while there were many people with children present). After hours of arguing and shouting people finally got hotels, and we had to wait for the flight the next morning, except when this flight was supposed to happen was very unclear. They stated 8am, but the e-ticket and website said 10am. I suppose the truth is always in the middle, because the flight left at 9am! Amazing. Horrible airline, horrible communication. Do not use it.

### "would never fly them again"
We were scheduled for a 3:25 flight from Paris to Rome, a 2 hour flight. We arrived at the airport around 12:30, got thru our check in and went to the appropriate gate. 3:25 was getting close and we saw no sign of boarding. Spoke to the attendant he said it's been delayed but we should arrive in Rome at 7:05 pm. I called our car service and informed them of the change. Without any notice from the attendants, our flight did not leave until 8:30 pm. We were never offered any explanation or were not told anything until we enquired. They never made any announcements of the flight delays. After finally boarding after a 5 hour delay, they did go around with water glasses but only offered that to the passengers in the aisle seats. No one else was ever offered any kind of drink. Do not choose Vueling - I would never fly them again.

### "horrible customer service"
Amsterdam to Luton. Vueling Airlines customer "service" has been utterly horrible. They have misinformed me 3 times: I received an email saying the flight has been cancelled, I phoned their customer service to make sure the flight has been canceled. The representative told me the flight was indeed cancelled. When I arrived at the airport, I saw on the information display the flight was only delayed. The Vueling service desk at Luton airport confirmed that there was only delay. However, when I phoned customer service, a representative again said the flight has been canceled. I have been tossed around like a piece of trash, not as a customer. The apologies are worth nothing to me. In fact, the representative already offered me a EUR39,- refund, but had to withdraw that statement too! I'm very patient and generous, but this has been my single worst customer service experience ever. I ended up paying EUR130,- for a ticket with another airline. In plain English, I've been screwed and they have the guts to tell me there is nothing they can do. And now I've received 2 more standard replies, not latching on to my complaint about horrible customer service. It speaks for itself that I will avoid booking via Vueling like the plague and recommend anyone else to do so.

### "Return flight was good"
Cardiff to Barcelona. One of our better experiences with Vueling. Outward flight was delayed by 35 minutes which by Vueling standards is quite normal. Only complaint was that there was no hot water for hot drinks. Return flight was good. Early departure and landing with a newish plane with the thinner style seats which give slightly better leg room. Leg room on Vueling planes is probably the worst of the low cost carriers but is just about OK for flights up to 2 or 3 hours.

### "no apologies or explanations"
Barcelona to Amsterdam. Almost 3h delay on the way to Barcelona. For now already 2h of delay for the return to Amsterdam. We got stuck 1 hour on the ground in Amsterdam after already 2h waiting in the airport. No food was provided for free. And worst: there was not enough food (to pay) for the passengers in the plane. Absolutely no compensation. That’s just not possible. And now the same for the return, waiting with no apologies or explanations for at least 2 more hours

### "Not a fair policy Vueling"
Flew Mahon to Barcelona. Boarding by row number. First 15-31 then 1-14. We were in 5 A and B, very full flight and we only had hand luggage but within the allowed limits. Obviously passengers from 15-31 had left their luggage in the early lockers as they were completely full when we boarded and I was instructed by staff to take them to row 30/31 where there was the only available space. With a close connection to another flight in Barcelona we were most unhappy to have to wait until the entire plane was emptied before we could collect our bags. Surely when cabin crew are stationed all through the plane for boarding this leaving of luggage in the wrong lockers could easily be stopped after all seats 1-14 lockers were all empty when 15 -31 boarded first. Not a fair policy Vueling.

### "I was satisfied with the flight"
Flew Malaga to Palma De Mallorca with Vueling Airlines. The website was easy and functional to use and very informative too. When I checked-in I had a lovely lady assist me. I saw her going the extra mile to help an elderly lady and this set a highly favorable impression. Boarding was logical and quick and the cabin crew were attentive. The flight was just over 1 hour and 30 mins. The staff served to buy snacks and drinks. The plane was clean and tidy and arrived on time into Mallorca. Overall I was satisfied with the flight and will consider using this airline again.

### "service generally is good"
Vueling is the low cost airline from Spain. Service in generally is good and planes are reliable. One plus is the fact that you can checkin as you buy the ticket. What a great idea! On the minus side, frequencies of key routes in Europe are fairly less than some competitors.

### "offered very good value"
Very Good Experience! I flew from London Gatwick to Barcelona yesterday on the 9.45am flight. My other option was a British Airways flight at three times the cost of the Vueling so decided to take a chance and try Vueling (purchased my ticket before reading all the bad reviews on this and other sites - if I had read all these reviews first I would not have taken my flight and would have spent unneeded money and spent uneeded time avoiding what turned out to be a perfectly fine experience). Heres how it went: Check in at Gatwick: long line but efficiently handled (even allowed a tiny bit of overweight in my luggage at no cost or hassle). Posting of departure gate: 20 minutes before gate opened. Boarding: orderly and organized - special needs and "Excellence" customers first, then by section, strictly enforced. Equipment: seemed fairly new, seats dont recline but for a short flight not a big deal (and the person in front of you is not reclining into your lap). Take off: 15min late but smoothly executed. Crew: impeccably groomed, professional but not warm, got their jobs done without flourish but with courtesy. Flight: uneventful - crew will come through cabin to offer for-sale food and drink and due to the time it takes to process payments this can block aisle for a large part of the flight (items offered looked fine, although I brought my own refreshment so didn't try any). Carry-on space - ample for a regulation sized article in overhead and a small bag (briefcase or handbag) under the seat. Landing - on time and as smooth as most I've had (we landed on time because we made up for late take off by faster air speed en route). Safety: very attentive. Thorough demonstration before take off and we experienced what seemed to me a very slight turbulence at times en route, to which the captain and crew insisited we return to seats and fasten belts, halted food/drink service and temporarily shut down toilets. In my experience with other airlines' handling of similar turbulence, I felt this was overly cautious, but I was left with the feeling that they take passenger safety very seriously, a good thing even if I couldnt use the loo for a few minutes longer! Luggage reclaim: everything checked arrived in perfect order within reasonable time after landing. Would I book them again? : yes of course, if the route, time and price still compared favorably to the other options This is a value-based airline, which for the price I paid, offered very good value.

### "Will never fly again "
Vueling flight from San Sebastian to Barcelona was delayed for 2.5 hours, causing us to miss our flight from BCN to NYC. My wife and I had to pay $600+ for rebooking fees and hotel. Contacted Vueling and all they do is cite regulation stating that they don't have to compensate for delays less than 3 hours. Vueling would not even offer to cover our meals. Will never fly again.

### "A very poor experience"
Gatwick to Rome. Booked with Vueling via BA. turned up at LGW, queued to check in at Vueling desk to be told tickets hadn't been issued, despite confirmation emails and filling in API info. After 90 minutes discovered it was a BA glitch. Flight 60 mins late leaving, seat on row 3 had plenty of room, but i think this was an extra legroom seat that we hadn't paid for. Flight back from Rome was pretty bad, and 90 minutes late leaving. As we'd sat at the gate for a long time we needed a snack on the plane, and looking at the picture of a Cheese, pesto and sun dried tomato focaccia we paid our 6.5 Euros looking forward to something tasty. Big mistake! Tiny pieces of cheese a wipe of pesto and some minute tomato's. I complained to the female crew member and her reply was that it wasn't her fault as she hadn't made it. A pretty grubby aircraft didn't help. A very poor experience.

### "avoid to fly with Vueling"
Rome to Zurich. 3 month before our flight I booked it via internet and I was confirmed to fly with Iberia (but it was Vueling Airlines). We checked in and was told that they have no seats for us but one is left so one can fly to Zurich and the other one to Barcelona? What an offer. Finally they called the police because we did not agree and wanted to fly from Rome and then we where forced to fly to Barcelona. No Hotel and any help was offered in Barcelona. Then we looked for our luggage and we didn't found it so we went to the Lost and Found counter. There they try to tell us that we have to go to another belt but only luggage from Dusseldorf arrived! When we when't back to the counter he replied that he can not see in the system that a suitcase is missing. After finally found a hotel we went to sleep at 2 AM and the flight to Zurich was at 7 AM, not long sleep after all that stress. Then another delay again and we took off about 2 hours later. In Zurich again trouble to find our suitcase and they where not helpful at all. Only 2 days later we got our suitcase. We strongly recommend to avoid to fly with Vueling. Ones you have a problem they not help you at all and you have to look for yourself.

### "I've been sitting here for over an hour"
My Vueling Airlines flight from Amsterdam to London Luton has been delayed originally with 1 hour, then we finally got on the plane which just didn't depart. I've been sitting here for over an hour and it still didn't leave. The reason being is that they haven't got permission yet to depart. Ill never fly with this airline again, very disappointed.

### "Last time I travel with Vueling"
Milano to Barcelona, the flight was late. We arrived in Barcelona with one hour and a half late and it's not the first time. It happened to us every time we took this flight from Milan to Barcelona. Due to the delay we missed the last metro and we had to go by bus under the rain! Last time I travel with Vueling for sure.

### "filthy banged up A320"
Rome to Paris Orly return. I had two wildly differing experiences in and out of Paris Orly on Vueling. Inbound was satisfactory, being it left on time and was relatively comfortable. It was an A321 which seemed newish, even if it was a bit grubby. I was hungry and was one of the few people who opted for any service, and had a "hot sandwich". No-one would be suprised to hear it was expensive and disgusting. Nor was it hot. Lesson learned. Outbound back to FCO was completely different. En route to airport received text advising delay of 80 minutes. I had already wrapped up everything for the day, but yet to get on the train to Orly so spent some time over a slightly longer lunch. When I got to Orly, boards said it was all on time but I continued to get text messages which had pushed out departure further which was confusing. Boards were updated eventually but different to my text advice. Stated boarding time cand went, by now everyone was in a queue waiting to board and we were now running about 2.5 hours late. Boarding started but then we were kept standing in the airbridge for about 45 minutes. Then we were all sent back to terminal, as there was a technical fault with plane, to await further instructions. An hour or so of confusion ensued. Vueling team on the ground seemed as bewildered as the passengers, and just looked like they wanted us all to go away. I got text updates for 8PM departure. By 8 clock we were still in terminal. Around 8.30 we boarded again. We then sat on the plane until 9.30 and finally left. The plane was dreadful - a filthy banged up A320. Flaking paint, dirty side panels, sticky windows, grubby tray tables, chewing gum stuck in the carpet. Very tight seating. Crew arrogant and lazy. The two male crew were particularly unpleasant. Flew the trolley down the aisle avoiding eye contact. I was suprised that with a five hour delay they didn't even attempt to placate passengers with a glass of water or anything. We got to FCO 5 hours behind schedule.

### "his bag alone was missing"
Barcelona to Dublin. Due to adverse weather conditions in the U.S, my son (22) and friends were re- routed from Charlotte to Barcelona with American Airlines on 24/8 and then on to Dublin with Vueling on 25/8, flight VY8720. On arrival in Dublin, his bag alone was missing and he reported the matter to Vueling's ground handling agent, Swissport, who filed a report etc. To date and despite almost daily contact our end, neither Vuleing nor their agent can locate his bag which contains most of his possessions. American Airlines has confirmed that his bag was delivered to Barcelona at which point Vueling as final carrier, assumed responsibility. It is impossible to contact Vueling directly and the number given on their website appears to be a baggage hall. A recent email to the delayed baggage address on the Vueling website returned a reply asking for the provision of receipts for the missing clothes and bag, most of which were purchased months ago and in the case of his bag, some years ago. At this point we have to assume that the bag and contents are lost, and while the matter of restitution rests clearly with Vueling, we conclude that they have no intention of fulfilling that obligation.

### "An airline to avoid"
We booked Vueling from Mahon to Barcelona and Monarch from Barcelona to Gatwick. We had had 1.5 hrs to go from one terminal to another in Barcelona, we had no luggage. Problem started when the Vueling flight was delayed, no one at airline info desk could give us any information, no announcements made, so we sat and waited then we saw another Vueling flight going to Barcelona, we were told no chance of getting on that flight however we noticed people who were in our original queue boarding this plane. A Singaporian doctor suggested that Spanish speakers were given priority. After making enquiries as to how long we were going to be stranded as it was now over two hours with no news, we were still told no information. Met the doctor again waving a form at me "get one of these and demand it is stamped to get the compensation as per EU law also get your food vouchers" this is what we did. Had we not been advised what to do by this kind lady then we wouldn't have known what to do. Eventually we were put on a later flight but missed our connection to Gatwick. Could have caught a Norwegian flight at a cost of EU460 each, no way so we stayed at a hotel and flew Norwegian the next day for EU270 each. The Veuling staff were courteous but offered no assistance, tried to contact Monarch but no numbers answered, no help lines so they were of no use. Vueling were hopeless and just couldn't be bothered to inform us of anything. An airline to avoid, cheaper but unreliable. We came back by Norwegian, wonderful airline with comfortable seats and super food, now our preferred airline.

### "Poorly organised onboard"
Florence to Gatwick. Awful flight. Delayed, with little and late information. Poorly organised onboard and rude cabin crew. Missed drinks and snacks. This caused us to arrive very late, missing a night out on my wife's birthday. Seats are tiny and plane seemed old?. They also seemed to let people on with a lot of luggage, meaning that we had to stow ours a long way from where we were sitting (which in turn caused a delay when exiting the plane). The worst flight I've had in years and not cheap.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Valencia to Brussels. First time travelling with this airline. It will be the last time I travel with them too. I arrived at the airport two hours before departure of the flight only to know that the flight was already delayed 3 hours. I was supposed to arrive in Brussels at 20:40, well at that time I was only boarding. The last train home was at 23:10, of course with that big delay I missed the last train and was forced to take a taxi which was 100 euros. I expressed my concerns to the airline and I asked if there was any kind of compensation. Well the people at information told me that I could try to get a refund for the taxi but I would not get it because they promise was to take me to Brussels, it doesn't matter that it was 3 hours later. I do not recommend this airline, trying to save some money I ended up spending even more.

### "totally value for money"
After all the bad reviews I was rather concerned with flying to Florence with Vueling but I have to admit both outbound and inbound flight were on time, smooth (first leg had some bad weather on the way) and totally value for money. I will fly again with them to Spain soon and I am now looking forward my next trip. Of course it's a low cost flight but I appreciated the extra piece of hand luggage allowed. All drinks/food are extra and there is a good choice of both. Inside magazine is nice to read both in English and Spanish.

### "the most cramped, uncomfortable, seating"
Flew Vueling from Santiago de Compostela to London Gatwick. For anyone taller than six foot, expect the most cramped, uncomfortable, seating legally permitted. Legroom is painfully restricted. Pay more for seating with a few extra inches of space. Or better yet, pay more to fly with an airline that treats their customers with a little more consideration and respect.

### "I'd had enough of Vueling"
San Sebastián to Brest via Barcelona. Vueling re-routed our flight via Bilbao, but while this delayed our arrival in Barcelona by 2 hours, we still arrived in time for my flight to Brest. However as we were boarding my boarding pass set off a a red light at the scanner. Vueling staff said I couldn't board as I was not on their scheduled passenger list. I showed them my flight booking confirmation etc but no amount of pleading would they help or allow me to board. I was told to go to the transfer desk to get another flight. The queue at the transfer desk involved a 45min wait as there was only one staff member. There I was told they couldn't help and that I needed to go to the Vueling ticketing office outside the secure area of the airport and that it wasn't clear where my checked-in bag was. I went to the baggage area and queued for 20mins after looking for my bags. They didn't know and just said to come back later! I went to ticketing and queued for another 30mins - all this time knowing I was missing chances to board other flights but again Vueling had ridiculously low numbers of staff to assist. At ticketing they said I couldn't fly to Brest for 4 days, that I'd have to wait in Barcelona at my own expense for 4 days to fly. I was only going to Brest for 4 days so that was pointless. So I asked if I could fly to Nantes instead and then catch a bus to Brest. Yes was the answer. OK. So re-ticketed to Nantes I went back through airport security to the luggage counter to make sure my bags would be loaded on the Nantes flight. Another 30 minutes wait. They hadn't found my luggage but as the Nantes flight wasn't leaving for 4 hours there was time to find and load my bag. Wait 4 hours. Flight delayed for Nantes another 2 hours. OK wait again and at around midnight we finally board. But after boarding we wait on the tarmac for 20mins. Then the announcement that because we took too long to board the plane Vueling had lost their take-off allocation so we had to disembark. By now it was close to 1am. I'd been up since 5am to catch my first flight from San Sebastián. Back in the terminal Vueling's communication was appalling. Rather than make a group announcement, everyone was expected to queue at the transfer desk to be told individually what was happening! After standing around for another 45mins of total confusion we were told the next flight would be at 6.30am. We could go to a hotel for 3 hours or sit in the airport overnight. They gave us a voucher for a snack at a very ordinary cafe. The bad communication continued and as I'd already lost one day of a 4 day trip to Brest and would lose another day trying to get to Brest via Nantes, I decided to cut my losses and give up on getting to Brest and asked if I could go to Madrid instead. Yes, but not until 9.30pm that night! I couldn't cope with another 20 hours at Barcelona airport so asked for a refund. OK I could get a refund but I wouldn't get the money back for up to a month. Fine, I'd had enough of Vueling. Then I went to get my bags. Vueling couldn't find them. I waited two hours until 5am. Desperate to rest I got a train to Madrid and Vueling promised to deliver my bag to me asap in Madrid. It's now been more than 35 hours and Vueling still hasn't got my bag to me nor can they tell me when I'll get my bag!

### "Horrible Vueling Airlines"
Barcelona to Lisbon. The flight departure was scheduled at 18:40 hrs originally. It is now 21:40pm and there is no sign of the co-pilot which is the cause of the delay. The worst is that there is no information as to when we can leave or what is the plan of action. We have been waiting in the aircraft patiently for the last 2 hrs without any food etc. There is also a medical emergency that has taken place on the flight. It is just sad that due to a pilot not showing up we are expected to wait endlessly and there is no backup plan. We had to change our reservation details in the destination city as well. Never been on an unprofessional flight like this. The airline should compensate the passengers in some way. In the airplane and still waiting for intimation from the team as to when we are expected to depart. If only they had not let us board the flight, atleast we could have been at the airport with easy access to other facilities. Horrible Vueling Airlines.

### "Lessons learnt from a missed connection"
Lessons learnt from a missed connection with Vueling. When I booked our trip from Venice to Seville on Vueling I wasn't worried that we had a 2.5 stopover in Barcelona, even though we were changing countries we were within the Schengen region so would only need to clear security (and this was before the new security screening procedures were introduced). Shortly before we left for the airport Tripit sent me a message saying the flight had been delayed, even though, according to the Vueling app it wasn't. Even when we checked in there was no mention of a delay. Long story short we ended up leaving over two hours late (which means we are entitled to 400 euro compensation each - good old EU). Of course we missed our connection (not by much though - if they'd had somebody waiting to rush us through to the gate we would have made it). There we no flights to Seville that night so Vueling said they would give us vouchers for dinner and a hotel. Ok, we thought, this has turned out to have a silver lining after all, as it was only 9pm we'd get to spend Saturday night in Barcelona - how bad can that be? Very, very bad as it turned out! As we had no checked baggage we were at the front of the 'passengers with incidents' queue where we were given our vouchers. Dinner was to be at the most basic of airport cafes (no alcohol of course) and we had to wait until 11.30 to get the bus to the hotel. Barcelona is a hub for Vueling so most of the people on the Venice flight had also missed connecting flights. There ended up being a full bus load of us. We decided not to wait and take a taxi at our expense to the hotel, the taxi driver had never heard of the hotel and when he looked it up on Google said "it's not even in Barcelona. I'm not sure how much it will cost but it will be at least 80 Euro" Gulp. Back to plan A. We got to the area where the bus was supposed to be and waited, and waited. Naturally nobody from Iberia or Vueling fronted up to let us know what was happening. We left sometime after midnight and drove for at least an hour to a hotel in the middle of nowhere. We finally made it to bed around 2am. The only bus back to the airport left at 5am! What would I do differently? I would collect my new flight booking and boarding pass and say no thanks to the offer of dinner and hotel room. I'd take a taxi to downtown and choose my own hotel and restaurant and have a memorably pleasant evening. I could afford to do this with the 400 euro compensation that I'd be getting from Vueling.

### "Low cost is a joke"
Flew Vueling from Bucharest to Barcelona. I booked an EXCELLENCE class ticket with this airline, nobody from cabin crew team offered a smile at least, even though my ticket was confirmed on 1A seat with meal. What totally ruined my day was not the unfriendly cabin crew, but I missed the connection flight to Vigo because of a critical delay on the first flight, Bucharest to Barcelona. Low cost is a joke. It was, on contrary, very expensive. Many thanks to the nice lady at airport staff who helped me to reroute.

### "Least legroom I have had"
Olbia to Barcelona. Horrendous. Least legroom I have had on any airline and I have flown with a lot. Awful customer service. Will never fly with again and would not recommend. Air hostess was very unhelpful . I got to the check In desk 3.5 hrs before the flight as online check in was not possible

### "Customer service is lacking"
I am a frequent flyer having flown different airlines including budget ones but this airline is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to on time services. Flight was on time when checked online prior to arrival to the airport. Customer Service at airport said it was unable to confirm on time or not because it was just over 2 hours prior to flying. Within 15 mins of due boarding indicator board stated delay of 20 then 30 then 45 minutes, all within 10 minute! Yes budget but seriously this is 2017 and for delays like this is unacceptable. What about those with connecting flights? Customer service is lacking. Jetstar Australia and Tiger Air can show you how its done. Same experience flying Barcelona to Palma delayed without advice until at the boarding gate waiting to board. Never again will I fly with them. I'd rather sail from Barcelona to Ibiza or Palma.

### "a 2 hour grievance policy"
We booked a trip from Geneva to Barcelona and when I received the confirmation email (which showed only one passenger, not two), it showed we had bought tickets for Lyon to Barcelona. I phoned but the lines were closed so I left an email explaining the situation. The next morning I phoned and the lady refused to help me. She said she could not change the tickets or refund the money. We asked for a manager or some sort of help as we were both students traveling on a budget but she said she could not help us. I explained this was the airlines fault but she just repeated she could not help us. We phoned back several times until we got a new representative and the same scenario played out. Finally after we got him to understand our situation he told us they had a 2 hour grievance policy. The email never stated this nor did the website make any reference to this. This made us aware that they could change the flight and they just did not want to help us because they wanted our money. I explained again, after several attempts, that we emailed them immediately after we received the wrong tickets. He looked up my email and finally accepted to refund our money. No apologies for their mistakes and I am still waiting on my money to be refunded. I am appalled that an airline would not change the mistake they made and how unhelpful their "customer service" was. I am grateful they finally gave me a refund but I still do not understand why it took so much push from my end. What are two students traveling on a budget suppose to do with tickets from Lyon when they are in Geneva?

### "seat pockets were filled with old garbage"
Flew from Prague to Paris. Flying with Vueling on that particular route was like flying in a garbage bin. On our way to Prague I noticed that the seats were from an older aircraft and that the floors were not vacuumed properly, the seat in front of me had a red wine stain and the water in the bathroom was stagnant and wouldn't flush. On our way back, our seat pockets were filled with old garbage (several gums, wrapping papers and something smelly). It made me nervous as I sat there and thought about what else were they neglecting. The flight attendants were doing their jobs, even though it felt like they were disorganized, and on both flight had to lunch and dine first, so there was a bit of a wait for the customers. They had trouble picking up the carnage before landing as there was little time left for it. Not a pleasant experience. Wouldn't recommend that route. Both Iberia and Vueling Airlines bookings end up on the same plane.

### "airline does not seem to care"
Rome to Split. My wife, and couple family members, and myself were on a very short flight from Rome to Split. The flight was very short and simple, but as the pilot checks the fuel, tire pressure and other things needed for the plane to take off properly, nobody thought it was important enough to make sure all bags were on board. When we all arrived in Split the baggage handler said they plane is empty and no more bags. I thought he was joking since there was about 50 people still waiting for their bags. The airline never stepped up and contacted us in the time they said nor did they act as if this was an inconvenience for is who so not have our bags. We have been in split for 2 days without our bags and the airline has not completed the task we paid for. This is 2017 and how an airline could let any of their employees to let this happen to so many bags is very unprofessional. Someone needs to step up and take accountability for the hardship they caused the paying customers of their airline. This airline does not seem to care that people work hard for their money and pays a high price for a nice vacation that can all be ruined. I only give a 1 because the system won't let me leave anything less!

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Manchester to Tenerife South. After the bad reviews I had read I was pleasantly surprised. We checked in within 10 minutes unfortunately my pre booked seats he been allocated to other passengers however we were still seated together and were happy with that, I was told at the desk to make a claim for the cost of the seats I have put the claim in so will see if I get the refund. No queues at boarding straight through no problens. The flight was on time, cabin staff polite and friendly and upon leaving the plane all bags were collected with no more than a 15 minute wait. All in all an easy, comfortable and pleasurable experience which was great as it was my youngest sons first time flying and he has many health and development issues and he was fine and loved it. No kids snack packs available which was a bit annoying but managed fine.

### "plane left without us"
Barcelona to Brussels. Horrible. We arrived at the check in counter an hour prior to our departure, due to the long line and slow service. The agent at the counter took 20-25 mins to check us in and would not explain what was going on. Finally she explained that the flight was closed but she managed to get us on. We received our boarding passes and rushed to board the plane, receiving no compassion or help from the Vueling agents to rush through security lines. Arrived at the gate only to find that the plane left without us. My luggage was sent on the plane without me, and 3 days later I still haven't received any news. This caused us to miss our next flight home, costing us the purchase of a new flight. Vueling has not done anything to compensate us.

### "budget airline of course"
Gatwick to Barcelona. When I booked my Barcelona holiday on Vueling, I haven't heard of this airline before then I read all the negative reviews but too late for that I paid already. I think if you are flexible with your time this airline is ok. They're delayed and I experienced that both of my trips with them, an hour is not much I suppose. It's a budget airline of course not much to expect. If you want a proper service book to the major airlines.

### "never again with Vueling"
Rome to Barcelona. Overpriced, overcrowded, late, no service, no communication or explanation. Late leaving, late landing, waited 35 minutes for luggage. Frequent traveler (twice yearly to Europe) first and only time and never again with Vueling.

### "excellent flight with Vueling"
Paris Orly to Palma de Mallorca. This flight was part of a group reservation. I did the contacts with the company for every step in our booking. I was impressed by the quality and the assistance offered. I have to say that I had my fears based in my prior experiences flying alone, but on this case I have to score them with the maximum punctuation. The flight was very good, we embarked with 20’ delay due to late arrival of the plane from Ibiza, but we recovered time on flight and we arrived on time to Palma. A new A321 configured with the new seats has proper space for legs including travelling in the last rows. Service during the flight was good, flight attendants doing a very good job. Vueling has no free service, so food and refreshments have to be paid. Checking and control at Orly airport was smooth. The worst is the hall 1 of the airport, really small for such big number of flights departing from this area that make a mess the boarding. Impossible to understand what the personal said through the speakers because the bad quality of the sound, but this is a problem of the airport and not of Vueling. All in all an excellent flight with Vueling.

### "they were extremely rude"
I had a reservation with Vueling for me and my wife, Lisbon to Zürich on 1st August. Because we acquired the tickets a few months before, we also bought the extra flexfly service, which allows you to change the flight without the extra charge. On the 29 July I tried to change my flight online, while keeping the original flight for my wife. On the website it's possible to change, but after I selected the date the flight was immediately changed for the 2 passengers. No confirmation was asked. I called Vueling to undo this change. They refused to undo the changes, and asked for 300 euros per passenger to book it back to the original. This was 5 minutes later after, and they asked for 600 euros to book it back to the original. I asked to speak with the manager, and was told she has no time. My wife call again one hour later, and again they were extremely rude, and the manager was also not available to speak. I had to other alternative than buying another ticket for my wife, for different dates and on very short notice. Vueling should be ashamed of the way they treat customers. I will never buy another ticket with Vueling!

### "Both flights were delayed"
This is one of the worst, if not the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Flew from Madrid to Lebanon via Barcelona. Both flights were delayed, I barely had time to make it to the second one. They have no blankets onboard and they do not offer food for a 4 hour flight, not even snacks and there is no entertainement. On top of all that, they lost my suitcase. It's been more than 48 hours that they are unable to track it. Never again Vueling.

### "it's a nice low cost"
Amsterdam to Barcelona. So everything starts in the airport. The flight was delayed by half an hour, not so bad but still annoying. The aircraft was pretty clean, and I was allowed to visit the cockpit (very nice crew). The flight was pretty short, but the crew served hot meals. I bought the Yatekomo (however it's called) noodles and it was fantastic. I recommend Vueling because it's a nice low cost that gives you what you need at pretty good prices, the cabin crew was very very nice and the prices on board were pretty cheap.

### "the flight was cancelled"
I was supposed to take a flight from Gatwick to Barcelona July 17 at 14:40. The flight was cancelled, and after hours standing in line and waiting we were transported by bus to London Heathrow airport as we were told we would take a flight from there instead. After another 5-6 hours standing in a line waiting, we were told that there would be no flight anyway. About 400 passengers were affected and the little information they gave out were given only to a few person face to face (no public announcement that everyone could hear). Total chaos. Total uncertainty. No food vouchers were given out and we were not offered hotel vouchers. No new flight information were given by e-mail or verbally this day nor the next day. My phone didn't work in England and eventually in the evening July 18 a kind airport service person at Heathrow lent me her phone, making me able to arrange for a new flight to Barcelona. Having arrived in Barcelona (not my final destination) I got stranded again as I had to buy a new flight to my final destination. After a roundtrip Europe-Canada, with extra expenses in London not in the travel budget - I had run out of money. No help from Vueling. I will never travel with this airline again as you risk doubling the price of your journey if you have a connecting flight you miss or worse end up stranded in a foreign country with no mean of getting home unless you have some extra 3000$ on your travel budget.

### "consistently been misled"
London to Santorini via Rome. Our luggage was lost and we were told for 4 days that it would be delivered to our vacation villa. We waited, not leaving the villa all day for four days and the bags were never delivered. Each day we called Vueling at least once, and most days two times a day to check on delivery time. We leave Santorini tomorrow after waiting another day at the villa for the bags, but have still not received our bags. We have consistently been misled by Vueling staff that repeatedly assured us of delivery times that never happened.

### "stressful, late cramped flight"
Amsterdam to Lisbon. Every time I fly with Vueling I have a late flight, this time was no different. We were offered no explanation, we waited 1 hour in the airport, and another already in the airplane. Because of the wait we got hungry and wanted to buy a sandwich. We were sittig in the middle of the plane and it took 1.5 hours for the crew to get to us. Everytime someone ordered a warm sandwich they would walk to the back to warm it up, one by one. When they got to us there were no sandwiches left. Also the flight is extremely cramped (and I am 1,60 so I can't imagine what taller people go through). The intercoms were had quite a bit of static so the captain and crew were not understandable. I didn't know there could be a worse experience than Ryanair, I was wrong. I might add that this was not a cheap flight 150€ one way to Lisbon. Overall a stressful, late cramped flight.

### "Will never use this airline again"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Prague to Barcelona. Terrible airline. We were able to board the plane with our carry on items for the first flight we had but on the return flight to Barcelona they would not allow us to bring on our carryons because they were suddenly "too big". We flew 3 times prior to this on our trip and our carryons were perfectly fine. They wouldn't let us board the plane unless we paid $45 each for one bag. Ridiculous. Will never use this airline again.

### "certainly avoid Vueling "
We bought a ticket from Keflavik to Porto via Barcelona. You would expect that the airline would check-in your bags to the final destination, and provide boarding passes for both legs of the flight at the departing airport. But no. They would or could only check-In to Barcelona, with no explanation, other than the system didn't show the second leg of the flight. We showed booking number and email, which clearly states that the ticket is for Keflavik to Porto with Vueling all the way, and not two separate tickets. No further explanation or appology for the inconvenience. At Barcelona airport, we spend about 2 hours, walking out of terminal 1, waiting for bags, check-in and going through security. Just to get back to terminal 1. Lucky that we had this time, which we had expected to use for relaxing, since this was now early morning, after a flight overnight. At the check-in they would or could not provide an explanation and gave no appology. All they could say was to write a complaint. Complaining on Vueling's website is basically impossible. All you can do is call the UK on your own bill. So they might have had a technical glitch in their system, or the check-in guy in Reykavik just didn't know how to do what was needed, which in it self is rediculous. But that does not excuse the total lack of taking responsibility, trying to fix the situation, providing a simple appology or trying to elevate the hassle. I recommend using another airline and will certainly avoid Vueling by all means in the future.

### "very tired of the delays"
Me and my husband fly often from London to Rome. We use Vueling for its low cost. But we are getting very tired of the delays. Every flight is at least 30 min late. It causes us great stress as we miss our bus connections in Gatwick and Rome. We will avoid using Vueling in the future. Not worth the savings.

### "dusty, dirty plane"
A horrible journey with Vueling from Rome to Lyon in a  dirty plane. Delay of 15 minutes on the way, 30 minutes on the way back, everyone changes places to the class above (so glad to pay for nothing!) And a long trip to hear chuckling staff laughing in the galley.

### "was comfortable enough"
Bilbao to Gatwick. Pleasantly surprised after reading negative reviews. The plane left on time and arrived early. I'd booked a seat in row 2. Priority boarding was very straightforward. It was comfortable enough with adequate leg room. Back of the seat in front was rather grotty. Didn't eat or drink anything on board, so can't comment on what was on offer. Staff were fine.

### "by far the worst airline"
We flew with Vueling down to Palma from Bergen via Barcelona, and the same route back home. This is by far the worst airline I have travelled with, and I have approximately 100 flights each year, and have flown with more airlines that I can count. Everything from check-in to picking up baggage was a disgrace. Everything was delayed all the time and the lines were nothing but a mess. We has delays with all four flights, ranging from 50 min to two hours. The staff could not care less and was offered no refreshments while waiting, not even on the flight home that was delayed just over two hours. The luggage was delayed over an hour both times. The tickets might seem cheap at first, but the extra costs will keep on coming. It is worth spending 150-250 euros on another airline just to be free of Vueling.

### "blocking the toilet door"
Paris Orly to Lisbon. First of all, I made sure that we had speed boarding and extra leg space when booking my tickets - the extra leg was greatly appreciated, however the check in was so disorganised and busy that we had to queue anyway, so waste of money on that one. No one greeted us when arriving (same when we left the plane). The staff tricked the customers into believing that the front toilet by the cockpit was occupied by blocking the toilet door which kept the lights on red (occupied) leaving customers waiting for the loo. I for one demanded the toilet and they opened it only to re-block it 10mn later making sure they drew the curtains behind. We were sat at the front and could see every time they blocked the toilet door. I have never seen anything so disgusting in my life. A disgrace especially due to the fact that it took them more than an hour to go through the aisle to serve drinks and food blocking the way to the other loo at the back. I didn't feel that the tickets were that cheap.

### "don't expect too much"
Cardiff to Barcelona. This time every thing went to plan other than the fact that they changed the flight times twice before we flew. Luckily we were flexible enough to accommodate the changes. The planes we flew on were old and as others have stated the leg room is poor. Previous experience with Vueling has taught us that they have appalling customer service and if anything goes wrong you're on your own. Our advice would be don't use them if you have to be somewhere on a specific date and time because of their spectacularly cavalier attitude to providing the service. If you're flexible they can be a good alternative to other low cost carriers but don't expect too much.

### "No sorry, no refreshments, nothing"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Florence to Barcelona. Never again. We were supposed to leave Florence at 6.15pm, at around 5pm they advised that the flight was diverted - no announcements. When we asked what is happening, they advised flight diverted due to wind conditions. All other airlines continued to fly. We got bussed to Pisa to catch our flight after 4 hours wait. Still no announcement, sat on the bus in Pisa for an hour, finally arrived via our flight in Barcelona at 2.30am! No sorry, no refreshments, nothing. Never again.

### "it was impossible to contact them"
First time in my life I want to write a review about an airline. Flew Keflavik to Barcelona with Vueling. 3 hours before check-in they cancelled the flight due to "bad weather conditions" and announced they would fly 24 hours later! First: this reason seems to be a cover up since weather conditions for every other airline flying to Spain this day was fine. Second: they had the nerve to postpone/delay the flight for 24 hours instead of checking the "weather", lets's say every couple of hours. Third: it was impossible to contact them. Fourth: they refused to compensate covering their accountability due to "bad weather conditions". Never again.

### "they organised it well"
Flew Vueling Airlines from London Gatwick to Paris CDG. What a great service. We only had carry on luggage but went to drop our bags, it was empty and the lady at check in asked if we wanted to put our luggage in the hold for free as the flight was very busy. We opted for this as we were early so it was nice not to drag it around airport. When it came to being called for our flight they organised it well by calling out seat numbers, so when boarding you were not stuck waiting for people to put their luggage in over head lockers and blocking the gang way. Well done Vueling for using common sense compared to our trip out of Paris with easyJet.

### "never fly this airline again"
Gatwick to Barcelona. Unbelievably awful. Once on the plane, we sat  for 35 minutes while various other people boarded the plane to re-count everyone. Eventually a paper passenger list was produced and every passenger was individually checked in again. This took over an hour. No announcements were made and the cabin crew just seemed to ignore everything and found it quite amusing. Finally on the runway, we were called back again to the terminal as a bag was on the plane which needed to be removed. Again, cabin crew were really unhelpful and didn't inform anyone what was going on. Eventually in the air, over 2 hours late no apology was made and the in flight service failed to happen. The crew pulled the curtain at the front of the plane and appeared to be ignoring passengers' call bells. Overall a totally abysmal customer service experience, particularly considering the plane finally landed after 2 am. I will never fly this airline again.

### "most uncomfortable flight"
Barcelona to Manchester
The most uncomfortable flight of my life. I'm 5'11" so only average height, and my knees were mashed into the back of the seat in front. This wouldn't be too much of a problem were the seatback not hard moulded plastic with some sharpish edges. And if the person in front reclines you may as well kiss goodbye to being able to walk properly after the flight. I'm only giving them 4/10 as the flight was on time and the stewards seemed friendly enough, otherwise it would be 1/10.

### "unsmiling and unwelcoming cabin crew"
Until last month I had managed not to fly Vueling after a number of poor experiences a few years ago. Last month I had no choice, due to a time constraint, for a sector from Lisbon to Amsterdam, and was reminded of why I avoid Vueling, and its sibling companies BA and IB under the IAG umbrella, with Vueling being even worse than Iberia, and that takes some doing. The flight was delayed, I appreciate that can happen, but the level of information given at check in and at the gate was very poor. Once on board the cockpit crew kept us well informed although the announcements in both English and Spanish (which I speak fluently) were almost unintelligible. The cabin crew announcements were even worse, gabbled at high speed in Spanglish, it was hard to tell which language they were attempting to destroy. The seats were hard and uncomfortable and even though I am small, appeared to have less legroom than competitors. The unsmiling and unwelcoming cabin crew went down the aisle so fast it was almost impossible to order and got my (very simple) drink order wrong and argued with me when I said that was not what I'd asked for. Spanish people are usually warm, pleasant, and friendly. I can't help wondering if IB and VY have a special training academy for their cabin crews to teach them to be sour and unhelpful. They are very poor ambassadors for such a delightful country and nation.

### "unprofessional behavior"
Palma di Mallorca to Barcelona. I know that when I booked this airline that it was a low cost airline. But that does not explain the unprofessional behavior of so many employees. From the uncontrolled boarding process, wrong flight numbers on the gate screens, almost zero announcement who and when to board, long waiting lines and finally a broken, new piece of luggage. Then a printed piece of paper stating that the airline is not responsible for any damage!

### "my 'most hated' airline"
Palma to Gatwick via Barcelona. The expected ordeal with Vueling starts as early as on-line check in. My flight was booked with Iberia so naturally I went to the Iberia website for on-line check in, and I was diverted to Vueling, which is in Spanish only. Could not manage Spanish well enough half way so I tried Vueling, then I discovered that my Iberia booking code is not recognized. With many failed attempts, it took me almost an hour, struggling with Spanish, to note that I am actually assigned another Vueling booking code. With this I managed to check in and reserved a decent seat. Had to change at BCN to connect with Gatwick. The connection is not as tiring and less frustrating than dealing with the stupid on line check in procedure. I shall elevate Vueling to the status of my 'most hated' airline.

### "hate/mistreat IB passengers"
Barcelona to Palma de Mallorca. I booked with IB but again found myself on Vueling which I always avoid but to no avail again. I booked very early but was originally allocated a middle seat in a rear row, when the flight was empty at the time. Fortunately I found out and rebooked. Why does Vueling hate/mistreat IB passengers so much is beyond me - and I am a Oneworld Gold Card member. It is funny that now IB and even BA put most passengers to the cheap Vueling, and Vueling operates no service flights, with squeezed non-reclining seats. But the flight did make on time arrival.

### "airline I try hard to avoid"
Copenhagen to Barcelona. Vueling along with SAS are among airlines I try hard to avoid, but I had the misfortune of flying 4 almost consecutive Vueling flights not of my choice. This flight I booked with BA and am rudely told by the check-in staff that Vueling is not of Oneworld, so no membership benefits. But how about the fact that my flight being sold as BA8839? As a result, and as expected, there is no service on air (they do sell food etc hard), and the seat is straight (non-reclining), squeezed, and no TV. It did depart early and arrived early by 10 minutes.

### "I will fly with Vueling again"
This is the second time flying with Vueling on the same route which was Manchester to Alicante return. On this occasion we did have an issue which was my fault. I had accidently put one of the children's names down under her mother's name who was traveling with her and it should of been in her dads name. I didn't notice this until about 1 week before we travelled. I contacted customer services and they said it could only be changed unless I paid £470, I pleaded with them and asked for a manager but was told unless I pay, the name can't be changed which would mean the child would be refused check in. I reluctantly paid this then later sent an e-mail to the CEO of Vueling who was thankfully more understanding and arranged a prompt refund of the £470 and apologised. I am therefore not going to hold this against Vueling to much. I am a great believer that it is not what a company does, but what they do to correct an issue that is important. The check-in at Manchester Airport was fast and efficient and we were offered free check in of our cabin bags. We were about 30 minutes late in taking off but only arrived 10 minutes late into Alicante so can't complain. The aircraft going out was in reasonably good condition although probably could of done a with a clean, but like all budget airlines the planes get cleaned once a day and this being the last flight of the day what can you do. It got us and our baggage there in one piece and the staff were professional and friendly. The return flight from Alicante was pretty much the same as the outbound flight apart from it left exactly on time and the aircraft was newer and cleaner. I will fly with Vueling again and would choose them over the likes of Ryan Air. They give you a very generous luggage allowance of 23kg which is a lot more than many other airlines and they also charge a lot less for it.

### "never fly Vueling again"
Munich to Rome. The flight Munich to Rome went without a problem and although we didn't do the online check-in, we received good places at the emergency exit with a lot of space for our legs. But the flight back to Munich turned to be a horror. Queuing in the line for a check-in in Rome Airport, the Vueling guy behind the desk says "Sorry, the flight is overbooked". What do you mean, overbooked? There are no seats for you on this plane. To be precise: in our plane there were 186 seats and 191 tickets sold for a flight VY6296. We were asked to go to the gate and wait until everyone is seated and maybe there are free seats. So we waited, and then heard our names and an invitation to enter the plane. Sadly, Vueling personnel at the gate and Vueling personnel in the plane could neither count nor talk to each other. After we were standing in the plane in front of all the passengers, it became clear that there are 2 of us, but just 1 free seat. So one of us could fly and another should leave the plane. We asked to leave together. A captain came out and excused for Vueling. We had to leave the plane with the whole plane looking at us as criminals, quietly accusing us of a plane delay. We returned to the gate to hear the news that the next Vueling flight to Munich is in 24 hours. Vueling offered us a flight to Barcelona, a stay over there and a morning flight to Munich. And they do not cooperate with other airlines and could not put us on the different company’s plane leaving for Munich in an hour. Surprisingly, the whole process of getting vouchers for a flight to Barcelona, hotel transfer and so on went super smooth. Finally, we landed in Munich on the following Monday at 10 am, being late to work, exhausted and hungry. Vueling assured us that we will get 250 Euro compensation per person, which is, first of all, hardly covers nerves, stress and lost 12 hours, and secondly, let’s see whether they will transfer this money at all. But all's well that ends well, just never fly Vueling again.

### "grumpy crew, late arrival"
How much can go wrong on a flight from Luton to Amsterdam, well, a lot apparently. Online check-in, not available. Check-in at airport, long queues. Run to gate, final boarding announced. Plane not there. No space between seats, grumpy crew, late arrival. Luckily I didn't check any luggage in.

### "Seat pitch was tolerable"
❎ Unverified |  Gatwick to Rennes. I was apprehensive about using this company based on previous reviews, but figured you can't really do much to ruin a 45-minute hop across the Channel. The plane, half empty, had an overall shabby cabin but reasonably pleasant crew- they didn't do a full trolley service though, and some people appeared to get drinks while I was ignored. Again, I didn't really mind on such a short flight. Seat pitch was tolerable, we landed early and my bags arrived on the same plane as I did- what else can I say?! Their image doesn't exactly scream 'quality' but for very short hops, they're sufficient.

### "we paid extra for this service"
Flew London Gatwick to Rome. Check in at Gatwick was easy and pleasant they even offered to take our hand luggage free of charge for us and put it on the plane. However my criticism is that we paid for priority boarding but when it came to boarding they said we aren't doing it as the flight has come early so we are letting anyone on first. We weren't happy as we paid extra for this service. Also the person we spoke to about it was very rude. Pleasant journey and cabin staff were nice

### "call centre seems to be a joke"
I booked my flight with them in January to travel in June from Birmingham to Barcelona. I received an email stating that my flight had changed to the day before! I had already booked hotels and time off work so couldn't go a day earlier. Requested a refund on 5th April and was told it would take a month. Called today as it's been over a month only to be told that the "refund hasn't been processed". I'd called 5 times before this and every customer services operator I spoke with said that the refund was being processed so they either lied or didn't check the screen properly. My flight has been cancelled and I've received notification of this. But funnily enough, they can't seem to put a refund back into my account. Strange that. Would not recommend. Plus call centre seems to be a joke. Lying or just not checking the system when asked.

### "they seem to have learned a thing or two"
Before leaving Athens, things got complicated. We had to check in at the counter since Vueling don't allow online check in from Athens (it's unclear to me why, since other airlines offer it, and Vueling allow it in most other airports). Once at the counter we were told me and my partner wouldn't be seated together. We had paid extra to pre-select emergency row seats since Vueling's regular seats are far below LCC standards and go beyond uncomfortable for us tall people. So I responded "uhm, we've already got these seats booked and they're together" showing a printout of the confirmation. The employee's response was a simple "No you don't", saying the plane was full, emergency row was already taken and she had no record of the seat booking whose confirmation I was showing her. Several minutes passed with phone calls and eventually they agreed to put us in the 2nd row which is one of their "Premium" seats, slightly tighter than emergency row but at least I can sit there. This flight as well as the prior outbound leg were my first on-time Vueling flights in the 8 years I've occasionally had to fly with them. That was a nice surprise, they seem to have learned a thing or two from their complete chaos last summer. The cabin crew still seemed determined to make sure we wouldn't get too comfortable and were consistently cold and several times downright rude (more on that now). Despite saying the planes was full, the first row (normal seats, but reserved for their "excellence" rates which allow flexible rebooking) turned out to actually be completely empty. The cabin attendants made sure it stayed that way and would harshly chase away the few passengers who tried to sit down there, even if it was just while waiting for the lavatory to become available. They similarly defended the two first overhead baggage compartments, marked as "reserved for excellence passengers". The last boarding passengers dared to leave some duty free bags there and were rudely commanded to put them under their seats. So they remained empty the entire flight. Vueling is one of the increasingly exotic airlines who in 2017 do not allow Bluetooth onboard. This was the first flight on which I witnessed a proper bluetooth crusade by the cabin crew, who went through the rows interrogating passengers wearing anything that resembled wireless headphones. Funny enough charging big laptop Li-Ion batteries during the flight was perfectly fine for those seated in the front rows with power sockets. Halfway through the 3 hour flight the seatbelt lights came on and we were told that due to turbulence everything had to be stowed away, even iPads. Nonetheless the crew went through with the garbage trolley just a minute later. There was no trace of turbulence but the light stayed on for the entire rest of the flight and when asked crew said they didn't know whether the turbulence warning was still real and no, they wouldn't bother to ask the pilots. All in all better than in the past but still a below par experience even by LCC standards.

### "wasn't impressed with Vueling"
Birmingham to Paris Orly. This flight was my first experience of travelling with Vueling; I chose them based purely on the price of a return ticket from BHX to ORY. I only know one other couple who have travelled with Vueling and their experience wasn't great so I had very low expectations. I found booking a very simple process as their app is relatively modern and has a good GUI; I wasn't a fan of their EVA travel assistant (found it to be a bit pointless) but either way booking and check in was painless. As I only had hand luggage my experience with ground staff was minimal, I proceeded straight to gate at BHX and tried to board, here is where the issues began! The Digital Boarding Pass that I had on my telephone wouldn't scan at the gate, neither would the passes of the 4 people in front of me and the 1 behind - they eventually checked us manually and therefore I thought this would be the end of the story, apparently not! We boarded the aircraft to take our seats - I went for the Economy Basic option which gives you 7KG of carry on and nothing else; barely even a seat apparently! The basic layout was a normal narrow body 3x3, the seats; however, were far below par. Very uncomfortable, very thin, no opportunity to recline. Following boarding comes the next stage of the check in faff - after noticing the cabin staff do 3 passenger counts I assumed something wasn't quite right. An hour of counting, recounting and checking followed, and the cabin crew still couldn't get to the bottom of what had happened. Eventually we got on our way; the buy onboard F&B menu was very limited but still very pricey. The crew seemed under pressure and came across very unfriendly; I'm sure the delay didn't help, but this still influences passenger experience. The remainder of the flight went without issue; although my opinion of the airline was still jaded. Overall I wasn't impressed with Vueling; no comfort, poor passenger handling and a poor grasp of administration. However, as I stated at the start I booked the tickets purely for the reasonable price (£70 return! ); I'm not suggesting I would never use them again, but any future travel will, again, be purely for VfM purposes only.

### "Very poor experience"
❎ Unverified |  Alicante to Manchester. This is the first and last time I will book a Vueling Airlines flight. The aircraft was in need of an upgrade. Seats were either ripped in places or had writing on them. I don't think the cleaners had been on before we embarked as there was rubbish on the floor and in seat pockets and bits of food on the tables, which had obviously not been wiped. Some seats were broken and would not sit upright, causing discomfort to the passenger behind. We sat on the plane for an hour before take off with no explanation. We were only told that we were delayed and had to sit there for a bit. English translations were mumbled and we could barely hear the pilot let alone know what he was saying. Very poor experience.

### "the worst flight I have ever had"
Rome to Tel Aviv. It was the worst flight I have ever had. First of all, they changed the time of the departure. When we had to get on the plane they did not let the passengers in for some reason. The crew of the airline came late and the plane departed 30 minutes late! Except of this, the flight was at night and the stewardesses would not stop talk loud and wake up everyone. I will never fly with this company again and would not recommend it to anyone!

### "arrived on-time without incident"
Flew roundtrip from Edinburgh to Barcelona and had a decent experience. While the cabin was fairly warm on both flights, things were quite uneventful and the trips departed and arrived on-time without incident.

### "very poor customer service"
Flew Vueling from Lisbon to Barcelona. Very poor customer service. The gate numbers changed 3 times and almost more than 10 passengers missed the flight because of that. The staff were not at all co-operative and did not help us in any way. Also, there is no representative for Vueling Airlines at Lisbon airport which makes it very difficult to contact the Vueling staff. Overall the experience was horrible. Even though the fares are cheap the customer service is worst. I would say avoid flying with Vueling.

### "flight has been canceled"
Berlin to Barcelona. The problems started, when I wanted to do the online Check-in for my flight. When I wanted to start the process of checking in online, it wasn't possible. Because the flight has been canceled. They didn't send any message or information about that via e-mail. I just saw it "by accident" in that moment, 3 hours before the actual flight. The website gave me the option to change my flight. but the earliest possible date of flying was 9 days later. So I checked other airlines to be able to fly earlier since I had to go back as soon as possible but since it was such short term, all the flights where more than 200 euros and I couldn't affort that. So I had to change the date to 9 days later. The days after I checked the flights once in a while to see if there was another flight coming up and suddenly, there was another flight from Vueling for 7 days from the original flight. Since I had to go back as soon as possible I had to change my flight to that day to arrive at least 2 days earlier, that was cheaper than buying a new flight at another company, but I still had to pay 150 Euros. When I reclaimed the situation at Vueling, wanting a refund at least for that flight I had to pay, they denied it. Telling me that they acted as their policy describes it and that I had no right on anything. I wroted to them again and got the same answer, again.

### "flight boarded and departed on time"
I was dreading this flight and expecting the worst given all the terrible reviews this airline gets but I suppose everyone has their good days too. Our Vueling Airlines flight was from Rome to London Gatwick. We had to check in at the airport, where we found the desks to be fully staffed. The check in lady was very friendly and polite. The flight boarded and departed on time. The cabin was clean and the cabin crew were as courteous as you get on low cost carriers. I got a couple of free glasses of mineral water when I asked. We landed on time too. All in all I very decent experience. Perhaps they are making a big effort to turn things around.

### "may well end up paying much more "
After looking on skyscanner, I booked a flight with Vueling Airlines to fly from Manchester to Amsterdam. This is a 2 hour direct flight and it was the cheapest option there (£60). 3 weeks after booking I received an email stating that my flight had been changed and that I would still be departing Manchester at the same time, but that there had been a change to my flight. I was to fly to Barcelona, where I would have to spend 12 hours in the Airport before boarding the plane the following morning to fly to Amsterdam. The same change had been made to my return flight. They had added an extra day, a whole 24 hours to my flight. I obviously asked for a refund and they gave me a refund of £22 or the original £60. I imagine this was done in the hope that I would be happy I got something back and would drop the case. My advice (for what it is worth) never use Vueling Airlines. You may well end up paying much more for what at first seams like a "cheap" flight!

### "never recommend this airline"
Gatwick to Rome. We were told we could not have a seat on the plane just as the flight was about to leave, even though we had paid for tickets months ago. The reason we were denied? They had sold too many tickets for the flight out of what one can assume is just pure greed. We tried to check in online the day before, but my partner's Japanese passport was not accepted for online checkin, so we arrived at Gatwick 2 hours before the flight to check in, (as stated on the website) but we were told more people had checked in online before us by this time so we could not have our seat. They next flight they offered us to remedy the situation was 24 hours later. This reduced our 1.5 day weekend break to Rome to just half a day! We also ended up spending about 6+ hours talking with unhelpful (unsympathetic) reps and arranging hotels etc making it a very stressful ordeal indeed. Staff were not even apologetic and just acted as if this was totally normal, even the next day when we did finally fly the same staff who denied our flight the previous day didn't even mentioned or acknowledge the situation. I would never recommend this airline to anyone. Buyer beware.

### "a parody of customer service"
I flew from Prague to Malaga via Barcelona to continue by taxi to my final destination in Nerja for a week of vacation, I got a one way ticket as my return flight has been already arranged with different company. I bought it from Iberia but flight was operated by Vueling and it was my first (and I have to say last) experience with these airlines. The flight from Prague was delayed because the plane arrived 30' late but it took the crew one hour to get us on our way. Because of that I missed the connecting flight from Barcelona to Malaga (unluckily it must have been probably the only flight on time on that day), so I contacted the customer service. As there were no more flights to Malaga they offered me either overnight stay in Barcelona and taking the first morning flight the next day or taking a flight to Granada, of course "they would arrange my luggage to be re-routed properly". I opted for the 2nd option even though it meant my cost for taxi from Granada would be double compared to the cost of from Malaga, but vacation time is precious and I did not want to waste the time. When we landed in Granada I found out that my luggage was sent to Malaga and here the whole nightmare started. The Vueling representative documented my case and assured me my luggage would be delivered to my address in Nerja the next day, ergo Tue. To cut the long story short - here's Fr night, my luggages still not here even after several calls to their "customer service" line. The customers service rep repeatedly provided assurance "it would arrive in the next couple of hours", but it never did and shouting was of no help either, because as I realised throughout the process their call centre folks just open specific claim case, read you the status but give you no guarantee that the info is correct, can't give you precise ETAs, can't call you back and can't basically do anything. What a parody of customer service is that? in the end my week of vacation was quite ruined as I was stuck without my things, had to buy a lot of new stuff plus a new suitcase, while the service line of Vueling keeps telling me that "according to their system my case would be delivered in the next couple of hours"; no word of apology beyond scripted dialogues. I can understand that mistakes happen and people are not perfect, it's natural, but what separates serious companies is how they handle such situations and how they try to fix what they screwed up.

### "Vueling were having a good day"
Managed to get return flights Manchester to Barcelona for £40 return for the 4 of us (2 Adt 2 Kids) during half term week. Was initially expecting an email to confirm it was an error but turned out to be a promotional fare so happy days! After reading some of the horror stories on here before we travelled I was already regretting my decision to book but have to say I was reasonably impressed. No online check-in available at Manchester and online seat reservations were about £4 each from memory which was annoying as I had already checked us in and reserved our seats for free on the return leg. 2 check in desks open at Manchester so it took a while but we got seats together and weren't bumped off the flight so that was a good start. Only a short break so no check in luggage. Departure on time on a smart new A320 with the thin seats and smiling friendly crew. Plenty of room in the overhead bins for our hand luggage. On-board service was efficient and drinks / snacks were reasonably priced. Club sandwich was tasty. Airbridge at the gate in Barcelona and so we were on the Aerobus to the city within 30 mins. And what an excellent service, €10.20 return to Placa de Catalunya. Smart, clean buses with plenty of luggage storage every 5 mins, free WiFi and usb charging ports - Manchester could learn a thing or 2!. Return flight was on time, and easier to check-in/ board as we had checked in online and reserved seats before we left the UK. Security was also a lot easier - no messing about taking out liquids in plastic bags and electronics into a separate tray like at Manchester - just throw the case through the x-ray with it all in and on your way - great! We were the last pax to get to the gate as it's quite a trek to where Vueling fly from so had to check out bags to the hold. Flight was full and on time. Smiley and friendly crew again. Made a fuss of the kids which was nice. Service was efficient and no gifts or scratchcards which was nice. People onboard saying they had paid far more for seats booked through BA / Iberia and expecting that level of service as Veuling is owned by the parent company. I bit my tongue on how much we had paid. Landed on time in Manchester and the bags beat us to the reclaim thanks to the ridiculous queues at T3. How they get away with such a small terminal for so many low cost flights is another matter. Overall I was thoroughly impressed - my only niggle is the lack of online check-in at Manchester. If it goes right they are great but it's when things start to go wrong you may have problems. Thankfully for us Vueling were having a good day.

### "service extremely poor"
❎ Unverified |  Gatwick to Paris. Flight was due to leave at 0755. Eventually took off around 0820, then some time later we were told that due to a technical fault the flight was returning to Gatwick. We waited on the aircraft for 4 hours, denied complementary refreshments or food for our children (although had missed breakfast and lunch due to the delay) unless paying for refreshments, which we eventually had to do, having young children thirsty and hungry. Advised us that we on landing would only then receive a voucher for lunch and compensation, received nothing on landing except a form to advise how to complain? Staff were unhelpful, lacked any personal skills and general service extremely poor.

### "snacks and drinks reasonably priced"
Paris Orly to Lisbon. Great flight. Pleased that we were able to opt for XL seats with legroom. Staff were friendly and snacks and drinks were reasonably priced. Only suggestion would be that it would be a good idea to say which terminal the flight departed from. The indication on the boarding card isn't clear enough.

### "only reachable through FaceBook"
❎ Unverified |  Amsterdam to Lisbon. Booked this flight through a website I've used for years to book all manner of flights (work, leisure etc). I wanted to take sports equipment, but couldn't find this option on their Vueling page. I decided to make sure I have some cargo space, and booked in luggage. This cost me €45. I then get an email confirming the flight, and in this email sports equipment gets mentioned. This is costing €45 each way, so €90. This already made the ticket one of the most expensive on this trajectory. I asked customer service, only reachable through FaceBook, if a can change my 'luggage' in 'sport equipment' and pay the remainder. After 5 days I'm told that 'No, this not possible, we handled everything correctly'. So I have to fork out another €90 on top of the €45 I already paid extra. The €145 flight is now costing €290. Be warned!

### "positive surprise with Vueling"
Barcelona to Porto. Pleasant and uneventful flight. On time departure, on time arrival. Even though there was a bit of a queue for baggage drop, the lady was very nice and she even gave us new printed boarding passes, the old fashioned way, what we really liked. Cabin crew were polite but rather cold and not very friendly, but they let us change seats to the last row, which was empty. The refurbished cabin was clean and modern, with slimline Recaro seats with tight legroom, which however did not matter as we had a whole row for ourselves. And it's fine anyway, non-lowcost airlines use this tight seating too. A positive surprise flying with Vueling, after reading all the terrible reviews.

### "last time we fly with Vueling"
Barcelona to Gatwick. This was the first and will be the last time we fly with Vueling! The plane was sat at the terminal in Barcelona from at least 1pm waiting for take off at 5.30pm, (we could see it). A shared flight with BA and Iberia so it was not only Vueling customers they were letting down. It would seem that there was not a crew available and a standby one was called for - obviously it seems it takes a minimum of 2 hours for them to get their act together, even though this flight was known about for many months! The flight was delayed and delayed and eventually we were called for boarding at 6.20pm. The crew were extremely abrupt and constantly advised us that they were a standby crew seemingly to make us feel grateful, even the Captain reminded us of this in her speech over the intercom. A half cup of water was given out to passengers. The flight did not take off until approx 7.30pm - the blame put at the feet of Air traffic Control and the wind. The crew proceeded to do the usual run of expensive snacks (2.50 euros for a kitkat!) and teas and coffees - however, being in row 35 they ran out of time to serve us and without saying why they packed up their trolley and headed off without explanation! We landed at 9.50pm, 2.5 hours late, and a rough and jerky landing. If you don't pay the minimum of 3.99 per ticket to choose your seats you are given totally random seats. My husband and I were in the same row but sat in seats A and E, we complained at the check in desk and this was changed after much discussion. It was apparent when seated on the aircraft that this had happened to many of the passengers. Vueling, never again.

### "Worst airline I've used"
Vienna to Tenerife via Barcelona. Worst airline I've used. For the first and the last time for sure. The flight was delayed 5 hours, no Information provided for the reason of the delay and when the flight will likely be conducted. The destination was changed too, because the Airport Tenerife Norte had already closed. Thus they flew to Tenerife Sur but did not ensure a proper transfer to somewhere else. Additionally, they lost my baggage and since I was there on a trekking trip, this mattered a lot. I only got it three days later and in between I had substantial expenses for new clothes and equipment. The main problem is that Vueling only cashes in the Money but does not provide any service at all, even though they are obliged to. They are evading as much as they can just not to get in touch with the customers. Get in contact with Vueling via internet is impossible because there are only online forms and you only get an automatic reply. The hotline is always busy and costs a ton of money. I also went to the Airport but there is only a counter of the mother company Iberia and they say that they do not have anything to do with Vueling which obviously is a blatant lie. Thanks to EU-regulation 261/2004 I was reimbursed for the delay. The best thing is to avoid this airline if they offer some cheap flights. The stress afterwards was not worth it to save a few bucks.

### "will never use them again"
Barcelona to London Gatwick. I thought easyJet was bad but Vueling has taken their crown. Both legs of my journey were delayed. My return flight was atrocious. Flight was delayed, had to wait an hour to board then another hour before the plane took off. We were sat on the plane with the pilot giving us excuses. I should have been back in London at 6.30pm instead it was after 9pm. I will never use them again and they should be avoided like the plague.

### "my flight had been canceled"
Malaga to Oran via Barcelona in July 2016. The day before my flight, I received an email from Vueling telling me I could check-in online, something I never do because I prefer checking in at the airport and be sure everything is right. I showed up 3 hours before the departure time. My flight was not announced on any of the screens and I thought it was because I was a bit early. After waiting for an hour and starting to see flights that would depart later than my flight, I decided to go to the Vueling counter and figure out what was going on. To my surprise, the Vueling employee informed me that my flight had been canceled and rescheduled to 3 days later. I was in total shock, they said they sent me an email but I showed them the confirmation email they sent me and they did recognize their mistake. However when I asked if I could be put in a hotel because I had to wait 3 nights in the airport, I was denied and told I could file a complaint and that the airline reserves the right to cancel any flight they want for whatever reason and that I agreed to those terms when I bought my ticket. In short, I was stranded in the airport for 72 hours. I have been asking for a compensation they owe me according to international laws for 6 months, and I have been told twice that they sent me the money, then there was a mistake, then they sent me the money again and I have to wait another 15 days (I highly doubt they sent anything and I'm pretty sure they will again tell me that there was a mistake and they could not transfer the funds).

### "false promise of flights"
Booked Edinburgh to Barcelona return flights in August 2016 for my family to travel in July 2017. In October 2016 I receive an email saying flight has been changed, not only to a very late flight but on completely different day. Completely unworkable for a family with young kids. I phoned customer services to cancel, they offered a refund which I accepted. Six weeks later still no sign of my refund and despite three calls I've been unable to get through to their customer service department. I was flying out with other parties who also booked with them, and have had similar refund issues. Apparently they 'forgot' to issue the refund. They've now been sitting with my money now for 7 months on the false promise of flights that didn't even exist. Meanwhile I've had the extra expense of booking flights else where.

### "recent trip restored my faith in them"
After a couple of poor experiences, my recent trip from Barcelona to La Palma with Vueling rather restored my faith in them. My wife has recently had an operation on her knee, and it makes moving about rather difficult, with the ability to stretch the knee out quite important. Whilst there was no need to a full "disabled" service, we were impressed that we were given priority boarding and the staff offered to let us sit in an unoccupied front row to make her flight more comfortable. Both flights were punctual, one in the newer planes with the thin seating, and the other in the older plane with traditional seating. Frankly, I cannot see any difference vis a vis leg room or comfort. One slight criticism - on every Vueling flight I ever take it seems an eternity before the crew get around to doing the drinks / food service, and this one was no exception. Is it company policy to wait for over an hour before refreshments are offered?

### "nothing positive to say"
Rome to Geneva with Vueling. Nothing positive to say about flying with this airline. First, of course, the flight was an hour delayed, no announcement, until beginning of boarding. Upon boarding the ground staff wrote the list of passengerss manually on an empty sheet of paper. This cost another 30 mins. After finally entering a dirty aircraft I was greeted by a spider amid the food of the last passenger on the seat. Return flight was also delayed, roughly an hour, same conditions. To give the airline a second chance was not possible. After booking flights from Zurich to London months in advance, they re-routed the direct flight to an 1 stop flight with a 16 h overnight stay in Barcelona. The same goes for the return. After a call, the flight got cancelled, yet the complete paid ticket has not been refunded for over 12 weeks (and still counting). Despite numerous attempts of contact, not one single response aside from facebook bot answers, promising customer support would get in contact asap. Try to avoid this airline.

### "the service was excellent"
Amsterdam to Rome with Vueling. After reading all the negative reviews I was paranoid about my two flights with Vueling, my big fears were that would miss my international connecting flight and also that they would lose my luggage, well for me they were absolute gold, both flights the check in was available 2 hours prior to departure, both flights then check in was painless and boarding and then departure time were to the minute. We flew on the "excellence" fare and had free alcoholic beverages and food on the flight, the service was excellent, the seats were very good, front row with no one next to you guaranteed, our luggage was first off the plane and there is not one negative I could say about this airline except that I am ashamed I let my prejudices run off without any just basis. I would fly with them again if I was going to travel inter-continental in Europe again with hesitation and advise people to give them a fair go and not listen too much to negative comments.

### "Vueling was not very cooperative"
Luton to Zurich. A few weeks after I bought their cheap tickets, they cancelled my flight in July 2016, and when I looked around for new tickets the prices had gone up. But what I am angry about is that the process of getting the refund was extremely painful, and I did not even get all my money back. To get the refund I was asked to get refund confirmation from Vueling and send it to eDreams (my vendor), but Vueling was not very cooperative. I had to call them several times and argue with them very hard just to get the confirmation. I had to argue because they were very slow to understand the situation and wanted to bother as little as possible. Why couldn't Vueling take care of this process themselves and send it directly to eDreams in the first place? Why give the customer an additional trouble of running around for a refund? Furthermore, the eDreams service charge of £95 was non-refundable. Because the cancellation was entirely Vueling's fault, it is only right that they pay the service charge. But they refused to do so. I appealed to several places but no one could help. I never got this amount back.

### "zero information from Vueling"
Stuttgart to Barcelona. Arriving at STR airport, everything seems fine. According to the airport flight monitor, there was no delay, sched. dep. 14:55. I also checked on the Vueling website and was shocked: new expected departure time 19:00 because of "operational reasons". But was the flight delayed or not? The airport still said the flight would be on time. So I checked in normally, went to the gate, the gate staff came on time and turned on their computer. Only problem: there was no aircraft at the gate. They knew nothing about the delay. When passengers complained and showed them the Vueling website with the delay, the staff announced: "We don't know where the plane is, but according to passengers the plane didn't even take off from Barcelona. We got food vouchers, but still no information whether the flight would even operate. 4 hours later, they announced a new departure time of 19:30. In the end, the plane departed at 19:55 - five hours later than expected. The flight itself was okay, the plane was very new, service was normal, the seat pitch was quite low. But they didn't want to comment on the delay, very unprofessional. The return flight had also a delay, but at least "just" 40 minutes. Customer service via E-Mail is an absolute horror, it takes weeks for an answer. Telephone hotline is constantly occupied. In short: the airline has the potential to be a good LCC, but their operations are just poor (nicely said). The customer gets zero information from Vueling, even the airport gets zero information. No customer service available. A lot of delays. The Airbus planes are in good condition, inflight staff is decent, seat pitch could be better. I'll try the airline again in the coming years, hoping they improved their operational difficulties.

### "may cost you a fortune"
Rome to Manchester. We were charged £412 GBP for a "Change of Name Charge". There was a spelling error in the name on one of the two tickets in our party. The Vueling website states that misspelling of names will be met with reasonable accommodation, and since this error was more than 3 characters, we were to be charged full price for a new ticket on the day of travel. We purchased our tickets more than a month ago, and by January 2nd you can imagine the price to buy a ticket on the day of would be insane. They made no exceptions, refused to allow me to speak to a manager on the phone, saying it was "Not allowed", and told me that if there was an airport ticket office the manager would speak to me. The airport ticket office, despite being painted from floor to ceiling in yellow Vueling with yellow Vueling banners and staffed by folks with yellow "Vueling" lanyards informed me that they do not work for Vueling, and since they are contracted from outside, cannot help me, nor do they have a manager to speak with. In the end, out of options (Alitalia had only business class), I had to fork over nearly €500, which is a small fortune to me, to these people for a charge that seemed as exorbitant as it was ridiculous. Something as simple a few incorrect letters for one passenger's surname may cost you a fortune. When you read on the Vueling website that reasonable accommodation will be made, firstly, do not believe them, secondly, know that they have already ensured that there will be no one available to you to help you or to even offer an explanation, either in person or even on the phone.

### "Vueling are totally incompetent"
Birmingham to Malaga. Vueling Airlines are totally incompetent, they have lost my daughters luggage and despite us having all the correct information , they have no customer service to either help us track it or file a claim for compensation. When we then looked at other online reviews it appears this is a very common story. My strong advice, never use Vueling Airlines.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
My flight today was supposed to leave Florence airport at 3:45 for a quick 1.5 hour flight over to Prague for the last stretch of my honeymoon. I am now currently sitting in Pisa airport, lost and confused as to how I ended up here without any explanation from your airline. The original flight was supposed to leave Florence at 3:45, but due to bad weather the flight was delayed. Then after 5 different time changes (from 1 hour delayed, then 2 hours delayed, back to on time, then 1 hour delayed and then finally diverted to Pisa airport due to fog). I know this is not your fault. Unless, somehow, you can control the weather, which I highly doubt since Vueling don't even have a representative  in this airport for us to talk to. We get on the bus to take us to Pisa airport, which goes relatively smoothly (which I am guessing has everything to do with the Florence airport staff and not Vueling) until we get to the Pisa airport where we proceed to drive to some back entrance, park in front of a security gate and wait for 35 minutes before reversing and driving around to the front entrance. Once the busses park, the lights come on and everyone starts to look around lost. No one is there from Vueling to tell us what to do next, so all the passengers get off the bus and start grabbing their luggage. There is still no instructions on what bags to grab or leave, no one there to help us unload our bags from the bus and no one to explain what we do next. All the passengers start asking Pisa airport staff what to do and they are able to explain that we need to leave our checked bags, get our carry on luggage and then head to security (even though we have already cleared security in Florence). My wife and I are now sitting by the gates in Pisa airport with no information on what is happening. We have asked around and no one from Vueling is located at this airport to provide assistance. Vueling have left travelers from a lot of different countries stranded and confused, with little direction on when we can expect to leave. I have even stopped getting your email updates on our flight status. It is now 4 hours and 15 minutes past the scheduled departure time and I still have no idea when I will arrive in Prague for the last week of my honeymoon. I have no one to talk to from Vueling, their website doesn't work properly and Vueling staff is nonexistent. I have flown a lot in my life, and want to congratulate Vueling on being the absolute worst airline I have ever used.

### "never boarded on time"
Paris CDG to Barcelona, and as always Vueling flight is delayed. A few minutes this time, but I have never boarded on time with this airline. Cold cabin temperature. Friendly staff. Funny part is that more than one person enters the plane with more than one cabin luggage and most oversized. Space between seats is very deplorable.

### "pretty frustrating experience"
Barcelona to Amsterdam. All in all it was a bit of a debacle from start to finish. Firstly, I tried to check in for my flight online the day before I was due to fly. I found that in order to get a seat I had to pay an extra 15 euros because all of the cheaper seat options were already booked? I decided I didn't want to play into this absolute scam and would check in before my flight at the actual airport so I didn't have to pay extra for a seat on a flight I'd already paid for. I arrived to the airport on time, tried to check in and was told that the flight was overbooked and they couldn't fit my onto the plane - but they would put me on the next available flight about 3 hours later. Feeling pretty bummed, I did a solid stint of airport people watching for a few hours waiting for my next flight back to Amsterdam. I was told by multiple staff members that I was entitled to a 250 euro compensation payment and could contact the customer service team in the next few days. I filed a claim through the Vueling site, received an email confirming my request for compensation, provided my bank details and then, radio silence. I've sent multiple emails asking for updates on my claim, even resorting to commenting on their facebook posts to try and get a response from anyone. It's been a month since my initial flight and so far Vueling have been avoiding me like the plague. Overall, a pretty frustrating experience to be honest.

### "on time, and all good"
Gatwick to Barcelona return. Having looked at Vueling Airlines reviews was somewhat apprehensive regarding this airline. However, no problem checking in, flights on time, and all good. Flight out on A321 with enough leg room for a short flight. Return flight A320 loads of leg room. Would suggest checking in online to make life easy.

### "ground staff took me for a fool"
Flew Vueling from Paris Orly to Barcelona El Prat. Flight was delayed and the ground staff took me for a fool, I could find out online from when I arrived at the airport that the flight was delayed but Vueling told passengers that the flight was on time right up until the time of departure when reluctantly they announced it was delayed. One thing I can't stand is been taken for a fool, and Vueling did this which is sad as I had a nice flight with them the previous year!

### "terrible online service"
Munich to Rome with Vueling. Terrible online service. I did not receive any confirmation email right after I booked my tickets (checked, several times, in the spam folder). I had to ask for a new email, which only arrived several hours later. And then the nightmare begun again with the check in online. I tried many times to have the boarding pass sent to my email, always unsuccessfully. I thought then I could just print it at the airport: in MUC, Vueling is probably the only airline which doesn't provide any automated printing machine. I solved the issue downloading the Vueling app, which was the only way to get my boarding pass, besides waiting in the check in queue (which totally defeats the purpose of check in online, doesn't it?)

### "on the way back it was a nightmare"
Barcelona to Luton with Vuelign. Booked and paid extra for XL seats. We chose our XL seats 4 months before our flight, we had an email a few weeks before our flight saying the flight time was 30 minutes earlier which was fine by us. On the way out the XL seats were honoured without a problem, however on the way back it was a nightmare, we checked our bags in at the airport in the priority queue which you get with a XL seat, the guy at the check in desk checked our boarding cards and everything seemed OK. When it came to boarding, we were given priority boarding however when we got on the plane our allocated seats were on a normal now which was 4 rows behind the XL seats. It turns out they had changed the plane but not bothered to inform us or change our seats - instead letting somebody else book the XL seats (the normal seats have absolutely no leg room). After a lot of complaining they eventually moved the couple in the XL seats to the front row and gave us our XL seats. On returning to the UK I sent an email to Vueling outlining my concerns and asking for a reply, after a month they sent me an email asking for my flight details which I promptly replied with, I then got an email back saying they had already replied to me and that they wouldn't be looking into this again. After sending another 3 emails asking for a copy of their original reply they still haven't replied (8 weeks after my original email). Seems like a cop out to me as they obviously can't be bothered to answer my concerns. Wouldn't fly with them again.

### "will avoid this airline"
Rome to Amsterdam. They started the checkin at 9.20 instead of 9.40, which is good, but they simply moved us from the gate to the tunnel connecting it to the plane and left us wait there 20 minutes (it was so cold there) without information. The seats are a nightmare. It is not possible to stay seated (I am not saying comfortable, just seated) if you are taller than 1.80m. If something falls on the floor, good luck if you want to try to take it. Nothing to read at my seats apart from the menu because if you want a snack or a beverage you have to pay. Dirty table and napkins left on the floor from the previous flight. The hostess kept answering Spanish to Italian people speaking english. I will avoid this airline in the future.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flew Vueling from Luton to Amsterdam. Read some poor reviews and was a little concerned. However, everything was fine. Customer service was great. I love it when someone anticipates your needs and gives you what you need, without you having to ask. For me the customer service was the best I have experienced even with premium airlines. Slight delays of 15 mins on both flights, but this happens with all airlines. The price was brilliant.

### "stewards turning a blind eye"
Barcelona to Gatwick. Despite arriving at the gate first, we weren't able to go to the aircraft as my daughters twin buggy was too wide to go down the escalator, result we were held until everyone else was boarded, then it was said we couldn't take bags on board as the lockers were full. We didn't have time to get stuff from our cases for children (and 22 month old twins etc) we were even threatened with being refused to travel. The on board steward was flustered as the flight was already late, consequently I had a bag full of wet and ruined clothes due to a bottle of spirits being broken en-route. People making phone calls whilst we were still in the air were ignored by stewards who were turning a blind eye.

### "failing to make refunds"
Fuerteventura to Barcelona. Vueling Airlines has cancelled so many flights I've lost count. On this date they switched aircraft and the loading turned into a free for all. Spanish speakers seemed to be 'allocated' seats in their preferred positions, others like us were dumped in the back, and separated, despite paying for up front seats together. Crew ignored any request to change. You get the full measure of how good a company really is by their Customer Service responses. Vueling have made numerous promises to refund excess charges, but despite numerous promises of payment this has never come. I would never book too far in advance or make any large payment to this company, as they appear to be failing to make refunds.

### "worst customer service"
Barcelona to Birmingham. The worst customer service at the airport I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. Further more, on returning home and sending Vueling an email and asking them to comment on the facts I had outlined, they rudely sent a computer generated response stating I was not entitled to compensation. The word compensation or anything alluding to a refund or similar was never mentioned once in my email to them. Their behaviour towards customers is shockingly unprofessional but not unexpected. I will never fly with them again.

### "they run such a very poor operation"
Working in Paris and living in Alicante, I travel home for the weekend on a very regular basis. Vueling are never, ever on time which, for a business traveller, is unacceptable. May I also wonder how I can pay euros 77 to fly Paris to Alicante and two days later fly the reverse trip for over euros 200? I travel to Alicante on 10 Nov 2016 and return to work 13 Nov 2016 and the cost is euros 890! I'd love to understand the pricing management and suggest Vueling provide regular business travellers, the folk that keep them going 12 months per year, with some form of stability. As they run such a very poor operation, they expose themselves to the most brutal criticism by being always late, poor inflight food/service/comfort, and rip off fares. easyJet are a refreshing difference, at least they take off on time.

### "staff friendly and helpful"
Luton to Barcelona with Vueling. I had an amazing flight, staff were friendly and helpful. From check-in to boarding the flight it was all easy. The flight itself was pleasant and with the announcements the captain and crew kept us informed from start to finish.

### "most unpleasant flight"
Newcastle to Barcelona with Vueling. First trip to Barcelona and first with this airline. A party of 75 passengers and flight delayed by 4 hours. It was the most unpleasant flight I have endured in my life. Not only were the seats to close together, the staff were exceptionally unpleasant. Apparently there had been no backup crew to travel to Newcastle which caused the delay, is that the fault of the passengers? There was not a welcome and everything they did was quite unprofessional and begrudgingly. This is not the type of service you would expect when the customers are not the cause of the delay. On disembarking one of the passengers left a jacket with their passport which was realised when on the bus to terminal. When the crew were ask in airport they retorted there had been nothing left on the plane. We were not given any vouchers for delay and jacket was recovered from the plane. Quite an exasperating situation. No thanks to Vueling or their staff. Return journey total different experience but will not use this airline again.

### "no communication or representative"
Plane boarded 2 hours late, with only one engine functioning. Taxied out onto tarmac. Sat 1.5 hours with no air conditioning, crying babies. Deboarded onto tarmac and took busses back to baggage in terminal. Waited over 2 hours for bags. No communication or representative. No email or phone call. No excuse. By the time we went through security again, there was no one at the designated meeting place for information. Vueling has no office or desk in Amsterdam. We now know why Vueling is the third worst airlines in the world. 40% late, and chance of missing connections. It's operated by Iberia, an even worse airline. We booked with another airlines for that flight and return trip. Still have not been reimbursed. They also owe $250 after any two hour delay per European law.

### "plane new, comfortable, clean"
Edinburgh to Alicante with Vueling. After reading other reviews I was worried about the airline choice I had made. However, both flights in and out departed on time and arrived at the destinations early. The plane itself was new, comfortable, clean and has leather seats. I went for an XL seat after reading the reviews, the plane was quiet so I tried a normal seat it was all good. I'm very impressed with Vueling and will fly again with them soon

### "gladly book with them again"
Manchester to Alicante return. Outbound we were advised at check-in there were only 26 people going to be on the flight. We waited in the lounge and upon checking the board, our flight status had been changed to a 20 minute delay, which was no big deal. Boarding was very quick due to only having to board 26 passengers. Once we were in the air cabin crew told us to sit where we wanted. The cabin crew were very nice, chatty and smiley. They didn't seem to have a great deal of food or drink on board so choice was limited, but on the plus side which is rare for budget airlines we were offered free water, We arrived in Alicante on time. Return we were delayed by 1 hour, once again didn't bother us. This aircraft looked a little older compared to the outbound flight but certainly not shabby. Cabin crew weren't as smiley as the outbound flight apart from one, but they were attentive enough. This flight was nearly full and fairly uneventful. I hope Vueling continues to operate flights from Manchester. I tend to choose my flights based on price, so if Vueling is still the cheapest when I am booking, I will gladly book with them again.

### "an absolute shambles"
Gatwick to Rome. Make sure you read the terms and conditions and pay for seat. Vueling regularly overbook seats. They say you can check in at the airport at no extra charge. I am waiting to leave Gatwick (fog delay). Four empty seats for no shows, but have left three friends behind to wait for the next flight as they hadn't prepaid seats. They were in a wait list and first in line to take the no shows. An absolute shambles. I will never fly with them again

### "fly with Vueling again happily"
Edinburgh to Barcelona return. My wife and I had booked Vueling Airlines as part of week long holiday in Salou. Having read poor reviews was a little apprehensive. Pleasantly surprised by smooth, friendly and efficient service. Staff polite and helpful at check in, especially at Barcelona airport where experienced smoothest check in process I have ever experienced. Cabin crew polite, efficient and helpful all through flight. Would fly with Vueling again happily.

### "seats were so small"
Vueling flight from Firenze to Berlin was on time and check in was great. The seats were so small that I was in pain for the whole way, Cappuccino was from Nestle and cheap for 2.60 Euro. The announcements were mainly in Spanish to my surprise. Not many Spanish passengers, mostly Italians and Germany. Overall, fair value for money.

### "overall a good experience"
Gatwick to Florence return. This was our first time flight with Vueling Airlines. After reading bad reviews we were a bit apprehensive but all went smoothly. The seats were comfortable, with good service from cabin crew. The flights in and out were on time, overall a good experience and will use again.

### "a very good experience"
London Gatwick to Rome. Great flight. The seats were comfortable and the aircraft was in good shape. Staff at Gatwick were very efficient and helpful, as were the flight attendants. The flight was smooth and although the cabin was quite warm, all in all it was a very good experience. Thank you.

### "crew were very attentive"
No issues on my flight from Edinburgh to Barcelona on 15th September or return on 25th September. Check in at Edinburgh was speedy with a friendly cabin crew and flight left on time. I travelled on Vueling's "excellence" fare which guarantees a front row seat (middle seat empty) with unlimited drinks including alcoholic drinks as well any food you like as part of the fare. Return flight from Barcelona includes priority check in, fast track security and free access to the business lounge. Flight boarded on time from Barcelona but was delayed due to air traffic control restrictions outwith the control of Vueling. Once again the cabin crew were very attentive. Checked several times if I wanted any additional drinks or snacks. Overall I can only say positive things about my flights and would choose to fly with Vueling on my next trip to Barcelona.

### "most incompetent, uncommunicative"
Barcelona to Seville. Truly the most incompetent, uncommunicative, scattered gate staff and check in procedure I have encountered anywhere. We checked in without boarding passes because the site would not give us one and 2 long distance calls to an agent before leaving Canada told us, you are ok, just show up at the airport and you will get one. we arrive early and there is no seat assigned to us. They oversold. We get on the flight and my luggage doesn't arrive with me, though my friend's does, thank God. For 2 days I called Vueling to see the status. Often the phone never got answered. Their English was horrific so I had to find Spanish people who spoke enough English to understand me then speak to Vueling in Spanish. It took two days for the call to come that my luggage would arrive just in time for our departure to our next destination. They found it. No hint for 2 days that they had found it. No one at the airport told me what I was allowed to buy to subsist until and if my luggage was found.

### "luggage did not accompany me"
Edinburgh to Marrakesh via Barcelona. Plane late leaving Edinburgh. Arrived in Marrakesh to find my luggage did not accompany me. Filled out PIR Form at Marrakesh Airport. Phoned every day to be told 'tomorrow' . Ended up going to the Airport on the Thursday and luggage was to arrive there at 23.00 on the Friday. Collected luggage on the Saturday and this was last day of holiday. Veuling want receipts for everything I had to buy. Unfortunately Marrakesh Markets do not provide receipts so I am out of pocket for sandals, toiletries and emergency clothing required for six days and two taxin trips to the airport! Surely there should be a daily allowance for passengers whose luggage you have lost and it should be an automatic payment and not the rigmarole that you put your passengers through to claim compensation.

### "I have no complaints"
Rome to Munich. We had no issues whatsoever. We limited ourselves to carry on luggage and my fear was that there would be some attempt to allege that our luggage was oversized or overweight and face luggage charges that exceeded the air fare. That was not the case. Very friendly staff and I have no complaints. It's an economy airline and if you keep that in mind and not have major airline expectations, you'll do just fine. For that matter, a major air line (United) was far less professional. United's flight delays caused us headaches, but Vueling provided a stellar performance.

### "I cannot fault Vueling at all"
We flew from Edinburgh to Rome on 24th September 2016 returning on 27th September 2016. After reading lots of negative reviews I was concerned about my booking, however I cannot fault Vueling at all. I need not have worried. Yes they are a budget airline and I'm sure just like any other budget airline they have times when things don't go according to plan and flights get delayed and even luggage lost, the big airlines also have these issues at times. Our flight to and from Rome went smoothly with no problems at all. Check in and boarding were straightforward and without any hassles or stresses. All staff that we came in contact with were pleasant and well mannered and made us feel welcome and answered any of our questions we had. I am writing this positive review as I feel people are very quick to write negative reviews but positive experiences go unsaid. Thank you Vueling for a pleasant flight and I will use the airline again.

### "very poor service"
London Gatwick to Palermo via Rome. I was nervous about booking an indirect flight to Palermo but was confident that a transit time of about 2 hours was sufficient. In the event the flight to Rome was about 1.30 mins late (no explanation given) and I had to run a long way through the terminal and was one of the last to board the Palermo flight. Wisely I had not checked in my bag or I would have missed the connection. I have no confidence that I would have received any help from Vueling if this was the case. The flight from London was not full and I was invited to sit in an empty safety exit row which is normally charged extra for. On the return I was in a horribly cramped normal seat not helped that the seats have recline which the 'kind' person in front decided to use despite the short duration. An argument broke out between two other passengers on the same issue which the crew did nothing to try to resolve. Very poor service and I am surprised this is a BA codeshare partner.

### "couldn't care less about you"
Lisbon to Palermo via Barcelona. This is the worst airline ever and I will not use them again. We were due to fly out of Lisbon on 16/09 and we get an email to say our flight has changed and we are now flying out of Lisbon on 19/09. I got onto their website and asked why, but had no reply so decided to go with the change as we didn't have any accommodation booked in Palermo. The flight was late leaving on the 19th so we only had 5 minutes to run from the arrival gate in Barcelona to the departure gate arriving just as they closed the gate. We were then made to feel like it was our fault we were late! We arrived in Palermo but our luggage did not! Surprise surprise - we checked with the hostess on the flight and voiced our concerns about making our connecting flight and were told 'not to worry as there was plenty of time to get the flight and our bags would be transferred' silly us for asking. Yes, we arrived in Palermo without clothes. We filled in a lost baggage form with the nice man in the lost and found area at the airport, but he said he really could not do anything, it was up to Vueling. To cut a long story short, they do not answer the phones or emails. I think it would be easier to talk to the Queen of England than talk to or get a response from Vueling. One would ask the question 'why are Vueling in business when their customer service doesn't answer it's customers' and even if you are fortunate to receive an answer at the end of your numerous attempts to communicate with them, only to be told 'yes your bags are lost' my only conclusion is that they couldn't care less about you, just your money. Sad but realistic. We don't expect to see our luggage again and sad because we had hand-picked special things to take back to our families - we can't get them again. Shame on you Vueling for spoiling people's experience on their holidays.

### "friendly and welcoming crew"
Alicante to Manchester. In short, friendly and welcoming crew, landing early at Manchester and a perfectly enjoyable flight. We arrived at the gate with one too many bags but we were allowed on with no extra charges. The menu on board was adequate, the gin and tonic packs of Bombay and Schweppes are very nice. The android app is really useful with mobile boarding passes. I have 2 more flights booked so please keep up the good work.

### "our seats were moved"
The flight to Cardiff from Barcelona was 50 minutes late, explanation, technical problems. No explanation. On the flight from Barcelona on 18th our seats were moved from the front of plane to back, reason given, using another aircraft. Lots of us had it happen. We waited on the Tarmac for an hour. Inflight I was 'interviewed' by the male flight attendant as to going to the toilet, he told me the plane was moving and so I should be in my seat. After a lengthy discussion he unlocked the toilet. The same chap when in charge of the food trolley kept lots of people in a queue behind him even though only 2 rows from emergency seats. The other crew were fine.

### "cannot praise Vueling enough"
Cardiff to Malaga with Vueling. Wife, myself and 6 year old daughter. Flight out from Cardiff left on time and pleasant flight down to Malaga. Return flight was delayed 6 hrs due to air-conditioning fault on plane at pushback. Vueling could not have been more helpful supplying food and drink vouchers and keeping us informed at all times. 3 weeks later I received 1200 euro compensation which was 400 euro per person. Cannot praise Vueling enough and do not understand all the bad reviews regarding customer service and wait for compensation.

### "either shape up or ship out"
Paris Orly to Barcelona. I've just spent over an hour and a half awaiting check in (and this is the expedited print your boarding pass line) and the ordeal is nowhere near to being finished. Two counter agents service of this line and customer service is totally non existent. I'm not sure how long this airline has been in existence but either they shape up or ship out since this won't cut it! For customers to be subjected to this level of poor service is unheard of today. I really do hope that something is done about this since Europe is far too progressive to accept this. However judging from the amount of bad reviews regarding this airline and the inability of anyone to do anything thus far about it just about sums it up!

### "breathtaking lack of customer care"
We flew for the first time with Vueling from Birmingham to Barcelona. Flight out was fine although with a 2 hour delay. Flight back was cancelled and Vueling did nothing to help just told us to complain, which we did but have only received a refund for the cancelled flight which does not cover the cost of getting back with an alternative carrier. So, an almost breathtaking lack of customer care or consideration. They change the contract, you pay the cost, what a business model that is!

### "I am 100% dissatisfied"
I am 100% dissatisfied with my short experience with Vueling Airlines flying from London to Paris. Not only have I lost my luggage in the span of a 45 minute flight but also approximately 15 other customers with me. After arriving in Paris I had to wait in a long line behind everyone else who lost their baggage and fill out a form. After reaching the front of the line the customer service representatives could not confirm any location or timing of return of the luggage. I was told to track my luggage through their website which was difficult to navigate. I have waited 24 hours and called to check the status of my bag and it is still unknown when I will get it back or if I will receive before my next flight. My next flight is booked with this airline but I will never book with this company again.

### "complete lack of communication within the airline"
Booked under British Airways but discovered that Vueling were operating the flight from Prague to Paris. BA need to sort this as I booked expecting one service and got a far below standard one instead. Flight was delayed due to late incoming flight. I needed to be in Paris for work the next morning and so needed to know if the flight was likely to be canceled. I asked (after 5 hours of delay) "has the flight taken off from Paris yet on its way here? and they couldn't tell me if the flight was in the air or still on the ground, they repeated "We don't know" which I found truly incredible and highlighted the lack of customer care and / or the complete lack of communication within the airline. I ended up rebooking with Air France and got to Paris eventually learning that that Vueling flight had been canceled at the last minute. I would have been stranded and missed work. Their lack of information, customer care and cancelling after a six hour delay (rather than doing it earlier allowing people to make alternative plans if needed) was absolutely ridiculous. This airline is trying to run with too few planes and too few staff and I would advise that you avoid at all costs unless you have two days to spare for each part of your outbound and inbound flights.

### "not supportive at all"
Had a Vueling flight booked from Amsterdam to Mykonos with a stop in Rome. Vueling delayed our first flight by 2 hours, causing us to miss their second flight. They were not supportive at all in rebooking our 2nd flight and lost our luggage in the process. We had to find our luggage and find a way to get ourselves to Mykonos. When I asked them for a refund on the flight they caused us to miss due to their own "operational issues" they just said sorry but we don't offer refunds and we can't help you. Don't fly with Vueling if you can help it. I saw the horror stories and should have listened.

### "would fly again with them"
We flew from Palma to Sevilla and Granada back to Palma and were nicely surprised with Vueling service. My wife got very anxious after reading the reviews about delayed/cancelled flights, lost luggage, poor service. For a short/no correspondence flight in Spain, it was fine; maybe it's different if you have a transfer and luggage can get lost. Of course you don't get free coffee or anything on board (you can survive 1.5 h on these conditions) but you get the free 20kg luggage per person. Seats could be bigger but for 1.5 h, there's no TV, wifi, it's a bit bare - but you can read maybe? Flights were on time or within 10 min of scheduled landings, cheap prices so very satisfied and to recommend in fact. Would fly again with them to/inside Spain.

### "the smallest legroom spaces"
Barcelona to Lisbon. We booked a British Airways flight which turned out to be Vueling Airline. Our flight was more than 5 hours delayed. Reason: plane is delayed from previous flight. Communication was very poor. Beside that they changed the gate 4 times (B, C, A, B). One of the smallest legroom spaces. Already my flight from Lisbon to Barcelina was 1 hour delayed and then we had to wait another 2 0min because ground staff wasn't ready.

### "One of the worst flights I had"
Venice to Paris. One of the worst flights I had booked on BA but flew on Vueling, and I express resentment to BA code sharing with an airline that is far below its standard - this was not my first experience flying Vueling on a BA booking. The flight departure is a mess and it took one hour to check in. Venice airport is terrible, absolutely unorganized. There were only 2 staff members manning the check in, and air terminal signage was misleading. The flight is of the no service type, not a drop of water is free, and a tea costs 2.60 Euro. But the worst is that, not to my preflight knowledge, we landed at Terminal 3 of CDG, the low-cost and leisure terminal. You need take a walk wih luggage to reach a train station, where a shuttle train will take you to T2 where transportation is available. There was no other flight using this terminal, we Vueling are the cheapest, but unbelievably it took some 40 minutes for the luggage to arrive. It is more than an hour after landing that I was able to board the airport bus to town. It is incredible that both check-in and arrival were delayed, some two hours are thus lost. I will never fly Vueling again.

### "well below expectation"
Manchester to Barcelona with Vueling. Even considering it's a 'budget airline' it was well below expectation. Both legs of my trip were delayed (90 minutes and 20 minutes - not the end of the world, but enough to affect my train connections / plans). Both planes were extremely dirty - crisps and sweet wrappers on the floor, gum on seats - I even noticed a couple of torn seats too. Staff tried hard, but were overworked. Obviously there was no complimentary drinks / food, which is to be expected for a budget airline.

### "Vueling were fantastic"
Rome to Barcelona. My wife had just left hospital in Rome after being taken ill on cruise ship. We had to meet a connecting flight for UK in Barcelona. We were desperate to return home after an horrendous weekend. Vueling Airlines were fantastic. We were particularly grateful for the assistance my wife received in bypassing check in and the gate queues. We got real VIP treatment. Well done to all staff involved.

### "customer service is horrendous"
The customer service is horrendous. I booked a return flight from London Gatwick to Bilbao for my wife and 2 kids on the 14 July. I immediately realized I had booked the wrong return date. I phoned them as soon as there office opened and the advised that I could cancel for a refund (of which I got email confirmation) and then you rebooked the return online. I was told the refund would take 10 days. That was almost 7 weeks ago. I have phoned them about 8 times chasing my money and each I get told that it has been processed and I just need to wait. I was also told that I can't speak to a supervisor or manager. They said if I fill out the online form that a supervisor will contact me - I'm still waiting. I have emailed twice. Once they replied that it is being dealt with, the other they said that as the flight wasn't delayed that I'm not due any compensation - what the hell, they obviously didn't even read my email as it was the refund for a ticket they cancelled that I am chasing. The ratings don't allow me to put down zero otherwise I would. The customer service is ridiculous, and management is cowardly for not dealing with real issues. To wait for 7 weeks to be refunded money is pathetic.

### "a good flight experience"
This was my first experience using Vueling Airlines flying from Manchester to Tenerife South. I chose this route and flight as it was the quickest option for me, I did not review Vueling prior to flying and I had no expectations other than to get from point A to point B. I had originally been booked to fly to Tenerife two days prior with Jet2 from Newcastle but had to delay due to my mother being taken to hospital. When all was well I assessed my options and chose this flight because nothing was available from Newcastle. It left Manchester at 11.10 which was possible to catch by using the first train of the day to Manchester Airport. The cost for the flight was quite reasonable given it was booked less than 24 hours prior, but certainly not the cheapest option that day. The option to book your seat onboard was also available for a fair price, which I did. Frustratingly you can not check in online for Vueling flights from Manchester. As I had hand luggage only, it meant I wasted a little time queuing just for a boarding pass. I was given the option to check my hand luggage in for free but declined. Vueling use Terminal 3 at Manchester. I like it, it is smaller and easier to navigate, but it seems distinctly business like. It was fairly busy and I waited by the windows to see our aircraft taxi in and follow it down to the gate prior to the gate number being announced. Boarding our A320 (EC-LVU) started row 15 rearwards first. However not many passengers had arrived at the gate so other passengers were soon invited forward. We boarded via an airbridge and were met by a purser who was very welcoming and smiling. I was seated in 7A. I had lots of space available for my bag in the storages and enough leg room for me (I am 6ft 2ins). The cabin looked a little older than its three years age, but it was comfortable. Once boarding was completed I thought we might be going, but it took an age to refuel for the trip so that wasted quite a bit of time. Captain made a PA in Spanish and English about our route and flight time (4hrs 9mins) and we left the airbridge around 25 minutes late. The flight itself was smooth, no intrusive announcements. The crew kept up a cheery and engaging rapport with the passengers despite the language and barrier, they all spoke English, but were not like some Spanish crews I have encountered in the past who keep it very much service orientated. Had some very nice views on the flight down. Would have been nice to have an update on our location but that's just me. The inflight service consisted of two bar services, but crew could be seen taking items to passengers by tray in between. Interestingly no tax or duty free was sold on the flight. Not that I wanted any, but very used to seeing this on holiday flights. It did mean there was no pushy sell, which made for a nicer journey. The aircraft was not fitted with WiFi, again a little disappointing as I had heard they do have WiFi, and I most likely would have used it. Toilet onboard at the front has not been restocked with toilet paper I found it annoying as it was not as if the crew were particularly busy on the flight to have the time to make a cursory check. We arrived into Tenerife around ten minutes ahead of schedule. I was in the apartment 40 minutes later. Overall a good flight experience. I would fly Vueling again.

### "waste of valuable time"
I flew from Zurich to Lisbon on the 24th August 2016 and there was an issue with the cockpit door. More than three hours later the issue was resolved. I flew them again on the 29th August from Zurich to Luton. Flight was on time but then we were on the runway for 1 hour only to return back because there was a technical issue. It's not all that cheap and an absolute waste of valuable time.

### "have never experienced a smaller seat"
Flew Barcelona to Palermo and return ten days later with Vueling Airlines. Chalk and cheese. First aircraft told it would be eight hours delayed at check in. Checked this again and it was confirmed. Nearly left the airport. Fortunately did not and went through to the gate as plane was only one hour delayed. Iberia who code shared said everything was ok but Vueling check in staff completely wrong. Plane took ages to load. Have never experienced a smaller seat. Broken arm rest with sharp edges. Pointed it out to staff. Just shrugged. Seat in front clearly leaning back and unable to be put properly upright. Others like it around plane. Far too much hand luggage allowed on board. A shambles. The return. A brand new or near new 320. New style seats. A sense of more room. Staff clearly happier to be on board and basically on time although still far too much hand luggage. Believe I have to fly them again soon as code share on a BA ticket. BA should find better partners.

### "no hard sell of duty free"
Alicante to Manchester. Short queue time, boarded quickly and departed on time. Good leg room. No "hard sell" of duty free or lottery tickets like some airlines. Smooth flight and early arrival at Manchester airport. 8 minutes from plane door opening to my exit from the airport. Brilliant and very happy.

### "complete failure from their side"
Brussels to Barcelona return with Vueling. Cancelled my flight last minute without any communication and put me on a flight 6 hours later. This flight 6 hours later had more then 3 hours delay. Vueling admitted that the July events were complete failure from their side and still they delay the pay out of compensation and even claim an extraordinary situation without specifying what it is. It's even two times more then 3 hours delay for one flight and of course on my way back also almost 3 hours delay. So 12 hours delay and still fighting for a tiny compensation of 250 euro.

### "inhumane to split a family"
We travelled as a family of 2 adults and 3 kids with Vueling from Paris to Venice. After check-in, they said the flight was overbooked and at the end only 4 persons in the family can fly. When we asked for help, staff said they were contractors for Vueling at CDG airport and no one actually worked for Vueling and our request was ignored. We had 2 young kids who were very tired after a long flight from US to Paris. At the end the family was split, I as the father must stay one day at CDG and my wife travelled with 3 kids. The kids were so disappointed so they cried. It was so inhumane to split a family on vacation. Why they did not offer compensation for single traveler to volunteer to give up one seat?

### "too expensive for the comfort and service"
Amsterdam to Naples with Vueling. Way too expensive for the comfort and service that we received. Extremely little space in the aircraft and a 2 hour delay. Staff was unfriendly and customer service is terrible. I've tried to contact them several times but all I got was information coming from a robotic voice. I won't fly with Vueling ever again.

### "be careful that BA means BA"
We thought we had booked British Airways as it said 'Thank you for Booking with British Airways' on the ticket but the ticket turned out to be flying with Veuling. The flight was overloaded and over 30 people were not allowed on the flight. Having paid for a 4pm flight on Saturday to arrive UK 5.30pm we were diverted via Barcelona overnight to arrive a jaded 9.30 the next day. I felt sorry for the front line staff in Florence who were chaotic but at the sharp end with some angry passengers, me among them. BA, despite their logo on the flight name, washed their hands of this and offered no help at all. Be careful that BA means BA - and avoid Vueling if at all possible.

### "over 1hr 30 mins of waiting"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Paris Orly to Ibiza in August 2016. 300m queue at the Vueling counter for check in at Orly airport. Over 1hr 30 mins of waiting. People having to cut the line to check in on time. Everyone loses. Spending my time posting this review so the company tries to improve. Shouldn't be too hard!

### "This is the worst airline"
Florence to London Gatwick. This is the worst airline with the worst customer services I have ever experienced. We queued up for 1.5hrs to bag drop, miraculously made it on the plane (half the people didn't), our luggage did not make it (nobody told us this, they just left us waiting at the carousel for an hour before figuring it out ourselves). One week later there is still no sign of our luggage. No compensation has been offered. Each day we are told it has been "found" (as if we should be grateful for that) but that they can not confirm when it will arrive. No apology even offered.

### "all flights were delayed"
All flights were delayed. When we finally got on the flight for Bilbao from Barcelona 3.5 hours later than scheduled things seemed ok. But an announcement made half way through the flight only in Spanish changed that. I did not understand, but apparently Bilbao airport was then closed and we would have to fly to another airport. The closing time of Bilbao airport I am sure was known by the airline before takeoff. We then had to take a bus from Vitoria for an hour, and I arrived 5 hours later than scheduled, at 2.30am. The return flight was no better. I had an extremely short connection time in Barcelona (45 minutes), 30 minutes of which were lost due to the typical delays and use of buses to disembark the plane (the reason that this was so frustrating is that Vueling had tried to sell me a 'priority seat' for a higher price to 'ensure I had enough time to reach my connecting flight'. When clearly, seating makes no difference at all). I was given the incorrect gate information by the flight attendant. The only reason I made the flight after running through the airport was because all Vueling flights were delayed. Though had I been any less physically able I would have missed it. In minor addition, all the windows are filthy. This is such an awful airline. It is not worth the stress or time to try and save money by flying with them.

### "numerous mixed messages"
I made the mistake of ignoring reviews like this and paid the price the hard way, just save the stress and pay the extra £50 to fly with someone else, probably BA. Both my outbound and return flights London Luton to Amsterdam were delayed 2+ hours. On the outbound trip we were forced to stand for nearly 1.5 hours in a queue and then in a stairwell, London Luton is also a horrific experience that should be avoided at all costs. Arrived 2 hours late in Amsterdam. My return trip was, if possible, even worse: the plane we were supposed to be on had a tyre problem. After numerous mixed messages (flight cancelled, flight going, flight cancelled, flight going) a different route's plane was sourced (they delayed that flight by 3 hours instantly) and we landed 3 hours late. Take note: Vueling do not make announcements, so if something goes wrong (delay, gate change etc.) they will not let you know. They won't call passengers, they won't give you updates. This caused a lot of panic and frustration which compounded what was already a stressful experience. To make it even more horrific, we all arrived after the last train to London from Luton Parkway. Cue mass panic and shared Ubers into the city at seriously high cost. Avoid.

### "generally this was a good flight"
Barcelona to Luton. Got Easyjet out to Barcelona for a long weekend, and used Vueling for the return. I expected mass hysteria and long delays. Staff were all courteous and attentive, flight was on time and even made time up in the air, yes the plane floor was a bit on the untidy side, a couple of sweets rolling around but generally this was a good flight, loads of leg room too by the way.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Lisbon to Cagliari via Barcelona. The worst airline I have flown. Late, appalling customer service and they seemingly lose as many bags as they deliver. We flew with Vueling over several routes during our three months in Europe and 3 out of 4 flights were delayed longer than 4 hours, with the 4th delayed 3 hrs. We missed one connecting flight due to the delayed first leg and were not able to continue on for 12 hrs. Our bags were lost for 14 days, with no email or phone responses in that time. Not once. I can't say enough about how frustrating our experience was. I am only giving one star for each category as the rating system won't enable me to give zero.

### "how terrible this airline is"
Amsterdam to Valencia. Flight delayed by 2 hours 40 minutes. There are no staff in the airport to speak to and no food or drinks vouchers. Just realised when looking at the other reviews how terrible this airline is, wish I knew before.

### "irate customers who had lost luggage"
Luton to Barcelona with Vueling Airlines. Delayed flight one hour. At airport baggage claim no indication of carousel to go to. Then after not finding luggage, a very long line of irate customers who had lost luggage. After 2 hour wait I was given a number to call. This number does not work. After 6 attempts the number tells me to list all my items lost and post it to the Vueling website! How do I list 23 kilos of luggage, clothes, important papers, and other items. Now I am stuck in Barcelona not able to visit any other places.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Barcelona to Moscow with Vueling Airlines. This is the worst airline I have flown with. Our flight was delayed. Once the plane did arrive it was not clean. The staff were quite indifferent to passengers. There was no food or even water offerred after an initial run just after take off. The tray table was gaffer taped to the seat. There was a patch on the seat. We waited on the Tarmac for a very long time without aircon. After arrival all our luggage 4 cases were missing took 48 hrs to be traced- one case they had no idea where it was! With no Russian it was hard. We had to go to the airport to claim baggage once it was found at our own expense. Have to say though that ground staff were friendly and wheelchair assistance was organised. Overall 4 out of 10 - fail - if only on actual flight it would be 0.

### "worst airline one can choose"
I wish I had checked Vueling Airlines visitors posts before, people are suffering big losses due to this airline and so have I. I lost 1 checked in baggage in the flight on 8th July and its been 20 days they haven't replied to even a single email of mine. Their customer service sucks big time, they don't entertain your calls or emails. I don't know if they have any staff or not. Our other flight from Paris to Barcelona got cancelled in the last hours, forget the compensation for our expenses they haven't even refunded the money of cancelled flight. And its been almost a month since this case. There is none to listen to our grievance and help us. This is the worst airline one can choose.

### "first and last time flying Vueling"
Barcelona to Milan. It was bad from start to finish! The outbound flight was delayed over an hour while we all stood in line and never did an agent say we were going to be delayed. Then when we did finally board the captain explained that the crew with the luggage were on strike. So then coming inbound we all head to claim our luggage, but there was no luggage. We waited an hour and 19 minutes before the first piece of luggage left the carousel! There were no agents around to give any information about our luggage. Yet we pay 35 euros for our luggage to arrive in a timely manner. I then go downstairs to ticketing to complain about this horrendous service, where I waited another hour, just to be told to write an email. I'm amazed that this company is still in business, no one has anything good to say about them. This was a first and last time flying with Vueling, I'd rather walk!

### "last time to fly on this airline"
Rome to Berlin. First the flight was delayed for an hour. We were supposed to take off at 13:00 not 13:55. My luggage was lost and they didn't give us any information where is it, not only for me for other passengers too. They said that the luggage wasn't on the plane and they don't know where it is. I am very disappointed. This is the last time to fly on this airline.

### "discovered every day numerous complaints"
Barcelona to Edinburgh. Long delays on both outward and return journeys No food or drink available on board outward journey Extremely uncomfortable seats. My luggage was lost on return journey and I was given a number to contact. This was a call centre where every day they told me my luggage had been traced and waiting to be put on a flight. After 2 weeks phoning someone told me that it probably hadn't been traced and they couldn't do anything. Every number or e mail I contacted gave me an automated response which told me to contact the lost luggage. The lost luggage number also told me they couldn't help. After looking at their Facebook page I discovered every day numerous complaints the same as mine going back for years, so obviously nothing is being done about them.

### "No explanations given"
Original flight delayed. Replacement flight boarded 1.5 hours late. Flight had not been cleaned and was full of trash. It was an old aircraft - flight cancelled after waiting 30 minutes. No explanations given. Had to wait 1 hour for airline staff to show at ticket office. He shouted all passengers had to go to a hotel. Not possible to get compensation nor discuss same. Asked to be put on earliest flight next day but was told it was full. However when I mentioned tickets were available online was informed by staff that this airline always overbooks heavily and no seats actually available.

### "flights were delayed or cancelled"
The flight from Beirut to Barcelona delay for 1 hour the plane was not clean but the worst was the flight back from Barcelona to Beirut, our flight was supposed to take of at 11pm, but this didn't happen and they kept delaying it without telling the reason and without determining a time for the delay. At 2am they told us that the flight will be at 6 am and they refuse to take us to a hotel, when in the airport I realized that 4 other Vueling flights were delayed or cancelled.

### "no customer service"
I took Vueling on two separate occasions and both occasions had issues. On the first occasion my flight was delayed by over 3 hours. On the second Vueling cancelled my flight with no compensation apart from an offer to refund my flight. They booked my subsequent flight for over 2 days from the planned date. What's worse is they didn't even reply to my feedback sent to their customer service but rather gave me a system generated - "your refund is being processed". I've flown a few budget airlines on a cross Europe trip, Vueling is the only airline to have issues and no customer service.

### "flew with a delay of 19 hours"
My flight in August 2015 was going to leave 03:25 in the morning from Athens to Barcelona. Once arrived at the gate I was informed the flight was delayed, however the reason why was not told. After waiting more than 4 hours it was possible to board the plane, just to leave it again after waiting for a long time inside of the aircraft. Due to technical difficulties, no spare parts on location etc and a head office that was difficult to reach I had to wait at the gate once again. At some point we were offered to go to a hotel for two hours, after which we would be able to board the plane and go to Barcelona. When we came back we were not able to board because the crew had to take a rest! Obviously this was not possible in the past 17 hours of waiting. Close to 21:00 we where able to board the plane, and we flew to Barcelona with a delay of 19 hours. Enough trouble and unreasonable excuses for a compensation (at least) right? While a couple of my fellow passengers managed to get a compensation, they ignored any request of mine or told be the handled according to European law. They even told me the weather was bad at Barcelona, nice try! Never again, I would advise anyone considering to not even try. At least they didn't lose my luggage!

### "never fly with Vueling again"
Nice to Palma de Mallorca via Rome. I cannot describe all problems with Vueling - delayed flight, missed my connecting flight, no organistion, no information, waiting, paying unexpected expenses, arguing, fighting for my rights, staff arrogance and rudeness - and in the end with 16 hours of delay in my final destination, my baggage didn't arrive. Now I will have to fight and argue with them on their website again for getting  my expenses back. I will never fly with Vueling again.

### "no word of apology from anyone"
We were flying home to London from Barcelona and found out that our flight was delayed for just under an hour - we later found out that this was due to an emergency at Luton Airport and nothing to do with the airline. However, boarding didn't start until 30 minutes after the posted time. The person at the gate apologised as we started boarding - first time there was an announcement as such. The plane then waited at the gate for at least another 1.5 hours and none of the crew members even bothered to tell us what was going on. When the passengers asked the crew, the captain gave an announcement as to why we were waiting (queue), but he didn't even apologise. Neither did the crew. When we started moving, there was no announcement either and several passengers were waiting in line for the toilet. En route to Luton and upon arrival, there was still no word of apology from anyone for a flight that was delayed for close to 3 hours. I am a seasoned traveller and I understand why there are delays beyond the control of the airline. However, the common decent and customer-centric thing to do is to inform the passengers and apologise. There were also many issues with checking in, but that would take too long to describe here. Never flying with Vueling ever again.

### "cancelled due to operational reasons"
Barcelona to Milan. Recent booking cancelled due to operational reasons? Phone calls took 5 hours 13 mins, (11 calls plus 9 cut off) to Vueling. Even one of their representatives said that she had trouble understanding and navigating Vueling website! Overcharged - refunded in part (yet to arrive) - problem on the actual email confirmation - long call and eventually got a new correct email - had to explain that turning up at the airport with a telephone assurance that all was OK - is not good enough for me. I print out everything - screen shot from my computer, showing email times/dates/sender etc - all confirmations. Eventually I got new flights, Having had to cancel my lengthy bus journeys to the airport completely, as my new times mean that the bus cannot arrive in time to check in. I have to drive and pay parking charges now. I had to change my hotel booking (with charges) and my car hire (no charges bless them). And thought for the day - not yet explained by Vueling "if Premium" members cannot get a seat because the flight is fully booked, then ring this number - minimum two people and you will get seats. How?

### "given no indication of problems"
Despite booking an Iberia flight, we were unfortunate enough to be placed on a Vueling flight from Rome to Manchester. We queued for over an hour to check in and were given no indication of problems which were to come. Immediately upon arrival at departure lounge we found out via social media that the flight was delayed two hours. We then found out departure would not be until 23.00 hours. We had been due to depart at 17.45. We were then told via social media that the plane was on its way. Then sent to a different gate and told that flight was now leaving at 21.45. Then told that crew were out of hours and a new crew had to be found. Then crew arrived and then no buses to aircraft. Finally boarded at 23.15 hours and that was the first time we saw anyone from the airline. A truly disastrous experience, and to top it all off, the leg room on their planes is the smallest we have encountered. We arrived in Manchester approximately 02.00 hours where we landed so far away from the terminal it took about half an hour to get to passport control. Needless to say we will never travel with this airline again. We also will not book an Iberia flight or British Airways flight as the majority of passengers on this flight thought they were travelling on a BA flight they had booked.

### "never fly BA or Vueling again"
After a fantastic holiday in Italy and Greece, we turned up at Rome airport only to find that the BA flight we had booked was being operated by Vueling. Despite the fact that we had a BA flight number and queued at the BA check in for over an hour, the rude staff proceeded to turn us away and sent us to check in with Vueling! After another hour in endless queues, we finally checked in and were sent to the gate. We then had our flight delayed hour after hour for over five hours until we finally boarded the worst aircraft you have ever seen. No legroom. Dirty, hot and smelly. No information from either BA or Vueling and no one to be found to help or apologise. I will never fly with BA or Vueling again. I will also never travel to Rome's appalling airport again either. Rude and unhelpful staff everywhere, totally disorganised and thoroughly dreadful.

### "terrible flight attendants"
The worst customer service I have experienced. I am a frequent flyer and use many different airlines. Check-in in Genoa, Italy, was a complete disaster. The gate attendants were disorganized, surly, rude, and inefficient. No eye contact whatsoever. Desks were opened 45 minutes before the flight was supposed to take off. Flight left over an hour late with no explanation whatsoever. Terrible flight attendants. Shockingly bad service from Vueling Airlines.

### "no legroom at all"
Luton to Amsterdam and our first experience with Vueling was not a great one. We booked with BA, and we're not aware it was Vueling until the end. Our flight from Luton was 2 hours late leaving, no explanation was given, in fact the captain spoke only once and so quietly you couldn't hear him. Outbound the seats were very tiny with absolutely no legroom at all, thankfully we were only in the air 50 minutes. Coming back, it was an hour late, again no explanation, just seemed par for the course with this lot. I personally would avoid travelling with them again if I could.

### "never fly with Veiling again"
Shocking airline with zero customer service. Held for 2 hours at the gate in Florence, with no information, no refreshment and no toilet facilities. About one third of the passengers bumped off the flight, then the rest of us received no baggage at Gatwick. A reason of "high winds" was given, yet all other airlines appeared to be leaving Florence without any problems. Zero response from Vueling on whereabouts of the luggage so far. Booked via BA so complained to them too, but given common ownership that is likely to be a waste of time. My family were distraught, and I will never fly with Vueling again.

### "above average service for a cheap price"
I flew with Vueling from Prague to Rome and back on their A320. After reading the reviews here I got quite nervous, but overall had a pleasant experience with Vueling. Most of the reviewers here expect to get a luxurious service on a cheap flight, but you pretty much get what you pay for. Our flight was on time, check-in and bagging was okay, customer service was pretty pleasant both on the ground and in flight. The seats are okay for short to medium flights and there is no inflight entertainment provided. The food and drink selection is pretty wide with some menu combinations available. All in all, I received slightly above average service for a cheap price so cannot complain that much. Personally, I would recommend Vueling to others based on this experience.

### "staff were pleasant and professional"
Flew from Bilbao to London Gatwick. Vueling is a low-cost airline and generally you get what you pay for: The queues are long and you are packed into a plane where the only option is expensive junk food. Having said that, the staff were pleasant and professional and the plane was fine. My objection is that I ended up with Vueling by booking a British Airways ticket for an Iberia codeshare that was operated by Vueling. It was a classic bait-and-switch. There was no priority check in for executive club members and I was refused entry to the lounge at Bilbao, being told that BA didn't grant access for Vueling passengers. As both airlines are owned by the same company, IAG, this is a little annoying.

### "mobile check-in is confusing"
Lisbon to Zurich with Vueling. Flight delayed and then cancelled. The flight next day delayed many times and then cancelled last minute when it was too late to book another flight. Then they failed to book hotel rooms for everyone, so some passengers had to share the room. Apparently they don't even have a plane to operate this regular flight. The outbound flight was operated by Wamos Air, and it was B747 which is a huge overkill for the amount of passengers. Their mobile check-in and seat choosing process is one of the most confusing that I've seen. They send emails saying "We attach the boarding passes" yet they don't - my tip, check-in from a desktop.

### "fairly average budget airline"
Flew Paris to Amsterdam via Barcelona. Fairly average budget airline experience with Vueling Airlines, with the exception of when one of the airport employees caused me to miss my first flight to Barcelona but was generous enough to give me a new flight free of change to compensate. No issues with the seats and cabin crew.

### "kind staff, clean plane"
Rome to Stuttgart with Vueling. Left on schedule in Rome and arrived on time in Stuttgart. Kind staff, clean plane and a perfect landing in medium weather. Despite negative opinions read before, satisfied with them and would take them next time also.

### "everything went smoothly"
My very first experience on Vueling Airlines was on 17 May with VY8831 from Paris CDG to Seville. After reading so many negative reviews, I resigned myself to expect delays but was pleasantly surprised - everything went smoothly and on schedule. Returning Seville to Paris CDG on 11 June with VY8832 and I was pleasantly surprised again - I was not made to pay the excess baggage fee despite being overweight by 2 kg. The thing about Vueling is that you should not have any high expectation. Also, be aware of the extremely tight legroom.

### "appalling customer service"
Absolutley appalling customer service. They lost 4 of our bags and have done absolutely nothing to assist us in finding them. We had to contact another airline and get them to help. One bag contained a wedding dress which we desperately tried to track and they told us to buy another one. We were lied to several times on the phone, and the system for lost luggage is appalling. After one week of waiting we received one bag of the four, despite making around 10 calls per day.

### "no information or assistance"
There were two flights with Vueling Airlines. Helsinki-Barcelona was 4 hours delayed. No information provided and no assistance in rearranging the missed connections. The seat space was the smallest I have experienced, impossible even to sit properly. There was no service or offers to buy beverages on the flight. The return flight was also delayed, two hours, with no information or assistance. I had to arrange a sleepover in Helsinki myself with my own money, as all transport to my home town had left. On this return flight, the seating was reasonable and service proper. The lack of assistance with missed connections was shocking though.

### "lack of personnel, poor service"
My first and surely my last experience with Vueling. Because of a strike, my flight from Paris to Rome was cancelled. First disappointment: it took me a whole morning (despite my attempts every 5 min) to reach the customer service. Second disappointment: arrival at the airport, I never saw such a queue in my flying life. The check in queue literally started at the entrance of the airport. And then the nightmare went on: lack of personnel, poor service, no explanation. Finally a take off with nearly one hour delay. I would not recommend this company.

### "had to push the customer service"
I would strongly encourage people to think twice before booking a flight with Vueling, unless they are planning a non-essential trip where they don't mind if it is cancelled at the last minute. My flight from Geneva to Barcelona was cancelled 4 hours before the flight. No other options were provided. The customer service over the phone was extremely unhelpful. I ended up finding my own way to Barcelona. There were no immediate or voluntary offers to refund my ticket. I had to push the customer service to give me a refund.

### "delayed without any explanation"
I booked a trip from Brussels to Barcelona for the weekend with Vueling Airlines. My flight to Barcelona was scheduled to leave Brussels Airport at 9.25 pm and reach Barcelona at 11.30. The flight was delayed twice without any explanation at all. The flight before us that was scheduled to leave around 6.30 still had not left by the time we were suppose to begin boarding. They sat on the plane for over an hour during this time. After repeatedly asking for information (along with many other travelers) we were told that we would be flying out after 2 am. We did not get into Barcelona until nearly 5 am at which point the only available transportation method was a 30 euro cab drive into the city. On the return flight, my original 3.30 pm departure was canceled and rescheduled for 6.40. Again, the flight was repeatedly delayed without any explanation, apology or information. After our third delay, the large crowd of travelers became very agitated and started asking questions of an Iberia worker that had informed us our flight would not leave until 11.20 pm. After pressure from the crowd, he made a phone call and we were finally allowed to board a plane at 10.40. This flight did not leave Barcelona until midnight, meaning we sat on the runway for over an hour. I missed my train home upon arrival in Barcelona and was again forced to take a taxi. I understand that this is a budget airline, but it was the absolute worse traveling experience I have had.

### "I have lost all hope in them"
Luton to Barcelona with Vueling. My recommendation - do not use this airline. After years of monthly business flights from Barcelona I have lost all hope in them. Apart from the bad service onboard, the smallest and most uncomfortable seats of any airline in Europe, the worst things happen when they cancel or delay your flight (which happens quite often). They have almost no personal in airports outside of their hub in Barcelona and when things go wrong the passengers are left with no information nor service during hours. I have had the same scenario in Paris Orly, Lyon and London Luton airports. This company is a disgrace and if you have another option to fly, don't go Vueling.

### "left with no information"
Barcelona to Sevilla with Vueling. We have been waiting at the Barcelona aiport since 3pm (it is now 1am) to board a flight that was suppose to leave 7.45pm. We got notice around 4pm from the electronic screens that the flight had been delayed. At around 9pm they informed us that it would be delayed another 2 hours. We are now sitting waiting for our luggage. Left with no information about what to do and all they have told us is that they are waiting for more crew to come.

### "No information. No updates"
Still in Rome after a five hour delay. No information. No updates. Constant change of flight departure times. Rude staff. Only explanation is 'operational problems'. Finally provided us with a free lunch but needed to leave the terminal to get it, going past customs twice. Hopefully the last time I need to use Vueling Airlines.

### "not be travelling them again"
It is currently 1:55am UK time and we are sat on the Vueling plane which was meant to depart for Alicante at 20:55pm. With little indication to what has happened to cause such a delay. Kind of sums it all up really. Terrible airline and terrible service. Will definitely not be travelling with them again.

### "Vueling - the new Ryanair"
Amsterdam to Barcelona with Vueling. They are the new Ryanair. Been flying with Vueling 2-3 times a week for 7 months. They are consistently late 1h plus. The never apologize for delays. The staff are rude (many exceptions). Hand luggage is confiscated randomly. Plane are without air conditioning when boarding resulting in extreme cabin temperature. Food is bad. During flight they keep the toilets locked even though there is no turbulence. Just are consistently bad experience. I will avoid in the future.

### "delay of nearly 9 hours"
I booked with Vueling Airlines on a flight from Manchester to Alicante on 21 June 2016. I was unable to check in online and arranged to be at the airport in plenty of time. We checked our luggage in and then heard whispers that there might be a flight delay. No-one at the desk could give us any information as to how long this might be and the reason for it. Our flight was due to leave at 16.15pm and by 7pm tempers were short. We were issued with a meal ticket and told we would leave at 22.00. This was then put back to midnight. We finally took off at 1am. A delay of nearly 9 hours. We felt sick and very tired and incurred the cost of a 40 euro taxi ride to our destination. Never again. The airline sent an e-mail apologising for the delay and asking me to fill in a questionnaire. Can you believe that the questions were in Spanish. Just another sign of their ineptitude. An airline to be avoided.

### "customer service is the worst "
London Gatwick to Florence. couple of weeks prior to our trip, we received an email letting us know that our flight was changed by 2 hours. This wasn’t our plan: we would have never booked these tickets in the first place since this meant we would land in Florence near midnight which is very late. The evening of the flight, it was again delayed 3 times before being cancelled at 10:30pm. We were told by the airport staff to go to a nearby hotel (after going throught custom again and picking up our bags of course). When we got there, the staff couldn’t help us out because all the rooms were booked by passengers of another cancelled flight. The airport staff arranged hotels rooms in differents hotels all around the airport for the passengers. Some went to bed past 1am. During that whole ordeal, no Vueling staff were present to help us or guide us. Our new flight was due to leave at 9am the next day but got delayed again 3 times before being diverted to Bologna (we learned this via text, not via the Vueling staff on hand). Once we got to Bologna, our luggage was left behind in London. At this point we thought nothing else could go wrong - how foolish of us. Vueling organised a bus from Bologna to the Florence airport. Once we got to Florence, we were told that our bags were on a flight and were to land in Florence in about an hour so we decided to wait. That plane, also a Vueling flight, got delayed twice  and then diverted to Pisa. We got our luggages back a day later. In what world is that acceptable? Now we are asking Vueling for a refund  and Vueling is ignoring our emails. Still no comeback on our email sent 2 weeks ago. Customer service is the worst to say the least. T

### "I won't be flying them again"
Alicante to Amsterdam with Vueling. In the past I have defended this company based on previous experience of multiple flights without issues. Vueling seem to have expanded to quite a few new routes in the past 18 months, they now even fly from Amsterdam to London and from Liverpool to Basel for example. Customer service seems to have suffered as a result. Arrived at ALC Alicante airport for my flight back to Amsterdam on VY1376 and after waiting in a very long check in queue discovered the flight was delayed. It happens of course so no problem. I waited at the gate for 3 hours for the inbound flight to arrive from Amsterdam. It arrived at 20:23 (scheduled arrival at 17:50) according to flightradar24. Turnaround was slow so it was around 2130 before we were actually seated on the aircraft. They made us stand in the air bridge for at least 25 minutes. After being seated for 20 minutes the pilot announced a 35 minute engine start delay due to ATC issues. An hour passed. No info from the pilot. Passengers getting restless and asking the FA’s for an update. Captain says 10 more minutes due to a paperwork issue. This farce then went on for about another hour before the captain mentioned crew hours. After 10 more minutes the captain announced the flight is cancelled due to crew hours. Everyone started disembarking. That is when everything went a bit wrong. No-one had become in any way aggressive or threatening to the crew but there were 4 armed Garda National at the door of the aircraft. Don’t know if that is standard procedure but to me it seemed a bit OTT. They called the cops but no-one to direct people and they did not even make any announcement on the plane what to do. We eventually found out to go back through security to the Vueling ticket desk in the terminal. Only 1 Vueling staff member to try to deal with over 100 people. It was well past midnight. No information, didn’t even speak to the Vueling agent as I waited over an hour and the queue was not abating. Found out that there was no hotels – apparently all hotels in the Alicante area were fully booked (which I doubt). No meal / refreshment vouchers offered although by that time mostly everything was closed anyway. I eventually found out from another passenger that if I went to the Iberia desk they would give me a taxi voucher although I had no hotel to take the taxi too. I felt like they just abandoned the whole plane to sleep in the airport unless you had somewhere to go. The flew me from Valencia the next day after a 2 hour taxi ride and even that flight was delayed 2 hrs. Got home 30 hours after I left, completely exhausted. Some holiday. Submitting complaints on their webform is a nightmare too. It took me hours and multiple tries before it would work. Even that has delays. By the way my flight to ALC was also delayed over an hour and 3 hours the last time. They are not even that cheap - paid €180 for the flight. They also systematically lie about delays. They post false ETD's when they know the inbound aircraft has not even left it's original destination. They seem to forget that you can track aircraft in real time on flight radar so I knew exactly when the inbound would actually arrive. Only fly them if you are prepared to fight for a hotel when cancelled and be systematically delayed. I won't be flying them again.

### "terribly unfriendly staff"
Rome to Ibiza with Vueling. Terribly unfriendly staff on the airplane and even though there was lots of space still I the compartments I was forced to give my bag into cargo. We were already 40 minutes delayed and then we had to wait for our luggage again at the airport.

### "no information at all"
Arrived at airport to check in at 4.30 for a 6.15 fight back to the UK. Checked in luggage, went through to duty free and then to departure gate when it came up on the board, we went to the departure gate as per board but no flight details, no ground staff and no airplane. Then no information at all on what was happening. Another passenger said they had received an email at 3.45 saying the flight had been cancelled but thought it was a joke. Why if Vueling had sent out emails at 3.45 saying the flight had been cancelled let us check in and not inform airport staff? No Vueling representative came to let us know what was going on, passengers just left in the departure lounge. Eventually we were told a bigger plane was coming to take passengers from ours and other cancelled Vueling flights and this would depart at 8.10. Again no information when it did not happen. Eventually at 9pm we were taken to a chartered plane from Iberia Airlines, (very old, still had ashtrays in the arm rests, seats stained) and sat on there until 11pm. Glad to be on our way home but the best was yet to come. We arrived at Gatwick at midnight and sat for an hour and a half at the carousel waiting for our luggage, finally we are told that none of the luggage had been loaded onto the plane and it was still in Barcelona. Had to wait another hour in the queue to fill out a lost luggage form. Two days later still no news. We booked through British Airways expecting a decent flight and service, not some bucket flight. Contacted British Airways to speak to someone to complain and an automated message says that they are dealing with a backlog of complaints and can't talk to you but register the complaint online. Their website advises you to claim for delays on your travel insurance. Looking at reviews now, I wish I had taken notice but thought that these things happen sometimes, however it appears they happen all the time on this airline. Please avoid booking with both BA and Vueling in future. Its really not worth it.

### "cancelled with no explanation"
I booked for a 7am flight to Granada from Barcelona. We woke up early, checked in on mobile, and went to the gate. It was cancelled with no explanation. They just sent us to the ticket counter where we waited in a line that went 300 meters and only 3 people working at the time. We already rented a car online in Granada and had a whole plan for the day, but now it's ruined. Do not use this airline unless you like standing in lines and getting your plans ruined.

### "barely provided any information"
Vueling Airlines cancelled our flight with less than an hour before departure and provided no information, I had to find out about the cancellation via the departure board. There were no airline staff on site until half an hour later, and when they came they barely provided any information. We were told we were to be put on a flight that was supposed to leave at 8.10, we did not get on the plane until 8.45 and did not take off until 11.00 pm. This was an overall nightmare experience where I was basically kept in the dark about anything that was going on. The lack of communication was absolutely absurd and no way to treat customers.

### "no explanation or apology was offered"
Another unpleasant flight with Vueling from London Gatwick to Barcelona. It started off with an announced 45 minute delay some three hours before the scheduled time. As seems to be the habit with Vueling, boarding only started when it was already time to depart. No explanation or apology was offered. Once on the plane, the cabin staff rushed everybody to please get to their seats quickly in order to minimise the delay. Everybody complied only to then find nothing happening for almost another hour. No engine start, no air conditioning, no water provided and once again no explanations or apologies. After more than half an hour waiting in a hot cabin, a few additional passengers came trickling in, then later some more. So a passenger behind me asked a flight attendant what the heck was going on and what or who we were waiting for. The answer was barked back at him rudely, saying we were waiting to pick up more stranded passengers from other flights Vueling had messed up. He then ridiculed the complaint saying it wasn't in the airline's interest either to have the plane sitting around idle and we weren't doing this for fun. Again not a trace of an apology or even comprehension that the airline might be failing customer expectations. Ultimately we arrived in Barcelona after midnight which left most public transport options unavailable and most passengers were forced to take expensive taxis home. The only apologies ever offered were part of the arrival announcement and rambled quickly into the PA mic. Tight seat spacing, the limited choice of reasonable quality food and drinks and the complete lack of entertainment or connectivity options were as usual on Vueling, special observations. When in control of the booking, I'd prefer almost any other low cost carrier over this one.

### "constantly changing information"
Vueling Airlines flight 7828 from Barcelona to London Gatwick. Still delayed with no concrete information. Constantly changing information from staff who have since abandoned gate. Still don't know if and when we will leave. They cancelled the earlier flight and claim that both flights will be accommodated on delayed 19.30 flight 7828. Rumours of unassigned seating. Scrum already developed at gate with no information when we'll leave. Ironically, the gate info sign still says boarding at 18.57. It is currently 19.44. If they had provided proper Information to passengers we could have made alternative arrangements. Airport sweltering with crowd at gate.

### "no explanation was provided"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Barcelona to Malaga. Starting with the check-in process, everything was disorganized and frustrating. There are no kiosks available for passengers not checking baggage. We waited in a 45 minute line to learn that we were on standby, despite purchasing relatively expensive seats and showing up on time. No explanation was provided for why we were on standby. Customer representatives at check-in and the boarding gate were all difficult - I'm sure they receive a constant stream of complaints, so it's hard to blame them. The company is very poorly run. The cherry on top: my seat had a big stain and my husband's seat flap had a wad of freshly chewed gum in it. Don't do it, just don't.

### "flight was already delayed"
Avoid if you want to have a normal trip. Booked to fly from Paris to Rome. Gate was reassigned 3 times, luggage belt broken at check-in so I had to go back 3 times to attempt to check in my bags. Normally this would be a big deal - but the flight was already delayed by 30 minutes (better than the 1 hr of my last flight with them) so I had an extra 30 minutes to keep bringing my bag back to them. If you are a broke student or someone who has the travel flexibility to spend hours at the airport, then maybe this airline is for you. For the rest of us who expect air travel to be an efficient method of travel, go with a different, more expensive airline.

### "absolutely zero issues"
So after reading the reviews needless to say I was up all night and already planning for what could go wrong. But have to say that was as smooth as anything you'll get from a budget airline. Check in was easy, staff were friendly, boarded on time, left close enough to on time and arrived at destination on time and collected luggage on time. Absolutely zero issues and miles better than easyJet. Seems like Veuling struggle in the UK but seem ok elsewhere in Europe. Would happily try them again before a few of the other budget airlines.

### "information has been scarce"
Flew from Stockholm to Ibiza via Barcelona. Its 4am and I am sitting in Barcelona airport waiting for a flight which had been delayed 8 hours and is heading for a 12 hour delay. Throughout this delay information has been scarce and what we have been told is misleading with gate information changing every few hours. We have not been offered any food or drink as compensation and there are children and older people waiting for the flight. Finally some staff arrived to help but no one from Vueling, the flight is operated by Vueling for Iberia and the Iberia staff were helpful and seemed equally frustrated as all of the passengers. An awful experience.

### "flight was then cancelled"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Birmingham to Barcelona. An initial 30 minute delay before being told to proceed to the boarding gate, when about to board the flight encountered a further delay and all passengers were sent back to the lounge, the flight was then cancelled. Another flight was arranged for 6am the next morning, crew turned up late so we were unable to board until 6.30am, the pilot announced that the flight had arrived late into Birmingham so they were required to go to a hotel and have a good rest. The aircraft had been visible for all to see when initially boarding the flight for the original scheduled slot. Passengers who had checked in luggage were all then made to leave the aircraft and identify their luggage on the tarmac besides the aircraft. No seatbelt check was done and sleeping passengers were left without their seatbelts for take off. I would absolutely not book any flight with this airline again.

### "all cabin bags were checked for size"
I was worried about using Vueling after reading previous reviews but the flight time was good so we went ahead. I pre-booked seats on row 9, and as we were flying from Edinburgh to Rome for 6 nights we both took cabin luggage only. You can also take a small bag into the cabin we found out at the airport so that worked out well. The flight was boarded using rear and front steps so everyone was seated quickly. Be aware that all cabin bags were checked for size and those that were too big were put in the hold. The flight was 35 minutes late taking off but made up time and arrived in Rome 20 minutes late. We had enough legroom, there was plenty of space in the overhead lockers, the seats were OK comfort wise, there was a limited selection of food available and the staff were pleasant. We had no complaints regarding this flight.

### "unorganised and dysfunctional"
London Luton to Barcelona with Vueling. I was due to fly to Barcelona for the weekend Sona festival. Vueling delayed our flight for over 7 hours and then cancelled. I was told we'd be on the next flight but we were put on the third flight out only to have another 6 hour delay and then cancellation. My whole holiday weekend was spent in Luton airport thanks to Vueling. No help, no refreshments, no accomadation. Told we'd be reimbursed for our flights but nothing else - angry is an understatement. I'd never use this airline again - unorganised and dysfunctional.

### "I won't be repeating the experience"
Birmingham to Barcelona with Vueling for a long weekend. The outbound flight was delayed for 1.5 hours and the inbound leg for 3.5 hours, part of which was spent on board the plane waiting for a fresh slot. Despite the long wait at Barcelona the food trolley was not fully stocked. The seat pitch is very limited as might be expected from a low cost airline and the staff did not appear well trained. This is the only direct flight from Birmingham but as much as I love Barcelona I won't be repeating the experience as the flights spoilt the trip.

### "lack of respect for the customer"
My Vueling Airlines flight from Barcelona-Genoa (1.30 h flight) was delayed more than 9 hours, without any proper information or assistance. Complete lack of respect for the customer, airline to absolutely avoid.

### "10 hours of delays"
Ibiza to Barcelona. I highly recommend going with Vueling if you want to wait for 10 hours of delays. The flight was cancelled when we arrived to the airport and they sent us a message to say they will move us to the next available flight, which was 5 hours later. Then that flight was delayed for another 2 hours. I can't think of anything more enjoyable than waiting in baggage claim at the airport and checking Vueling website to update the flight status by ourselves because no one gave us detailed information. We lost one day to visit Barcelona..

### "service just not good enough"
Malaga to Palma de Mallorca and we gave Vueling another chance because they are the only airline which flies this route at reasonable times of day - a mistake. Within 15 minutes of reaching the airport my husband received a text to advise of a flight delay, but no indication of how long a delay. At the airport there was no fast bag drop desk for those who had checked in online which defeats the object of checking in in advance. The check-in operator said the delay was "estimated" to be 1.5 hours - it turned out to be 2 hrs 20 mins. Passengers were given no less than 5 diffferent departure gates before the flight finally boarded, absolute chaos. The flight is only an hour in duration but there was not even a single refreshments service offered. At least the return flight was on time although once again there was no fast bag drop, and when we arrived only one check in desk was open for a full flight. We queued for 40 minutes and just as we were checking in, one more desk was opened. This kind of service is just not good enough.

### "zero communication / updates from crew"
Amsterdam to London with Vueling. Massive delay for the plane arrived. Then even after boarding we were just left sitting in the plane. There was zero communication / updates from the crew for 1:30h. Then the usual excuses - weather and strikes, which didn't seem to affect any other airlines. First and last time for me.

### "cheap quality and service"
Naples to Madrid via Barcelona with Vueling Airlines. The airline seemed so unprofessional. Upon checking in, I was told that with a US passport, I would need a visa in order to travel from Italy to Spain. The duration of my stay was only 4 nights. Then upon arriving, despite the cramped seating on the plane, I was happy to just get my luggage. After waiting about an hour for my luggage, they were still nowhere to be seen. I approach the employee at the customer service desk, telling them that both my suitcases are not here, they stated "oh then it must be lost somewhere". I was given a the PIR and told to go home and wait. After a whole day, I called the airline and it took 5 calls and 30 minutes of waiting before I was connected to a representative. They were less than helpful. I told them the situation and they simply told me your suitcases are still lost, but you'll get it soon. How can you tell me when I will receive something, but have no idea where it is? I would not recommend this airline at all. The employees seems to have no knowledge of the basics. Also it is considered a cheaper airline to fly with, but in my opinion the only thing cheap about this company is the quality and service they offer to their clients.

### "cabin staff are very friendly"
I have recently tried Vueling from Luton to Amsterdam and have found them to be good value. The cabin staff are very friendly, the plane clean and the check in staff helpful and not too officious. That said there is no on-line check in at either Luton or Amsterdam meaning a queue (so allow extra time) and watch the weight restriction on cabin bags (not always checked). The check in closeS quite close to the flight time and the gates close 10 mins before departure which has saved the day. The seat legroom is not great so if you are tall then its worth an upgrade to an exit row seat.

### "every single bag was left in Paris"
Vueling Airlines flight from Paris Orly to Florence began boarding late, while the line grew throughout the terminal. When we finally boarded, we were subjected to another hour, if not more, of waiting before take off. When we asked a flight attendant what was going on, she said we were waiting for late passengers. Last time I checked, airlines did not delay flights and inconvenience their passengers aboard the plane just for a few late passengers. Next, we found out that the real problem was "unbalanced weight on the plane". The flight attendants then proceeded to randomly pick people to move from their seats, to different parts of the plane to "balance the weight of the plane". After take off, we found out that half the passengers that were supposed to be on the same flight as us, we're not let on, due to the "weight of the plane issues". Next, we arrived at our destination only to find out (after more than 20 min of more waiting), that every single bag was left in Paris (where we took off). The employees informed us that we all had to wait in line in the lost and found line and fill out forms for each and every bag that Vueling airlines left behind. The whole process of filling out forms and waiting in line to fill out a lost bag report took us more than hour. We posed questions to the airport employees about why they were left behind, why didn't they tell us sooner, when will we get them here, etc, and all they wouldn't reply in answer to us was "We don't know". The airline has yet to contact us about approximately when the bags will get to us. Never again will I fly with Vueling airline.

### "gives no useful information"
Flew from Santiago de Compostela to Paris Orly via Barcelona. Exactly as the other 2 most recent reviews. First flight delayed 1.5 hours with no explanation which made for anxiety about missing the connecting flight. They unloaded us onto a bus on the middle of the Tarmac in Barcelona for the Terminal which took extra time - then ran to the next flight, which ended up arriving late as well. They board filling the back first, which was unusual. Then they lost my luggage and after living out of a backpack for 25 days, I had nothing at all. Had filed a report at Orly - none of the contact information for customer services online put me in touch with an actual person and their lost luggage Internet site gives no useful information about when your bag might actually arrive. Bag lost 3pm yesterday. Still waiting and unable to reach anyone at Vueling the next day.

### "not care about customer service"
I flew on a Vueling flight last week from Florence to Paris, and because of a technical issue with the plane we had to be bussed to the Pisa airport to board a separate aircraft. This in itself was inconvenient but could be unavoidable on any airlines- at least they got us to our destination in a somewhat reasonable timeframe (5 hours late). What was unacceptable was the lack of information given to passengers at any point in the process - I only knew we were boarding a bus to Pisa because I went up to the counter to ask; no general announcement was ever made. Once we arrived to the Pisa airport, there was no one waiting to tell us what to do and our flight was not listed on the departures board, meaning that all of us were just standing in the middle of the airport confused and distressed. After an announcement was finally made about which gate to stand at, we waited for another half an hour before boarding when again, no general announcement was ever made about the timing. Other airlines I've used have automatically given either small vouchers or at least free snacks during major delays like this - Vueling offered us nothing, even though this delay meant that we landed in Paris after most restaurants were closed for dinner. This lack of compensation combined with the lack of timely information was disappointing. Vueling offers cheap flights but clearly does not care about customer service or loyalty - I would be very hesitant to travel with them again in the future.

### "avoid the hassle by avoiding Vueling"
A terrible experience with Vueling Airlines. We were initially booked onto a 7.10am flight from Rome to London Gatwick. This then changed to 12.30pm with no explanation. Then on the day, our flight departure time mysteriously changed from 12.30pm to 4.00pm with no announcement and again no explanation. When we (and other passengers) went back to the Vueling Airlines ticket desk (the wrong way through security and passport control) for an explanation, the Vueling Airlines staff were very rude, defensive, and unhelpful. They initially declined to give us food vouchers (which they must give if flights are over 3 hours late), but eventually gave in. Vueling staff then instructed us to go to a gate at the airport and wait for a Vueling representative, but (surprise surprise) no one turned up. Everyone on the flight was so angry. When we eventually boarded and I queried the delay, the man was short with me and told us “French air traffic control issues” – however this was the only major delay from Rome FCO airport, no other flights appeared to be affected –so why was only Vueling nearly 4 hours late? In the end, we landed in London Gatwick at 6pm instead of 2.25pm. Afterwards, we read terrible reviews about this airline – many other people have had terrible experiences. The plane is cramped (more so than Ryanair – my 6” boyfriend couldn’t fit his legs in the seats), everything is cheap, and staff are rude. Just avoid the hassle by avoiding Vueling.

### "nothing particularly spectacular"
I used Vueling twice, once from Barcelona to Naples and then from Florence to Berlin. Both times the service and the flights were what you'd except from an economy airline, meaning there was nothing particularly spectacular about the flights but they weren't bad either and they got us from point A to point B just fine. We only had carry-on luggage, which they didn't really weigh to make sure it was 10kg or under. Both flights arrived mostly on time (the second one was delayed by 20 min or so) and the staff was cordial enough for the short time we got to interact with them. Overall Vueling Airlines is good value for the money.

### "service was zero"
Experience was just terrible. Flight from Brussels to Barcelona was canceled without any previous notification. On arrival at airport there was no Vueling service and I was only provided a phone number at an information desk where nobody answered and my call was just disconnected. Service was zero and I was not able to get any option or solution for the cancellation (nobody was there and I couldn't reach anybody). I just had to buy a new ticket from other company. After 6 hours I have not been able yet to reach anybody at Vueling Customer Service.

### "never use this airline again"
London Gatwick to Banjul via Barcelona with Vueling. We were travelling to visit family in West Africa together with our 7 year old child for 2 weeks. Our luggage never arrived and was scheduled to be delivered on the same day as our return flight. What a joke to have to claim your baggage so that you can check in to go back. No information was given to us on the whereabouts of our luggage before our return date. No customer service. The service on board is horrible. In addition, on our return we were not issued boarding passes for our connection flight. We were told they would be issued in transit at a dedicated desk. At Barcelona airport transit we were refused access and we were forced to go through custom, exit and go to the check in desk. I will never use this airline again.

### "very poor and below standard"
I arranged to travel from Shanghai to Barcelona on 6 May 2015 to meet my wife. My flight from London was with British Airways then connecting to Barcelona from Heathrow with Vueling. I booked this using the Helloworld website. When I went to check into my flight at Shanghai airport on Sunday 8 May, British Airways were not able to provide me with a Vueling Boarding pass - I was told to go to travel connections for my boarding pass I went to travel connections and they told me my boarding pass was only available at the gate. The gate wasn't announced until 5.40pm for a 6.25pm flight - I arrived at the gate at 5.50pm - got through via a queue to the desk just before 6pm. Vueling were very rude to me, told me to wait as they needed to serve everyone else in the queue and then print me a boarding pass as it was complex and time consuming. I waited at the desk for all the passengers to board and was rushed through. My bags never arrived in Barcelona. Vueling lost and found in Barcelona were slack and clueless as to where my bags were. I rang Vueling on several occasions to locate my bags - I could not get through to their call centre, my bags turned up at my hotel at 11pm on Tuesday 10/5. I am a platinum and gold member on various airlines and have travelled for over 20 years, I found this airlines procedures very poor and below standard when it came to customer care especially at the gate and in the lost and found baggage area.

### "both flights were late"
London to Barcelona return with Vueling. Both the outbound and return flights were late - both times because the cabin crew were late. Had to find this out from other delayed passengers as neither explanation nor apology was given. Would definitely avoid in the future. An unpleasant start and end to an otherwise pleasant stay in Barcelona.

### "not something I'll pay for again"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Barcelona to Brussels. I'm rather tall with 199 cm but it is the first time I could not physically fit in a seat at all. Utterly impossible. I know I can't expect the same level of comfort as someone of 1.75 m but this was ridiculous. I don't really have any other complaints as I can't expect too much of a budget airline on a flight of a couple of hours but not being able to sit as a normal person for 2 hours and the cabin crew slamming their cart into my knees (as the only place I could put my legs was the aisle) is not something I'll pay for again.

### "a tale of two halves"
Cardiff to Barcelona return with Vueling. Definitely a tale of two halves. The outward flight was about as good as it gets for low cost airline. Quick and easy check-in, fast passage through security and walked straight onto plane when boarding. Plane left early and landed early. Staff were pleasant and even the coffee was reasonable. The plane was a nearly new A320 with the thinner style seats which for a two hour flight were perfectly adequate. The only slight annoyance was having to be bussed to the terminal on landing and having to wait 30 minutes for our bags. All-in-all pretty good. Now for the not so good return flight. On a Bank Holiday Sunday the check-in queues at BCN were horrendous as was security but I suppose that's the chance you take. Not surprisingly given past experience with Vueling the flight was late. Then we had to be bussed half way around the airport just to get on the plane. The plane was a six year old A320 which had leather seats. That's were the good news ends. The leg room was appalling even for me at 1.77m. Quite possibly the most uncomfortable flight I have ever had. It didn't help that the cabin temperature was hot either. The flight landed at CWL thirty minutes late which by Vueling standards is on-time. These flights were a definite improvement on previous adventures with Vueling and we will still use them but only because they are the only ones to fly from CWL to BCN.

### "very inconsistent service"
Milan Malpensa to Barcelona with Vueling. Very inconsistent service. Usually quite satisfied by the price value proposition, but ground services are subpar. I experienced this at Milan today as I wished to advance my 9pm flight to 5:30pm. I arrived at the airport in due time to advance the ticket, as the app would not let me do it, but there was only 1 agent for the whole airport and shared with other airlines - so I wasted the check-in window in the queue and no new ticket could be issued. No one cares, you are on your own. So as long as everything goes as planned and your are willing to pay extra to travel in decent conditions it's fine, as soon as you need assistance or your plans change, well good luck.

### "experience was brilliant"
Cardiff to Palma, and having read very negative reviews, I was very worried. I need not have. The experience was brilliant. The check in procedure was efficient and the female staff member extremely pleasant and helpful. My check in case was slightly over weight, but she did not charge extra - she noticed I would be celebrating my birthday while away and wished me a happy birthday! Boarding was easy and the plane left on time. The cabin was clean and the seats very comfy. The cabin crew were very pleasant and very smart. On arrival at Palma the luggage was very quickly ready for collection. I cannot praise this airline enough, and am looking forward to flying with them again.

### "very poor overall"
Frankfurt to Malaga via Barcelona, and very poor overall. Aircraft old and filthy, crew were arguing loudly amongst themselves in front of passengers. Very poor design of seat with limited space. Unable to even read the inflight magazine. Flight from Franfurt delayed almost an hour and flight from Barcelona also delayed over an hour. Asked at the transit desk if they could reseat me 4 hours prior to departure and was told a flat no. I asked why and apparently the company do not permit seat changed. What utter rubbish.

### "pleased by the experience"
Granada to Barcelona with Vueling, very surprised and pleased by the experience. Every personal contact was enjoyable and the cabin crew actively assisted passengers with hand luggage. Aircraft was late in arriving but due to efficient handling, we left on time. The crew was smiley and helpful and I was very impressed by everything except the seat pitch which was just barely survivable for an hour.

### "service was polite and efficient"
I've just travelled from LGW to BIO and back on Vueling. I'd read the mostly negative reviews before travelling and set off with a high degree of trepidation. However, the experience from end to end was excellent. Speedy check in at LGW and BIO. Very short delay (15 minutes) each end, but nothing to worry about. Very organised boarding at LGW - rear boards first, so bear that in mind when you are choosing seats, as there wasn't much overhead locker space for those who boarded last. Boarding at BIO was odd, as people formed a massive queue and stood in it for 45 minutes, only for the aircraft to be boarded by seat row number (rear first), so no queuing is necesssary. Aircraft both ways were modern A320s, very clean and smart inside. Not a lot of leg room, but, to be fair, what can you expect on a budget airline with a round trip price of £42. Service was polite and efficient. Cabin crew well presented. Most PAs were in Spanish, but, again it is a Spanish airline. (I've never heard EZY make PAs in Spanish either on their Spanish flights from the UK). So, all in all, a good experience. Am a frequent traveller to the north of Spain and they are starting a route from LGW to OVD in May - so will definitely be using it rather than driving from Brighton to Stansted.

### "like being ripped off"
I was charged twice for making a simple online booking from Luton to Amsterdam and back! I was told to make sure only 1 booking was used however a rude member of staff behind the counter used both bookings which left me waiting nearly 3 weeks for a simple refund-  which is rather annoying considering they can take the money out within 3 hours and it should never have happened in the first place. I never got the full refund either as they didn't refund the second booking fee. I have now returned home to a £60 phone bill for speaking to customer service about a fault on there behalf. Do not fly Vueling Airlines unless you like being ripped off.

### "staff friendly and efficient"
Flew Vueling from London Gatwick to Florence. After a 10 minute delay to take off due to air traffic congestion we arrived on time. Refreshments were served after 30 minutes. Seats were comfortable, staff friendly and efficient. The only negative was that the original departure time was put back two hours although we were given plenty of advance warning.

### "a pretty nice airline"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Athens to Barcelona and found it to be a pretty nice airline. Ticket price was very competitive. Both flights departed on time. They also agreed to take our hand bags checked for free. Clean cabin and polite crew. The only disadvantage was that the crew could have been stricter towards passengers who wanted to walk to the toilet when there was some turbulence.

### "satisfied except for seat pitch"
Granada to Barcelona was an excellent experience. Flight was late arriving but cabin crew was helpful in getting everyone settled for an on time departure. My expectations were low based on reviews but I was completely satisfied except for seat pitch which was minimal. However, flight was only one hour and great value for the fare. Luggage delivery in BCN took 40 minutes but that might be the airport rather than Vueling.

### "totally incompetent airline"
Malaga to Cardiff with Vueling. I don't know where to start! Worst flights of my life. On the flight out only black coffee was available as they had no milk! Not a huge problem I know, but that should have been a warning. At luggage check in we were told by the rudest woman i've ever met that we had only paid for one check in bag. Despite having our confirmation print out with us she insisted we 35 euro for our second bag. There was no reasoning with her so we just paid as the entire experience was so awful. Boarding the plane was a complete shambles with front boarders being called first, then with almost no communication that changed to back boarders. There were people wandering around not knowing what on earth was happening. Whatever you do steer clear of this totally incompetent so called airline.

### "first and last time with Vueling"
We travelled with Vueling from Amsterdam to Malaga return for the first and last time with Vueling. I could hardly sit because of the lack of space. The temperature in the cabin was on the way to Malaga terribly high and I felt that I was almost going to faint. On my request the captain lowered it. I was not the only one complaining. The airplane was too late for both flights: no information was given. All passengers had been waiting long before embarking. We were terribly thirsty. It took more than an hour before the cabin crew started to provide passengers with food/drinks, and even half-an-hour more before seat #8 was reached. There was hardly any food onboard. No wine or beer, a few bottles of water were left. On our way back I ate a ciabatta, not very tasteful. No food for vegetarians, so my wife took chips. On both flights it was impossible to understand the captain's English nor that of some of the cabin crew. The front toilet was locked all the time. On our way back we noticed that this toilet was probably the smallest of all planes.

### "definitely one to avoid"
Vueling Airlines from Rome to London Gatwick was a codeshare flight, booked via BA as a return flight on a business trip. Whilst you don't expect vast amounts of room in economy, it's always possible to balance a small laptop on your knees and get some work done. With Vueling there was no chance. There was so little room that you couldn't even extend your table. The man next to me was in so much discomfort with hours knees jammed against the seat in front that he was attempting to put the in flight magazine between his knees and the seat back as padding. Considering this was booked via BA, it feels like you've been cheated as the in flight service is significantly below many of the budget airlines. This is definitely one to avoid.

### "like going back to the 1970s"
A dreadful airline. The plane and the flight from Birmingham to Barcelona were fine but getting on it is another matter. At Birmingham, there was no online check-in facility, meaning everyone had to queue, even with no bags to check, and then the desk only opened less than two hours before the departure time. Coming back, there was online check in but we were unable to print out boarding passes. We expected to find a self-service machine at the airport. None available and once again, we had a long queue. Flying with Vueling is like going back to the 1970s. I will not do it again.

### "such a terrible experience"
Worst experience ever! We took a flight on 1st April from Amsterdam to Luton and the flight was delayed two hours without any announcement! The gates opened on schedule but we had to wait 2 hours past the initial departure time. On the 3rd April we returned back to Amsterdam and again there was a delay of 3 hours! The worst airline ever! No information was given about the delay, no serious apologies, people were left clueless on the airport just waiting for the flight to arrive. I feel worse for people who had to go to other cities and the only option to reach home was by taxi. The expenses that come along with that are even more than the ticket price. Such a terrible experience, and I will never fly with Vueling again.

### "the lack of professionalism"
My daughter is back packing through Europe. She was traveling from San Sebastian to Split with a connection in Madrid and Rome and her bag got lost. It's been 5 days now - Vueling makes it very hard to contact them. They do not return her or my emails either and apparently I cannot reach them from Canada except when I call the head office which telling me it is a problem with my phone company! Which is not, I checked. So my daughter is without the bag which holds everything she needs right now. She is living a terrible experience. Of course there will be the issue to get money back for her extra expenses, which should be interesting. As her far away mother, I am worry and extremely frustrated with the lack of professionalism this company shows. My advise, stay away from Vueling....

### "a very disappointing experience"
Our Vueling flight from Amsterdam to Luton was delayed by 2 hours which can happen, but an airline should keep it's customers informed. From the moment that we arrived at the airport check in desk to the moment we landed we were given very little information and no apology. Bizarrely we still had to check in despite the fact that they have an app that appears to have this facility. The check in procedure took significantly longer than one would expect. Whilst two of the ground staff were friendly, a third was openly rude and hostile toward frustrated customers. We arrived back in the UK at a much later time than we had anticipated after being on a flight where the cabin crew disappeared for it's entire duration, with little or no information available. Refreshments were also unavailable which is understandable given the shortness of the flight. Vueling was a very disappointing experience and one that I hope not to repeat.

### "first and last time I will fly them"
Myself and a friend were returning from a wonderful 3 day break in Barcelona to Manchester, we went through passport control and were then left 20 minutes standing on a very cold staircase waiting for a transfer bus to the airplane, after boarding the bus we were immediatlty told that due to there not being enough "Crew" there would be a delay we were then put in a holding room with no exit, no drink or food facilities and no members of staff to inform us what was happening,. After an hour of passengers wandering around and being challenged by surly security staff we were then allowed out of the room and taken back to the original departure gate. Where staff accused us of delaying the plane and demanded to know where we had been (even though we had been in the room where they had put us) essentially through lack of communication between their staff they had lost us! We then had to repeat the process of going through the passport control and gate, eventually we were on the plane and took off 2.5 hours later. The delay if well managed would have been an inconvenience but these things happen, all they had to do was treat us with common courtesy if they had informed us fully what was happening and left us in the departure lounge with food, drink and updated information not many complained. The pilot apologised for the delay but said that there was a crew available and that there had been a technical problem. More confusion? Since returning home I have read other reviews about this airline and my experience appears to be common occurrence, the first and last time I will fly with them.

### "flight is announced cancelled"
Booked on flight from Paris CGD to Madrid with kid on 31 March departing 18.50. Upon arrival at CDG airport flight is announced cancelled (only flight cancelled on departure panel in T3). At the same time sms received on mobile indicated flight cancelled due to France strikes (in the national press, indication that CDG not affected by strike). Approx 200 person in front of customer service desk of 1 person. Waiting during 4 hours (from 15.30 till 19.30) still +100 persons in front and many behind us). Call center, web page of Vueling not working. Message on call center indicating to call back. After 4 hours and numerous calls succeed through spanish language option to speak to call agent. They refuse any compensation, hotel arrangements or book us on sister companies like Iberia, Iberia express or BA. Customer service agent indicate they cannot book us either through Barcelona as all Vueling flights between Barcelona and Madrid are cancelled. They also indicate that computers have been down for several hours. They agree to rebook us the next day on direct flight Vueling at 14.55 arriving 16.55 (same flight code VY8205) and they send us by mail new boarding cards. On 1 April, upon arrival and checking for new flight, they indicate that boarding passes are not valid (apparantly the previous day's flight is still open in their system. New boarding passes received, but on waiting list. After new visit to customer support counter, new boarding passes. Flight due to leave at 14.55 is delayed. Plane is still in Madrid, finally arrives 16.30, passengers set on bus towards airplane approximately 17.00. Approx 18.00 all passengers sitting in plane, pilot announced that no co-pilot (he has done maximum hours). At 18.39 with new second pilot on board plane takes off. Finally arrived at Madrid airport at 20.31 (official airport arrival time, curiously on Vueling web 20.22. We did get some free water on board and some voucher for sandwich while waiting in the airport. But compensation for 24 hours delay, extra accommodation, according EU regulation nothing. Recommendation: even amongst low costs airlines there are some good ones and bad ones, you can fly low cost but select those that assist their customers.

### "inexplicable lack of competence"
Just landed Barcelona on a Vueling flight from Tenerife - horrible, inexplicable lack of competence and service. On arriving at North terminal at 5:45am for 7am departure, we encountered very long check in lines; 50 minutes later, the counter agent gave us our boarding passes, then said we had to take our checked luggage and board a bus to go to the South terminal, explaining that their plane was at the wrong terminal. After another hour, we unloaded  and loaded) our luggage from the bus; more long lines for 2nd check in of 150-180 passengers. Finally, in the air (2 hrs late) they proceeded to sincerely apologize but still charged for snacks and drinks (even bottled water). Finally arrived to a luggage fiasco with delays, waiting and repeated luggage carousel changes for another hour. Not once did they have adequate staff out front to explain and advise as to what was going on or to offer solutions.

### "overbooked this flight"
Vueling overbooked this flight from London to Barcelona. I was travelling from Australia to Spain and this was the last of 4 flights over 48 hours with a small child. Vueling bumped me even though I paid my ticked four months ago and arrived at the airport 2 hours before the flight. Vueling also lost my luggage and did not provide me with my statuatory right of care whilst we suffered a five hour delay. We have still not received our luggage 24 hours later. They should be closed down.

### "the worst flight experience"
The Valencia to Paris Orly flight was delayed to more then 8 hours (from 20h35 to 04h25). In the airport there was nobody to give us any information about what was going on. They were just texting us messages (10 in total), saying that "sorry, your flight is delayed, we're working on it". By midnight, they made us mount to the aircraft, but after half an hour they told us that their team is tired, need rest and thus, we should descend from airplane back to the airport and wait another 4 hours till the next flight. We (about 200 passengers, many with little children) we forced to wait without food and water in the empty cold airport. Vueling didn't offer anything, even breakfast or coffee when we were finally ready to fly at 4h25. No flight compensation were offered. It was the worst flight experience in my life.

### "disorganization makes me nervous"
I have flown with Vueling many a time, as I currently live in Spain, and I have not had much trouble with them in the past. My only complaints were that sometimes they would send me an email reminding me to check-in online and sometimes they wouldn't. Sometimes the online check-in would allow me to choose seats and sometimes it wouldn't. However, my most recent journey from Paris Orly to Barcelona has made me never want to fly Vueling again. First, the flight was delayed 2 hours and 40 minutes. Then we boarded the plane, one hour behind schedule, and were told we had to disembark, without ever explaining what the delays were from. We were told our flight (originally 8pm) would leave in the morning. They just said the morning. What time? Who knows. They had some hotel rooms available at Charles De Gaulle airport and were going to bus people there, but they did not have enough rooms for everyone nor did they offer vouchers. Luckily I had a friend in Paris I could stay with but I had to pay for transportation to get there. I checked that night and the next morning to see when the flight was rescheduled to leave but there was no information. It just said to go to the airport and that the flight would leave the next day. Someone I overheard the night before said she thought the flight was rescheduled to 9am, so that was all the information I had. I arrived at the airport and found out the flight was to leave at 11AM. The only compensation I received was one sandwich at the first delay and one croissant the next morning. I'm sorry, but that is absolutely ridiculous. I don't understand how a company can be so disorganized as to not alert their passengers of the status of their flight, not the reason for the delay, nor make accommodations or compensations for the inconvenience. You may save $50 on the flight, but you could end up paying for a cab, a hotel, and one less day or work/school, etc. I understand this is not the normal experience, but the utter disorganization makes me nervous to ever travel with them again. I am considering canceling flights I already booked with Vueling.

### "worst airline experience"
Ibiza to Paris via Barcelona with Vueling. The Ibiza flight to Barcelona flight was delayed, causing us to miss the connection. No effort was made to rebook us on the next available flight, or ensure the baggage followed ok. No information other than the initial delay announcement was provided. During a three hour period, none of the customer call centers were reachable, putting our calls on hold for an eternity prior to inviting us to call back later. Vueling charge 9cts a minute for the privilege. Worst airline experience ever.

### "flight been delayed for 5 hours"
London Gatwick to Barcelona with Vueling. Checked in 3 hours early and it was only 2.5 hours later (after passing immigration) that we found out that the flight had been delayed for 5 hours. No form of contact from the airline - we found out only from the flight schedule displays when we tried to find our boarding gate. It appears they have moved us to their next available flight, offering us no explanation whatsoever and leaving us inside immigration with 5 hours to kill. Definitely won't count on flying with Vueling again.

### "use again for short haul"
Barcelona to and then Bilbao to Seville two days later with Vueling. Smart looking cabin, almost full on both flights. Crew allowed me to move to a less crowded row when boarding was completed. Vueling requires payment in order to choose seat (as most European low cost carriers), which I have not done. Did online check-in, however according to their website check in at the airport is free. Tight leg space (185cm height), but flights were short. Departures and arrivals on time. Was considering to buy a drink on board, however trolley passed late, so I did not. Very good value for money (80 EUR for two flights, booked 6 months in advance). Would use again for short haul.

### "the 4 hours I waited"
Vueling flight cancelled from BCN to ORY due to air traffic controllers strike. At 01:40 I was sent an SMS directing me to a website for information regarding my 09:20 cancelled flight. The website suggested I go to the airport to “please contact Vueling staff at the airport if you wish to change your flight or request a refund”. I went to the airport at 06:00 and was told to wait in a line that snaked through the end of the airport. During the 4 hours I waited not a single representative of the airline came down the line of hundreds of children, parents and the elderly to let Vueling’s customers know exactly what the status of today’s or tomorrow’s flights was, as in “All our flights to Paris are full for today and tomorrow”, which would have allowed Vuelings customers to make alternative plans. When I arrived at a customer service window I was told there would be no refunds at the window and I must go on-line. It’s easy”, I was told as he attempted to show me through the glass that separated us, me trying to see the computer screen over the shoulder of a woman standing between us. I assured him it wasn’t all that easy as I had tried to do it before the early morning ride to the airport. I have since spent 45 minutes on Vueling's website searching for the way to do this as “manage my bookings” provides no clue. This is above and beyond the 22 attempted calls made to the Vueling English language customer service department (both from the increasingly tense airport queue and home). All the calls timed out and disconnected after three to four minutes on hold or simply directed me to “call back in a few minutes” before the musical wait. I was told by the customer service gentleman at the airport that I have seven days to request the refund. My bet is it won’t happen.

### "would fly Vueling again"
Luton to Amsterdam with Vueling. I was pleasantly surprised. Of course it's a budget service, but as the flight to Amsterdam is only an hour long I didn't need any frills. Some people have commented on the lack of legroom in Vueling planes. I assume they were on a different aircraft type, as I am 6 foot 2 and was able to stretch my legs under the seat in front and found the flights very comfortable. The one gripe is that my return flight was delayed by 2.5 hours and there was no explanation why. Apart from this, I would fly Vueling again.

### "seats appeared cheap"
Flew Vueling Airlines from Prague to Gran Canaria via Barcelona. Good modern aircraft, friendly staff, greeted and welcomed on board - slightly dirty when I arrived at my seat. I had a long flight ahead of me with a connection so was looking forward to sitting back in my seat - this was not possible - none of the seats on-board reclined. I was even offered emergency exit rows but I said no because I know these seats do not recline for safety reasons. The seats appeared cheap - I was slightly surprised and disappointed - I sat at the back of the plane and no button to recline - not comfortable sitting upright for long periods. Would recommend however not for long flights or with connections.

### "no control of onboard luggage"
Flew Edinburgh to Palma via Dublin. Vueling Airlines has not even got the basics right. Not possible to check in online, no through boarding passes issued at either Edinburgh or Dublin for transferring passengers in Barcelona which caused major mayhem at Barcelona resulting in connecting passengers missing onward flight. On top of that there is no control of onboard luggage which delayed the Dublin departure, with passengers carrying 2 or 3 bags onboard. My advice is never book a connecting flight with this airline. Also, the seat pitch at 28 inches is terrible. Point to point travel would obviously be better, I would be very reluctant to choose this airline again.

### "ground-staff was incompetent"
No amount of words can describe how terrible this company is. Check-in is a free for all disaster as they do not sufficient check-in desks available. Their ground-staff was incompetent. Do not expect them to even try and resolve and problem you may have. There is no way of complaining to Vueling. Their website does not even list South Africa, which makes it impossible to send them an email, but our money is good enough when booking a flight.

### "Vueling no way, never again"
We booked a Vueling Airlines flight via a French portal (govoyage). Flight would have been on a Saturday from Bruxelles to Bilbao in the early afternoon, arriving in Bilbao at about 5pm. One Day after accepting my booking and confirming the flight details by email and after charging the price to my credit card, Vueling sent an eMail announcing that the flight was canceled. Their counter proposal was a flight on Saturday night from Bruxelles to Barcelona, arriving at Barcelona at about 11pm and continuing to Bilbao next morning at 9am. So losing one night at the airport. I accepted the possibility to cancel the flight, but to get the money back was (and is) a nightmare. People at the hotline were more than unfriendly. Vueling no way, never again.

### "first and last time"
London to Rome with Vueling - the first and last time I will fly with this airline. The queue to board took ages, the flight was severely delayed and they made many of us check in our hand luggage just as we were boarding saying that the plane was full. When we got on there was plenty of space in the luggage compartments. I fly a lot and this was one of the worst experiences I've had. I am going to change my return flight as I'm not prepared to suffer this again.

### "flight was mostly uneventful"
Messy boarding: There was no space to queue at the gate and there were no lanes or barriers or anything else putting some order in the queueing crowd. Another airplane was disembarking at the same counter while we were boarding - the bus to the aircraft had not yet arrived and people were piling up at the end of the staircase. Then after getting on the plane, passengers blocked the aisle and the crew stood by idle - in total we took slightly over 30 minutes to fully board an A320. The very expensive (close to 500€) one way ticket I had did not afford any amenities - seat spacing was far below average even for an LCC. I'm fairly tall and used to my knees touching the seat in front. On this flight, they were jammed into it. Food and drink selection was fairly poor and expensive - the Club sandwich was the only choice that looked halfway edible (albeit drowned in mayonnaise). I paid 6,50€ for that. Also it took roughly 45 minutes from the start of food service until they reached me in row 15. The flight itself fortunately was mostly uneventful and arrived only 10 minutes late. A fairly rude flight attendant folded down the middle seat armrest for descent while I was just putting my shoes back on, slamming it right into my back. No apology was offered and she also didn't seem to care about my seat neighbor's seatbelt not being closed and several window shades being down. Armrests were a top priority though. No wifi, connectivity or entertainment was offered on this flight of almost 4 hours.

### "not good for value at all"
The Vueling Airlines flight from Florence to London Gatwick was 30min early, which was the only good thing about this airline. Around €60 for the one way ticket is not cheap for a low budget airline. Ground staff at check in were rude, despite the fact that they arrived at checkin desk late. (One staff arrived 10min late, and the other was 25min late). Almost all the passengers who needed to do bag drops arrived there 2hrs before the flight departure, waiting for the checkin staff to arrive. At the Swiss and Lufthansa counters next to Vueling, each of the airlines had 3-4 staffs. No online checkin available for non-EU/EEA passport holders, so that's why I had to deal with the ground staff. Seats were very tight, the smallest I've seen. It's not good for value at all. I should have just taken the train to Pisa and took easyjet back to London. I will never ever take vueling again.https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=383226&action=edit#edit_timestamp

### "delayed by over 3 hours"
Vueling Airlines from Gatwick to Rome, Cramped seats, no room to sit comfortably (I am 6ft but the person next to me is 5ft 5 and they couldn't fit their legs in comfortably). Flight delayed by over 3 hours, meaning final landing time in Rome was after 3am. No customer service, inaccurate information given throughout about timing. Flight was over £200.00 return, so not cheap.

### "on time and comfortable"
Gatwick to Bilbao and I enjoyed the flight. Staff excellent. Flight was on time and comfortable. Was kept imformed at all times. First time flying with Vueling Airlines. Had a problem with name on ticket, rang them and changed it without any problem.

### "Never again with Vueling"
Traveling with 2 persons and 2 cats from Saint Petersburg to Santiago de Compostela in Spain for 590 Euro. The Vueling aircraft to depart at 6 am broke down at arrival in our departure aiport Saint petersburg in Russia. Staff had us leav main terminal area to hide us in back room terminal area at unused gate first. Then half an hour later we had to go all the way back an leave gate area altogether to check in counters, where we were told that plane would only depart at 4 pm, so 1 hours later, as a replacement crew and plane was being sent all the way from Spain. No food and beverage coupons were issued thn. People like us who stayd at private addresses in LED were told to travel back at pur own expense to those homes (1.5 hour away) and wait for a call to come back to airport later. Taxi costs would be reimbursed. Vueling offered fake alternative to cancel flight, but would only refund money two weeks later, which was useless at that moment of course. Despite requests to tell what woudl happen with connecting flights no staff member wanted to commit to anything but told us they would take care of them. Upon picking up luggage (complex operation) which was already in other area checked in and driving back far way to house, we got a call shortly after to return that flight would leave 3 hours earlier. Upon arrival at LED airport restaurant vouchers were issued but useless as flight would leave in less than an hour and restaurants were all booked. So we had no food since coupons can only be spent in restaurants. Plane still left half an hour late so in total 7.5 hour late and they were selling drinks and food on the plane instead of providing passengers with them for free for the inconvenience. No sense of redemption. Upon arrival in Barcelona the information given for where the counter for transits would be was wrong. Eventually we found the counter ad they confirmed the problem of getting cnecting flights and referred us to another counter with a waiting line. At that counter they told us there was no more connecting flight to SCQ (Santiago) , which any dim wit would know, so no news. They could only offer us a flight to an airport 1 1/2 hour away from Santiago (plus same distance from our home) plus bus transportation to Santiago or stay overnight in Barcelona (imagine, with 2 cats) in hotel and fly the next day direct. A restaurant coupon was given again, again useless as the flight would leave very soon. So we still had no food. We took the flight to the other city and on arrival there was no one to welcome us for the transfer to a cab or bus to Santiago, plus it was already very late. So we had to rent at our own expense an expensive car and had to cancel with costs our own prepaid 5 day rental in Santiago and drive our rental home instead of to Santiago. It all cost us 100s of Euros extra and of course the stress of an extra travel time of 11 hours, plus the extra time spent on returning a car rental the next days in a different far away town. Upon contacting Vueling about paying our costs, they refused to pay taxi costs and took zero responsibility saying they were not obliged to pay us anything (despite the laws saying opposite). We escalated it to a few passenger claim services. It seems we may succeed with one out of 3 of those to get what is due, but it will take a while. Never again with Vueling.

### "poor customer service skills"
Gatwick to Ibiza via Barcelona with Vueling. After arriving in Ibiza both my hold bags did not appear. I reported this to the agent and received the necessary information to contact the airline. On contacting the airline I was told I could buy emergency items and would be reimbursed provided I supplied the receipts. 48 hours later 1 of my bags was delivered to my hotel. At the end of my stay the other bag was still missing. On my return to the UK I sent receipts for items I purchased because of the delayed baggage for which they reimbursed me. After several emails I sent to Vueling regarding the lost baggage I was informed that they had paid for the loss. I tried to explain to them that the payment they made was for the delayed baggage emergency items purchased not the lost baggage. They did not accept that the bag was lost until well after they paid for delayed baggage so they could not have paid for the loss. I requested a telephone number so I could contact them to try to sort the matter out but received no answer. I have now had to use my travel insurer to sort the problem. I cannot believe the attitude of the airline towards me and would definitely not recommend them to anyone. They have very poor customer service skills.

### "trip went very well"
Malaga to Copenhagen. This route is used heavily for people going on vacation, so being booked on it for business made me a bit worried, especially as it was my first time with Vueling. For very little cost I managed to select my seat in the front of the aircraft, and I was double lucky as I got the whole row for myself! Seats were fine, food (for pay) was a decent selection, and the whole trip went very well. Will select again!

### "haughty cabin crew member"
A couple of years back, Vueling were streets ahead of Ryanair in just about every aspect of customer satisfaction. As Ryanair have improved in that regard, so too have Vueling gone down, so much so that, these days, there's not much to choose between them. Boarding for both flights from Barcelona to La Palma was rather chaotic, and, ex BCN involved a bus ride to the plane. Despite the fact that there were loads of empty seats in the first 7 rows, when I asked, politely in Spanish, after take off, if we could spread out and get a bit more space, I was rudely told by a haughty cabin crew member that if I wanted to sit there I should have paid more. When I asked what the cost of an upgrade was, he just shrugged. On all the Vueling flights I take, it seems to take ages before the crew can be bothered to go round with the drink/food service. This flight was in one of the new planes with the lightweight (aka uncomfortable) seats. Perhaps these are OK for a short 90 min hop, but not for a 3.5 hour trip to the Canaries. Return from La Palma was a little better, on an older plane with proper seats. Also it was a little less crowded, so space was not an issue. Plus points were that both flights arrived on time. Overall, however, it's a shame to see standards drop month on month on Vueling flights.

### "nice ground and inflight staff"
Nice flight with Vueling from Palma de Mallorca to Bilbao. On time, nice ground and inflight staff, toilet very clean and punctual. The plane was not full so everything was perfect. Only drawback, they didn't even offer water for free like many airlines and low cost airlines in South America.

### "had many problems"
Used Vueling many times during 2014 and 2015 (Punto member as well as Gold membership in OneWorld). The service at the beginning was really great, however, during our recent flights and also on our last flight Barcelona to Venice we had many problems. During recent flights the front toilets of the plane were closed and the staff didn't clean the back toilets, which was of course a problem. All our communication with Vueling ended without a decent response from the airline. During our flight to Venice, we booked as usual Priority boarding tickets, but none of the staff let us go on the plane first. Moreover, the front toilets was closed again. Similar to last time, no response from the airline, no matter the communication type. Unfortunately, from a very good low-cost company they have become one of the worst.

### "staff rude and unfriendly"
Barcelona to Granada with Vueling. Extremely poor Check in, the process was very messy and disorganized. Took almost 45 min to check in. Boarding gate was supposed to open at 10.10am and flight was supposed to depart at 10.45am but at 10.50am staff announced the plane wasn't ready and would update in 30mins however at 11.35am there was still no news. When asked the staff were extremely rude and unfriendly. They insisted they knew nothing. Why work here then?

### "rude inflight staff"
Poor, poor, poor. First of all we had a rude check in for our flight from Gatwick to Barcelona, we then had a 3 hour delay with no explanation and then had rude inflight staff. Room onboard is just ridiculous. If you are tall, or on the larger side, forget it. No welcome onto the aircraft or apology for 3 hour delay. Staff were too busy talking amongst each other. Staff rude throughout whole flight. No smiles. I will never fly with Vueling Airlines again. Flights were cheapish but I would rather have paid double and flown comfortably ensuring a good start to our holiday.

### "definitely fly them again"
Barcelona to Granada with Vueling. Our on-line check in was easy, baggage check in at Barcelona airport was a piece of cake and customer service staff were friendly, courteous and efficient. Boarding was a breeze, flight was smooth, with the cabin crew courteous and service oriented. There was no hassle with our experience flying Vueling and would definitely fly them again.

### "miserable unfriendly crew"
London Gatwick to Rome with Vueling. The most miserable unfriendly crew. Not helpful, abrupt and to be honest rude. I went to use the toilet just before take-off, the doors were still open and was told I can't use it. I would rather never fly again with this code share of BA. Their crew need manners - my wife had an accident in October breaking her arm in 3 places and I asked if she could board first - the lady just said she can walk.

### "avoid them in future"
Paris CDG to Madrid with Vueling. Their app lets you check in but won´t issue any boarding pass. You still have to print the actual sheet with the scanning code. If you decide to check in in a time frame that Vueling considers too late (2 days before!) then you will only be able to do it at the airport as the app will not assign you any random seat but you will be forced to pay for seat assignment. How mean and stupid is that? Their seat space is the worst, even in their so-called emergency exits (15 Euros for the privilege of sitting on one of them!). Attendants are stressed, refreshments expensive (10 Euros for a sandwich and a coke) and they normally have run out of half of what is listed in the menu. They´re not that cheap either. Will go out of my way to avoid them in future.

### "contempt for customers"
Barcelona to Lyon, and they seated my partner and I on opposite ends of the plane and then expected us to pay a fee to be sat together!! Then when we board the plane we see that there are plenty of space seats together. I understand it's a low cost airline but that's a pretty cynical way to make money and leaves you feeling swindled. Shows Vueling have a total contempt for their customers.

### "never fly with them again"
Barcelona to Stockholm with Vueling, and because I have a lack of time I don't want to check in any luggage. I am just bringing hand luggage to save time. They take my hand luggage when entering the plane and check it in anyway, because they have lack of space for all the hand luggage. Apparently you have to be fast to check in at the plane if you want to be sure to bring your hand luggage. They are rude and unfriendly. I will never fly with them again.

### "never travel Vueling again"
I will never travel with Vueling Airlines again. Their flight from Dubrovnik to Barcelona was delayed more than 6 hours, and I missed my next flight from Barcelona. I had to re-buy ticket. They didn't even want to listen me, the staff is very uncomfortable and it is impossible to contact their Customer Service. They didn't want provide a new ticket (although they have flight to my destination) as well as the night in Barcelona. New ticket and night in hotel in Barcelona, I spent a lot of money. Would not recommend this company to anyone.

### "not worth the risk or stress"
Amsterdam to Rome and Check in was in the corner of the airport. Made us walk 2 whole terminals to pass through security. After running to the boarding gate because "boarding gate was closing" was forced to wait a further 15 minutes before boarding began. Boarding was unbearably slow. Seats were cramped. They tried to milk money out in every possible way. Flight attendants unhelpful and unfriendly. After getting out of the airplane, found out luggage was lost. Literal hateful staff at counter who couldn't wait to get rid of everybody to chat with her friends. Ground staff were disorderly. Went back to the airport 3 days later as recommended by a few sources. Spent one and a half hours being pushed around for no result. Definitely not worth the risk or stress.

### "very enjoyable flight"
Alicante to Barcelona with Vueling Airlines, and I was very dubious about traveling with them. There wasn't loads of leg room, I'm 1'70 so not as tall as most men, but I had plenty of space - much more than Ryanair. The seats were comfortable, on my return journey I had automatically been given a middle seat and the check in guy asked if I'd like to swap and what would I prefer window or aisle. The crew onboard were friendly and happy, very enjoyable flight surprisingly.

### "impossible to contact them"
Barcelona to Alicante. This was the second time I have flown this route with Vueling. My father was badly injured and I arrived a day earlier than my scheduled flight. They would not change my ticket, put me on an earlier flight or offer me a refund. The people at the service desk were unhelpful and couldn't give a damn. I caught the train as I would get there sooner. On the return flight I was offered the same indifference. I have since tried to contact them as I need documentation for my insurance and it is impossible to make contact with them.

### "very nice experience"
I had a very nice experience on Vueling Airlines Christmas Eve flight from Barcelona to Fiumicino. Naturally, the passengers were very eager to get to their seats and most had larger than the usual carry-on bags. The cabin crew managed to remain very calm and pleasant, providing great service.

### "definitely use carry on"
Just an update on a Vueling Airlines review I wrote a while ago concerning delayed baggage. I sent all the required documents registered mail to the address that I was given. Apparently they were no longer at that address but the Post Office did track them down. After 2 months of waiting I received an email saying that my compensation was being awarded, though no amount was ever given. I am now receiving emails saying that they are sorry I disagree with the amount of money. Since no monies have ever been received and any correspondence results in the same generic email being sent back, I am very doubtful we will see anything. My advice is definitely to use carry on with this airline, we have learned the hard way.

### "don't care about passengers"
As a company Vueling Airlines obviously don't care about passengers. Tiny seats, poor legroom, no refreshments of any kind during a 4 hour long flight. We have seen the flight attendant while boarding and disembarking the plane, they were nowhere to be seen during the whole flight. There wasn't any entertainment nor screens with our flight route. in addition, the plane seemed to be very old.

### "I will use again"
My first time flying Vueling Airlines and both flights (Seville to Palma return) were fine. Both flights were on time, actually arrived ahead of schedule on return flight. Older A320 feels cramped and worn, but the newer (winglets) A320, with Recaro seats, give more knee room. The all-female cabin crew were friendly and efficient, both ways. Check-in was also no-hassle. Offered "window or aisle" seat, without asking and tickets were issued at the desk, free of charge. I would rate Vueling about the same as Easyjet - a similar level of service and value for money. I will use again.

### "A sweet and sour experience"
I flew Vueling Airlines from Munich (MUC) to Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI) in seat 10A. The plane was a bit dirty (especially the hand luggage compartments) and took off half an hour later than scheduled time. The worst thing was a pair of two annoying children that were seated behind me, who didn't stop shouting very loudly, playing their iPads full-volume, and hitting other seats, mainly mine with their mother not saying anything. For the other hand, the flight was nice and smooth until landing, that was a bit rough. Though it was dinner time, no food or beverages was given (as usual in this airline), and the on-board selection was overpriced. There was little leg room too. However, the flight had some good things: There were three diferent magazines for reading (Arline's one, Yorokobu and Forbes), the pilot spoke a perfect native-like English (though being Spanish) and lugagge arrived on time to the belts on Palma. A sweet and sour experience, I will give them other opportunity.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
I had three flights booked with Vueling Airlines on a recent trip to Europe, and I was pleasantly surprised that all three went off on time, and without a hitch. One plane seemed to have a tighter seat pitch than the other two; so much that I thought the seat in front might break my nose when the man in it leaned back! There was a mighty scrum at Munich security, but that was an airport glitch and no fault of the airline. I was very pleased with Vueling.

### "seats were cramped"
Vueling Airlines from Edinburgh to Barcelona. Flight out was good, but delayed by 30 mins and nobody told us and no apology for the delay. Cabin crew were nice, waited about 35 mins before the refreshments came round. no duty free. I'm not very tall but seats were cramped and no leg room and uncomfortable seats. Flight back to Edinburgh late in leaving again without explanation, 45 mins before refreshments came. One member of the cabin crew was so rude when we had a problem with our seats, she couldn't care less. Also there was rubbish around seat left from last passengers.

### "recheck your luggage"
I used Vueling for the first time during a trip from Paris to Seville as the fare looked reasonable and flight timings seemed to work well. My luggage was checked through from Johannesburg to Seville but did not make it onto the connecting flight in Paris and resulted in an inconvenient 2 day wait for the luggage in addition to no drop off service for the luggage (I needed to go to the airport to collect). In addition, the claim process was slow and resulted in a non-payment due to Vueling not being able to verify that the luggage was checked in (even though all luggage tags were submitted to the agents in Seville). The flights themselves were fine with the seating being comfortable and the plane in good condition. The Vueling apple app is useless as it keeps crashing and the website is not the most mobile friendly. If you do fly Vueling, recheck your luggage to avoid a similar incident.

### "gratitude towards this airline"
While waiting to board the plane, my husband passed out and later responded. The Vueling Airlines staff called emergency and after some tests decided he needed to go to the hospital. The staff was wonderful and said that when we could fly again there would be no extra charge. We returned the next day for the same flight and we were accommodated in the most respectful way, including picking up our large luggage in storage. They went out of their way to make us comfortable, so I have nothing but gratitude towards this airline.

### "staff service good"
Vueling Airlines from Malaga to Barcelona return. Outbound was a full flight with an off duty crew in uniform seated in the front of the aircraft. Cabin staff service good. My only complaint was during disembarkation, the crew were chatting with their off duty counterparts and ignoring the passengers leave. Return leg was a third full, very pleasant crew and onboard announcements etc. On-line check-in fine. Bar service fine.

### "fly with them again"
Never having flown with Vueling Airlines before I was a bit unsure as to what to expect. The aircraft was clean, comfortable, on time and the staff actually talked to the passengers, provided a good service and I was shown to my seat on both flights. Only downside was that dump of an airport at Cardiff - hopefully one day they will fly from Bristol. I will fly with them again.

### "would happily recommend"
We were a bit hesitant to book our Vueling Airlines flight after reading many negative reviews. The staff we encountered were helpful and friendly, aircraft was comfy and we certainly had enough leg room (something I am pleased about due to being pregnant ). We arrived at the scheduled arrival time so that was an added bonus. We really enjoyed our flight and would happily recommend to others.

### "friendly and helpful staff"
We flew from Barcelona to Rome and Florence to Gatwick during our 3 week European vacation. Our concerns about Vueling were completely unnecessary. Checkin was a breeze, friendly and helpful staff and flight crew, and no lost luggage. We were given our gate information in a timely manner. The flight left on time and arrived early. We would have no reservations with flying with Vueling in the future.

### "efficient and friendly"
I have flown twice with Vueling in October. London Gatwick to Bilbao and Bilbao to Barcelona. The check in at Gatwick was surprisingly quick, at the somewhat quiet North terminal . The flight departed on time. For a budget airline it was efficient and friendly. The local flight to Barcelona was hassle free and on time. The tickets were very good value and there was no enforced online check in unlike that other budget behemoth.

### "seats look tired"
Prague to Barcelona. The Vueling Airlines A320 was an older model and the interior of the aircraft showed this - the seats look tired and there were a pieces of plastic missing here and there! Flight attendants friendly and professional helping to stow luggage or finding space for bags. Captain gave information before and during the flight and explained why we would experience turbulence overflying the Alps. This is very important for me who does not like flying through turbulence. Vueling is a low cost carrier and you do not get served anything free, and their tickets are not any cheaper than other airlines. My flight was on time for and service with a smile.

### "check in was horrific"
Rome to Vienna with Vueling Airlines. Onboard the staff was friendly, if seen - but during most of the flight, they were hiding in the back of the plane chatting. As for seats, there was virtually no legroom and I'm tall, but with around 190cm no supergiant. Check in was horrific. First of all, online check-in was impossible. At the counter we discovered that they had pre-booked us in a way, that our two children would sit apart from us with the clerk telling us that that couldn't be changed. It took a very loud argument to finally convince them that this is an issue relevant for the safety of minors during the flight, so that finally they at least managed to change our seat, so that 1 parent could sit with 1 child. Unfortunately, one can't give 0 stars in a review, as this is what Vueling Airlines would deserve.

### "pay for services not provided"
Being a no frills and budget airline and knowing how boarding can be chaotic from have flown many of this type of airline in the past, I made the decision to pay for Vueling Airlines priority boarding in advance to avoid the queues and for quick and easy ingress and egress for my sisters and myself. I did so as they only provide limited priority boarding unlike some airlines which allows everyone to book priority boarding resulting in no benefit. However, no priority boarding was given and the staff were not even aware that priority boarding had been booked by passengers. A formal complaint submitted to the airline who feels an apology was sufficient enough and refuses to commit to any refund of money for services not provided by them although paid for. The overall service throughout our travel experience was below par with the exception of the check-in clerk which I now have to question as maybe she was the one who was responsible for ensuring staff at the end should have been aware of priority boarding and failed to do her job. There is nothing that this airline offers that other no frills and budget airlines offer, not even online check-in. I will return to using the competitors who I know you are at least guaranteed a little bit of respect. Avoid Vueling Airlines if you don't wish to find yourself paying for services you won't be provided with.

### "unfriendly and ignored us"
Gatwick to Bilbao via Barcelona. Due to weather condition my flight was delayed - that is not problem when someone informs you, but the lady in the boarding gate was terrible, unfriendly and ignored all of us. Once onboard, the near 3 hours we were there without take off, they were very professional and friendly and the commander kept us informed all the time. Of course I missed my connection flight, once in Barcelona I tried to sort out the problem, once again no staff at any customer care desk. Finally Iberia sorted out my problem, but at the moment still not having my luggage.

### "did not allow check-in online"
Purchased two non refundable one way tickets online from Vueling Airlines two weeks before a flight from Barcelona to London. Nothing untoward about the process and no special conditions on the fare, other that a statement that this type of ticket did not allow checkin online. Arrived at the airport 50 minutes prior to departure to be told that it was a standby ticket? there were no seats on the flight, and that I would have to the gate to see whether there might be two seats available from no shows. On enquiry at the gate I was told that there were two steps to getting a seat on Vueling, one was checking online the other was getting a seat allocated, and despite being at the airport 50 minutes prior to departure they told me that every other passenger had checked in? So how did I have a ticket on that flight (which did not allow me to checkin online), and there was no seat? None of this makes any sense. Turns out there were 7 people in this circumstance, two of us and a family of five. It is a reasonable conclusion that the flight was oversold. We got on because there were only 3 seats left (apparently it was not full after all!) and the family did not want to separate. I will not fly Vueling Airlines again - this is what the US airlines did 15 years ago but at least they said they oversold and did not pretend otherwise.

### "utterly atrocious service"
Rome to Gatwick with Vueling Airlines, and utterly atrocious service. Completely misled at check-in desk where we were misinformed about fog-related delay to take-off. Zero interest afterwards from Vueling helpline - their advice was to leave the airport, even though I had explained that we'd checked in luggage, and buy another ticket for the following day!

### "service was pretty hopeless!
My Vueling flight was delayed arriving in Rome by one hour. At 00:25am, Fiumicino airport was effectively closed, and we Vueling passengers were forgotten and stuck in the bridge connecting the plane with the terminal gate that was locked - surreal and it was  45 minutes before a few airport staff came to unlock the gate! At 1:30 am, it was a nightmare to find any transport from FCO into Rome, which in the end I had to pay 70 euros for a taxi. It is time Vueling starts remembering its passengers, let alone improving its service! Vueling cancelled my return leg. I tried to get a refund for this flight, but Vueling will refund only 10% of my outstanding paid ticket! VY has only one direct flight per day on the route, and refused to book me on another airline (cheap), so I am forced to take its flight the next day and have to pay hefty expenses to stay in Rome for one extra night and day. Vueling Customer Service was pretty hopeless in all this, so beware.

### "the seating is cramped"
Outbound flight and inbound flights were about half an hour late. Surprising as the inbound was the 0700 from Barcelona which lands in Gatwick and returns. The seating is cramped. I am 5ft 11 inches tall. My knees were touching the seat in front even after having to seat with legs wide open. The Barcelona to Gatwick price was double the price of the Gatwick flight to Barcelona. Ok for 2 hour flight but would not use for longer flights.

### "seats are unbearably tight"
I heard so many horrible stories about Vueling that my expectations were already low. We arrived at the airport close to 2 hours early. We had already checked in and had our tickets. Just to hand over our luggage, we had to wait for 50 minutes, not counting security etc afterwards. This was just for the Vueling counters which were horribly organized and I just can't imagine how this airline can survive being such a mess. It makes you wonder how badly they handle everything else, too. The flight was uneventful, bad service, seats are unbearably tight (I‘m 1´84 and can barely sit) but I had expected something like this.

### "service is not good"
The Vueling Airlines flight itself was fine. but then the drama started once landed in Brussels. Our luggage still appeared to be in Rome this is a common problem appeared at Vueling. I came back Friday night and still waiting for my luggage. Vueling will not contact us and though their numbers are not in use, or they make you wait an hour at the customer service, I need my suitcase. My tip not to fly with Vueling, the service is not good or customer friendly forget it.

### "cheerful and polite"
Flight out from Cardiff to Malaga on 15th October and back on 20th October. Both on time and full. Provided you pay a small supplement to reserve your seats online you are able to print your e-tickets weeks in advance (otherwise its a mere 2 days). As you would expect, a Spanish airline employs Spanish flight crew so the loudspeaker announcements were always a guessing-game as to what was being said even when in English. Having said that they were cheerful and polite. The cabin crew going out was a bit slow with the trolley but the return crew were up and running. It may have been the same plane out and back, or merely 2 old A320's but it was clean and no more (un)comfortable than any other cheap (or not) flight carrier. You don't get much leg room for us 6 footers. The Vueling check-in desks at Malaga were a joy. 6 o'clock in the morning, but they had 6 desks in action. I doubt we waited more than 10 minutes. I only had one very small hand luggage but I noticed other passengers with sizeable bags which looked considerably bigger than other cut-price airlines. The worst thing I can say about the flights is they were uneventful.

### "worst cabin crew service"
The worst cabin crew service I have ever encountered The cabin crew would not let me sit back down in my seat for 25 minutes after I got up to use the facilities. They kept me standing in the aisle and told me I would have to wait. It was only after the other customers on the plane started to complain about my treatment that they let me sit back down. I am sure that this contravenes air safety regulations.

### "really cheap fares"
This was the second time we have flown Vueling in 4 days and thought perhaps the first flight we were just lucky but this last flight just confirmed what a great experience we had. Professional, friendly and accomodating. Printed boarding passes at airport and no charge. Boarding was a smooth and quick process. Dozens of desks open at checkin so little waiting. Seats as spacious as other airlines. Great choice of onboard snacks and friendly staff. All this with really cheap fares. No comparison with Easyjet, where we were treated like cattled. Would choose Vueling above the others.

### "lost luggage for 4 days"
Porto to Bilbao via Barcelona with Vueling Airlines. Cancelled aircraft, constantly changing gates, incredibly disorganized ground personnel, lost luggage for 4 days and a very disinterested call center. Was told that my luggage wasn't that important, others came first. Was told there was a 50/50 chance it would arrive before we left for our next destination. They did offer to send our luggage home, even though we were only in the first week of a month long trip. No issues with the actual aircraft or crew. Would I ever fly them again, no. Actually took a train for part of the trip to avoid flying with them.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Marrakech to Barcelona with Vueling Airlines, and I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was great, the flight was fine, we arrived a few minutes late but departure had been delayed by about 15 minutes. Baggage arrived promptly in Barcelona and there was no lost baggage. I will fly with Vueling Airlines again if the opportunity arises.

### "very annoying music being played"
Madrid to Alicante via Barcelona with Vueling Airlines. Both flights were full and arrived on time. The first leg had old style seats with the magazine pouch at the bottom which gives very restricted leg room, the second leg with new seats pouch at top - the same seat pitch but more comfortable leg space. From Barcelona we had very annoying music being played for the whole 50 minutes, not really what you need at 11 o'clock at night.

### "lack of attention and concerns"
Vueling Airlines lost my baggage from Rome to Catania. Instead of having a short vacation in Catania, I had to go back and forth to the airport Lost and Baggage counter to check if my baggage has arrived or not. The website that they gave to check the status of my baggage is useless. It doesn't even give you any update. I don't know how these people can sleep due to their lack of attention and concerns on their customers. I am so mad that I had to endure having a pair of shirt and pant for 3 days now. Until now my baggage has no update at all and I am flying to Malta early morning. If I can give a zero rating then I would.

### "try to avoid as much as I can"
Most frustrating treatment from Vueling Airlines, flying from Nice to Palma de Mallorca via Barcelona. As Platinum Cardholder with Iberia (One World Emerald), and having purchased tickets as Iberia, there was no recognition whatsoever. No extra Baggage allowance. No entry to the lounge in Nice. No priority boarding. No attention onboard. Even the though it was supposed to be a Codeshare flight, and all One World connections are with Vueling Airlines between BCN and PMI, Vueling are not One World Members and obviously have no interest in being part of. I will try to avoid as much as I can flying with them..

### "staff were delightful"
I made three airline booking on Expedia as part of a European trip and all three were with Vueling. To my pleasant surprise all three were excellent. We flew Budapest to Rome, then Rome to Palermo and back to Rome from Palermo. All check ins smooth and efficient. The flights were full but left and arrived ahead of time. The staff were delightful, curious and attentive. Luggage was correctly tagged and delivered on the carousal in an acceptable time. The aircraft were clean well maintained in the cabin. The seats are cramped but what do you want for a $5 one way Rome to Palermo .. yes $5 plus taxes of about $40.

### "experience was a nightmare"
Awful for musicians and tall people. I was flying Vueling Airlines with my tenor saxophone in a low-profile hard case. Apparently, Vueling's policy is never to accept instruments in hard cases. I have flown over a dozen times, both short international flights and transatlantic, with this instrument, and have never once been disallowed to bring it as a carry-on (it fits in the overhead bins just fine, even on smaller aircraft). I was forced to check it (and pay 45 euros, adding insult to injury), and, of course, my horn was significantly damaged when I got it back. The seats are unbelievably close together. I'm a somewhat tall person (6ft), and my knees touched the seat in front of me when it was fully upright. What's worse, unlike other budget airlines (EasyJet, RyanAir, Southwest) the seats can still recline, meaning the man in front of my was able to squeeze me even further in my sea - I had to have my legs spread wide the entire flight, which was actually painful. I should mention that the French employee who told me I had to check my instrument was very helpful and sympathetic. Otherwise, my experience with Vueling was a nightmare.

### "no explanation or apology"
I don't understand how Vueling Airlines is permitted to operate. For four consecutive days, they flew from Florence to Gatwick without the passengers luggage. I have just been informed by a carrier that my case which I checked in on 1/10/15 will be returned to me tomorrow. To date there has been absolutely no explanation or apology from the airline. Had we been informed that our luggage would not be loaded, we would not have flown. Enormous inconvenience has been incurred by this, and yet Vueling Airlines do not have the decency to even acknowledge the problem.

### "struggled to get hold of staff"
I had to cancel my Vueling Airlines flight due to unforseen circumstances. I deliberately took out additional insurance coverage for cancellation of flights. I struggled for 5 days before the flight to get hold of Vueling Airlines staff, visited their 'office' at Casablanca airport during the afternoon without success, phoned incessively, mailed, no response. I assume I will forfeit the thousands of rands lost.

### "service great, polite staff"
I flew with Vueling Airlines from Birmingham to Barcelona and the service was great, polite staff. The plane set off a little bit later than scheduled because there was a slight problem with a holidayer beforehand. Coming back was a major problem, we tried to get onboard but they closed the gates just 10 minutes before we got there, and only one their colleagues helped us with info. A nightmare towards the end!

### "never fly with them again"
The customer service is a joke. Staff is rude and uncommunicative. We bought our tickets at the sales desk at the airport after missing our previous flight. We were told they had 29 seats left. Unfortunately at the check in desk we were told there were no more seats available and put us on standby, the booking systems were screwed but no apologies. To make matters worse the flight was 2.5 hours late, they changed the boarding gates 4 times, all the time there was no communication  from staff. I got onto the flight in the end, only just but the stress of the previous 2.5 hours was the worst in my life. I will never fly with them again.

### "last year they also lost my bag"
First leg from Malaga to Barcelona more than three hours delay, when I finally arrived in Nice with a further more than one hour delay my bag went missing. It took them nearly three days before I got it back. Information was useless and even though there are many flights a day between the airports used their logistics are terrible. Vueling Airlines to be avoided at all cost. Last year they also lost my bag between Barcelona and Naples.

### "I have pros and cons"
By the time I've flown with Vueling Airlines I have pros and cons. I have to say that the flight Barcelona to London on the A320 was new and very clean. However,  the return flight the plane was very old and uncomfortable, plus the seats could not recline.

### "huge wait between bag drops"
Vueling Airlines didn't start boarding until 15 minutes before supposed take off without telling anyone what was the hold up! Took the bags over an hour to come through the conveyer belt, came in three different stages and there was a huge wait between the all three bag drops. We had to pay 50 Euros as we were late to our estimated check in time at the hotel, as our bags did not come through for more than an hour after our flight landed, which was also late.

### "I had a 9 hour delay"
As others have stated, do not use Vueling Airlines. I had a 9 hour delay from Madrid to Paris with no explanations from Vueling. If you have time to waste at the airport then Vueling Airlines is just what you want.

### "our baggage did not come out"
My wife and I took Vueling flight from Paris Orly to Vienna via Rome on 1 October. Upon arrival in Vienna, we realized that our baggage did not come out from the conveyor. I rushed out to the ground handling office to file a report. The officer record the report and gave the lost report document and mentioned that it will be delivered in 24 hours. I am not happy but I have no choice. The next day I called to follow up and the reponse surprised me: there is no information of the baggage! How could that be possible? The baggages are tagged, computerized recorded and transported using a registered airline, but somehow no one can get any information of where it is! However, since it is not yet 24 hours, I decided to wait. And as expected, day 2 passed in silence. I revisited the ground handling office in day 3 and again surprised me by saying that they will contact their colleagues in Paris and Rome. Weren't they supposed to do that since day 1? Will they ever move if I didn't show up? Later in the evening I sent email and received a shocking answer: a request to inform detail of what inside the bags, to help the identification. Are they now going to open the bag? I don't whether they are allowed to do that but I clearly showed that there is something not right. Later, evening of day 4, I received a phone call saying thay the baggages are found and will be delivered between 21.30 to midnight. Of course, I receive it on midnight. And as I guessed, it showed how the handling was done in poor manner. Broken handle, the wheels are hardly move, dirty, scratches because the cover is gone. Vueling will not be my ever choice to fly with.

### "lost our luggage twice"
Vueling Airlines lost our luggage twice. We flew with them from Paris to Ibiza they lost our luggage, and after calling them 4 times they could not tell us where our luggage even was. We had to drive back to the airport to get an answer. We unfortunately had to take them from Ibiza to Madrid then Madrid to Paris. When we first arrived to the airport in Ibiza I asked the women four times if it would be in Newark (after our British Airways flight back) when we arrived, and she assured me every time that it would be sent straight through. In Newark we got the news that our luggage was "delayed again" needless to say it has been over 24 hours that our luggage has still not returned. I asked the women in Newark why this kept happening and all she could say was it's the airline Vueling. I will never fly with them again.

### "missing all our luggage"
The worst thing was missing all our luggage in Santorini. They did not send our luggage and nobody was responsible. They did not bring it and we went two times to the airport and Vueling Airlines was closed. We spent about 1000 Euro to buy essential and personal items. When I went to airport to depart to my country I saw our luggage in the office and again nobody was there and I came back without my luggage. My family had a flight in the afternoon and they took it and paid 75euro penalty to carry my suitcase to London. Unfortunately there was no answer to our call and email and in the airline website to pay the essentials which we bought. I hope that the people knew better about this airline and their carriers and do not fly with them.

### "overall poor experience"
We have never had such an overall poor experience flying. From the chaotic boarding process in which we didn't even know if our flight was going to take off, to their decision to not load much of the passengers luggage due to supossed weight issues, this airline doesn't seem to have a clue. Two days later they can tell us nothing about our luggage. Even the "Delayed Baggage" claim form letter has the Vueling website misspelled and of course they misspelled our name so we could not look up our tracking reference number. If you thrive on frustration , Fly Vueling and you will be happy.

### "it doesn't get any worse"
Vueling Airlines from Florence to Gatwick. The worst flight experience of my life. It was chaos with late boarding, and then on arrival to find no luggage. It doesn't get any worse, and if you have a choice, do not fly Vueling Airlines!

### "dirty, seat trays cracked and broken"
Absolutely horrible plane, dirty, seat trays cracked and broken, arm rest duct taped together. Boarding was crazy. Check in staff in Malaga airport rude and unprofessional over one kilo over weight between 2 passenger luggages which we ended up paying for. Before you opt for the so called low fare with fine print and tons of restrictions, check your other options. And the only reason I am giving a 2 rating is because the flight took off and safely landed.

### "had double booked 14 seats"
Vueling Airlines had double booked 14 seats on our flight. This meant the last 14 passengers to check in did not have a seat on the plane. I had booked my seat on this plane 8 weeks ago. Vueling Airlines told us we had to check in as normal, go through security to the departure gate and hope passengers did not turn up. In the end 4 passengers failed to turn up, so their 4 seats were given to 4 of the 14 people who were on standby. I was lucky and got on the plane. The remaining 10 (very unhappy passengers) were left at the gate. The next flight to Edinburgh was the next day. I don't understand why an airline would treat people like this. Taking people money then shafting them.

### "boarding process was complete chaos"
Boarding of our Vueling Airlines flight from Rome to Malaga was to begin at 14:50. At this time no gate was declared yet. The whole process of not actually telling you which gate you are taking off at until the last minute creates chaos. At 15:00 the gate was posted followed by a crazy dash of people to line up. The line extended down the hallway. The boarding process was complete chaos. I paid extra money for an up front seat 2E/F. Upon boarding the first three overheads (where our seats were located) are closed for equipment and various things, and the overhead which is behind our row is reserved for Excellence members. We paid extra for a seat in row 2 and had to go to row 10 to store our luggage and the having to wait until the aircraft had completely deplaned to go back and retrieve our luggage. After sitting down, two gentleman began to argue loudly in the row in front of us as seemingly the one man put all of his bags in reserved overhead leaving no room for the other mans bag. After that situation calmed down then an argument started on the jet bridge involving yelling and screaming that lasted for 30 minutes with two and three flight attendants joining in the shouting and the captain joining in as well. As soon as the plane took off, the crew at the front of the aircraft shut the curtains and isolated themselves from the cabin for the first hour of the flight.

### "don't expect much"
Cardiff to Barcelona return with Vueling Airlines - they got us there and back and didn't lose our luggage. Outward we were 30 minutes late, inwards it was one hour, not too bad as long as you are not dependent on connections. On the outbound flight we had what must be the oldest plane in the fleet. It had ashtrays in the arms. The seat in front was broken and would not lock in the upright position so I had the person in front practically sitting on my lap. Luckily there were empty seats so he was moved. Otherwise it would have been totally unacceptable to fly like this for 2 hours. The return flight was on a much newer A320 with the new thinner leather seats. Although still tight for leg room it was a bit more comfortable. The only reason we continue to use this airline is because it's the only one that flies to BCN from our local airport. Vueling is not so much a "Low Cost Airline" as a "No Frills Airline". Don't expect much because you don't get much. The only thing you can rely on is that they are unreliable.

### "airplane was a complete disgrace"
I travelled with Vueling from Reykjavik to Barcelona. The plane was 45 minutes delayed, and the state of the airplane was a complete disgrace. Trash from the previous passengers was not removed, rubbish under seats and in seat pouches, and the airplane toilet was terrible. It is unacceptable that you don't clean an airplane before returning it to it's home. Our hand luggage had to be stored 5 rows down the plane, there was no space. This was far from convenient. The plane was so small that I could not move in the middle seat, not at all. My boyfriend and I are quite tall, which means sometimes we can't sit comfortably during flights but now our necks and heads weren't even touching the top of the miniscule seat! Our knees were touching the seat in front with sitting up right, it's that small. When the two people in front of us reclined their seats without asking it became physically impossible for my boyfriend to sit in his seat. This is impossible for a person over six feet tall to sit in such a tiny seat, made more impossible due to space reduced further by passengers in front reclining back with zero consideration for others, and staff unwilling to do anything about it when alerted to the issue. Booking my flight with Vueling was based on great experiences I had three years ago with Vueling service but now it feels like I traveled with a budget airline that doesn't care about its passengers. Except that it's not budget at all, since I have paid  858 for two single tickets for this flight.

### "does it’s job brilliantly"
First time I flew Vueling and this low cost airline does it’s job brilliantly. The plane was a new A320, seats were comfy with plenty of legroom, although I did pay extra for this. The buy onboard food options were great and also healthy. An efficient operation and a pleasure to fly with, and the website was super easy to use.

### "very happy with Vueling Airlines service "
We were worried about our flight with Vueling Airlines due to the reviews we had read. We stuck with our original booking and are happy we did. The check in, flight, the departure times etc were all as advertised. Very happy with our service, we left on time, arrived on time and our bags were there to meet us. We were very happy with Vueling Airlines service and highly recommend them to everyone.

### "Vueling gave us no problems"
After reading reviews of Vueling Airlines, I was prepared to be delayed, ignored by cabin crew and luggage-less. Delighted to say, Vueling gave us no problems. Boarding commenced half an hour before taxiing, takeoff on schedule, and arrival within ten minutes of advertised time. Cabin crew were courteous and efficient. The aircraft was well maintained. This is our first trip with Vueling. Would choose to fly Vueling Airlines again.

### "positive comments for both flights"
Edinburgh to Barcelona return. My second time flying Vueling Airlines this year and positive comments for both flights. Flying on their excellence fare guarantees a front row seat with middle seat empty. Priority boarding both ways and unlimited alcoholic or soft drinks as well as other food from their menu. Check in was quick and extremely friendly crews both ways. Dedicated check in desks for at BCN, fast track security, access to the business lounge. Both flights on time and early landing into Edinburgh, ironically delayed as the airbridge had a technical fault!

### "needless to say no bags"
Connection time was too tight in Barcelona so I missed my next Vueling Airlines flight. Got a flight to Turin, then Naples on another airline after long queue. Needless to say no bags. We were staying in Positano so a long trip in hire car. Could not contact anyone by phone, even used local people to try in Positano. After 4 days website showed bags were being redirected but didn't arrive. Finally spent 180 euros to go to Naples after 6 days to get bags in lost property.

### "they lost our car seat en route"
I flew with Vueling Airlines from Manchester to Barcelona in August 2015 and they lost our car seat en route. We were advised to hire a seat at the airport in Barcelona for the duration of our holiday (a week) and to keep the receipt for reimbursement. Having returned from our break I contacted Vueling customer service by phone and was told to submit a claim by email. Two weeks later and I am still awaiting a response. I called the customer service line again and was told that there was no way to resolve the problem over the phone. When I asked to escalate the issue I was told this was not possible. In the end we reached an impasse and the customer service representative put the phone down. As it stands I am out of pocket by about £80 and have no sensible way of reclaiming the money. I will never fly Vueling again.

### "they lost my luggage"
Vueling Airlines flight was overbooked and the leg space was terrible. They lost my luggage and there is no number to call. Had to wait on hold for 45 minutes just to talk to main office. They had no idea luggage status or where it could be. Many other passengers did not get there luggage either. Vueling Airlines lost the luggage or it never got put on the flight from Rome. Unfriendly flight crew as well.

### "successive delays ensued"
We arrived at Gatwick to find that our Vueling Airlines flight (18.25 to Florence) was delayed by 3 hours. No explanation given. Successive delays ensued until the last time was given for eight minutes past midnight. At this point British Airways staff (in the absence of any Vueling rep) told us the flight had been cancelled as the crew were out of flying hours. We were accommodated in the Premier Inn (not until 01.30 as they had to wait for Vueling to confirm they would pay for rooms) and we checked back in at 9.00 am for an 11.00 boarding. We finally took off at 16.30 and were diverted to Pisa. Finally arrived at Florence by bus at 22.30. No apologies or information were given for the delays. We lost a day out of our 4 day break, and Vueling are impossible to get information or any form of compensation.

### "Flight attendants friendly and efficient"
Barcelona to Fez round trip on Vueling Airlines. Both flights on time and smooth. On the Barcelona to Fez route captain gave inflight information in Spanish, French and English. Like the "Hasta Luego" with a French accent. New aircraft and clean on both routes. Flight attendants friendly and efficient. Very positive experience (first time on Vueling) and a fairly decent value proposition when compared to the price paid for what remains a non mainstream destination. Like other low-frills airlines, no inflight information provided on screen. Would love to have a bit of extra legroom.

### "staff disappeared from the desk so we were given no information"
Having read your recent reviews regarding this airline and having recently flown with them on Friday 18 September I can only add my own dissatisfaction with regard to our experience. No online check in facility therefore only being able to check in at the desk two hours before departure meaning we had to hang about the check in area of Barcelona airport where there are few facilities with our cruise luggage. Called to the departure gate before the plane had actually arrived. Flight delayed by 2.5 hours apparently due to a tyre requiring to be changed but the staff disappeared from the desk so we were given no information. No apologies or in fact any communication from the flight deck regarding the delay or any other communications for the flight deck or cabin crew. The food trolley service seemed an inefficient system and was very slow so blocking the aisle for most of the trip. It also surprised us that we had to pay for snacks as we believed we were on a BA flight. We missed our connecting flight and had to pay extra to book on to a later flight which unfortunately was also delayed so we eventually got home to Glasgow at 11pm having arrived at Barcelona Airport at 9am ie 10 hours to get from Barcelona to Glasgow. This flight was supposedly a British Airways flight operated by Vueling and we paid BA prices. We certainly will never travel with them again.

### "generally disinterested cabin staff"
On outward and return flights with Vueling Airlines the cabins were tatty and poorly maintained and cleaned. No water in one of the toilets. The aisles were blocked by the service trolleys for most of the flight (and the attendants wouldn't move them), so in practice the toilets were largely inaccessible. No coffee outbound. Outbound was delayed by nearly two hours and return by over an hour. Worse, the staff at the boarding gate provided no information whatever about the delay. Generally disinterested cabin staff. Aircraft in all cases at the very outer edges of the airport terminals, with long internal transit times/walks. Worst airline we have ever flown with.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Our lost luggage was delivered 12 hours before returning home after a 9 day holiday visiting grandchildren. We flew Aalborg to Ibiza via Barcelona return. Apart from the obvious inconvenience, it cost us a considerable amount of money as well. Daily taxi fare to and from airport checking on luggage status. It goes on and on, however we are one of the lucky ones - Vueling Airlines didn't lose our luggage on the way home!

### "for 5 days absolutely nothing"
Four of us flew Vueling Airlines in late August from Naples-Barcelona-Dubrovnik. Our flight was 1.30 hours late, no communication from any staff. We arrived in Barcelona already to late to pick up our connecting flight but low and behold their next flight was late. So we ran across the terminal to make the flight but unfortunately our bags didn't. We put in a complaint at lost and found in Dubrovnik, sent quite a few emails, and had a local creation helping us out with the phone calls. For 5 days absolutely nothing then on our departure on the 6th day, we checked in at the office. One guy was asleep in the chair and the other person in attendance ushered us to the the other room. There were our suitcases, no explanation just a tagged note that they were sending them onto our address in Dubrovnik, well that was great, we had left it to fly elsewhere.

### "I missed my flight to Naples"
I booked a flight with Vueling from Amsterdam to Naples via Barcelona. When I arrived at Schiphol Airport I checked in for my flight at 7:00 am. When I arrived at the gate, the plane was there but a delay was announced till 9:05 am. There was no staff to explain. Around 8:35 some staff showed up. I asked them what the cause of the delay is. They told me that something was wrong with the configuration. I did not understand and staff did not neither. I informed the staff that I had to catch a next fight in Barcelona on 11:05 a.m. They told me that it should not be a problem. We boarded and were airborne around 9:20 am During the flight, the captain nor the crew informed us about the delay or apologised . Around 10:35 am the captain via the p.a. system: “crew prepare for landing”. The plane touched the runway around 10:55. There was no gate available, so we had to wait. Finally we had to go by bus to the terminal building. The crew was unable to inform me about the gate I had to go for my connecting flight. After landing the captain apologized for the delay. As reason he gave that the cabin crew did not had enough rest, so they left Amsterdam two hours late. In the terminal I found out that I had to go to gate B69, more than 1,000 meters from the place the bus dropped us at the terminal building. When I arrived at B69 the gate was closed and I missed my flight to Naples. I looked for a transfer desk of Vueling; there are two in the terminal. One was closed. On the other one two places were behind the desk. In from of the desk there was a queue of approx. 100 people. After almost one hour waiting the staff behind the desk could offer me a flight to Rome at the end of the day of a flight next day. The was no option because the ship would leave Naples around 5:30 p.m. Also was it not clear where my luggage was. I wanted to go back to Amsterdam. The lady at the transfer desk could nod arrange a ticket to Amsterdam, I had to go to the ticket desk of Vueling, 1.000 meters further in the terminal building. I went there and get my ticket to Amsterdam. After that I had to go 1,000 meters back to go to lost and found for my luggage. The lost and found desk was staffed by one to two persons and also there a queue of approx. 100 people waiting. After a while they said they found my luggage, and that it would be delivered on belt 6 in 30-40 minutes. After one hour it was still not there. I asked if I could file a report my missing luggage. That was not possible. I had to do that in Amsterdam. I boarded for my flight to Amsterdam. During almost all the flight, without any turbulence the captain switched on the sign ‘fasten your seatbelt’. As a result de cabin crew closed the toilets on board. After several remarks by passengers the opened the toilets. After landing I reported the missing luggage. The telephone helpdesk for Vueling was not reachable. Only an answering machine in Spanish. One day later I asked the Dutch agent of Vueling about the status of my luggage - they replied that the luggage was in Naples, and that at the end on that day it will be flown to Amsterdam by Transavia (that has the only direct flight from Naples to Amsterdam). Five days later I received my luggage at home.

### "definitely not recommend this airline"
My daughter and I were supposed to fly Vueling Airlines from Marseille, France to Rome on July 5. When we tried to do an early check in, we were told it had to be done at the airport on the morning of departure. When we tried to check in at the desk, we were informed that the flight was cancelled. No explanation was given nor offer of a refund. Since we had trains to catch in Rome and other schedules to keep, we bought airline tickets on another airline. Since we missed our train connections, we also had to buy new tickets. We have had no satisfaction from Vueling Airlines even though our travel agent has tried to connect with them. I would definitely not recommend this airline to any traveler.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Vueling Airlines was the worst nightmare. My suitcase didn't arrive to Barcelona. All they gave me after hours of waiting was a small torn paper with the information I gave them, and the last paragraph saying that they don't take any responsibility. When I ask them what are my rights, they simply said we will look for your suitcase. Aftet 3 nights I return to the airport, they were totally unfriendly, said they did not know where it is. Lets see what will happen.

### "never fly with them again"
Arrived at airport 3 hours before flight departed. Check in was open and had a queue of about 70 passengers in one line. Only 1 desk was open and took over an hour to get to us and we were about 10 passengers from the front. After eventually being seen by a rude staff, we found our 2 x luggage was 9.6kg and 10.7kg in total. He aggressively insisted that we pay 35 Euros for this instead of allowing it through. I insisted that I be allowed the curtosey of removing some non essential items. After reluctantly obliging, he still made us check our bags again and again inside the hand luggage box guide. Humiliating! Didn't have to deal with this at Gatwick. Only the start of our troubles. We were informed the flight couldn't fly due to wind issues -  a lame excuse for overbooking the flight. Around 50+ passengers were kept waiting for about 6 hours. We kept asking staff who failed to speak politely in return and got very aggressive when all we wanted was an explanation as to why the flight was allowed to take off without us. Staff then simply called out the lucky few passengers names to collect boarding passes who were selected onto the flight. They required no identification whilst doing this. Complete shambles. No interpersonal skills and very poor communication. Would never fly with them again!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Beware of Vueling Airlines hidden costs. I paid full price for my ticket all inclusive and with a random seat allocation. On my return flight, I needed to online check-in as a single passenger. However, the webpage informed me that it cannot randomly assign me a seat and only priority is available at additional cost of 15 Euros. Or I could try at the counter on the day of my flight. This would however incur additional costs not having your boarding pass.

### "Vueling mislead and misinform"
I arrived at the airport for my Vueling Airlines NCE-BCN flight at 07h50, and was told it was not operating. When I asked for an explanation they just said "it was not going to operate". I was checked in and had boarding passes. Passengers were given an alternative flight at around 17h00. Spent the whole day at NCE with 24 euros in restaurant vouchers. Checked in for the 1700 flight - went to boarding gate - surprise "delay/retardé". Finally we were informed that due to high winds the aircraft was diverted to Marseille. Meanwhile in NCE other airlines came and went? We were offered to be bussed to MRS so passengers had to pick-up luggage and head to the local handling agents office in the arrivals area. Once there, we were informed there was only one bus for a maximum of 56 people. They decided to make a list of 56 people to get on the bus - no lines, just people pushing and shoving hoping to get their names on the list. The so called ground agent wrote the list on a blank A4 paper - when he got to around 40 names, he was told by his colleague "forget it, there's no bus!". So we were then offered a flight at around 2230. For Connecting flight issues, they said "check in Barcelona". They can't do anything in NCE. Some people were sent home and told to return the next day. We were Given food vouchers for 10 euros for dinner. We finally boarded this evening flight. Arrived in Barcelona after a 50 minutes flight. I ran, together with other passengers, to customer service at the departure hall. There was a line of people, exhausted, waiting to be attended to. I was given a new boarding pass for my connecting flight the next day, a hotel vocher with accommodation and breakfast, a resturant voucher for dinner, and a bus ticket for a bus which was to take all the passengers to the repective hotels. We were told there would be a bus every 30 minutes. We headed there waited 2 and a half hours no bus. It was getting late so there were less and less people in the queue for the bus. Others merely gave up and slept on a bench or on the floor at the airport. I got "lucky" and shared a taxi with other passengers which Vueling offered to pay and head to the hotel in Sant Cugat (30 mins). Slept for about a couple of hours and took another taxi back to the airport. I finally made it home to Las Palmas at around 1530 on Sunday. Vueling has the worst customer care! They mislead and misinform the passengers. They have no customer service. We were misled and lied to.

### "have no idea what communication means"
Vueling Airlines have no idea what communication means, we were delayed 6.5 hours. Meant to have flown out of Florence and after 3 hours of waiting were then transported to Pisa where we waited another 3 hours! We were told nothing, no apology given and nothing in the way of food or drink offered. Once onboard and still no apology - they continued to charge for drinks. When I asked the hostess when we might receive an apology and explanation of the 6.5 hour delay, she told me they were in the same boat! (I think she'll find that's her job). When I asked why they were still charging for drinks, she said 'they had to'.

### "never use Vueling Airlines again"
I would never use Vueling Airlines again. I had a flight from London to Barcelona on 1st September, and I had to wait more than 2hrs in the plane, resulting in losing my prebooked shuttle bus to Lloret de Mar and make me pay €170 for the taxi as there was not other way to get to my hotel that night.

### "a return journey ...  and dreading it"
Our Vueling flight Barcelona to Athens was cancelled, no explanation given and had to wait over 7 hours, but we were given a meal voucher. We had booked extra legroom and promised on check-in for the larger plane that our seats would be the same with extra legroom on this plane, they weren't! The second plane was delayed, no ground staff arrived for the boarding time, let alone the departure time and then no information was given and the passengers were getting irate and for good reason! We eventually boarded the plane and the Captain apologised for the delay. The crew weren't interested in the passengers and endlessly chatted amongst themselves, ignored call bells and were more interested in sorting out their meals. On the taxiway, the crew by the doors we were sitting by, were still in the galley until we were at the runway. I am an ex-flight attendant and know how to open the doors in case of an emergency evacuation. Inflight service - Flight attendants walked around with a stack of plastic cups in one hand and a bottle of water in the other. We had to take our own cup and they poured the water. We were offered absolutely nothing else (paying or free) not even soft drinks or fruit juice. We arrived at 02.20 when we should have landed at 21.40, lost our hotel booking and paid through the nose for a taxi and had to pay again for a different hotel. Sadly we have a return journey with Vueling Airlines and are dreading it!

### "staff was very helpful"
Barcelona to Vienna with Vueling. Everything was okay. We bought the tickets a week before the trip and checked in some days before the flight, and there was no problem with that. The airplane was on time and boarding was pretty fast. We only had hand baggage and it all could fit, and the staff was very helpful and nice. We didn't try the meals but they have plenty options. I would recommend them.

### "poor at communicating"
Vueling Airlines flight from Florence to London Gatwick. The seats were broken and there was litter left from the last flight. Poor at communicating when the flight was delayed. We were given a coupon to spend against some food and a drink, but we weren't told anything about what was going on even when information was requested by several passengers. Because our flight was delayed we missed our connection flight from Gatwick. When we tried to get proof of delay flight to claim on our insurance, after 10+ phone calls and 20 emails later we gave up because we got absolutely nowhere and were fobbed off every time.

### "Vueling has no customer service"
My wife and I were flying from from Paris to Granada. When we arrived in Granada our bags didn't. We went to the desk and filled out the forms necessary to find ur bags. My wife's bag arrived the next day. It has now been over a week,we are back in the US and my luggage hasn't arrived. We contacted Vueling every day and were told it would be there either that day or the next. When we arrived in the airport in Madrid for our flight on a different airline we went to Vueling lost luggage counter and were told that our luggage had been located and would be headed to Miami later the same day. That was three days ago and still no luggage. We had to call Spain to try to find out where the bag was and received no satisfaction. The person said they thought it was still in Granada but wasn't sure and we could call back in a day or two, at our expense for an overseas call. My opinion is Vueling has no customer service.

### "reasonable except for the delay "
I had a recent flight from Barcelona to Nice with Vueling. I selected their Excellence seat as it was only another 80 Euro on top of around 70 Euro. With this fare you are automatically checked in with a seat selection of 1A, Vueling ensure no other passenger is sat next to you, and you get access to the business lounge (where applicable). You also get priority check-in and security. I arrived to Barcelona airport and waltzed through the check-in and security with no issues. The business lounge at Barcelona was clean and comfortable with plenty of snacks and refreshments (alcohol if one wished). Our departure was delayed for around 1.5 hours with no updates from the ground staff until the plane arrived from the previous flight (I had to check on a flight updates website to know how much it was delayed by). Boarding was relatively quick, plane was comfortable, and staff were pleasant and could speak both English and Spanish. Food was appropriate for a budget airline (the fare includes a selection from the menu). All in all a reasonable flight except for the delay and lack of information.

### "impossible to use if you have time constraints"
Same review could be written for all the 6 Vueling flights I booked in the last 3 months. This will definitely be the last. Always at least 1h delay, never warned in advance, no assistance, no one to speak to. Once I called the call center to add a pet ticket, they told me they sold the 2 available tickets on the flights, once at the airport the staff told me that this was not true and no animals were on that flight. All the times, after landing, the captain excuses the delay saying that it is due to the airport operations - always the same story. Unreliable. Impossible to use if you have any time constraints. Staff undriendly. Aircrafts old and dirty, as they do not have time to clean up after landing to reduce delays.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Brussels to Lisbon return and the flights were delayed 1 hour in each direction. The staff was friendly, the aircraft clean and seats were comfortable enough for the length of this flight. For myself it was a normal flight, nothing to say against Vueling.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Would not recommend. Staff don't seem to care about customer satisfaction. We were delayed due to 'an earlier delay'. There were no accouncements made, only one apology and staff were surly. All of that with an awful seat to boot. I will not be flying with them again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Filthy plane with old seating and rude staff. The seats were so cramped. We had to pay extra for luggage. On top of this they lost our luggage and offered no assistance whatsoever.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Check-in took nearly an hour. Cabin crew were unfriendly, newish plane, departure on time. No bar service due to the shortness of the flight. Change at BCN, cabin crew unfriendly with on time departure. Filthy, ancient plane, quick bar service-over priced.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Check-in took nearly an hour as there were lots of people in front of us, cabin crew unfriendly, newish plane, departure on time. No bar service due to the shortness of the flight, change at BCN, cabin crew unfriendly. On time departure, filthy, ancient plane. Quick bar service-over priced.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Quiet aircraft with very few passengers. Had a whole row to myself, allowing me to stretch as I looked out at the Iberian Peninsula below. I did not purchase any meals or have any drinks. Considering other low cost carriers I've used (EasyJet, SouthWest, ValuJet, etc) this one was above those. No IFE though.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
This is the worst airline I have dealt with. They picked us up from Santorini knowing full well that there was a fire at the Rome airport and that all outbound flights were cancelling. The plane was disgusting. Something on my seat (when I asked the attendant for a Kleenex, she looked at me like I had 2 heads). Gum, old fruit and garbage in the seat pockets. Crumbs all over the ground. The staff. If these people are being paid for their lack of service and stone cold faces, then they are doing a fine job. The seats, do not fly this airline if you are taller than 5.6", you wouldn't be able to move. Disaster strikes the airport and a fire in the surrounding fields causes huge delays. How does this airline react? Everything could have been made easier on the passengers if they were just given some instructions. But that was too difficult for this airline. There aren't enough words to describe the horror story of our luggage - which "disappeared" on July 29th and I have still not seen it (Aug. 26th). General Customer Service and Security of this airline is highly questionable.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Return flight to IBZ. Outbound 30 min delay, inbound on time. OLCI drama but at check in got 2 seats assigned in front area without paying extra for selection. Same on return. Check in by Iberia staff friendly. In IBZ just 1 counter open so line took some time. In general aircraft's were dirty, seats/bins/general appearance, it seems that aircrafts had not been cleaned for days. On board shop expensive, wine at 5.50 E a bottle, sandwiches if available from 6.50 E onwards. Limited options and from AMS service only started after 45 mins. Crew got halfway through the aircraft during this 2hr 30 min flight as they ran out of about everything. Staff were ok but not really interested. Announcements pre-recorded in several languages as a plus. Would not like to sit on these cramped seats on a longer flight. Bags 20 E per bag/flight extra, making it a not so cheap flight. If no alternative for non-stop flight it can be a good deal. Check for alternatives though.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
The plane was clean and the staff very friendly. Prices for drinks and food were alright but I dont think you really need any for a two hour flight. For short flights a very good airline at a good price.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Terrible ground service at Rome Fiumicino Airport. Long queue to send laggage after having made online check in. Very narrow seats. No refreshement on board unless you pay a fortune. Very strict rules if you need to change flight.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Our flight were like many other low cost airlines, quick check-in, on time departure / arrival, no baggage problems, friendly staff. The only thing was the space for my leggs (if you are longer then 1,90 mtr). Next time I will book a seat next to the Emergency exit. If you book for a bargain you know that you don't have to have high expectations of the Customer Service / possibilities after booking. Will never use Vueling Airlines / Iberia for long trips or if I have transfers on my flight, maybe the next time only with hand luggage.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We flew Orly to Lisbon. At Orly the gate was changed 3 times and the flight was delayed by one hour. The ground staff was rushing the plane boarding and failed to check passenger id's (security issue). Some passengers were allowed to board with oversized and overweight cabin luggage. One female flight attendant managed not to smile during the entire flight. Service was very slow due to the passenger bad behavior.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flew Amsterdam to Ibiza. Not worth it, even with the low fares. Extremely mismanaged, rude staff and provide no information on why/when planes being delayed. Point in case, the plane finally got to the airport after a 2 hr delay and the staff at gate started scanning boarding passes. 30 mins hence announced the flight was delayed by another hour for some random reason.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
When boarding in Sicily with my son, some people were told to have their hand luggage checked in as there was no storage left. This seemed to be randomly done as a family just in front of us was allowed to pass with two trollies, just as ours, although people in front of them already were stopped. As we were already 30 mins late, things were done in a chaotic way and they labeled my luggage in a different way as my son's. When I was telling them (communications if any was completely in Spanish!) they just kept telling me to get on the plane. I refused until the two pieces of luggage were labelled equally. At that point I already started to get convinced this wasn't going to be a happy ending. Taking the transit flight in Rome to Amsterdam was another disaster as for some unexplained reason, we had to wait in line for another 90 mins. When we landed in Amsterdam, my 14 year old son put his phone on while taxiing to the gate. The steward shouted very rude at him to put it off (of course he was right, but no reason to shout to a kid who obviously wasn't aware he was doing something wrong). End of story, waiting at home for our luggage. This was once and never again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Just returned from Fuimicino. On arriving at the Airport there were horrendous queues to the check in desks. It was impossible to establish which were the desks for those passengers who had already checked in online. Eventually a Vueling rep pointed us to the right desk. After 90 minutes we reached the desk which is a disgrace considering the people in this line had already entered all the relevant check-in details online. We travelled with two friends who hadn't checked in online so they went to a different desk but got checked in 30 minutes quicker than we did - a disgrace. Having spent 90 minutes checking in we were then told the flight was 75 minutes late. We went for a drink and kept an eye on the screen for the boarding details having been told that boarding would be from 19.15. However, at 19.05 the flight wasnt showing. We were baffled and went to find an airport rep who could help. Amazingly she was told the a/c was waiting to depart but it was only 1915. Apart from our group of 4 there were about a dozen others in the same boat. How can we be told at check-in that the flight is going at 20.00 with boarding due at 19.15, we monitor the screen for the gate details and the flight is ready to go at 19.15? We were one hour late leaving Gatwick on the outward flight which for a mid morning departure is pretty poor. On reaching Rome there were delays getting to the parking stand, delays waiting for the steps and to cap it all after a long walk to the baggage reclaim a further 30 minute wait for our cases. Needless to say we will never fly Vueling again and having seen some of the other reviews on this site, we are in good company.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I wish I had read the reviews before booking Vueling. It's the same story. We were supposed to arrive in Florence on Tuesday 4th August 2015 at 18.55. Instead we arrived in Bologna on Wednesday 5th August at 15.00 and then had to sit on a bus for 2 hours in order to arrive at Florence airport at 17.00. 22 hours late. Throughout these 22 hours we never knew what was going on. The ground staff at Gatwick didn't know either. We never once saw a Vueling rep. A complaint is also going to British Airways as I booked the tickets through BA.com. All BA could say was that the flight was operated by Vueling. I strongly advise BA to stop selling Vueling tickets. Another complaint is going to Swissport who are contracted by Vueling as ground staff. They were rude and unhelpful. Obviously not happy with Vueling but no need to take it out on the passengers.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Terrible customer service. I flew from Barcelona to London Gatwick. When I arrived at the gate, we were told that the flight was delayed and we would receive an update in an hour. Two and a half hours later, we still hadn't received an update and staff were nowhere to be seen. The flight set off over 3 hours late and no complimentary refreshments were provided. I logged a complaint on my return for which I received a substandard response not even acknowledging the points I raised. All subsequent emails have since been ignored. That was my first trip with Vueling and definitely my last.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
On Sunday 9th of August 2015, I was due to fly on flight VY8963 from Oporto (13.45) to Brussels (17.05). My reservation was made and paid for on February 18th 2015, almost 6 months before the flight. I made a first unsuccessful attempt to check in online some 3 or 4 weeks before the flight. At the time, I was informed that I would only be able to do so within 3 or 4 days of the date of flight. On Friday August 7th 2015, I received an e-mail flight reminder specifying that I would be able to check in online up to 4 hours prior to boarding. On Saturday August 8th 2015, at around 3pm, I made another attempt to check in online, and was informed that online check-in was impossible less than 12 hours prior to boarding and that I needed to go to the check-in desk. On Sunday August 9th 2015, at the check-in desk, to my disgust, I was told the following: “The plane is overbooked. I can check you in, but you do not have a seat. You must go to the gate, and wait for everyone who has a seat to board the plane. We will then see if there are free seats, and you might be able to board. There is no guarantee, because we do not know if there will be many empty seats, and there are between 4 and 8 people in your situation.” What was to happen if I did not get on the plane? If you do not have a seat, you must collect your bags, come back through security and go to the vueling desk in the main hall of the airport where they will try to put you on another flight. If necessary they will help you for accommodation.” At 14.10, 25 minutes after the plane was due to leave, I was attributed a seat. When I arrived on the plane, cabin staff were quite obviously also irritated at the situation, and I received very little help to lift my suitcase into the overhead locker, even though my hands were full. When I asked if they could hang my suit in the front of the cabin for me, I was told to fold it and stuff it on top of the suitcases. The flight departed at 14.25 – 40 minutes late. Some passengers were made to wait for 1 hour on the plane before take-off. According to my neighbour, the cabin crew made no attempt to justify or apologise for the discomfort and delay. The flight landed at 17.25 – 20 minutes late. The plane was so late on take-off that we were unjustifiably late upon arrival. It is common knowledge that low-cost airlines traditionally plan more time than is necessary for their flights. They like to fool their passengers into believing that they have arrived “conveniently” early. On this occasion, it was unsuccessful. Again, there was no attempt to justify or apologise for the discomfort and delay.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Customer service is non-existent at Vueling. Check-in was absolute chaos and then our flight was delayed for 6 hours. It was 2am when we finally left and we could not find a single Vueling employee who could explain what was going on, we felt abandoned in a nearly-empty airport. This was my first and last time flying with Vueling. Do not be fooled by the cheap flights-not worth it.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I boarded in Bilbao where I was forced to store my hand luggage in the luggage hold of the aircraft (free of charge). I guess they were in a hurry and there was not enough space for all hand luggage. I was denied the possibility of storing it in front of my feet. We stopped over in Barcelona. When arrived in Rome the suitcase was not there, they said it would arrive in the night. I tried the free toll number and also the paynumber, I probably called 30 or 40 times over 4 days and no answer. When back in Spain I called the spanish number and to my surprise my suitcase was in Rome from day one! They even knew the location of it.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
4 hours of delay at departure from Rome and 1.5 hours at return from Mallorca. No possibility to send an e-mail or to get a refund or compensation. Never seen a company without being able to contact via e-mail - only by phone for which one has to pay. They let you wait and wait. No customer service whatsoever.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Chaos at Vueling check-in. We took off one hour late after a change of gate due to late incoming plane. Seats are of some kind of horrid plastic. The Steward was OK but the stewardesses walked up and down in a ridiculous military style. The baguette sandwich was terrible and expensive. It is an acceptable airline for young travellers. Bring your own food and drinks.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flying to Nice from Venice via Barcelona, had a short layover of 40 minutes which barely gave us time to change flights, let alone the ground staff to handle our luggage. When we arrived in Nice, I had a feeling our luggage didn't get picked up - it was true. I am just confused of how Vueling could provide short time layover flights if they knew handling the luggages would be difficult! I lost one full day of my Monaco tour just trying to take care of my delayed luggage. I tried to call the customer services but unsuccessful. It finally came the next day in the afternoon.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flew Veuling Airlines from Rome to Palermo on July 19th and it was not a good experience. Arrived at airport at 10:15am for a 2 pm flight and took 1.5hrs to check in. They had one line for all flights. People pushing and shoving and many panicked people worrying about missing their flights. Gave us boarding passes with gate on it (ie. Gate D) follow signs to Gate D only to find out they have specified where in Gate D we are to embark. No one to help, finally saw information on tv screen. Waited at boarding area only to find out later that our gate was changed. Rush over to new gate. Boarding was to begin at 1:30 pm. No one is moving, no announcement to say flight is delayed. Finally take off over 1 hour late and that was the better experience! Return flight from Palermo to Rome on August 1st. Flight on time then delayed 15 minutes, then 1 hour. Finally took off hour and half late. Arrived in Rome at 12:50 pm took over 50 minutes to retrieve baggage! Told to retrieve at baggage area 12 only to have luggage come out at 13 - again no announcements. Needless to say due to the ridiculous delays we missed our connecting flight to Toronto and had to purchase new tickets home as connecting airline was not at fault. Everyone at Rome airport complaining about Vueling Airlines and the many many flight delays. Zero customer service.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I appreciate Veuling are a 'budget airline', but the service provided is dreadful. The price initially looks attractive, but if you want a designated seat, you pay more. Want to take luggage? That will cost you more. Want food or a beverage (including water)? That will cost you more. Specifically, traveled from Rome to London on 3rd August 2015. Flight was delayed over three hours due to late arrival of incoming aircraft. No staff around, no communication, just the flight departure board. Boarding in no specific order so it was shambolic. Seating was very cramped on an old, dirty aircraft with no entertainment in way of films, TV or even radio. Arrived over three hours late.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
They fly out of the disaster that is T1 in El Prat. There is no proper boarding system in place. Everyone was processed then we were left to wait on a staircase no less to get to the bus to bring us out to the aircraft which was in the middle of nowhere. No ground staff to guide or assist anyone. Onto the plane, where the staff seemed unable to cope with how to put bags into the overhead bins, how to even close said bins. After initial delay we were told we had to refuel so delay, then told we were having another 20 minute delay - eventually we set off. The inflight service was not good at all and doing a rough calculation in my head compared to other budget airlines their inflight prices are too expensive. During the flight itself, the captain made an announcement to say we were 20 minutes from landing in Dublin. However looking out below it was plain to see we were still over the UK and somewhere over South Wales. Having flown with Vueling five years ago from Barcelona to Rome it is amazing how the service has diminished so much.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
If you want to fly an airline that makes you think that Ryanair is a luxury airline, then this is for you. I am a frequent flyer and in all the years of flying I would say this was the worst experience I have had. It began with check in. I checked in in advance to save time except that baggage drop off took much longer than the other line. Much longer. The wait was close to 90 minutes. No informed staff to offer clear directions either. Then flight delayed massively without announcement and without staff to assist. And no food vouchers even. Avoid like the plague. Any savings you imagine making this worthwhile are not worth it.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Low cost - high expenses. Booked 6 times, four times the respective flight was massively delayed. The most recent experience: a 6hr delay of a 2.5 hr flight. Ground personnel were not helpful. When I asked for an alternative, I was offered a flight leaving at the same time as the delayed flight (not the original departure time) and flying to a destination 300 kms away. Ended up paying twice: Vueling tickets and for the alternative with a different airline.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I went to Rome for a couple of days, made the reservation 5 months before because it was for a very special occasion. For the flight Paris to Rome, Vueling sold too many tickets so when I made the check in at Orly they told me I was in "standby" which means that I didn't have an assigned seat and that I would probably be able to take the flight if someone doesn't come to the boarding. In the end I could not board the aircraft. So I had to go out to check in again for the following flight to Rome. The women from Vueling who gave me my new boarding pass didn't seem very sorry about the situation. No apologies, nothing, it basically seemed completely normal for her to make clients who paid a ticket for a precise date and a precise hour, wait an entire day at the airport. So I finally could board at 7:00 pm (all Vueling flights where delayed) whereas I was initially supposed to take off at 2:45 pm. A complete travel disaster with no compensation from the Vueling. The return was no better - 4 hours of delay! I did the check in online and had to pay 7€ to get a seat? Incredible! So now we pay our ticket and we pay our check in? Never happened to me before and I take the plane once a month ! I spent 2 days at the airport out of 5 days of vacations, that is a quite interesting proportion! Just to say. I also took Vueling to travel from Sevilla to Paris and it was a very enriching experience too. After the boarding the captain explained they had to fix something very quickly before take off. After an hour waiting in the aircraft they told us it was quite serious so we had to change aircraft, it took 5 hours to wait for another aircraft ahaha nothing you know just a couple of hours waiting without even knowing when we would arrive to Paris. Compensation and apologies from Vueling? Just for still being alive I will give a 1/10 for overall review of vueling. That's a pity because because Vueling was a nice company 3 years ago but it got worse and worse the last years and now cannot even manage the crowded summer season which is the most important.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
My daughter and I were had booked a flight to fly from Rome to Paris on the evening of July 29th, with original departure time at 18.35 and arrival in Paris at 22.50. Our intention with this Vueling flight was to return to Paris to catch our return flight from Paris (on American Airlines) to Boston on the following day, July 30th at 12.10pm. We arrived over an hour early at Rome airport and checked in without a problem. The check-in agent told us to go to departure area D and to check the flight boards as the time of departure got closer. We did as she told us and proceeded to area D. After waiting until anticipated departure time, there was still no indication as to departure time. My daughter signed onto its email notification system and shortly after 21.00, she received word that it would depart at 23.00. Half hour before 23.00 there was NO still indication of departure gate. I ran to the customer service desk in the D area where the agent tells me that it is currently boarding at a gate below us. So, we run downstairs, only to find a massive crowd waiting. As we waited, there was an announcement that our flight was canceled and that we needed to proceed to the arrivals area to receive further directions. When my daughter and I finally arrived at this area, there must have been 400 to 500 hundred people jostling trying to get to the one of three agents. It was chaos, with no lines or anyone senior from the airline to direct or provide guidance. After waiting for 6 hours, I finally made it to an agent only to have him tell me that the only flight to Paris they can put me on was the one that evening, July 30th at 17.55. Of course, with this we would miss our flight to US from Paris. Being stuck in Rome, our only alternative was to fly directly out of Rome that day.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
The service is shocking. All was well until 1 hour before departure and then there was a 2 hour delay. We went to the gate and the staff was clueless as to why exactly this was and said our plane was on its way. Another two hours passed and it's delayed for another 2 hours and the same thing happened 2 hours later - we were waiting and stressed for 6 hours. During this time everyone was crowded around the information desk with not very much information at all. At 23.50, our flight was canceled and rescheduled for the next day at 10.45 so we had to stay at a hotel in Gatwick. The next morning our flight actually left at about 11.30. Never again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
First flight was over 3 hours delayed, we were given non refundable €20 coupons for the next flight on Vueling - that we will not be booking. Arrived in Barcelona, promised we would be on the next flight to our final destination. We were not permitted on the next flight. The line for Vueling customer service was huge and unmoving, except of course when people gave up and left. Staff were rude and unreasonable, unwilling to help those that they had seriously inconvenienced. We have spent over 9 hours waiting for Vueling to get their act together as I write this review. Hands down the worst experience wth an airline I had ever had, even over one losing my luggage for 8 days.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
After checking through without as much as a hint from the check in desk we discovered an initial 2 hour delay. This extended as the afternoon progressed to an eventual departure 4 hours late. Gatwick airport information desk were very helpful and sympathetic. After several hours we were given a £5 voucher for food which at Gatwick purchases very little beyond a coffee and a bar of chocolate. When the flight eventually left the journey itself was fine. On the other hand the cabin crew were pleasant enough on the rare occasions that we saw them on the flight but spent 90% of the journey 'hiding' behind the curtain at the front of the plane, actively discouraging people from using the toilet. The customary trolley service was advertised in the customary seat pocket literature. 1 hour 15 minutes into what transpired to be a 1 hr 45 minute flight the service commenced. One reluctant member of the cabin crew somewhat hurriedly scurried along the plane avoiding eye contact and thwarting any attempt to eat by announcing when asked that they basically had no food, no ice etc etc.

We were travelling home from vacation and had booked an 18.50 flight with Iberia but operated by Vueling. There were seven family members travelling including my 74 year old parent-in-law. We arrived early, about 1630, and then had to queue for 45 minutes to check in. That turned out to be the most efficient part of the service. We got through security and headed to the gate, sitting down and waiting. We then proceeded to have 8 (I think) gate changes in the space of an hour. We had the ridiculous situation of all the passengers walking to one gate and then turning around and heading to another, only to do so again. My son wondered if this was some kind of sick candid camera Joke. Some time later we realised that the plane was 2 hours late. We never did find the staff to ask and I ended up ringing customer service to confirm. I am not sure whether the gate was the airline or the airport's fault but I will be reluctant to use either again. We ended up leaving 3 hours late and getting into Zurich just before midnight. The plane was an old wide body 767 run by Air Europe which was fine. I could not recommend or fly Vueling again.

On 13 July we flew from Amsterdam to Rome. At Schiphol waiting at the correct gate we noticed the plane was going from a different gate and had a 2.5 hours delay without any explanation. This change was only called once through the intercom. The boarding was really slow, one employee was doing nothing. On board still no explanation about the delay, only that we have to wait for 30 minutes more until the other cabin crew arrives, the cabin crew on board has reached their time limit. This took in total another hour, so total delay was 3.5 hours. During the flight we got a coupon with 20 euro discount for when we fly again (valid for 6 months.) We were sitting in the last row of the plane, row 31, right side. When the flight attendant reached our row with food and beverages, the row next to us left side, placed their order and we had to wait. My wife is pregnant and needs to eat every 2 hours. When it was our turn, we placed the order but the flight attendant informed us that the kitchen was closed. We will not use the coupon and this was the last time we fly with Vueling.

I have taken this airline twice. Both times it has be over 2 hours delayed. There is no priority boarding for "excellence" passengers at least not in my experience. Apparently "excellence" equates to nothing more than a velcro attached head rest. I do not care for much of their service but I do depart before my scheduled arrival time.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
On par with all the reviews for Vueling. We flew Vueling from BCN to VGO domestic flight with in Spain the OB flight was on-time and no issues with taking carry-on bags on the plane. On return from VGO the flight was delayed without sending notices via the Vueling mobile app. Arrived at the airport on time and proceeded to check-in and was stopped by Vueling agent to pay for carry on bag. Informed the Vueling agent that coming from BCN Vueling did not charge me for the carry-on agent could care less. Anyways paid with trusted credit card so I could call them once back home in the USA. Got to the gate and notice all the locals with the same size carry-on bags as mine were not made to check them in. Some had bigger carry-on bags that could be classified as checked in luggage. While at the gate no information that the only flight flown by Vueling on Saturday was delayed by two hours. As the night went on in VGO we went back to Iberia which was handling the Vueling flight as the Vueling ground crew left the airport. Told flight will come but if it gets cancelled you are on your own for hotel. Note Vigo is small town lacking hotels. Finally the plane arrived from Barcelona with a fresh crew and made a quick turn around. Since the flight was delayed 2+ hours by the time we left Vigo it was now 11pm. We arrived back at 1am having to wait for Vueling to located ground crew in Barcelona as most the Vueling planes had already returned for the night and the airport while it is open 24 hours keeps limited people on hand after 12am. The hold in Barcelona was not acceptable being that Barcelona is Vueling's hub. I would fly Vueling again but I will fly them with being sure to take morning flights in case of any delays also keep my trusted Credit Card on hand to dispute carry on charge for not being local.

Sadly this airline struggles to deliver time after time. They own the 'worst ever flying experience' tag after a 12 hour airport delay in Seville a few years back and judging by recent experiences they still have room for improvement. My latest involved a 3 hour delay on a hot Saturday afternoon. It was apparent that the 'delayed departure' time was never credible and sure enough no sooner had we settled in our uncomfortable leg roomed seats a further announcement was made. Sadly a relief crew had to be called in as the current one would have breached their permitted maximum hours of work had they continued. I addressed the issue with the captain and asked why he had not called operations earlier, surely he had realised earlier. Muffled response. I also suggested he chased operations after the relief crew also arrived after 'time'. The 150 odd passengers had to sit around while they finally got their act together. As a token gestutre they offered a cup of still water and a McD hamburger to those desiring same. Until incompetence and sub standard performances of airlines are felt in their bottom lines (ie they have to offer monetary compensation to their loyal customers) I see little changing. Problems will always happen, it is how you deal with them that ultimately separate one provider from another.

Let me join the long list of 'dissatisfied' and I use the term loosely, customers of Vueling. First, my bag was lost, on a 1.5 hour direct flight from Rome to Catania. They said it would take at least 2 days to locate it. No answer to any help line, no tracking system, lost and found at airport open 2 hours in AM and 2 hours in PM. It did turn up, but 4 days without it. Then, our 6pm flight from Catania to Rome was canceled, they put us up in a local hotel, 7 hours after cancellation. Best they could do was fly us to Rome in the AM, then a bus for 10 passengers from Rome to Florence. We arrived Rome 8am, no knowledge of any bus, agents didn't seem to care, finally left Rome airport at 11.30. Avoid Vueling if you have any choice at all.

Flew BCN to LIS on this low cost carrier. Great efficient check in took less than 5 minutes. Boarding was trouble free and we left on time. It is low cost so you had to buy food and drinks. A tad expensive but very nice food on board. Service on this flight was good with nice smiling crew. Great flight. Would use them again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Scheduled departure supposed to be 2.30pm - however they keep delaying the flight without giving the exact time to fly. There's no solutions for the passenger on what supposed we do. No clear explanation from the airlines of what's going on. Only one lady try to answer passenger question one by one, which very uneffective and unprofessional for airlines. We are tourist in Europe and thought using airplane will be faster way compare to train. Unfortunately, it was the other way around. It's very dissapointing experience using Vueling. We also try to change using other airlines however our luggage has been checked into the Vueling and we unable to take it back.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Bought a ticket on Iberia that was supposed to be operated by Vueling. Vueling brought in a smaller plane and said there weren't enough seats but the ticket would work on a flight 4 days later! Resulted in a missed trip to Stockholm and non-refundable flight from Stockholm to another city. Even though ticket was bought from Iberia, Iberia refused to allow use on an Iberia flight, even though there were several flights to Stockholm that day. Vueling had non-existent customer service. Was an economy fare but not discounted. Would never fly them again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Terrible experience with the service during boarding at Fiumicino airport. Flight was delayed more than 5 hours. Service at airport was disorganised and very slow. No point in doing online check in before because I had to stand in a queue for 2 hours to drop my luggage. For hundreds of travellers only 3-4 check in desk open. When it came to my turn suddenly they allowed people from the same flight to over take the queue because the flight was soon. I came to airport 5 pm when flight was scheduled at 7.25 pm and delayed to 0.25. Finally took off at 1 am!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
The flight had over 3 hours of delay. As the plane operated out of FCO the delay was in part justified by the mess FCO is currently in due to the fire damage sustained in early May. However we received very little information on what was going on. The cabin crew were superficial and the fairly old plane (2006) was extremely dirty (I found a boarding pass dated the week before in the seat pocked together with a collection of old smarties, crisps and the like). Legroom is ridiculous.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
London to Rome for a long weekend, what could be nicer? A 2 hour and 20 minute flight, sounds reasonable? Not with Vueling. The the stewards took a trolley down the plane past us - you've never seen a trolley move so fast. Then it shot past us going the following way - we imagined to replenish. The cabin crew shut the curtains at the front and that was it. They spent the rest of the flight chatting with each other. We were thirsty, hungry and cross by the time we landed. Then we waited for our luggage, and waited and waited. Nearly 2 hours after we landed it finally started to appear. In the meantime, there had been no one out explaining what had happened. Appalling customer service.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Thought the leg room between seats was the tightest I've experienced which made it a very uncomfortable flight. What didn't help was the fact that I was made to put my backpack under the seat in front of me as the overhead lockers were full of people who had put their large cases there instead of in the baggage hold. It was my first time flying with them and definitely my last.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Very poor service. The flight number and destination never came on the screen, it stated it was going to Venice which caused a lot of confusion. Someone in the seat next to me had had their seat double booked etc. The flight was delayed by nearly an hour but the cabin address system was too poor quality to hear any explanation or reason. The flight was nearly 2 hours but they ran out of time serving the food and drinks from the trolley which meant over 2 hours unable to buy even a bottle of water. The seats were cramped, the flight too hot and they played loud music right up to and during take off. Not a relaxing experience and I am not looking forward to my return journey.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Sitting here right now, the flight is already 2 hours delayed, its been techno and rave in the speakers since we boarded, which is great when everyone is trying to find your reserved seat which is already occupied, and after an hour here, still no info to why we still on the ground. At least drinks and food is being handed out before we even take off, so its going to be an intresting lift-off. The whole plane smells. I'm happy I dont have any connecting flights from Barcelona.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
The online booking went fine,  on the completion I was informed I'd receive 2 emails. I received 1 with a booking reference only. This was the first time I'd not been able to physically download a ticket with my booking or check in online - which worried me. I gave the benefit of the doubt and waited until closer to the flight to see if the second email arrived. It didn't. At this point I thought if I set an account up online I may be able to view the ticket online and print it. I filled in the details online, was sent an email with a link in to complete the set up. Clicking the link did nothing. So, I revisited the site and attempted to use the details I had just used to log in. An error message something along the lines of 'account has not been recognised' was my reply. So, I attempted to sign up again. These details already have an active account' was my reply... So, I tried resetting my password, which I immediately got sent through to my email I'd registered. I then tried to log in again, 'the details you entered are not correct'. After a few attempts at this, I gave up. I tried calling the telephone number from the website, a premium rate number. After ringing 3 times and being hung up on by the automated service after 2 minutes I gave up. I sent a message through the ask a question link on the site. Within 24 hours I received an answer saying 'We're very busy currently and it may take longer than usual to get a reply' That was over 2 weeks ago now. I've flown there had a holiday and flown back since. We went to the airport not knowing if just the booking reference would be enough to get on board. Luckily, it was. The day we came home we arrived with more than ample time before the flight to get checked in etc. Upon arrival we were met with large queues, considering the majority of the check in gates are for them it amazed me, especially at a time when usually online booking can be done with other airlines so easily. The airport has an online check in set up inside so I thought I'd do this to dodge the queues. 2 terminals were switched off with some sort of fault. the third was on, I logged my details the flight details came up all was running smoothly and then, it crashed. After 70 minutes of waiting in line, we were told that our flight had a separate checking in gate around the other side of the main checking in gates and that the agent couldn't check us in. Nowhere had it been made clear that this would be the case. No notes on booking reference forms, no tickets (obviously by this point) nothing - after finding the desk that was relevant to us we then waited a further 30 minutes to get to the front of this queue. The checking in lady sadly had issues with her printer which delayed us further. By the time we got through security passport control and found the gate our flight was going from, we had a few minutes to quickly find a few presents from duty free but couldn't grab a bite to eat as we had planned.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I was one of the passengers thrown off the Vueling flight on July 10th from Florence to Gatwick. We were selected by Vueling and assured by staff boarding the plane that we would be getting on a another plane and that we would get home "tonight". We had to pick up our bags and go back upstairs to wait with the other passengers who had been denied check in. When I arrived upstairs to re-check in chaos ensued where there was no plane to help out nearly 50 passengers who were stranded in Florence and no available flights out. In the end I had to fight with 6 other passengers to get a bus to Bologna, a flight to Barcelona and spend the night in the airport, to get a flight back to Gatwick on Saturday morning. Whilst food was on offer it was too late everywhere to get a proper meal, and no time. Hotels were similarly not an option. This was my return holiday flight that actually left me in a more exhausted state than I went to Italy. I should say that I travelled with Vueling once before about 10 years ago, Barcelona to Brussels for work. They lost my suitcase and it was never found again. This was my second experience with them, there will not be a third. The only reason I gave them a second chance is becuase I normally fly BA and I had hoped that they would have improved their standards.

Flight delayed 4 hours. No Vueling representative present at airport to explain why. Was also put on 'Standby' as they overbook each flight by 10% and as we were last to check in they moved us to a later flight as our original flight was full.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flight went very smoothly. No issues with check-in and flight departed and arrived on schedule, along with our luggage. Check-in staff and flight attendants were friendly. I expected a no-frills flight. Only complaint was that the departure time was changed at some point after booking without notification from 6.30 am to 5.30 am and I did not discover until I went to print our boarding passes a few weeks before the trip. But, still worth it considering the low-cost 60 euro/ticket cost for the non-stop flight, which included assigned seating and 1 check-in bag. I'd fly with Vueling again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I was on the same Flight as the last reviewer. What makes it worse is that a decision had apparently been made to leave or the passenger luggage behind. No explanation has been given to me. No efforts made to meet us at LGW (we were kept in bag claim for 45 mins awaiting our luggage). Help Desk does not answer and as of writing this, the lost luggage dept have no idea when they are going to deliver the luggage.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We had to wait for over an hour to board the flight without any explanation from the staff. Vueling then threw passengers off the flight list because there was too much weight in the aircraft. Upon arriving at London Gatwick we discovered Vueling hadn't even sent any of the luggage, it had been kept in FLorence without telling any of the passengers. This has happened twice in the last few months and last time it took four days to get my luggage back. I travel to Florence for work every 6 weeks and I will not be using Vueling again, I will use BA into City airport.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I booked several trips thru Europe with Vueling. The first leg was on July 1st 2015, starting from Orly Paris to Prague on 9.55am flight, arriving Rome at 12.00pm with a connection to Prague at 1.00pm. We arrived at the Airport 2 hours ahead of the flight time to find extremely long lines. Vueling process all flights thru a single line. We made it thru the line 7 minutes ahead of the departure time. As they checked our luggage and processed our boarding passes they advised us that there was no flight that day to Fiumicino airport where we have our connecting flight, but that it was diverted to Ciampino. Told we can pick up our luggage there and connect to our flight to Prague. The flight left 30 minutes late, arriving in Ciampino at 12.30. Transportation between the two airports is a bus that leaves every 15 minutes after the hour and the travel time is about 30 minutes. It was impossible to make the connection. Since the flight was scheduled to Flumicino our bags were labeled to that airport. We tried to pick up the luggage at Ciampino to find only one bag delivered and the other one lost. We took a taxi to Fiumicino hoping there may be a later flight to Prague, to find out Vueling has only the 1pm flight. We had to wait in a line for four hours to talk to a rude agent, that advised us that they would put us in a hotel and provide transportation to and from the hotel. We headed to the airport the next morning at 9am to catch 1pm flight. After 30 minutes in line we were advised that the flight was delayed to 4.30. Since I had the time at the airport, I went to Vueling lost and found, and fortunately I located the bag. While waiting for 4.30 departure, Vueling announced that the flight time was changed to 2.30 pm! We hurried to the gate to catch the 2nd bus transporting passengers to the plane. We waited in the bus for half an hour before they told us that the flight time had been delayed again to 5.40pm. The second boarding at 5.10 was manual since all the electronic boarding passes were collected the first time. In short this low cost airline, made us spend 36 hours connecting in Rome rather than 1 hour.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Terrible service! Our return took two days. Our first flight was overbooked and they printed the wrong paperwork. We were forced to spend the night in Madrid where they gave us one meal for a 24 hour delay. After our last flight didn't work out it took 3 hours in the airport to get new tickets and a hotel lined out.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Another flight from Lisbon to Barcelona and back without any issues. The only thing diferent was the necessity of checking lugage. You have to use the regular check-in counters in Lisbon to drop your bags and is not much better in Barcelona - which defeats the main reason you use check-in online. No real issues with the staff or the seats, you get what you pay for.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
They had no staff at the front counter when we arrived. After about an hour 2 reps showed up and then one of them left with no explanation and a whole line up of people. When I boarded the plane there was garbage on the seats. We then didn't leave until 20 minutes after our scheduled time because they allowed someone to board the plane with a large stroller and when it wouldn't fit in the carry on cabin, we had to be delayed so they could store it. We only had an hour transfer in Barcelona after this delay so I tried to talk to the attendants about possibly getting off the plane before the others so we could make our flight. They were extremely rude. Luckily we caught our flight but our baggage got lost somewhere en route.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Customer service non existent, ground staff at destination rude and unwilling to help. We booked on Iberia, but found ourselves on Vueling as they code share with Iberia. The trip got off to a good start as the ground staff at Gatwick were competent and booked us in. From there everything went downhill, cabin crew provided very little information during the flight and just seemed to be there because they had to be. Once we landed we were kept on the aircraft for over 30 mins after the doors were opened without any explanation. Eventually once inside the terminal in took about 2hrs for the luggage to arrive and still no explanation/information from the ground staff. When we finally got our luggage we went to see the Vueling desk at the terminal, staff at the airport were very rude .

### Vueling Airlines customer review
It's cheap but never again. It may have also been due to the set-up at the airport. There were no signs or attendants to ask where to check-in. There were two separate, long lines to check-in. The representatives checking in customers at the desk were very slow. We arrived at the airport 3.5 hours prior to check-in yet were still afraid to miss our flight. Suddenly a new line would open up for people who had a flight whose gate was closing soon. People would just cut and shove each other in line out of confusion. There was no control; just pure chaos. When customers would try to ask attendants where they need to go, they would answer rudely and condescendingly. Now on the plane, I had a party of 5 people and only 1 of us had a cabin bag. We placed the cabin bag on the top of the seat in the designated compartment which fitted and was able to close easily. The stewardess comes over tries to move the bag when it was already fitted and rudely attempts to shove and move my bag rows away from me when no one else needed to put their bag up. She was so rude to me. We were not provided any beverages or snacks, even water. Stay away from Vueling Airlines.

First flight 2 hrs late, second flight cancelled, third flight so far delayed - after fourth (if I make the connection) will never use them again. Savings not worth aggravation - and not helped by website that is useless half the time.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Rarely do we have any problems on a Vueling flight, and this was no exception. Easy check in, not too far to walk at BCN, and speedy boarding with on time departure. Seats are on a par with pretty much any European low cost carrier or one of the legacy airlines' economy offerings these days. Incredibly quick baggage arrival at A Coruna, though, to be fair we were the only plane in! Prices/quality of food and drink on board seem better than the likes of Ryanair, though just one observation, why on a 80 minute flight, at lunch time do the cabin crew sit and talk amongst themselves at the back for 40 mins, rather than getting the trolley out to feed hungry/thirsty mouths? Overall, Vueling continue to offer a good product, with the advantage of a choice of fares, dependant on whether you want a checked bag, chosen seat etc.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Obviously this is a low fare airline, which means we didn't expect much from their service quality, or the flight comfort. But the thing that was extra irritating is the in-flight safety announcements. In two languages, on and on and on until we landed. If the flight was under 1hour, it felt like 45 mins of it we listened to the announcements. And when we weren't, there was a background music!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
EDI to BCN on 18th June and BCN to EDI on the 27th. Excellent fare with Vueling. Flight left on time. Lovely crew and free choice of drinks and food from the menu. Return flight from Barcelona includes priority check in, fast track security, access to business lounge and priority boarding. Drink before take off and unlimited free food and drink during the flight and arrived on time. Can't really fault the service and was concerned about flying with Vueling due to previous bad reviews. Already booked up for another flight to Barcelona in September. Very impressed!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Booking was easy and transparent, paid 168€ for Barcelona-Malaga return. I bought Optima fare which gives 23k hold luggage and seat selection. Later added sports equipment for reasonable charge. Printed boarding passes at home. Friendly and fast baggage drop-off. Boarding was on time, planes had clean interior and were in good condition, no duct tape noted. Departures within booked times, arrivals on time or 10' earlier. FAs friendly, professional and smiling. Seat pitch tight but it was expected. Inflight magazine was interesting. Did not buy anything from BOB but prices seemed comparable with other companies. Luggage delivered in reasonable times at both airports.

When we arrived in Palermo airport, our flight to Rome had been canceled (code-share flights with BA). No notice us at all. We suddenly lost the Rome bound airplane. We lost Japan bound for international flight of subsequent connections, even lost the Japan domestic connection flight. We had to purchase a new all airline ticket that day. This airline is really awful.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Vueling is the worst. I had a flight scheduled from Rome to Athens - with fear that it would be cancelled, I arrived 7 hours early so as to have notice and ability to buy an alternative flight. I stood in line for 1 hour to check in, and was told I was too early. Finally checked in 3 hours early, only to find a change in the gate departure time to 20:20 from 19:30. Nobody at the gate to answer questions. No staff arrived until 21:00 at which point we were all rushed onto a plane. We circled around the runway for about an hour, at which point returned to gate, were told some reason that we could no longer fly and told we would all fly at some point "tomorrow morning. I demanded a time as my entire vacation depended on me arriving by AM and was told we don't know. They did not know anything, not where the hotel was, not when the next flight would leave. I refused the hotel, am sleeping in the airport and have purchased an entirely new flight. This company should be put out of business for the way they treat people, their horrible ethics and dishonest conduct.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I promised myself never to fly again with Vueling the day they obliged my 85 years old mother to pay twice for the same piece of luggage (first she paid by internet getting no receipt and later also when checking in the bag at the airport) and other very bad previous experiences with the airline. However, I found a tempting offer to fly Bilbao to A Coruña at 0700 am to arrive 0805 am on 15/06/15. Weeks after having purchased the ticket Vueling sent our an email proposing me to fly Bilbao Barcelona at 0700am to connect for A Coruña at 1235 arriving 1420 pm. So I would be arriving A Coruña 6 hours 15 minutos later! It is a scandal. Their only comment: "Lo sentimos. Su vuelo ha cambiado". These are not chárter flights. They present themselves as a regular airline but later cancel flights as they like and you suffer the consequences. Nobody cared about the train tickets I couldn´t use and the time I lost waiting for the connecting flight. And a last treat onto my ass, I tried to book the seats free of charge but the airline proposed me to do it directly at the airport for which I had to be there at 0500 am or I risked not beeing accepted. Extremely high risk to flying with this airline! !

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Vueling airlines is the worst airline I have traveled on. I flew from London to Rome, and from Rome to Paris. Both times the flight was late and extremely stressful. The first trip was 3 hours delayed. There were no representatives from Vueling to answer any questions. After the 3 hour delay, we boarded a plane. The passengers then sat on the plane for approximately 1 hour before an announcement said we were then de-boarding the plane. Again, no Vueling representatives would answer any questions. After De-boarding the flight, no one was there to help. If you asked a question you were yelled at or lied to. I had to fight to get on a flight out. Avoid Vueling at all costs.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
The flight was delayed by approximately 1.25 hours. The unboarding of the previous flight was slow, especially since wheelchair assistance was not in place for a passenger. The ground crew was very relaxed, but never bother to apologize or communicate to the passengers the issues. In the meantime a very long queue to board - which seemed completely unnecessary, since boarding is by row - had developed. Once aboard, further delays and one of the staff members who was meant to assist with boarding was very aggressive. Language seemed to be the issue, and the flight staff was not able to communicate directions or provide assistance in English. What little English was used was very challenging to understand (announcements, etc.) Unprofessional. Uncomfortable. Late. Unapologetic to its customers. Will never fly this airline again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
One of my worst flight experiences (and trust me, I travel a lot). A long delay without any information to the travelers (we were waiting in line for check in for more than 40 minutes), and very little leg room between seats. I will never fly Vueling again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Similar to other reviews, experienced delays at Rome airport (apparently this was due to a fire in terminal 3 a few weeks ago). We were delayed by 2 hours, which I could handle but the sheer lack of communication from Vueling was ridiculous. First we waited for our gate to be announced, the time for our flight to depart came and went whilst still waiting at the boards for our gate number. If a flight is delayed just announce that it is delayed! Then people can go and find a seat, get a drink and entertain themselves. When our gate was finally announced we had to stand in a queue for well over an hour on the premise that we were about to board. No announcements were made about our delay, but the Germanwings flight at the gate next to us were told frequently how long they were being delayed by. The lady at the gate told my boyfriend we were waiting for a bus, when a bus turned up we still waited for another 45 minutes. Standing at the gate. When we got on the flight there was no apology about the delay until we were about to land, gave a 20 euro voucher off next flight, would have much preferred a complementary drink during the flight, but no they want more money off you!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
The worst airline, unless you place no value whatsoever on your time, do not fly Vueling under any circumstances. The tickets are "cheap" if your time and aggravation have no value. The two hour flight from London to Rome left an hour late, followed by a two hour wait for luggage. No one was available to answer questions or assist. Totally uncaring and incompetent. Never again.

Flight from Split, Croatia to Rome, Italy was delayed an hour. When we finally got on the plane, we sat on the tarmac for over an hour and a half. It was 30 degrees outside and much hotter inside. They would not let us off or turn on the air conditioning. They were nice enough to offer us a glass of water once every 45 minutes. Overall, our flight to Rome was delayed by about 3 hours.

We flew from Florence to Barcelona and Barcelona to Paris with no problems at all. The flight was 10 minutes late and they told us why it was late. The plane took off and landed smoothly. We had 2 checked in bags, they both arrived together with us. One of the bag was 23.4 Kg and they didn't fuss about it. I would fly on this airline again in the future.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flight from BCN-HAJ on 4th of May. Flight was delayed several times and finally cancelled in the afternoon. According to Vueling due to fog (which was there in the morning but had already cleared up until midday). No information or assistance from Vueling staff at all. Had to get back our already checked-in luggage which took another 1.5 hours. In the queue were approx. 1000 other people (several flights were cancelled that day by Vueling) and only 1 staff member from Vueling behind the counter. Could not help us at all. Next flight to Hanover with free seats could be offered only 3 (!) days later. So we also had to re-organize our flight home with another airline and spent one more night in Barcelona at our own cost. No offers from Vueling not even an excuse.

BCN to MXP. Boarding 17.50' the monitor at the gate said also an hour later. Nobody at the gate desk. Flight left more than hour late with no information or explanation let alone apologies. Normally would never fly a low- cost airline but this was the only option. I booked the best available seat at extra cost but received row 4. all rows have the same -virtually non-existing- leg space and with my 2 meter length I don't fit in these. Row 1 was empty even if I could not book it. Asked several staff if I can change but that was bluntly refused esp by the maitre de cabin who said I should have booked row 1 even after I explained that this was not available at the booking site of the airline. Never again Vueling.

I booked 14 seats from Cardiff to Alicante plus return in May 2105. I attempted to fill in the api form but it wouldn't save I was told that I could get my boarding passes at the airport when I checked in. On arrival at the airport I was told that we had to put our hand luggage in the hold and couldn't take on board I informed the staff that if I could have saved the api form and able to print out my boarding passes this wouldn't have been the case but it was totally ignored I felt that this was really unfair.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
The flight from London to Barcelona was delayed by nearly three hours with no announcements or explanations. Airport customer service agent was very blasé about the whole thing - call the airline customer service. Well after 4 calls totalling 20 minutes I still didn't manage to speak to anyone. Irritatingly the flight departing an hour and 40 minutes later left an hour before mine. Gate staff were unhelpful and almost aggressive when questioned about the delay. To add insult to injury when we eventually arrived in Barcelona and were herded into buses we were held at the aircraft until the captain and crew had done there final checks switched off lights and locked the aircraft doors. Only when they got on the buses were any of them allowed to depart. As a consequence my pre-booked car rental was unavailable as the offices had shut some time earlier. All of this culminated in my not checking into my hotel until 04.30 in the morning! I will not be fooled into travelling Vueling again!

Took a flight from Barcelona to Zurich. The flight was a little bit late due to bad weather but no problem. They are very strict with luggage size rules so follow them. All in all I had a good flight. Everything was ok. Recommended. Do not be scared about negative reviews.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
BCN-OSL on 4 May. First the screens informed us the flight was delayed by two hours. When we finally had boarded the FA informed us that the captain had gone over the working hours limit so we had to wait for another pilot and that it would take about one hour. After 1.5 hrs the new pilot had still not shown up. After another 30 minutes we were informed that the crew could not operate the flight and to leave the plane and wait by the gate for more information. Well we waited and waited and waited but to no avail. The lines at the customer "service" desk were horrendous. After waiting in line for more than an hour the one person at the desk didn't know anything and said we would just have to wait. It was now 6pm and we were suppose to leave 11.55 am. After another two hours wait we finally found out (after calling Vueling ourselves) that the flight was cancelled and to collect our luggage and go to the ticket Counter landside. Well to make a long story short - we spent 12 hours at the airport and they couldn't help us with anything. No food or drink no information and nobody knew anything when asked. We had to buy New tickets With another airline and pay for hotel accommodation ourselves. Vueling claimed it was due to weather after first blaming crew shortage and refused to compensate. I wouldn't travel with them again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
On the first flight the seat in front was broken and was reclined for the whole flight the passenger being unable to put it into the upright position. This placed me in discomfort and potential danger. The seat should have been taken out of service or the passenger moved to an empty seat of which there were several on the flight. The crew took no interest and shrugged and walked away. Again on the first flight the refreshment service was done in such a slapdash manner that neither I nor the other person in the row were asked if we wanted anything and when I tried to attract the attention of a crew member I was ignored. Now I come to the more serious matter regarding the BCN-MAD flight. I was travelling with hand baggage only as I was in a hurry to get to a meeting. I had one small piece well within the size and weight limitation. This was taken from me at the aircraft door on boarding to be placed in the hold as there was no space left in the overhead lockers due to an apparent lack of proper control of baggage volume for the passengers who boarded before. The Vueling employee who stopped me from boarding was rude and abrupt and not prepared to listen to any viewpoint. My bag contained a laptop two cellphones keys money passport and confidential and valuable papers. I had to remove all these and whilst I was doing so the employee was standing over me impatiently making remarks. Other airlines on which I travel regularly both in Europe and South Africa manage to control hand baggage in a more efficient manner and it is a long time since I have been treated so rudely and inefficiently by an airline. On arrival in MAD I had to wait for my baggage for 42 minutes after landing. The flight landed at 15.05 and the first bags were on the carousel at 15.47.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
4 May 2015 Barcelona to Stockholm. 11 hour delay! Because of fog in the early morning there where delays and the flight could not leave at the planned time. We got information that the new estimated take off would be 13.45. After a short time told it was 15.15 instead. After that the time kept changing. The flight took off at 23.55! Vuelings own information desk had no information about anything. The queue to that information desk was very very long. It took about one hour to reach the desk. No information. No organisation. No compensation. No food. Never again!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Booked to fly back from Florence to Gatwick on 19th April. Chaos at airport did not get on flight although checked in and luggage tagged. Told to take luggage with us and return later for more information. Did not get on flight so had to stay another night. One member of my group given back her boarding pass and got on flight but having checked in luggage there was none when she arrived at Gatwick and waited days for its return. Flight was very empty so why could we all not board? Very poor communication from staff and no reason given for delay. Will not travel again with them as it seems they often leave luggage behind.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We took VY6206 from Florence to Gatwick on April 19th and I was charged extra baggage to the tune of €220 then they didn't put any bags on the plane yes not one bag for the entire flight. We were told over the loudspeaker inside the airport at Gatwick after we had got through customs. Clearly they would have made this decision in Florence and not one word of it until everyone was safely out of reach - pretty poor service!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
2 Flights First from FCO to ORY on April 1 2015 VY6251 and ORY to BCN on April 6 2015 Y8011. This is the first time I have flown a LCC in Europe and honestly was a bit anxious but was pleasantly surprise both flights were on time and the cabin was clean and bright the cabin crew were efficient and pleasant. Purchased a ticket with hold luggage both times luggage came out fast. No IFE as this was an LCC and no meals included but there is a by on board which seems to be adequate to those who will buy seats were surprisingly comfortable. Adequate information from the cockpit and check-in process were swift and organized. compared to other LCC with almost the same price if not much cheaper with hold luggage included would recommend.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flying from Barcelona to Dublin on 9th April at 11.45am. On check-in no-one mentioned delays. We sat in airport until 9.00pm at night without a single word from Vueling or a representative telling us what was going on. The passengers on our flight were going mad. We were then boarded onto a plane but were told that there would be a further 2 hour delay and that passengers who didn't want to fly could leave the plane. We were then told an hours delay. We had not received even a complimentary drink at this stage. It was outrageous. I have never had service like it in my life. I will never book with this airline again. We eventually got home 12 hours later without so much of an apology.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I flew back from Florence to Gatwick with my daughter on 7th April. The flight was on time but the staff failed to inform us that no passenger hold luggage had been put on the plane. So everyone queued at the carousel at Gatwick for some time before an announcement was made that our cases would not be arriving that day. We are all still waiting for our cases and it is now Friday 10th April. We have not had any apology or contact from Vueling in that time. This is obviously not an isolated case as I gather it also happened on the 5th April as well.

AMS-BCN VY8301 3 April. Return BCN-AMS 6 April VY 8306. We flew Vueling before with not much issues. This time the checking via the website did not work website down all the time. The mobile app does hang as well. We were informed few days before the flight of half an hour delay. Then for the flight back from BCN to Amsterdam we experienced another 2 hours delay including an hour in the plane. Staff were rude and uninformed and refused to give their name. We arrived two and a half hours late. Customer service reply was sorry nothing we can do. The return flight was operated by an airline called Avion this was not mentioned anywhere on documents or communication Avion is even worse then Vueling in terms of staff and service. All in all appalling service.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flew from Paris to Lisbon and back. I am six foot two and so the biggest gripe was space which there is very little of. Manageable on short two hour flights but anything more will be quite tough. Flight attendants were very helpful however and let me switch to an unoccupied row so I could stretch my legs a bit and on the return an emergency exit row so I had more space. Planes were new and clean flight attendants very friendly and helpful as well. Planes took off on time and landed either early or on time. Effortless journey and found them perfect for short flights would easily recommend them the next time.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
LGW-BCN-LGW. Having had poor previous experiences with Vueling we were not relishing this trip and we were prepared to write another negative report. However this time we were not too disappointed. Yes the leg room is appalling and made even worse since the seats recline but I'm only 5-10 and I could cope for two hours. This trip was no better or worse than other "no frills" carriers. Check-in at Gatwick was very poor and the staff were slow and disinterested. Boarding was chaotic to say the least and this caused a delay. On the return leg it was much better. Easy (and early) check-in at BCN with a very pleasant young woman. Better organised boarding meant an on time departure. Cabin staff were pleasant and the catering was OK if a little expensive (captive audience ! ). We will be using Vueling again in September and we know what (and what not) to expect. We only use them because they get us where we want to go when we want to go.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
LGW-Barcelona. Weekend trip major gripes are the very limited legroom (I recall even Ryanair offering more generous legroom I am 6' and it was almost torture) and the inability to select seats online even though the trip had cost £120. In-flight staff are very friendly I purchased a tiny bottle of wine (seemed smaller than the usual small bottles) on the return for 5 euros not cheap but the wine was good enough. Boarding for outbound flight at Gatwick took ages and seemed disorganized on top of that the gate area was not heated and it was absolutely frigid. At check-in on the return I was told I was on stand-by because I arrived late and the flight was overbooked by 10 passengers. They did offer hotel and meal vouchers plus compensation and in the end it was a non-issue as I was able to board although I saw several other passengers left behind at gate. I would travel with them again for the right price but not before looking at other carriers first.

Flew Vueling 24 December 2014 from Paris to Barcelona and then 29 December 2014 Barcelona to Seville. Flights either left on time or a few minutes early boarding was well organised and bags arrived promptly. FAs were helpful and pleasant. Was nervous after some comments but was totally satisfied with both flights.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flight 12 Oct 2014 Rome-Brussels. Due to a last minute rescheduling of the crew (apparently the captain was told to fly to Brussels instead of another destination last minute) the plane departed with a 2.5 hr delay. To avoid giving the corresponding food and refreshments entitled for delays over 2hr according to EU legislation we boarded "only" with A 1.5 hr delay and made us wait another hour on the plane! Then they only gave 1/2 glass of water and no free snack. Apart from this incidence the space between seats is unacceptable you are seated like sardines in a can.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Chaotic policies and it's very difficult to reach customer service. We flew them last month from Naples- Barcelona then Barcelona-Mallorca and paid for an upgraded Optima fare. Our first plane from Naples-Barcelona was delayed. Since we knew many hours ahead that we would miss our connection to Mallorca we asked if they could change our second flight to a later one. They did not want to deal with it and just told us when we get off in Barcelona talk to the agents there! When we finally got to Barcelona we were told that our tickets were no good since we missed our flight so we had to buy two new full price tickets to get to Mallorca. There argument was that we made each segment as a separate reservation and therefore it was not their fault. They made no sense and hid behind technicalities. Zero customer service from each and every employee that we dealt with. Cramped seats and didn't even offer us water on the flight.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Round trip service from Rome to Palermo. Ticket baggage and gate agents were rude. The most disturbing issue is the random way the personnel assess fees for carry on baggage. On my outgoing trip I was told first that I had to pay an additional 90 euro for my carry on luggage - the ticket agent then said to take the luggage to the gate agent. The gate agent said the flight was full and I had to check the luggage and was charged 35 euro. After boarding I saw it was only half full - no one in my row or the row in front of me. On the return trip no one questioned my carry on until I reached the gate gate agent initially started to say my bag was too big then let me proceed to the plane with my bag and no additional charge. My bag fit easily in the overhead bin. A friend traveling with me was charged 70 euro for her carry on bag on the out going flight then nothing on the return. Clearly random protocols are being inconsistently enforced. I would not use this airline again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I took Vueling from Barcelona to Paris and back. I was concerned after reading negative reviews but my experience was completely positive. Check in was smooth and fast. The flights arrived early or on time and yes it was a little cramped but not much more than American whom I flew to NY. This is a low cost carrier after all so don't expect luxury. All the staff from gate agents to stewardesses were polite and professional. If you book early you can get really good deals. I will be flying them again.

Online check-in with Vueling was to me a total scam. I was flying from Cardiff to Alicante and when I went to check-in online it would not let me opt for the free seats. I am going to phone them tomorrow to try to sort it. What a dreadful site! Half the options do not work! This is obviously an excuse to rip off more money. I fly to Alicante 6 times a year. They may catch me this time but it will be the last time I fly with them.

LHR-Bilbao return. T3 departure was (exactly) on time for departure and arrival. Least eventful flight ever. Did what a short haul should do. BA Silver don't have lounge access Gold only. Return flight departed on time and arrived 25mins early! We were checked in automatically for return flight and because both flights were full Vueling offered 'free' hold baggage. Had free baggage anyway as flight was booked through codeshare. Late boarders had there bags put down in the jetway collection. BA tier points awarded (10 each way). Good way to get the last few needed to go up or retain membership level.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I have flown with Vueling Airlines three times of which the last was a round trip from Barcelona to Düsseldorf. Both the outbound and the return flights were more than an hour delayed and in the Barcelona Airport they changed the gate in the last moment making it difficult for passengers to know where to go to. It is supposed to be a cheap airline but it cost only a little bit less than it would have with Lufthansa because they make you pay €25 more if you want to have your baggage checked. They offer customers nothing on flight: no entertainment no snacks - the food they sell is quite bad and really expensive prices for small portions €6 for a tiny sandwich or €2.5 for a 15cl soft drink. On my return flight I wanted to purchase something to eat but they had ran out of everything. To be fair the staff on board are nice but the seats are totally uncomfortable. I will never again fly with Vueling. It is false that it's a cheap airline and for a similar price they offer you much better services in other companies.

I recently travelled from Barcelona to Palma Mallora and was initially sceptical about the airline before I made the booking because of all the negative reviews I read online. Fortunately everything went accordingly to schedule from the time we arrived at the airport to our return flight back to Barcelona.

VY8341. Our flight was from Amsterdam airport we arrived to check-in more than two hours before the flight and they seated us on opposite sides of the airplane. They said that the flight was full.

I booked flights from Amsterdam to Bilbao and then from San Sebastian to Barcelona last year already.

CWL-BCN-CWL. After a horrific experience with Vueling two years ago we were never going to use them again. However friends had used them without problems so we decided to give them another go. The outward trip was OK and only 20 minutes late arriving. However the return trip was pretty horrendous. At the prescribed departure time the screen at the gate just went blank. No Vueling staff to be found and no information. After about an hour and a half we eventually saw on the airport information screens (not from Vueling) that departure would be about three hours late. We eventually departed 3.5 hours late. When we boarded we found what must be the oldest plane in the fleet. Most of the seats around us were broken - every time the person in front moved the seat automatically reclined in our faces and crushed our knees. The result is that its back to easyjet in Bristol for us even though we only live 8 miles from Cardiff Airport.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Having read so many negative comments about Vueling I was quite sceptical when I was about to board Vueling from Rome to Athens. Well it was nothing like what I geared myself for. The plane was on time. The boarding was orderly luggage was checked in and reclaimed without a hitch. The cabin crew were polite and the plane ride was smooth. So just gonna give my 2 cents that it was good service and met most of my expectations. The only bone I have to pick would be the leg space. Thank you Vueling for making my Europe trip perfect!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
As I write I am sitting on flight VY8744 on 29th Sept 2014. The flight was delayed "due to incoming aircraft" for one hour following which we were allowed to board the flight. I have now sat in a freezing aircraft for over 1.5 hours while the staff try to fix a broken toilet flushing. No drinks or food are available toilets unusable and they will not lower the air conditioning power. Passengers are frozen and staff are huddled in the front galley laughing and joking with each other . A truly terrible example of customer service. I would at least expect regular status updates and maybe a glass of water but none available. Now we are having to wait for a crew change - 25 mins already. Beware.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Geneva - Barcelona 30 Aug / 10 Sep. We were booking a cheap flight 24 hours before departure. Discovered our credit card was insufficient and Vueling held the reservations for over 4 hours without surcharge while we sorted the problem. Excellent online and telephone service while this was happening and 1 bag was free! Certainly leaves other cheapies standing who systematically raise fares during finalization! Cabin staff welcoming and efficient. Outward bound on time return indicated delay 1 hour on the board but actually left only 5 minutes late.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We booked a flight through Vueling from Rome Da Vinci (FCO) to Lamezia Terme which is only about one hour flight and had an absolutely terrible experience. Our flight was delayed six hours! We didn't know until about a half hour before take off! Not only was that inconvenient in itself but the staff of Vueling handled it very poorly. Many customers were unhappy and staff were rude and uncaring waving us away with a free meal voucher. We had to ask many times and finally found a very assertive Italian speaking gentleman on the same flight to help us convince then to allow us to make a call to let the hotel know we would not be checking in until midnight since we do not have an international phone. When we finally got on the delayed flight the attendants were not smiling or pleasant as other airlines usually are. Also as soon as the first and only round of beverages was offered the attendants closed a curtain blocking themselves off and did not come back out until landing. On the return we ended up paying almost $500 for last minute tickets back to Rome on a different airline because we could not afford a delay. When we arrived in Rome we found out the flight we would have been on actually got cancelled! I know the low prices are tempting but look at these reviews! You will end up spending more money if you are delayed or cancelled just go with a more dependable airline.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
BRU-FCO-BRU. Both flights delayed. (~1h) During online check in the seat is assigned automatically and cannot be changed without paying. So if you are travelling in a couple/group be ready not to sit together because the staff refuses to change the seats even when at the airport check-in. Flight attendants speak very bad English. This is not an exaggeration. I had a problem with having no room for my carry on luggage and the flight attendant could not understand. Another warning - Vueling flights chronically lack enough room for luggage. (perhaps due to their loose baggage policies). You might have to be ready to have your luggage taken with other checked luggage right before entering the plane.

When I read the negative reviews below I was really horrified to have booked British Airways operated by Vueling for a trip from Berlin to Florence and back. However it all came out to be wrong! Both flights were on time accompanied by friendly and caring staff in a clean and modern aircraft (Airbus 319) with no problems regarding the luggage etc. Ok there's little space between your knees and the seat in front of you - but hey what do you expect by booking a low cost carrier? I can do nothing but recommend this airline when you want to fly safe and cheap without extras!

Online check-in with Vueling was to me a total scam. I was flying from Bari to Florence and when I went to check- in online I was told were no more free seats available and was forced to buy a seat they call xl for 6.5 euros. Obviously this was an excuse to rip me off money and authority for air traffic they shouldn't permit this.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew Vueling from Barcelona to Amsterdam on an A320-200 in July. I paid the extra 12 euros each for exit row seats as I am 6'4" and need the extra leg room. Online ticket purchase was easy including seat selection. Our flight was delayed because the plane was late but once it arrived we boarded quickly and arrived Amsterdam almost on time. The seats were fine for a 2 hour flight with the extra legroom. Flight attendants were efficient but not friendly. The plane was clean and in good repair and there was plenty of room in the overhead for our carry-ons. For about $120 each ow I thought it was a good value and would fly them again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I recently had a flight with Vueling and had a stop over in Rome. The flight was initially delayed 6 hours and then moved forward after 2 hours without any warning of any sort. Subsequently we missed our flight. Regardless of the missed flight the customer service we received afterwards from Vueling was horrific. Nobody made any effort to assist us in any possible way. It has now been more than two weeks after the incident and our luggage is still missing. My experience with Vueling on the day of our flight was bad but the assistance we received afterwards even worse.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I had a multi-leg itinerary with Alitalia Aug 2014. I picked Vueling from BCN-FCO due to availability. Check in takes a long time to due to the huge traffic for Vueling at El Prat airport apart from that I didn't have any problems. Plane was a new Airbus A320-200 very clean inside and leg room was very good for me. I purchased the Optima fare for 23Kg for one bag which was 110EUR. Chairs are good even for reasonably overweight passengers no complaints about luggage handling as Alitalia lost mine 5 days earlier FCO-BCN. Overall more than good for what it's worth would definitely try again if the same plane model.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I flew from The Gambia to Barcelona and then was meant to fly on to London Gatwick. In Banjul they could not give me the Vueling boarding pass from Barcelona to London Gatwick and said I should get it when I arrived in Barcelona. The plane was late arriving and I raised this with the steward on the flight who said that if I missed the flight Vueling would put me on the Iberia flight at 10.15 am. I did miss the flight but when I went to the Vueling desk they refused to put me on the Iberia flight. I then had to spend approx 2 hours trying to locate my luggage in Barcelona airport. The Vueling staff were very unhelpful. When I eventually got my luggage I had at the last minute to buy an airticket myself on the Iberia flight. I would never fly on this airline again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I used 2 Vueling flights yesterday between Seville-Barcelona and Barcelona-Zurich. The first flight was of a good standard as good or better than easyJet but the second leg of the flight was not what one would expect from a established serious airline. The boarding at Barcelona into a sub-contracted plane from Orbest (grupo Barcelo) was badly organized by unmotivated/poorly trained ground staff the leg room between seats was smaller that in the Seville flight the cabin staff could not cope with the overall services provided (printed prices for food/drinks were for Orbest passengers) they could not provide cold Cava and instead of published Orbest prices higher Vueling prices were charged. Flight left 15 mins late and docking gate at Zurich was at the far end of the runway (20 min walk to the exit. The whole flight was a very poor experience and poor value for money. I believe passengers should be refunded part of their original Vueling ticket cost when a sub-optimum alternative flight arrangement is provided. I shall give Vueling flights a rest for a while and will continue using easyJet which is run in a more professional manner.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We were due to fly from Florence to Gatwick. We were informed half an hour before takeoff that there was a delay due to a late takeoff somewhere else. Then hours later a staff member shouted out a message but as we were at the back of the queue we couldn't hear someone fainted. A fellow passenger told us that we were being diverted to Bologna because of the 'wind' this despite the fact that other flights were landing and taking off. So from arriving at the airport at 1pm two hours before take off at 15.20pm we were finally getting on the bus at 8pm and boarded the flight at 9pm. Almost six hour delay. I was with my partner and three children aged under seven. This was an awful experience.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We had our worst airline experience ever with Vueling and we are experienced international travelers. We were changing planes in Barcelona flying to Milan. The departure board initially indicated that our boarding gate would be announced in an hour. That message was later deleted but no gate was listed. My wife checked the Vueling mobile application which listed a gate. However at the gate the sign read Copenhagen not Milan. We found out that this was indeed our flight but the gate personnel would not let us board because the door of the plane had been closed. To repeat: no gate listed on the departures board wrong city listed at the gate so we missed our flight. We'll never fly Vueling again.

Buyer beware. Booked a round-trip flight from Florence Italy to Split Croatia. The day I was leaving from the US received an e-mail that my flights were moved forward three days. Problem was the return flight got me back to Florence two days after my return flight to the US. Unable to confirm if the original flights were cancelled or if I and my daughter were bumped because we had a low fare. Could not get through on any of their phone lines (even though I was willing to pay the ridiculous per minute and set up fees) nor receive an online response as to what happens. If this airline merely wants to cater to backpackers with no schedules good luck.

I decided to book my holiday flights with Vueling as the price was so much cheaper than any other airline at the time (half the price). I was travelling with my husband and 2 small children another family of 4 and a family of 2. After booking I read the reviews and thought "oh dear what have I done"?? I couldn't of been more pleased with Vueling services the flight was on time the queue was non existent the bags have good baggage allowance able to take buggy to the gate good hand baggage size/weight allowed the bags arrived safely at the other end no damage coffee snacks on board good seats clean plane etc. Will definitely price compare with Vueling again as I have not one single complaint or moan against them.

Barcelona to Venice on Wednesday 16th July 2014 Flight VY6404. This is the worst airline I have travelled on. Now I understand what sardines must feel like jammed into the same tin as many of their mates. It's hopeless for anyone 5ft 7ins or over and if anyone reclines their seat heaven forbid.

BRU-BCN. Flight departed from Brussels on time. Cabin crew was very friendly. I was initially concerned about the flight having read a lot of negative reviews however my journey was very pleasant and I have no complaints. Being 5'8" I had no problem with leg room. Baggage arrived safely in Barcelona.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
On August 1st we were booked on a Flight from Gatwick to Barcelona. I paid extra for a space plus seat and to find when we boarded that we were dumped on a Charter flight with an airline called Privilege operating an old 757 that was in bad state of repair. There was no leg room and when this was brought to there attention as normal no one wanted to know. The check in service at Gatwick was terrible and it took over two hours to clear the waiting queue. If you are desperate for a flight do not book with them.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flight from Rome to Alicante I only fly with Vueling if I cannot find another alternative and there was no other choice which tied in with the time we arrived in Rome. We paid the Optima tariff which allows hold baggage and seat selection thus meaning we only has small carry on bags which we placed in the overhead locker. These bags were then removed by one of the cabin crew and we were told to place them under the seat leaving no room for our feet. When I asked why I was told that room had to be made for larger bags which would not fit under the seats. So having paid the extra for a more comfortable flight we ended up with less comfort passengers who had not paid for hold luggage. A petty quibble I know but it is so typical of Vueling.

We were booked on a flight from Florence to Gatwick leaving Florence at 16.05 arriving Gatwick at 17.25 (July 26th). We were checked in and luggage was sent through despite the fact that rumours were circulating that the flight would be delayed. We then went through security only to be told that the flight had been diverted to Pisa due to weather conditions. The announcement was shouted out - no intercom or information on the airport information screen. We were told that we would be taken to Pisa where the airplane was waiting for us. We then had to collect our luggage get on a bus and were driven to Pisa. On arrival at Pisa (5.30 approx) there was no announcement or information but by word of mouth amongst passengers we realised that they were checking in luggage. There then followed a wait of 2-3 hours with no communication from Vueling staff about when or if the flight would be taking off or if we should go through security. Consequently when the flight was ready to board at 8.15 (announced minutes before) there was another delay while we waited for passengers to be checked through. There was hardly an apology no snacks or drinks provided and there were families with young children and babies.

On 30 June 2014 we arrived at Orly Airport only to be told that our flight was cancelled. Vueling offered us a flight to Barcelona the next day but we would have had to stay there that night! We were scheduled to fly to Florence and had our accommodation booked. They didn't try to assist us in any other way. We finally went to Orly Sud and had to buy a ticket with Easyjet to Pisa and then catch a bus to Florence. This experience has left a sour taste in our mouths and I will never recommend Vueling!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We arrived at Rome airport at 6.45am 21 July 2014 to fly with Vueling to Paris. The flight was scheduled for 9.25 am. Next thing we saw the departures board add an hour to departure. Then an hour later the flight was changed to a 12.30 departure. So a three hour delay without explanation. We waited an hour in the boarding queue with no further movement or information. We were them told that the plane was cancelled and that we would be given our luggage back and after collecting luggage - which took another hour we should go to the ticket office. When we arrived at the ticket office it was swamped so we had to stand in the queue for another hour to be given a choice of a flight at 7am the next morning and overnight accommodation. Which we accepted. We were told to wait near the ticket office with the other going to accept the alternative offer. So 50 people gathered for the bus that was to arrive shortly to take us to our accommodation. We had to stand for nearly 3 hrs until our bus arrived. The airline did not offer any explanation or say that the bus would be that long so we could have found somewhere to sit. I am in my 60s and am a post cancer patient so I had to sit on the tiled floor as I could not stand any longer. We were afraid to move from the area as we did not know when the bus was coming. We finally got to Paris the next day. The airline did not even offer us a coffee or water voucher let alone a meal voucher for the whole day of arriving at 6.30 am and finally getting bussed out at 5.15 pm. Staff seemed to be very unsympathetic about the whole situation.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Nice new aircraft. Quiet and clean but this airline discriminates based on your physical condition. This means that they sell you (for extra ) an "XL Seat" which is nothing more than the normal emergency exit seats. I tried to sit in a normal seat but I simply wouldn't fit (and I'm not that tall 194 cms). The friendly crew relocated me to the emergency exit row but what would I have done if the plane was full. Miss my flight? And why must I travel apart from my wife whom wasn't allowed to join me in the emergency exit row (which was mostly empty). At the airport when I inquired about booking the emergency exit row seats they tried to charge me €60! And that's per seat! Needless to say I'll never fly with this airline again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
My wife and I recently travelled with Vueling from Amsterdam to Barcelona and later from Barcelona to London. We found them to be efficient and at least equal to other low cost airlines such as Jetstar Australia. The flights were on time no baggage worries efficient (especially at the chaotic Barcelona terminal) and courteous. Criticism of the airline seems unfounded and we would fly with them again without hesitation.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
2 July Gatwick to Barcelona and return supposed be July Barcelona to Gatwick (this was cancelled) and we ended up travelling back on the Tuesday at 12.50 Barcelona to Gatwick. Very disappointing airline. Flight cancelled due to bad weather even though they advertise compensation nothing provided no food voucher hotel discount nothing. So beware you pay for what you get absolutely nothing! Even from Spain to UK people did not get a confirmed flight back next day. Flights booked by my partner but I won't be travelling with this airline ever again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
July 7 allegedly was a day of heavy weather - almost all Vueling flights from Barcelona were cancelled or late. Curiously no other airline seemed to be affected and all I observed was some rain in the morning and cloudy but otherwise fine weather in the afternoon. My flight (with 2 kids) back to Vienna was scheduled at 12.05 then postponed by an hour (without notice at the gate) then by another hour finally in the very second that people began boarding the plane it was cancelled and passengers were told to fetch their luggage (a wrong belt number was announced and displayed). The waiting line for rebooking stood at the Vueling desk all night through (I myself waited for 5 hours). I was offered the choice of having my booking changed to another Vueling flight to Vienna for which I would have to wait for 2 days or cancel and try another airline at my own cost. In the end we were booked on a flight to Zurich the next morning from where we took the train to Vienna. We had to spend the night in a seat at the airport. A hotel for the night was not offered for "weather conditions are outside the airline's control. I can only warn everybody to avoid this airline.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
On July 7 2014 my wife and I along with my two sons sister and brother-in-law were booked on flight VY8100 from Barcelona to Athens. The flight was scheduled to depart Barcelona at 10.20. We did not take off until about 15.30. Announcement to go to gate was made at about 12.05. We get to gate and are told that the plane was at the gate but because of the delay a fresh crew was to replace the original crew which had exceeded its permitted hours on duty and that it would be about 10 minutes. One hour later an announcement was made that a gate change was necessary. The original gate area was blocked off and US bound passengers were allowed to enter the original gate area for security reasons not as Vueling said operational reasons. After the change to the second gate the ground staff announced that boarding would begin in 15 minutes. We heard nothing more until we finally boarded at around 15.00. So besides the original ten minutes and second 15 minutes delay announcements we heard nothing no explanation no apology…nothing. We then board and while inflight the crew/captain had the audacity to charge for snacks/meals. No one had anything to eat while waiting to take off about 5 hours behind schedule. This delay caused us to miss the 16.30 and 19.30 ferries to Hydra from Pireaus. New ferry tickets had to be purchased for a total of 150 Euros.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I've flown a lot of budget airlines but I never thought it was possible for an airline to be this bad. Our first leg was Dusseldorf to Barcelona and I was staggered at how cramped the seats were but we got there on time. The next flight was unbelievable. We got to check in 35 mins before closing. Lines barely moved and as it got closer to closing they announced the last minute check in at a counter number that didn't exist. They announced the last minute checkout again for other flights but the queue was so long there (and almost impossible to get to in the crush) that we waited where we were. We did asked Vueling staff near the queues what we should do and they ignored us. When we got to an assistant about 1 minute too late they told us to go to the ticketing office as the flight had closed. At the ticketing office they told us they could put us on another flight to a nearby city for $600. I told them that this was unreasonable as their check in imploded and got nowhere. I asked to speak to a manager and was told they weren't going to be there for another 3 hours. When I was insisted they passed me on to the manager who was at the next desk. I still got nowhere and was offered a complaint form which would be answered within 3 months. When I asked for a pen to fill it in they wouldn't lend me one. Had to rebook. Will never fly with Vueling / Iberia / BA again.

Flew out 4/7/14. Flight out from Gatwick to Barcelona was an hour late with no explanation. 07/07/14 - Big storm at Barcelona which meant delays on other carriers but the Vueling flights were mainly cancelled. Our flight was showing as still going but delayed so we checked in a kept an eye on the information boards. When suddenly the flight disappeared from the board no announcement nothing on the board to say what had happen. We asked a member of staff (after finally finding one) and were told that our flight had been cancelled to go to the baggage collection pick up our bags and go back out and queue up at the Vueling desk to book another flight. The queue was very long at least 200 people in front of us and at least 400 behind us. We were offered a flight back home the following afternoon with no compensation for additional hotel or food costs. An absolutely terribly airline.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flight was cancelled from Malaga to Rome literally as we were lined up to board the flight. It was due to the French Air Strike but a little bit more notice would have be appreciated as other airlines had given 24 hours notice. Another flight the next day was offered but we lost our connecting flight from Rome.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Sunday June 15th 2014. Flight VY6004. We had same issue flying out of Florence to Barcelona as person going to England. People kicked off the plane because of 'weight' and 'high winds' We boarded on the tarmac didn't feel any wind. No luggage when arriving in Barcelona. It took 5 days to get the luggage. Again no help from Vueling. One person in their 'Baggage Tracking' center said after 2 days that no luggage was coming out of Florence. A complete breakdown of their system. No one could say why. So if you fly this airline don't check your bag carry on only. There is a reason they are inexpensive.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I had to book my family party of 5 onto their flight from Florence to London Gatwick on Sunday last week (29th June 2014) at 3.15pm. They advertise themselves as a low cost airline but the £1800 I spent on tickets for this single way fare seems to suggest otherwise. I tried to check in a week in advance to be organised and found that they only had single seats available nothing together. This was a problem for me as I have 8 and 6 year old children who would not have been happy sitting alone for the flight and even to book these tickets in advance I had to pay another £14 per seat and added this to the luggage which we needed which cost another £50 for just 3 sui cases. I called their customer service team to discuss this issue of which they said they could do nothing about it. I asked them how they could allow family groups to be separated and they told me that was the airlines policy I should have read the confirmation and terms before booking and I should try and ask people to move seats when I boarded - very helpful. On the day of travel we arrived at the airport early to try and resolve this issue and were offered - by the airport staff running check in not the airline staff - 3 seats together at the very back and 2 seats together at the front with no talk of compensation. A thoroughly unpleasant company providing a horrendous service with no thought for there customers never again!

My wife and I were booked on flight ODV22U out of Florence Italy to Gatwick London. The flight opened for check in at 12.30 with a departure time of 14.35. By 12.30 the entire flight was waiting to check-in and there were no lanes guiding the passengers it was a complete mess with people pushing in etc. To aggravate things even more there were only two check in clerks for this entire flight. We managed to get our luggage booked on by 14.00 with a sizeable queue still to go. Needless to say by the time we were due to leave passengers were still being booked in. Due to this inefficiency it lead to our flight losing it's take off position so we sat on the apron for an hour waiting our turn with not a peep out of the cockpit. No communication whatsoever a wonderful demonstration of good customer service. Eventually we left once we reached the necessary altitude the drinks trolley came out with two air hostesses servicing the entire plane. Sitting in row 23 we did not get any service because we had started the descend by the time these air hostesses got to row 19. A fellow traveller mentioned to us that every time she had used Vueling she had never arrived on time. Never again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
29 June 2014 flight from Barcelona to Malaga. We had checked in online and arrived in plenty of time to check in our luggage the lines for baggage drop off were very congested and moving very slowly and with 40 minutes to go it was obvious that we were not going make it. We spoke to a ground staff member as we were concerned about missing the flight and was told by her that we could use any line. After another 10 minutes we spoke to her again and was told then to go to last minute check-in counter 464. By this time the flight had been closed. We then went to the ticket office to arrange a transfer but were told that we had to buy another ticket and it would cost us 248 euro but if we paid cash it would cost us 211 euro. We were upset about this and left to consider our options. We did not know that Vueling had cheaper fares if you paid cash. The person at the ticket office was very indigent and unhelpful stating that the check-in counters open at 4.00am! When we returned to purchase the ticket which was the only way that we could get to Malaga we were told by another person at the check-in that the offer was no longer valid as we only had an hour to accept her offer the ticket. We could not believe the response because under no circumstances were we told this information by the previous check-in person and because we did not go back within the hour we had to pay a much higher fare. We asked to speak to the supervisor but were told that she did not want to speak to us.

We flew from Florence to Gatwick on the 16th June 2014. After waiting two hours we were told that 20 people would be bumped off the flight as there was some wind and they thought they wouldn't be able to get over the mountains otherwise! That didn't exactly inspire confidence. We found out from some other passengers that the exact same thing had happened the day before and they had been amongst the 20 people bumped off the plane. So after another hour we (the lucky ones) were boarded and arrived in Gatwick. After waiting for luggage we were told that Vueling had not brought anyone's luggage to Gatwick. Apparently they did the same the day before. I missed my onward connection and had to stay the night at Gatwick as did many others. I rang Vueling but was told there was no help to contribute towards either the stay in the hotel or the extra flight the following morning. I was without my luggage for five days and the person I was travelling with still hasn't received theirs. I rang Vueling every day and the staff were unhelpful and uncaring. They couldn't even tell me if our luggage had left Florence yesterday four days after the flight! Terrible service.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
My partner and I and another couple were traveling from Barcelona to Granada on May 29 2014. We looked for airline reservations in February and were a little dismayed by the Vueling airline reviews. Since Vueling was the only option we decided to book anyway. Our 2 friends - the other couple also tried to book 2 excellence fares - but only our sale for 2 Excellence fares went through (there are only 4 Excellence seats total) - and then the Excellence fare doubled in price - so our 2 other friends purchased optima fares. Our 5pm flight was on time - no problems checking in baggage - no extra charge although our friends each had a large suitcase. With the Excellence far we used the lounge with snacks and drinks and on board received complimentary food and drinks as well. The seating is arranged with 2 seats an aisle and 2 seats so the other 2 seats for the Excellence fare (at the bulkhead) were empty as double the cost was crazy! Our luggage arrived with the plane - all went smoothly! We would fly Vueling another time!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Returned from Florence to Gatwick yesterday. Flight delayed by 2 hours due to: Adverse weather conditions forcing switch to shorter runway resulting in 20 passengers being identified who had to move to next door boarding desk to be told they would not be flying that night as weight had to be reduced on plane to allow safe take off on the shorter runway. Luggage for those passengers had to be removed before we could fly and those selected included a split in couples and groups of friends leaving one husband flying but his wife not! We arrived in Gatwick and waited 2 hours in luggage reclaim before having to use passenger power to get information about our luggage. It was only then we were informed by ground staff (not Vueling) that our luggage was never onboard! It appears Vueling outsource luggage logistics to Swissport who have a reputation for being totally inefficient with Customers at Gatwick experiencing 4-5 hours delays in luggage reclaim. All in all an inefficient experience with appalling communication to their customers. I should also mention that on their on-board crew supplying beverages operated in a very slow inefficient way which I have never experienced with any other airline.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We flew with Vueling for the first time recently from Cardiff to Alicante. We were happy with our experience both ways. The flights left and arrived on time the planes were clean the crews were pleasant and the seats were a bit bigger than average (eg Thomson Thomas Cook Easyjet). We never purchase any food or drink on any flights - we always buy water at the airport and eat either before or after the flight so can't comment on the service or the prices. The only criticism I have is the speed at which the announcements are made both at the airport and on board. The people making them talk so fast that they don't finish one word before saying the next word.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flew from Florence to Gatwick. 30 minutes before boarding off they announced the flight would be diverted to Bologna because of adverse weather conditions. Looking outside the sun was shining with a gentle breeze on the trees by the runway. Cue almighty scrum to get on a coach. No organisation meant chaos. Arrived at Bologna and they were not expecting us! Finally got on the plane an hour later and sat on the tarmac for 90 minutes whilst they took some baggage off. I was at the back of the plane and they took nothing off! Got a small glass of water from the cabin crew before they sold extortionate food to hungry passengers. Landed five hours late. Seems this is a regular occurrence. Never again. At least Ryanair have learnt they cant treat passengers like this.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Vueling provided the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. After making my booking from Paris to Bilbao through a third party I received communication from Vueling that they had changed my flight to the day before I actually arrived in Europe. When I spoke with an agent my original booking was confirmed. I arrived in Paris only to be told that my original flight did not exist. My only recourse was to book a full fare ticket to my destination. To add insult to injury they will not deal with customer complaints by phone only online. But they don't actually respond to your complaints. I would never recommend this airline.

On time departure for a very short flight from San Sebastian to Barcelona. Clean aircraft and friendly onboard crew. However after parking at Barcelona it was a 15 minute wait for steps. Baggage wait 50 minutes- which was longer than the flight. Missed ground connection as a result. Flight good - but ground handling at BCN abysmal.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We had a very comfortable flight from Marseilles to Rome via Barcelona. The flight from MRS-BCN pulling into the same terminal we needed to be 90 minutes later to fly to Rome. That took away a great deal of stress trying to find our way around a foreign airport. The flights were good the staff excellent and should I ever have the opportunity to fly Vueling again I will jump at the chance.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I have never seen so many seats crammed into an A320. Basically there is no leg room - I'm over 180 cm and if it wasn't for the empty seat next to me I just don't know how I would make the flight. It was the most uncomfortable airline experience in my whole life. Also I understand that it's a cheap airline ("cheapskate" would be more fitting) but you have to pay even for the drinking water. All in all a horrible experience. Never again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
LIS-BCN return. Both flights departed with less than a 10minutes delay and arrived more or less on time. The leg LIS-BCN in a plane that have the magazine holder at the top so we have a reasonable leg room. The return flight on a plane with the old style of seating and less comfort. Both planes from the airbus 320-318 family. Flight personnel strict on security manners and very efficient on embarking the passengers I think that they managed to do the job in less than 20 minutes on both legs. A low cost company with no hidden extras who at that least don't make you pay for the boarding card if you don't manage to print it.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Never again. 4 flights in four days and all delayed. One 2 hour delay caused a further 5 hour delay due to a missed connection. Customer service dreadful. They charge callers 77p a minute and cut you off after 4 minutes asking you to call back. This happened repeatedly. Owned by Iberia - enough said?

### Vueling Airlines customer review
EDI-BCN-IBZ return. Outgoing flight was delayed by an hour which left less than an hour for my connection. They did not give me my onward ticket and had to check in again at BCN despite booking it as a single travel. They tried to take my hand luggage to the hold since there was no room for it on a half empty flight (be warned there are issues with bags and lack of space on every flight). I'd like to add that the customer who did have to place their luggage in the hold did not get it back for their entire trip. Extremely poor leg room. Very over priced snacks even for an airline. Complaints department do not respond. Do not fly with Vueling!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Complete mess. Plane took off almost one hour late from Barcelona without any reasons given. Pilot obviously did not try to recover lost time during the flight plane arrived an hour late which was really bad given the late hour - trains were all gone. Staff very unfriendly to passengers during boarding procedure. No apology whatsoever on arrival. No service people available to document delay. Phone hotline not reachable. Flight quality also bad. I fly a lot and seldom had I less room for my legs. Some airlines charge you for food on board Vueling even charges for drinks.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We have just returned from a short holiday to Florence. We flew LHR-FLR and returned FLT-LHR. (This route is switching to LGW on 31-03-14). Airbus A319. We booked the Optima fare as we knew we would not want to be restricted to cabin luggage and this also enabled us to select our seats towards the front of the aircraft when booking. Firstly I was impressed with the prompt embarkation of the flight at Heathrow. No last minute rush and no scrum! Secondly I am 6 ft and was very pleased with the amount of leg room. On our return flight we were in a different row but there was still adequate leg room. I actually tried comparing it to leg room in economy on Transatlantic flights we have taken and decided it was no less. The flight crew were friendly efficient and presentable. The flight deck also kept us fully informed particularly when we hit a nasty bit of turbulence over mountains. There was a glitch on our return flight but it was not the airline's fault. The luggage loading equipment failed and back up had to be called. This resulted in take off being about 30-40 minutes late. Once again we were kept informed of the situation. The Captain was visible and clearly doing all he could to get the issue resolved. To the airline's credit we landed at LHR only 5 minutes behind schedule so time must have been made up by the Captain. Overall then for a budget airline I was impressed and would not hesitate to book Vueling again if the schedule and prices were right.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We travelled Madrid-Barcelona at the beginning of March. Due to computer inability to check-in on-line (it seems I may not have been able to anyway as I am not an EU citizen) and some transportation issues we arrived 2 minutes after 'check-in' time. We did not have luggage to check-in. We were treated rather rudely. We were refused check-in. When I tried to re-book we were informed that we had to pay for another flight (at a significantly higher price). I may have mis-understood the airline info (but there is so much of it) and had understood that if we missed our flight we could re-book with a penalty fee. Apparently this only works if you check in. Well if one misses their flight they likely haven't had a chance to check-in. What is the point of all this check-in etc on domestic flights. I bought a ticket of course I want to use it. This isn't a cheap or efficient airline. My recommendation take the train!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Amsterdam-Malaga. Pretty new Airbus A320. Seat pitch extremely small - made 2 hours very uncomfortable. Luggage policy is forcing passengers to take as much as possible hand luggage - this is making boarding of the plane very chaotic as there is no sufficient space for all suitcases. Service on the board fair. Because of the small seat pitch I would not recommend using this airline.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I had a generally positive experience from FLR to LHR. The flight itself was comfortable the seat pitch not as bad as I feared as they put the magazine holder at the top above your knee level. The staff were friendly flight smooth airplane clean. Low-frills service with everything at cost even drinks. My only real complaint is if you book your flight via codeshare there is very little if anything you can to your booking on Vueling website. My flight was booked via BA with Iberia flight number operated by Vueling which prevented me from doing anything like seat requests. Also without an EU passport I could not do online check-in either which I had not experienced before.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flight 3000 - Barcelona (BCN) to Las Palmas (LPA) taken on Jan 31st 2014. In general we were more than satisfied with the flight itself which actually left the "gate" (a spot where the plane was parked on the tarmac) a few minutes ahead of schedule. On boarding the aircraft we proceeded to store out luggage in the overhead bin above our seats in row 3 only to be promptly told this bin was for "Excellence" guests (ie: those sitting in row 1 of the aircraft) and that we would have to move our carry on back to the next bin. Funny thing was no one sat in row 1 on this flight so the whole exercise was a bit stupid. The aircraft itself was in the Iberia livery as Vueling appears to be a subsidiary of Iberia. An older Airbus 319 it was obviously in need of a bit of tender loving care. The seats we were seated in sagged almost to the floor which provided for a rather uncomfortable four hour ride to say the least. Furthermore the aircraft had not been groomed prior to our boarding and as a result we found used tissues stuffed in with the flight safety card and magazines. Not a great start. The on-board service was no more than satisfactory to say the least and we will leave it at that. For our comments on the return flight from Las Palmas (LPA) to Barcelona (BCN) on February 16th you can refer to the separate entry.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flight 3001 - Las Palmas (LPA) to Barcelona (BCN) on Feb 16th 2014: Overhead bins directly above seats in rows 2 and 3 not available for those of us seated in these seats but reserved for guests seated in row 1 - regardless of whether or not there is anyone seated in that row. The very first overhead bin is obviously reserved for crew luggage which apparently takes precedence over paying passengers carry on luggage. Seats in 2a and 2c as well as in 3 f occupied by Vueling employees traveling from LPA back to BCN - along with the dog accompanying the two seated directly in front of us in row 2. Following take off all 3 of the above mentioned "passengers" disappeared behind the closed curtain into the forward galley area where they remained throughout the flight up to the landing announcement being made. The above mentioned dog did not remain under the seat where it should have been but had also disappeared into the forward galley area. There was absolutely no sign of a flight attendant following take- off from Las Palmas until nearly 2 hours into the flight. At this point we finally managed to get some service from the two young female attendants who were positioned at the rear of the aircraft who were not part of the "party" up front. There was no coffee tea or soft drinks being served to those of us in the forward portion of the cabin. Iberia was bad enough but this airline is even worse and we would not recommend them to anyone if they can at all avoid flying with Vueling. Our mistake was taking a chance on Iberia's subsidiary in order to give Iberia another chance. We now know we made a poor choice.

Flight on 2/2 Barcelona to Athens. Whilst everything was in order the flight itself was exceptionally rough lots of turbulence. Despite all this no announcement was made by the captain to calm certain passengers. This is normal in bad weather conditions the soothing voice of the captain likewise when approaching destination details are given on ground temp etc. On this flight nothing was mentioned we just landed and I must admit that the landing despite bad weather conditions was absolutely professional. In fact since take off until landing pilots failed to give us any single announcement. Last but not least they separated me from my partner at seat allocation.

BCN-PMI. Easy and fast check-in by using the kiosk. Flight departed 30 minutes late due to technical problems designated plane have to be replaced. Last minute gate change. Service and seats were good.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Check in was fast attendants seemed to be excellent. As you know you have to pay for a coffee. I booked this flight BCN-ATH 3 months ago and at check in no two seats next to each other were available hence my wife in row 18 and myself in row 26. This was the first time an airline separates passengers. I know I could have bought seats but I hate these airline tricks. On the positive side landing was excellent. This airline is not my choice only because of the above seat assignments.

VY1240 17/10/13 and returned VY1241 30/11/13. I have flown with Vueling three times in the past year. They are the best airline I have used from Cardiff to Spain and am thankful that they not only stepped in to fill the void after bmi baby pulled out but improved the standards at the same time. Please keep flying from Cardiff.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We traveled to Europe from the US in October 2013 and for a couple of our flights within Europe I decided to try Vueling with their lower prices and seemingly decent reputation. The first flight from Amsterdam to Barcelona was canceled and we never received notice that it was to be cancelled until arriving at the airport. Another flight was not available and they did absolutely nothing to provide any support or help. A long line of angry and displeased customers got the same "we can't help you" position after 45-60 minutes in line. Then we had already booked another flight with them from Barcelona to Naples a week later. I checked in advance and it was on schedule before we left to the airport. We arrived at the airport and sat waiting. The intercom announcement to go to the gate was heard by us and other passengers about 4 minutes before the departure time now maybe 30 minutes late. A long line of passengers stood in line until past the departure time only to learn from one of the passengers who called Vueling that the flight had been cancelled. They actually called the passengers to the gate and then left them there without telling them the flight was cancelled or anything nothing no word. This is one of the most ridiculous airline experiences I've ever had. Then the airline could not help us get out of Barcelona to Naples for another few days no offer of a refund or anything. One of the clerks for the airline even had the audacity to tell me that I shouldn't expect more as it is a discount airline. I will never fly this airline again.

FCO-ORY. Excellence Class - I purchased the ticket 2 hours before departure - Internet procedure was quick and efficient dedicated check in counter at FCO airport. The Business lounge is old style but there's everything you need from WiFi to catering. Excellence seats guarantee you an empty seat next to you for working dedicated carry on space so zero stress. Carpet old and worn out but no major problem. Staff very friendly asked me several times throughout the flight if I'd enjoy anything from the catering tray (for free since I was in Excellence). Plane landed 20 mins early - all this for 200 euros. Will definitely fly with them again.

BCN-DUS on 7 December. A320 direct flight was fine. Online check-in worked perfect and the bag drop took a minute from when I got to the counter. Seats are tight - and I always have knee-room in coach. Luckily the flight was 40% full so had a full row of 3 seats to myself. If the flight was packed or was longer than 2 hours it ould be pretty bad. Flight Attendants were great - super friendly. Bought a sandwich and drink and was decent tasting and quantity. Arrived on time and bags were out fast. I'd recommend Vueling for 2 hour flights or less - you get what you pay for and the flight was only Euro 60 including checked bag and assigned seat.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
My flight MUC to BCN made me realise how low-cost carriers should not be managed. I accept that no free drinks are served and I understand that space is very limited because as many passenger as possible need to be squeezed into the A320. It was somewhat unpleasant that staff was so rushed without time for friendliness. Really annoying however was the two hour delay on a Friday night due to the fact that the plane arrived late presumably due to the fact that the Vuelings schedule is too tight.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flew Venice to Barcelona - 29/11/2013. Flight was shambolic and a disgrace. The cabin smelt of stale body odour passengers were incorrectly seated and staff seem at best disinterested. Seats and leg room unacceptable and whilst being told hand luggage ok for flight was charged EUR35 when boarding despite bag fitting into weight and size indicator. Would never fly this airline again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Good service great attendants from Brussels to Barcelona. But legroom is terrible if you are taller than 180 cm then fly with another airline. 2 hours sitting bolt upright is not much fun.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I would caution you of flying Vueling (now merged with Iberia). They overbook by 20+% and they don't tell you this when you have purchased and confirmed your ticket. You need to obtain a seat at lease 3-4 days prior even the same day of booking try to obtain a seat. If not you are put on a standby list and typically have to fly on the next flight available. We are now in Seville Spain and our flight we had tickets for the 9.25am flight now we are on the 3.10pm flight because we couldn't get seats 24 hours prior online!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I am 5 ft 10 and have never been so uncomfortable on a flight before. There is no leg room and my legs were pushed into the seat in front of me. Also I have knee problems and am on crutches it is hard for me to stand. Long check in line. No one from Vueling even noticed that I was on crutches and offered to have me come to the front of the line as I stood in pain. Unfortunately I have another flight on Vueling from Barcelona to Tel Aviv on Monday November 11th. It will be my last flight with them.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I arrived at Edinburgh Airport on Wednesday for a flight to Barcelona only to be told by email that same day that my flight had been cancelled. I had to arrange at very short notice another flight. I think it was terrible for the cancellation to be at such short notice.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Booked flights from Stuttgart to Barcelona and back for me and my wife as the schedule was perfect for our trip the price was equivalent to LH or Germanwings. Check-in service in STR was quick and friendly (although they did not announce the delay of 35 mins as the incoming aircraft was late). The pain started when I tried to get into my seat I'm about 192cm and the legroom was so small that I could not find a comfortable position. Vuelings says they have a seat spacing of 31" but I I think it's something around 28" or they use old seats with thicker backrests so the space gets lost. Never had this problem on LH with the same 31". The flight crew on both flights was quite unfriendly the announcements in Spanish and English were not understandable a major issue for safety reasons. Ground service in BCN was bad waiting time for luggage was 50 minutes and the baggage check-in for the flight back took nearly an hour as Vueling had 13 open counters for app. 40 flights within two hours each with 150+ passengers even the last minute counter was overcrowded. Best thing was that they closed 4 counters in between for a break - unbelievable! Another major point in Vueling's cabin luggage checks nobody cares about size and weight of the luggage and the bins are already full when just the half of the passengers has boarded. So passengers need to stow their luggage into the non-existent legroom another security issue if an emergency evacuation might be needed. Conclusion: this was my first and last trip with Vueling you'll get much better service and professional handling for exactly the same price at other carriers with better ratings.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Travelled from SVQ to BIO. The flight schedule was on time the staff service was acceptable. The leg room on this aircraft however was ridiculous. I am not tall (5ft 9in) yet my knees were squeezed right up against the seat in front. I pity anyone 5ft 10in or taller on these flights. Clearly Vueling are trying to squeeze in more and more passengers on the flight - understandable but I have never been so uncomfortable on a flight. For the reason of leg room alone I will not choose to fly with Vueling again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Took a flight from Oslo to Barcelona to Menorca. I am 6'5" (196cm) and I could not fit into the seats at all (worst leg room I have ever experienced). No food or beverages or entertainment. Flight staff was nice and helpful. The biggest problem is that the Customer Service. My luggage was delayed for 2.5 days so I had to buy some new clothes and bathroom essentials. When I have enquired both by email and phone regarding this situation I receive no response at all. They do not even bother to answer my questions at all. I will never use Vueling again as they appear to have very little regard for their clients.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
After several pleasant flights with Vueling providing fair value I have now left them. The reason for this is their new luggage policy since last time: Be aware that Vueling now has a total luggage allowance of 23 kg per passenger. No not per suitcase per passenger. No matter how many cases you bring you'll have to pay for excess luggage if your total is more than 23 kg. As an example I was on the point of booking a flight from Prague to Alicante (which goes via Barcelona) when fortunately I discovered this in time. I was going to bring two cases at 20 kg each. This would have cost me 60 euros for the two cases plus 17 kilos of excess luggage at 12 euros per kilo giving a total of 264 euros! As many here will know Ryanair tried a similar scheme some years ago and abandoned it after massive customer dissatisfaction. It is very hard to understand exactly in which way Vueling feels it is a good business idea to repeat the mistakes of other airlines.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
BCN-LPA and LPA-BCN a week after. Seats very uncomfortable little leg room. Flight crew rude and not very accommodating. We have never experienced such an unfriendly crew. In general I believe that when someone decides to become a flight attendant there are 3 very important things they need to be. 1) Affable friendly accommodating. 2) Able to speak fluently in at least 2 languages. 3) Be able to orchestrate passengers through an emergency and succeed. Number 1 and 2 were failures for this airline.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
My husband is a professional saxophonist and we travel all over the US and abroad for his performances. He always carries his horn on board with him. He counts that as his carrying item and it stows just fine in the overhead compartment. Today we took a Vueling flight from Paris to Barcelona and we're told he couldn't bring it on board as a carry on and that he would have to either check it or purchase a seat for it and keep it on the seat. We had no choice other than buy the horn a ticket at premium rate (255 Euros) which was about twice what the combined cost of both of our tickets. We were furious particularly when we boarded and saw it was a typical Airbus 320 with loads if overhead storage. We will never fly with them again and will certainly check in the future whether other airlines are instilling similar policies.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We had a very good flight with Vueling from Menorca via Barcelona to Vienna. But the return we arrived at Vienna airport nearly 2 hours before take off to be directed to some remote terminal to check in as the online check in was not functioning. We queued for 40 mins only to be told by a terse official our cabin bags were going in the hold despite me protesting I needed medicines in my bag. I asked why we could not take them in the cabin as normal and she said the plane was too full. So we had a tense flight wondering if we would see our personal bags again! Flown millions of miles and never had this happen before. Problem I guess is Vueling had the seats so close together there were more seats than overhead locker spaces but this is cheating the public!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I booked this Barcelona - Dubrovnik flight several months ago from New Zealand. I too had read many terrible reviews and I was really worried about this leg of a once In a lifetime trip for my wife and me. Well I needn't have worried because the day was flawless and their online service leading up to the day was also exemplary. Barcelona Airport and Vueling check-in was smooth the boarding flight and luggage were spot on. Could not fault the airline. I'm tall so I paid a little extra for legroom. Brilliant.

I was very impressed with Vueling. The flight was Seville to Venice with stop over in Barcelona. All the flights left ahead of time and we arrived 20-25 minutes before Schedule.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
My husband and I booked flights online 3 months ago to travel from Barcelona to Venice. We checked in at the airport 2 hours early and were told to proceed to the gate and wait for our flight. We then lined up and as our tickets were scanned to board the flight we were advised that we were on standby and needed to wait at the side for 5 minutes until everyone had boarded. We had no idea what was going on as we had booked and paid for a full fare flight a long time ago. We were then advised that the flight had been overbooked and we did not have a seat! We were told to go to transit and had to wait 3 hrs for then next flight. We could not believe it! How does an airline book more people on a flight then they are able to accommodate! We were on a holiday and only had very limited time in Venice which had now been reduced by a further 3 hours due to an airline error. We also missed a Gondola Cruise that we had pre-booked online. Once we had finally spoken with the lady at the transit station she then told us that we could get on the next flight however could not sit with each other as the flight was once again full! I'm guessing this means that 2 other people on the next flight would have missed out on their seats also which is not fair on them either! I will not be booking with this company again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I flew in early August from Barcelona to London. I checked in online. Things at the airport seemed very disorganized. I queued up for 15 minutes in the baggage drop queue only to be told I had to check in via the London queue. When I said I had already checked in and showed the clerk the boarding pass she just shrugged her shoulders and told me to go into the other queue where I checked in again and was given new boarding passes. I spoke to other customers who had the same issue. There were no other Vueling staff available to ask. Not very impressed.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Bucharest - Barcelona - Aalborg. Both my flights were absolutely event-free and quite pleasant! We took off on time (a minor 10 min delay from Barcelona as they had to unload luggage for a couple of passengers that missed the flight). Both take-offs and landings were smooth. Food on board was fair-priced I ordered a menu with a sandwich 0.5l drink (coke) and a snack (Pringles) and it all cost 8.50 euro. For a low-cost airline I think the service and flight was very good. The only reason I'm not rating it as great is because they did nothing outstanding. The only inconvenience was the checked-in luggage policy: regardless of how many bags you bring the weight limit is for the sum of all your bags and it's only 23 kg. Unfortunately I found out about this after paying 34 euro for a second bag (for 2 flight segments) and did not get a refund after deciding to bring just one bag. So pay attention to this aspect! If your checked luggage exceeds the 23 kg allowed you'll pay 12 euro / kilo.

BCN-NZE-BCN. Our flight to Nice was cancelled at boarding time due to technical problems. Spent over an hour in the customer service queue (where the agents were argumentative and rude) to find out our options were: take a flight the next morning at 0800 which was full within minutes take a flight the next day at 1600 or take an 8-hour overnight bus to Nice. We took the horrid bus/coach (the only way we didn't have to pay more) and arrived at 0600 exhausted. The return flight was fine but one mediocre experience isn't enough to make me forget a terrible one.

A word of advice - if you want to go on holiday never go by Vueling! I tried to get to Barcelona today but I am still at home. After waiting from 2am to 8am in various queues at the airport we were told the flight was cancelled. This is not a reliable company and it's not cheap either! You pay but they don't provide any service.

ATH-BCN-TLS. Took the late 1.30am flight from Athens the Vueling lady at the counter was extremely helpful. The flight crew from Athens to Barcelona were polite and lovely! Spent 8 hours waiting for my transit flight in Barcelona yet even when there was a change in gates they made the announcement early enough for us to have plenty of time to find the new one. Both of my flights had zero delay seats were pretty comfortable. Yes there is not enough room to stretch but bearing in mind it's a low cost airline I think you get great value for money. Would definitely fly again with them.

SPU-BCN-IBZ. They cancelled the BCN-IBZ leg for no reason at the time of boarding with no explanation whatsoever. Could not find any representative to point me in the right direction or tell me what was going on. Luckily I thought to collect my bag from the carousel as they had originally told me it was checked all the way through to my final destination. No representative anywhere to advise on what to do found some Vueling airline staff they were rude and unhelpful did not want to talk to me. Finally got some help from another airline who advised I needed to line up at the ticket desk was there over an hour and instead of getting put on the next flight as was expected they bumped me on about 5 flights later meaning I wasted an entire day stuck in BCN airport. Funnily enough though they tried telling me all the flights were full I looked online and saw they were still selling full price tickets for the earlier flights. Just avoid the service is non existent and it's not worth it for the frequency of cancellations and losing precious holiday time being stuck waiting in airports!

Barcelona to Santiago de Compostela was cancelled 45 min before it was due to fly on 30 June 2013. At no time was there any sign of assistance from Vueling staff. Stood in line for over 60 mins after seeing our flight had been cancelled on the board only to be told to go to another desk where we again queued for 90 min only to again be told we were at the wrong desk. We protested loudly and only then were we given the paperwork to take to a hotel in Barcelona. We were woken at 3.30am to get on the 6am flight however on arrival to Santiago de Compostela our luggage was missing.

Our flight from Bilbao to Barcelona was delayed and then cancelled. We were standing around for hours not knowing what to do and hearing different stories eg no more flights to Barcelona that day etc. No one working for Vueling came up to us to tell us what to do so we had to split up and queue up for the Vueling information desk and also Vueling check in queue in case we could get another ticket. They are the cons but pros are that they were very accommodating for us all who were stranded and we stayed at a 4 star hotel in Bilbao that night followed by a new flight the next morning!

Cardiff to Malaga and back to Cardiff 11/7. For a budget airline - that's what it is no more no less! It was actually very good. Check in opens 2 hours before there is no point going earlier as you will just be waiting in a queue with the desk not open. Seat pitch is ok its a short enough flight and you can get comfortable enough. The seat does actually recline but the person behind may not thank you. Very pleasant crew - food and drinks to be bought reasonably priced. Both flights on time and AGP-CWL in only 2.10 hrs is brilliant. Nice bright cabin.

Flew from Barcelona to Alicante round trip. Everything was fine from Barcelona to Alicante however on the return flight I was told that my carry on bag was 10.5 kilos. The checked bag can only be 10 kilos. I was then told that the bag was to large and would not fit in the overhead binds. The bag fit fine on the first flight. When I purchased this carry on bag it said it was approved for cabin carry on. I was told that I would have to pay 35 Euros and have the bag checked. Very rude check in staff. Next time I will take a train and bus to Alicante.

Recently flew from Cardiff to Malaga with Vueling. I was a little apprehensive due to some of the reviews I have seen but I have to say it was a really good experience.

I would definitely recommend them and just wish they flew to more locations from my part of the country.

During check in on a flight from Madrid to Barcelona our carry on luggage was checked in without measurement or weight checks. The cost was 35 Euro per bag while our tickets showed the price to be 25 Euro. On purchasing the tickets all the "free" seats were taken and we were required to pay and additional 4 Euro per seat. Once on the Airbus 320-200 empty seats were available throughout the entire cabin. Why this airlines is rated anything other than 1 star is bewildering.

Paid to pre assign a seat upfront (3C) so I can get out first only to get on board and not be able to have my hand baggage above me due to the storage above rows 1 2 and 3 being reserved for their so called 'Excellence' 1st row seat passengers. The cabin crew insisted that I have to place in the nearest available space (over row 10) even though the space directly above me was empty! Ridiculous as it meant I had to either fight my way to row 10 once the seat belt sign came off after landing or wait until passengers disembarked then get my bag totally defeated the object!

How is it possible that you have to pay extra for getting a seat? If you choose to buy a ticket with no seat- reservation you still would expect to get a seat and to be able to fly with the flight you booked. But not at Vueling. The "free" seats were sold out so we had to pay for seats and getting on board on check-in even though we had a ticket! This is an outrage and not a serious airline.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flight was more than half an hour late with no explanation. The cabin crew were reading magazines for most of the flight and brought out the refreshment trolley just 20 minutes before landing. As a result only a quarter of the passengers got served the rest went two hours without refreshment of any kind. We complained and the stewardess appeared not to understand English. Flying Vueling was not an experience we want to repeat.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
CPH-FLR-CPH. April 2013. Vueling has recently (Dec 2012) introduced direct flights between Florence and Copenhagen. I had expected an Airbus 320 as they have a large fleet of that type however the aircraft used was an A319. The craft was fairly new with Recaro slim-line seats – very comfortable. Although the flights were very good: on time/early with very light loads a lot of Spanish was used for announcements despite not flying a Spanish route and some very irritating music played during takeoff and landing – however overall one of the best low cost airlines.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
VLC-AMS. Flight was on time staff were friendly and efficient cabin was bright clean well presented. The seat was better than expected with the pocket for magazines higher up behind the tray table giving a couple of cm extra legroom making it perfectly acceptable for a flight of a couple of hours. A comfort level comparable or better than Transavia and Easyjet. For the price paid an excellent flight and I would not hesitate to use them again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
LPA-BCN Feb 2013. Vueling operate most of the former Iberia domestic routes from Barcelona including Balearics and Canary Islands the fleet is all Airbus320's from Barcelona's (newer) Terminal 1 which is pleasant and well designed. The seat pitch on board is minimal and very cramped I would say even more so than Ryanair or EasyJet. Their 'Excellence' premium fare with seating in Row 1 is a complete waste of time and money because the leg room is even more restricted owing to the bulk-head at the front so you cannot stretch your legs anywhere. Cabin staff are usually young and well presented all are Catalan/Spanish and speak English but the poor legroom makes even a short flight uncomfortable (and I am average height) so I cannot recommend this airline.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I travelled economy BCN - Malaga - BCN with extra legroom as I knew the pitch was very narrow. Boarding was slow both ways and very disorganised on the way back. I had paid for extra legroom but it was taken away from me on the way back as they changed the aircraft. However the airline did refund the extra I paid for both ways. When you pay extra legroom you get what would be considered a normal pitch on other short- haul flights. Normal seats on Vueling have an extremely narrow pitch. I must say it was my worst trip on a plane in a while. The only positive point is that the cabin crew were friendly.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I flew from GRX to BCN on the night of 1 Mar 2013. It wasn't a full flight hence boarding was a breeze. Cabin crew were friendly and the aircraft was really clean and I felt that the legroom was not as limited as other Asian carriers operating A320 that I've been on. Flight departed on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Based on my experience flying on budget carriers in Asia Vueling certainly exceeded my expectation!

NCE-BCN BCN-SVQ SVQ-NCE via BCN. While in Barcelona I receive an email telling me that my flight from Sevilla to Nice has changed but with no information on the nature of the change. In BCN on my way to SVQ I asked the Vueling information desk and they couldn't access my return flight information. In Sevilla I called again until I was told the flight I had booked had been cancelled. I had to stay an extra night in Sevilla at my expense so I could fly back one day later as scheduled. I paid 12 € per leg for carrying my luggage in the hold however I noticed several passengers with large and heavy bags in the cabin. This makes you wonder about the policy. Like many low-cost airlines Vueling has leather seats and I don't like the feeling of sliding down on them. Although I would not recommend flying with Vueling they are very competitive in terms of fare and often the only choice on certain routes.

Rome - Nantes. Flight cancelled and the only option given to us at the desk was to fly later on to Paris with a coach journey on to Nantes. Supposed to arrive at 7pm and ended up arriving at nearly 4 in the morning the next day. We were travelling with our 2 year old. Staff unhelpful. No refreshments no help at all. Pretty annoyed to see in the EU legislation that they are obliged to offer us a similar flight at a later date - at the desk they told us if we didn't accept the coach journey it'd be at our own cost.

LHR-BIO. Maybe I've done BIO with Easyjet too often but it all seemed to go very smoothly. 1/2 full plane helped so could spread out. Flight on time service was fine. 9.50 Euros for baguette beer and Pringles would be excessive on the ground but OK as budget airline costs go. Check-in took 5 minutes boarding was quick.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Barcelona to Ibiza return. Fine for a short flight. Clean plane and comfortable seats although leg room limited - managed to book an exit row seat on return which helped. Boarding chaotic and passengers carried more than the 10kg hand luggage which wasn't controlled and led to storage issues. Both flights arrived early. A good budget airline experience overall.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flying Vueling is more or less a disaster. I flew them 8 times in the last 3 weeks (mostly ZRH-BCN-LPA) and no flight was on time. I always purchase the tickets online and did not receive a confirmation 3 times in the last few weeks so I had to go to the ticket counter at the airport. Yesterday (BCN-LPA) we had a delay of 79 minutes without any explanation as to why with no apology. Service is often quite unfriendly very shocking indeed that cabin crew are often unable to speak English fluently. Vueling flies with AB A320 - not very comfortable but at least quite new.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
The one negative experience was that they changed boarding gates and we did not realised it until we saw no activity at the gate very close to boarding time. But that could also be because we were in a foreign country and could not hear or understand the announcements properly. Recently I travelled a lot and the one thing I really appreciated was the pilot who indicated landmarks something that did not happen on any of the other flights I undertook. Barcelona to Brussels 11.11.2012. The food and beverages were very average but in par with other airlines.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
BCN to CPH. Online check-in did not work but no speakable line at El Prat and seats allocated as desired. Called early to the aircraft so we left on time. Arrival 20 minutes early into CPH. Not bad for a budget airline.

Barcelona to Venice with my wife even though it was an early flight it turned out to be very good and on time. Crew very helpful and polite.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Although the seats were a bit too close together for my comfort I found the staff at the gate and onboard very efficient and professional. Our flights between Barcelona and Palma were on time.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Avoid or ravel at your peril with Vueling. An 18 hour delay on a 2 hour Barcelona to Southampton flight. Ended up on a rescue plane that had to be chartered from the UK which diverted to a different airport at the last minute and arrived at Southampton on coaches at 3am. Barcelona Airport was carnage all day as Vueling cancelled one flight after the other and customer service agents are only landside meaning a lot of to-ing and fro-ing. It says something when an airline needs to have a police presence at a departure gate.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We booked four flights this year for CWL to BCN and return. Vueling managed to cancel one with three days notice and alter the other three. One flight they altered left us at BCN at 0130 on a Monday morning. Another they altered from Saturday to Sunday. To make matters worse we tried to rebook to different days and they wanted another 156 Euros. No reply to e-mails so eventually rang them on their Premium Rate phone line which cost £10. It cost an extra £400 to use this airline for our holidays this year in rebooked flights and additional accommodation and all without the slightest apology. I would have been cheaper to fly Club Class with BA. Use this airline at your peril. They are cavalier about their schedules and don't give a damn about their customers.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Our flight from Barcelona to Southampton was cancelled and we haven't been notified. We found it out at check in. Redirected to their main office who admitted that they have no flight scheduled to Southampton and that we had to go and purchase tickets with another airline. Spent £600 to fly to Heathrow + trains to Southampton!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
DME-BCN-PMI and back which turned to be PMI-BCN-OLY. On the route from Moscow to Palma-de-Mallorca via Barcelona: the planes were new the crew were great the seats comfortable and the timetable convenient. The problems began on my way back. The plane from Palma to Barcelona was delayed for an hour so at the time of landing in Barcelona my connecting flight to Moscow was supposed to depart. Instead of delaying the flight to Moscow for 30 min which would have been sufficient for us to board Vueling opted to send a plane to DME without us. What was even more infuriating is that Vueling representatives assured me that the flight was waiting for us at D10 gate. The transit desk managers could offer nothing better than the next flight at the same time tomorrow! Such situation was unacceptable for me so they gave me a boarding pass to Paris-Orly flight in the early morning. The flight to Orly was not good - the plane was extremely old and dirty. What I can say is that Vueling is not so cheap but has very convenient schedules from Moscow to Barcelona and back. To sum up could be an option if you are flying without baggage and with at least a 3-hour connection. Otherwise stress is guaranteed.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Return flight Heathrow to Vigo was one of the most enjoyable and hassle free economy journeys. We were allowed to add a bag last minute with no penalties; staff were superb tiny overweight in our bags was ignored. The plane clean and comfortable the online communications regular and the schedule spot-on. The website could improve but that is not to take away from the overall experience - beats Ryanair and Easyjet.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
AMS-BCN return. BCN-IBZ return. We tried this new airline because of the timetable and cost. Unfortunately at every turn we were disappointed. Three of four flights were >45min delayed for no reason (no reason given no apology felt necessary on behalf of crew). We realized upon booking that it was 100 euro cheaper to buy one-way tickets versus return tickets for each destination. However what we did not realize nor is it mentioned that your luggage will not connect. In other words you must pay 100 euro more each-way for your luggage to connect. We had 35 min to connect in BCN claim bags check-in get on plane (we made it). Very misleading and even the check-in agents said it was a very bad business policy and to write to the company. The seating provides very little legroom. The flight crew were superb - that's about the only high mark.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Travelled between Stockholm and Barcelona in July. No problems at all on schedule friendly staff and they actually let people pass with too much luggage. However if your height reaches above 5'11-6feet (1.80m) the space for your legs will not be satisfying.

MAD-BCN-Mykonos return. All flights on time arrival early in most cases. Service good for a low cost you have to pay for food. FA very nice. Connections in BCN are very easy. Totally recommended.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flew Vueling twice this summer from Cardiff to Palma. All flights on time brand new aircraft all staff cheerful and courteous. Slight problem flying out on 19/08/12 plane very warm and ice and limited cool drinks no trolley service. Staff struggled to serve everyone but I was one of the lucky ones. No online check-in available for some reason? No problem though at Palma there were four desks open whilst the one Iberia desk had a long queue. Only downside was having to make a name change to one of the bookings after reading the exceedingly small T and C print a €39 fare e/w became €115 e/w and effectively we had to pay twice for the same seat.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flight from Prague to Barcelona was on time taking off and lending without any problems or discomfort nice staff and good organization before boarding. Comfort of the seats as usually as with other low cost airlines. Reasonable for money we paid.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Having experienced a 6 hour delay before leaving Malaga for Barcelona at 4 o clock in the morning we now find that our connecting flight to Southampton has been delayed for at least 2 and a half hours. No explanations no information no staff in sight - nothing! As a compensation for the 6 hour delay we are offered a €20 voucher to set off against our "next flight". I implore everyone never to use this airline. It boasts of having moved up to the first division of airlines; first division of lack of service.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Arlanda - Barcelona. First announcement for a delay of 1 hr then 2 then due to technical failure a new aircraft would arrive from Hungary! That one also delayed. Due to delay we did not get the extra space we had paid for due to overbooking. We arrived at final destination with 8 hour delay. No customer email to complain and no one to talk to. First and last time with Vueling!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Rome to Menorca on the 21st of August and returned on the 26th via Barcellona. Check-in online was not working at all so we had to stand on a very long line for 45 minutes on the outbound. I paid extra money to have front seats yes but you cannot put the suitcase in the overhead compartment because the Demo Kits are stored there. On the way back we went 3 times to Mahon in order to get the boarding passes before the departure day as we knew it would be crowded: the first it was too soon next they gave us the Menorca/BCN boarding at 12.00 but asked us to go back to get the BCN/Rome boarding pass later. BCN/Rome also had +3 hrs delay!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I flew from BCN to SVQ. Flight would have been on time hadn't there been an absolute chaos on board. Flight attendants were very friendly but had to cope with rude passengers who simply don't understand what one piece of hand luggage means. Flight was full and so where the overhead bins within 10 minutes. Passengers came with 3 bags and were yelling at the flight attendant that they had payid for the ticket and that it is the airlines problem to have enough space for their stuff. After 30 minutes discussing with the passengers they told them that either they calm down and give the luggage to be stowed in the belly of the aircraft or they would call security and they would stay on ground. This worked and these passengers finally sat down and were quiet the rest of the journey. Flight was smooth but my knees where hurting as I was squeezed to the seat in front of me. just not enough legroom. If there was an alternative from Barcelona I would choose it.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Rome to Barcelona. Booked it via Iberia website. Fare is the same as if you book on Vueling website but the difference is you do not pay baggage charges if book as an Iberia flight so this should serve as a tip for everyone. Flight was smooth. Aircraft was old but comfortable. Flight attendants were all smiling and seems eager to help. Nothing particularly outstanding about this airline but would fly them again due to fare being reasonable.

Only use them because they fly Cardiff to Alicante and for this reason would use them again. Very basic. Food/drink pricey. Staff were pleasant but English fluency scored low particularly the onboard announcements - a point exacerbated by loud interference on the intercom.

Southampton to BCN and return. Out on 9th Aug and return on 18th Aug. Excellent flight both ways on time and good check in. One problem on return was slow refreshment service appeared one person served the other took cash thus took ages to serve all children had to leave some drink as we were on approach we were not served until we had throttled back over the channel. Staff were very friendly. Should they fly from Southampton to BCN will use them again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flew Cardiff to Barcelona on 10th August. Flight on time staff on board friendly and efficient. Airbus A320 clean modern aircraft and extra legroom seats comfortable. Only downside no online check in from Cardiff yet. Return journey from Barcelona pleasantly surprised to see Vueling open a block of check in desks for all flights and therefore able to check in within 15 minutes of arrival. Return flight slight delay but again newish A320 aircraft and great service from cabin crew. Will definitely use again. They are a budget airline with allocated seating making the experience more relaxed than some other budget airlines.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Horrible Customer Service at Paris Orly. More than 3 hours of delay ok this can happen from time to time. Then we asked to customer service for information they had no idea. Ok this might happen. They stated they have no information whatsoever on the new flying time. Then information on the panels showed "flight on time" then boarding in a door that was not the right one then boarding on another door everyone moving again but no plane. Then Vueling customer service left no one in the counter. Then new announcements for immediate boarding then in that door there is the boarding for another Vueling flight not ours Chaos. We tell the Vueling personnel at the boarding gate and she nicely tells us "are you able to read? This door is not for your flight ! What a nice service from this lady. We arrived to Barcelona next day (were supposed to arrived at 9pm) really annoyed with those people that work as " customer service " for Vueling. Only one nice word to a lady kind of supervisor that took finally care of the situation. Information at the end was provided (bad news on hour departure but at least trustable news) complaint forms were made available a sandwich and a refreshment offered. Vueling Customer Service personnel at Paris Orly is a real low cost service and some of the persons there are really not able to deal with customers and act with minimum empathy and competence.

Instead of enjoying the first night in Marbella we got stuck in Vienna. After Boarding the announcement came that due to technical Problems we had to disembark the aircraft initially they told us to return after 2 hours later the flight was cancelled. After chaotic discussions / announcements / luggage collection they booked 80 rooms for a full aircraft (A320). So now we are in the hotel not knowing what is next.

SOU–BCN–IBZ–BCN–SOU. I read the other reviews on Vueling before setting off I was slightly hesitant when we all arrived at Southampton (3 flights from SOU-BCN during the summer months) for our flights to IBZ. I shouldn't have been worried all 4 flights were great. The aircraft's were clean and tidy grey leather seats and colourful headrest covers. The crew were very friendly and polite they moved one of our party who was over 6ft to an emergency exit seat on 3 out of the 4 flights service you don't get on other full service carriers. You do have to pay for drinks and snacks which is common on any low cost carrier. Although Vueling isn't a well known airline in the UK I would certainly book them again without question. Oh and all our check- in luggage arrived which was great!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Absolutely appalled by Vueling. Flying from Paris to Barcelona Sunday night and we arrived the requisite "40 minutes before or else" to check in but their representative decided we were 10 minutes late (meanwhile there was no security line -- plenty of time to make the flight!). Then they made us purchase another ticket for 120€ (the first representative wouldn't couldn't or simply didn't want to help us out and we had to wait in line for another Vueling desk). The next Vueling representative agreed that indeed your extortion policy was ridiculous. With seemingly no other options we attempted to purchase a new ticket with the Iberia miles - but their human representatives (both Vueling and Iberia) wouldn't process this request and instructed us to either call the company directly or go online. Silly and incredibly inefficient. I am extremely disappointed by Vueling (and Iberia) and cannot recommend this airline. How can anyone have confidence in Vueling if they don't seem to respect their own customers?

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Menorca to Madrid via Barcelona on a flight booked only last week due to Air Europa cancelling the morning flight on a similar routing. Fare was expensive for what is was after adding seat reservation baggage fee (charged separately for both legs) and a connection fee (a first). On time boarding on both legs both flights full including off duty staff using jump seats. Very cramped with little leg room. A record for the fastest and most unintelligible safety briefing in Spanish and English. A service selling food and drink was slow and short with the curtain pulled across for most of the flight. On time arrivals on both legs which is about the only positive note.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
TXL-BCN-SVQ return 4 flights. Outbound it was not possible to check in online. All flights left late but made up the time so no problem with connecting flights. planes were not cleaned properly extremely little legroom and I am not a tall person - you have to pay extra for a bit more space (1st row). Very friendly cabin crews.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
BCN-TXL. As you can read in the previous two reports Vueling now apparently consistently denies boarding for no reasons. I have flown regularly for 2 decades and this has never happened to me. While there is always a first time I was sincerely shocked by ground staff who offered no excuse no assistance and only a re-booking for next day for 119 Euros.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Couldn't print a boarding pass from the website. Was running on a tight schedule and got there one minute after their cut off time of 45 minutes and they gave me a choice of either losing the 106 Euro (6 Euro was for using a Visa debit card!) or buying a ticket on the next flight for 110 Euro. The plane was old as well and they left 15 minutes late. The only positive thing is that the flight attendants were nice.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Paris to Barcelona return. Outbound flight 2.5 hours late. For the return segment we arrived at the airport 1.5 hours prior to the flight and were told we were on stand by because the flight was oversold. They did not apologize or try to accommodate us or explain the alternatives - merely told us we had to wait and it is their right to overbook. Customer service dismissed me. With a lot of drama we managed to get onboard. This is a cheap airline and you get what you pay for. There is no service onboard or on the ground. I consistently fly over 150000 miles a year and the last time I was denied boarding due to overbooking was in 1994!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Vueling is a budget airline but it couldn't be further from the Ryanair experience. Seats recline and have music for a start. They allocate you seats so you don't have that horrible rush to get on the plane. Staff are friendly and courteous and they aren't militant about hand-baggage. Their inflight magazine is readable. The reason I'm giving Vueling a 10 out of 10 is because yesterday they changed our flights for us within minutes and at no extra cost no fuss whatsoever despite the fact that we were at fault not Vueling. That sort of service is priceless!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Flew from Paris ORY to LIS in early April. Seat space is very tiny. At nearly 2m tall I could barely fit in the seat. The plane was 2/3 full so could stretch my legs because the row behind me was empty. If this was a 3+ hour flight and packed I would find it tough to cope due to no leg room. Otherwise the plane was new staff very courteous and the price was a steal. If you are normal height I would warmly recommend these guys.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
We were booked and confirmed on a 11am flight from Madrid to Barcelona. Arrived from our overnight flight to find that the 11am flight was cancelled due to a transportation strike. When the bored and disinterested person at Vueling's gate found out we had booked with a booking service they refused to help us find other transportation later flights or even directions into Madrid. We sat down within view of the gate calling around looking for options. Many people went to the gate and all were turned away - the few employees left well before 11.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
AMS-ALC-AMS. My 5th flight on this route always good service with friendly staff. I normally pay extra to reserve a seat near the front. Staff onboard are usually very nice and accommodating. Seat pitch is not great but it is a LCC. Seats are comfortable enough though for short haul and the planes are clean newish A320's. Generally on time.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Vueling has sunk to new lows which I didn't think was possible after the appalling service over recent years. My husband was one week post knee surgery and although ground staff were very helpful and had moved us to seats with extra leg room on board it was a completely different matter. Staff were nothing short of rude and insisted we move back to our original seats - leaving the row where we had been due to sit completely empty. Came out with all sorts of illogical inconsistent excuses - cannot help but feel it was because the front seats attract an increased fare and they don't want to give them up for nothing. Vueling make Ryanair look like a premium airline.

CWL-BCN-CWL. Or it would have been if they hadn't cancelled the outward flight 3 days before departure. Website and communication appalling. There is no UK contact number only a Spanish Premium Rate one and emails are in Spanish . Did get the return flight which was just about ok. Plane was old legroom was poor compared to easyjet. Luckily we were able to get an outward flight with easyjet from BRS but naturally at a greater cost.

FLR-BCN. Our flight was cancelled the night before Easter there was no representative in the airport so were told we were "on our own" regarding transportation back to the city centre and a hotel. Finding a hotel proved to be difficult and expensive getting help from Vueling has proved to be impossible so far. I was stuck in Florence for 2 extra days and my husband for 3 until the airport was able to reschedule the flights. Needless to say an unhappy ending to our anniversary travels.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Our flight from Madrid to Paris was ok but the return a nightmare. No plane due to mechanical problems in Madrid. Departed the next day after 15 hours of sitting. 5 euro voucher given for food but excluding drinks. They refused to permit any transfer to another airline during the miserable wait. No Vueling agent there to keep us informed. No offer to put us up in a hotel overnight. Arrived 5am and no public transport running to Madrid. Lost our prepaid reserved train to Cordoba.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Very expensive ticket (€255 return PRG-BCN) compared to other low-cost airlines with same service (buy onboard policies). Staff delivered a professional service but did not guarantee the passengers comfort due to no interference with a very loud group of passengers and no speeding up during boarding. Standard low-cost seat space but they could be reclined.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
BCN-DME. While check-in at BCN was okay the crew onboard was utterly incompetent. I have flown in and out of Russia countless times and with the exception of Vueling every airline has provided non-Russians with a landing card. Instead I had to remind them. They had no idea what I was talking about at first and insisted that I didn't need such a thing. No refreshments and crew didn't tell passengers to quieten down as it was an overnight flight.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
LHR-La Coruna-LHR. Great to be able to use a low cost airline from Heathrow and generally impressive. Friendly service nice clean and modern A320 and on time both ways. Only downsides - annoying Muzak and more annoyingly the worst legroom I've seen on any plane. Fortunately loads of empty space to spread out on outward journey and had exit row seats (which are rows and 14) on return.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
TXL-MAD-TXL booked last minute and got a cheap fare. Planes appeared to be clean with the exception of the carpets which were very dirty. Also noticed many broken parts of the cabin interior handles of baggage compartments were fixed with tape and a sharp metal piece stuck out of the tray table. The seats were leather and comfortable but legroom was tight. Flights were not full we could spread out and they were on time. The cabin crew were quite nice but going through the routine. Would consider again if price is right.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
ORY-BCN return. Good value for money even though I booked shortly before departure. ORY airport much more convenient than CDG. Both flights on-time young and friendly cabin crew with good command of English. However major downside is the incredibly cramped seating - I have never experienced such a tight legroom. Vueling website slow and affected by many technical glitches.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Cramped seats very narrow and it is seemingly the idea of this airline to crowd as many people on the aircraft as possible. Anything to eat or drink including water there was a charge for. Thank goodness the flights were 2 hours or less.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
After some flights the main problems I found flying with Vueling are seats are extremely uncomfortable with not enough leg room for someone of normal size. Not enough space between seats for opening laptop or working at all; and hardly for reading. Cabin temperature too high in all flights. I found many other people also complaining about this unsuccessfully. Ambient music is always annoying specially when loud and before 8-9 in the morning and after 21-2200 hrs in the evening. It is a low cost airline however prices are much higher than Ryanair or Easyjet for the same service.

Athens - Barcelona - Alicante I had my flight booked for 5th October which was a day of strikes in Greece. On 4th October at mid day all other airlines had cancelled their Greek flights for the 5th but Vueling customer service insisted that there was no strike in Greece the following day. Later in the afternoon I received a text message to say that my flight for the following day had been cancelled. Rebooked the Athens Barcelona leg for the 6th October with no difficulty and no cost. Was told I could rebook the Barcelona Alicante leg for a cost of 115 euros. I checked on line and bought a new ticket for 109 euros! Flights fine; we left Athens late because the airport was in chaos and the other leg was on time. Twice I have experienced that "you will never lose your money with Vueling" as on their website and twice I have lost my ticket and had to buy a new one.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Athens-Barcelona return. Outbound flight very full. No option of online check-in - came to the airport early despite travelling with no luggage only to find the check-in counter closed. When it opened some 1 hour later an epic queue had formed but departure was on time. In Barcelona security check with the 'mobile phone boarding pass' went smoothly. Return flight delayed 1 hr about 60% full and much more comfortable even considering the extra-cramped legroom. The planes on both journeys were rather new but already looked a bit worn with pieces of plastic missing here and there. The crew apparently speak English but in this case the onboard announcements were incomprehensible. They keep communication with non-Spanish-speaking passengers to a minimum and are considerably less friendly than any flight attendants I've encountered even on low cost/charter flights. Even though it should be in their best interest to sell refreshments they do not offer them when they pass with the cart - you have to ask yourself and loudly. Overall a mediocre flying experience definitely overpriced for what is being offered.

LHR-SVQ-LHR. I paid a little more for extra leg room. I use them several times a year and have never had a problem odd delays more often than not running early. What do people expect for these prices. I also use their PUNTO or airmiles programme and have twice flown at no cost to myself.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
BCN-DME. This night flight was 1.5 hrs late the crew didn't even apologize for the delay. My extra-paid XL seat by emergency exit was uncomfortable - one of the armrests was missing due to security requirements but there wasn't even a pillow onboard to use instead back recline was close to nothing. Paid snacks and drinks. When passengers were leaving the plane the crew stood with their backs to them chatting between each other didn't care to say goodbye.

My wife (Bosnian biometric passport) and I (US passport) were not issued boarding passes on or scheduled flight from Madrid to Paris CDG. Check-in staff at Barajas Airport wrongly stated my wife needed a visa to enter Spain or France. We informed the supervisor he was wrong and he checked with his superiors who said we could not be issued boarding passes. We missed our flight but the police determined we were indeed authorized to fly. The check-in supervisor never acknowledged his error or apologized. At Barcelona the check-in girl saw immediately that we were right Madrid staff never bothered to read past the first line of text on the screen. A few poor members of staff and a lack of customer skills destroys what would otherwise be a great airline bargain.

I flew ORY-BCN. My flight from Paris was on time 1 hr late on my return but such things happen to all airlines. Check in is fast and easy staff friendly and overall helpful especially at Barcelona airport. Before I bought tickets I read the previous comments in which most people complained about the legroom - didn't have such problems it is less spacious yet comfortable enough and with a small fare you can choose seats with more legroom. Flight attendants professional and polite food and drinks of a reasonable price. I'll definitely use their services in the future.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I have flown Vueling on several occasions for business from LHR-BIO and couldn't fault anything. On my last flight from BIO-PMI I was amazed to see two civilians being invited into the cockpit for take off during the taxiing. They returned to the cabin once we were airborne but were invited back on the descent into Palma for the landing. I emailed Vueling asking about this but got a non sensical answer. Less impressive was the lack of response from the Spanish authorities asking them what they thought of it.

BCN-JMK. Excellent flights both ways. The flight out was less than half full and very comfortable. The plane was clean and the staff friendly. Just please change those croissants! They are inedible. Flight full on the way back. On time both ways. After a number of recent flights with other low cost carriers flying with Vueling was a pleasure.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Vueling from Heathrow-La Coruna. The plane was brand new. Sandwich and snack menu (to buy) pretty good for an airline. Check in and departure smooth and punctual landing a little early in both locations. Seats were comfortable only complaint the lack of legroom. Booked Vueling flights through Iberia's website. This is an all- inclusive price compared to the extras which are added on at vueling.com.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Been using Vueling regularly for Business out of Paris Orly and CDG to Rome and Seville - this over 4 yrs or so. Must be my 15th or 20th return flight yesterday. I have never been late - there are often ATC delays but the planes are always ready for departure on time. The crew members are always pleasant. I pay a few Euros extra for leg room in the emergency-exit located seats. For a low-cost airline they are better than their competitors.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Amsterdam-Barcelona-Ibiza-Amsterdam. Amsterdam-Barcelona uncomfortable seats very cramped. Cabin crew barely speak any English this was confusing during Flight Safety. Barcelona - Ibiza more uncomfortable seats. Crew did not speak any English only Spanish. Ibiza-Amsterdam cabin crew rude to passengers. Again they only spoke Spanish. We have had bad experiences with Vueling. Although the are a low cost airline we paid EUR 745 because our trip was an emergency. When I can choose from more airlines for this kind of money I will not choose Vueling again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
I recently booked to fly with Vueling from Palma Mallorca to Athens. I was emailed about a fortnight before the flight with an email telling me there was a change of schedule - I glanced at this assumed it was just a slight time change and carried on. When I arrived at the airport it turned out that it wasn't a "change of schedule" - they had cancelled the flight and booked us on to one the following day - much too late for me to make my friend's wedding. I was so upset and angry - surely the very least they should have done was to email with capital letters in bold type saying that our flight had been cancelled and offering to put us on another flight? Absolutely appalling customer service and communication.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Barcelona to Amsterdam early morning flight. Seat pitch it is ok if you are under 6 foot friendly crew. English announcements professional and the buy on board drink prices no more expensive than the airport. You need to pay for luggage and selecting a seat but the website was easy to use and baggage drop quick.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Madrid to Barcelona return. The first thing is that the seats are too small - I am over 2 meters tall but there is cramped and there is Vueling Cramped. I'm an expert in folding myself into economy seats but these are the smallest seats I've ever had the displeasure of flying in. My other major complaint is that they do not enforce their policies uniformly. My bag was oversized and while in Madrid they let me check it into the plane the desk attendant in Barcelona charged me the €22 fee that is the rule.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Barcelona to Seville awful seat pitch. Service and attention onboard was okay. The check-in agent was attentive and made no fuss of the fact that I didn't have my passport or Spanish ID card and accepted as proof of identity a UK photo Drivers Licence debit card used for website purchase. The fuss came at the gate where two agents were reluctant to let me board claiming I needed (as a foreigner resident in Spain) my passport. I said at check-in their colleague said my personal documents were OK for a domestic flight. They stated he had made a mistake and should not have allowed me to check-in. A good scare but managed to "buy my way on board". Sent an e-mail a week ago to VY asking for clarification on this matter but have had no reply thus far.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
What legroom. Should be illegal to have such cramped conditions. What made it worse was that it was booked via Iberia via BA and couldn't access the online check in to upgrade to seats with extra legroom. Rubbish travel and support from all airlines involved.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
CDG-ALC. Vueling offers good value for money even though I booked three days before departure. Flight delayed by 1hr30min due to technical problem - many apologies from the friendly crew but English hardly understandable. Food and drinks for purchase - reasonable prices average coffee. A320 modern and spotlessly clean. However major downside is the incredibly cramped seating - I have never experienced such a tight legroom.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
LHR-SVQ-LHR good fare of 164 euros return booked two days before liked the ability to choose seats online with seat chart chose seats out and back at a nominal fee printed off boarding cards for both flights - an advantage travelling from LHR terminal 3. A320sformer Iberia aircraft clean good condition seat pitch tight with 180 seats and it wasn't too uncomfortable for 2.5 hours. Good Spanish/English safety demo. The cabin crew interacted well smiling and engaging with customers. Inflight snack menu at low cost prices eg sandwich and a beer for 7.5 euros 2.5 euros for a soft drink. The service took a while on both flights to appear about 30 mins but a good selection of drinks and snacks available and well presented. All announcements in Spanish and English which cabin and flight crew spoke well.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Several flights during the last months between Paris Orly and Valencia. Quick check in at both airports. Less strict than other airlines with carry on luggage policy (no checks at check-in or boarding). All flights on time or in advance. Modern A320 with cramped legroom but reclining seats. Nice lounge music played during boarding and landing. Good magazine. You have to pay for food and drinks. Young friendly and well groomed cabin crew. More expensive than Ryanair but better service and luggage policy and principal airports. Also better than Air Europa on the same route which is twice as expensive.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
London Heathrow - Bilbao return. The aircraft were clean and bright and seating is comfortable. There was a great touch from the crew on the outbound flight completing her final checks as she passed down the aisle she leaned over and turned on the reading light of anyone with a newspaper or book open before the cabin lights were dimmed for take off. The buy-on-board food offering is different and interesting and not the most over-priced.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Our ticket which was bought 2 months in advance was changed to another date. Nobody cares that this ticket is a part of big trip from Barcelona to Prague and then to Bern. Nobody cares that extra two days that we are forced to stay in Barcelona will bring additional expenses which we might not afford. We've sent 4 letters and called to the Customer Center but result was the same - we can refund your ticket or change. But they can't provide us services that we paid for. Once again - trip was planned 2 months ago and tickets were bought also 2 months ago. Now 2 weeks before our flight they change it and don't solve the problem just repeating the same phrase "refund or change".

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Brussels-Valencia. Fares below the other company but all the options that you choose have to be paid extra : if you choose your seat if you pay by credit card if you have luggage etc etc. It doesn't look cheap anymore. Moreover I had to add a luggage to my reservation and this cannot be done online. I had to call the customer service - which charge you around 0.5 cents/min - and waited about 5 minutes without being helped. I used to be a fan of Vueling but not anymore.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
They overbooked the flight by more than 30 passengers (Bilbao-Barcelona). No complaint on the quality of seats and service. However I don't think it is a reliable airline if you want to be sure that you're flying the day you want. In my case they cancelled a previous flight without notice and respositioned all passengers in our flight leaving 30 of us at home.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
MXP-BCN and BCN-ALC. Very impressed by this low cost airline. Seats comfortable and cabin crew professional. Leg room very tight but fares were low on the flights I took. Would fly them again.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Used twice from Brussels to Vigo Spain. Flights on schedule aircraft clean and cabin crew polite and efficient. No problem with check-in procedures and luggage handling.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
A 30 minute delay on flight. Staff were friendly and helpful. Cost of flight was excellent. I followed their luggage weight requirements and did not have any problems and luggage was waiting for me on arrival.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Malaga to Barcelona return. Outbound flight on time and what might be expected of a budget airline. We arrived at the airport for our return flight very early and noticed a much earlier flight to Malaga on the departures board. Asked for a change of flight and surprised to be offered a choice of seats sent to a special check-in desk (because the flight was due to leave in 45 minutes) no additional charge and it was done with a smile.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
LHR-Bilbao. Seats allocated at check-in. Inbound aircraft late and very late gate allocation in terminal 3 which was busy. Arrived at gate to find aircraft just on stand however boarding commenced very quickly. First impressions of aircraft extremely poor. Over 25 aisle armrests broken and removed with temporary tape visible and the carpet was virtually non existent with chewing gum marks all over the place. Toilets had not been cleaned or restocked with paperware and one toilet at the rear had temporary repairs. A very poor impression and even though this is a low cost carrier the fares are not low on this route due to lack of competition. It is also in codeshare with Iberia and presents a poor image of this company too. Service was efficient and friendly to those that wanted to purchase items. Little information with regard to delay of inbound aircraft and announcements unclear and with little confidence in speaking English. Sadly the poor aircraft appearance detracted from a very average experience.

Recent trip Seville to Paris. On time. Clean plane. Friendly staff with good English. Excellent seats near emergency doors

### Vueling Airlines customer review
If only I had read these comments before! I'm writing this comment from TLV waiting for my flight to Barcelona which should have departed at 0400 - it is 1040 and the board shows that the current time for departure is 1230 (hopefully). The official cause is a technical problem - week after another? Take my advice go to another air line company!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
When the going gets tough Vueling doesnt want to know. Flight was cancelled due to French Air traffic control strike - not the airlines fault. The total disinterest and rudeness of the check in staff when trying to get help is not. Was brushed off to call various numbers all in Spain and all busy and all timed out. In the end no choice but to leave airport not knowing what was going on. A total lack of information unwillingness to try and give any advice shows that as cheap airlines go this one has scraped the bottom when it comes to customer care.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Tel Aviv to Barcelona. We had a 16 hour delay because the plane broke down on it's way to us and no other aircraft was put in. We should have landed in Barcelona early in the morning but landed after midnight. My son flew 5 days later and had 4 hours delay. Furthermore his flight was filled with people from a previous flight (2 days before) which was cancelled altogether without them even notifying the passengers.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
FCO-BCN Clean aircraft and kind crew: however seats not so comfortable. Price competitive but not cheap : 80 euros return only 20 euros less than Iberia or Alitalia and with no baggage. Iberia was offering a 100 euros return ticket with baggage allowed up to 15 kg I suppose and miles earned on Iberia Plus. Just to underline that it is not a low-cost price. Great ground staff in Barcelona.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
LHR-La Coruna on 7 Sept 2010. Flight delayed because of french air traffic control strike - fair enough the airline cannot control this but boarded onto the plane an hour late the doors were then closed and we sat on board for over four hours before the plane actually departed. During this time and the flight - no drinks / food service was offered to passengers as they had apparently run out as the inbound flight had eaten / drunk all the provisions. Just to make the experience complete we were then diverted to Santiago as Coruna airport had closed for the night and then had to get the coach back to La Coruna. What should be a 1.5 hour trip from LHR - turned out to be an epic nine hours.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Barcelona to Madrid the flight was supposed to leave at 2045 and was delayed with no clear reason and nobody gave all passangers a clear answer of what was happening. Finally the flight took off but at 0200 the next morning and the only reason they gave was 'this is a low cost airline what else can you expect'. The price was lower than other airlines but wasn't cheap.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
BCN-MAD-BCN. The flight to Madrid was on time and nice. I also got a seat next to the window because I questioned at the Check In. But the return flight was delayed and then we didn't know on which Gate the boarding starts FAs were rude to passengers!

### Vueling Airlines customer review
IBZ-CDG plane was dirty - carpet seats pockets was full of garbage! My seat was broken and the armrest was gone. The crew was young but not nice. I couldn't get a word during the announcements in English.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
BCN-AMS return on A320. Overall happy with experience although as others have noted this is a low-cost carrier so expectations should be kept low as per inflight service. Checked in online no problems. Purchased extra-legroom seats they were honoured and had loads of space although it should be noted that these seats do not recline so you are also losing some comfort. The return flight was not full and some passengers moved to these seats for free but then again its only 12 euros extra. Flight attendants were young friendly and professional. Flight to Amsterdam left the gate more or less on time but spent 20 minutes taxing to the runway. Flight back left nearly an hour late due to incoming flight arriving late in fairness they did an incredibly fast turnaround and they apologized for the inconvenience. Would not want to use them to connect to an intercontinental flight but for leisure travel will use again.

Zürich to Santiago de Compostela and return. Nothing special a usual flight as you would expect from a low cost airline. Fair price good value for money. 30 minutes late on the return leg due to air controller strike in France.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
BCN-ORY. Flight delayed 30 min leaving for Paris and an hour on my return to Barcelona. Seats offer little legroom for people over 6 ft but I have this problem on most airlines. Staff at check-in nice and assigned exit row seat on my return trip to Barcelona. Staff on plane very nice professional and fluent in English. Do have to pay for drinks and snacks which is expected on budget airline.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Customer service is awful. Their website doesn't work for me to book online so I had to call customer service. Apparently only 1 person speaks English there and even so not well which made the phone call I had to pay for even more expensive. I had to call to book because "their" site wasn't working. On top of paying for the phone call I had to pay 10€ to book over the phone! The rep gave me a 20€ voucher for the next booking which I must make over the phone putting me in the same situation again. Not worth the hassle. Trip was fine though plane had not been cleaned.

### Vueling Airlines customer review
Rome to Paris flight delayed for over 2 hours. And for at least 15 minutes the flight was removed (disappeared) from the departures board. No staff in airport to answer questions. Staff showed up after 2 hours at a different gate and they were the most incompetent least helpful of any I've ever encountered. They should be trained. Vueling makes EasyJet look like Singapore Airlines.
