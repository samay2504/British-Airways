### "Departure time was uncertain"
Tanahmerah to Korowai Batu. This route is a government-subsidized one operated with tiny aircraft carrying only about a dozen passengers. No advance booking possible but Dimonim staff were helpful in getting us on a flight the same day. Departure time was uncertain but we eventually got on the plane. Once aboard it was a great flight offering sweeping views of the rivers and rain forests below. Cheap, too.
