### "Perfect onboard service"
Perfect onboard service. Crew was nice, polite and do everything to make me satisfied. Meal service was pretty good, including Michelin restaurant meal.

### “the seat is super tight”
Very bad. Small plane and the seat is super tight. Seat has no inclination. Suffer for the entire 4-5 hours of flight. I thought EVA was bad due to their arrogance, but this is worse in terms of comfort.

### "comfortable business class"
Very comfortable business class A321neo and surprisingly spacious. Food includes special ingredients creates premium touch. Staff are professional (smiles, attitudes, word choices). Free wifi coupon easily redeemed day before flight. Not many movie choices especially for children but good noise cancelling headphones.

### “Service on both flights was truly first class”
Not Verified |  I flew China Airlines (of Taiwan) from Vienna to Taipei in December (with an onward journey to Bangkok) and Taipei to Vienna in January in their business class. The cabin of the A350 was kept clean and the equipment is modern (despite not having a privacy door, the privacy was great). A350 is definitely my favorite airplane - I have much less jetlag after long haul flights. I heard the airline is upgrading its product in 2 years. Service on both flights was truly first class. Very engaging and friendly and nothing is too much trouble for the crew. On the outbound flight the crew working in my section was super professional - on par with the standard offered by Singapore Airlines. On my return journey Magret was super friendly and take personal care of the passengers. The cabin manager on the return journey was also very pleasant and helpful. Food onborad was excellent. China Airlines, unlike its competitor EVA or Starlux, doesnt offer an intensive menu but the food and drink quality is really good. On the way back I chose the course prepared by a Michelin 3 star restuanrat in Taipei - but my favorite is always the special vegetarian food (which is also Michelin star and you need to pre-order online). The lounge in Taipei is either very busy (morning peak hours and also evening) or very quiet. There is no natural light so it is dark. However it is tastefully decorated and the food was very tasty. Service, like their onboard standard, was very personal and friendly. There is always a queue for the shower (due to the terminal size, the lounge isn't large. Hopefully this will be addressed once Terminal 3 opens) so make sure you put your request in early. Onboard wifi worked well and there is no data cap - that is a huge bonus. Now comes the cons - the business class seat on A350 is equipped with a very large and clear monitor but the entertainment choice is fairly limited - not sufficient movies/TV/music to keep me occupied. Also the seat and amenity is great (especially the duvet) but when the seat is fully flat, the leg space becomes a bit constrain.

### “Lovely crew”
Lovely crew. Very clean plane and rather comfy seating. The “seat belt” - sign was on most of the flight although not much turbulence. Quite many announcements. The food was fine but wine glasses very small.

### "the service was excellent"
Very smooth and pleasant check-in. The Dynasty Lounge at Narita is very large and comfortable but with a limited range of food and drink. Onboard the service was excellent and my vegetarian meal was tasty. The seat was an old style regional seat with limited recline and storage. At Taipei the lounge was comfortable with a range of delicious snacks and meals. We transferred to another regional A330 with more comfortable seats than the previous flight. They converted into a rather lumpy angled bed. This flight had been advertised as an A350 with modern lie-flat business class seats, a plane which was now "under maintenance". As compensation an upgrade voucher with 12 months' validity was provided, but with our current travel plans it is difficult to see how we could use it. On board service was excellent again and the vegetarian meals were copious and of good quality. The flight arrived in good time, but our baggage took a long time to arrive (though business class luggage was delivered first). Despite the aircraft downgrade I think that China Airlines is a good value way to fly between Australia and Japan.

### "service was friendly and responsive"
The Plaza Business Lounge at Brisbane Airport was comfortable enough with a range of food and drinks (but no tonic for a G&T). There were very few toilets in the lounge though. On board the A350 the seat was comfortable and the service was friendly and responsive. My vegetarian meals were good, but breakfast was served far too early, interrupting sleep. The plane for the connecting service to Sapporo was an unreconstructed A330 with old-style business class seating -- but comfortable enough for a 4-hour flight. The service and vegetarian food out of Taipei were both excellent. Overall China Airlines is a good way to travel between Australia and Japan at a reasonable price.

### "surprised about the seat quality"
Tried Premium Economy class and I was surprised about the seat quality and onboard meals. This class also included amenity kit, which I appreciate. Cabin crew nicely handle my 3yo child.

### "Plenty of legroom"
Not Verified |  Have just flown to Brisbane and return with China Airlines. Superb aircraft. Plenty of legroom nice and airy good service good IFE. Only downside were the meals. Worse than a tv dinner . Chicken and rice a few pieces of fruit and a KitKat bar. No hot drink offered on either flight. Nice playing cards available on request which is unusual these days. Certainly the best carrier on this route.

### "comfortable with good service"
I flew China Airlines from Singapore to Vancouver on the 21st June 2024 by Premier Economy. The flight was not very full but dep from Singapore again delayed by 30 minutes. Due to this the Airline allows another extra 30 minutes in its schedule! We landed at Taipei 10 minutes late only & after a wait of 5 hrs -took off for Vancouver on the second leg of my journey. This flight was unfortunately delayed by 30 minutes at Taipei due to "baggage loading" issues etc. We landed at Vancouver 25 minutes late as a result of the late take off. The flight however was very smooth & comfortable. Cabin Crew was very good & cleaned the toilets every 3 hrs -so they remained "spic & span" & were well stocked. Entertainment system was very good though on Singapore-Taipei sector my Screen had no sound & I had to change my Seat. The food I always eat on flights is AVML (Indian Veg Meal) & this varied in quality. Singapore-Taipei meal was very good -though it lacked Indian Bread (bun provided) & No Plain Yoghurt & I would rate it 7.5/10. On the Taipei -Vancouver Sector the Dinner was " below par" & only the fine quality basmati rice & north indian tasting veg & fruits was edible.I would rate this 4/10 only. The breakfast (second meal) was better as they provided Parotta with Indian cauliflower & potato curry & cabbage curry-both tasty. Again fruits were provided (Banana should have been given). I would rate this meal 5.5/10. No Plain Yoghurt (an essential part of every Indian Veg meal was provided. Fortunately I always carry my own Yoghurt & Indian Pickle packets, so I could repair the meals & enjoy them . I hope China Airlines pays attention to my comments & modifies their AVML meals to include more Yoghurt & Indian breads in future. The Seat was very comfortable & with 2-3-2 seating in Premier Economy. Baggage was well handled & no damages & was quickly discharged at Vancouver Airport. Overall view of China Airlines & the Flight can be described as relaxed, comfortable with good service & ambience. A last word on the A-350-900 Aircraft which in my view is excellent for such a long flight, smooth ,stable & very spacious. I will continue to fly by China Airlines in my future flights to Asia.

### “Horrific customer experience”
Horrific customer experience after being left in the queue by the airline. We arrived at Taoyuan Airport in Taiwan to check into our flight back to London 2 hours before departure. The airport was extremely busy and, in each section, it was nearly impossible to move between the lines of passengers zig-zagging away from the check-in desks and up the corridor. Our own set of check-in counters (Area 11) appeared to be handling 8 flights, most of which were departing at around the same time. We managed to reach the check-in desk around 7:30am (30 mins before departure) and was told that the flight was closed and we could not check in. During that time, nobody went past us with a sign, changed the signs over the check in counters or called our flight loud enough to hear, and there were no staff members available to speak to. We were aware of the time, so we were looking for staff holding signs; neither of us left the line or wore headphones as we were trying to be vigilant. There was nothing to suggest we should just stay in line with everyone else. At the customer support desk, the supervisor (Chang YuHao) tried to help by suggesting he could put us on the Monday flight (2 days later). However, there was no offer to cover our costs (two nights accommodation in a hotel (plus expenses)) and it would mean missing a day of work and my wife’s pregnancy scan. He then suggested that he would speak to the duty manager to see if there were any other solutions. When the duty manager (Liao ChiaRu) arrived at 9:30 am (nearly 1.5 hours after we arrived at the support desk), he refused to offer any solution. He claimed he had made the announcement himself, but we never saw him (in connection with our flight or others). He acknowledged that his voice might not have been loud enough (to which we pointed out the need to use a microphone or the screens at the counter to display messages on such a busy day. Where the supervisor had tried to find a solution, the duty manager made clear that it was our fault that we were stuck in the line at the counter. When I told him that my wife was pregnant and needed to get home, he laughed at me and then walked away and we never saw him again. To be clear, my wife is Taiwanese and spoke Mandarin to him, so there was no miscommunication. The supervisor then discussed alternatives with him in the back room and told us that the duty manager had refused to move us onto another flight and left us with the choice of (a) flying out two days later, or (b) cancelling the flight and finding an alternative (with a fee of £181 per person applied as a late cancellation fee). This was clearly not helpful as either option would cost us a fortune and we had not done anything wrong. In the end, we spent £1200 to get a Thai Airways flight home. This is an appalling way to treat customers who have complied with their obligations and no way to act as an airline.

### "Seat was spacious & very comfortable"
I flew by China Airlines Premium Economy from Vancouver (BC) to Singapore via Taipei on 27 th May 2024. The flight took off ON time & landed in Taipei 30 minutes before time. The flight from Taipei took off 15 mts late but landed 15 minutes early at Singapore. The Aircraft used for both flights was A350-900 Airbus. However on Taipei Singapore-"leg", one of the China Airlines "Chartered" Plane with 2-4-2 Seating in Premier Economy unlike the Standard 2-3-2 found on China Airlines A-350. The Flight from Vancouver to Taipei has some rough turbulence just before Japan & meal service had to be suspended for about 45 mts. Otherwise the flights were smooth. The Aircraft, Toilets etc were clean & well kept. The Seat was spacious & very comfortable & ideal for a 12 hrs flight. The Cabin Service was very good & nowadays more China Airlines Staff speak English- so communication not a problem. I had ordered AVML Meals on the Vancouver to Taipei Sector & VLML meal on Taipei- Singapore Sector. Surprisingly the AVML Hot meals from Vancouver were tasty (first time I experienced this). Unfortunately the 'Starters "were a flop & did not have any resemblance to AVML food. China Airlines should study Indian Culture further to understand the "tastes of Indian Starter foods" etc. Further once again None of the three meals had plain natural Yoghurt served with meals. China Airlines should note that Plain Yoghurt constitutes the major part of EVERY AVML meal & I trust the Airline Catering will take note of this point & correct it in future meals served. The VLML meal was a baked mixed Veg pasta. Nice, Hot & Tasty - though the Starter disappointed. Another point was the lack of Salt & Pepper packets wiith meals. These should be given on request. Entertainment was good. Baggage handling was efficient & good as always. Finally a word of appreciation for the smooth transfer of passengers at Taipei Airport. I can state this is the best I have seen.

### "traditional Taiwanese hospitality"
On this red eye flight, dinner was served on a tray with canapés and dessert served separately. The cabin manager introduced herself to me in Mandarin and served a pre-departure drink. I slept after the meal service on the flat bed on this 4.5 hour flight to TPE. The service exudes traditional Taiwanese hospitality that was natural. I can sense that service DNA is deeply ingrained in their flight attendants. I will definitely fly CI again.

### "professional and friendly crew"
Had an enjoyable flight with China Airlines (CI) from Taipei - Taiwan to Ho Chi Minh city. Flight was on time with professional and friendly crew. Seat was comfortable with generous legroom. We liked the wooden-look-like interior of the craft, felt warm and elegant. The meal was quite pleasant to us. We also appreciated that the chief purser came to our seats and greeted us by our names, provided some information about the flight, as we were Skyteam Elite Plus members.

### "an average experience"
I flew with my elderly father in May 2 2024, Flight C124 from Taipei to Los Angeles. Overall it was an average experience. However; I would like to show my gratitude towards the Cabin Chief on that flight, she's amazingly kind and professional. My father needed extra care, and she personally delivered.

### "a terrible experience"
China Airlines from LAX to Taipei to Manila was a terrible experience from beginning to end. Firstly the flight from LAX was delayed for over 1 hr for inexplicable reasons. Amazingly, despite this, it turned out that most of the luggage did not get put on the flight, something we didn't discover until after we cleared immigration and noticed that our luggage wasn't coming through on baggage 5. Imagine we were had a sign to go to baggage 5 and still most of us were not informed that the majority of the luggage never left LAX. So after waiting for 1/2 hr hoping that our luggage would show up, we then had to wait in another line for 30-45 mins. for an understaffed desk to hear our fate. We had 4 pcs of luggage to come from LA and were told that they were still in LA but promised that we should expect to get them flown from LA and should get them delivered to us the next evening. They promised to call that day later for an update and never did. We expected to arrive in Manila at about 1AM and left about 4AM because of all we had endured. We had to try so many times to hear the phone no. we were told to call, ring incessantly. Occasionally, someone would answer and we were told that a driver would deliver 2 items but no one showed up. Finally we got all 4 pcs together almost 48 hrs after we arrived. Oh, by the way, the 3 meals we got (2 to Taiepi and one Manila) were tasteless and unappetizing. We have traveled through the years on other Asian airlines, and now the first time on China Airlines, and China Airlines has by far the worst food. It didn't matter that the 3rd meal didn't have a 2nd option. My wife and I ordered different meals for the first leg, and both hated it. We arrived in Manila exhausted and hungry. Then China Airlines sent us each a survey (not sure if it was because of our atrocious experience or not). Regardless the first page which was only a cover page allowed us to click on English. However, the rest of the survey was only in Chinese. China Airlines get a 1/10 for getting us to Manila safely, but so do most other airlines. So they need to be judged on other things for which they failed miserably. My wife and I, and pretty much all the customers who arrived in Manila to only discover that their luggage was still in LA, unanimously agreed that even if they are the cheapest we will never use them again. And oh yes, one leg of a suitcase was broken.

### "service on the flight was fantastic"
Not Verified |   An old Boeing 737-800 with the slightly dated interior and without the flat bed and personal entertainment. However for the short duration the space was comfortable. China Airlines allows passengers to use their smartphone or tablet to connect to inflight wifi and stream the TV/movie/music and also a flight map. I prefer this to a fix screen. The service on the flight was fantastic. From friendly welcome to meal service, the crew provided a first class service. Meal and drinks provided were of great quality. We took off on time and landed slightly early in Seoul.

### "ground crew were excellent"
Not Verified | I cannot praise China Airlines highly enough. I was just released from hospital and my mobility was poor. The ground crew were excellent and the hostesses on both legs of my flight couldn't do enough to make me comfortable and assist me. The planes were great and the leg room was fine for a big man. I enjoyed the food and it's quality was far better than many airlines.

### "Price far lower than competitors"
Amazing. Actually exceeded all expectations. Spotless clean plane. Left early, arrived early. Crew were receptive and prompt. Love the A350, so spacious vs Boeing 787/777/A330. Price was far lower than competitors and better service. Used wifi, not fast but efficient.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Worst airline I have ever flown. Very unfriendly staff. After boarding the flight attendant checked the phones if we have flight mode. Later I got my drink in already used paper cup. Bread was not fresh as half was soft half super hard. Also it is like lowcost airlines - you need to pay for everything - there is no free internet like in other good airlines, you need to pay for seats in first or exit rows. When I wrote my experience to their Facebook chat they read it, but none responded to me. I expect at least something like we apologise for that. The staff took perfect care about Chinese speaking customers. Others were for them like people of the second category. Many items from duty free shop insert on screen you can purchase only flights within Asia and when is your delivery address in Asia. But they insert it on flight to Europe so it makes especially kids very upset that they want something and they can't get it.

### “pleasantly surprised at the food”
Such a good flight from TPE-LHR. Very pleasantly surprised at the food and the comfort of the seat on this long haul flight considering I fly China Air in Asia a lot without the same level of comfort. The economy section was reasonably empty so they allowed an empty seat between most passengers which gave a lot of room. Wide range of movies - so much so I watched 6 movies on the trip. Bathrooms not very clean though. 2 meals provided and a bread roll at about 3 pm London time. Did not notice if water/drinks handed out aside from mealtimes.

### "I had two very good flights"
Frankfurt – Taipei return in Economy. Check-in was fast and friendly. China Airlines is the only airline I know which allows you to take 2 checked bags in Economy. The cabin is amazing with very comfortable seats and enough legroom. Cabin staff was very friendly and attentive. They offered water during the whole flight and kept the lavatories clean. Two good hot meals were served and there were free snacks and drinks at the galley. Entertainment was okay with a reasonable selection of movies but I’ve seen better before. WIFI was also available at reasonable costs. All in all I had two very good flights with China Airlines.

### "Awful from start to finish"
Awful from start to finish. At check in 3 hours ahead of time I was advised I needed to book a flight leaving Taiwan to enter the country. This was not detailed at any stage of the booking process. Check in manager advised this was the responsibility of the travel agent - I pointed out I booked direct with China Airlines. WiFi at check in was too patchy to book and they wouldn't let me proceed to the business lounge to use their WiFi, which was the easiest solution by far. Instead I was eventually taken to their offices, upstairs at the other end of the check in hall. It took 30 minutes to book under a stressful situation and timeline running away fast. One member of staff in the office was very abrupt and rude. Immigration was slow, so I was now even more stressed and there was NO priority lane at security for business class. Check in staff didn't advise which business lounge, or its location, so I only got there 5 minutes before boarding, which was useless. Finally, boarding was late and they started boarding economy class first (who does that - what are we paying for?) so queries once again with everyone else. Finally got to my seat and found even though I was first to check in I'd been allocated a seat next to someone else, when for early check in, you'd expect they'd have placed me on my own. All in all this gets a 2 for it being a business class seat, but it's the lack of stress you pay for a business ticket on this type of short 2 hour journey. With that they failed miserable. Awful stressful trip from start to finish. No redeeming features at this price. Never again.

### "worst airlines for customer service"
Not Verified | Hands down one of the worst airlines for customer service!! You take money off people who couldn’t make there flight with the promise of redeeming there return ticket for the set price you had mentioned on the phone! Once that was paid you slap an extra 7000nt on to the ticket price. Disgusting behaviour hang your head in shame! I’ll never use China Airlines again.

### "impossible to contact them"
Not Verified | I had to cancel my booking because I made a mistake in my name. China Airlines has very struct rules, so I had to cancel and book a new flight. I cancelled in February and now, 9 months later, I still didn't receive the refund. It is almost impossible to contact them and they promised several to check it, but still no reaction at all!

### "Overall a good flight"
We flew in Premier Economy (3 Adults & a 16 month old infant). Premium Economy seats etc were very good & overall feeling was of comfort. The Seats slid in their shells & angle was good. We had requested AVML Meals for both Sectors in advance. A Meal was served between Singapore & Taipei which was satisfactory & could have been better -had not the caterer ruined it with some Dahi Bhalla tasteless dish! (It should have been spicy Dahi Vada instead!). On the Taipei -Vancouver Sector, the two meals served were not upto the mark. Also dishes had no salt and pepper & we had to use the packets we always carry in our bag . The Cabin Crew were satisfactory , though some of them seemed to spend more time chatting amongst themselves. Crew from Singapore to Taipei was " Sloppy" - spilling fruit juices on the carpet &. English language communication was not good too. The two toilets in the Premier Economy were in general clean but on the Taipei Vancouver Sector the Port side toilet was often dirty & uncleaned. The Entertainment was OK but could have been better. Baggage was well handled. Overall a good flight & China Airlines can be recommended.

### "food was very average"
I have been flying China Airlines (Taipei) for nearly 30 years & flying between Singapore & Vancouver for past 24 yrs. The Airline has always been professionally operated with clean cabins & immaculate Toilets (cleaned frequently by the Cabin Crew). In the past I flew in 737-400 Aircraft, 747-400, A-330 Airbus & most recently by A-350-900 Airbus respectively. All the planes were good & comfortable in the Economy Class I flew. Recently I flew in the Premium Economy Class & was impressed with the Seat & its comfort. (Better than Business Class "Split folding Angular Seats" in many Airlines). Leg room, comfort was excellent. The Video monitor was large & excellent . Baggage handling was good & smooth. The only point which did not meet my expectations was the food . I always order AVML meals (as I am a Vegetarian) & I noticed the meals lifted from Vancouver Airport are the "Worst" in the world with the caterer not having a clear concept of what constitutes an AVML (which is usually an Indian Bread, Garden Veg Curry, Plain Yoghurt, Indian Sweet & the distinctive Indian flavour taste. Further the rice used was "low grade" rice when usually it is the Basmati brand of fine Indian Rice. Sadly all this was lacking & the Caterer I believe should be changed & switched to someone who has understanding of what is an Indian AVML meal. The food from Taipei too sadly was very average. (I had better AVML meals in the past from China Airlines). The snack offerings too were very oriental & had contents which do not constitute International tastes. It is for this reason that I always carry my small packet of nuts etc & plain Yoghurt x 100 ml for my flights. Barring my disappointment at the Food served, the Aircraft was good, clean & comfortable. There were two toilets provided for Premier Economy to be shared by Business Class also. However I noticed that the number of toilets in economy has been reduced from the Standard 6 (for Airbus) to 5 now -probably to fit in additional Seats which is not good for passengers comfort. Customer Service centre was contactable on phone from Canada & efficient. These are my thoughts on the recent flight by China Airlines from YVR to SIN.

### "real bad impact and impression"
I was checking in at the check-in counter in the San Francisco International airport the other day. The check-in counter agent he was rude and impatient to talk to me and handle my business. His manners were unfriendly. These are real bad impact and impression. Let me want to think twice if I can get other airlines with similar prices maybe. When I flew out from Taipei to San Francisco several days ago other than going back to Taipei, the check-in counter agent was very very friendly and helpful. It was highly appreciated.

### "a very nice experience"
I read some of the reviews on the website and nearly did not get the tickets. I could not have been more wrong. The check in was done promptly and we left on time and arrived slightly earlier than expected. The seats were comfortable and the service was good. Entertainment programme was good too! Overall a very nice experience.

### "China Airlines app didn't work"
Not Verified |  Check in Staff that are employees of China Airlines asked me to show proof of my connecting flight from Bangkok to Siem Reap which was with another airline because my return flight was Phnom Penh to Vancouver via Taipei while my departure flight was Vancouver to Bangkok via Taipei. I did comply and while I was politely asking about the policy the check in agent said that if I didn't show proof of my connecting flight they wouldn't let me board. Also, the China Airlines app didn't work so I couldn't check in and the stewards didn't return to pick up any extra garbage.

### "Never, ever fly China Airlines"
Not Verified |  Because we missed our JFK connection our incoming flight was late, so China Airlines suspended our tickets. What is "suspension? a normal person might ask. Suspension is a special thing China Airlines does. It freezes your ticket so that not even the airline that delayed you can rebook you. Then, China Airlines' office doesn't open till 12 noon. This was sad news at 2am at JFK. When they did open, they did not answer the phone -- we were on hold for 2 hours 13 minutes before some Tool picked up to inform me that, because we failed to present ourselves, China Air was imposing a $150 per ticket fee to release the tickets. After over an hour and the usual escalation, the Tool gave me a phone number and email address to which JetBlue must present evidence that their flight was late so they'd release the tickets graciously without the fee, like any normal airline would any day. So, after 15 hours on nearly continuous phone calls in the airport, we got clearance to rebook, and Jet Blue put us on Cathay Pacific. Returning home, we checked our bags through to Orlando, knowing we'd have to clear customs & recheck them in NY. Now China Airlines explained that they don't think they can get our bags from one terminal to the next within the next 9 hours for our next flight. And the food was ghastly to boot. Never, ever fly China Airlines.

### "never been treated so badly"
I have never been treated so badly on any other airline I have flown. The stewardesses were terrible and repeatedly lied to me about my seating arrangement. I paid an extra $200 per flight for a seat that showed as having extra legroom and so that I could ensure my family were seated together. I have extremely painful small fiber neuropathy in my feet and legs. When my feet became swollen because of being extremely cramped I requested to be moved one seat up to an empty row of seats by the exit. I was informed by stewardess that I would be required to pay an additional $150. A little later in the flight they moved an early twenties woman into that seat free of charged because she had complained that an older lady had bumped her seat from behind. I questioned the stewardess that denied my request and that was the explanation given to me. A little later the head stewardess told me it was because the ladies seat would not recline. I personally checked her seat on the way off the plane and it functioned and fully reclined. Meanwhile my legs were trapped by a fully reclined seat now occupied by the 20 year old. My feet and legs continued to swell and were extremely painful. I don’t appreciate being repeatedly lied to by their staff. They were cold and uncaring to a disabled elderly person. The seating is intolerable to anyone 6’ or taller. They were completely un compassionate to my situation. I will never fly this airline again.

### "8 hours in a rather cramped economy seat"
I would rarely give high mark to a flight that was four hours late and involved temporary rerouting to another airport, but China Airlines handled this unexpected weather diversion excellently. 8 hours in a rather cramped economy seat for a flight time of a little over 3:45 minutes is a bit hard on the body. But bad weather can strike at any time, In this case, the captain attempted to land at BKK in a storm and had to abort, After going around he tried from the other direction, but the storm over BKK had hardly moved and so it was a second aborted landing. We were then advised we would have to fly up to Chiang Mai, land there and wait it out while remaining seated. The crew were excellent. Clearly there was no additional food on board (in any case, the late lunch had been more than sufficient) but abundant soft drinks were handed around. An hour for refuelling at Chiang Mai and we were on our way back to BKK, this time with a perfect landing. As we disembarked, no-one was complaining about the extra flight time.

### "Cabin crew was attentive"
The first flight from Koror to Taipei was extraordinary. Cabin crew was attentive calling the passengers by their name. Food was very good too. On the second leg to Singapore on the A350, cabin crew was very nice too but food was average. No amenity kit for a four hour flight. Ground crew in Palau had no idea at all how to Check in a connecting flight nor the luggage allowance for business class.

### "abandoned in the middle of the airport"
I'm writing this review on behalf of my mom who took the flight with China Airlines in the second week of May 2023. I registered her for wheelchair services because of her back and leg problems which restricted her from walking long distance. I confirmed with the agent on the phone that she would be assisted all the way to the end of arrival. Upon landing Vancouver, she was picked up with other customers on wheelchair services in the cart. However, when finishing her custom declare, she found herself abandoned in the middle of the airport. The cart had left without her!! She had to walk all the way to baggage claim and found herself being denied of help with the luggage again. China Airlines customer reps kept passing her from one to another. Speaking no English, it was challenging for her to get connected to the Wifi at the airport. It was almost an hour after arrival that she could reach out to me so that I could sort out the luggage situation with an airport porter. Don't fly with China Airlines if you need assistance.

### "there was no one to help me"
Once in the ground in SFO, despite many assurances, there was no one to help me, and without assistance I was unable to make my connecting flight to Seattle. When I asked staff at SFO about this, they said “I’ll talk to my supervisor and did nothing. Just like they did when I touched down at SFO. The staff member helping me upon seeing I was upset, told me that I did it wrong. That he was at the baggage carrousel and that if I’d have gotten help it might have been different. He told me the plane was on time. (It landed on time then sat on the tarmac for ten minutes). Then no one helped me. He was exceedingly rude, and I told him if he couldn’t help me he shouldn’t have kept me waiting 30 minutes to tell me that. He flipped me off after yelling at me.

### "What kind of airline does that to their passengers?"
This is the first time my mom has flown with China Airlines, she usually flies with ANA where the service is excellent. But this time due to the last minute booking she had to fly with China Airlines, she flew from San Francisco to Jakarta and had a layover in Taipei. When I checked in, I specifically requested assistance with a wheelchair until her final destination because my mom couldn’t walk for too long. From SF they did provide a wheelchair but when my mom got to Taipei, they had the audacity to tell my mom to walk by herself to her next gate. What kind of airline does that to their passengers? We will never fly with China Airlines anymore or recommended it to anyone.

### "wouldn’t use this airline anymore"
When I booked my ticket, the website has only 2 boxes “First name” and “Last name” and I entered my name exactly as that. However, at the checkin counter, the staff said my name was written backwards and did not match my passport. Well of course because the passport is written in my language then it is last name followed by first name, but in English it will be flipped backwards, but it is still correct last name and first name. The airport staff said my ticket is unusable and told me to change. I panicked because it was close to boarding time and the airline website did not work. There’s no way you can edit your info by yourself. Then the staff directed me to the airline hotline which then directed me back to her to edit my name. Why wouldn’t she just change it for me it was wasting my time. I ended up having to pay extra US$50 for the dumb way the airline told passengers to fill in our names. Lost my trust totally this time. I wouldn’t use this airline anymore and recommend no one to use it. You will be better off with other airlines where you won’t have this kind of problem at the airport. Apparently it is a very common problem many people have encountered.

### "everything worked out fine"
Overall a good experience in economy. Online Check-in was easy, the mobile app looks a bit dated but worked as well, boarding passes provided for wallet. Friendly and attentive staff. The special meal I ordered was provided on all flight. Food arlight. Better than many European carriers. Crew walked around plenty of times with water and juice. Decent cabin on B777 with personal IFE, on the A330 older but still functional, good selection of international and recent movies. Seat pitch ok, even for tall people. All flights on time, connection in Taipei without problems and helpful staff available. Not the best flight to blow you away, but everything worked out fine.

### "It was extremely uncomfortable"
I flew the business class with China Airlines from Sydney to Taipei on 3 April 2023. When I purchased the ticket in mid February, the seating plan for the business class indicated 4 seats in each row (I believe it was Airbus 350-900). I selected 14D as mv seat. A few days before departure, I received a notification from China Airlines that my seat was reassigned to 3D (no other messages than that). When I logged into the airlines' web, the new seating plan now showed each row had 6 seats. Without suspicion, I selected 4A as my new seat. When I boarded the aircraft on the day of departure, I realised that China Airlines had substituted this long haul flight with an aircraft suitable only for short haul flights. The seat space for the business class is very limited. The seat can only be laid down to about 45 degrees and there was no room for me to put my legs straight. It was extremely uncomfortable and almost impossible for sleeping (and it was an overnight flight). The supposedly complimentary wifi for the business class did not work for me (I suspect the aircraft was not equipped). The whole experience became a nightmare. I believe it is unethical and dishonest for an airline company to charge the full fares of a long haul flight and then substitute the aircraft with a short haul one, without seeking an agreement from the customers or any compensation. I would have been better off to take the economy class, at least saving myself an extra A$3500 (I paid over A$4800 for round trip).

### "Good service and good trip"
Good service and good trip. Really enjoyed it. I would definitely choose China Airline for next visiting Asia. Fair price compared to the other airlines

### "not impressed with the service"
I travelled with China Airlines a few times with no issues. However on 07/04/23 CI51 Taipei to Sydney I was not impressed with the service provided on board particularly by the male flight attendants. Not paying attention to customers needs on board, or ignoring customers when getting off the flight is disappointing.

### "experience was awful from the start"
Not Verified |  The experience I had with China Airlines was awful from the start. It began at check in when I saw a China Airlines employee holding a sign that said CI005. My booking said CI 007 so I figured I was close to where I needed to be. The China Airlines employee then directed me to the opposite side of the terminal. After walking over there I discovered there was no check in for China airlines. As it turns out the line I needed was directly adjacent to the man that directed me to the other side of the terminal. Didn’t even know his own Airlines check in location. After waiting in line for twenty minutes with no movement, they finally started checking in passengers (since when are check in counters closed). Once the check in line started to move, they processed one about every five minutes. All the while the premium class ticket check in line was empty and those attendants just sitting doing nothing. You would think if they had no premium passengers to check in they would help the economy line no talking with coworkers was clearly more important. Once I finally arrived at the counter, I was told my carryon wouldn’t have to be checked due to weight 8Kg (my backpack was heavier but that was OK for some reason).

### "greatly thankful for her help"
Not Verified |  The flight crew for this flight was beyond amazing. One stewardess named Margo after arriving I noticed that my AirPods I left in the pouch in front my my seat was missing. I tried to dig through it but couldn’t find it. I assumed I dropped it somewhere on the flight and asked Margo if anyone reported finding a airpods laying around. To which she responded no but would help me look for it. She keep looking and managed to dig it out from the pouch. The AirPods had somehow slip in the back region of the fabric and she had manage to dig it out for me. I am beyond grateful and greatly thankful for her help.

### "be careful when you purchase tickets"
I have booked the seats with extra leg space (paid extra) for my return flight to Singapore from Taiwan. Wanted to do online check the day before departure but noticed that the seats are not in order. Tried contacting customer service in Taiwan and email to sales person but remain uncontactable. Went to do physical check in on the day and was accused of changing our seats (which we did not) and asked us to top up TWD$3,084 for the remaining seats with extra room space. The whole process took about one hour. The lady in service told us that this is a system change as they change their airplane so seating arrangement change and the seats that we paid for has been taken up by someone else. They did not offer us seats of equivalent (extra leg space with same price) but told us the seats costs more (TWD$5,394) (front role). The whole process took another 20 minutes. By the time we are done payment, we have to rush to board the plane. So to all the consumers, be careful when you purchase tickets from China Airline. They might change the airplane and screwed up your seatings which u paid extra in the first place. I purchased those seats with extra cots because I am travelling with two elderlies and a year old kid.

### "the leg space is ample"
Not Verified |  The business class cabin of China Airline’s A350 is tastefully done up in warm mahogany colours. A unique feature of the seat is the side table lamp, made of plastic. The seat reclines flat and the leg space is ample. I pre-ordered the braised beef brisket and tendon as main course and found it delicious. Flight attendants were hardworking and friendly in typical Asian style. Noise cancelling headphones were provided. The inflight entertainment selection was adequate for this short 4-hour flight but not the most extensive selection. I would definitely take CI again beyond Taipei.

### "avoid at all cost"
Outdated airplanes, USB ports on seats don’t work, many planes are not WiFi equipped. Operations are inefficient. I would avoid at all cost and book with a better airline.

### "wouldn’t process refund for over a month"
I purchased a ticket with them and after 1 day they canceled it before my departure, saying it was due Covid entry policy. They shouldn’t sell the ticket if it’s not available. Afterwards, they wouldn’t process refund for over a month and I had to fill out a form and provide passport copy etc. If you cancel my ticket, refund instantly and immediately! The staff says they process these manually. Such a joke with and lack of modern technology.

### "A solid performance"
A solid performance. The typical 10 minute delay from Taipei was the only glitch. Anew aircraft, flatbed Business class seats, gracious service and decent food all contributed to the quality of this flight. Avoiding a change in Bangkok is a big plus as well. This airline tries hard to be world class and usually seems to succeed. Whether long, medium, or short haul they strive for greatness and it is appreciated.

### "I am nothing but impressed"
I haven't flown with them for more than a decade because I normally fly with SQ. However the overnight flight to Hokkaido via Taipei is a convenient route. It means transferring in Taipei rather than Tokyo and a transfer in Taipei is pretty comfortable. The website and app is functional but slightly less seamless than the SQ app. It was easy to choose seats and special meals and check details. The service from the crew was excellent. The quality of the food was excellent. The lounge in Taipei is pretty good. The buffet appears small in size but the variety is impressive. Plus the kitchen has a good menu of fresh noodle soups and the like. I'd rank it above almost any other lounge when it comes to quality and variety. Seat comfort was the same as the SQ flat bed seats. They are a bit firm. I found the manual fold down beds to be more comfortable compared to these electronic fully reclining beds. There is in flight wifi included. The in flight entertainment may be less extensive than top ranked airlines. For a 9 hour overnight flight it doesn't matter. I'm yet to take the onward flight to Sapporo so maybe my opinion will change. But so far I am nothing but impressed.

### "a 2-star budget airline"
I had bad experience. From the beginning, when I came to China Airlines Lounge and asked if I could use the Lounge key of my credit cards the receptionist said "No No, we never accept Lounge key. Contact them to ask why they put our lounge to the list. Next, my wife and I were seated separately just because they reserved all seats to sell for some more bucks. It makes China Airlines a 2-star budget airline.

### "excellent all round"
Auckland Taipei flight on the A350 was as good as it could have been. Not overly busy so the crew were not overworked but nonetheless very attentive. Seats comfortable; diabetic meal was tasty and inflight entertainment not too bad. Taipei Bangkok on A330 much busier and the video screen miniscule! Service was also good. Returned later in December from London via Taipei to Sydney both on A350 and again excellent all round. Highly recommend China Airlines

### "only good things to say"
Our trip was Calgary- Vancouver - Taipei -Philippines. I have only good things to say about this airline. I paid for a premium economy seats to provide more comfort to my toddler and it sure did not disappoint. My daughter was very comfortable playing on the floor during the reminder of our time flying to Taipei. No complains on the food as well. My daughter was provided with an adult sized meal when I told Them that she can solid food. The flight attendees were very polite and helpful especially for me who is flying alone with a one year old. I got a lot of extra hands whenever needed. It was a long haul flight but the flight attendants see to it that clean washrooms would still be available to the passengers. I would also like to commend the China airlines crew in Manila, they were all giving exemplary service, they made sure that the passengers understood the process of boarding and transferring airlines

### "The seat is comfortable"
The cabin is clean. The seat is comfortable. The ambience is quiet. Flight attendants are friendly and helpful. The food is delectable and fresh. The price is reasonable.

### "relatively price worthy"
Long trip to get from Europe to Jakarta, but relatively price worthy. Wonderful interiors on both flights, with nice welcoming colours. Food out of Frankfurt quite poor in quality and quantity. In between the meals, no snacks offered on this very long flight, except for some crackers. Generous offerings for drinks if you asked. On the contrary the proactive mid-flight runs to keep passengers hydrated (trays with water and orange juice) weren’t many. Unproblematic transfer in Taipei for the onward journey to Jakarta. Food served on this quite turbulent flight was far better (and larger) than the longer one from Frankfurt to Taipei. Very impressed on how for both flights the boarding process was organised, efficient, clear and quick!

### "Really bad customer service"
Hong Kong to Brisbane via Taipei. Hong Kong to Taipei was Ok, service was reasonable. Taipei to Brisbane was uncomfortable and food selection was poor. While in Australia China Airlines cancelled the return leg Taipei to Hong Kong. I made 2 phone calls and 1 email to their Taipei office explaining that I still wanted to continue with the Brisbane to Taipei leg. Before the flight I received and email stating the refund would be HK$ 4055. At Brisbane I was advised by China Airlines staff to make my own ongoing arrangements. After there flight I received another email saying the refund was now HK$ 460, which is 3.7% of the ticket cost. Really bad customer service at Brisbane and Taoyuan airport and subsequently through emails.

### "help us change flights"
Jakarta to Vancouver via Taipei. First time flying on China Airlines after Expedia mistakenly cancelled our Air Canada booking. We were impressed with the aircraft which looked new and most up to date entertainment system. Our family enjoyed the food, even our children finished their meals and they're picky. What I was most impressed with was their customer service and ability to help us change flights in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic that occurred while we were away. Due to closing borders where we were scheduled to be on our way back home, we had to change our flight to a direct flight back home and we wanted to leave as early as possible. We could get never get through to Expedia at all (after hours on the phone) but China Airlines customer service was more than helpful and they were able make our changes for us and get us home even though we booked through Expedia. Next time I travel to Asia, I would consider China Airlines as a top choice carrier.

### "found it totally unhygienic"
Myself my mother and my husband flew Gatwick to Sydney via Taipei with China Airlines but will never fly with them again. The cabin crew on the first leg of the journey did not speak hardly at all. We could not hear nor understand the announcements so in an emergency it would have been guess work which I find astounding but in general I think its poor customer service. The food was just awful, I know it was 95% Chinese passengers but I think the airline should look at the list of people and cater for those who don't want to eat soggy rice and chicken on both the inbound and outbound flights. The blankets provided were a dirty mustard colour and were way past their use date. The cabin crew all were wearing face masks to protect themselves and passengers but found it totally unhygienic that they wiped down the toilet floors, units and toilet with paper towels and no gloves on, that to me was not only disgusting but a health and safety issue. Overall we all found our experience with China Airlines a very poor one. Never again to be repeated.

### "no regard for consumer rights"
They have no regard for consumer rights and will destroy your itinerary if they dont have enough passengers. Booked a flight for my wife, 3yr old and myself, directly with China Airlines via their webpage for a flight from Singapore to Takamatsu. This included a layover of 20hrs in Taipei which we also booked a nights stay at a hotel for. 1 month prior to departure they brought forward by a day, our TPE to TAK flight. As they did not change the Singapore to TPE flight the connection is now impossible. They rectified the problem by changing our SIN to TPE flight a day earlier but refused to make up for our lost hotel booking. We rebooked our hotel at our own cost. 11 days before departure, they changed our TPE to TAK flight again bringing it forward by 24hrs and again neglecting to make the appropriate amendment for SG to TPE. They have also again refused to compensate us in any way for having to book a hotel for the 3rd time. Warning! It looks cheap and respectable. It is a lie.

### "seat pitch was below average"
The check-in in this case was a bit more complex, because my flight ability in Taipei had to be obtained through a stay in China. However, this can be assessed as positive for the health of other passengers. Departures and arrivals were on time. The A330 made a somewhat older impression and the seat pitch was below average. In the A350, on the other hand, cleanliness, comfort and seat spacing were good. The on-board entertainment left nothing to be desired and relatively new films were shown. Catering and drinks are very good and extensive. The staff friendly and helpful. Overall a good experience.

### "a good experience"
Frankfurt to Shanghai via Taipei. Check-in was extremely quick and the staff very friendly. The departure was on time. The seat spacing is average in an international comparison. The on-board catering is very good and very extensive. The beverage service leaves nothing to be desired. Aircraft cleanliness contributed to well-being. Overall a good experience. The Inflight Entertainment offered relatively new and a lot of films.

### "I was upgraded to Premium economy"
Ho Chi Minh city to Frankfurt via Taipei, a good experience overall. I departed at 05:45 p.m., and meals were served 3 times, 1 dinner in the connecting flight from HCMC to Taipei and 2 on the flight from Taipei to Frankfurt. The food was good, but there were not many options and the menu was the same for both departing and returning flights. The crew were friendly and caring, they noticed when I felt uncomfortable due to low temperature inside the cabin and offered hot drinks. The seat was comfortable. I'm a rather small girl (162cm in height), so I had no problem with legroom, but it might have been a bit cramped for some other passengers around me. My returning date was a busy day for Frankfurt airport, so I had a delayed takeoff, which made me miss my connecting flight from Taipei to HCMC. I had a long delay at Taoyuan airport. The airlines handled the situation well, they offered me to stay in their lounge and took care of my baggage, coupons for food and bevarage were also given. The best part was I was upgraded to Premium economy on my flight back to HCMC.

### "Great short-haul flight"
Great short-haul flight from Hong Kong to Tainan operated by Mandarin Airlines (owned by China Airlines). Departure and arrival on time. Plane modern, clean and comfy, considering short length of journey. Hot meal, snack and tea distributed during 1h flight - really appreciated. Staff very nice and active during entire flight.

### "we recommend this airline"
Vancouver to Bangkok via Taipei. We took 4 flights in all. The service was friendly, meals were enjoyable, and there was plenty of video entertainment. Baggage was included in the ticket price. The accommodation was comfortable and we recommend this airline.

### "customer is the one that is blamed"
Not Verified |  Taipei to Frankfurt. I am really upset about China Airline customer service and the abuse of regulations. I book my tickets via Expedia, and Expedia asks their users to input the names as: Family name, Middle Name, First Name. I input as it asks and they arrange my name as Western Order by Family name First Name Middle Name. This is a common way, even western government department does this to Asian name order. When I booked my ticket, Expedia forwarded my info to China Airline and I got charged 100€ for changing my name on the tickets. I booked through Expedia all the time with other Airlines and there has been no problem. With the pressure in the airport, I had to pay. Later I contact China Airline with this complaint and they act like this is my fault. That is really ignorant attitude from China Airlines. I explained to them in details, and they were pushing the problems to their regulation and Expedia. I am sure this is a systematic problem between Expedia and China Airlines, however the customer is the one that is blamed and paid the money. They reject my claim and complaint and complaint but doesn’t do better than abusing their regulations towards customers. As my first time flying, I feel mistrusted towards this airline.

### "no announcement on the aircraft"
Bangkok to Taipei. I fail to understand why this flight and the return leg arrived at and departed from Terminal 2. The ticket specifies Terminal 1, Immigration and baggage delivery are at Terminal 1 and the return check-in is at Terminal 1. This is not the first time this has happened on a CI flight. So why does CI not have proper facilities in Terminal 2 or mark the ticket information as Terminal 2? As far as I am aware, on arrival at TPE there was no announcement on the aircraft and no printed announcement on the video monitors. Passengers were therefore left with a weakly written and seemingly unimportant sign on exiting the Gate ramp. But a China Airlines attendant stood right in front and in the middle of that sign rendering it impossible to read. And her main job seemed to be to direct passengers en route to a soon departing Fukuoka flight since the Bangkok flight had arrived late. The only sign exiting passengers can easily see is the bright illuminated sign above stating that for Immigration passengers should turn right. That, though, is for Terminal 2 Immigration and baggage claim. The handwritten sign that should be in very large thick clear lettering easily visible to all disembarking passengers pointed out that those going to Terminal 1 should actually turn left and then walk a very long way. A staff member giving instructions in Chinese is of little use to those not conversant in the language! Having been caught out by this once before and wasted almost an hour, after this flight I stopped and took time to check the sign carefully. This unthought-through action apart, the flight was smooth and the meal very tasty. My only other gripe about China Airlines is the headphones for the IFE. It makes available the ancient circular ones. I accept these fit nicely into the ears of a majority of passengers. But not all ears are the same and they just don’t fit mine at all. So even though this, with a weather delay, was only a 4-hour flight, watching anything on the IFE was out of the question.

### "I never use again"
This is first time I use China Airlines, also this is the last time. I never use again and will recommend other people don’t use this China Airlines. This aircraft is small and old. The F&B is not good, very bad. The staff is not helpful. They don’t support the passengers. I needed to change the middle seat to aisle seat, but they ask me for charging money. I didn’t request change to another higher class seat, just same economy. When I get aboard, I saw 4 empty seat around me.

### "an inconsistent experience"
Los Angeles to Denpasar via Taipei. Check-in at LAX was smooth. They gave us a transfer sleeve to store boarding passes for later segment, which was a nice touch. We had a remote gate far away and had to be shuttled by bus. That experience wasn't very pleasant as we had to wait inside the bus for a very long time. Despite having reservation for four seats (traveling as a family), there was no available overhead storage. All four of us had requested special meals, but the flight attendants started serving us regular meal. It was only after we showed them our boarding passes that they served our special meals. The overall ambiance, seating comfort, and IFE were excellent. Both B777-300ER and A330-300 were tastefully decorated. The service between Taipei and Bali segment was far superior to what we experience between LA and Taipei. The service on our final segment from TPE to LAX fell below the mark. The flight attendants serving us in economy didn't smile and were quite rude while interacting with us. So, while friendly service was absent in TPE-LAX segment, the WiFi worked well on B777-300ER. Overall, China Airlines offered an inconsistent experience where the positives outweighed the negatives, so we will still fly with them again.

### "appreciated our luggage arriving with us"
Taipei to Sanya. Our plane was late getting into Taipei from Los Angeles and we had just enough time to disembark and walk to the gate of our connecting flight to be the last persons to board. I told my wife that I was sure our luggage wasn’t going to make the connection. I sat down at my window seat and watched the last of the luggage being loaded but did not see ours. The cabin door closed and I expected us to leave but we didn’t. I could see the baggage handlers impatiently waiting for something. Alas, 10 minutes later a buggy showed up with our luggage and was quickly loaded and we were then on our way. Our flight ended up late and although I felt a little guilty we really appreciated our luggage arriving with us. The food we just ok. The staff were friendly but busy.

### "most comfortable seats"
Taipei to Vienna. I find the service in Business Class worth the money. The friendliness and readiness to serve you is very good. The seat is one of the most comfortable seats in business class. The food, especially the breakfast, is very good and tasty, champagne and wine was excellent as well. IFE offers you a large screen and is very responsive. The variety to choose from was also more than enough.

### "worst flight I've ever been on"
New York to Taipei. This is the worst flight I've ever been on in my life. I got a discount on this flight, and the stewardesses were nice. Everything else about was a nightmare. I called a week in advance and had to pay for the desired seat I wanted for $30 extra because this airline doesn't let you choose your seat. But they ended up giving me the wrong seat anyway, rather than 40E, which is larger. They could not fix the issue on the plane, so I was stuck with the tiny seat and wasted my $30. Some seats can lift the armrest, but the one I had to go to could not and was quite uncomfortable. I then learned that this was the first flight I've been on that doesn't offer free WiFi. I had to pay $50 (specifically $43.90) to use their very bad WiFi service. The "entertainment" tablet doesn't work, even if you rub it or clean it, and there's nothing on there you've ever heard of, anyway. The food looked inedible, but that's okay because I opted not to eat anyway. It just sucks you have to pay for water, since TSA obviously doesn't let you bring any liquids on. Guess I should've brought a bigger water bottle. Sixteen hours of this, and they don't even offer you WiFi or working power outlets (though I'm surprised we even had those). This airline just seems cheap, even if their actual prices aren't that cheap.

### "special meal of a good quality"
Tokyo to Taipei. Priority check-in at Narita was quick and easy. I was able to change my seat at the counter. Boeing 777 has a beautifully designed cabin and offers lots of choices on the inflight entertainment system. The cabin manager on this flight was  kind and helpful. I was welcomed on board and addressed by name. The vegetarian special meal was of a good quality. There was a selection of drinks available, I tried Kumquat Lemonade and Formosa green tea. On arrival, my luggage was first off the belt as it was marked Priority. I am a SkyTeam Elite Plus member and I never experienced such attention to detail and personal service.

### "crew need to lift their game"
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew to Brisbane from Auckland and return. A350  was roomy and comfortable in Economy Class. Crew were friendly. IFE with a good selection of movies, TV and music. Crew on return flight indifferent and sour. Meals were awful - spiced chicken and rice - worse than a microwavable meal from the supermarket. In summary crew need to lift their game. English is often poor and engagement nowhere near Singapore Airlines.

### "mostly pleasantly surprised"
Bangkok to Honolulu via Taipei. I fly regularly between Honolulu and Bangkok, but I've never flown on China Airlines. However, it emerged as the least-expensive option for a recent trip and since the price and flight schedules were good I decided to give the airline a try, despite some hesitation. I was mostly pleasantly surprised by the airline: Though the staff seem to be unable to smile and service both on the ground and in the air is bare-bones, the A350 is a fabulous aircraft, the seats were mostly comfortable, and the entertainment system was alright. There were a few negative experiences: For instance, not one single flight arrived or departed on time; The airline's pillows and blankets are pitiful, and the catering is mostly inedible; China Airlines has the serving style favored by many Asian airlines, wherein a few drinks choices are offered on top of the meal service trolleys, and if a passenger requests anything not on top of the trolley, the flight attendants tend to lie and say they ran out. It's very, very tedious to constantly have to ask and remind them for something as simple as a can of Coke Zero, and for it to be brought with a scowl. I arrived at Taipei from Honolulu in the middle Typhoon Mitag; My onward flight to Bangkok that evening was cancelled and I was expecting a chaotic, uncomfortable evening in Taipei's airport. Much to my surprise, the situation had been rather expertly arranged before my arrival: An agent met our flight and informed all of us going to Bangkok that we had been rescheduled for a flight the following morning and that accommodation had been arranged for us for that evening. I was impressed by the efficiency of China Airlines and the Taipei airport authorities, and I commend them for their handling of a difficult situation. In all, I recommend China Airlines because of the very low cost paid for this set of flights. While China Airlines certainly pales in comparison to ANA, JAL, EVA Air, Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines, it is at least as good as Korean Air.

### "not fly with this airline again"
Taipei to Vancouver. The onboard experience was fine. The problem with this airline is the ground customer service and code-share system. I have no idea why, but China Airlines would not allow me to select my seats in advance or even change my seats at check-in. It seems that some tickets simply do not have an online check-in or seat selection option. You are forced to get to the check-in desk when it opens (about 3hrs before a flight) and try to get them to change the seat they assign to you. This creates a mad rush at check-in, and a strong likely-hood of not sitting with your companion and getting the middle seat. This is exactly what happened to me in Taipei. I flew in on a code-share flight with Vietnam Airlines. There was no online check-in option for the China Airlines portion of the flight. At check-in in Saigon, China Airlines automatically assigned my wife and me to two middle seats in different rows (not together). I asked the Vietnam Airlines agent if we could change the seat assignments, but they were unable to access seating for China Airlines. When I got to Taipei for the connection, I went to the China Airlines office to change the seats, and they said all seats were assigned and the flight was full, but that the boarding counter could probably do something. I went to the boarding gate, and they said they would make a note of this. I asked what that meant, and they said they would tell the stewardess. I asked what that meant, and they said the stewardess would look for spare seats. I asked why they couldn't see if there were any spare seats, and the boarding gate said they could, and there were none, 'but maybe someone would be too sick to fly'. There was no attempt to look for people that were willing to move from one seat to another to accommodate my wife and I sitting together. No effort what so ever, they just wanted to tell me they took my name. The boarding agents said it was a common problem that people could not check-in online or select their seats in advance. The boarding agents even laughed as I walked away. The problem is not just the boarding agents, its China Airlines inability to allow online check-in or seat selection on booking flights. I'm not sure why they don't have a system that would do this? Regardless, I will not fly with this airline again.

### "service was very good"
Vienna to Auckland via Taipei and Brisbane. I am very happy with the experience . I flew in Economy Class, at the height of 1,83m / 6ft I had enough legroom. Vienna to Taipei I was offered to change my original seat to a seat in a row which was completely free (I did manage to sleep a couple of hours on this flight as I could kind of lie down during the flight.) The remaining two flights were fully booked and if 3 men sit next to each other, there is not too much space in Economy class but it did not feel uncomfortable. The cabin crew was very friendly and the service was very good. I enjoyed the meals and the in-flight entertainment. The A350-900 is a great and modern airplane I can definitely recommend.

### "never fly with China airlines again"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Jakarta via Taipei. Will never fly with China airlines again, flight attendants are rude no common courtesy, get into your personal space without warning no "excuse me" no nothing! Felt like a harrasment because I purchased a premium economy seats for my infant and have to argue back and forth about it because they didn't believe my 1,5 year old is not 2 years old, I bought 3 premium economy seats for my 2 kids and I but they only gave me 2 meals and not counting my other kid! Their excuse is they don't have infant food even tho I told them my 1,5 year old can eat anything, asking me to show my kid passport all the time because they thought my 1,5 year old is too big for her age. Told me to deflate my flytot even tho other passengers in economy class are allowed to using theirs, even after I deflated it they keep coming back and woken me up because they thought I was still using it! I have to literally show them I didn't use the flytot anymore! Again I will never fly with China airlines ever again. The only reason I gave 2 stars for cabin service and not 1 star is because one of the flight attendant actually felt bad for keep asking me about my child. But out of 4 flights we've taken only 1 was bearable.

### "I enjoyed both flights"
Taipei to Beijing return. The inbound flight was delayed over one hour. The customer service in Beijing offered passengers snacks and soft drinks. Overall, the service was very nice. Seats are comfortable. I enjoyed both flights.

### "Would recommend for the price"
We flew Brisbane to London Gatwick via Taipei and return with China Airlines. We weren’t delayed on any of the flights there or back. Blankets, pillows were waiting for us when we boarded. On the longer legs (Taipei - Gatwick & Gatwick - Taipei) amenity kits were provided (we were in economy!) so that was a nice little extra. The seats were not comfortable at all which is a shame and the food was a little disappointing. The cabin service was alright. Would recommend for the price. They were the cheapest tickets at the time of booking.

### "lacks basic human courtesy"
China Airlines has the worst customer service and support. We booked a round trip from Singapore to Vancouver last week. Our flight got cancelled due to a typhoon in Taipei and we got to know of it just a day before we were suppose to fly. There was no way to reach out to the airlines - no helpline 24*7. It was a struggle to contact the airline and we wrote on their Facebook page on which they responded. They asked to wait and asked to visit the airport next day morning. Got there early morning and they blatantly said they can’t do anything! Flight is cancelled and no replacement to fly. We were told there is one flight which was on very short notice and we coudnt have possibly taken it! With no way out we booked another flight to do our trip paying a lot more extra. We reached Vancouver and were continuously getting messages from China Airlines for our return flight which made us comfortable that our outgoing flight is on! To our horror, we were stopped from boarding the flight! And then came in the China Airlines supervisor who broke some news to us which none bothered to convey till then by the airlines. First he said if you board the flight you can’t get refund for the incoming flight which we technically did use. Yes, we couldn't use because you cancelled the flight and did not give any backup flight to the helpless customer. None of the customer service people at the airport told us about the refund and cancellation in such scenarios. Zero communication. The supervisor blatantly asked to decide whether to board and forget the refund for one way or buy another ticket and take a full refund. We were aghast. This isn’t just a monetary situation but a big mental pressure for someone travelling with family. The airline showed no sympathy towards the child too. To convey the same we went to one of the representatives and they kinda looked lost had no idea and then directed us to someone else, laughing at out back. This is ridiculous and shows the airline lacks basic human courtesy! A little later the supervisor came and said That we can't board the flight altogether! Since the ticket stands null and void! None from the airlines conveyed us till now and instead we were getting all flight updates on messages. Is it a technical problem that your system shows customer wrong information and you the right information? We coudnt sleep looking for another pocket friendly Flight to go Home and hotel to stay. Who’s to be blamed? We may forget the financial loss but the mental agony China Airlines has caused is beyond words.

### "terrific value for money"
Frankfurt to Brisbane via Taipei. Extremely good experience! Firstly terrific value for money as this similar trip with Turkish Airlines or Singapore Airlines was going to cost over double the price of China Airlines! Ground staff were helpful and efficient, lounge in Taipei was great and cabin crew service was friendly yet not overbearing. The food on all sectors was terrific with plenty of variety in the meals across all 4 sectors - I always chose to eat rather than sleep since I didn't want to miss the meal! Seats are very comfortable and happily got all the sleep I could. Both the B777 and A350 were enjoyable although the A350 is the newer and better product. I was worried about my bags as I also had a flight before Frankfurt but both bags happily made it through all 6 flights without being lost or damaged. Only negatives are that the entertainment system is a bit limited with about 50% of the movies in English with few of them particularly recent and the selection is poorly organised, especially compared to someone like Emirates, but in Business Class it was easy to sleep rather than watch a movie - this would be a bigger problem in Economy where it's harder to get good sleep. Also their flight schedule can lead to some long transit layovers in Taipei and they make too many announcements in the lounge, which was especially unnecessary when a small delay of 20 minutes on my flight was communicated to me via text, email and a lounge attendant even came and found me personally to let me know! So many announcements affected the atmosphere a bit and made it hard to rest. Definitely recommended with a terrific value for money in Business Class and a great product and service.

### "flight times changed at least 5 times"
I booked round-trip flight from LAX to Bangkok via Taipei for January 2020. Since the time I booked the flight 5 months ago, the flight times were changed at least 5 times. The latest arrival time is much later than the original arrival time which created a problem for my plans. I cancelled the fight but was charged $200 cancellation fee ($100 for each person in the booking). Since my cancellation was due to China Airline’s change of schedule, the $200 cancellation fee should be waived. But China Airline refused to refund.

### "A350 is a great plane"
Denpasar to Rome via Taipei. The first leg on our return journey (DPS-TPE) was by an old 747- 400: the aircraft was pretty rundown, with a bad smell and very narrow seats; the old IFE didn't work properly and FA tried to reboot the system multiple times but my personal screen didn't work properly. Food average. The second leg (TPE-FCO) was a different story: the A350 is a great plane : plenty of space, great IFE and I could stretch my legs and sleep almost the whole flight, wonderful mood lights and smiling FA made this 13 hours journey very pleasant.

### "would recommend China Airlines"
Melbourne to Bangkok via Taipei return. All 4 flights  were nothing short of exemplary, operated by an A350, which is much quieter and noticeably reduces jet lag. The crew on all my flights were friendly, professional and very safety conscious. Meal service was prompt and with a smile, and the crew were polite and friendly. I ordered several drinks and requested a toothbrush and an adapter and all were delivered quickly. They passed out hot towels for economy class passengers which is a much-appreciated gesture. During the overnight flight staff often passed through the cabin with water and juice, and kept the toilets clean. My flight back to Melbourne was delayed by 8 hours and we were provided accommodation at the Novotel near Taipei airport and they organised a shuttle bus to take us back to the airport in the morning, I found the ground staff at Taipei airport to be friendly and customer focused. The onboard entertainment system is easy to navigate and had many new releases and TV shows to choose from. The only aspect that could be improved is their food options, I found most of my meals to be lacking flavor, however they did offer an ice cream bar and a bread roll with all meals. Staff offer a selection of juice soft drinks, wine and coffee/Chinese tea with the meal service. I would not hesitate to fly with them again, in fact I found their service to be superior to Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines and would recommend China Airlines without hesitation.

### "there is good legroom space"
Taipei to Vancouver. Relatively new A350 with comfortable seats and nice 11" IFE screen with USB and power outlet. The back seat design lacks enough forethought in not making available slots for tablets and mobile phones and a hook for small items to hang. Having said that there is good legroom space. The entertainment choice is still limited. The flight crew service was better than the ICN-TPE leg but they lack the courteousness that other Asian airlines are known for. One example, one flight attendant told a passenger to bring the seat back upright for a meal. She was quite rude and abrupt. For a Chinese her manner would have been viewed as a typical request, but as a flight attendant serving passengers of various nationalities, that would not be acceptable. She looked as if she was one of the more senior member of the flight crew. The food was still below average and the flight attendants were once again rushing through the meal service offering coffee and tea even though passengers had not finished the main meal. Overall, they lack the expected attention to detail and professionalism to compete effectively with other airlines. The excellent hardware, ie. the plane, is let down by the subpar flight crew service.

### "lacks polish and professionalism"
Seoul Incheon to Taipei. The flight crew lacks the polish and professionalism of some airlines. The meal service was rushed with coffee and tea being offered even before most could finish the meal and in a rushed manner that if you were not paying attention you would have missed them. The IFE is an old outdated 6.5" touch screen that is due for an update with relatively limited choice of entertainment. The pillows and blankets were not separately packaged raising questions of possible sanitation. The food quality is below average. One thing that is going for China Airlines is their fare which tends to be cheaper than others.

### "bad experience in my baggage"
Manila to Vancouver via Taipei. My overall experience is okay. Needs further improvement on the audio. Also, the food should be improved, aesthetically and by flavor. Our taste buds aren’t much functional when in high altitude, so it is a must that aroma and flavor of the food compliments each other, or else, all of the food will just taste all pretty much the same. I had a bad experience in my baggage when the ground steward in Manila told me that my baggage will go straight to Saskatoon (my final destination), and not to be picked up in Vancouver. Since I was a new flyer, I didn’t know much of this. I even clarified (twice) with the steward if I will be picking it up in Saskatoon or Vancouver, and he kept on saying that it’s gonna be in Saskatoon. But when I arrived in Saskatoon, my baggage wasn’t there. So much inconvenience on my part. They need to have well-trained and knowledgeable staff when it comes to these types of situation, or a mentor should be around in this case. With this, I don’t know if I will fly with China Airlines anymore.

### "always ask you to show the credit card"
Not Verified |  Taipei to San Francisco. Overall experience is fine. The worst part is at the check-in counter they always ask you to show the credit card used for purchasing the ticket. When I purchased tickets for my kids and they travel alone, they almost got stranded at the airport and couldn’t get on the flight

### "Amazing cabin crew"
Frankfurt to Hanoi via Taipei. Amazing cabin crew. They are professional, caring and nice. Updated in-flight entertainment programme. Food is fairly good. They serve ice-cream for lunch.

### "a decent Business Class"
Melbourne to Osaka via Taipei, returning from Sapporo. Overall China Airlines offers a decent Business Class at a reasonable fare. Both check-in processes were efficient and friendly. The lounges in Melbourne, Taipei and Sapporo were comfortable without being luxurious - good spaces to relax, with pleasant food and drink options. On board, the seats turned into nice lie-flat beds, the main downside being a lack of storage space around the seats. The crews were hardworking, polite and generally friendly. Only soft drinks were offered as a welcome, but there was a reasonable wine and spirits list. My vegetarian meals were fine but not adventurous. No amenities kits were provided, and there were no toothbrushes/paste provided in the toilets -- a sign of some cutting of corners in this product. Three flights operated punctually, one was delayed 30 minutes due to "ground handling issues". Taipei is quite an easy transfer point, with good signage and friendly staff.

### "nicest business class cabin"
Brisbane to Taipei. Originally I was booked on EVA Air, but about a week before my flight in late June 2019 they went on strike with a number of flights cancelled and I was changed to this flight about a week before my departure. EVA operates an A330 with 2-2-2 in business class on this route but China Airlines operates an A350-900 with a 1-2-1 and what a stunning cabin this is probably the nicest business class cabin I have travelled. With a late departure around 2250 from Brisbane and an arrival into Taipei at 0545 the next morning with just under 9 hours in the air the quick meal service on departure was well organized and excellent quality which left a reasonable amount of time for some sleep before breakfast before arrival in Taipei. The seat on this plane is fantastic with plenty of storage a great screen and a very sturdy table that pulls out from under the screen and always have a little part exposed so is always a handy shelf at anytime. The finishes that they have used seem to be of a really high quality with my 16 month old plane looking like it was on its first flight. No pyjamas are provided but slippers and a nice amenity kit are.

### "food was very boring"
Sydney to London via Taipei. The walking aisle was no bigger than for 1 person (like planes in short flights), therefore it was not possible to stretch your legs, and in the flight London - Sydney you really need it. I would not recommend this company for more than 4 hr flight max. The food was very boring, pretty much all the same - rice with something. I was woken up by staff in the middle of the flight and ask to move to my original seat even I was already there, I showed my ticked, however the staff didn't apologise me. Very upsetting when it is very hard to fall in sleep in the very uncomfortable flight, but instead of enjoying it you been woken up.

### "comfortable and quiet"
Delhi to Taipei. Service excellent and staff were professional. Food was far better than expected. The plane was very comfortable and quiet. After 8 hours plus of travel arrived to Taipei Flights seem to go quick.

### "Fare unbeatable"
Service excellent, all staff were professional. Food was far better than expected. The A350 was very comfortable and quiet. After 24 hours plus of travel arrived into Gatwick with no aches and pains. Flights seem to go quick. Leg room excellent. Only thing missing was the camera. Previously flown China Airlines from Syd to Akl and on the A330 they had the nose camera and the kids loved seeing take off and landing. The A350 does not have this. The camera is a very minor point as the IFE made up for this. System very quick and did not cause any issues. Good selection of movies and TV shows. Fare unbeatable.

### " Unbelievably horrible"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Manila via Taipei. Unbelievably horrible! Flight for my brother was May 1st. It's now the 7th and my brother still doesn't have his luggage! He can't buy clothes his size in the Philippines. I spent 7 hours and $200 in international calls trying to track down his lost luggage. His luggage "may" show up in Manila tomorrow - seriously? Worst customer service.

### "cabin service was good"
Overall an excellent Business Class product on the A350, the seat offers privacy and comfort with an easy to operate inflight entertainment system. The negatives I found were that the blanket provided was too thin and the seven hour wait for the connecting flight on the return journey out of Taipei too long. The cabin service was good, particularly Taipei to London where the service was faultless. I will definitely look to use the airline again in the future.

### "The seat the best"
Taipei to Honolulu. A wonderful experience. The seat the best, cabin staff warm and efficient, the entertainment good enough. Food presentation is wonderful, an appealing service. The food itself needs refining, lightening in terms of sauces etc but that is minor. I highly recommend the business class.

### "extremely bad experience"
Hong Kong to Taipei. I had an extremely bad experience with China Airlines, and request some answers from them. We bought tickets mid February for return tickets : Hong Kong – Taiwan (flight CI 922). At check-in, the morning of the flight, the staff simply told us that we couldn’t take our flight. Besides generating a huge frustration feeling before our holidays even start, the fact that she didn’t propose any solution or even look for solution is simply astonishing. So the reason she gave us is that our names on the booking didn’t match our passports. To be precise, our First Name was correct, and our Family Name was also correct. BUT, she told me that we had to put all our middle names as well with our First Names. Apparently, this is a change in the policy that was pushed before, but she was not able to tell us how recently. And as we did not put our middle names, our tickets were unusable, we couldn’t take the plane. Everything else was correct : passport number, dates, etc. No solution proposed, no real help, nothing… Oh wait, actually yes, she proposed us a solution : buy new tickets, obviously ! In my country, the middle names are absolutely never used. Moreover, every time I didn’t put our middle names in the booking, all the companies let us go on the plane. But China Airlines only decided not to. So I tried to find a solution, any action we could do to amend it. Of course, modifying the booking online by myself was prohibited by China Airlines website. I went back on the website to check the display of the booking page, and where this rule is written. So actually there is now a mention in brackets to put middle names (which I don’t remember to see last time, anyway). However, there are only 2 boxes called “Last Name” and “First Name”. If you require middle names too, add a dedicated box, it is clearer. On top of that, my first name contains an hyphen, but the website does not accept it. Moreover, I have commas between my middle names, but as the website does not accept special characters neither, how to input them ? Finally, where there is a change in policy, you should make it more obvious ! The technical limitations of the website make everything even more confusing. So at the counter I asked her to amend our booking; not possible neither. How come ? ? Wait, actually, yes, she could modify the booking, but ONLY 3 LETTERS… What ? yes, 3 letters. So she managed to amend our son’s booking as the middle name was only 3 letters long (of course, with a fee), but not ours… What of a rule is this ? So actually, China Airlines CAN amend booking. Technically and regulatory, it is possible(I presume China airlines will use some kind of dark regulation to explain that only 3 letters can be changed for security purposes…) They just didn’t for us. So we finally bought new tickets, with fees, more expensive of course. I made reimbursement request for the old ones, and of course, no answer yet. And I don’t expect any. Better have customers paying twice and not losing money, right China airlines ? At Taipei counter, I told China Airlines staff my story, and ask them if they could amend our names, they replied “yes it should be possible to amend”, “hum, I don’t understand why they told you that in Hong Kong, I am not sure why”.

### "Very comfortable product"
Taipei to Vancouver. Very comfortable product. Seat and food excellent, especially for a long total journey after transit in TPE. Service attentive but not over the top. Drinks a little limited but pleasant enough. Inflight WiFi fast and TPE lounge generally comfortable too although did start to get a bit crowded.

### "the worst airline ever"
Bangkok to Honolulu via Taipei. This is the worst airline ever. They have cancelled our flight from April 5th to April 3rd and our return trip from April 19th to April 21st, which caused us a lot of trouble to change our itinerary and we had to cancel our business deal with our customers. Their are 4 of us and they split our seating and 4 of us have to sit separate of each other.

### "Awful customer service"
Awful customer service! I purchased a 2-segments tickets through China Airline website. The 2nd segment (New York to Boston) was carried by JetBlue. When I contacted China Airlines to get refund for the 2nd segment, they told me that JetBlue did something to the ticket so they can't process the ticket in their system right now. I asked China Airlines to talk directly to JetBlue, but they wouldn't do it. They kept asking me to translate their issues for them although I don't even know some of the terminology used. And each time when I called back to China Airlines, I got connected to a different rep so I had to repeat my story and tell the 2nd rep about what the first rep told me and what JetBlue told me. These went on for 4 rounds. Each round, I had to explain more, why there need to be a refund, what the 1st rep said, what JetBlue replied, what the 2nd rep said, etc. It is an unbelievably bad customer service. Finally, somehow they were able to process it and told me they'd contact me about the refund. Few days later, I got an email from China airline telling me that yes, they could refund me now, but I'll need to personally go to a China Airlines office, which is in a completely different state, far from the state I live to get this refund! I was very furious and replied by asking who would pay the airfare for me to fly to another state to get this refund in person and why couldn't they simply refund the money back to the credit card I used to purchased the tickets in the first place. At this moment, I have not gotten any reply about my email and have not seen the money deposited to my credit card either.

### "A350 was very comfortable"
Amsterdam to Seoul via Taipei. The flight in the A350 from Amsterdam to Taipei was very comfortable. Especially the food and inflight entertainment made a good impression. Wifi was available, however quite expensive. The second flight from TPE to ICN was in the Boeing 747-400. This plane felt quite old and the seats and inflight entertainment were obviously old.

### "service quality is going down"
Kaohsiung to Hong Kong. I checked in at the Kaohsiung airport today at the business class counter. Was greeted by two extremely rude desk staff! Completely surprised. In the past I have always had good experience it it seems service quality is going down. Strongly encourage others to avoid this airline till they get their act together. The flight itself was fine.

### "lounges are notoriously bleak"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Bangkok via Taipei. The seats on their 777-300 and A350 are excellent, wide and full lie-flat, and decent blanket. The seats are sturdy, so you can't feel movement by other passengers in neighboring seats getting up and down. Amenities are decent, and the cabin staff is attentive. Overall, though, this is at best a middling business-class product. Unlike other airlines, you don't get Champagne before departure, just a choice of apple juice, orange juice, or water. In-flight entertainment options are quite limited, with many movies and TV shows available only in Chinese. The food tends to be merely edible, and seldom appetizing or enjoyable. It's beyond me why they charge business class passengers for WiFi - there's nothing like paying upwards of $5000 for a single ticket, trying to log on to WiFi, and finding that you need to pay extra for WiFi access. As for ground service, China Airlines lounges are notoriously bleak. They're often quite crowded, and the food and beverage choices are ridiculously limited. (In Taipei, for example, they have 4-5 dim sum varieties on offer, some congee, and a couple of other Chinese offerings, such as a cabbage stir-fry dish. At the SFO lounge, the choices are vastly more limited. You'll get far better food outside in the terminal.) The functionality of the China Airlines website is primitive at best - I have yet to find out how to pull up my itinerary without trying to check in.

### "made this flight a memorable one"
Flight attendants on the NGO-TPE leg (A333) and TPE-NGO (B738) surely made this flight a memorable one. They were so attentive and despite being Taiwanese, their Japanese language skills were superb. TPE-KUL-TPE was just heaven. The decor on the B777-300ER was well thought out. The flight attendant on the KUL-TPE leg went beyond the norm of a normal FA. When I asked the brand of the Oolong tea served on the aircraft, she gladly gave me a tea bag of the one they serve on flight. My wife and I did an overnight at Taipei but I would definetely recommend and fly China Airlines again on my next trip to Southeast Asia.

### "an excellent experience"
Vienna to Palau via Taipei. It was an excellent experience. The service was consistent and cordial on all 4 legs of the trip. I find the business class seat very comfortable on the A350. The old school seat on the 737 is comfortable enough for the shorter flights. On my way back flying Palau to Taipeh I was the only passenger in C and the flight attendant did everything to keep my glass filled. Food was good and plenty, the entertainment was good with many choices. I tested the onboard WLan which was alright, but not really needed. The lounge in Taipeh was comfortable and the shower highly appreciated. On my final leg to Vienna a (minor) medical incident occured and they looked for medical personnel. Me and another MD attended the passenger. Afterwards the purser came personally to thank me and bowed to me. I felt very special being a customer of this airline!

### "consider China Airlines again"
San Francisco to Manila via Taipei. All 4 segments of our flights went relatively well, there were no hassles and the fare we paid was good especially since this was for Christmas peak season. The San Francisco-Taipei and Taipei-San Francisco flights both were excellent but the Taipei-Manila and Manila-Taipei were okay. SFO-TPE: Check-in was a breeze and there were no hassles with the luggage although we were slightly overweight by a fraction. The B777-300ER plane we flew looks fairly new. We got seats 71H & 71K - perfect for couples. Food was good, service was decent. There were lots of entertainment options, movies, etc. and monitor was huge and resolution was sharp. Toilet was clean and I was told flight crew periodically clean it/wipe it down, which was well appreciated. They exceeded my expectations. TPE-MNL: We had 1.5 hours of transit time but lines were very long through security. Aircraft was A330 with a 2-4-2 configuration. We loved the fact that we were seated on a pair of seats as we like to keep to ourselves. Service was decent, nothing exceptional. Food was okay. There were some entertainment options on board including movies but since this was a 2-hour flight, it was not enough to finish a complete movie. The aircraft was also older and the monitor was smaller and not as sharp than the B777-300ER. MNL-TPE: Same aircraft as TPE-MNL with similar experience. My only unfavorable comment was that restrooms weren't clean on this flight. Some passenger completely made a mess in the entire lavatory and it appears flight crew do not clean this, possibly because it was a very short flight. TPE-SFO: Similar comments as CI003 SFO-TPE. We were seated on 70H & 70K. We really loved the pair of seats in the back. Again, food and service were excellent. No transit issues as we purposely took the 11-hour layover to see the city. However, immigration line took 1.5 hours - not good. Otherwise, the experience was good. Overall we were very pleased with our experience. Flights were on time, products and services were good, luggage came as expected and there were no significant inconveniences/hassles. We would consider flying China Airlines again.

### "Very unfriendly on weight"
Hong Kong to Singapore via Taipei. Very unfriendly on weight for Business Class. We are first time travel on this Airline on Business Class which was recommended by Flight Center. We booked our Round the World all on Business Class, of course, a lot of shopping which resulted overweight for check in Luggage of 9 kg per person. Check in service insisted us to pay for the 9kg fees and later I had spoken to a friendly Supervisor but not much help. She manage to get us extra 1kg free only per person. We have no choice, open up luggage, throw away 8kg of stuff per person to made them happy but not us. We should have stick to our Singapore Kris Flyer may have avoided all these. China Airlines are too straight to Business Class, moreover, we are travelling Round the World.

### "negligence of airport staff"
Bangkok to Los Angeles connecting at Taipei, with Special Assistance of Wheel chair for me. After alighting from CI 832 at Taipei around 7:00 pm, I was asked to ride a fully packed cab with similar assisted passengers to the Transfer Area. I had a carry-on trolley bag with me, which personnel carelessly loaded on top of three folded wheelchairs. As the cab speeded on way my bag fell off the cab hitting the airport floor. I did complain to the accompanying staff and expressed my apprehension of the damage to its contents, and also showed them the visible external damage to the bag. Upon arriving at home in Anaheim, on opening the bag I found more than three pieces of the souvenirs had broken, as well as the bag had cracked. Not only I feel dismayed and heartbroken as the souvenirs are irreplaceable here, and the bag was almost new. Because of their fragility I had decided to hand carry the souvenirs instead of checking them as checked baggage. This is all due to sheer negligence of airport staff at Taipei.

### "legroom in economy generous"
Taipei to Sydney on one of their new A350s. Boarding at started a bit later than scheduled, but we departed pretty much on time. About half an hour after departure, dinner was served - I went for the pork selection which came with a lot of side dishes. Very filling and delicious! Early the next morning we were served breakfast; I chose an omelette which came with fruit and yoghurt. The breakfast was tasty, though not as good as dinner. Arrival in Sydney was slightly early thanks to a strong tailwind, so we had to wait about ten minutes for our gate to be vacated by another aircraft. The legroom in economy was generous. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful, and were quite fluent in English. The onboard mood lighting was really neat, though I wish they used had the different colours on in economy more just like in premium economy and premium business. It was my first time flying China Airlines and I won’t hesitate flying with them again.

### "Both flights were great"
We flew Sydney to San Francisco via Taipei. Both flights were great; cabin crew, service, food, seat design, usability, and comfort (almost as good as SIA's business class seat and better than Lufthansa's or United), cleanliness, and punctuality (both flights left on time and arrived early) were spot on. As a bonus, clearing immigration at SFO, reclaiming our bags, and getting our hire-car were painless. Touchdown at 17:47, on our way at 19:15. The same process took us well over 3 hours a few years ago. They lost points for the wi-fi (too unreliable to be of any use) and the Sydney and Taipei lounges (reasonable, but more functional than welcoming with okay but not great food). Overall almost as good as you could want and extremely good value compared to Qantas and United Airlines direct SYD/SFO flights, though it does take longer obviously. But now we have an excuse to stop off on in Taipei on the way back to sample the dumplings.

### "they were quite cheap"
Bangkok to Fukuoka via Taipei. I booked China airlines as they were quite cheap. Check in was quick for the flight from Bangkok to Taipei, and this flight was 25% full, so everyone spread out and was comfortably seated. Boarding was smooth. I changed to an exit row after the doors closed, so no complaints on legroom. Seats were quite plush. This was a newer A330 and the seat had a touchscreen TV, USB charging point and a shared power outlet. Food on most of the flights were of good quality, although I went for the less appealing option half the time! The flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Service was relatively quick. On the flight to Fukuoka, we had a 45 minute connection, and walking distances can be quite long through Taipei Airport, so we were some of the last passengers to board. This flight used a 737 Sky Interior, which I must say has the worst bathroom. This aircraft did not come with personal TVs but it's understandable as the flight lasted less than two hours. On the return flight, I flew from Osaka on their 777-300ER. On this flight, Premium economy was sold as standard economy, so I jumped at the opportunity and managed to get front-row seats for me and my mum. The premium economy seats look fantastic, have plenty of privacy, but I wouldn't choose them for a long haul transpacific flight. This is as the recline isn't too plenty and the hard backrest itself is a bit impractical. On flights to Japan, I highly recommend their Sapporo beer. It's the best can of beer I've had in the sky! On the flight to Bangkok, it was an older A330 this time and didn't feature power outlets or usb ports, and the seat recline was broken on many seats, so it would recline or not stay reclined at some points on the flight. To sum up, China Airlines isn't a bad choice.

### "avoid traveling China Airlines again"
Vancouver to Delhi via Taipei. My flight from Vancouver to Taipei was smooth, the service was good though the food in Business Class was just ok. A350 is a good aircraft. However, the plane on Taipei-Delhi route was old and the seats were not that comfortable. Moreover, the lounge at Taipei was undergoing some renovations and there was a notice to contact ground staff for a voucher. The ground staff was not available in that part of the terminal and showed up 45 minutes before departure. On both my inbound and outbound travels, they had no idea about any such offer nor did they offer anything or apologize for not being able to provide lounge to business class traveler. For that reason alone, I will avoid traveling with China Airlines again.

### "book another airline"
Brisbane to Auckland. Our flight was supposed to depart at 1pm. We sat on the plane until 2:30pm with absolutely no information or notification that the flight was delayed. Once they finally decided to announce the delay, we were told it would be another 2 hours minimum as “the plane needed to be inspected.” We were not allowed to get off the plane and no reimbursement was offered. So we are sitting in the plane 3 hours after “scheduled departure time” with 0 notice, reimbursement or options. Because the flight was delayed so long, by the time we arrived in Auckland it was too late to check into our accommodation, which was $198 wasted. When we brought this up to the staff they act like they have no idea how such a thing could happen. Do yourself a favor, pay the little extra and book another airline to avoid the holiday nightmare that 150+ of us all experiences on this joke of an airline.

### "an absolute disgrace"
Bangkok to Taipei. After a pleasant flight, this was the worst arrival I have experienced after millions of miles of travel. The flight arrived at the terminal just a few minutes late. There had been the usual pre-landing announcements but these were totally inaudible as the purser clearly had never checked the volume. Deplaning there was one China Airlines employee at the gate with a sign directing onward passengers to Fukuoka. This was gate D2 at the end of the terminal, and so it was a long walk to get to Immigration at the other end. Since I have a frequent visitors pass it took less than a minute to get through the formalities and I expected to get my bag and be on the way to my hotel within 30 minutes at most and just missing the start of the evening rush hour traffic. The wait for bags from BKK was interminable. I know Taoyuan can be busy, but after 40 minutes I had had enough. I walked the length of the baggage hall to the CI office. There I was told I was in the wrong terminal! This was totally unbelievable! I then had to walk upstairs, reverse the Immigration process and somehow find the route to Terminal 1. Once there, I was told the Immigration officer at Terminal 2 after voiding my arrival stamp should have returned my entry form which he failed to do. So there was a lot of phoning after which another form had to be completed. By the time I finally got to the the baggage hall, the carousel had stopped and my bag was the only one there. This whole nonsensical process had taken 90 minutes by which time I should have been in my hotel room. The Immigration staff at Taoyuan were efficient and only doing their duty. But for CI to have a flight arrive at the wrong terminal and then fail to ensure that every departing passenger was perfectly aware not only that they had to proceed to a different terminal but that each was directed very clearly to that terminal is an absolute disgrace. I will stick with TG and Eva for this route in future.

### "so rushed and irresponsible"
Taipei to Ontario. They started the pre-landing safety check 7 minutes prior to the arrival time. No one checked the entire row of overhead bin above. The cabin crew finally finished the random safety check 2 minutes prior to landing. It was a long haul flight so I don't get why they pushed it to the last couple minutes and did it so rushed and irresponsible. I am thinking about flying with Eva air next time. At least Eva pays a lot more attention to safety issues.

### "really has a lot to improve"
Ontario to Taipei. China Airlines has a lot to improve. The boarding is the slowest I've ever seen. They just kept pausing the boarding. The cabin looks super nice on its official website yet it was actually not as impressive or comfortable. The seat was the crampest I've ever seen on a long haul flight, I kept moving my back cause it was really uncomfortable. The yellow blanket looks super used. As for the food, again, the worst I've ever seen on a long haul flight. Often I don't expect any nice meal on a coach class, but China Airlines really went too far. You don't even get a dessert like cake, only two side dishes. And the salad was a mess. You should not expect much for the snack in between the meals when flying economy class as well, but saltine crackers, what a joke. The restroom was kind of dirty. EVA, ANA, or Asiana all kept their restroom clean so I don't get why can't China Airlines keeps it at least not dirty. The service was okay, they are neither attentive nor rude. One last thing, just when we arrived at 5, I waited for my checked luggage till 6:30. The bottom line is you China airlines really has a lot to improve.

### "I will never fly them again"
Sydney to Amsterdam via Taipei. Don't fly this airline from Australia / North America through Taipei to Europe. Booked a Premium Economy flight from SYD to AMS for a personal trip. Premium Economy looked very good on their A350s. Only a week after booking they cancelled the SYD to TPE flight on the way out which when challenged, they suggested leaving earlier and having an 18 hour stop in TPE. I got them to book me a hotel, some meals and as the hotel was only for 12 hours, business class lounge access for the final wait, which took a fair bit of persuasion. Then a month before departure they cancelled the return TPE to SYD leg and caused me to stay yet again another 18 hours in TPE. At this point I had had enough but was too close to departure to try and find another Prem Econ ticket anywhere near the price. I tried to persuade them to upgrade me to Business so I could sleep properly, as I was now arriving on a workday and had to go straight to work. They just refused, even though the ticket price difference was 550 Euros, if I was to compare a fresh single ticket Business versus Economy. So they had to book the hotel and meals but this time refused point blank access to the Business Class lounge on the basis they don't run their own lounges in their main hub. Unfortunately, as a non-EU Carrier, they are only liable for delays on flights leaving the EU, so only 1 of the 2 delays was covered, although they are trying to ignore their responsibility at the moment. The planes are nice. The Premium Economy Seat is very big, and when you first sit down, with loads of leg room. However, to recline it, the seat goes forward - a lot! So much so that (and I am not tall, only 1.78m) you cannot fit your feet under the seat in front, so unless you are very short, the complete recline is useless. The food in Premium, unlike most other airlines, is pure Economy, and to be honest even more unappetizing than standard airline food. Their onboard service is questionable to say the least, even in Premium. For example, on 3 out of the 4 flights, they only produced a pre-dinner bar car once, and you had to keep asking for drinks, which might finally arrive. The inflight entertainment is pretty basic unless you are Chinese, luckily, I had a load of Netflix downloaded. All in all, I will never fly them again, and would suggest anyone tempted by decent pricing on tickets, particularly in premium classes, be very careful if flying long haul through Taipei (from Australasia, North America etc) - if the flights are not full, they will drop them and you will be stuck in TPE. Customer focussed - not on your life!

### "last time taking China Airlines"
New York JFK to Yangon via Taipei. I have flied so many times with different airlines from JFK to Yangon. But this is the worst experience ever. All my baggage are left at the transit. I can understand that that’s because of short transit hour and the airlines told me that’s normal for them. The problem is that I requested the wheel chair and no one picked me up at the transit. This is seriously ridiculous. I was awaiting the wheel chair until the last 5 minutes to the next airplane. This must be my last time taking China Airlines.

### "would fly China Airlines again"
Amsterdam to Taipei. I had booked through KLM (who partner with China Airlines) and I had trouble to access my booking via China Airlines and therefore could not select my seat, which I found rather disappointing. This shouldn't be difficult to get right. The flight itself was very good. A  new plane with comfortable seats. Good leg space. Very attentive cabin crew. A lot of choice of movies and TV in the entertainment system. The food was good, although there was no hot chocolate, in lieu of coffee. An overnight bag with blanket, toothbrush and slippers was provided (which unfortunately is not standard anymore on long haul flights). All in all I would fly with China Airlines again, although I hope they improve the booking and check in process.

### "not fly China Airlines anymore"
Jakarta to Taipei. The flight was supposed to depart at 14:10 from Jakarta to Taipei, but it was delayed for 1 hour 40 minutes due to technical problem. No reconciliation provided by the airline for this delay to the passengers. Our first time to fly China Airlines, and disappointing. They shall not fly problematic aircraft unless that is all they can afford. Will not fly China Airlines anymore.

### " Seats were excellent"
Not Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. It was a new A350 plane, with a herringbone business class seat arrangement, meaning that everyone had a private, yet aisle seat. Seats were excellent, fully flat with convenient pockets to store things and wider than some others. The table for meals or laptops etc was very stored under the TV screen, and deployed directly towards the passenger, rather than swivelling out, which is a great improvement on other business class table layouts. The slippers and personal vanity bag contain nothing worth taking off the plane. Service was somewhat functional rather than engaging but a lot of the crew had little English. They were kind and helpful but not very interactive. Food was okay and substantial, but not exceptional. China Airlines seem to be able to leave and arrive at airports on time. All in all a great business class outcome if you aren't fussed about the food and service but want a great seat and on time delivery. The Taipei lounge is good also. Comfortable seats and food and drink on tap and a kitchen doing Chinese dishes on demand.

### "friendly and helpful"
Taipei to Gatwick. Really impressive service and comfort. I’m a tall person and still had plenty of leg room. The staff are friendly and helpful and attentive. If you are English speaking you may struggle a little as the airline is very Chinese focused. So language could be a problem. Not a big problem but have patience and humor. The airport at Tai[ei is fantastic. We were in transit both ways. The transit area is bright and spacious. For me and my wife, we had no problems. I’d happily go again, as soon as I’m over the jet lag. The food was excellent I must say.

### "the flight is canceled"
Vancouver to Taipei. Flight original schedule to depart at 2:20 am and due to mechanic failure, it was announced to delayed to 5:00am. At 5am on Aug 5, it was announced, it will further delay to 8:00am. At, 8:30am, China airlines announce they can not fix the problem and the flight is canceled. 5 hours of delay and only CAD$15 meal voucher provided. After 8:30am, I was arranged another flight in the next day 2:20 am. After that, no meal, no accommodations, no transportation, is arranged. Ground staff orally mention the compensation will be done while landing in Taipei. but it never happen. Complaint in Taiwan China Airline office. No compensation and verbally apology.

### "last flight was a disaster"
Vancouver to Taipei. I have flown this airline several times and normally had good service but my last flight was a disaster. We were scheduled to leave Vancouver at 2:20 am. After no notifications the flight was delayed for one hour. At 4 am we were told it was now delayed until 8 am. After trying to sleep for a few hours on benches or the floor at 8:30 we were told the flight was cancelled. This was just the beginning. After going through customs and immigration (we never left the country?) We got back to the checkin counters and formed an enormous queue of approximately 300. They had 3-4 ground staff to attempt to rebook all of us on other flights as they were not sure that the aircraft would be ready to fly the next morning. Complete chaos ensued. There was virtually no communication between CA staff and passengers. Finally around 5:50 pm the last of us were confirmed on flights the following day. They begrudgingly gave a few dozen passengers hotel rooms with no food allowance. I lost 2 days in Manila, my final destination and was not offered any compensation for my prepaid hotel room. Overall a terrible beginning to a trip.

### "comfortable and painless"
Taipei to Vancouver. I was impressed with the comfort and service. The staff was very friendly, they were prompt with meal time and very accommodating. The take off and landing were quite smooth, and I was happy with how painless the boarding was. The food was pretty good, with enough in the meal to fill me up for hours. For economy class the seats were decently comfortable, and the leg room was more than I was expecting. I loved the touch screens and the quantity of movie choices. My overall experience was as comfortable and painless as a flight can be. I would recommend this airline to anyone looking to take a lengthy flight.

### "food and service average"
Not Verified |  Christchurch to Auckland. Have previously flown with this airline in Business Class and could not fault it. We flew Premium Economy this time and were very disappointed. The seats are very comfortable and lots of movies to choose from, but the food and service were average. We had flown from Brisbane to Auckland three days earlier and were fed Fried Rice - no other choice(s) that was it! Coming back it was chicken with mushrooms, rice and vegetables. It was OK, but under seasoned and very bland. My husband cannot eat mushrooms and he eats hardly any vegetables. When he advised the hostess of this she came back with a serve of garlic bread from Business Class. That was his meal! He has a healthy appetite and was not impressed. I would point out that the same meals were being service to Economy Class, so not effort made to provide something a little bit better in Premium Economy. Drinks service limited - one with your meal, and another one just after. That was it. I do not think they were ever offering spirits. They also did not come round offering water on a regular basis, as most airlines. Will definitely go Business Class next time - I do recommend that.

### "offers a great product"
Brisbane to London return. Both flights the air crew and ground staff were great. Food was pretty good both trips, and enough choices for entertainment, including a number of recent movies, although would be pressed to have enough movies to do two London trips in the same month. At the price point I think China Airways offers a great product and Taipei airport is big enough to happily spend time during transit. Point to note duty free shopping is not a bargain.

### "staff were polite and helpful"
Hong Kong to Taipei. Reasonable price, good service, the staff were polite and helpful. Really surprised that we would have a meal even for the short flight. The food is pretty delicious. However bigger portion would be better.

### "absolute worst experience"
Vancouver to Taipei. One of the worst experiences I have had boarding a gate. Prior to boarding the gate I was hassled over my returning ticket which I did have. The boarding staff of China airlines were terrible they were forcing me to purchase another ticket. On top of that I am being told they will not allow me to board the gate, they will close the gate on me and that I would be sent home. I was forced to purchase a ticket that I will not use and cannot be refunded on now. All of my friends who flew out to Bali did not have any of these issues or forced to purchase a ticket going home. The absolute worst experience.

### "put on an earlier flight"
Sydney to London via Taipei. Flight was originally on the 10th to London but rescheduled for the 11th because of a tropical storm heading towards Japan/Taiwan. I was upset because I was going to now miss the Semi final match between England and Croatia. I gave China airlines a ring was on hold for an hour (at this point I was ready to give up) and then was told at 10:15am that if I get to Sydney airport by 11am they would get me on an earlier flight and reach Taiwan before the storm does. So jumped in an Uber and was 5mins late. Thankfully I was put on an earlier flight as soon as I arrived!

### "Entertainment was very dated"
Taipei to Denpasar. After a substandard flight from LHR to Taipei via Amsterdam, I was transferred to Bali. The transfer process in Taipei airport isn’t as easy as other major hubs as it involved a lot of stairs and lifts and a very confusing layout. The CI lounge in T1 was very crowded and it didn’t feel like a hub lounge for a major airlines, and when the main lounge was crowded they sent passengers to a small lounge which felt like a classroom. Outward journey: we left Taipei ontime. Boarding was easy and smooth. To my disappointment it was an old A330 with very dated interior. The seating was comfortable for a 5 hour flight. Entertainment was again very dated. Unlike my experience with their long haul flight, shortfall flights with China Airlines seem to be a different class. All the crew members on this flight was very friendly and approachable, and they didn’t stop providing any food or drink throughout the flight. It was indeed one of the best flights I had in terms of services. Landed in Bali on time but it was a long wait for the luggage. Return journey: check in at Bali was very slow but the agents were all very friendly. Returning flight was a slightly newer plan (A330). Service was again better than most of the long haul flight but definitely not as good as the outbound journey. Arrival at Taipei was very efficient. Quick immigration check and luggage was out within few minutes.

### "not as good as EVA"
OK service, issue with the planes I travelled London Heathrow to Taipei (with onward journey to Bali) in June with China Airlines. It involved a stop over at Amsterdam and the flight between London and Amsterdam was on KLM, while AMS to TPE was on China Airlines. Outbound flight left Amsterdam on time and arrived at Taipei few minutes ahead of schedule. China Airlines use new A350 for its European routes with the exception of Frankfurt. Once I got onboard I immediately noticed that the seat control panel wasn’t working. As a result there were only three possible positions throughout the flight – sit up, relax or flat bed. The table lamp was also disable because of this. I reported to the crew but they didn’t do anything until almost landing. Service was pretty efficient but not particularly warm nor friendly. Returning lag was slightly better. The CI lounge in Taipei terminal 1 was very dark and crowded until late evening. It was renovated 2-3 years ago but has started to show some sign of poor maintenance. The food and drink provided is substandard. Boarding was late by circa 20 minutes but the process was very easy for business class passengers. I was greeted by name by the cabin manager and the team which doesn’t always happen on CI long haul flights. Some of the crew members on this flight were exceptional. However I experienced problem again with the hardware. One of the toilets was out of order which means there was only one toilet for the business class cabin; the window shed in seat 14K was also broken. Seems to me that CI has a lot of maintenance issues. Overall it was a typical China Airlines long haul flight I’d expected. Nothing special and definitely not as good as it main competitor EVA. However the flight time suits me better (as EVA quite often involves a stop over at Bangkok).

### "service was below average"
Taipei to Beijing. They were just doing their job. Very few ground staffs were there to help with the boarding. The flight attendants made no greeting when boarding and very limited interaction during the entire flight. The guy sitting next to me did not straight the seat back when takeoff and landing yet no cabin crew paid attention to it. The meal was okay. I am not picky about flight meal at all. A flight attendant sat on the jump seat with her legs crossed and stared into space after meal service. Together, the service was below average regarding Asia's airline but I would fly with China Airlines again if the ticket goes really affordable.

### "Los Angeles to Taipei"
Los Angeles to Taipei. As a mother travelling with infant, it was really hard time to keep baby feeling comfortable and didn't disturb to other passengers. But the flight crews helped me too many things during the flight. I do appreciate the cabin staff help. I would recommend about China Airlines. Good Service!

### "be flying  China Airlines again"
Sydney to London via Taipei. As a family of 2 adults and a 14month old traveling to the UK, a balance of comfort and budget was important and after extensive research, I decided to give China Airlines a try since they’ve opened a 1 stop route SYD - LGW on brand new A350’s with a design awarded business cabin. I’ve flown business to the UK before with Qantas and Malaysian Airlines. Pre flight was simple with online pre-selection of meals, seats and free WiFi offer available but no limo service. Business check in counter and express path for security meant quick transit to the SkyTeam lounge which wasn’t as nice as the Qantas lounge and limited food & bev options. Priority boarding was available and once on board, the choice of the China Airlines business product proved itself to be a good one. The cabin and lighting is excellent, the flat bed seats/suites are modeled on Qatar and are spacious & comfortable. With an evening departure, our son slept with my wife for most of the SYD - TPE leg. A large screen with IFE including Pepper Pig kept him amused for the short time he was awake. Only downside was some language barriers with several stewardesses & western food was below average. TPE airport transit was straight forward with a modern comfortable lounge, baby room and showers along with good Asian food available. TPE - LGW boarded quickly again with priority boarding for business but once on board, the service stood out as better than the prior leg, largely because the cabin staff all spoke better English. The rules are more relaxed on this airline so letting our son play with his toys in the footwell area of my seat when he was awake was a big plus (Qantas would not have allowed this for safety reasons I suspect). Qantas also insist on making your baby sleep with the baby seat belt attachment on which is awkward and unhelpful when he’s already asleep. The food was also better on this leg and Pol Roger 2006 vintage pink champagne was excellent! Overall, My wife and I felt the seat product is superior to Qantas’ new business product which we flew to Hawaii in Nov. the in-flight service & food is inferior but here’s what the compromise gets you and your family, business return to London for 2/3rds of the Qantas cost or most other premium airlines prices. I’m a gold frequent flyer with Qantas but if they can’t get closer in price, I’ll be flying with China Airlines again for the next UK visit.

### "had a great experience"
Flew China Airlines May 8th from Manila to Taipei. In my opinion their service is one of the best. FA's are very friendly and accommodating. There is no meal option for the flight but meal is superb. I had a great experience.

### "friendly and professional"
Tokyo to Taipei. Great customer service. We were late and they helped us through security and ran with us to show us the gate. Very friendly and professional, highly recommended. The food isn't the best but  is average. Drink service is nice (tea, coffee, water, wine). Lots of new movies, Hollywood and subtitled Japanese and Chinese as well.

### "recommend China Airlines"
Brisbane to Sapporo via Taipei. Skiing trip over Easter to Japan, staff very friendly both in the air and on the ground. In flight entertainment was pretty good. Food and drinks were also pretty good, with the exception of one breakfast (western choice) which was not good, some combination of omelette, ham and pasta. All in all I would highly recommend China Airlines and already booked the next flight to London.

### "staff were polite and friendly"
Gatwick to Taipei was a pleasant enough experience. Check-in was easy, staff were polite and friendly and the cabin crew were accommodating enough. Taipei to Gatwick was a little disappointing but not terrible. Our flight was delayed by 30 minutes. Cabin crew were pretty cold, very rarely showing a smile and we felt more of an inconvenience than appreciated customers. Food was ok, and whilst they would bring drinks when asked, they were often a bit stingy with amounts poured. If you go in with low expectations as I did I think you'll actually be surprised. Not terrible, but certainly not special.

### not an overwhelming experience"
Taipei to Gatwick as my return journey. After a below expectation outgoing flight, the inbound flight was improved. Check in was smooth at a business class only counter. However the CI staff at the information desk was very rude to passengers making enquirers. Not a best representation of the company. It was very disappointing that as a business class passenger there is no dedicated lane for security and immigration. Security queue for both T1 (China Airlines) and T2 (EVA and China) tend to be long and neither airlines have special facilities for their business class passengers. The lounge in Taipei T1 (CI Dynasty lounge, the one closer to Gate A) was ok. It has no window but the design was classic. Food and drink choices were lacking. Boarding was announced in the lounge and there was a business class only bridge so you can skip the queue even if you are late at the gate. Service on this sector was significantly improved. I was offerred food and wine menu and was told that I should be able to change my food choice if I wanted to (I had pre-ordered online). The cabin manager introduced herself and offered a warm welcome. Again attention to details/amenities/food and drink were not as great as its main competitor EVA but this is partly compensated by the brand new airplane. Despite not offering full duvet and turn down service, sleep quality was good. The entertainment system also worked well. I personally found the onboard lounge on A350 a waste of space. I was told by the cabin manager that the lounge on 777 was larger and served its purpose and unfortunately it is not the case on A350. Business class passengers also only have 1 toilet (there are actually 2 but the other is frequented by passengers on deluxe economy). Overall the flight was a easy ride and we arrived at Gatwick early despite a late departure. It is not an overwhelming experience but it did work.

### "flight attendants were rock-faced"
Melbourne to Christchurch return. Legroom was the best thing about flights. Seat width was excellent. Head rests were comfy enough. On flight back I was on back row seat with supposedly no recline, but it still reclined nicely which was great. Bonus for back row seat: there was bonus small ov locker. All seats on return flight had curious addition of a mirror. Slightly useful. Flight service on first flight: except for one kind older staff all other flight attendants were rock-faced. English announcements not good enough. Crew were much more courteous & helpful on flight back. Piloting skills: inconsistent. First flight had way more turbulence. Landing was shockingly bumpy. Flight back was smoother with perfect takeoff/landings. IFE was ancient/laggy. Food on first flight good. Return flight food way too oily.

### "feels they are just doing their job"
Gatwick to Taipei. I haven't flown China Airlines for 20 years primarily due to their poor safety record in the 90s and also due to lack of network in Europe. After they launched direct flight to London I decided to take the opportunity and fly  back to Taiwan for lunar new year. I booked it through online travel agent and it was easy. However China Airlines website is difficult to navigate. Menu pre selection is not shown on your main profile, and entertainment was on another website. Nevertheless the online check in process was very easy. At London Gatwick the ground service is handled by a 3rd party company. They are very courteous and friendly. The lounge was No. 1 at the South Terminal. Nothing fancy but did it work. Boarding was well organised as business passengers were invited to take a seat near the bridge. The flight in the business class section was empty. 8 passengers occupied the entire 32 seats. Immediate reaction was the airplane was spotless and clean, while service was lacking. They only offered soft drinks before take off. It was noticeable how quiet the A350 was - far better than 777 and it was very spacious. The entertainment was good - large screen, good choices of movie and a lot of interaction function. The seat was  comfortable. What fell short (well, when being compared with EVA which is its main competitors) is the ambition to deliver a full service. On EVA you have great amenity, pajama, great selection of wines and food and service was second to none. On China Airlines it feels they are just doing their job without going extra mile. The biggest disappointment is the layout of the A350. There are 32 seats but there is only 1 toilet in the front of the airplane plus one at the rear of the business class section which is often visited by passengers in Premium Economy. Overall it's a ok flight but nothing really stands out. If the price is right I will still fly with China Airlines as it saves few hours and I really like A350; otherwise I would prefer EVA Air or Cathay Pacific over China Airlines.

### "always a painful experience"
I flew this route from Taipei to Penang a few times and always with China Airlines as it is the only company which offers this direct connection. However, it is always a painful experience, except the staff who is nice, the rest is really poor starting with the plane itself. It is a miserable plane with much too little space for a 5 hours international flight, this type of plane is usually used for domestic short flights only. Then there is no individual monitor and you have one poor movie playing for the all flight on a common screen. The food is low quality and this flight is usually always late "due to the late arrival of the plane". Only one thing is high is the price. It is actually so bad that I considered taking a Cathay Pacific flight with a stop in Hong Kong to not fly in this flying sardine can.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
Sydney to Amsterdam via Taipei and was pleasantly surprised. Did not travel with check-in luggage so the only interaction I had with staff on the ground was at the gate. I checked in on-line and needed to get my boarding card printed. This was done promptly and I was directed to board the aircraft. Cabin in Business was clean, neat and looked well maintained. Cabin staff were very professional, used my name and ensured that I had all I required but were not intrusive. Sat in 12K on this leg of the journey, found the ambient temperature too hot, 180 degree flatbed was unfortunately wasted on this leg as couldn't sleep comfortably at that temperature. Arrived in Taipei with a 4hr wait, used the lounge which was comfortable and staff were pleasant, a few of them spoke English which helped. Used the shower facility which was clean. Boarded flight leg to AMS on time, flight left on time as did previous leg. Filled out my breakfast request, put my bed into flat position and fell asleep. Ambient temperature was lower and I slept really well, right through the dinner service. Was in seat 11A on this leg and was wondering to myself whether being in the second row from the front of the aircraft had any influence on the temperature. Seating starts at row 10 on China Airlines A350. When I woke up about 6hrs later, the staff were apologising for not serving me dinner, had to assure them that i was alright, they brought me biscuits and green tea. Several hours later after enjoying their In-Flight Entertainment, I was served my breakfast as ordered. Each and every interaction I had on these two legs were as one should expect of a business class cabin. Would probably fly them again if the same deal presented itself when I needed to travel.

### "Really nice seats"
San Francisco to Delhi via Taipei. Really nice seats, good veggie food, polite cabin crew but the ground staff members at San Francisco are really rude and cant really understand English. The ground staff member at SFO didn't check our baggage in and it arrived one week late it was left at SFO, but overall the flight was nice.

### "all very friendly and helpful"
Taipei to Frankfurt. Short term, only 8 days before the flight I purchased a very cheap ticket online with BYO. Australian ground staff was very polite and helpful to get some decent legspace for me. Stewardesses were very friendly and helpful, food was tasty and well warmed, requests for extra wine and a double gin and tonic was swiftly satisfied! Whilst the staff did not go around much offering drinks, they  responded quickly to requests. To my surprise there was no late dinner on the 13 hour leg Taipei to Frankfurt, but requests for some snacks, water and wine was quickly responded to in a very courteous manner. Both aircraft were very new, clean and both flights were without any turbulences. (Happens to me regularly on routes via China for whatever reason). I am very happy and will use them whenever I can in future.

### "Quite an enjoyable experience"
Bangkok to Taipei. Quite an enjoyable experience. Outgoing aircraft is in older interior and outdated PTV, very small and blurry. But the aircraft seemed to be properly cleaned and well-maintained. Incoming aircraft is in a new interior, new PTV but slightly less legroom. Food for both flight taste good, reasonable portion size, drink selection is a bit limited. Flight attendants are nice and professional.

### "journey was highly enjoyable"
Taipei to Sydney. The journey was highly enjoyable and memorable for all the right reasons. No queue at check-in, with excellent ground crew at check-in and boarding. Premimum Economy had priority boarding. The amenities pack included slippers, eye shades, lip balm, moisturiser, toothbrush/toothpaste and a hair comb. In flight entertainment was excellent with big screens and a large collection of recent movies. Staff were very friendly and professional. The Premium Economy seat is the best I have experienced, it reclines within the hard shell and the leg support lifts out the furthest I have experienced. Food was also high quality.

### "disgusted with the staff"
Brisbane to Okinawa via Taipei. As a noticably pregnant woman flying with China I was disgusted with the staff. Not one of them acknowledged I was pregnant or bothered to help me get my bags into the overhead compartment, whenever I talked to staff there was thinly veiled contempt in their gaze, demeanor and voices. I was not a customer but problem. As an Australian I have never been treated like this by any other airline. On embarkation the cabin was thick with the smell of body odor, unclean, musty. The seats are crammed in like sardines and the food is disgusting. It was a read eye flight and they kept the lights on and fed us dinner at 2am when all I wanted to do was sleep, the flight was super bumpy and I did not feel safe with the condition of the inside of the plane surely making me wonder about the maintenance of the plane mechanics.

### "crew did not want to be there"
Rome to Auckland via Taipei. Boarded in Rome, found my seat noticed a blanket on the seat not in a plastic bag. Opened it out and it was covered in black hairs. Found a flight attendant to ask for new blanket, and she said "oh that's been used" I had to ask for a clean one that came in a bag. The food was very bland I made the mistake and ordered vegetarian oriental, flavourless! The crew did not want to be there, they were remote in their expressions and service. When I asked for another water or apple juice they seemed annoyed that I asked. After the 9 hour layover in Taipei we were then directed to an Airbus A330 in my opinion far too small for a long haul flight to Brisbane. It was cramped, as in knees hitting the seat in front, and really uncomfortable. The on board IFE (inflight entertainment) screen was the size of a small paper back book, again not suitable for viewing a movie on a long haul flight. The crew were also detached on this flight as well. I don't expect the Crown Jewels when we fly but some sort of basic service is all one would expect. We would never ever fly China Airlines again, yes it was a good price but we got what we paid for. I feel I am not being harsh, I was a flight attendant for many years, service and a smile was number one priority.

### "not fly China airlines any more"
Brisbane to Nanjing via Taipei. I was 6 months pregnant when I flew China airlines. My husband and I requested for the priority seat which has more space when we checked in, the assistant told us she selected the front spacious seats for us. When we arrive the airplane we found out she put us in the middle of 4 seats row, where it’s hard for me to get up and go to toilet. We spoke with the staff on airline for help and they are rude and didn’t help us at all. It was a 9 hours fly trip and my legs & hands are super swollen. I will not fly with China airlines any more. It’s a nightmare for me!

### "Worst customer service ever"
Amsterdam to Sydney via Taipei. Do not fly with China Airlines - Just moved to Sydney with my friend where we left Dublin on the 3rd January and due to the airline we only arrived yesterday, the 5th so it took us 2 days when it should have taken 26 hours! There were delays on every single flight and when we got to Taipei we had to wait 14 hours to get a connection fight due to a delay in Amsterdam because the GPS on the plane was broken for 3 hours (sitting on the runway). When we arrived at Sydney we had no bags and were told they would arrive today, the 6th by 2pm, we still have no bags and it’s 9pm! When we asked to get seats together after sever delays this wasn’t even possible which was a joke! Worst customer service ever! I will never fly with them again!

### "food tasted pretty good"
Taipei to Singapore. Cabin was dated but clean with seats with generous legroom and recline despite the presence of an entertainment box under all seats. Flight attendants weren't the most friendly but did their jobs well, serving refreshments and snacks. The food tasted pretty good, the chicken tasted fresh. Portions need to increase (they were about the size of my passport) IFE was very bad. It probably hasn't been upgraded since the day it was installed way back in 2005. Its resolution was so low that viewing a movie on it was torture. Its touch screen was so unresponsive that I had to literally jab it to get the screen to recognise my touch. Its only redeeming factor was its wide selecton of movies. Bring your on entertainment when going on CAL's regional A330s.

### "staff at check-in was so rude"
Singapore to Surabaya. The staff at check-in was so rude. I asked for the front seat and she just replied “no more.” I knew the flight is not full, it’s just because she is lazy to re-print. Than she asked to weigh my bag, it weigh almost 11KG yet I traveled with 3 of us and 1 hand luggage. She said it should be checked-in also, but it’s all laptop & camera, how you check-in them? She and her colleagues were arrogant like see me like she was underestimating me. And then she changed my seats to the front lines.

### "did not seem alert enough"
My flight from Taipei to Okinawa was a pleasing one. But, the returning flight from OKA to TPE was indeed disappointing. No fault on the ground service, no fault on the fleet. Everything was fine except that the cabin crew serving the on board meal that day, they did not seem alert enough. She did not even notice she missed out distributing my meal to me. Even though the flight time was only 1 hour and distribution of meals needed to be completed fast, as a full service airline, they need to make an effort to come back and check to ensure every passenger received what they were supposed to. The "I don't care as long as I have done my job" attitude has pulled down my rating to this airline.

### "service has really deteriorated"
Los Angeles to Manila via Taipei. Plane late in departure by about two hours without reason. My connecting flight wait time from TPE to MNL is also two hours so we got there just when my connecting flight is leaving. I thought that the airline would at least make up for part of the delay in the air. No, they did not do that. We landed in TPE exactly the time my connecting flight was suppose to leave, I noted that my connecting flight was delayed by half an hour. I thought I may have a chance of making it. Unfortunately, the airline staff did not help at all. From the flight crew to the ground crew no one helped at all. First of all they did not request arriving passengers whose destination is TPE to wait in their seat while people with connecting flight leave the plane first. Once I got off the plane, there was no staff to expedite me from going from one terminal to the other terminal. In the past they have provided car to transport you but this time there was none. The first staff I asked told me that I will miss the plane and to proceed to the flight counter to be rescheduled for the next flight. I proceed to the flight counter and I encountered a second staff who promptly told me that if I rush I might make my connecting flight. To make long story short, I did make my connecting flight by running and without any help from the airline. China Airlines service has really deteriorated as compared to the past. They were not the cheapest nor were they most expensive. I only travel with them because I am also a Taiwanese. I will look for other airline to take in the future. The service is just not there. I can get abuse by other airline for a lot cheaper price!

### "not choose China Airlines again"
Taipei to Kagoshima. This was a bland flight. From the ground to the plane the service was really standard, some staffs were good some were really bad. The staffs reveal this company did not train their staff really well. Some of their staff was not so professional and ridiculous. I would not choose China Airline again.

### "Choose EVA Air instead if you can"
Amsterdam to Taipei. Economy class on the A350 and whilst a newish airplane, the service standards leave a lot to be desired. I flew the longer route to Taipei via BKK with EVA Air in June this year and this latest trip demonstrated why China Airlines are a long way behind them. The China Air staff, whilst courteous and pleasant, could not speak or understand English very well, getting drink requests and even the meal type all totally wrong. Their attention to checking the cabin safety during turbulence was also very poor and they appeared to be on a very lazy working system during this flight. Call button answering was very slow.Food was edible but little more to commend it. Seat had good legroom space, but seat cushions seemed very thin and hard. Choose EVA Air instead if you can.

### "an excellence experience"
Economy class flight from San Francisco to Bangkok return via Taipei. I had to cancel my initial flight at the gate and the staff were very helpful. The call center staff provided me information as to how to apply for a refund and book another fare. I was able to confirm my cancellation online and then book another fare confident I would be refunded my flight fare minus $100 cancellation fee. This is exceptional and one of the reasons I fly China Airlines. The fare was refunded within 3 days to my credit card. The boarding process is very efficient and the staff work hard at settling customers for on time departure and arrival. The seats are a 3 x 3 layout and with the person in front on full recline still plenty of leg room. The meal service is efficient with 2 choices for the main meal. The food on the return flight is better than the food from the USA. I find this the case on all airlines. The entertainment options are limited however there is sufficient choice to remain occupied. The toilets were maintained in a clean state throughout the flight. All requests were met promptly and there was no staff down on the flight. It seemed there were always enough crew available to serve customer needs. The flight to Bangkok was without incident. Smooth and the captain kept us well information. The return flight was less proficient. No warning of turbulence and often the seat belt sign was initiated well into the turbulence. The Taipei airport has reasonable facilities for a 5 hour lay over. Overall an excellence experience.

### "rude and offensive manner"
Kaohsiung to Bangkok on October 31, 2017 at 14:40. Check in between 12:45 am and 1:15 pm: I approached the front desk where a woman was serving. I had as usual already checked in online after the lady had already printed the ticket, put the stitch on my suitcase, she asked me if I had a flight from Bangkok and I replied to yes. She asked me for a ticket, but at that time I could not have the airport wifi, and she called the supervisor who in a rude and offensive manner to me, ripped the ticket and if I could not show it, I had to stay ground. Since the next flight was with Thaismile from Bangkok to Pennh, I went to the EVA air desk and they printed kindly the confirmation of the flight. China Airlines need more and more an efficient service and polite, friendly staff, what it wasn’t in my case. Right now China Airlines is no longer the only one to fly from Kaohsiung to Bangkok, I finally have the choice to decide with whom to fly: the next return to Kaohsiung will be soon by Thaismile.

### "Flight attendants showed no interest"
Los Angeles to Taipei. The Boeing 777-300ER was nice and clean inside, and seats quite comfortable. That is where the good part ends. The western food was simply terrible, and whilst the Asian meals were eaten by Chinese travelers near me, the western meals seemed to be left. Flight attendants showed no interest at all in the problems, and seemed very poor in being able to communicate in English which is a worry for other issues. Onboard entertainment okay, but this was all geared to Chinese passengers. The ticket I got was very cheap, but now I know why so cheap!

### "Seats were comfortable"
Los Angeles to Kuala Lumpur via Taipei with China Airlines. Staff was very professional and friendly. Seats were comfortable for economy and entertainment was sufficient. Fruit plate meal was adequate. I have flown this route a few times and never had an issue. Price and times fit my needs perfectly.

### "look forward to traveling "
Los Angeles to Denpasar via Taipei. I have not flown yet my trip will be this December 2017 to go see my daughter who is giving birth to my first grand baby. I have not flown overseas for a very long time so I wanted to make a good decision on the selection of the airline. When I called the 800-number I experienced exceptional customer service. In the past when I've called other airlines I get this feeling that I should be asking all the questions online and that I am bothering them. The woman was very polite, took her time with me, answered all her questions and made me feel important. Thank you for going the extra mile and I look forward to traveling on your airline in a few months. I'm expecting that part of it to go well as well.

### "flight attendants were hard to fault"
I flew the first leg from Newcastle to Amsterdam on KLM. Crucially both flights I took with China Airlines departed on-time. From Amsterdam to Taipei I flew on a more-or-less brand new Airbus A350 which was very modern, clean and comfortable. From Taipei to Nanchang was on a Boeing 737 which served its purpose for a short flight. The flight attendants were hard to fault on both flights given they were quick to respond to calls and very polite. The meal options were fine but I didn't like the fact they only had Chinese snacks available at the galley. However there was a full bar service throughout the flight and they were happy to keep serving both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks throughout the flight. Aside from the issue with snacks, the only other in-flight issue I had was with the entertainment system not having quite the range of audio and movie options of airlines like Emirates. The only seriously negative issue I had was the transit experience at Taipei Airport with the security area being far too small and lacking staff members meaning long queues. Also Taipei airport terminal 1 departures area was lacking in international dining and shopping options, which is disappointing given Taipei Taoyuan is supposed to be one of Asia's major hubs. However based on my overall experience I will happily fly China Airlines again.

### "staff were helpful and polite"
Kuala Lumpur to San Francisco return via Taipei. The ground staff were helpful and polite. The cabin crews might be one of the best , during my return flight (SFO - TPE) there was a passenger who got airsickness and  crew handled the incident very well. For the food it was also nice. The price is very reasonable.

### "Service was very poor"
Manila to Taipei. Food was awful, the worst food I ever had. Service was very poor. Flight was diverted to Hong Kong due to typhoon. We arrived at Hongkong around 10pm. They did not give us dinner. They bus us to our hotel which was about 45 minutes drive from the airport. We got there around 1:00am. Check in was completed at 2:00am. Then they infomed us we would leave hotel at 7:30am and the scheduled departure time of our flight was 1030am. Everyone was rushing to have breakfast and a lot did not even have breakfast. On the way to the airport one of the bus broke down on the freeway. We had to pick up the passengers that were on that bus. Flight finally left at almost 1:00pm. Did not feed us a thing. Then they gave us a food that was completely spoiled! Never again will I fly this airline.

### "checked out tickets at least 3x"
San Francisco to Tokyo via Taipei. It was fine until I realized what was going on. Mind you plenty of space for all, food was fine, but when we first got to our seats in both long haul parts, they checked out tickets at least 3x. Now my daughter is multicultural and i am African American. So our alone tones are way apart. There was no need for 3/4 attendants to ask for our tickets. Families come in a variety, no need for all that checking.

### "leg space was good"
Los Angeles to Jakarta via Taipei. The trip was so easy from LA to with short layover to Jakarta. The first flight was about 14hrs, I was in economy class and even here who can feel so attendant quality of airline. Especially cleanliness of WC. I am tall and leg space was good so I could sleep without any problem almost all flight time. I used them also on the way back from Jakarta to LA, same great service. For the price they offer from LA to many destination you get top quality.

### "fly again if the price was right"
Okinawa to Melbourne via Taipei. The Business class lounge in Naha is a generic lounge and very basic - think biscuits and instant noodles. There was a very large family group with many children filling up the Business cabin on the first leg, and both check-in and boarding processes were rather chaotic. This was compounded by an unexplained 60-minute delay in departure. On board the cabin crew were racing to serve meals and drinks to the packed Business cabin on this short flight. Service was, perhaps necessarily, rather abrupt. The seat was very comfortable, and my vegetarian meal was OK. Once in Taipei we had a short but pleasant sojourn in the China Airlines lounge. On the second flight the crew were efficient but not particularly friendly. The A330 seat was more comfortable than the one I had going in the other direction - not flat, but I was able to get a good sleep. My inflight screen didn't work for the whole flight. The vegetarian meals were large but a bit stodgy and uninteresting. The toilets were kept spotless. The leg from Taipei to Melbourne operated on time. I would fly China Airlines again if the price was right.

### "This flight was cheap"
This flight was cheap and offered good value. Check-in was fast and the Qantas lounge in Melbourne, while very busy, was a pleasant start to the journey. Onboard service was friendly and efficient. The cabin was spotless. On this A330 my seat, which was spacious and comfortable in the seated position, was angled and bumpy when extended, making sleep difficult. The IFE screen was small by business class standards, and my vegetarian meals were rather bland. The transit lounge at Taipei was pleasant. The refitted B747 on the second leg to Sapporo had more comfortable seats and larger IFE screens. The vegetarian meals loaded in Taipei were more tasty than the offerings ex-Melbourne. For the price and convenience on flights to Japan I would recommend China Airlines.

### "thank you for the extra effort"
Penang to Los Angeles via Taipei. On our first leg of our trip home from Penang to Los Angeles via Taipei, I unfortunately left my tablet in the seat back pocket. It was within about 30 minutes after leaving the plane that I realized I had left my tablet. I went to the customer relations desk to report it and then when the staff came to the gate I again asked for their assistance. The lady at the gate followed up with me, before takeoff on the second leg, and indicated they had found my tablet and would put it on the next flight to LAX and to speak with the airline staff once we landed in the US. I have to be honest, in saying I was a little skeptical, but I provided my information to the staff at LAX and began to make phone calls the next day. Within a day and half I received a phone call from a young man at LAX that he had my tablet in hand. Thank you again to the young lady in Taipei and the LAX staff member for the extra effort in finding and delivering my tablet back to me.

### "experience was top notch"
First time with China Airlines. Transited from Hong Kong via a Cathay A350 (see other review) and I wasn't expecting much. Lounge and boarding were not good. Poor quality lounge and chaotic inefficient boarding. From then on experience was top notch. A warm crew welcomed us aboard a beautifully outfitted business class.The seat was private, well designed and perfect for sleeping as the flight departed at 11.35pm. IFE was great, WiFi terrific, not a single complaint. Didn't eat dinner but the breakfast served was excellent. The crew bent over backwards to ensure everyone was happy and well looked after. Kudos to them. I'll ride their 350 over Cathay's any time.

### "A very reasonable fare"
A very reasonable fare from Singapore to Taipei. The cabin was clean, cabin crew was very courteous. Foods served onboard are great. My only complaints are the movie selections. The length of the legroom is reasonable for Economy Class, you get what you paid for. Would travel with them again.

### "would fly with them again"
New York JFK to Taipei. One of the best in flight experiences that I have had. The cabin was spotless. Sheets for sleeping. Excellent meals and in flight service. Bathrooms spotless during the flight. Excellent snacks and in flight entertainment. Great privacy, only one seat by each window and unique pods. Loved it and would fly with them again. Lounge at JFK only thing not great.

### "the service is horrible"
Denpasar to Taipei. Late departure, premium economy is a shame. The service is horrible and the food was a complete disaster. It was definitely my last time traveling with China Airlines. Comparing to différent airlines, China Airlines are very far away from the quality standard. The multimedia service is terrible, old movie, bad quality screen, some of documentary are from 2000.

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
San Francisco to Denpasar via Taipei. Worst airline I've ever flown. This is the first time in my life where I was forced to check in a small carry-on, even though it weighed less than 10kg, then it was "lost" and never recovered. I spent my entire vacation without my clothes, calling the airline and the airport every day, and never got a single straight answer. They were incredibly unhelpful in trying to find my bag and have not found it in over a week. Aside from that, the seats are rather uncomfortable and meals less than average. On one of the flights they ran out of drinks within the first hour. The only saving grace is that there is in-flight entertainment with a good selection of movies.

### "Terrible customer service"
San Francisco to Singapore via Taipei. Terrible customer service. I had booked my tickets 2.5 months before my travel date and was only just contacted 3 weeks before I was due to leave through Expedia saying that there had been a change in my itinerary. My returning flight from SFO-TPE-SIN now had an 8-hr layover instead of a 2-hr layover because China Airlines was no longer operating their morning flight that I had previously selected. Despite my many calls to Expedia to mediate this with China Airlines over a week and a half, no appropriate options were given. China Airlines would give me a full refund, but not reimburse me for the higher ticket fares that I would incur since I would be booking just 3 weeks before my date. After exhausting every option I had, I had no choice but to accept the 8-hr layover in TPE. Their inability to provide any suitable options makes me regret that I ever chose China Airlines. This was going to be my first time traveling with them, and because of this frustrating situation, its left me not ever wanting to choose China Airlines. Their poor customer service and unwillingness to satisfy the paying customer is why I will never again fly with China Airlines.

### "a very pleasant experience"
A very reasonable fare from Tokyo to Hong Kong via Taipei on business class. I had flown this sector last year in March, now it is as good. Very courteous service and delicious food. Plane clean and IFE is decent with enough choices to keep one occupied. Transfer at Taipei, although a very close call of 30 minute due to delay from Tokyo, Hong Kong flight was held for the 4 of us from Tokyo, that was a very kind gesture! We had to run to the next gate though. The cabin crew were helpful to assist in settling us down with cold drink and hot towel. Upon arrival in HKG, our luggage did not make it due to the very quick transfer. However, on the next day, it was delivered back to my home with abundant apology. All in all, a very pleasant experience despite the hiccups.

### "food and service were fine"
Flew Seoul Incheon - Taipei, CI 163/162 and return. CI 163 was late departing Taipei by 45 minutes, so we left ICN about an hour and a half late as well. The return flight was right on time with no problems. I purchased an economy sale ticket, but was allowed to select a business class seat in the upper deck when buying the ticket for TPE-ICN. At online check in (T-24), a seat in the upper deck ICN-TPE was available for selection. There were two different kinds of seats. ICN-TPE was very very old recliner seat with old, old AVOD in the armrest (Exit Row).TPE-ICN was a newer shell seat that was not lie-flat. The food and service were fine. It was economy service with one tray of food and no special business treatment. I would not purchase these tickets for business, but would gladly pay economy and take the free seat upgrade.

### "aircrafts have been improved dramatically"
Flew San Francisco to Yangon via Taipei. I've been flying China Airlines for almost 2 decades. Their cabin services, lounge services and aircrafts have been improved dramatically in the recent years. With the new B777s and A350s, their hard products are phenomenal. English among crew has been steadily improving, but is still long way to go. Foods served onboard are great, especially, the flights originated in TPE. Cabin cleanliness is impeccable as crew clean up almost every 10-15 mins. For business class, they clean right after someone uses. I have flown their economy, premium economy and premium business products. They all deserve a high rating according to what you pay for.

### "terrible legroom"
Taipei to Auckland via Brisbane with China Airlines. Very nice and attentive cabin crew. Terrible legroom. Small screens monitors and not lot a large choice of movies and tv shows. No power sockets or Wi-Fi. Food choices were very limited (Asian food). Very thin blankets. Cabin and toilets were tidy during the flight. The stop in Brisbane is ok but you have to go again to security control (not the airline's fault, of course). Boarding in Brisbane was a little confusing (transit mixed with local passengers and the waiting room at the gate has a few seats).

### "check-in wasn't very nice or professional"
Flew China Airlines from Auckland to Taipei via Brisbane. Check-in wasn't very nice or professional, firstly they couldn't find the reservation on the system even when giving the e-ticket number. Secondly they said I needed to show my outbound airline ticket from Hong Kong. It seems to be a Hong Kong requirement but they only tell you that at check in that if you don't have it then you can't board. The A330 had very narrow legroom, the IFE had a small screen and movie choices, blankets were very thin, no wi-fi, no power outlets. Very nice cabin crew, food was basic (no mineral water if you asked for a glass).

### "nice meal for a short flight"
Hong Kong to Kaohsiung with China Airlines. Good waiting time at the check-in. Nice plane for a short flight like this and they give pillows and blankets. Very narrow room leg space. IFE ok. Very attentive and careful cabin crew. Boring safety film, nice meal for such a short flight. Always a very cold cabin temperature.

### "I will avoid China Airlines"
❎ Unverified |  Los Angeles to Yangon via Taipei. On board service was ok but this airline seems disorganized and not able to stick to a schedule. None of the flights I took left on time, or even close. Coming back from Yangon I missed the Los Angeles flight because they were so late leaving Yangon, which wasnt that busy. Spent 7 hours in Taipei airport and they comp'd me a burger king meal for the screw up. With a gift like that why even bother! I will avoid China Airlines in the future.

### "Staff not happy to work"
Very bad experience from Taipei to New York JFK, use for the first time the premium economy class but it was a disastrous experience. Staff apparently not happy to work. Seat dirty, screen broken, meal didn't serve per my request. This is a most horrible airlines experience. I will not recommend China Airlines, my problem now is how will be the flight back from JFK?

### "I was disappointed"
Los Angeles to Hong Kong via Taipei return. Me and my wife fly economy class, when we checked in at Hong Kong airport I asked the counter staff if there are any open seats at the front from Taipei to Los Angeles since our seats are the very last second, and was told it's pretty much full - however after transferred and board the plane, we found there are empty seats available. Two meals were provided on the flight, second one is cold and both meals are just very average in quality, taste and small in size. Since it was a might night flight, after the first flight the light was off and we are try to get some sleep, however it was so cold so me and my wife had to put on our coats and covered with a blanket, but still too cold so I went to asked the flight attendant and was told the air from outside is cold and the front cabin is ok. No dessert was provided on the flight, flight attendants have no smiles. I came from Taiwan and this was the second time I flew China Airlines Since I was moved to the US 33 years ago. I like Singapore Airlines, but 10 years ago they canceled the route, then I'm happy with the EVA Air. By the suggestion of a friend I fly China Airlines this time, and I was disappointed. My flight from Los Angeles to taipei was delayed 3.5  hours but was never notified, I found it out at preboarding one day earlier. At the airport I talked with another passenger and was told that she went to the airport on time and never got any notice.

### "food the great disappointment"
Brisbane to Sapporo via Taipei. Check-in at Brisbane was prompt and professional. We were able to book our seats 6 months earlier, although this wasn't made clear to us at the time of booking. We made our seat allocations 3 months prior to the flight and could not get our preferred seating on the Taipei to Sapporo sector. No big deal. Whilst this flight leaves quite late - 11.15pm it gets in to Sapporo at a convenient time, for transfer to the ski fields in Hokkaido. The lounge China Airlines uses is the Plaza Premium Lounge - reasonable selection of snacks, limited choice of acceptable quality wines, average service. It doesn't feel like a 'special occasion'. Boarding is quick and again, professional. Juices and water are offered before take-off. Amenity pack includes lip balm and lotions, but of average quality. Seats are in a 2-2-2- formation in an older aircraft. The food, on both sectors, was the great disappointment of these flights. We have had better in economy on other carriers. The wine selection was of a good standard. The service is attentive and friendly. Entertainment options are average. The lounge in Taipei is of quite good, with a selection of snacks, hot cooked-to-order dishes.

### "a notch below other major airlines"
❎ Unverified |  New York to Hanoi via Taipei. Definitely a notch below other major airlines in East Asia in Business Class in every area, but I mostly want to comment on one thing. I thought it was very unusual when - on a 15 hour flight leaving JFK at midnight - they turned on all the lights in business class for the mid-flight meal and left them on for 3 hours. It was sure annoying to be woken up mid-flight for some little snack that I'm sure nobody would have even wanted if they hadn't woken us all up. And I don't recall ever seeing it happen on another airline. I asked if I could switch back to Economy where the lights were off so I could sleep, but she didn't get my sarcasm and went looking for a seat for me!! Also the lounge was overflowing to the point of not being worth it. Service was in general slow and confusing, and my entertainment system had a lot of bugs, but seats were up to standard.

### "give some customers more privileges"
Amsterdam to Jakarta via Taipei. From Amsterdam an old A340,but with the 2-4-2 seating. Leg room on the window seats is obstructed by big entertainment box under seat in front of you. Online check-in on China Airlines website didn't work. Checked in at the airport and found out that my seat requests disappeared and was on standby, strange because I had a confirmed ticket. The information counter was helpful and could give us a window/aisle seat and we were told that for online checkin from Amsterdam Airport you have to use the KLM website (strange because I have CI ticket and not a KLM ticket). Taipei to Jakarta on a B777-300ER. Nice interior (bamboo wood, mood lighting, modern IFE). Again a full flight with a 1 hour delay. Jakarta to Taipei checked in online 24 hours before departure via CI app. Plane was a B777 and choose the row of 2 at the back of economy. The next morning we found out that the plane was delayed (3 hours) and that they changed the Boeing 777 into the A330. This A330 was old and tired (worn seats) and had seen better days. Cabin crew was friendly. Last flight to Amsterdam an A350, checked in online 24 hours in advance. Seats were already assigned and couldn't change the seats. All the seats were 'not available'. We went to the airport early (5 hours before departure) and tried to get emergency exit seats, bulkhead seats or last row seats but nothing was possible. The checkin agent showed me the screen and told me that it was all blocked. Got the impression that China Airlines give some of the customers more privileges with seat requests because during the flight we found out that the blocked seats (we saw on the screen) were empty middle seats, probably to give the passengers in that row more personal space (this happened with 4 rows in economy). The A350 is a beautiful spacious aircraft. Good seats, even when the seat in front of you is reclined. Big windows and good, modern IFE. 30 minute delay but we arrived 10 minutes ahead our schedule time at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.

### "not use China Airlines again"
Amsterdam to Taipei, flying on a new A350 with China Airlines. The cabin was nice, but not cleaned very well - my table was sticky and the seatpocket had mess from last flight. I flew them one year ago, and this time the food is very low quality, small portions and choice was not available for either meal. Cabin attendants also seems much worse, this time they were not smiling once and as soon as tray was taken, the lights were out and staff disappeared. They could not understand or speak English properly either. I flew Eva Air from Taipei to US in last December, and their service is so much better than China Airlines. My flight from Amsterdam was cheap, but I will not use China Airlines again.

### "bag was considered abandoned "
Taipei to Los Angeles. I have been calling China Airlines since December 31st about my luggage. I have been told many different things from many representatives but mostly just leave voicemails that never get returned. I was told today that all my other attempts at contact were never documented and so my bag was considered abandoned and sent to storage in Taiwan.

### "given my seat to China Airlines employee"
Los Angeles to Taipei. The rudest staff I have ever encountered at a boardng gate, with the worst imaginable judgment. I flew into the LA airport from Minneapolis on January 2nd, about 3 hours before my China Airlines flight to Taipei, without a boarding pass for my flight to Taipei because Delta could not issue the international passes. I checked in to the China Airlines business lounge, who recorded my name and flight information and instructed me to wait until the Taipei flight was announced before picking up my boarding pass at the gate. When the flight was announced an hour later, I walked to the gate to get my boarding pass and was told that I was 5 minutes too late. they had awarded my business class seat to another traveler. (I reached the gate 40 minutes before takeoff, instead of 45 minutes.) I had paid roughly $3,000 for that business class ticket, had checked in with the business class lounge an hour earlier, and insisted that they let me board. The staff was unspeakably rude and insisted that I was wrong for being 5 minutes late, and that I must wait 24 hours for the next flight, and pay for my own hotel and other expenses. I remained at the gate complaining that it was unlikely that they could grant my business class ticket to another paying customer within 5 mintues after the 45-minute deadline. Then 10 minutes before takeoff, they told me they found me a seat. They claimed that a China Airlines staff had agreed to move to economy class "as a courtesy. Here is the punchline - the seat they "found" was my assigned seat, and they had given my seat to a China Airlines employee, and insisted up to the last minute that I must travel the next day. They had booted a paying business class customer so that an employee could take his seat instead. I am a regular customer of China Airlines, and service is normally okay, but this was one of the worst incidents I have encountered in 20+ years of business travel, and it was not caused by weather or technical problems.

### "was a pleasant flight"
This was a pleasant flight even it took nearly 2 hours transfer at TPE. The crew are very helpful - I really wanted to taste my own Choya Plum wine when the flight reached 30,000ft. Unfortunately the crew told me we can have the wine provided by airlines but not our own beverages. After that she brought over red and white wine. The seat are spacious and most importantly, A350 the new fleet comes with special Chinese painting design, great taste and a fresh experience. It was a full flight but we have never feel it crowded.

### "was a most enjoyable flight"
Brisbane to Auckland. Considering the price and the quality of the service and amenities, this was a most enjoyable flight. Seats were very comfortable, especially for a three and a half hour flight across the Tasman, but weren't flat bed, so wouldn't be so good for long haul. Aircraft was spotlessly clean and staff were very friendly and attentive. The food was more than acceptable and we had nothing to complain about. All the other airlines crossing the Tasman during the Christmas holidays were asking twice as much as China Airlines.

### "seats were pretty beat up"
Vienna to Denpasar via Taipei. China Airlines is pretty decent and the price was really good. We had a great experience considering the price and only a 3 hour layover. The seats were pretty beat up and a bit small, but leg space was good and service great. Taipei Airport had free wifi and ok alternatives for food. Inflight entertainment was lacking, with a very old small screen, but we didnt use it because we had our laptop to watch movies. The seats on the first plane did not have any headrest, but the second plane had it. I would not mind flying again, realising of course that companies like Qatar Airways, Emirates and Singapore Airlines are much better.

### "in-flight service was great"
This is not my first time flying business class from Kaohsiung to Jakarta with a short transfer in Hong Kong, since this is my frequent route almost every two month and also I am a frequent flyer of China Airlines. In Kaohsiung airport, China Airlines has 3 counters for priority members, but since the counters was also in waiting, so I was converted to economy class counter that vacant. The lounge is standard and I have accessed their lounge for almost one year noticing the food AND drink available was still similar. Boarding was quite smooth and on time. In Hong Kong, since the transfer is quite short, there was no time to enter the Skyteam lounge, but sometimes when the flight from Taipei was delayed then you will have some times for the lounge near Gate 15. As usual, in-flight service was great with the cabin manager would introduce him/herself to us. The food, drink and refreshment they provided in-flight was more than standard. Arrived in Jakarta, the baggage claim were faster and improving than before, only 15 minutes to wait until I had my baggage with me.

### "inflight service still terrible"
Taipei to Los Angeles. I used to fly China Airlines quite frequently. At that time, it had a reputation of not so good service, older planes, but good food. I have since been using other (newer) airlines going in and out of Taiwan the last few years. Recently, I was told the airline have undergone some renovations of planes, some newer airplanes, and so I decided to use China Airlines again. Much to my disappointment, both its ground service and inflight service are still terrible, to say the least. Upon arrival in Taipei, after everyone had already gotten off the plane and was waiting for their luggage, airlines change the carousel for luggage twice, making all the passenger running all over the airport looking for their luggages. The inflight crews were rude and rough. One of them was so eager and rushed to sell duty free stuff, his cart ran very hard into my seat. Instead of a simple apology, he gave me a mean angry stare. And throughout the flight, he and several flight crews were ignorant of passenger needs and requests. It reminded of the old days, when many of China Airlines flight crews had that we are holier than passengers mentality. I guess after all these years, nothing had changed.

### "a great atmosphere"
Frankfurt to Sydney via Taipei with China Airlines. The first leg from Frankfurt to Taipei was during the night and the cabin of the brand new 777, was perfectly illuminated in a warm color. Even the walls of the galleys were not grey or white but painted like bamboo wood. It was a great atmosphere. The bathrooms had a big size and were clean. On the second leg to Sydney, it was an older A330 and there was nothing special. But it was also a nice flight.

### "cabin crew were friendly"
Shanghai to Taipei with China Airlines. Very straight forward, for the price and timing you can't complain. The cabin crew were friendly and went the extra mile to speak English gaven that my Chinese is limted to 5 words! The seats were worn, TV very small, food seemed interesting (I wasn't hungry so I politely refused when offered). I was only on the flight for 1.5 hrs so it really didn't matter. The only inconvenience was the smell of the cooking from the galley. It was a bit of a nuisance however the friendliness of the cabin crew overwhelmed the smell. In all - for a cheap business class ticket it is good - plus it has a great benefit when checking in as you can use the Business class counters which I strongly recommend as the queues of people checking in to Eco on China Airlines is long!

### "everything was great"
Brisbane to Auckland return in business class. Everything was great, including the price. At the airport in Brisbane and Auckland, priority check-in and priority boarding worked well. The lounges at both airports were more than adequate with a range of food and drinks available. On arrival at both airports our bags were already on the carousel when we arrived, and we had passed through immigration quickly using the e-passports. Both flights were on time, the seats were comfy, there was a decent selection of new release movies to watch with noise cancelling headsets, and the food and service was really good, particularly as these are short sectors. My champagne glass was kept topped up throughout both flights without me asking once! Pre-departure drinks and hot towels were offered in both directions, we were called by name throughout, and were thanked by the purser for flying with China Airlines as we were preparing to land. We have flown business class on a number of other airlines and were expecting to be underwhelmed, however we were left with nothing to complain about on these short flights across the ditch and for the low prices, we would happily fly with them again.

### "would travel China Airlines again"
This was my return flight from Sydney to Auckland. Check-in at Sydney Airport was very easy with no queue at all. When I got to the gate, I was delighted to see that the aircraft had arrived from Taipei on time, so everything was looking good for an on-time departure from Sydney to Auckland. Alas, things didn't go that way from then on. They were having problems refuelling the aircraft, and our departure time kept getting pushed further back. We eventually took off 80 minutes late, and didn't make up time enroute. A330 was newer with a larger seat-back screen and a more comfortable seat. I ordered a gluten-free meal and that looked to be better than the regular meal. The crew were efficient, and spoke very good English. Considering the low price I paid for this flight, I would travel on China Airlines again.

### "satisfactory short flight"
This was my first time trying China Airlines for the short 3-hour flight between Auckland and Sydney. China Airlines seems to have a problem with being on time, and this flight was delayed a little, but made up the time in the air. I had checked in online, but didn't see the empty Internet Check-in line until after I had waited in the regular line for about 15 minutes to check-in. The aircraft was one of the older A330s. The leg-room was quite tight, and the seat-back screen was small. There was a good selection of movies and TV shows to watch though. I ordered a Gluten-Free Meal and it looked better than the main meal being given to others. The crew were friendly and had very good English. Overall, a perfectly satisfactory short flight, timed at a very convenient time for me, and at a great price.

### "very annoyed with CI"
Taipei to Sydney. I arrived at the airport a lot earlier prior to departure as Taipei Airport is notoriously busy around night time and that Taipei is hub to CI. Went to service desk as no one was manning check-in desk 4. The lady gave me a cold-shoulder and simply said check in hadn't opened for the flight. Only after wandering around the check in area then I discovered Skyteam Priority and Business Class check in area and they were happy to check me in. Confusions then arose as I thought being a Qantas Gold Member booked on a QF code flight I was entitled to Gold Member extra baggage allowance. I then ended up paying 13kg in excess bag. The story didn't end there. Upon stepping into the plane, I was upset to see that CI had allocated a regional configured A330 to my flight. The seat did not recline to a comfortable position to lounge or to sleep! So much for paying to fly in Business Class! The seat pitch was so terrible and the cabin temperature was so too hot despite having mentioned to the crew. My flight was delayed and my bags didn't make it to QF145. No communication regarding the delay. CI lost my bags from my flight to Taipei on 5 Oct on CI52 as well. Very, very annoyed with CI.

### "really amazing experience"
Auckland to Osaka via Sydney/Taipei. This was a really amazing experience. I must admit I had never flown with this airline before and was a little apprehensive, but I am very happy I did. Not only were they cheaper than my home airline by a substantial amount, but the food was better and the aircraft itself was certainly on par. The staff were polite and I would find it hard to fault the trip - and this was a long trip. I did the same route on the way back and again this was a very enjoyable experience. Again the staff were polite and helpful, the food was good and the entertainment certainly adequate. Thanks for the great trip.

### "everything seemed unorganised"
Sydney to Auckland. Everything seemed unorganised. Passengers in front of us and behind us were moved because couples wanted to sit together and they were seated separately. A large proportion of us had no headsets for inflight entertainment. These were only handed out approximately 20 minutes into the flight with passengers, including us, asking 2-3 times for headsets. We also couldn't get the sub titles off our screen. The inflight meal left a strong odour throughout the cabin.

### "their seats are small"
I flew with this airline on my last trip from Kuala Lumpur to Vancouver via Taipei. The advice I can give is for tall people book the emergency exits seats as their seats are small. For a 12 hour flight that was definitely very tight and exhausting. The movies selection wasn't that fancy but the picture and sound quality was bad. Their screen are so annoying very difficult to navigate around. Cabin staff was very attentive and pleasant though.

### "pleasantly surprised on all levels"
San Francisco to Bali via Taipei with China Airlines. Initially had some doubts about booking with China Airlines but I was pleasantly surprised with their service on all levels. Plane from SFO to Taipei was clean and comfortable. The second leg to Bali however the plane had definite signs of wear and tear. Entertainment on the plane was great. Would fly again.

### "everything looks old"
Taipei to Amsterdam via Bangkok. I flew twice this year with China Airlines, once in business and one in economy, the aircraft is the oldest. Everything looks old. Old seats even in Business class. The check in ground staff in Taipei is very kind but non initiave. The lounge in Terminal 1 is amazing, one of the best lounge, food, beverage, ambiance. The boarding is quite efficient specially for SkyPriority. The seat is ok but looks old, entertaiment screen is not good and the earphone is very uncomfortable. Good service on board, food ok, beverage ok for economy. I think for a national carrier should be better.

### "most uncomfortable seats"
I chose China Airlines because of their nonstop flights between Tokyo Narita and Honolulu, the fact that they are part of Skyteam, and because their business class fare was more than a $1000USD cheaper than their partner, Delta. The service onboard was wonderful and attentive. The food going was very good, on the return mediocre. The seats are not lie-flat. They are the most uncomfortable seats I have ridden in quite a while. They aircraft is very old and dated and doesn't have that Asian carrier newness or niceness at all (although their new A350s are supposed to be going to Europe). The AVOD was less than exciting but had enough to distractions to occupy me for the 7.5-hour flights each way. I would consider flying them again in the future if the aircraft were different or renovated.

### "Staff friendly and professional"
Taipei to Okinawa RT. Flight was on time, and I was upgraded to Business Class for this one-hour flight. Planes used are old 747s, but not that big of a deal as the flight is so short. Staff was friendly and professional. The only negatives were the lounges and food on board. China Airlines lounge in Taoyuan's T2 serves processed cheese cut into triangles. Quite pathetic. They really need to up their game. Lounge in Naha is a small shared lounge full of crying babies. Food on board is a savory wrap served in foil from a bag.

### "found the seats to be very comfortable"
Having flown with US airlines multiple times, I flew China Airlines once and was more than impressed. I was pretty lucky to be able to fly on an almost brand new aircraft from Shanghai to Taipei. The cabin interior was very fancy. Despite getting a middle seat, I still found the seats to be very comfortable, and am certain that I would have a great experience if I were to fly with them on a long haul journey. The food was not bad for airplane food, but still you can't really expect much from an economy class meal with any airline.

### "a horrible flight"
Flew Denpasar to Vancouver via Taipei. Old, old plane for a transpacific flight. Packed to bursting. On way out, we were seated in row 47, which I discovered was more cramped than other parts of the plane, which were already tight, as there is a huge service bar area in the middle of the aircraft. Smell of food almost constant, the back and forth of a huge number of flight attendants, put us in the worse spot on the plane. When we got to Taipei, we had a 5 hour layover, but there was no one available at the service desk to tell us where to go. Eventually, we just followed some folks, hoping we were on the right path. On the return, I asked at Denpasar, to change our seat allocations - no, could not be done except once in Taipei. Flight was 1 hour late departing Denpasar, so when I tried to change our seats, the attendants said it was impossible. For a 10.5 hour flight, we struggled. Plane delayed, again, by an hour for take-off. Once we were beginning the ascent, a fire alarm in the service area went off and continued until long past cruising altitude, as no one seemed to know how to turn it off. Not inspiring confidence. Then the service. The aisles are so narrow at this part of the plane that we are necessarily "involved" in all service activity in and out of the service bay and it is constant. I'm 5'6" and my knees hit the seat in front. If you put your seat back to sleep, your knees go forward. When we got to Taipei on the first leg home, running an hour or more late for our subsequent flight, the attendant at the gate was yelling where to go, in Chinese, of course. So we tried to ask where to go - "I just told you follow the people" - he yells. It was a horrible flight.

### "great service, excellent value"
Sydney to Auckland with China Airlines. This is my 4th trip with CI52/51 over the Tasman. Booked ticket 2 days before flying and received special fare of $300AUD return. Excellent value - 30kg bag, food, drinks, entertainment, seat assignment included, mobile check-in and dedicated bag drop - no waiting. Flight was full, left on time and service began swiftly and efficient. Arrived on time but delayed 20 mins while waiting for gate in Auckland. Return flight was also full, great service, excellent value.

### "great customer service"
Taipei to Hong Kong with China Airlines. The flight was 2 hours delayed but I was lucky enough to get upgraded to business class. The captain announced that due to the Hong Kong air traffic control, we need to stay on the ground at least 2 hours and wait for the further instruction. All the cabin attendants were very patient and polite. The cabin manager kept apologizing to me. The meal was served on the ground which was cool and not something I've ever experienced before. Overall, everything went well even though it became a late night arrival. Great customer service.

### "very smooth flight"
Taipei to Bangkok with China Airlines. I'm a frequent flyer. I was very lucky to fly the newest aircraft B777-300ER with special Boeing livery. Cabin manager came to greet me as usual. The inside of the aircraft was very clean and new. The Premium Economy seat was comfortable. The flight attendants were very polite and nice. A very smooth flight.

### "ground staff are rude"
Los Angeles to Penang via Taipei. I am a passenger on wheelchair. When I was on transit at TPE airport, after waiting for more than 3.5 hours, I asked the ground staff if they can wheel me to the boarding gate so that I can wait there. One of the ground staff young ladies told me that since I can still walk, I should walk there myself! When I complained about her attitude at the transit counter, the ground staff there told me that I can go and complain to the management about this. I'm not going to travel China Airlines anymore if I need to transit in Taipei. The ground staff are rude.

### "exquisite, attentive service"
Manila to Kansai via Taipei with China Airlines. Trip was a pair of 2 to 2.5 hour regional legs, both in the same aircraft. (There was a 3 day layover in Taipei between the legs.) Older style business seats, lie flat at angle, in 2-3-2 configuration on a 747-400, perfectly sufficient for 2 short daytime flights. Exquisite, attentive service. Stir fry black pepper beef, glass noodles, and a glass of Chianti Classico was probably above average, but this was only a 2 hour flight.

### "excellent onboard service"
This was my first time flying China Airlines from Singapore to Surabaya and return the next day. I was very impressed by the excellent onboard service, provided by the friendly and welcoming cabin crew. Both flights were on time, check in process was smooth. There was only one meal option on this fifth freedom flight but it was delicious. The cabin crews served with a smile. Overall I enjoyed these flights and will fly with them again soon.

### "surprised with the service"
Manila to Tokyo Narita via Taipei with China Airlines, and I was surprised with the service, type of aircraft used and the Value for money. They served hot meals and they also have inflight entertainment. What can you ask for a real value for money? Service was very good going to Taiwan and to Narita. Food was not that good, though. Overall, if i have to decide between a budget airline vs China airlines, I would choose China airlines.

### "nothing to wow about"
Taipei to Tokyo Haneda. Boarding smooth and well organised. Aircraft definitely showed its age with old looking interior. Tiny personal touch screen, so tiny it's really hard to watch movies. Average inflight entertainment selection. Meal was your typical aircraft meal, you eat it because it's there. Nothing to wow about. Seating space very small. I'm only 5'5" and my knees were against the front seat back. Crew friendly and attentive. Great that China Airlines is getting the new B777 fleet and product, but a complete revitalising is needed.

### "far better than it used to be"
Taipei to Bangkok with China Airlines was a late night flight on the first sector of the Taipei to Amsterdam service. All good, comfortable, easy flight, pleasant and efficient crew. It is far better than it used to be : this was my first China Airlines flight in about a decade and the improvement is very evident. Skyteam membership makes this airline a good choice on some sectors.

### "crew are proactive and polite"
China Airlines offers exceptionally cheap price on this route, which involves one plane change in their Taipei hub, connection is about an hour which is sufficient. Interior design was nothing outstanding, but was still comfortable. Welcome drinks (2 juices and water) plus hot towel and newspaper delivered with a smile. The quality of dinner they serve is quite good, with 3 choices, Japanese style dinner is excellent, followed by the standard fare like cakes and ice cream. Cabin crew are proactive and polite. AVOD offers a fair choice, not that there's a lot, but sufficient for short to medium haul flights, with noise canceling headset. I find the remote control a bit chunky and awkward to use with the twisted cords. Unfortunately, due to bad weather condition in the first leg, I missed the 2nd leg, the staff gladly arranged a hotel for the night and escorted me wth a car to get back. The way they look after transit passengers are reasonable and helpful. Despite the delay due to weather, I think China Airlines will become more competitive with the whole new image and brand concept. My confidence in them has been earned back.

### "totally unaccountable staff"
On a recent round trip in East Asia I flew with four different airlines but China Airlines was by far the worst, starting from the lousy "food" served to nothing but delays and to the total absence of proactive communication. The flight from Hong Kong to Taipei was delayed two hours with staff not bothering to provide any explanation. Of course I missed my connecting flight to Okinawa where my hotel for the night was already booked and prepaid at a no-refund rate. Asked what they were going to do about that they first said I should try harder to get a refund from the hotel but as I insisted they suggested I lodge a refund claim to the airline. I checked and their forms are all in Chinese. They took me to the Taipei airport Novotel for the night and early on the next day rushed me back to board the morning flight whereby the hurry was unnecessary as this flight was delayed as well. I mentioned the form issue but they didn't react and disappeared. Overall, a bad experience and totally unaccountable staff. Never again.

### "the worst travel experience"
On April 4th I was to travel from Tokyo Narita to Honolulu with China Airlines. After two hours of the flight being postponed (with minimal communication,) we were boarded onto the flight. The cabin was over-heated and we were forced to sit on the plane for almost an hour with no communication as to why. The excessive heat was incredibly uncomfortable; everyone had taken off their jackets and started fanning themselves with the emergency card. Eventually they announced that tech issues had been fixed (tech issues we had never been told about,) and the flight would be cancelled being the Narita Airport curfew was 11:00PM (it was 11:02PM, if they had been 2 minutes quicker with everything we could have been to our destination 12 hours earlier.) Finally, we were escorted off the plane and forced to go through customs once again and then were given sleeping bags to sleep on the hard linoleum floor in the airport with bright florescent lighting. They let us know they would try and get us out as soon as possible, and then announced our flight wouldn’t be till 1:00PM. I am at the gate now (11:20AM, our flight is supposed to take of at 12:00PM) and the airline attendants announced that we are going to be experiencing yet another delay. This has been the worst travel experience in my life.

### "much better than Delta"
San Francisco to Taipei with China Airlines. Have not taken this airline across Pacific Ocean for many years. Although we flew in coach, the seat was comfortable for a trans-Pacific economy class. Services was good, much better than Delta coach we flew from Tokyo to Seattle on return. Flight attendants were polite and helpful. The plane was new and their three-seat family arrangement is genius. Safety record of this airline improved dramatically. Cabin crew are cognizant of safety requirements much more than 15 years ago. Flight entertainment system is more than enough, especially for those with Chinese language capability. Being a Sky Priority member, we zip thru check in line with no problem. Long lines of TSA security check at SFO airport was not fun.

### "seating was comfortable"
Auckland to Sydney with China Airlines was overall a positive experience with China Airlines, but there are some small kinks that need to be ironed out. The website is clunky and I could not get a boarding pass despite being able to check in online before the flight. In saying that, the check-in counter at Auckland International was fine - if not a bit slow, with some ground staff (in China Airlines uniform) idle and chatting amongst themselves, rather than serving customers in line. The flight was late around 1 hour for take-off but managed to arrive only 20 minutes late. Boarding, in spite of the lateness was relatively efficient. Unfortunately (fault of the airport staff more than the airline staff) the boarding times between the display and actual boarding time was inconsistent, creating a great deal of confusion. The flight itself redeemed the initial chaos. The plane was an old A330 but the seating was comfortable with decent legroom and width. The IFE screen was very small and resolution was poor, but it was surprisingly responsive to touch and there was a variety of latest movies available. While the IFE was available shortly after takeoff, the headphones weren't available until much later - this should have handed out before the flight. The crew was otherwise lovely - courteous and efficient. The meal, while on the small side, was tasty. The drink service was prompt and serving size was generous. For the price (by far the cheapest), it was a good flight and I would fly again.

### "outstanding service and comfort"
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Los Angeles with China Airlines. Outstanding service and comfort at one of the best prices for this route. From the ease of check in and priority screening at busy BKK to the attentive service and comfort in business class, China Airlines will be my first choice to SE Asia. I flew over to ICN on American first class and had a surly flight attendant the entire route. China Airlines exceeds American in detailed service and overall comfort. The food choices on CI were good and better than the food I was served on a JAL flight. The entertainment system was easy to use and there were several new movie options. But for me the most important factor was the comfort of the lie flat seat with adequate privacy. No stepping over someone to access the aisle. Bottom line - great price and excellent flight.

### "plane is extremely late"
I feel obliged to write a review of China Airlines. The airline itself is fine. The food is fine, the service is fine, the seats are fine. However, every single time I fly this airline it is late. I have flown the Taipei to Hong Kong route a number of times in the past six months, and every single time, at both ends of the journey, my plane is extremely late. It is frustrating to be told on a Friday night that your 7.40pm flight to Hong Kong is delayed three hours. It is even more frustrating to be told on the Sunday night that your flight back to Taipei is delayed 2.5 hours. In this particular case, the flight was over 3 hours late, instead of arriving at 10pm, I arrived at 2am. I will be flying Cathay Pacific from now on.

### "seat is a very good choice"
Taipei to Bangkok on China Airlines Boeing 777. Premium economy seat is a very good choice for short-haul alternative to business class. Good entertainment system, big table (but somehow strangely tilted), good noise-reduction headphone. A good enough seat, reclines, but not electrical. China Airlines food is edible, flight attendants quite good.

### "with lovely staff"
Christchurch to Melbourne with China Airlines. Awesome service with lovely staff and great food, movies and comfortable seats. Thank you very much for excellent service. I would definitely be using again. It was clean and well airconditioned. Value for money. Checking was great and no hassles.

### "it was a pleasant experience"
I took a chance and booked a China Airlines flight from Loa Angeles to Bangkok via Taipei, it was the lowest published fare offered by any carrier so I was a little apprehensive. I did not experience any negatives, it was a pleasant experience that I would do again. The food was most plentiful and I've never been fed so much by an airline, I was surprised at quantity and quality and was served with wine. LAX-TPE and return were both newer 777-300's and all nighters so the drink/snack offerings were kept to a minimum to respect sleeping passengers. FA's did a great job of keeping the cabin clean and take safety very seriously. For a 14 hour flight (LAX-TPE vv) it would have been nice to have more of an inflight movie selection, it's just a lot of flight time for such a limited selection. On the TPE - BKK and return an older aircraft (A330) were in use and like our earlier flights, food was exvellent. I found the seats on the newer 777's to be most uncomfortable while the seats on the A330's were softer. There is a transfer desk just as you walk out of the arriving gate with assistance and a smile. I wouldn't hesitate to book a flight on this carrier in the future, it was a most positive experience

### "cabin crew courteous"
China Airlines from Melbourne to Christchurch. Value for money, great food, cabin crew courteous, all services were included in the price so booking was easy, also for xmas was able to layby for a week so made it affordable.

### "needs to improve the product"
An old style business class product and mediocre service on this China Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Bangkok. A little disappointed in the product which was more akin to a premium economy offering than business class, but the cost of the ticket was reasonable so felt I received what I paid for. The old style seat only reclined and was not good for sleeping, and the IFE was very poor with only a small selection of movies, not helped by a small screen size. The meal service was efficient but quality of food poor. A pre-flight welcome drink was only offered on the return flight and the drinks service was sparse on both flights. The check-in was quick but I was not asked my seat preference and ended up in a seat which meant I was disturbed each time the person next to me got up. The Lounge at Amsterdam airport was KLM’s which is an airy space with plenty of seats, food and a bar. China Airlines needs to improve the product it offers on its Amsterdam flights before I book with them again, for now I will carry on using Emirates or Qatar Airways, both having a far superior Business product in comparison. The China Airlines website also needs an urgent upgrade in my opinion. It is also very dated and not easy to navigate. Their frequent flyer programme - Dynasty Flyer is also not explained well on the website.

### "happily fly again"
We flew with China Airlines for the first time over Christmas new year break from Brisbane to Auckland. We were pleasantly surprised, the check in service was exceptional. We asked to be upgraded to business and it was complimentary. The service in air was sufficient and seats comfortable. Meals fairly basic but catered for my dietary requests. Its not Qantas business class standard however we would happily fly again with them.

### "inflight service good"
Flew China Airlines 1st January from Taipei to Fukuoka. The inflight service was good and prompt by smiling FA. Individual movie screen as small, as ipad mini. The flight was good, cabin and toilet clean and well maintained. Will recommend flying with China Airlines.

### "service was good and prompt"
Flew 1 Dec, CI 752 from Singapore to Taipei. Full flight departed on time, service was good and prompt by smiling FA. New uniform looks smart for mature staff but makes the younger ones looks older. Individual movie screen as small as ipad mini. 9 Dec, CI751 from Taipei to Singapore. Boarding was chaotic. Flight departed late due to long queue to take off. Both flights were good, cabin and toilet clean and well maintained. Will recommend flying with China Airlines.

### "I would not recommend"
As a Paragon Status (highest tier) with China Airlines, I am extremely disappointed at the quality of service. On my outbound flight on 12/12/2015, I was greeted with cold shoulder by the flight attendant serving my section. With 2 young children with me, I request the flight attendant if she can offer me some in-flight toys so my children can be seated quietly before take-off. However, the first response the flight attendant offered me was "you didn't have it? and start to stare around our seats to see if we already received; it was extremely offending. Then she came back with 1 set of toy and claimed that they have ran out so my children would need to share, and sarcastically said "I don't know how to use this so you need to figure out". I then call for the purser and ask for explanation. After purser apologized, she then came back with 2 sets of in-flight toys. I was  extremely disappointed at the service attitude of the flight attendant who attended my section. On my return lag on 12/15/2015, after checking, I was only issued 3 lounge passes while I have my wife, 4 year-old daughter and a 3 year-old daughter. I then ask if can have another pass so I can bring all my children to the lounge. Since China Airlines utilizes contractors and only have 1 direct staff at the Singapore Changi Airport, for every inquiry I made, the contractor would need to stand up and walks few steps to the China Airlines representative to get her permission. Surprisingly, as an elite member of this airline, the China Airlines representative remain seated at her position and for every question asked, the contractor would need to walk back and forth to address this issue. The worse case even after I call the customer service hotline to report the situation, the service attitude did not change. And the only solution the hotline can offer me is that they will "report back to HQ" of the situation. Despite the horrible check-in experience with China Airlines, when I arrived at the Changi Airport Dnata Lounge (not operated by China Airlines), when I asked them if I can bring another child in, they said that since your son is so young, of course, we will allow you. This clearly showed the lack of professional courtesy and consideration of China-Airlines to its passengers. I would not recommend this airline.

### "general impression good overall"
Amsterdam to Bangkok with China Airlines. Pleasant check in by KLM. Aircraft not young but cabin and toilets spotlessly clean and well maintained. Appeared to be fully booked, cabin crew adequate, bright, smart and helpful,  speaking Thai. They regularly offered water/juice. Food and wine not outstanding or huge quantity but okay value for money, served effectively - the pre-booked meals came out first. Plastic cutlery but good quality. Entertainment- not a vast amount of audio on offer, range of styles good and well chosen but control system impenetrable and  difficult to operate. General impression good overall. Seat pitch minimal but no footrests restricting floor space so you can stretch out.

### "missed a bit of a personal touch"
Pretty nice medium-haul flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei. The crew on this flight were attentive and helpful, but a bit robotic and I have missed a bit of a personal touch. The seats were not ful flat, but for this route very comfy and spacious. The meal service were great with a good choice of asian and western style foods. Coffee service was very nice with a metal milk can and sugar box. At arrival in Taipei there was no priority line at immigration, so it tooks a long time to get landside.

### "crew very helpful"
China Airlines  from Amsterdam to Taipei via Bangkok with A340. I was positively surprised after this return trip. Despite the relatively older aircraft that they use on this route, it was a comfortable flight with good IFE and food. The crew on board were very helpful and service oriented.

### "hassle to arrange transit hotel"
New York JFK to Sydney via Taipei with China Airlines in economy. I select China Airlines because they always seem to have the cheapest fares on this route, probably because of the long 18 hour transit in Taipei. JFK to Taipei leg had a new Boeing 777-300ER which was quite nice with good IFE and reasonable comfort and room, even on a 95% full flight. One flight attendant made it quite clear that she would rather be somewhere else and detracted from the other crew. Always a hassle trying to arrange the transit hotel on arrival in Taipei as the transfer desk seem to know nothing about it, despite it clearly being in your booking. Not sure why they use a 3 star hotel (Taoyuan Hotel) 30 minutes from the airport for this purpose. Taipei to Sydney leg on much older A330 that was a full flight and fairly uncomfortable. Food was on par with other airlines. Would use again if they continue to have low fares.

### "seats were really comfortable"
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Taipei with China Airlines, and I was very impressed by the new Boeing 777 Business Class. The seats were really comfortable, you have so much space since the 1-2-1 configuration and lots of spare room for your travel utensils. The food was good, as well the inflight entertainment with a huge touch screen and a good range of new and old movies. The cabin crew was really friendly and helped with anything you needed. Would recommend for long haul flight between Asia and the USA.

### "very comfortable seat"
The China Airlines lounge in Taipei airport is very beautiful and comfortable. There was a short delay so I stayed a little bit longer. Pleasant flight from Taipei to Ningbo. Cabin crew did a very nice work. The meal was great and wine taste good. Very comfortable seat and great selection on the entertainment system.

### "bad communication"
Worst service, especially for China Airlines in Hong Kong. Due to Typhoon my flight was cancelled but instead of helping you get on another flight, they make you call and rebook. I understand its not their fault but as a business they should do their best to help you. A check in agent at Hong Kong China Airlines desk was rude and I waited 4 hours for them to find the luggage I checked in early the day before, she wouldnt call to check for me and just told me it will come when it comes. I stood in front of that desk after I was told 3 times to come back at certain times. Other staff there at least checked for me. After an hour wait, our call went through and we got a flight for the next day. Now I'm waiting for my flight back to LA and its been 3 hours. First I got the run around and was told the wrong gate and that the plane hasn't arrived. I went to eat and luckily decided to ask again because they said they were boarding and to hurry to another gate, the original gate I was at when they told us it was wrong. 3 hours and counting. This is the second time this has happened. Hong Kong China Airlines has the worst service, Taiwan service is better but 3 hours delay due to ground complications is ridiculous not to mention bad communication and the runaround.

### "a pleasant flying experience"
Hong Kong to Taipei with China Airlines. Check in procedures were smooth and window seat reserved okay. Just had enough time to take a coffee before boarding. In flight light meal was fine and movies were updated. I was allowed to carry 2 hand carries (one laptop) other than a checked-in baggage. Inflight service was friendly and appropriate. Baggage was on the carousel waiting for pick up as I went thru the immigration check point. A pleasant flying experience.

### "Cabin service was good"
Hong Kong to Taipei return with China Airlines. The flights were on time and no delay. Cabin service was good for both flights. On the trip from HKG-TPE, some passenger picked up wrong baggage which is my baggage, I contacted the China Airlines baggage counter and my baggage was found on 2 hours later. The service is good.

### "Worst experience ever"
I do not recommend flying with China Airlines. I arrived 8hrs late and they lost my bag. I was making this trip to coming back Bangkok to Madrid via Amsterdam. They do not give the two boarding pass that I needed when leaving Bangkok, and when I arrived to Amsterdam I cannot find anybody to assist, the check in was closed, so we have to take 2 flights later to arrive - and when we finally arrived the bags were lost. Worst experience ever.

### China Airlines customer review
China Airlines delayed flight by over 14 hours, which kept me at TPE over 15 hours. Prior to flight, I was notified of the delay and I attempted to call China Airlines telephone numbers in different countries so I could make a flight change to the next day and avoid the extreme layover in TPE. None of the phones were answered in any country. I tried using Expedia to contact China Airlines. They also attempted over six different locations but China Airlines do not answer the call. I finally gave up, flew to TPE, and stayed in the airport for 15 hours. I asked China Airlines to provide an overnight hotel in TPE, but they refused that request. This is totally unsatisfactory as a customer and in the future, I will make every effort to use another airline.

### China Airlines customer review
Always 1 hour late! I took 4 flights with them in August. The first second and third flights were 1.5 hours late. The last flight was 3 hours late with no explanation. If tardiness is an issue for you when flying, do not fly China Airlines

### China Airlines customer review
Originally our flight was on August 9th from Taipei to Hong Kong and connecting flight to Haikou via Dragonair. However due to the Typhoon it was not only chaotic at the airport but many of the flights were cancelled or delayed including ours. We let the ground staff know that this would be a problem as it meant we wouldn't be able to catch our connecting flight. They were extremely helpful and able to arrange for the 3 of us to fly directly from Taipei to Sanya instead. Very grateful that they managed to solve our problem efficiently.

### China Airlines customer review
Check in was fast and staff was helpful. The seat was narrow for a guy around 170 cm. However the recline angle was good to sleep. The cabin staff was nice and try to look after passengers during the flight. The food was fair,  but the quantity was enough for an adult. Overall, I enjoy this flight and it met my needs.

### China Airlines customer review
Shanghai Pudong-Taipei Taoyuan on brand new B777-300ER, ground service handled by China Eastern Airlines which was a disaster. Flight delayed 1.5hrs which is very normal in China. 3-4-3 layout of economy is so uncomfortable even for this short journey, normally airline put 3-3-3 layout such as SQ/CX/BR. Food is ok, only coffee and tea available, even no juice. AVOD is very good.

### China Airlines customer review
Traveled through Taipei one day after a typhoon, flight CI6. China Airline staff, normally on top of things, were flat-out paralyzed. Nobody was in charge, desks were barely staffed, flights were moved between gates w/o notice. Stewardesses complained they had been stuck 15-20 hours without any information as to what they were to do or when. Our plane was "delayed", then "cancelled", then "on time". We have no flight crew available". Suddenly there was a big rush to board the plane about 1.5 hrs after scheduled takeoff, then we sat at the gate for over 4 hours, "wait for more passengers. After having crammed every seat, the plane left the gate only to sit on the runway for another 1.5 hours. Finally got off. First meal was cold. Nobody could make any decision, they all milled around. Very poor crisis management, and utter failure to have a plan.

### China Airlines customer review
The services of China Airlines ground and cabin crew are good, staff are nice. The cabin seats were clean and comfortable and aircraft looked new. It provided variety movies for passengers. The cabin crew served drinks and hot meal. The flight departed on time and whole flight was stable and nice.

### China Airlines customer review
Not the first time I've flown China Airlines and I had mixed emotions about this particular trip. Departed from BKK-TPE-CTS and returning KIX-TPE-BKK. My family and I myself got upgraded to Business Class during the KIX-TPE sector which made it more comfortable for those 2.5 hrs. Meals were awesome but maybe a bit too spicy for and flight attendants were active. IFE and seats were pretty old but fine for short haul trip. The one thing to keep in mind when travelling with China Airlines is that delays are pretty common. All of my flights with them from the start have never been on time. BKK-TPE the flight was half-full but we still left BKK 45 minutes late. TPE-CTS, KIX-TPE, TPE-BKK ground handling became the reason for the delays. CI130 arrived CTS 45 minutes late. CI173 left KIX 30 minutes late and arrived TPE an hour late. CI65 left TPE/arrived BKK an hour late. CI has got to work on their on-time performance. Pick longer layovers (3-4 hrs) at TPE if you do have a connecting flight to avoid missing the flight or your luggage missing the connection.

### China Airlines customer review
I had a very mixed experience with CI. Firstly, checking in online went well and I was able to choose a good seat. However that's about where it ended as in the seats opposite me there were 3 young women who asked for alcohol at every opportunity and started abusing other passengers and the crew. To do the crew justice, half way through the night they decided this had gone on long enough and called more senior staff who refused them any more drinks and moved the people most affected and apologised to to the rest of us. I would have loved to move but the flight was full and I understand there is not much they could do and people just sometimes behave badly. I can't say the crew were unfriendly or rude. I would say though that the food was really not good at all. I asked for the rice dish for breakfast thinking it would be better than the alternative but I was not impressed and I was pleased I had taken some snacks on board with me. I also found the entertainment disappointing and could not get the sound loud enough to hear anything. Overall I would fly CI again but would just accept that the catering is not wonderful or would order a special meal

### China Airlines customer review
The flight was smooth, flight attendants were nice, seats are comfortable, food was very nice. There were no delays.

### China Airlines customer review
I was looking forward to trying CI on my next trip but ended up feeling a bit disappointed with the overall experience. All flights were full which meant no space to spread out. Greeted harshly when boarding, directed to seat. Aircraft was modern and clean. Seats quite close together. My knees were touching the seat in front of me, and I'm not tall. Crew rarely smiled, and didn't appear friendly or approachable. Food of decent quality for economy, drinks limited. Water was warm and served from strange plastic jugs, which makes me think we were drinking tank water. Service was rushed. Entertainment was of very good selection and easy to use. No drink or snack runs until breakfast served. No amenities however bathrooms kept clean. Crew friendlier on return flight but nothing above average. If the price is significantly cheaper it may be worth flying CI, otherwise I'd spend a bit more and fly with a different airline.

### China Airlines customer review
Left on time and arrived early on both flights! Inflight entertainment was good, food was your average plane food but nothing was nearly as bad as it was made out to be. My flights were significantly cheaper and I would fly with them again.

### China Airlines customer review
The seats are definitely not geared for Western heights and weights. My husband was tortured with no legroom for 13 hours. It was just not comfortable. Might be ok under 5 hour flights but for long distance travel its brutal. The staff were accommodating. Food was pretty bad and I actually didn't know what some of the items that were served. I left a lot. Not sure I'd fly this airline again because of the cramped uncomfortable seating. That's really all they have to offer.

### China Airlines customer review
I flew from Jakarta to JFK via Taipei where I changed planes. First time I was flying on China Airlines. The route to JFK had a short stop over in Hong Kong. Business class was not full. The business class seats from JKT to Taipei was okay. The plane (Taipei - JFK) was new and seat was comfortable. Flat reclining (almost). In flight entertainment was average. Flight attendants were attentive. One the return flight (JFK to Taipei) business flight was full and service was sketchy. Flight attendants did not seem to be able to understand English. They also "disappeared" after the first meal - i.e. just did not bother to check on needs or offer snacks. You needed to go to the kitchen and help yourself. Meals were average and quantity was small. Overall I flew because the business class deal was very good and it was good value for money. May probably do it again if the price differential remains.

### China Airlines customer review
Return flight Penang-Taipei in economy. Aircraft very old and aircon leaked no PTV seating uncomfortable food fair (a cooked meal). Cabin crew on outward flight fairly friendly but on return flight unfriendly. No flight information supplied. Flight only four hours plus so bearable.

### China Airlines customer review
MNL-TPE-SFO return. MNL-TPE on a new A330. Good service new plane poor food. 11 hour layover at TPE allowed family to explore Taipei prior to connecting flight and enjoy the local fare. TPE-SFO on a refurbished 747. Full flight and ticket class meant seating in the tail section with no USB port and a bumpy ride. Service below average with only one drink/water run after meals on this 12.5 hour flight. IFE above average to good. Returning from SFO used the same aircraft but this time seated in the midsection. USB port barely working and so was the underseat power. Meals small and barely edible. Service was friendly and prompt but again only one water run in the long haul flight. Took this flight only because the price was almost half of DL PR and OZ. If price point is the same then and only then will I consider flying CI again.

### China Airlines customer review
My first trip flying CI on a bargain fare to NRT. Great service on the ground and in the air. The cabin crew were friendly and worked hard on a very full flight. They would often check and clean the lavs even the Purser put on her gloves and went to work. Great meals and IFE. Seating was a little tight in the Y cabin but a very pleasant trip otherwise.

### China Airlines customer review
Feb 26 CI 584 PVG-KHH. Mar 10 CI 503 TPE-PVG. Flew on CI flights at least once every year for my last 36 years and I tried last month again on PVG-KHH and TPE-PVG. Everything was excellent. You find the crew to be sincere and try their very best to help at all times. A333 was used for the outbound flight full dinner was served although it was just a 1.45 hr flight and arrived on time. For my return flight I was on the special livery B744 and I discovered the cabin is pretty new. It is rare to see IFE was offer on flight between China and Taiwan in fact CI is one of the two airlines out of 10+ carriers serving cross strait having PTV on every single seats I am for sure to fly CI again for my next trip to Taiwan and looking forward to try their new B777 business class next time.

### China Airlines customer review
Travelled JFK-TPE TPE-ICN TPE-XMN and finally back to NYC. It was a month long vacation & those flights definitely made it more pleasant. The lounge at Jfk was well stocked with food & drinks. Plenty of staff member s to clean after the moving crowd. On board the flight attendants were all smiles. No request was too much for them. 3 meals served from JFK to TPE are delicious and fresh & the drink menu extensive. The lounge at TPE airport is one of the best in my opinion. I recommend China Airlines highly.

### China Airlines customer review
SUB-SIN-SUB in Business Class. Aircraft: A330-300 (2-2-2). Check-in at both airports was fast. All departures and arrivals were on time. Seat is comfortable with decent legroom. Food had a better taste on the outbound flight and drinks filled up frequently. Flight Attendants were charming and friendly. Unfortunately I did not use the IFE so could not comment on it. For those who want to enjoy Business Class at affordable price (almost 50% cheaper than its competitor) I recommend you to try it and personally I do not hesitate to fly CI Business Class again in the future.

### China Airlines customer review
I have flown for several years on China airlines LA Taipei Shanghai (3-4 times per year) and always flew first class. This time however they informed me that they have introduced the new 777-300's and they have Business Premium. They assured me it is "Better than the old first class". They convinced me so I booked. I am now en-route and have hit my first obstacle in LAX. Even though I booked as high of a class offered on my flight I cannot access the First Class lounge. Quite frankly I've put in over 25 years of the Asian travel and during my lay- overs the First Class lounges are much nicer than the Business class lounges. I am now at the Taipei airport Business Lounge and the food and amenities are spare. I have been told they do not offer bottled water. Sounds like I'm complaining I'm really not. Just disappointed. The fare that I paid was in the same ball park of what I've always paid for their First Class and when I have longer lay overs it's nice to have the amenities (food etc.) especially when your paying first class fare. It's clear that China Airlines can get many more of the Premium Business class seats in the airplane but I think they need to understand what their customers seeking First Class ( and are willing to pay for it) expect. The seating compartments on the plane were fine however the food and service was not like First Class. Unfortunately it looks like my China Airlines days are over and it's on to another airline that has the total first class package.

### China Airlines customer review
I have been traveling between Asia and North America for more than a decade more than half those flights have been on China Airlines because of the access to LAX and SFO. This last trip I returned to SFO for nine days before returning to Saigon. Firstly the food service is timely after takeoff but being served a meal suitable for a baby. Two tiny scallops and rice with four green beans The next meal service isn't available for 10.5 hours. Make sure to bring snack food for yourself. Secondly the airline asked me to check my carry on bag at the gate which I did. At gate 9 in SFO the man there took my bag and said you're all set to go. Yep I was but my bag wasn't. Have no idea where it is. All because it was over by a kilo. Doubt I'll be flying China again for a very long time.

CI0004 from Taipei to San Francisco old B747 with narrow leg space I am not tall just 170cm. The screen is terrible small in size and cannot see much on the screen even though I adjusted the light to maximum. The appearance of the crew was nice however the service was below average only serving drinking water for 2 times during the entire 11 hours flight. No more China Airlines for the flight which longer than 4 hours.

Overall OK for the money spent would do it again.

### China Airlines customer review
Christchurch to Sydney return on business class. It is a very poor business class offering from this airline. Purchased a promotional fare from their website to try this airline while they operate this route over the summer season. Few days later I was contacted by the airline asking for more money as the fare on the website (which we have seen advertised for at least three weeks) was apparently incorrect. Of course I refused to pay more and after few emails and phone calls we came to a resolution but the whole situation was just badly handled. On the return flight from Sydney check-in agent was outright rude telling us we are not given any lounge access as we paid cheap tickets. In general it was a bad experience from the airline which is trying to break into this route. Never again!

### China Airlines customer review
I was flying from Taipei to Toronto with a connection in LAX. The policy is that you must re-check baggage when entering the US and flying out to another destination i.e. Canada. With a 2 hr 45 minute layover in LA we figured we'd have enough time to grab our baggage and re-check into Air Canada. Our flight left over an hour late because China Airlines decided to accept passengers from another flight to make more money. We arrived 45 minutes late in LAX and by the time we got our baggage and ran to the other terminal we were late and they would not let us check- in. We brought this to the attention of China Airlines staff but they put us on another flight to Toronto that was 7 hours later! Gave as $100 each discount on our next China Airlines flight. Staff were unhelpful and the entertainment computers were directly underneath the center seats of the plane so I could only stick one foot through the bottom of the seat at a time. It was the worst experience flying I've had and warn everyone that considers traveling with China Airlines to book with someone else.

### China Airlines customer review
I fly CI for my annual trip to Bangkok from Calgary. It's an interline route using Westjet from YYC to YVR and China Airlines for YVR-TPE-BKK and return. They continue to use the old tired A343 for YVR-TPE lag which is showing its age although preferable to me due to the 2-4-2 configuration as I tend to pick a window seat. I am finding their service is going downhill over the last four years especially for inflight entertainment and the meal. The meal from YVR was stale and inedible so is the breakfast on the TPE-BKK and TPE-YVR leg. Brand new B777-300ER for TPE-BKK which had great cabin and IFE interface. Fair value for money but service could be a lot better for the money.

### China Airlines customer review
I booked a round-trip flight from LAX to Saigon last October. The flight from LAX was delayed 2 hours. Before landing in Taipei for a connecting flight to Saigon the flight Captain announced Connecting flight to be 12.30pm instead of 10.30am as scheduled. After we landed there were no China Airlines staff members to be found. Our group of passengers finally stumbled upon a security officer who directed us to China Airlines' counter on a separate floor. Long lines and only 2 overworked employees helping us to get the connecting flight. Contrary to the flight crew announcements the connecting flight was scheduled at 2.30pm not 12.30 as announced. Adding insult to the injury China Airlines gave us a meal ticket in Taiwanese Dollars worth about $3USD not even enough for a hamburger. Due to this poor service I would never fly China again.

### China Airlines customer review
All of my flights were pretty much on time and my luggage didn't get lost but my experience was that this airline offers no frills. Unfriendly staff with poor English skills. Tired cabins and dirty toilets. Poor quality food and such a dated and difficult entertainment system. I bought a cheap ticket so I guess I got what I paid for!

### China Airlines customer review
SIN-TPE-SIN. Both ways it was an older A330 - seats were a torture for a 185cm guy like me. My knees hurt being constantly pressed against the seat in front so I had to stay in very uncomfy position and/or stand up frequently. IFE was horrible being an old plane what you get is a not more than 6-7" screen and no matter how you play with brightness and or screen position you won't see much. Resorted to music in the end. Games were slightly newer. Cabin crew were nice but their English command was poor. We all know that you get what you pay for but we also know that nowadays in airlines world that is not entirely true. There are very good and cheap carriers operating in Asia. China Airlines is not among these in my opinion. At least not on Singapore-Taipei route.

### China Airlines customer review
NRT-TPE-BKK - Have not flew CI for sometime and was bit dubious. What an improvement CI has made. Both on the A330. The flight were on time good selection of inflight entertainment. Food was okay for economy and better than KLM's Business Class intercontinental. The thing I love about CI was the option to view take off and landing real time on your screen. I cannot fault the trip and service whatsoever.

### China Airlines customer review
Flew LAX-TPE-BKK and return. The most important thing to know about CI (as of Sept ’14) is that if you purchase your economy ticket through an online service (like Kayak or Expedia) the airlines policy prohibits you from getting a seat assignment prior to day of departure. Unfortunately online ticket purchasers don't find this out until after they've plunked down big bucks on a non-refundable ticket. This lack of a passengers capability to select a seat in advance (not to mention the lack of transparency) is reason enough for you to take your transpacific business to another carrier. The planes used on the transpacific segments of my trip had a tight economy seating configuration with little legroom. It felt pretty much like flying a domestic carrier in the US. Food general service and in-seat entertainment was on par with other airlines on this route. Flight attendants were pleasant. The one benefit of flying CI is that transfer to connecting flights at Taipei's Taoyuan airport is smooth enough to accommodate fairly tight connections time-wise. (This is not the case in Beijing or even Hong Kong). Unless you get an incredible deal on your ticket and you don't care where you sit on a long flight I'd give CI a pass and book with someone else.

### China Airlines customer review
Flew KIX-TPE-BNE return trip at the beginning of September 2014. Seats on the TPE-BNE leg is new. The ones I flew specifically were B18360 on the outbound journey and B18358 on the inbound journey. The interior of the these birds is upgraded compared to the other A333 in their fleet. The seat recline was 170 degrees and the feeling was very similar to the business class seats on the Garuda A333 fleet. Food on the outbound leg was fabulous. I do travel regularly but it was one of the best meals that I have ever had on a plane. Sleeping was no problem as the seat reclines to 170 degrees or more. The food on the return leg was lower quality but what can you expect on an inbound flight? The seats were the same as the ones going there and we did have a wonderful night's rest. To sum it up I am very satisfied with my travel experience and I look forward to my next flight on C class with CI!

We have flown eight segments with China Air over the last few years. The last flight was last week. Never on any flight have we left the gate on time. On the last segment Taipei to Bangkok. The steward said they had to shut down the video system. I was watching a movie. Around 45 minutes later I asked them to reboot the system or turn it on. They could not do it. Several stewards tried to no success. The food was served and the trays were left on the tray stand for about 45 minutes. So anyone wanting to go to the bathroom had a problem. They had bright lighting on well into the night. overall a poor flight. One seat we had was broken you could feel it in you back anytime you moved it would make a loud noise. Very inconvenient for us with all the late leaving flights and quick transfers. We tried this airline over United where we really felt the service and planes were very substandard. I really do not see much difference.

CI916 and CI8 July 31. I traveled from Hong Kong to LA. The check-in service is not as good as I expected. She confirmed me in an exit seat but I found I was in the last-narrow row seat. The only thing I was not satisfied with was the seat space. China Airlines does not give as much as leg and feet space as other economy's for the last row passengers. The food - ok. The cabin - ok. Maybe I will choose China Airlines again but I will not recommend to my friends and families.

Flew LAX-TPE-HAN in refurbished 747 to Taipei and A330 to Hanoi. I was very impressed with the 747 as the seats in economy were very comfortable even for the entire 14 hour flight. The crew were very friendly and happy to help. The food was okay but its airplane food so what can one expect. The flight to Hanoi was almost empty so we were upgraded to premium economy. We were served an entire lunch on this flight even though it was only 3 hours. Then flew from HCM-TPE-LAX. 747 on both flights however the plane for the TPE-LAX flight was older. The entertainment system was outdated and barely worked. The seats were also uncomfortable and left me sore after the first 5 hours. I would recommend China Airlines great value for your money and they seem to be taking passenger comfort into consideration with their updates.

Flew from Brisbane to Honolulu (stopover in Taipei and Tokyo) on CI53/54 and CI17/18. All flights on A330-300 aircraft (Brisbane flights had upgraded interiors). Have flown with CI previously but was impressed with the high standard of food on all trips. Drinks so-so with less variety of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and cabin crew were reluctant to give the entire can of soft drink unless requested (and had to ask other colleagues for permission to do so). That being said service was great for the most part and most flights departed on time with minimal delay. As an end note I submitted positive feedback to the CI website and received a phone call from the Brisbane office within 2 days thanking me and asking if I had any further comments. Appears to be a company that listens to its customers and I will choose to fly with them again in the future.

Flew Taipei to Tokyo on 23 June. At the boarding gate the scanner wasn't working well to scan my boarding pass and the passenger in front of me but was overall smooth and didn't cause too much trouble. Inflight service was okay and crew members were friendly. Food was good and a lot of choices for films and music for a 3 hour flight. The cabin pursers announcement was difficult to follow. The most strange thing was that on leaving the aircraft there was no one to greet you at the door and in fact no crew member could be seen from my cabin.

AMS-BKK-AMS on CI late June 2014. I chose CI because of the great fare and the early arrival in BKK and AMS on the return flight. CI uses the A343-300 on this route. May not be the most modern plane but it has a very comfortable seating lay-out even when full like my 2 flights with ample legroom. Flights departed a little late but arrived ahead of schedule. Meals and service by the crew were much better than expected. The IFE is basic compared to Emirates but still provided for a good few hours of entertainment with an interesting non-Hollywood selection. All in all 2 fine flights for a great price. I will use this airline again.

### China Airlines customer review
On board service is absolutely minimal. Unfriendly staff no trace of hospitality at all. Entertainment: all music is Chinese only! No classical music at all (but Chinese traditional music in abundance). Inflight magazine in Chinese language (with some minimal English words added). Cleanliness is rather low overall impression: very low. The good things: flights were smooth and we felt safe. Punctuality was good.

I flew Frankfurt-Beijing-Guiyang and return and I was completely satisfied. The first flight was on-time. In Frankfurt Air China flies from the Lufthansa gate which is quite conveniently located. Entertainment was good but it can be boring for people who speak neither Chinese nor English. The flight attendants were very friendly the food was good supply of drinks after request at night. Flight landed on-time in Beijing but we needed to take a bus to the terminal. Connecting flight was on time again but operated by Shandong Airlines which was also okay. On the way back both Air China flights were punctual leaving but due to high air traffic (not Air China's fault) we were delayed for about 90 min at Beijing Airport. During the waiting time drinks were available (self- service only) The cabin crew was friendly and we encountered some turbulence so service was suspended quite often. There were too many announcements telling passengers to stay at their seats! Self-service in the galley was okay even alcoholic beverages were included. Flight attendants didn't mind people going into the kitchen and getting food and drinks by themselves.

Terrible service all around will not fly with them again. Our flight did not even land in Beijing because of a "weather" condition but when I checked the weather at the time it was sunny. No other explanations were given. Upon landing in Beijing I obviously missed my connective flight to Harbin. They offered us a hotel and a good 3 course meal but instead we were transported to a rural area with only a cup noodle.

Beijing to Shanghai Business Class June 21. Despite both ATC and weather delays (neither of which were the carriers fault) we had a really good experience. Flight was operated by an A330 which was internationally configured as it was continuing to Melbourne. Very comfortable seating good entertainment including camera's and maps and a very decent snack. Crew were efficient and kind although not overly warm and they were inconsistent in their enforcement of safety regulations i.e. Cell phones on and seat backs up. The female crews seemed hesitant to enforce correct behavior of Chinese men. All in all a very good professional experience.

I did not have any service related problems with air china on return flights SYD-PEK-STO. Slight flight changes were emailed well in advance. I requested special meals which I got on all legs. Crew were very courteous. Some of the PEK-STO have inflight personal entertainment now but the selection is very poor and worst of all it is the same on all legs. Better to have your tablet or laptop pre loaded. If you are tall like me then don't choose a window seat. These seats and the middle two seats in the centre rows have a large black media box that sits where your left leg should - very uncomfortable on overnight flights. Overall a good experience minus any frills.

I flew from Osaka to Ho Chi Minh with a connection in Beijing. The first flight from Japan was ok although staff were quite unfriendly and check in was really slow they took about 15 minutes looking at my passport and visa. The second flight was an hour delayed just boarding - no announcements were made for the reason of the delay. Once we boarded we waited another hour and a half on the plane. Again no announcements were made as to why we were waiting for at least the first hour and no crew were in sight we just sat there. Food was pretty mediocre and when offered a choice of chicken or seafood they then said there was no chicken and I had to wait. It took about 15 minutes for them to bring the food out after serving everyone else and when I asked for it after about ten minutes the crew member just laughed and said you will have to wait. Small uncomfortable seats. However no issues with baggage being transferred which was good and flight itself was pretty smooth. All in all not a great experience and one of the worst airlines I have flown with.

My return flight from Changsha to Beijing was delayed 3 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight to LAX. No explanation apology or help to make the LAX flight. I was flying business class at great expense. This kind of treatment was most unexpected. I missed the flight by only 5 minutes and had I received some help at the gate I could have made it. Other airlines make the effort. Going back to rebook was very difficult with no help offered. On the later return flight to LAX the flight attendants were very poor for a business class seat but they did allow Chinese to move into open business class seats but when I asked to move to first class for my problems I was rudely denied by the international manager. The food and drink for business class was both cheap and poorly offered compared to other airlines business class. Last time I use this airline.

Flew LAX to PEK. Other reviews had made me resigned to a bad experience but I was pleasantly surprised. I would rate my flight much more highly than the three flights I had with Hainan Airlines in 2012. Checking in I was happy that the agent could change my allocated window seat to an aisle seat. It turned out that I was given one of only six double seats on the Boeing 777-300 ER! My troublesome right leg was therefore free to move around. The airplane was newish and very clean. All the flight attendants were female young and smartly turned out. While not particularly friendly and making little attempt to socialize with the passengers they were polite and at least one was always available near the midship galley which had tea water juice and cookies for snacking. Seats were fairly comfortable with the usual minimal recline feature. Food was another surprise: tasty chicken and rice or shrimps and rice; but the "tomato" juice was atrocious. Late in the flight the faucet in one of the toilets disintegrated. I alerted a flight attendant who examined it gave up on fixing it and then walked away! I wrote a warning sign in English and asked a more senior attendant to write a Chinese version. She did so and agreed with me that locking the door was a good idea. That was a sound decision because I later observed several fellow passengers waiting to use the toilet oblivious to the clearly posted message! The choice of inflight entertainment was wide and the maps were the best I have seen on an airplane.

Lhasa-Kathmandu. May 10 2014. Inexplicably instead of flying directly from Lhasa to Kathmandu which would be a diagonal flight path with Mount Everest to the left of the plane we flew due south then due west and so I saw Everest from my window seat on the right of the plane. I had asked to change my seat to the left window but was told that this was not possible so I was glad that I got to see Everest after all! Otherwise an OK flight. Nothing remarkably good or bad.

HKG-PEK-ARN / ARN-PEK-HKG. Surprisingly no delays at all. Flight attendants were impolite. Lack of ground staff support at ARN. Seats were narrow and really uncomfortable. Economical with respect to fare.

Flew on May 3rd LHR-PEK-NRT and return May 11th/12th NRT-PEK-LGW. Flight CA938 LHR-PEK on 777-300ER excellent service from boarding to departure at Beijing. Boarded and departed on-time at LHR and meals and drinks service in Economy class were excellent and the cabin crew were very efficient and polite throughout. After disembarking at Beijing and transferring through the transfer formalities in 20 minutes then boarded CA421 from PEK to NRT. A smaller aircraft A320 but still fantastic service and the added bonus of a full meal for this 3.5 hr flight. Once again cabin crew attentive and efficient and thoroughly enjoyable flight to arrive at Narita on time. Return flights were equally impressive firstly an evening flight on CA168 from NRT to PEK on 737-800. Another good inflight meal and drinks and service impeccable despite aircraft virtually full of Chinese tourists returning to Beijing. Arrived in Beijing at 9.45pm and after an even quicker transfer at Beijing boarded flight CA861 to London Gatwick (LGW). A330-200ER. A rather strange departure time of 01.35 was slightly tempered by plane preparation which meant an 03.00 departure however once on board this aircraft the service was excellent once again. Inflight meals and drinks perfect and service once again impeccable arrived at LGW at 07.52 feeling very refreshed. Air China are in my opinion are excellent and are excellent for value. It does help to speak some Chinese Mandarin as I can as the Cabin Crew do respond very well if you at least make some effort.

Flew from YVR-PEK-DEL and return. Like most of us I had absolutely no idea how bad Air China was and so booked the tickets solely because of the low prices. Well after reading the dreadful reviews here I was terrified to go aboard but was pleasantly surprised that the flight was not half as bad. Well the food wasn't all that great but it was bearable. No hot drinks but there were plenty of cold ones in the galley. To be honest the seats were pretty comfortable and plenty of pillows and blankets were provided. I was kind of expecting them to not serve too many meals so was well prepared with my own. The crew was quite helpful they weren't smiling much but weren't rude as such. I guess their lack of English makes them sound rude they don't do it on purpose. Surprisingly Beijing airport staff was great too I was with my 3 yr old daughter and they helped me at every point. To be honest the service was quite good considering the low tickets fare. When you travel with a child you hardly get time to watch any movies so I can't really comment on that but overall the flight was good. Wouldn't mind traveling with them again if the airfare is low.

Short domestic flight CA1832 from Shanghai to Beijing on a A330 was great. On time. Brand new aircraft comfortable seats in economy class on board service with warm meal (even with the choice of two different ones) and good choice of non-alcoholic beverages. Cabin crew very attentive and worked as a well-trained team. As a LH frequent traveller I had never experienced such high level of service on some of the European flights. Simply great experience. Will definitely use them on a next trip from Europe to China.

Flew round trip HKG-PEK-LAX and IAH-PEK-HKG with them. First plane was delayed from Hong Kong to Beijing which caused us to miss the connecting flight. Ground crew were rude and incompetent in re-booking our ticket with long queues also just to find anyone. Cabin service was lacking in both legs of the flight with cold food. Beijing Airport itself is chaotic and terrible: long line just for transferring flight (through immigration) lack of any decent food option and shopping lack of any crew for customer service when asking for directions. On return trip I got a middle seat in 77W seat is very cramped and unpleasant even for not a big guy (5'7" tall). Entertainment is very lacking in the AVOD system. Food is OK but some parts just plain look uneatable. Cabin crew are OK on the first leg of the flight with the normal service. The second leg is in the old 747-400 plane. I got the typical emotionless cabin crew with lack of any service after the normal drink/meal service. When asking for just a cup of water I got a reply of "do it yourself". Despite their relative cheaper price never again for the bad experience. They have a long way to go.

### China Airlines customer review
Unpleasant crew it's like you are talking to a statue. The seats were dirty (fresh sticky stains) and pillows and blanket missing - asked them twice. Seats are small and the box for the media is occupying the quarter of the space for your feet (half if its broken). They didn't want us to move on an other seat reserved for the crew (10 free seats never occupied). My wife was pregnant and I told them but they don't care. Asked for some water (twice) never came - I think they got angry at us somehow. On the way back we asked for a larger seat (emergency exit) but they put us in the middle between two persons. I am not a difficult person but this company is just inhuman.

Currently waiting in Air China lounge in Beijing where the food is terrible and all the supposed "cold" drinks are warm. Flight has been delayed twice. Due to depart at 4.45pm now departing 8.40 no announcement this after a 3 hour delay yesterday traveling from Guangzhou where they loaded us and pushed back from the gate and sat there for 3 hours due to bad weather. Surely with all the technology available they know this before boarding us? I was traveling in business class which is far below most other airlines standards. Never again.

CDG-PEK-TYOTYO-PEK-CDG. Flight Attendants behave very rudely to passengers have very poor English skills (even the most common words) barking at passengers when they "order" them to do something (put your seat in first position when landing for example). Don't expect them to bring you something after the meal was served (water for example). No choice with meals but despite that no smile and they almost throw the meal at your face. The transfer in Beijing was the most unpleasant and horrible experience I've experienced. We had 1 hour only from our flight CDG-PEK to the other flight PEK-TYO. After passing the corridor when exiting the first plane (CDG-PEK) an attendant was present to ask whether we have a transfer. As we said "Tokyo in 1 hour' she said Hurry hurry go! and pointed the direction where to go. But a huge queue of passengers was our destination and among them some with a transfer for a flight 3 or 4 hours later. No Airport staffwas present to direct us. We had to apologize to other people to come before them as our flight was leaving in 30 minutes as time was passing and the officer did not dare to accelerate the process of immigration control (for a transit flight!). This queue was a joke as people in transfer had to face immigration control and security control just like they trip would stop in Beijing. All that passenger had already passed these different controls in the country of their departure. Then we had to run for 500 m with our bags to the gate were a bus was patiently waiting for us. TYO-PEK-CDG looked like the same except that we had 2 hours for the transfer. Always security and immigration control with unpleasant and unhelpful officers sure of the power they have to annoy cistomers. One officer even took the external hard drive of my friend in a suspicious way (he had all his pictures in it) making him almost believe that he would confiscate it. I cannot believe this airline takes part of Star Alliance with ANA Lufthansa and others. Air China in 3 words : Incompetence Inefficiency carelessness.

Beijing to LAX and a number of minor run-ins that I didn't expect. The first annoyance was when I asked for a second bottle of water. The flight attendant replied with: “Didn't I give you one earlier?” The first bottle I received when I boarded the plane and I asked for the second bottle after I'd eaten my meal. Rather than bringing me a new bottle she proceeded to fill up my empty water bottle. My second complaint was the breakfast. I slept past the breakfast time. When the flight attendant gave my breakfast after I woke up it was cold dim sum. The flight attendant did not bother to heat up my food. My last occurred when I was about to fill out the customs declaration; I was given a choice between English and Chinese on the flight to Beijing but the flight attendant made an assumption and gave me the Chinese one without asking. I've lived in the US for 30 years and would have preferred an English one over simplified Chinese. I never expected to face this kind of attitude and service from a first class flight attendant.

Sydney to Rome return. My tv screen did not work. Asked staff several times could I move and they just kept resetting it. Majority of the consoles did not work properly. Very poor movie and food choice. But the worst part by far was then they added a 3rd destination without our knowledge. Major confusion increased because it was a domestic leg added. So had to check out of the airport and back in at both Beijing and Shangai. I tried calling their complaints department but conveniently you can only email and its been 2 weeks and no response.

LAX to Taipei in Business Class and Taipei-LAX in Economy. Renovated 747's both ways which was a vast improvement over the older product. Food and wine selection in Business was excellent and the staff were very attentive. Food was good enough for Economy but plentiful again the staff was excellent. The only thing that needs a slight improvement is the IFE I wish they have more selections for recent movies.

SFO-PEK-MNL. The flights were better than expected based on past reviews I read. The food was fine and the kid's meal provided for my son was much appreciated. The FA's were not overly friendly but polite and efficient. I particularly liked the beverages made available in the galley. It was nice to be able to get up and get something to drink when needed. The FA's kept it well stocked with water soda tea and juices. The inflight entertainment could have been better. The movie & TV options in English were limited and aged. However they still gave us something to do during the flight. The provided headsets were not very good but we brought our own for the long trip so it wasn't a problem for us. Overall I was satisfied with Air China and appreciate the money saved when compared to other airline prices. For the value I would consider flying with them again.

Booked Business for my wife and myself from Sydney to Beijing Beijing - Munich Paris - Shanghai and Shanghai - Sydney utilizing the 72 hours Visa free stopover in Beijing and Shanghai. We did the first leg from SYD-PEK. Flight is on Airbus A330-200. Seat is comfortable and it's genuinely a Flatbed 180 degrees with an ample leg space comfortable pillow and quilt. Meals were served hot with a choice of Western and Chinese Dishes. The TV is large with plenty of movies. Cabin Crews were friendly and attentive although some did not speak English well they understood our requests. The Restroom was cleaned and wiped each time a passenger used it. Plane left on- time. On Arrival in Beijing the plane stopped on the Tarmac and a small bus was waiting just for the Business Class Passengers. After the arrival gate 2 ground staff members were holding our names and took our cabin bags and guided us to the Immigration Express Lane then to pick up our luggage. Air China is now our preferred Airline.

My flight from JFK New York to Beijing China was 14 hours long. I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of my requested dietary preference was excellent. The meal times also were appreciated because the cabin crew requested all passengers move their seats back to the upright position. I am 6 feet tall and when the seats recline the passenger in front of me ended up crushing my knees. The bathrooms were top notch. On a long flight I expected them to be a disaster but they were always clean. The inflight entertainment was good and kept my kids busy when they were not eating or sleeping. Compared to other long flights I have been on before Air China better than I expected.

San Francisco - Manila via Taipei. Boarding was smooth I was assigned a seat with bulkhead directly in front of me limited leg room however no seats getting tilted back on me. The TV and dinner tray are built into the seat in this arrangement so the seat is even narrower than normal. I am a fairly average size guy and I was cramped due to the reduced width. The service is OK served two meals offered water twice coffee or teas once and received a warm towel once. The movies were fairly new although I watched foreign movies with Chinese subtitles didn't understand a thing. The flight to Manila was uneventful the transfer in Taipei is really smooth. The return flight was quite more eventful. Boarded only to find my assigned seat was already be used by a young child apparently the ticketing agents changed the seat assignment by simply writing it on the boarding pass. I was one of the last to board so I just stood in the galley and kept fingers crossed for possible upgrade. No upgrade however I did get an aisle seat so win-win family stayed together and I was in a better seat. All things considered given the price I was able to book this flight for the overall friendliness of the staff the quality of the food and the choices of entertainment I would say "Do it take a chance be adventurous.

DEL-PEK-SFO. After great service at Delhi departure check-in it was downhill for the next 2 flights. None of the cabin crew spoke a word of English or Hindi they were rude and unhelpful. Food was still frozen coffee and tea were not served without a hassle. I booked for convenience of arrival time and it was a mistake. I fly to India once a year and have flown many Asian airlines and they are excellent. When you have 21 hours on a plane you really do expect movie choices more recent than 1960's. I could deal with bad food and no entertainment in a comfortable seat but they should give the ones they have back to the bus they got them from.

Hong Kong to London Heathrow connecting in Beijing. Multiple schedule changes prior to departure. Flight from Hong Kong to Beijing delayed - no explanation or apology. Flight form Beijing to London delayed by over an hour - no explanation or apology. Cabin crew had little and in some cases no English skills and few if any manners. Wine ran out half way through the meal service and tea and coffee was not offered afterwards. Films in English language consisted mostly of black and white offerings from the 1950s. Checked in luggage did not arrive at Heathrow and it took 3 days for it to be sent to my home. There is nothing good to say about this airline - its the worst national carrier I have ever travelled with.

CI007 and CI0018 on 4/12 and 4/18. It had been about 6-8 yrs since the last time I went on China Airlines. I was impressed with the improvements made to the entertainment system kept me busy the entire time besides sleeping there are over a hundred movies and my two kids were kept busy. The food has improved a lot. I love the teriyaki chicken rice dish and the porridge was pretty good too. On our way to Hawaii we had a layover in Japan. The only thing I think they need to improve on is the attentiveness of staff on board their uniform is so outdated.

Flew from London Gatwick to Tokyo via Beijing. My 2 teenagers were a little apprehensive after reading some negative reviews but were pleasantly surprised by the experience. Modern aircraft to Beijing with inflight entertainment and a Boeing 777 to Tokyo with no entertainment console but only a 3 hour flight. All flights left on time and the transfer through Beijing was relatively painless as all flights in same terminal. Meals were very good for airline fodder and plenty of them along with water and drinks. Staff were well turned out and efficient but as pointed out in another review quite emotionless. A couple of smiles wouldn't go amiss! My only gripe was the complexity of the inflight entertainment remote control. Took a bit of working out and couldn't get my daughters to work on the outbound journey. However as travelling in economy goes I would say Air China were one of my better experiences and would be happy to use them again.

I have never seen such a dirty plane: tray with dirt ceiling splashed with food and coffee food splashed on side wall floor dirty seat pocket full of debris inside toilet not cleaned sink and out of stock. The food was awful. The worst part of journey were the FAs. They were very rude no smile no English. They did the minimum during the whole flight. Never again.

AKL-SYD A330 full flight so lucky to be given 7B excellent seat. Staff professional friendly and hospitable. Plane was spotless AVOD was inline with most carriers if some what limited in new release films and TV. Food was surprisingly excellent with an Asian and western option. I took the western option beef and potatoes which was delicious. Somewhat small portions though. Drinks were plentiful. For a NZ to SYD option I would definitely recommend this flight.

PEK-IAH April 2014. First Class 777/300. Flight departure time 3.00. My wife and I were at the gate 15 minutes before boarding and the pushing had already started. There was no sign for a first class line so both lines were 20 passengers long. When I finally got the attention of the gate agent she pointed to the front of a line. After boarding we took our seats 1L and 2L. We were served a drink and told we would be the only two in FC. Here is where it starts to go downhill fast. After take off we were served dinner. When I checked the menu on their web site it was supposed to be Australian Beef. They didn't know anything about that but they had a beef meal the only Western choice. OK I'll try it. Soup was cold so I sent it back and it came back cold. Now for the beef. It looked like pot roast with cold lumpy gravy. I sent it back and it came back exactly the same. Dessert was something round the size of a half dollar. Tasteless. Red wine was supposed to be French but I think it was Chinese brand Great Wall Wine. Not drinkable. The AVOD wasn't bad so I watched a movie and tried to sleep. Should be easy with only 2 of us in FC. Then crew moved to empty seats to sleep. Just when I thought I would fall asleep the FA's started cooking in the FC galley. Banging dishes and glasses. The cooking smell went on for several hours. Arrival in Houston was a welcome relief. Priority tagged bags hit the belt about 10 minutes after the first bag. Air China has a long way to go to compete in the International market. They actually make United look great. I was using miles for this flight. I would have been more upset if I had paid for it. When I checked their web site FC one way PEK-IAH was $13.000. Hard to believe they operate this flight with limited English FA's and horrible food as a United codeshare.

HKG-YVR via PEK and vv. I had been on some domestic flights with a number of Chinese carriers none of which were anything to write home about. The flight out of HKG was an A321 and left on time. The e-ticket stated we would be served refreshments but they served a full lunch accompanied by a few beers. Water runs followed until we reached PEK in good time for the connection to YVR. Transit visa desk and security were relatively painless although you cant help notice the overstaffing which we will put down to 'security'! The trans-pacific flights were more than simply acceptable especially as the flights weren't full. I like the seating layout of the A330 which allows for better sleeping as there is no third person wanting to get into the aisle for whatever reason. The final flight from PEK to HKG was actually operated by an Air Macau aircraft and crew. An 321 and it got us safely back to HKG on time. Good trip with CA overall and I would certainly not hesitate to use them again if the price is right. FAs emotionless but weren't rude!

I booked a return trip from London to Manila via Beijing due to the flight price and we had a stopover for 2 days in Beijing. Having read some comments I was not expecting the most comfortable flight. However I was pleasantly surprised. All our flights were on time and the planes were clean and the seats were comfortable. The inflight entertainment was ok on the London - Beijing route as there was a good selection of films / programmes. The only negative points of our flights were the boarding of the plane at Heathrow which could have been organised better and the quality of some of the food could be improved. The staff could have also provided more drinks for a long flight. However overall this was a good value for money experience.

### China Airlines customer review
I often fly between Houston and Beijing on Air China's nonstop flights 995 and 996. Overall I like their service. Aircraft's are new and clean. Flight attendants provide good service. The food is not bad as airplane cuisine goes. On a recent flight from Houston to Beijing we were 2 hours late departing Houston. The aircraft had pushed back more or less on time (shortly after 1am) but then we taxied out into the darkness and just sat. We sat and sat and sat some more. Eventually a tow truck came out hooked up to the aircraft and pushed it back a few feet. Then the tow truck pulled the aircraft forward a few feet. Then pushed it back. Then pulled it forward. This went on for the longest time. There was no explanation given by the pilot. No comments given by the flight attendants. It eventually became clear that the tow truck was getting the plane turned around. Apparently the pilot had taxied the aircraft into some kind of dead-end where we were trapped and could not turn around without the help of the tow truck and the spotters. Once the plane was turned around we taxied out to the proper runway and finally took off. The flight crew disabled the flight progress display. Maybe they thought that would prevent anyone from noticing that we were two hours behind schedule. There were no apologies or even an acknowledgement that anything had gone wrong. The lack of transparency and honesty with their customers cost Air China dearly in my opinion of them. From conversations among passengers after we landed in Beijing I was clearly not alone in feeling disgusted about being treated by Air China as if I were blind and stupid.

I was a bit hesitant due to mixed reviews of this airline . I traveled from Sydney to Beijing return and was very happy with the airline. There seemed to be great leg room and the food was really good especially comparing it to the food I ate while in China which was a very low standard much to my disappointment. There was a good choice on the inflight entertainment but don't travel at night as the Chinese nationals on this flight kept up the talking and noise through out the wee hours of the morning making sleep impossible something I have not found travelling to other countries. They sprayed the flight on the way back into Sydney with some sort of insect spray which is something I have not encountered before but maybe this happens on all airlines from China? It would be a problem if you were sensitive to chemicals.

Business class from PEK to BKK was a solid flight but I'd suggest eating before you board. The food had an odd aroma as did the damp hand towels that were kindly offered before the meal. The champagne was okay although it was served in a thimble sized glass the fruit was sweet and the rice was positively offensive. How can rice be bad? Not too sure what was wrong with it but it wasn't edible. The flight attendants were observant and wanting to please but everything was done without any smiles. Perhaps that's a cultural thing. Bathrooms were spotless as was the plane. The seats were super comfortable perhaps more comfortable than United Global First seats apart from the slightly restricted foot space. It was interesting that they didn't offer seat back monitors but they did offer individual iPads. The lounge was comfortable and offered limited food selections. Apart from the dismal food and the lack of entertainment Air China provides a very good product.

Moscow-PEK-HKG in business class. First time on CA biz class. Was a bit hesitant due to very different reviews here. Have to say that I was pleasantly surprised about the whole experience. New biz product is great. One of the most comfortable biz seats ever experienced. comfortable in any sleeping position. Some airlines compromise in terms of width or length of seat not CA. Only negative is the lack of a screen on Moscow-PEK route. CA provides tablet but unfortunately mostly Asian/Chinese movies. Food is decent so is service - friendly but not overly attentive. Would definitely fly them again if price is competitive.

I flew YVR-PEK-MNL and return in March 2014. The airline was better than I expected. The check-in was excellent in Vancouver and Manila fast and efficient. All aircraft's left and arrived on time. The food was good but not excellent. Cabin service was okay the only downside was the staff never smiled. The entertainment was also good. All in all when the low price of the trip is considered the trip was good. I would recommend Air China.

### China Airlines customer review
Flew Sep 2013 LAX-PEK-BKK. I’d chosen Air China strictly on price and was a little apprehensive. However everything from check-in on was up to international travel standards. The flight was no better or worse than other transpacific trips I'd taken in recent years on more highly regarded carriers. Food was OK and in-flight service was just fine. The coach seats were considerably more comfy than those on the Cathay Pacific flight I'd taken a year earlier. Because it is very geared to Chinese travelers I could see why someone might find the in-flight entertainment lacking. Available English language movie selection was a bit dated and odd and included a fair number of Westerns from the 50’s and 60’s. While flying CA is not bad at all transiting in the Beijing airport is another matter entirely. Before proceeding on to the connecting flight we queued up in a pretty long line for the thinly staffed Chinese immigration desk to stamp us into China. We were then channelled into the airports general security line for re-entry into the airports departure gate area. Very frustrating and very time consuming. I'd be reluctant to take any flight where there is a transfer in PEK. If you have a tight connection you are not going to make it. Bottom line: if the ticket price is attractive and there was ample time between connecting flights in PEK I would not hesitate to fly CA again.

Just returned March 11 from Beijing to New York. The plane was brand new and although it was a 14 hour flight my husband (6 ft 2) and I were very comfortable. Flight attendants were friendly and if one didn't know English very well they would find another attendant to help. Lots of food wine and beer served then during the night it was self serve for cold drinks and snacks. Few lineups for the bathroom. Smooth flight from New York to Beijing then we flew 5 days later to Shanghai. Returned to Beijing airport 3 days later and flew back to New York JFK. Beijing airport is huge but we had no problem getting around and checking in for all flights. Great value for the money.

Economy return trip from UK to Manila via Beijing. Overall we were very impressed and it is on a par with other airlines. All flights were on time and none were full to capacity. The food was standard although no hot drinks served. All cabin crew were very helpful. We could not check-in online (machine not working) and had difficulty with the automatic machines at Heathrow which accepted only one of our passports. The queues at the check in at Manilla on the return flight were extensive and although not vast numbers were flying we were still waiting in line for about an hour as so few check-in kiosks open. Beijing is a very large airport but times passing through security etc is very slow. One lady (by herself) was operating the X-Ray machine and she was also manually checking everything in the hand luggage she wanted to query. She was very thorough but it caused long delays. We had only just enough time to get our connection (final boarding) - which was 90 minutes. On the outward flight we had 8 hours to kill at Beijing Airport. In the evening the shops seem to shut but we did find some recliner chairs which afforded us the opportunity for rest.

Recently flew LHR-PEK-HKG and return. Transfers at Beijing were a joke worst organisation I have ever seen with many people missing their connections. Knowing the tight schedule luggage was not loaded onto the LHR flight meaning people like me who pushed to the front of the queue had no luggage on arrival. Staff at Beijing were rude uncooperative and didn't seem to care about the situation.

LHR-PEK Boeing 777. All in all a superb flight starting with access to the Singapore Airlines First Class lounge at Heathrow. On board the cabin was immaculate and the suites in First very private; the flight attendant was attentive and while there was some small language issues she was extremely accommodating and ensured a fine trip. The food was good but not great the wines fine and there was a good selection of movies on the IFE system. All in all a product that I highly recommend and will happily travel with Air China in the future.

Feb 10 return on 28th. CA986 and CA179 for the flights out and CA180 and CA985 for the return. Held in the plane on the tarmac for 5 hours while repairs were made. Old plane still had ash trays. Customer service was horrible but that could be a cultural issue. Multiple complications arrived late in China missed connecting flight to the Philippines. Coming back was a little better with a nicer plane and a little better customer service. Still had complications on the return flight and issues still unresolved by Air China. Overall in price I saved $200 per ticket but I would rather pay $200 more and avoid all the misfortunes of this journey with using Air China.

TPE-Koror return in business. Both flights on time. Plane packed both ways. Service was fine. I wish they would ditch serving the main course of a business-class meal in what looks like a coffee filter. Planes didn't have AVOD. Return flight showed a film about the Nazis (not exactly the most cheery thing to see coming back from vacation) and the menu offered a German sausage dish-simply bizarre. There is no lounge in Koror-they give you a coupon for a drink and some potato chips at a broom-closet-sized bar.

CI 0031 YVR to TPE 22 Feb 2014. At check-in they weigh your carry on and if your carry on is over 7 kg you they ask you to comply and tag your bag. You are then marked for a re-check during boarding expect someone to come and grab your bag impolitely of course and re-weigh your bag during boarding. Computers and duty free items apparently works on different laws of physics on China Airlines. You are not allowed to carry more than 7 kg of carry on because of safety concerns. But 7 kg of carry on + 5 kg of duty free are ok. After boarding I sat in my seat to find it smelt the seat in front of me the magazine safety brochure etc were smeared in dirt. The entertainment was not very good no new movies at all. The subtitles are in Chinese only. Food was bad just like other airlines. I'm not a picky eater but there wasn't enough of it in China Airlines. Service: I asked for another drink and the stewardess gave me an annoyed look and comes back a moment later and dropped a can of pop in front of me. Plane looked old and outdated and had definitely not being cleaned thoroughly. The only saving grace of this flight was the fact that the seat next to me was empty. I'm dreading my return flight now.

Delta flight from ATL arrived late in LAX so I missed a flight to Narita. Agent booked me on a China Airlines flight to Taipei and then a follow on flight to BKK. The aircraft appeared to be brand new inside and everything worked well. The entertainment package was up to date and varied. The cabin crew were very attentive throughout the long flight. I especially liked the reverse boarding for economy class as it went quicker with less standing around waiting for people to hide their carry on baggage. The landings were absolute the smoothest I have ever experienced.

I flew from Stockholm Arlanda to Wuhan China with a transit in Beijing. It was an 8 hour flight from Stockholm to Beijing. The flight crew had a rather bad manner towards economy class customers the crew was impatient spoke terrible English and speak Chinese directly to customers. They don't serve wine until it's time to eat. I was sitting only two rows away from a couple who brought their two young kids one of which cried for over 4 hours during the flight. Not single staff member showed up to comfort the baby. Air china lost my luggage in Beijing while I made it to Wuhan. I have to fly again to another city in two days without luggage I guess.

I flew from PEK to LAX in Business class on the newer aircraft and seat was basically lie flat. No issues with that flight. Check-in time was much nicer at 7pm since not at 7am or earlier like USA based airlines. On the way back I was from SFO to PEK on an older 747 but I asked for row 83 at the gate (they block it since it is an exit row) and I got it. I still love the peace and quiet afforded to the upstairs passenger by the 747. This is since the economy and crying babies are one level lower. Only a few passengers up there so I had a flight attendant pretty much to myself. Got all the drinks I desired and a double meal of the Salmon. It was so flavorful. The entertainment system truly needs to be like Cathay Pacific as right now it is just not enough movies that are in English and newer. The best part is they did a few announcements at the beginning of the flight and then remained quiet for the rest pretty much. I wish the entertainment system had an ability to not break-off for PA in a language that was not your own. Overall I would say Air china ok for business class. My next trip might be in their Economy and I bet I will not be as happy.

### China Airlines customer review
New York to PEK to Chengdu. Plane was clean and attendants were all friendly and polite. I found the food surprisingly good for "airline food". While I was in the economy class I never felt like my needs were unimportant. Some attendants did not speak English well. But they certainly did their best and always smiled and figured out what I was asking or needed and I must say their English is far better than my "Chinese". Good job Air China I hope to fly with you again.

### China Airlines customer review
Frankfurt-Beijing-Singapore and back. Flights on time and relatively cheap. No hello and no goodbye no thank you and no please from the crew. I asked for a glass of wine but was told that they only open the bottle with the food. My neighbor wanted a third glass of wine and was told he had enough. No spirits in economy. I eat just about anything and I have never really had reason to complain about airline food before but just the smell of the food was awful. Food was bland and servings were small. They had drinks like juice in the kitchen for passengers to help themselves. Our 4 year old daughter didn't get any special attention. The cabin crew didn't smile and it felt like you are a burden to them. Inflight Entertainment had a small choice of bad movies. On one leg there were problems with the sound. Annoying announcements throughout the flight. The seatbelt sign was switched on throughout all flights.

Flew from Hong Kong to Beijing on 2 January 2014. Really clean and nice aircraft. The Airbus 321 looked dirty but smelt like it came straight from the factory. The crew on this flight were excellent! They spoke English really well and were very friendly and service minded. As for the seats they were like any other standard economy seat but with great legroom. For lunch they served chicken or beef. I had the chicken which was good. Not the best food but it was okay for the 3.5 hr flight. We took of on time and landed on time despite leaving Hong Kong during the morning rush hour. I highly recommend Air China!

### China Airlines customer review
They changed my flight schedule more than 5 times prior to the flight date. After my initial outbound flight from London Heathrow I wasn't too upset. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the hospitality and the fact that I had in-flight entertainment for both the 9-hour and 4-hour flights. However on the inbound flight back to London I was extremely disappointed with the fact that there wasn't any in-flight entertainment after being pleasantly surprised during the outbound. The connecting flight was scheduled much too early and the logistics in Beijing Airport meant that we had to be specifically rushed through. I was initially worried that my luggage would not be able to make the transfer but after the hour's delay I was hopeful! In the end my luggage got left in Beijing and after arriving on a Friday my luggage got to me on Sunday. Overall the seats were alright but not quite right either - other airlines like Qatar are better. The food was not bad but the drinks did not have enough variety. The hospitality was very good actually which was a surprise to everyone who asked!

Sydney to Shanghai return overall it's worth the money (relatively cheaper than others) food is edible plane is quite new toilets clean throughout the flight and seats are wide enough for average height passengers. Only concern is the staff service I did not see anyone smile throughout the entire flight.

Vancouver to Beijing really needed to upgrade their cabin entertainment systems. The controls were dirty and buttons was unresponsive. Their food was awful. All of my baggage was delayed during the round trip. Never flying Air China again.

### China Airlines customer review
SYD-PEK-LHR return. 1st and last trip with Air China. Hostess handed out glass of champagne/orange on boarding but walked past me 3 times until I finally had to stop her and ask for a drink. Ordered Chinese food from SYD-PEK totally tasteless and no salt/pepper to add. Same awful food PEK-LHR. Only time we saw the stewardesses was when they brought water/juice round which was not often. Their English was very poor no smiles announcements very unclear. 7.5hr wait in PEK. Beijing airport very short on shops/facilities. Food in Air China lounge at PEK just about edible. After having to get someone from reception to unlock shower I was very disappointed. Had to go through security again at PEK even though in transit. Had Chinese option again from LHR-PEK and that was actually passable but none of the meals were bigger/better than other airline economy airlines. Air China has to use Alliance lounge at LHR which had very tasty/varied food/drinks. On the return trip LHR-SYD I chose Western for the last meal (breakfast) and that was quite nice. Had 5 hr. wait at Beijing. I was able to have a Baileys drink from SYD-LHR but when I asked for one from LHR-SYD was told it was only available to 1st class passengers. The only good thing was the fully flat beds try to book row 11 as it's the only one where the feet part does not narrow to the width of 2 feet side by side! Very limited choice of Western movies. The seatbelt signs were left on even when there was no turbulence and staff did not encourage people to open the window shades even in daylight. I have flown Business class to London with Singapore Airlines and Thai and am afraid that Air China is by far the worst airline I've ever flown with.

We travelled from UK to Australia via Beijing and visa versa. Staff were quite stand offish and didn't speak English very well a smile would have been nice. 2 meals supplied were very poor and no English option available. Meals were very basic and no snacks offered. Drinks only offered during meals and they only came round a few times with water. Entertainment was poor very dated films. Beijing airport: staff had no idea what they were doing and caused complete chaos amongst passengers. We passed through baggage control which took 2 hrs only to walk down 24 steps to go through the same thing again. Then transferred onto plane to Australia and service was exactly the same. Return was the same treatment it was -9 in Beijing and hence it was also -9 in the airport the air- conditioning was full blast. The flight to the UK was slightly better only because the staff spoke a little more English. We had to close the blinds even though it was a daytime flight. All in all our Air China experience was not a good one.

### China Airlines customer review
Travelled Air China as it was the cheapest at the time flight on time and no delays first leg of journey on A340 not too bad and food reasonable but second leg Shanghai to Sydney plane was old food inedible and cold. No drinks provided other than with meals air hostesses command of English poor. On the way back food was awful on both legs full of very badly behaved children asked for an alcoholic drink and was told could only have one with dinner entertainment system antiquated no really up to date movies too many Chinese ones and very temperamental system. Would be worth paying extra for a better trip as on a long haul flight its needed.

### China Airlines customer review
China Airlines uses old- seats (no flat-bed) flights for European-Asian routes. Compare with other airlines seats offered such as Eva air Korean Air Cathay Pacific Air France Japan Airlines are much better CI flights really need serious improvement. The seat in front of you can recline on you. This makes the whole journey very uncomfortable: difficult to work and difficult to get out of your seat. Food is good but the service is very slow. You don't receive hot towels in the morning and no hot drinks were offered while breakfast being served. Lounges at Taipei and Bangkok airports are not very clean. The receptionists are friendly enough but the lounges are not exactly business-friendly. If you have connection flights luggage cannot be guaranteed on arrival. Even when travelling on Business Class no compensation is offered for late arrival of luggage. Flight attendants are generally friendly. Entertainment channels are inadequate and the TV screen is very out-dated.

### China Airlines customer review
I have flown Air China Business class for many years. I have always found the staff more than courteous and helpful. On seating was handed a juice/wine and hot towel. This is a night flight. No problem getting coffee/tea at any time. Eat western food and is generally ok. Could do with some improvement. Staff always coming back to see if you need more coffee/tea. Inflight entertainment fair. Seats fold to straight bed and very comfortable. Got a good nights sleep. Staff very helpful in morning with coffee before breakfast.

Shanghai-Frankfurt Jan 13th. Plane left on time. Flight attendant kind and helpful. Got an aisle seat in the first row of the cabin and had plenty of space for my legs. That were the good points. English announcements spoken with an incomprehensible beginner's accent. Movie choice again very violence dominated mostly Chinese audio quality very low. Food was a shame in comparison to even average Chinese cuisine. Though it was a day time flight blinds had to be closed all day. Got a headache having to read all day by means of the dim seat lighting. Worst was the cabin temperature (my watch showed between 16° and 18°). Almost everybody put on his/her coat which sadly did not prevent from the AC which streamed constantly down to the aisle seats. Entered the plane in a sound condition left it with heavy sinus irritations. This decreases the value for money very much. I would not recommend.

CA998 YVR to PEK then CA969 to SIN then back again a few weeks later. These flights employ well-used A330s. Flights smooth and on time. However my economy seat was narrow and very poorly padded - little better than a city bus. The entertainment system was old and tired with a limited selection of movies. Flight attendants did the basics but disappeared for long periods. They did however keep the toilets very clean. Loading procedures were amateur and chaotic as if the ground staff were improvising. Individual staff were OK but as a group they lacked management. This unpleasantness was magnified by the loading at Beijing. For reasons unknown the SIN and YVR flights had to load using buses out to the tarmac (when gates at the main terminal were obviously available). This is not appropriate for a large plane at capacity. Beijing airport is a liability as a hub. It is very large dreary inefficient and immersed in a toxic smog. Moreover as a passenger in international transit I had to go through a passport check and then through the general security check. This gobbled up most of the 3 hours I had for my connection which I almost missed. Unacceptable. Avoid this place.

### China Airlines customer review
Frankfurt-Shanghai Economy. Had got a window seat by online check in. Flight started dead on time plane was very clean seats comfortable (A330). As the movie choice was mainly violence-bound and absurdly censored/cut I resigned on spoiling my eyes on those low-quality monitors and slept through most of the flight. Food was quite okay service efficient and kind. In comparison to the price this was a rather good value for money rate.

My first time using CI. My trip was CGK-TPE-LAX-TPE-CGK. TPE-LAX plane was an old 747 which is still un- refurbished among others. The seats were not as comfortable as the refurbished ones and the AVOD screen was so small! LAX-TPE plane was the refurbished one. The seats were comfortable enough for long haul flights and the AVOD screen was the new one. CGK-TPE and TPE-CGK planes were comfortable to me and the stewardesses English fluency was good even though I still kept asking for something in Mandarin. The food was awful to me compared to another Asian carriers. The movies and music selections on Fantasy Sky were not as much as the others. I'd say CI is NOT uncomfortable for long-haul flights and didn't worth it enough for me.

### China Airlines customer review
YVR-TPE-DEL return. First time travelling with China Airlines and it turned out to be a fairly good experience. 747-400 between YVR and TPE seemed newer but A 330's between TPE-DEL seemed older. IFE was fine and toilets were kept clean and cabin crew was polite and spoke fairly good English. We had a delay at YVR which was not really airlines' fault because the bridge could not be retracted. Apart from that all other three take offs were also slightly late. My only real complaint would be the beverages and food. They seem to be very limited in what they offer. Still I would certainly recommend it.

### China Airlines customer review
TPE-SIN in Y and DPS-TPE in C for a family vacation. CI allows instant cash upgrades at the airport and seems like a group of boisterous passengers took up the offer but the C cabin could not accommodate all of them. Instead they took turns in the C cabin which resulted in lots of chaos and unrest. Later the crew gave up maintaining order altogether. Also noticed an old lady with an infant was seated one row behind the bassinet seat while the bulkhead was occupied by one of the half business ladies. CI need to be more considerate handling passengers with infants for the old lady was holding her grandson all 5 hours of the flight. IFE was drop down screens from yesteryear. Not much contents to talk about. Otherwise the cabin was well maintained food adequate for a regional hop. I upgraded to C with my miles on the second sector. CI shares its premium lounge with a dozen other airlines in DPS. By mid afternoon the lounge had ran out of hot food barren of drinks and was over flowing with passengers even the common waiting area looked more appealing. Service onboard was warm and nothing was too much trouble. CI allows C passengers to pre-order meals 48 hours before the flight. Seafood with tomato concasse" didn't sound anywhere appetising but it turned out to be amazing. AVOD was well stocked but no amenities kit for our 6 hour flight. Late arrival into TPE due to heavy traffic but bags were delivered in record speed. Despite average products and staff CI continues to profit from expensive cross straits flights shared among a handful of Chinese airlines and hence had gotten unused to competition. I'm giving my Dynasty Miles a long rest after this.

CI53 from BNE to AKL continuation of flight from TPE. The aircraft upgraded to a B747-400 from usual A330-300 in Dec. Check in swift. Gate agents a bit rude. Managed to grab a seat on upper deck. Usually J class but sold as Y on BNE-AKL leg. Flight was on time. Arrived a few minutes early in to AKL. Food was reasonably good. Good AVOD entertainment. Fantastic flight attendants who were very polite and kind. Did two tea coffee runs. Excellent option to NZOFVA or JQ on route. Managed to get a good fare and would consider in future too.

London Heathrow to Hong Kong via Beijing one month round trip. Flights left pretty much on time nice planes with good food and great entertainment on the long haul LHR to PEK flight - individual entertainment systems. Aircraft were modern. Wide range of refreshments including Chinese beer and wine on both connecting flights. Small issue with return ticket (as PEK - LGW service had been stopped after I purchased) was easily rectified at Hong Kong check in - desk staff spoke good enough English. Point to note: confirm any schedule changes that are sent to you by phone for ease of mind.

### China Airlines customer review
LAX to Beijing to Hong Kong and back to LAX. The staff is mean to you if you are a westerner. The food is terrible - it reminds me of the food you would get on airlines in the 1990s. With every meal they would give you a tea cup but not offer you any tea so the cup just gets in the way while you are eating. The inflight entertainment is very poor some of them don't work at all and sometimes you don't even get any. The staff English skills are lacking terribly to the point that they might as well just speak to you in Chinese. I cannot stress enough how mean they are they are to westerners.

### China Airlines customer review
Flew from London Heathrow to Beijing on a weekend late afternoon flight. Wasn't particularly looking forward to it given some of the other reviews but the plane was fairly new and clean the in-flight entertainment system was fine (on demand personal seat selection with plenty of choice in English). The food was reasonable enough and the customer service at check-in and prior to that when I rang up to request seats together for three of us was good. Bit of an attempted scrum on to the slightly delayed plane but all-in-all this was much better than I had expected and up to the standard of other Star Alliance members. I'd still prefer to travel with British Airways and would pay more to do so but to be honest Air China weren't far away in terms of what they offer (though a bit more wine wouldn't go amiss).

### China Airlines customer review
My major complaint about this airline is that they allow only 15 pounds in tourist for carry on luggage that is 5-10 pounds less than most international airlines so for that reason I will not fly this airline again and I regret booking the flight. You will notice that I rated the airline very high on their seats food and overall service but I have found that with a limit of 20-25 pounds I can easily go on tour with a hand carry - but the 25 pound limit would make it impossible to do any shopping while on tour. Yes their prices are attractive and I believe their policy is short-sighted.

### China Airlines customer review
SFO to PEK in late August 2013. Plane was a 747 Combi. The plane had no entertainment system for a 15 hour flight with no entertainment system. There is a single screen at the front of economy and the entertainment (in Chinese) consisted of what appeared to be 30 second commercials. Late leaving mechanical malfunction before take off. Dinner was bland and disgusting the best thing were the dinner rolls which were fresh and warm. When you order drinks you are given a small 10oz plastic cup of the beverage no cans and good luck getting a refill. After dinner is server the cabin crew vanishes never to be seen again. I was told to call 2 weeks before I left for seat assignment. I followed the instructions and was told they could not issue seats I could not get seats in the US and now I can't get them in China. I was traveling with a child and therefore needed to ensure I had seats together. When I arrived at the airport they were able to get me two seats together for the trip from Shanghai to PEK and then PEK to SFO or so I thought. First leg of the trip the same poor service to which I had become accustomed no change there. When they scanned my ticket before boarding they said oh your seat assignment has been changed and wrote a new seat number on my ticket my nephew was located in another part of the plane. It seems that they do not feel the need to notify you of seat changes until you board. I told them this was unacceptable to which they put me off to the side and proceeded to board a full flight. Eventually they managed to get two seats together. I will never fly this airline again.

TPE-ICN. flown with them as a codeshare flight with Korean air. The plane (747) was very old (or at least seemed like that). Surprisingly the seat was very comfortable more than in most of the new planes I've flown with. The entertainment system isn't too varied but well enough for a short flight. The crew were professional. Overall liked the product.

SFO-Beijing-BKK flight in June 2013 and the service was mediocre. An old aircraft with 60-70 people sharing one big TV monitor. When we first got onboard it was very hot in the cabin the stewardess said its normal and once we were flying the temperature would cool down. The flight was late so I missed my connecting flight. I was placed into an airport hotel. On the last flight coming home there was water dropping from the overhead bin so the stewardess put tissues and napkins in between the gaps.

My husband and I along with mother and a group of friends flew to Paris via Shanghai and returned today from Madrid via Beijing. We have traveled using many of the Asian airlines and I would have to say that I have never experienced a worse airline at every level. On the first leg to Shanghai we were unable to book our luggage through and were all forced to go through immigration customs pick up our baggage and then repeat the process in reverse late at night even though we never left the airport. Told our flight was delayed 3 hours and were left to sit and wait in a deserted terminal staff were rude and unhelpful. Experienced a 2 hour delay at Beijing on the return flight. No explanation was given for either delay. On all aircraft's the seating was the most cramped of any airline I have used the staff were rude and the inflight entertainment mostly Asian. The European food option was limited and always seemed to run out at about aisle 50. Will never Air China again.

Houston TX (IAH) to Hong Kong (HKG) 9/23/13. Arrived in Beijing (PEK) to transfer to Hong Kong on 9/23/13 around 04.30am. Found out our flight to Hong Kong was cancelled due to the Super Typhoon. Tried to reschedule but was met with the worst customer service! Ticket counter employee was not only rude but unhelpful. Stated the only way to get to Hong Kong was to get on a flight on 09/28/13 or get on a flight to Shenzhen the follow day 09/24/13. Told the employee that our temporary visa was only good until 9/24/13. The employee then proceeded to rudely state that once we get to Shenzhen we were on our own to pay for the train into Hong Kong that the airline will not pay for. Told that we had to get out of the terminal and go to the booking counter to get our flight changed. We proceeded to head out but was stopped by another Air China employee that rudely said we cannot leave because we don't have a ticket to fly out. Finally was able to get my new ticket. Got on my flight to Shenzhen at 11.30am 9/24/13. Arrived in Shenzhen and caught a bus to Hong Kong. Stopped by the boarder security that said we were not allowed to leave Shenzhen and that our temporary visa was only good for Beijing! 0 customer service. Will never fly with this airline again.

I flew on 2 international and 3 domestic flights with Air China. Overall the experience was stressful and frustrating. My booking allowed for changes to my flights but the staff I communicated with about this were unhelpful and slow. All except one of the flights departed late (between 15 minutes and 5 hours) without clear communication as to the reason for the delays and how long the flights would be delayed. It took an hour to check in for one flight due to the staff being disorganised and once I boarded that flight I found that my seat had been changed without checking with me first. The food was average. Usually I really enjoy flying and am happy with what I pay for. Air China didn't deliver and was terrible value for money.

### China Airlines customer review
Flight 982 departed JFK late causing missed connection in Beijing to Air China Flight 979. Air China staff in Beijing were very rude. No apology for the missed connection and they sent passengers to a dreadful airport hotel and would only pay for shared rooms. If I wanted a single room I would have to pay for it myself which I did. Air China is a member of Star Alliance and I expected them to re-book on the first available flight which would have left at 6am the next morning but they would only rebook on the next Air China flight which did not depart until the next afternoon. I arrived at my destination almost 24 hours late and paid for lodging and food in Beijing out of my pocket.

Tokyo-Shanghai-Paris and Paris-Beijing-Tokyo. Trusted this airline because it is a Star Alliance member. International transfer at Shanghai was terrible. You have to immigrate and emigrate wasting a lot of time. Cabin crews were cheerful and trying to help passengers. Shanghai-to-Paris old A330 overall shabby but seat was not bad with full-flat and wide leg space. Paris-to-Beijing new 777-300ER clean and new aircraft full-flat bed but leg space was very narrow (not shot). Food was OK. Finally they lost my bag even though intra-airline connection.

Given the at-best mixed reviews on Air China's economy class product on this site I was pleasantly surprised at the JFK-PEK-SIN-PEK-JFK trip that I just completed this morning. When I searched for the flights Air China was among the most competitive in terms of the price (only United and Delta were cheaper). The JFK-PEK legs were on B777-300ER while the PEK-SIN legs were on A330-300. Seat comfort was expected given the class nothing stellar but nothing too bad either. On all legs AVOD was available. Food was decent but as far as I could tell only Asian options for the main dishes were available (featuring rice or noodle and some protein). Portion size might be small if you usually eat big (might be a problem for Americans). Flight attendants did a few rounds bringing water but you could also venture to the galley yourself to help yourself with some water and snack. If you are Asian the flight attendants would most likely talk to you in Mandarin first. I had no problems with transfers in PEK.

### China Airlines customer review
JFK-PEK and SHA-PEK-JFK on return leg. JFK-PEK-JFK flights were on a new B777-300ER. Full flat seats in an angled 2-2-2 configuration. Very comfortable seats for sitting and sleeping. Good food and drinks with a full bar and helpful FA's who sometimes struggled with English but could get by. Large IFE screen with AVOD although I wish they had a wider selection of English titles. Both flights were delayed by about half an hour. SHA-PEK was bang on time and was on a 777-200 which surprisingly had identical seats to the B777-300ER ie full flat - very nice for a 2-hour domestic flight. Very comfortable and they served a lavish hot breakfast on take-off. Baggage delivery was flawless. Overall very good experience and would recommend but the lounges at both PEK and SHA need to be upgraded.

Booked from SYD-PEK-LHR. On arriving at Sydney discovered a delay of 2.5 hours. Once in the air it transpired we were flying to Shanghai (with no notice of this). Arrived in Shanghai and were told we didn't need immigration cards as we were just transferring to PEK. However they made us exit the plane and walked us through Chinese immigration which took 1.5 hours. After a hellish crowd pushing through to the desk we were told to then walk back the same way we'd come and wait outside the same plane we'd just left. Rushed onto the plane and told to hurry sat in the same seat as previously. Waited nearly 2 hours sitting on the tarmac before we took off. On reaching PEK we were told we'd missed the flight to London and were shouted "go to hotel". Provided nothing in terms of information / customer service or food or drink. We had to sit and wait until 6am for any staff and had no help or English speaking customer service staff. After finally waiting until 6am told the flight would be 2.30pm. After waiting 13 hours in Beijing airport we finally got onto the flight to London Heathrow. The plane was hot / food was poor and the movies were also sub par.

SYD-PEK-SYD economy on an A330-200. Plane was clean comfortable good seat pitch good pillow and blanket. Flights left and arrived on time. Service was efficient with limited communication in English but friendly and pleasant. IFE was back of seat films a little dated but nothing offensive or vulgar so great for a family and easy to watch. Dinner was plentiful but average tasting and breakfast if European go English. Same on the return average but plentiful. Drinks are warm but that's everywhere in China not just in the air. Bathrooms clean but can get dirty quickly and queuing is not always respected. Flight was full so strict on luggage weight and allowance but the allowance is more than most airlines anyway over head lockers where plentiful and hardly used. I rang Air China and selected my seat in advance free over the phone and entered my FF details very helpful and good English. For a cheap carrier better than most direct flight on certain days SYD-PEK-SYD.

Milan-Beijing delayed about 3 hours so I lost the transfer to Sydney. I asked for assistance but the service was totally inadequate. They give me for the night an awful hotel (Golden Phoenix) in Beijing they had no accessible bus-shuttle and didn't seem to care about it everybody was unkind. Inflight the crew did not speak good english and unprofessional the entertainment did not work for a long time.

### China Airlines customer review
Houston-Beijing-Bangkok. Food quality inconsistent and for the most part poor. Service poor and some flight attendants rude can't have your phone on even in plane mode and staff is not bilingual. If you have a medical problem they try to ignore you. I had an asthma attack and had to beg for oxygen which they were initially reluctant to give me.

Shanghai Pudong-Taipei Taoyuan return on B747-400 excellent experience with CI arrival/departure on time only 1.5 hrs flight but got full meal and beverage service. AVOD with touch screen and lots movies cabin crew very friendly. Definitely will fly with CI again.

Hong Kong-Taichung on 737-800 and Taipei-Hong Kong on 747-400. Outbound flight to Taichung in central Taiwen which is very convenient for those who need to go to this area instead of flying to Taipei or Kaoshiung. Evening flight of 1.15hr duration warm meal was served beverages only tea and coffee though. Crew did not smile just did their job. Aircraft spotlessly clean. Return flight on 747-400 same flight duration also warm meal served this time with wine/beer/soft drinks. Very attentive FAs who interacted well with the passengers and smiled a lot. Lots of information from the flight deck too. Overall a very nice experience where else do you get a warm meal on such a short flight in Economy. Definitely recommendable and looking forward to using them again.

Took CI752 SIN-TPE-SIN and CI751. Punctuality was superb. As for on-board experience the A332 was rather comfortable with sufficient leg room for a 170cm person. The flight attendants some were not as friendly but there were those who made sure to smile as much as possible. The Personal IFE was average nothing special. My only problem with it was lack of movies. The food was okay. However we were not well-hydrated. FAs performed only 2-3 water rounds I had to keep asking for water. I liked how they gave some Taiwanese snack. The landing was quite smooth. Return journey delayed by 30 mins due to TPE jammed runway. More or less the same.

### China Airlines customer review
Spring break vacation. CI 31 YVR-TPE. The service in Economy was horrible some flight attendants didn't know what I was saying and the seat was extremely uncomfortable for a 13 hour flight. Legroom was only 31 inches I would expect 34 inches of legroom and a foot rest at least on a long flight like this. Inflight Entertainment on my seat was very bad it did not work seconds after takeoff. The seat was hard. The food was okay but I believe giving us paper cups for non alcoholic drinks and plastic cups for alcoholic drinks is wrong. Putting the A340-300 on the YVR route is not a great idea!

### China Airlines customer review
Taipei to Brisbane in business class on CI 53 11 May. A330-300 very comfortable lie flat seats and a nice Doona made for a restful night. Staff very attentive and meals and refreshments were offered at appropriate times. Would recommend for the good price and comfortable cabin. The entertainment was interesting and up to date and restrooms kept clean and well stocked.

### China Airlines customer review
TPE-MNL. Flight delayed by 25 minutes arrival time also delayed. No drinks except for water coffee or tea. When I went to the restroom I saw that there were other refreshments in the galley. The flight wasn't full and I took a chance if I would be served an extra meal. The crew said that she would check and came back with 3 packs of peanuts. It seems that seeing the crew with a smile is a "luxury". Not surprising why Eva Air has better reviews.

### China Airlines customer review
AMS to BKK about 6 to 7 times per year Lounges both ways quite good. Recently refurbished (last 12 months) the 747's which were good but now have reverted to the A340 and seats definitely far poorer. Please change back! Also the flight time has increased dramatically due to fuel saving flying at much lower speeds.

### China Airlines customer review
AMS-BKK. Seating 3x4x2 flight 90% Full. The one big problem was that the meals were only just warm not hot as they should have been. Crew carried out their duties well. Would fly them again.

### China Airlines customer review
Flew business class XMN-TPE-SFO and return LAX-TPE-XMN. Impressed by the refurbished cabin. The new seats are comfortable but are not lie-flat. Inflight meals are good but you can feel the catering quality outbound is better than inbound. The new LCD screen is higher definition one which makes inflight entertainment better.

### China Airlines customer review
NRT-TPE return. Check-in was smooth (SkyPriority). Lounges were comfortable. But foods at NRT were poor. Cabin (744 and 333) were clean and comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and spoke Japanese. Foods were good. AVOD was good. But no Japanese movie. Good value for money.

### China Airlines customer review
AMS-BKK-AMS in Economy. I registered with CAL's Frequent Flyer program and ordered a vegetarian meal which was served piping hot before general meals were served to other passengers which was an added bonus. CAL has switched to using their A340-300s on this route. Aircraft's are around 11 years old on average and every window seat in Economy class has a large IFE box underneath with severely restricts legroom. I was lucky on the outbound flight since the seat next to me was unoccupied and I could stretch my legs a bit. On the return leg however that wasn't the case and the 12-13 hour flight was particularly uncomfortable due to the cramped conditions. Seat pitch is 31 inches on these aircraft and the base moves forward when reclined which restricts legroom even further. Entertainment was generally good with the latest blockbusters on offer coupled with a wide selection of older films. BBC and CNN news channels were also available as were a good selection of audio CDs. The crew were very affable and free beverages and snacks were available throughout the flight and promptly served when requested. CAL offers good value for money and the flights run on time so I will definitely fly with them again. They just need to refurbish the seats on these older aircraft as they've done with their 747 fleet.

Flight from Hong Kong - Jakarta - Hong Kong with China Airlines CI679/CI680 in Economy class. Check in staff friendly and fast. I'm a Skyteam Elite Plus Member and used the lounges. Nice clean and helpful staff. Food and beverages good. No Priority Boarding at HKG Airport. Seat uncomfortable in A330. Food ok. Inflight Entertainment good. All Flights on time. Priority luggage in Hong Kong handled separately but ended up waiting longer. Would fly again.

Have flown China Airlines about 3 times now from Auckland to Brisbane and Sydney. Paid no more than $120 for my tickets (one way special). Ticket allowed free date changes which was a bonus! Normally pay $100 with other Trans Tasman Airlines. Friendly Cabin Crew. Great meals (not to mention complimentary beverages). Half the flight was empty of 2 services I flew which gave me rows to myself made it extremely comfortable to fly. Great entertainment system. Highly recommend out of NZ or Australia.

### China Airlines customer review
Round trip MNL-YVR via stopover at TPE. They seem to have done a major overhaul of their operating procedures and got their act together consistently for several years now. Their aircraft appeared to be in good to excellent condition and to the credit of the pilots involved those four landings were among the smoothest I've experienced in years. This airline may not be the best but I consider them to be very good. Fares are reasonable and given the level of service I received was good value for money.

### China Airlines customer review
Flew from Brisbane-Taipei-Wuhan and then Xi'an Xianyang-Taipei-Brisbane. Overall impression was highly favourable and an improvement on my previous experiences with CI. All flights were on A330-300 which is starting to look a little aged in economy class. Flights were on time or only slightly delayed and boarding was efficient. Meals were of a very high standard in economy and the mainly female cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I noticed that the fluency of English (though I understand Mandarin) has improved significantly. Inflight entertainment was personal AVOD but selection was not quite as large compared to Cathay or Qantas. Flight from TPE to BNE was on an A330 with upgraded economy cabin. The screens were larger and seat more comfortable so this was a nice improvement. Based on these flights I will fly with CI again and have no hesitation recommending.

### China Airlines customer review
Flew LAX-TPE-BKK and returned HAN-TPE-LAX. All flights left and arrived roughly on time. Staff were somewhat inattentive but got the job done. Had to signal an attendant to get a second glass of wine. Seat comfort OK for economy class. In-flight entertainment was very good.

AMS to BKK business class CI0066: 2 adults and one 3 year old brilliant service apart from a couple of hours delay from AMS which was down to snow not the airline - had a faultless service. Cabin staff were excellent with my daughter and this trip was stress free. I will be using this airline again shortly.

### China Airlines customer review
Taipei-Hong Kong Economy. Very uncomfortable seat with virtually no leg room. Luckily seat next to me was free and was able to stretch my legs in to that space. Breakfast was a greyish-looking chicken noodle dish that was unappetising. Cabin staff raced through the service and then disappeared. They were mechanical and their smiles were plastic. Thankfully the flight was short (90 min).

### China Airlines customer review
Amsterdam to Bangkok. The business class has been refurbished on this route but is not a flat bed seat - good seat pitch. The food and drinks were very good though the staff only ok. Moderate selection of films. Amsterdam bKLM lounge is huge with ok selection of snacks. Bangkok business lounge is surprisingly good with really good food though it doesn't have a toilet - you have to go down the corridor.

### China Airlines customer review
Osaka to JFK. The flight was 14 hours B747-400 I sat in a window seat just behind the wing. AVOD had new movies and a big variety of other entertainment. A big plus was that the AVOD selection was different coming home. The food was enjoyable and service was plentiful and well organized. The cabin crew were very pleasant and attentive. I am average size; 5'10" and 180 lbs and I had no need for more space. The recline and leg room were generous for economy. I usually fly Korean Air Asiana or Singapore for this route but since China Airlines was so much cheaper I thought I would give them a try once. If they are this cheap in the future I will fly with them again.

### China Airlines customer review
TPE to LAX. The seats are so close that when the person in front of me reclined I could not exit my seat or watch the seatback TV. It seems that over the past 2 years the service food and overall quality of flights has diminished. Our company no longer allows us to book our Asian rides on China Airlines and frankly I am glad. We pay 75 dollars more for flights on Singapore air and the difference is 10 fold.

### China Airlines customer review
LAX-TPE-HKG return with stopover in Taipei. The ground and flight staff were professional friendly and helpful. The airplanes looked new and well kept. The seats in the economy sections were new but the cushion was thin and soft causing severe discomfort on long flights. Complete meals served even on short flights the food was mainly edible but poor compared to other Asian airlines. I would have rated this an excellent airline if the seat cushion and food quality were better.

To and from Singapore and Surabaya economy class both on A330-300. Flights were all on time and return flight arrived ahead of schedule. Flight attendants were very friendly and attentive.

Food was just so-so but the taste was overall acceptable.

Awful experience from Taipei to LA. My husband is 6ft 4 and when we checked in early in the morning for our flights from Bangkok to Taipei and Taipei to LA we asked the ticket agent to sit us in seats that would accommodate his height. Told we'll have plenty of room. When we got onboard we were instead seated in the tightest seats next to the lavatory. When my husband couldn't sit down there was much flurry of activity to find him somewhere he could fit. He was embarrassed and naturally we were separated from him for the entire trip - no apology from anyone of course. Ironically people who checked in after us were seated in a front row with leg room. As usual much pushing and shoving onboard with no order imposed by the cabin crew. If flight attendants spent more time taking care of their customers they may have a few more happy customers.

I had some reservations been this leg part of a Delta itinerary I was not sure how CI would compare to DL economy comfort seat. Taipei-SFO economy smooth check-in well organize boarding seat 34A quite comfortable 32 pitch and personal AVOD. Departed on time at 23.50 informed crew not to serve dinner and I was left undisturbed and slept well till breakfast food was good for economy. Overall good flight and the crew were polite and interacted well I will fly again with CI now that are an integral part of the Skyteam.

SFO-Taipei-Bangkok (economy). SFO flight leaves at 1.30am but if you're planning to sleep tough luck - the hot meal is served at 3am and everyone (even if sleeping) is ordered to sit bolt upright so the person behind can eat. This was repeated at midnight on the return Taipei-SFO. Hot meal SFO -Taipei was disgusting. I would highly recommend you bring your own food. Kids meals were average both ways. Service was otherwise ok. Entertainment generally good - 747 screens have higher definition brightness and contrast than A330s where video quality is poor. Movie selection fairly good but can be limiting if you fly transpacific both ways the same month. Seat pitch a little tight at 32" for the tall. Boarding was highly organized at SFO but more chaotic at Taipei.

### China Airlines customer review
HKG-KHH return. Both trips A330-300. Outbound trip delayed 2 hours due to fuel problems and it resulted in refuelling. Staff were quick to serve the complaining passengers. The inflight entertainment system is quite good. The price was very reasonable as it was near the Easter holiday peak.

AMS-BKK-TPE-HKG. Renewed business class is not that comfortable it is an improvement to the old business class. Food quality remained basic but acceptable service is good when flight is empty once flight is crowded cabin crew seem to loose control. Price of flight is still cheaper then other airlines lounge in BKK HKG and Taipei airport are fine with nice snacks. AMS lounge is the Skyteam KLM lounge - food is bad but what can you expect when in the Netherlands.

SYD-TPE-YVR return. I was unsure and a bit sceptical. Overall my friend and I were really happy the food was excellent the staff lovely and the entertainment great. The cabin crew spoke good English and were always around to offer assistance. The only issue we had was two excruciatingly long stop-overs. (18hrs outbound and 17 on return). The seats weren't the best ever but could've been worse.

### China Airlines customer review
AMS-BKK-TPE and back. Outbound a 747 with no AVOD just centralized screens. Decent meals topped with friendly and professional cabin crew. On the return - modern IFE with touch screens but flight attendants not quite as effective. Troubles with processing my wheelchair at TPE but that may be inefficacy of the airport. In general good service/price ratio.

### China Airlines customer review
NRT-TPE-BKK return. Impressed with service and the level of English for most flight attendants. AVOD was good. Seats on A330-300s are fine but recline to a very uncomfortable slide rather than flat. Provided plenty of English magazines though newspapers were scarce. Lounge in BKK excellent with hot and cold dishes. Flight was 1 hr late leaving BKK but were given a meal voucher in the airport despite the fact food in the lounge was ample. Connecting in Taipei was easy as it's not a very large airport. If the prices in business class remain a bargain I will be flying China Airlines more in the future.

### China Airlines customer review
BNE-AKL Business Class Jan 2012. Boarding was well organized and the fight punctual. Food for lunch was good quality although there was no proper dessert. Problem was that the service felt very rushed even though it was a 3 hour flight. A particular problem I have encountered on all CI flights is that the crew seem unable to co-ordinate the service of wine with food and then to keep glasses topped up even in a small business class cabin. Twice I had to use the call button in order to get some wine. Although it was answered instantly this is no substitute for a proper drinks trolley service. Notwithstanding this the cabin crew were unfailingly friendly and helpful in their attitude. Unfortunately my bag came last off the carousel last rather than enjoying the advertised priority.

### China Airlines customer review
LAX-TPE-MNL twice in the past year. Seats in economy seem small to me (I am over 6 ft. FA's are attentive but not very friendly - seems to be due to somewhat limited English. When I asked for drinks in Chinese they were much more social. The food was good if you ordered Chinese option. TPE is not my favorite airport but it is orderly and clean.

### China Airlines customer review
Short hop from BNE to AKL. Check-in staff member was helpful and friendly and the wait was minimal. The flight departed thirty minutes late but were kept well informed. The meal service was cheerful with a selection of mains. The in-seat entertainment was clunky and poorly designed and the language selection confusing to say the least. Seat width and comfort were as expected for economy and the staff pleasant and fluent in English. Overall an enjoyable and professional service.

### China Airlines customer review
Auckland to Brisbane (my wife had wheel chair assistance) and we were very impressed by the level of comfort and service. It was the cheapest price and the fare included a meal and movie. The legroom was a little tight the level of English was difficult to understand at times - announcements given first in Chinese then in English. Cabin temperature way too warm and the aircraft appeared to have no personal air vents above. The staff were friendly and polite.

Shanghai to Sydney. We booked this flight at very short notice and were slightly apprehensive. However we need not have worried. Despite the very short notice my wife and I were seated together. The aircraft was a very new looking A330 and we found our Economy class seats very comfortable. The standard of cabin service was not bad with the crew even managing to accommodate our special meal requests. Although the flight departed slightly late from Shanghai due to problems when inbound from Beijing we actually arrived on schedule at Sydney. Ultimately we were very pleased with the flight and service received and will certainly consider flying China Airlines again.

### China Airlines customer review
PRG-FRA-TPE return. Codeshare with CSA (PRG-FRA segment). FRA-TPE flight was operated with B747 instead of usual A340. Cabin crew attentive and helpful meals were tasty and refreshments between meals provided on demand. Outdated centralized AV system but worked ok. The big downside of the flight was AC - it was really cold. Return flight (TPE-FRA) with standard A340 (2-4-2 in economy) was fine. AC settings were correct personalised AVOD system worked without problems with a great selection of movies and music. Meals and drinks were fine and cabin crew helpful.

FAs handed out slippers headset IFE and Duty free catalogue. AVOD started and staff served drinks. AVOD with just 12 current movies 40 oldies in several languages games music etc. FAs mainly young and well presented. After 1 hour another 3 hour delay announced and FAs served hot lunch. On departure drinks offered and duty free. During the flight FAs offered sandwiches and soft drinks. Breakfast (2 choices) served before arrival and purser provided information about connecting flights. CAL offered day rooms and meals at Taipei for passengers who had late evening connecting flights. TPE-BKK on old B747-400 with no PTV just a main screen - lunch served with better quality and quantity than TPE-FRA. Return flights on A340-300 and similar experience.

LHR-TPE-DPS return in Y. Ground staff polite and helpful cabin crew attentive some better then the others. LHR- TPE-LHR very good cabin presence offering water and juice. AVOD good with some current movies to choose from. Two good quality meals served LHR-TPE-LHR and one TPE-DPS-TPE. Baggage arrived quickly. Seats reasonable comfortable on A340 and very comfortable on B738 (try getting row 16/17 as much more legroom). Would fly with them again especially as it was £600 for the ticket.

Taipei to Tokyo round trip twice this summer. Services provided on flights from TSA to HND are more improved than other routes. Free slippers earphones blankets and pillows are placed in the seat pocket when boarding. Attendants with mediocre language skills still served well meals were fine with two main selections captain's inflight broadcast was clear and fluent in Mandarin English and Japanese which meets most of the passengers' need onboard. Although the price was a little high compared to TPE-NRT where TSA-HND is considered a business route the service and punctuality still made the journey worthwhile.

TPE-YVR-TPE. A340-300s. E-Checkin and Self Print Boarding Passes were quick and easy to use at Taipei. Boarding commenced with proper order according to zones. After takeoff the Fantasy Sky AVOD was immediately turned on slippers and headsets handed out. AVOD had a selection of 101 movies meals were tasty and served hot numerous drink rounds were made. Toothbrushes put out during the night and restrooms were kept clean by FA's. Delayed on the return due to technical issues however the purser and FA's handled the situation well. Announcements from the captain were made quickly and FA's quickly began drink rounds. AVOD was started as soon as the drink rounds finished.

Been travelling with China Airlines 4 times now. And I have to say it is quite a service you get plus comfortable seats with LCD screen lots of movies (even new movies which just released) games. I have nothing to complain about. The food is acceptable and they are mostly right on the time with the flights. Only one time it has been late at arriving. However it was only 30 mins which is acceptable for me.

SYD-JFK via TPE/KIX. All flights arrived on time. Sydney-Taipei flights (A330) have the long haul 166 degree angled flat beds. Taipei-New York was in the first newly refurbished 747 which is the same business product as Thai Airlines/Gulf Air/Turkish. Excellent product and nice new pillows and soft duvets. Food high quality and AVOD lots of choice. Quick transfer at TPE but total journey was 29hrs. The price justified the route and choice of airline. Would fly again.

### China Airlines customer review
TPE-SFO. Flight was 2 hours late due to late arrival of aircraft and later a mechanical failure. Boarding chaotic and disorganized. Very tired cabin flickering lights dirty overhead projectors no PTVs not even air nozzles. Blackout twice during taxi and crew had to manually perform safety demo which took up 10 mins both in Chinese and English. They try very hard to sound pleasant and friendly with their English but it doesn't work without 'pleases' and 'thank yous'. Food ok. Overall I regretted paying more for such an outdated product. They're currently upgrading their cabins but that's no excuse for the poorly co-ordinated delay and rudeness.

I purchased our tickets refundable Business class for the family to Europe. A medical surgery came up and we had to cancel - since we have fully refundable I didn't think it would be a problem. I read through the terms prior to purchasing. After getting the runaround from the Bangkok sales office I was finally told to do it online. In order to get a refund you have to agree to wait 45 days for the charge back to a credit card. Of course this wasn't mentioned during the purchasing process. I called the ticket office and they told me it would be much longer than 45 days. We will get a refund but weren't prepared for the lengthy time.

### China Airlines customer review
Flights on China Airlines are fine. My complaint is about their frequent flyer program. Don't bother. They give you an award ticket for 30000 miles but it is only good for Hawaii which has no Availability through the year end (a full 12 months at the time of our attempt) at which point the ticket is no longer valid. So we had to make a special request to "downgrade" our award to 25000 miles so we could chose any flight in the continental US. Still pretty much impossible to get a ticket. The stupid thing is the staff will sit with you on the phone for hours trying. First they have to plug in a specific flight both outbound and return and then wait for their partner airline to get back to them. It is always unavailable even though the super saver discounted tickets are still not sold out on the web site. So they not only waste my time but they pay their staff to sit on the phone and go through this useless exercise. Eventually the staff will tell you that they can't stay on the phone all day!

### China Airlines customer review
Auckland to Brisbane return. Modern A330-300 2-4-2 seating configuration cabin fresh and clean if a little cramped. The fare was less for a full service airline than a low cost airline with no meal or baggage allowance - hence the plane was pretty full. Check in was done by Air NZ at AKL and Qantas at BNE so efficient and without difficulty. The personal allowance of 20 kg per person was allowed to be pooled over our family group so we weren't charged for the 28kg case as we would have on other airlines. Cabin crew were mainly young and well presented. Their English was possibly only at a novice level. The seats were comfortable with adjustable winged head rests. In flight entertainment was a touch screen seat back TV approx 7 inch screen; a choice of about 15 current movies plus a catalogue of oldies and regional content as well as the usual games music etc. Outbound headphones blankets and pillows on seat on. Soft drinks served before a light dinner - reasonable quality. Wine served with the meal this was poor - maybe ask for a beer instead. Hot drinks were served afterwards. The inbound was a little different; as the aircraft had arrived from Taipei some seats had headphones others none. The cabin crew distributed these shortly after take off. All in all a decent flight crew were pleasant not exceptional but not poor either.

Brisbane to Auckland Easter Friday and flight was very busy. An ageing A330 seats were rather hard and uncomfortable. IFE was very good and offered a range of movies and music. The service was above average with a good meal and tea and coffee offered. The service was efficient but not polite and had an indifferent aspect to it. If the price does not remain competitive I would not use this airline again.

Flew economy LAX to TPE. Flight was late 30 minutes at least taking off. Then after take off the estimated arrival time kept being moved back. The flight ended up 1 hour 25 minutes late landing. Flight was completely full - to the point they were weighing bags and people. The check staff literally told people to get on the scales. The plane was an upgraded 747-400 that had personally video screens in economy seats were very narrow and the seat pitch was painful. Food portions tiny. No more hot towels provided upon boarding and before landing.

We booked our return trip LHR-BNE in August 2010 with China Airlines. We are due to depart from LHR on the 10/4/2011. Two days before our departure China airlines called and cancelled our flight due to the cancellation of the flight from Taipei to BNE. They didn't give us any reason and not even try to find us the alternative route. Although we have the full refund we have to find another airlines in the last minute. Luckily we are able to get on another airlines but it cost us £600 extra due to last minute fare. We are so disgusted with China Airlines and we would not recommend China Airlines to anyone. It is a joke that a 4-star airline provide such a terrible service.

Two weeks ago my wife and I travelled to Taipei and Hong Kong on China Airlines Economy Class. On both ways we find the services worthy of high commendation. Both the ground staff and the attendants prompt courteous and responsible to the customer needs and details. The food and beverage were sufficient and of excellent quality.

BKK-YVR. Planes new but had a 3 hour mechanical in BKK so missed connection in Taiwan. It felt like they had this problem many times before. As I was on a bereavement fare they placed me in the bulkhead with no other seats occupied in the row (seems nice) When I boarded there was a family of 15 with at least 8 kids from India. I was told there were no other seats available but after 8 hours of screams and people sleeping and crawling on me and other passengers getting upset they moved me to 1st class where there appeared to be several empty seats. After being lied to and putting up with sub-par food and no sleep the flight attendant moved me to avoid a scene. I would fly another airline next time even if it's a little more money.

CGK-LAX-CGK last time was not entirely satisfying. CGK-TPE was good with TV screen on the back seat though it was only 5 hours flight. I continued my 16 hours flight TPE-LAX with no TV screen on the back seat and it was boring. China Airlines lounge in Taipei is good. Staff are friendly good snacks and drinks. I count it as a compensation to my disappointment to long- hours flight with no TV screen.

### China Airlines customer review
Supposed to fly LHR-TPE-SYD flights changed at short notice to LHR-AMS-BKK-TPE-SYD adding 13 hrs to journey - no explanation. Given 45 hr trip with 11 hrs at Taipei : not good with 4 yr old and 9 yr old. Rice or noodles every meal - my kids didn't eat whole journey. On the plus side they did give us a complimentary hotel room in Taipei.

LAX-Taipei-Denpasar traveling in Economy with an active three year old. We were given bulkhead seats before we got to the airport. Got to LAX and was ushered to the almost non existent Business Class queue as I had a young child. My son was accompanied without this being requested by a friendly steward when we got on the plane as I had too much to carry (I took his FAA approved car seat with us). His kids meals arrived without prompting and were favorably received. On the Denpasar leg I asked for his kids meal before they were being served as my son was hungry - it arrived two minutes later with a smile. We were also offered the choice of moving into an empty four seat section on this leg so that we could rest more comfortably. Throughout the service was wonderful. Nothing seemed too much trouble. Plus the flights were on time the toilets were always clean and the adult food was perfectly acceptable too.

LAX - Hanoi via Taipei return Business Class. Overall very good service at a very reasonable price. Service attentive (almost too attentive). Seats not lie-flat but able to sleep on both trans-Pacific legs. Overall service is very similar to US domestic business class at about half the cost. Would fly with them again at this level of pricing.

### China Airlines customer review
TPE-PEK. Upgraded to Business Class at boarding as wanted some peace on this morning flight. Business class on B747-400 is sort of angled lie-flat but I would not be happy to spend 14h on a transpacific flight in one of those seats. Service polite and friendly and food is not bad. I could sleep a bit and I found the upper deck seats to be better and also the best seats are the ones in row 9. I was quite happy with this flight and think they are a good airline. Four star and no more though. Seat is really borderline for Business class.

### China Airlines customer review
Brisbane to Auckland. China Airlines have recently added this sector and are offering a full service flight at a very reasonable price and flight times are excellent. A340 was spotless on demand IFE was very good meal was pretty good. Crew were very attentive not a full trip probably only 60%.

### China Airlines customer review
LHR-TPE return in business - rescheduled return via Frankfurt due to unexplained and unhelpful cancellation of original flight. Outbound crew excellent but food not as good as usual. Seats not lie-flat but fine for resting. Return service noticably poorer and dinner rushed on the basis that it was a night flight. Personally I expect the choice of a full or express service and had the same problem last time I flew this route. Overall a fair and pleasant business product for the price.

### China Airlines customer review
LHR-TPE-SYD. Food drink and service were good. Lounge at Taipei not brilliant but good enough. Priority baggage seemed to come off last for all of us that had a connecting flight in Taipei. Return flight arrives in TPE before anything opens and seemingly before any staff arrived - a nightmare working out where to go. Airline staff were very friendly couldn't do enough for you.

Vancouver to Bali back and forth - no PTV on seats and old 747 aircraft. Even if it's 1500$ cheaper then flying other airlines I'll never fly with China airlines again.

Sydney - Taipei - Vienna in Business. Stopped overnight at Sunmoon Lake Taiwan to catch connected Vienna service. Flew CI last year and the service is still good. Qantas lounge in Sydney excellent CI lounge in Taipei ok limited drinks and food. On board service good but they really need to review serving breakfast three hours before arrival in Taipei when the flight arrives at 4.10 am. This could have been done 1.5 hours prior. Would fly again if they keep the fares low and continue to offer the better airbus business class seats on the route that I wish to fly.

### China Airlines customer review
Sydney-Taipei-Peking-Taipei-Sydney. I was impressed with service on the ground and onboard. The inflight service didn't have many 'trappings' (eg. no hot-towel before departure) as some airlines do but was sincere with good interaction from flight attendants. Food was very tasty and woolong tea was the great drink to wind up a meal. The downer was the limited leg room on the A330-300 between Sydney and Taipei considering it was a long-haul night flight. The flights between Taipei and Peking were much more pleasant.

### China Airlines customer review
LHR-TPE-SYD return in C. Very attractive pricing but 5 hour layover in TPE make for 29-hour trip which is on the long side . Outward trip more than acceptable for the cost. A340 C-class seats are quite comfortable; less so for the A330 TPE-SYD leg. Lounges at LHR and TPE both did the job. Meals drinks and IFE all okay without being stunning - to some degree I suppose you get what you pay for. Return leg was problematic. TPE-LHR flight cancelled (no reason given at SYD) ended up rerouted via Frankfurt with a BA short-haul FRA-LHR leg. Main problem with this was a 20 hour layover in TPE (first flight landed at 0400 and FRA flight departed midnight); with a 4 hour wait in FRA for the final leg this made for a 50 hour trip which is really not good. Layover arrangements in TPE were acceptable in the circumstances : comfortable Novotel for the day with meals transfers organised swiftly and efficiently. However the business class product on TPE-FRA (747-400) is really quite poor - it is at least a decade out of date and looks like it. Meal service roughly equivalent to other sectors flown but seat not really acceptable and IFE laughably poor. Overall would consider again and regard it as very good value for money had all four sectors flown as originally scheduled.

### China Airlines customer review
Heathrow-Taipei-Sydney return in Economy. Surprised how good the service was as expectations were low due to low price. Good travelling times. Good food although got a bit fed up with rice and noodles. Staff happy to get drinks. Taipei airport not the best. Didn't open till 6am so had to sit on floor with no food drinks or information for an hour or so. Plane not full on way back so had 2 seats each and lay down.

### China Airlines customer review
Heathrow-Taipei-Sydney return in Business class. Check in LHR T4 was excellent and Skyteam lounge is acceptable. Onboard seating (A340-300 and A330-300) just about adequate - it is not lie-flat. Service ok crews friendly and managed as well as they could given their poor command of English. Meals and drinks services rather haphazard with drinks being served only with meals - and in very small glasses wine selection the same on all flights and not very interesting. Food ok with 3 main course selections but the service processes need some refinement. TPE lounge is a rather depressing windowless facility although the showers are welcome - however it was not open when landing back at 0415 on the return leg nor were there staff available to direct transferring passengers to the correct terminal (flight/gate not noted on the information screens). It eventually opened at 0530 but this needs correcting. Note should be made that the LHR-TPE-LHR sectors are very long as CI cannot fly over Chinese airspace - eastbound was over India Thailand Hong Kong then north-east to TPE (about 13 hours) and westbound was over Japan Siberia etc (14.5 hours). One thing that CI must address - the priority baggage tag system does not work and both in SYD and LHR all bags that had transferred in TPE came off last. The main advantage in using CI for this type of journey is cost - keep expectations low and it is ok.

### China Airlines customer review
TPE-JFK. Business class price wise. Boeing 747-400 old cabin design inadequate seating (outdated sleeperettes) broken legrest. Food good but little and poorly presented. Nuts and rice crackers as snacks during more than 15 hour flight. inattentive crew. Waited four days for luggage after arrival.

### China Airlines customer review
London-Taipei-Sydney Business Class. Online seat selection is available one month before the first sector is flown and selection was honoured. Online check in can be done twenty four hours before the flight and was completed but boarding passes would not print out. Check in at the airport is at a dedicated desk and was fast end efficient. China Airlines uses the Skyteam lounge which is close to the departure gate - lounge is spacious and attractively designed and has all the facilities you can expect. On boarding coats are taken and welcome drink appears. China Airlines is not big on alcohol so that drink is Oolong tea. Aircraft LHR-TPE-SYD route have no first class and business cabin is right forward. There was no pre-dinner drinks service and the drink I ordered came on my meal tray. Meals properly served course by course and accompanied by wine wine on offer was adequate but not up to much and it was served in glasses more appropriate for serving a small sherry. The meal was tasty and interesting and there were choices for each course that was presented on good tableware with plastic cutlery. TPE-SYD sector the cutlery was stainless steel. Seats in business class are angled lie-flat ones but the footrest rise is a bit less than adequate and I noticed that several passengers used their pillow to give extra height to bring legs up to a more comfortable position. The seat controls are on the top of the armrest where they are nudged several times on a thirteen hour flight to cause sudden small random movements. I did not use the entertainment. We broke the flight at TPE for a two night stopover which was allowed within the basic fare. Arrival procedures at Terminal 1 very fast and away from the airport about thirty minutes after landing. TPE-SYD sector departs from Terminal 2. The China Airlines lounge is basic and looks like a railway carriage. Close by is another lounge that welcomes Priority Pass cardholders so those passengers may be better off trying that one instead. Arriving at Sydney was not the best. We were parked at the wrong gate where there was no one to meet the aircraft. After some delay and a debate whether the plane would be towed to the correct gate eventually the original gate was staffed and we left the aircraft 45 minutes later. We chose China Airlines because it offers competitive fares on the route and were satisfied with the service they provided.

AMS-BKK return in Dynasty. Dynasty class is excellent value in the increasingly costly world of premium cabin flying. KLM Air France British Airways and Thai Airways do this route with noticeably flatter seats wider menu choice and better AVOD but you pay accordingly. It's down to choice and the size of your wallet I guess. Well organised boarding attentive service good drink choice on time departures and arrivals. Plane is a little older than some but it's clean and well maintained. Overall a great choice for those who want a biz class service without breaking the bank.

LHR-TPE-DPS return. Paid £540 for a return flight to Bali. We were very impressed by the excellent service and friendliness from crew on each. Inflight entertainment good. Food fine and plenty of it they keep you fed regularly. We did find the flight home from Bali to Heathrow long ie. Bali to Taipei 5 hours - Taipei to LHR 14.5 hrs. We would probably use China Airlines again if the prices remain reasonable but would ideally take a shorter route if the prices were similar.

Brisbane to Hong Kong via TPE return Business Class. Check in brilliant in Brisbane Air NZ lounge in Brisbane fantastic with plenty of food and refreshments. The seats definitely need improving on A330-300 but managed to get about 4 hours sleep. The service in the air was the best in a long time. Attentive and willing to supply drinks and or food. Meal also very good. TPE to HK was on 737. Return the same. It's great value for money in business class.

### China Airlines customer review
LHR-TPE-DPS return. The price was £500 for weekend daytime flights. Flights between UK and Taipei were full but you can call the airline to pre-book seats. A340 has 2-4-2 configuration so if you're travelling as a couple it is easy to relax if you book the window seats. Flights between Taipei and Bali were half full and we were given exit seats in both directions. Food was ok but don't expect Western food to be great. Entertainment system between UK and Taiwan excellent. Huge selection of current films shows CD albums and games. Check in staff ground staff and cabin crew all very helpful. Taipei airport was ok - worth noting that a new terminal is nearing completion and it looks very modern. Overall a very enjoyable experience and I would use this airline again. Prices probably will start to creep up as they become more established in the UK market.

Mixed Y/C-class VIE-TPE-ROR return. Long haul Economy class quite satisfying. Good seat nice AVOD enough space enough rounds of drinks. Quick check-in in Vienna flexible with last- minute seat changes at the gate and friendly staff. On the way back food was nothing to write home about. Even the Asian food choice. C-class flights to Koror in Palau on a 737-800 and back were a very pleasant experience with a small cabin and comfortable old-style business class seats which are okay for a 4hr flight. The flight-attendent addresses you personally with your name (or try to do so) serve you plenty of rounds of drinks (good Champagne the Geman Riesling was to much "Spätlese" to go with your main the Californian Chardonnay was a good choice) and make your stay onboard very enjoyable. The transfer in Taipei was swift and the luggage made it back to Vienna with even 1 hour transfer time. Impressed. The only downside was checking-in in Koror which was only done by a single agent for transfer passengers it was done manually (!) and you did not receive the transfer boarding pass. At least the boarding passes have been already printed out in Taipei at the transfer desk.

SYD to LHR via Taipei Business Class. China Airlines use the Qantas Business Lounge at SYD - good food choice of drinks and nice showers. China Airlines Business Class seat is comfortable for sitting but for sleeping it is way off the standard as the seats are not flat or even angled flat. The meals have deteriorated over the last few years. The wine selection is poor amenity kit is a waste of space - why do they bother. IFE is good films are not that up to date but there is a reasonable selection. Taipei Business lounge not great the T2 lounge better than T1 lounge. They use the Sky Team lounge at LHR which is very busy in the early evening but an hour or so before the 1000pm departure it is quiet pleasant. Really nice shower at LHR. Overall when compared to other Business products on this route you get what you paid for.

### China Airlines customer review
LHR-TPE on A340-300 and TPE-DPS on B737-800 return. Chosen because of price and the A343 had AVOD making 13-14 hour flight more bearable. Good selection of films and shows with choice of languages. I had bulkhead seat due to my height bit narrow but legroom gain made up for it despite sitting next to families with babies! Food ok two full meal service and sandwiches available between. The drinks service was minimal as reported by others ( 1 small glass of wine with dinner) but staff happy to provide drinks when asked. Staff friendly and attentive. 90 minute delay on way back in Taipei gate desk had a complimentary drinks station set up within 30 minutes shows good customer service. Taipei airport is being renovated but as had only 1-2 hours transfer time no issue free Wifi and internet terminals available makes passing time easier.

Business class from Amsterdam to Bangkok. Seats are not up to the standard of most airlines but cost is significantly less and represents value for money. Staff onboard very friendly and service good. Return journey delayed by 24 hours with no explanation connection from Amsterdam back to UK changed for no apparent reason causing a 6 hour wait (this has happened on both occasions I used the airline). Staff at desk in terminal building at Amsterdam very rude and unhelpful. Staff at China airlines in London equally rude in never replying to several communications which were simply asking if such changes are standard procedure prior to making further bookings. Pity the ground staff do not match the standards of the ones I met on the flights. Doubt very much if I will consider this airline again despite the cost savings having flown this route countless times problem free with other airlines and having so many options to select from.

Sydney-Taipei-Heathrow. This airline was cheapest by a long shot and suggested by the travel agent. Seating was adequate. Inflight entertainment pretty good as was food. The staff at check in and on board were lovely and extremely polite and helpful. Would definitely fly with again the only downside is the route - 14.5 hours from Taipei to Heathrow and the amount of time spent waiting at Taipei airport for connecting flights as Taipei airport is probably not the best place to waste 6 hours. Take a good book and a packed lunch.

BKK-AMS. The night flight from BKK was again very poor. Food was served quickly and of a poor standard - given the smallest glass of wine with the meal and then during the flight no water runs. I had to go to the galley every time I wanted anything. Big screen was poor and not working correctly. I use China Airlines as they were a cheap way to get to Thailand. I wont be using them again if possible.

### China Airlines customer review
AMS-BKK. China Airlines are getting worse on this route. It's still the old B747 which really needs upgrading. Your are time-warped back to the 70's when you get onboard. Fuzzy big screens should be a thing of the past. The food is okay stewards are OK if a bit miserable with the beer wine and a smile!

### China Airlines customer review
LAX-TPE-HKG-TPE-LAX economy. Very cheap fares. Punctual. Attentive and friendly flight attendants. The food quality was fine and consistent throughout all flights. A tip - if you fly an Asia-based airline choose the Asian dish if given a choice between the Asian and Western dish. Obviously they'll be far more skilled at preparing the Asian dish. My only complaints are the dearth of movie selections (they remain unchanged two weeks later on my return trip) and the lack of individual air nozzles. On each of my flights the entertainment system was individual.

DPS-TPE-YVR 7th September- Business Class. Greeted onboard by name and addressed by name during the entire flight. Water and juice offered on boarding. After take-off drinks requests taken. Champagne (french) chilled and served in Champagne glass. The seat was an angled capsule type. It was a bit hard and would not want to do long haul on this type of seat but for a six hour day time flight is was acceptable. Menus were handed out and dinner requests were taken. Dinner was served individually on china and the fish I ordered was tasty but the food on the whole was not excellent and I would give it 3.5 out of 5. The flight attendants were pleasant and helpful. During our transfer were went to the dynasty Lounge. The food was fine but it did get crowded. I noticed some passengers taking towels to the bathroom so showers are available. The next flight to Vancouver was on the A340 and the seats on this flight while not lie flat as previously stated in reviews are very comfortable. I appreciated the noise canceling ear phones on both flights. Amenity kits were handed out on this flight and I found these rather sparse. The food on this flight was not great my husband ordered the lamb and it was so tough he did not eat it. I again ordered fish and it was a bit dry but eatable. The entertainment system on both flight was good and on the whole for the price paid I felt we got value for money. The flight attendants on the Vancouver route were not as pleasant but did there job well and fulfilled all requests made.

### China Airlines customer review
Taipei to Vancouver in Business Class. No alcoholic welcome drinks offered upon boarding only water and juice. They were quick to announce that since this was a late evening departure they would be serving only a light meal - but since it was only 11pm I felt this a bit of a cheap excuse since the flight is nearly 12 hours in duration. Even after take-off I had to ask for a drink as it became evident they weren't going to offer any before the light meal - of which there only two choices (one Asian and one sort-of Western) - wine was ok. As far as I could tell there was no service between meals - not even water trips - though they did hand out small bottles early on. Contrary to other suggestions here and elsewhere this route does not have angled beds in J/C Class - only the old z-style recliner seat. AVOD was pretty good - with a decent selection of both movies and music - didn't go back to Y section so not sure what was available there. Biz class seat was a bit cheaper than others flying the route - but to be honest I would have been much better of flying Cathay in Y class and saving the difference.

### China Airlines customer review
I flew from ANC to TPE with family including one 5 yr old. We had 3 adjacent confirmed seats. The flight originated from JFK. When we checked in at ANC we were put in 3 separated seats because the middle one of our seats had been given to someone boarding at JFK. One of us was given a seat 30 rows further back. I objected and was told that CI staff at JFK can ignore confirmed seats for passengers boarding after JFK and that the plane was full. In other words a confirmed seat didn't really mean that. The seats we were given would have necessitated our 5 yr old sitting separately. I was told that it could probably be sorted out on board. But on boarding the aircraft the aircrew wouldn't even take care of it - I was told that I had to ask the other passenger to switch. I got their attention by saying that we were going to go to our original confirmed seats and they could decide what to do about that at takeoff time. It happened that the JFK originating passenger was willing to switch when he saw the situation but I think it was really bad procedure for CI to have put us through that. Either confirmed seats should mean that or there shouldn't be a pretence that there are confirmed seats. And certainly a young child should never be re-seated to a separated seat.

### China Airlines customer review
AMS-BKK-TPE. The business class seats on the 747-400 were just seats no beds. No plug for laptop no entertainment system (except 4 tv channels). The food was so-so they even served foie gras! Rice dry and sticky. Prices are friendly but for business class travel I would recommend another airline on this route.

### China Airlines customer review
BNE-TPE-LHR return. China Airlines gives deep discounts for business travel and at these prices the product is marvellous value. Punctuality on flights was quite good. Staff were keen and attentive but found it difficult to coordinate service of bread and sometimes wine with the meals even though the cabin was small. Amount of food very substantial and quality good. AVOD good. My principle bugbear is that they close the window blinds on day flights. This is not something people would do at home and never happens on surface transport.

I booked business class seats for my daughter and elderly father to travel Sydney to Frankfurt via Taipei. They could not have been happier with the service provided including wheelchair assistance at Taipei and Frankfurt airports. Food very good but most impressive was the attention care and respect shown by staff towards my 88 year old father.

### China Airlines customer review
JFK New York -Taipei was one of the worst flights we've been on. Very old planes with uncomfortable seats and no personal TV's in seats. For such a long flight it was extremely unpleasant. They played some very old movies on the small ancient overhead TV's. All in all it was the cheapest flight we could get at the last minute so if there's any consolation that would be it. We got what we paid for.

### China Airlines customer review
HKG-LAX via TPE. TPE-LAX flight was good as they offered me 2 meals plus a snack. IFE was not bad and they have most of the current popular movies on there. Business Class section was somewhat cold most of the flight but they did give me 2 blankets. HKG-TPE was at best a 5/10. The cabin was cold and they offered only a snack and a drink (they claimed to give 2 drinks on short-haul Business Class cabin).
