### "issue was resolved"
Recently, I made another booking but realised I’d made a mistake with my ticket. I contacted RBA via their online form, and received a very prompt response. The emails that were helpful and my issue was resolved within two days.

### "Biggest letdown was the food"
Flew from Taipei to Dubai via Brunei. Chose this airline due to the good price. All flights more or less on time. Planes and bathrooms clean. Staff professional and kind. Biggest letdown was the food. There was only one meal for a flight of about 10 hours from Brunei to Dubai which felt a bit cheap. Quality of food about on the same par as a US airline. I brought a good book so did not bother with the entertainment. Managed to score business class by bidding on the Dubai to Brunei return segment and passed out for most of the flight due to the very comfortable bedding. An airline with potential.

### "A long but pleasant flight"
A long but pleasant flight. Cabin crew were kind and friendly; gave me snacks when I walked to back of the plane to stretch my legs. Food was good. The only hiccup was the website has glitches on some of the pages for online check-in when accessed from mobile phone. I had to use iPad to find a workaround in the end. 24 hour call centre / hotline based in Brunei was very useful and answered the call with no queue. You don’t get that efficiency from many carriers these days.

### "disappointing experience"
I'm writing to share my disappointing experience with Royal Brunei Airlines. My Melbourne flight was delayed by six hours, causing me to miss my connection. Despite assurances, the ground crew in Brunei couldn't assist, and I had to buy a new ticket and wait eight hours. I contacted the airline, but they acknowledged the delay without taking responsibility or offering compensation. This lack of accountability was staggering. While Royal Brunei claims to value feedback, my experience suggests otherwise. The food and service are average, and the cost savings aren't worth the potential hassle. I strongly advise against flying with Royal Brunei Airlines.

### "Very bad experience"
Very bad experience, we were travelling from Melbourne to Dubai. Plane got problem we were 3 hours inside the plane, after that they stated we will arrange bus to take you all inside lounge. It took 2 hours and after that 1 and half more hour took them solve the problem. Our flight was 1.30 pm and plan flew 8 pm. Airline refused to reimbursed even didn't give me good reply.

### "very attentive, cheerful, friendly"
I would like to sincerely thank flight Stewardess Irdina from royal brunei BI98 dubai to london (13/02/2025) for her excellent hospitality! She was very attentive, cheerful, friendly, helpful and professional. Other crew members also giving excellent service to the passengers. Thank you for making our flight more enjoyable, meaningful and memorable! Looking forward to fly RB again soon.

### "went above and beyond the call of duty"
Not Verified |  I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to your team, and particularly to Ruzia, for the exceptional service provided recently. She truly went above and beyond the call of duty when my parents accidentally left their bag at gate 16. I was extremely stressed and worried at the time, but she  handled the situation with such professionalism and reassurance. She took the time to look for the bag and kept me updated throughout the process. When the bag was found, I asked if it could be sent on the next flight. She followed protocol and checked with her superiors to see if this was possible. Not long after, she called back to confirm that it was indeed possible. The bag arrived safely at Heathrow on Sunday, with everything intact. My parents and I are incredibly grateful to she and your team for going the extra mile. Thank you once again for everything.

### “Excellent service”
I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation. Excellent service made me spend a pleasant and unforgettable time during my air journey. First of all, I would like to thank you for the safe and comfortable travel environment you provided me. Throughout the flight, the crew members maintained a high level of vigilance and professionalism. Their smiles, warm greetings and meticulous care made me feel the warmth of home.

### "deeply appreciate his assistance"
I am very grateful to Royal Brunei Airlines for helping me facilitate my last-minute return to Brunei. My husband and I were supposed to return to Brunei on November 25th, but because my sister passed away on the morning of November 24th, we had to return to Brunei immediately. At first, there were no available slots for a return flight, but one of the RB KUL crew, Mohad did everything he could to help me get back to Brunel. I am very thankful and deeply appreciate his assistance. If it weren't for his support, I wouldn't have had the chance to be there in time for my sister's burial. Good job RBA, and keep up the great work.

### "exceptional assistance"
While my arrival at Brunei Airport initially presented a frustrating situation due to a lack of prior communication about the INRS portal requirement, the exceptional assistance I received from one of the staff members, Mr Asnawi turned things around. Despite my frustration, he remained calm, professional, and incredibly supportive. His patience and understanding helped de-escalate the situation, and his dedication to assisting me ensured I could resolve the issue without further stress. It is rare to encounter such exceptional service, and he truly went above and beyond to make a difficult experience manageable. I commend Royal Brunei Airlines for having such exemplary staff who prioritize passenger well-being and customer satisfaction. This experience reinforced my confidence in the airline, and I would not hesitate to fly with Royal Brunei Airlines again.

### "cabin service is outstanding"
In spite of a delay of one hour at LHR the flight's to and from Australia were the most pleasant that I have made on this route. The cabin service is outstanding and my dietary requirements (diabetic) were met and were some of the best I have ever eaten. The cabin crew at all times were top class.

### "best airline I have flown"
The best airline I have flown is Royal Brunei, the best of all, with excellent customer care, and a flight crew with excellent and excellent machine cleaners. Thank you Brunei Airlines.

### "not take this airline in future"
Poor performance and service of ground staff in Singapore handling the baggage out from the aircraft very late and baggage running in conveyor belt very late. The air steward not happy to serve me more meals but asking others if they need more. I will not take this airline in future.

### "found out my baggage was missing"
Not happy with the service. I arrived at NAIA Terminal 1 August 31st and found out my baggage was missing. Upon arriving at NAIA, I waited at the baggage claim area as usual, but unfortunately, my baggage did not appear on the conveyor belt with the other passengers' luggage. After reporting the issue to your airport staff, I was informed that my baggage had been delayed and would be delivered to my address as soon as possible. I was promised it will be delivered September 2, no update yet. Customer service is not pro active. They are not calling me for the update. I understand that unforeseen circumstances can lead to baggage delays, but the extended delay in receiving my luggage caused me significant inconvenience and disrupted my travel plans.

### "Excellent customer service"
Not Verified |  Nice leg room. Excellent customer service. Fantastic on-board atmosphere. Good quality food. Variety of entertainment. First time I have flown this airline but it will not be the last.

### "a good value option"
Not Verified |  We flew three flights from Melbourne to London. This is the standard route for Royal Brunei, they fly approximately 7 hours from Melbourne to Brunei then 7 hours onward to Dubai and then 7 hours to London. This is obviously a few hours longer than a one stop flight. The flight attendants were great and the food tasted fine. Bring your own headphones because the supplied ones are awful. The seats are ok, nothing special. This airline is a good value option.

### "Good flight overall"
Good flight overall. This can be one of the cheaper options to fly from Dubai to London, partly to compensate for the awkward flight times (very late night/early morning, in order to line up with the onwards journeys to/from Brunei using the same aircraft) and limited frequency (currently only flies thrice weekly). The airline is 'dry' (does not serve alcohol) which can be an advantage in the sense of avoiding 'air rage' incidents caused by drunken passengers. Priority boarding for 'reserved seats' was adhered to. Two hot meals of good quality were served in the flight (the first was a slice of pizza served 40 minutes after take-off; the second was cooked breakfast 2 hours before landing), and an amenity kit (containing an eye mask and socks) was provided to economy class passengers. Inflight entertainment has a lot of options but is not easy to search and navigate and the quality of the sound from the headphones is low. Despite being the very first flight of the day to land at Heathrow Terminal 4, our luggage took almost an hour to arrive (this is the airport's fault, not the airline's).

### "Chaotic boarding at Brunei airport"
Chaotic boarding at Brunei airport, even though this is the airline's base and hub. Wifi doesn't work in the departure lounge and toilet facilities are old, wet, and needing refitting. Very limited options to eat and more shops were closed than open even though it was still early evening (before 7pm!) Priority boarding for Reserved Seats was not offered, even though it is advertised. They seem to struggle to be able to manage the boarding of large widebodied aircraft flights given the small size of the airport. Onboard the experience was fairly decent. Only one meal was served on this flight lasting almost 8 hours, as they presumed most people would sleep. No amenity kit was provided, though blankets and pillows were at each seat. Free toothbrushes offered in the economy class toilets. Cabin crew were well-trained, hardworking and polite. This airline is consistently sent to the far D gates in Dubai airport, entailing a long walk for passengers on arrival.

### "Great flight from start to finish"
Great flight from start to finish. Online check-in worked but without the facility to print a boarding pass at home. Ground staff were polite, although there was some problem with the ticket when checking in at Kuching airport which took a long time to resolve (the ground staff even rang Brunei for assistance). A light meal (sandwich) was served on this short flight. No headphones were distributed even though the aircraft had individual entertainment screens at each seat.

### "Unpleasant check-in experience"
Unpleasant check-in experience, which really spoiled the overall experience more than anything else. First of all, online check-in failed repeatedly and no help was forthcoming from the email address that the airline’s website FAQs directed questions on online check in errors to. (To this day I have never received a response to my email). Their online check-in system seems to be fundamentally broken since resumption of operations post covid. Therefore I went early to the airport (3 hours ahead of the scheduled flight time) for manual check-in but found a long, poorly-managed queue. The ground staff to whom Royal Brunei have subcontracted ground operations at Heathrow Terminal 4 were surly and disinterested. The particular lady who handled our check in was rude, asked the same question 3 times (because she wasn't paying attention to our answers or to her job) and was instead casually complaining to her colleague about not wanting to work overtime right in front of us, rather than just getting on with the task at hand. (It’s very unprofessional to discuss work gripes in front of customers whom one is supposed to be attending to at that moment). Priority boarding for Reserved seating was honoured, though you have to listen carefully for the rushed announcements or you'll miss the very short window given for priority boarding. Additional leg space for the Reserved seating was good, making the journey more comfortable. The flight took off almost two hours late, though the exact reason for this wasn’t made clear to passengers and we had to wait on board during the delay. Cabin crew were very polite and helpful, though overall the standard of service on Royal Brunei has declined compared to a decade ago. e.g. no amenity kits were provided for this flight, and only one meal was served on a seven and a half hour flight (LHR to DXB). It was tasty but the portion size was on the small side. Free snacks were available at the rear galley for those who went to get them, but the cabin crew almost never came round with drinks except once with the meal service. However, they did always respond attentively to calls and were friendly and efficient. The condition of the aircraft is very good. Complimentary toothbrushes were provided in the washrooms. Blankets and pillows provided for all seats. The entertainment system had a wide variety of options though some were quite obscure and the system is not easy to navigate or search through. Headphones were not distributed from London and I had to ask for them. They didn’t actually carry enough headphones for all passengers on this flight , which is shocking. Quality of the sound from the airline-supplied headphones was poor.

### "Good on-board service"
Priority boarding for Reserved seats was not honoured during boarding in Dubai, despite this being an advertised perk of paying more for such seats. The result was a rushed boarding experience. Good on-board service. Polite and hard-working cabin crew. 2 hot meals served and free snacks available from the galley during the flight. Luggage took a very long to come out on the conveyor belt at Brunei airport despite ours being the only flight to have landed at the time, and this being Royal Brunei's hub!

### "a decent experience"
Overall a decent experience with Royal Brunei and I would fly with them again. There was no sign of any of the horror stories that some other reviews talk about. The cabin was clean, crew were helpful and friendly, food was good (especially the warm croissants for breakfast) and IFE choice was enough for a 14 hour flight (although more language / subtitle options would have been appreciated). The biggest highlight was an overnight layover in Brunei in which we breezed through a really easy-to-navigate airport and spent a comfortable night in a hotel.

### "This lot make Ryanair seem comfortable"
This lot make Ryanair seem comfortable. Everything about this airline, it’s airport and sky “lounge” is third rate. Sure, you save money as it’s always one of the cheaper fares but you will have to carefully consider it it’s worth it. On board food is almost inedible. They take all your water bottles before you board (yes even after you have gone through a security scan!) and then you have to beg the two staff working the entire economy cabin for a cup of water any time you want a drink on a 8 or 16 hr leg. Thinking you might make the journey a little more bearable by buying the $49 sky lounge pass? Don’t bother. Grubby tiny lounge, with no edible hot food options, and barely edible cold sandwiches. Filthy toilets.

### "lack of customer service"
Appalled at the complete lack of customer service following a complaint. Prior to my 21 hour flight I purchased a better seat for £120 - only to then have a broken seat on the second 14.5 hour leg of the journey: resulting in being more uncomfortable than anyone else. I’ve reasonably requested the refund of the extra £120 I paid but all I’ve received is a meek apology.

### "screen had a fingerprint"
Bandar seri Begawan to Kuala Lumpur on 4th March. When I saw my seat with bread / or biscuit crumbs, I ask the cabin crew if i can have a napkin to wipe it off, but without hesitation, the female cabin crew uses her hand to wipe off the crumbs across my seat. I put on my seat belt, very shock to see the seat belt had a stain, IFE screen had a fingerprint and so does the window. I spoken to the crew about this incident and hopes the airlines are aware of the cleanliness.

### "no empathy or service assistance"
Not Verified |  In December 2019, My wife was travelling with my 3 young children using Royal Brunei Airline from Melbourne to Kota Kinabalu transiting at Brunei. Then with connecting flight (Malindo Air  Kota Kinabalu to Kuching. No Notification of flight delay We were only told of flight delay till 2130HR (vs original departure at 1845HR), after waiting in line for 45mins at Melbourne Airport to check in. We would appreciate if the airline could send us an advanced notification about the delay but NOT upon check in. We have arrived in Melbourne airport by 1520HR. Having the young children to wait at the airport for 7 hours till departing time 2230HR, without any assistance extended was not a good experience. Making matter worse, we were declined our request for a simple meal arrangement. This was not a very considerate and responsible gesture – as you can tell the delayed flight hour had passed the dinner time and we didn’t request for anything unreasonable. Poor arrangement on Connecting flight: We repeatedly express our concern of how this delay would impact our connecting flight,  ground staff reassured us that the delay will not affect the connecting flight to Kota Kinabalu. She affirmed that the flight will definitely wait for my family to connect to Kota Kinabalu as many passengers were transiting as well. It was obvious enough, from frequent traveling experience, having 30mins time to transit was quite impossible but we were once again reassured that we could make it. As expected, my family missed the connecting flight. My family was stranded and had to wait for the next available connecting flight to Kota Kinabalu at 2330HR on 11/12/2019 (vs original flight at 0030HR on 11/12/2019). As a result of above delay, the connecting flight from Kota Kinabalu to Kuching were forfeited, costing us extra expenses to purchase a new flight ticket. When venting our frustration with Brunei Airline ground staff, the lady tried to reassure us that they will try to help to get a reasonable reimbursement and even attempt to negotiate with Malindo air to reschedule a connecting flight from Kota Kinabalu to Kuching. My family were then quickly shoved onto a bus full of other waiting passenger to a complimentary hotel and asked to wait for the update but no phone calls or follow up message received. When we called up the next day, the airline staffs denied any arrangement or promise being made, and deterred all responsibilities. No apologies made. We were feeling helpless. The original trip was supposed to take only 1 day to reach the final destination but the whole journey was prolonged to 2 days in the end. Sadly, there was no empathy or service assistance throughout the whole journey, which made it even more painful to travel.

### "flight has been cancelled"
I am traveling from Jeddah to Bali using this airline for the first time and will be the last. Flight No. BI002 on 1st Feb 2020. Our flight had to land in Dubai due to a passenger critical health case which had him to be hospitalized urgently. However after waiting for long hours, we have been informed that flight has been cancelled, lost our transit flight and still waiting at Dubai airport for very long hours with big mess, no Hotel, no idea when is our flight. Thanks to Royal Brunei Airlines for making from our honeymoon bad experience.

### "changed to a small aircraft"
London to Melbourne via Brunei. Checkin procedure online was a shambles, with no wallet ticket available. The system broke three times whilst checking in. The first flight was fine, but the entertainment system was incredibly poor with most films being old and none of the recent releases. After landing in Brunei we were advised our flight had been changed to a small aircraft due to a “fault”. 7 hours stuck in a small seat and only 2 toilets is far from ideal. Since this flight I have contacted RB customer service several times. It’s taken a month to have a reply from them. They seem to have no issue with passengers poor comfort and service. They have simply stated that as the flight landed and we arrived safely that’s all that their charter covers - the fact that we had no room, delays and a horrific flight doesn’t seem to matter. My advice to anyone is avoid RB. Pay the extra money and go with a proper airline with a good reputation for customer service. Enjoy the service you would expect elsewhere.

### "substandard Business Class Service"
Not Verified |  We chose to fly Royal Brunei business class from Melbourne to Bangkok. The first bad experience was the lounge in Melbourne - the Maharajah Lounge. The food was old - stale and cold. Absolutely disgusting. Having boarded the aircraft for the Melbourne to Brunei Sector, and being directed to our business class seat, that was the only good thing about the flight. The service was shocking . The attention to detail by the unfriendly staff was surprising for a so called business class flight. The food selection that was offered on the menu was unavailable and I had to settle for an economy meal that was inedible compared to food on other airlines that we have used The remote control on the entertainment system did not work properly. The entertainment selection was extremely poor. The staff were nowhere on seen throughout most the flight. No offer of soft drinks or refreshments. The only good thing was the legroom on the seat. The last straw was the unfriendly way that we were asked to return the menu card given to us at the start of the flight. Rude staff who should be ashamed of themselves. The 12 hour layover at Brunei airport would have been extremely difficult had it not been for the staff in the Sky Lounge who helped arrange for a temporary transit visa so that we could stay in a hotel in Brunei for a short stay. In fairness, the short second sector from Brunei to Bangkok was better. The cabin staff were much more attentive and friendlier than our experience in the first sector. Overall, this was a substandard Business Class Service which did not represent good value for money. Sadly, I will have to endure the return trip on this disappointing airline.

### "never fly with them again"
Melbourne to London via Brunei on 11th January. The flight on the way there from London to Melbourne on the 28th December had a 1.5 hour stop over in Brunei delayed and changed to a 9 hour stop over, and we were only informed the day before the flight. Assuming there wasn’t enough people to fill my flight so they cancelled it and just forced the poor people who happened to be on the flight to a much later one. Tried to call customer service twice, expensive International calls because the local line was shut as it was a weekend and was told both times they would send over hotel and compensation details in a few hours .. 24 hours later I had to get on the plane with no information about what would happen on arrival and it ended up taking another 2 hours once there to even figure out where to put us with most of the staff not even knowing that the flight was even delayed at all. I thought it couldn’t get any worse and was hopeful on the return flight that I would get home on time but no such luck. Flew from Melbourne to Brunei without an issue then the flight took off from Brunei to London but within an hour had turned around and force landed back in Brunei. The staff at the airport had no idea and were not helpful in the slightest. There was no wifi to contact anyone to let them know with the exception on using a horribly connected hotspot from one of the staff for about 10 minutes. The airport was freezing and they said it would likely be around 8 hours before the flight could take off. They said they couldn’t put us into hotels as “there weren’t any available” so we were just expected to sit in the airport for all this time with no guarantee of the flight even leaving. The communication was so bad that no one ever knew what was actually happening or where to go, and unless you specifically went and searched the airport for the few and far between staff and asked them there was no information given. In the end we landed in London almost exactly 12 hours later than we should have. I cannot believe how bad the experience with Royal Brunei was and I will never fly with them again.

### "airline did not apologise"
Melbourne to London via Brunei in August 2019. The first flight was Melbourne to Bandar was meant to be a 787, and when we boarded it was an A320, claustrophobic and uncomfortable it was for a 7 hr flight. Trapped in narrow seats, with hardly any leg room. I upgraded at quite a cost to business class for this leg on my return flight as we did not want to undergo this again. Bandar to London was OK, very average and nothing much to comment, but the airline did not apologise for the inconvenience of the first leg, let alone making any amends. All in all not a good experience, and I would never fly this airline again .. just a 100-200 dollars cheaper than others. Not worth it.

### "but you dont have to yell"
Brunei to Tokyo. I was seated at 39. it was a full flight and when come to meal service, a male purser was offering my seat mate a choice of Fish and Beef. When come to my turn, he didnt ask me what would i like but asking me any drinks for you sir? Moments later my meal is given to me and i ask him what is the main course, he said its fish. As i have not fancied fish meal, i ask him what can i have. Heraise his voice at me, "we do not have the beef anymore, what we have left is fish". I told him i do not eat fish so ask if beef is available on the other cart? He is reluctant and without checking said this is full flight and we dont cater extras meal on board, its just fish we have left. do you want it or not! I told him to take back the fish meal and left me with the small portion of dessert that came with the set meal! I understand the meals are limited to selection especially when you seated in the middle section of the aircraft when meal serving are last, but you dont have to yell or speak loud to me when everyone needs to turn back and look at me. Its kind of embarrassing for that moment!

### "I was disappointed"
Dubai to Melbourne via Brunei. I was travelling with Royal Brunei for the last 5 years as they got a very good service but this time I was disappointed. Flight was delayed for 4 hours and only came to know about the delay when i reached the airport and then for 6 hours due to bad weather. I was waiting at the airport from midnight, they keep changing the gates and lots of confusion happened in between. At last the flight took off at 13:30 Pm. No one was offered any food or water for the delay. After the flight took off only got a small meal and a bottle of water. No juice or soft drink. I was expecting more food (as my experience in past) later but we didn't got anything and the crew was not helpful. The flight had less leg room. We land in Melbourne 8 hours late due to delay (11:45 am). Didn't  get much for breakfast and coffee. I was travelling with Royal Brunei from 2014, but all other times we got great service and this was so terrible.

### "definitely recommend Royal Brunei"
Brisbane to London via Brunei. I’m working as a paramedic in UK and must fly at least twice a year to Brisbane, where my children live. For the first time I used Royal Brunei and I was very impressed. The short lay over and small price determined me to use RBA. First impression was the humble and professional attitude of the staff, very clean planes, good leg room, amazing food. Crew walked the extra mile to accommodate passengers, me included and their service was amazing. The flight’ s attendants leaders on the Brunei-London leg took the time and listened to my feedback. Reintroduce the short lay over middle way between Brunei-London. I definitely recommend Royal Brunei.

### "airline was closed over the weekend"
Not Verified |  London to Melbourne via Brunei. Flight was good and crew were great. But upon trying to check in online I had noticed that my 4 year old daughter and 15 year old son were allocated seats away from me. When I tried to change seats nothing happened. Tried to contact my travel agent and she said that the airline was closed over the weekend. What sort of supposed international airline isn’t contactable 24/7? So now I had to wait till the last minute to sort this out. I thought that it was a duty of care that minors were seated with their parents? If you want customer service don’t fly Royal Brunei.

### "cabin crew very professional"
Melbourne to London via Bandar Seri Begawan. The plane was elegant, the cabin crew very professional and made a long flight more pleasant. The food was great. I have to say that Royal Brunei is my favorite airline. The planes are new, Brunei airport is fairly small and easy to get around and to check in or transit, while the ground staff is polite. The inflight entertainment is very good, but there are spaces for improvement. Toilets and planes are the cleanest.

### "demanded bag be placed in the locker"
Dubai to Manila via Brunei. Seating and food was good, as you'd expect in business class, but the real irritant was the business class steward on the final sector who demanded my shoulder bag be removed and placed in the locker. To be clear this was a small bag, secured around my neck with strap and hanging on the opposite side, so extremely well anchored to me and not by any definition was it a loose article. But you know how it goes when it turns officious.... she told me that it was a loose article yet the pillow and blanket packages in the empty cabin seats  were ok to sit unsecured on seats. The same again for landing. You can't argue with this attitude. Disappointing attitude, completely officious and illogical and for this hassle, I wouldn't go with RB again.

### "lacking in cabin crew services"
Bandar Seri Begawan to Kuala Lumpur. I must admit that Royal Brunei's service is excellent. Good on time performance, aircraft using a new fleet, exciting in-flight entertainment options, efficient check-in process. But to be honest I am a little lacking in cabin crew services, several times I had to call the cabin crew to ask for additional drinking water but it takes a long time for them to respond.

### "IFE not working"
Brunei to Kuala Lumpur. My seat at 43A, IFE not working, shortly all aircraft doors disarmed, I ask a female cabin crew if she can reboot my IFE. Inflight Entertainment System. She said later and walk straight away. 10 minutes after airborne, i ask her again if she has already done the restart, she looked  lost and said she is doing it now. another 10 minutes gone, i approached a senior cabin crew and I ask her if I can switch my seat to the front (as the back rows were full) and  told her my situation with the IFE. She is very reluctant to answer me that the front first three row (which is identical size to my seat but were reserved seat options) were for paying customer only. I told her if she can do anything for my as my IFE is not working. She said she will reboot the system. few minutes later, they start the inflight meal service. Crew were very busy doing meal services, so i just not be bothering asking anyone of them again. 15 minutes before touching down, iI went to the lavatory and saw the same crew again and I told her my IFE still not working. Without hesitation, she answered I have restart the system, if the system not responding, there is nothing I can do. A very disappointed cabin services.

### "I had a great experience"
I flew to Bangkok, Thailand from Surabaya, Indonesia with this airline for the first time. In my opinion, I had a great experience. The cabin crews are very kind and helpful. The seats are comfortable and I like the design as well. The food is tasty. There is enough legroom for me. Besides, I like the inflight entertainment since the movies are updated so it's not boring at all. The aircraft is clean and smart looking. However, it would have been much better if all the aircraft of Royal Brunei Airlines are equipped with personal inflight entertainment, not just overhead TV or WiFi connection because it would be so boring and not pleasant. Basically, I would like to recommend this aircraft to my friends and I would love to fly with Royal Brunei Airline again.

### "very happy with the service"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Bangkok via Brunei. I have flown twice now with Brunei business class and must say great airline and was very happy with the service and staff friendliness, terrific food as well. I also find the people of Brunei very friendly and welcoming. I am now a member of there frequent flyer program.

### "Horrific experience"
London to Melbourne via Brunei. Horrific experience. Travelling solo with a 15month old. I understand that he does not pay so doesn’t automatically get a seat. He sat on my lap for the first 15 hours. Staff offered no support with helping me with bags, to entertain him while I needed the toilet etc, they didn’t provide a meal for him, when I asked they told me I should have specially requested one. I asked for them to do this for the second leg of the trip- they didn’t. When asked if they could provide some fruit, I was told by one staff member ‘we only give it out at snack times to the adult passengers.’ The nappy change table is a weird oval shape and the babies legs hang over, setting the sensors for the tap off. It’s hard enough changing in limited space, but the nappy change table meant some creative yoga poses. The second leg the flight was half empty, my child was once again on my lap. I asked if I could move to the row in front so he could lay on the spare seat and we could both get some sleep. I was told no, that those seats you have to pay more for - they were identical to the one I was sitting on. I asked to speak to someone more senior who then agreed. There is no way i’ll be flying with Brunei again for the poor service. The airport is horrific, nothing to do. Basically no food to purchase other than chocolate and crisps. Go with someone else!

### "their response was nothing short of appalling"
Avoid this Airline at all costs for long haul flights. If you buy a ticket with this airline you only have yourself to blame when things go wrong. For the second time in 2 weeks Royal Brunei have cancelled their Brunei to London flight resulting in delays of more than 12 hours and hundreds of stranded passengers. They knew full well when we left Manilla that there was no serviceable aircraft waiting in Brunei and one was having to be flown in from Jeddah. Despite knowing they had 100 plus passengers arriving their response was nothing short of appalling. Staff giving contradictory info as to what next. Passengers left outside the terminal in the early hours of the morning to wait up to two further hours for 16 seat buses to get checked into a dirty smelling hotel with no food and water provided. Passengers in wheelchairs just dumped outside. The replacement flight was due to leave 11.45 next day this also delayed due to "technical difficulties" on a different 787. Ground staff could not care less, we had to argue for nearly 60 minutes just to get access to WIFI so we could update friends and family of our late arrival. To top it off despite having our bags in the airport overnight they did not join us when we eventually arrived in London. 28 hours to get from Brunei to London. I've been flying over 20 years and we've all had delays it's part and parcel of long haul travel. The difference here is how Royal Brunei conducted themselves both during and after. They should be absolutely ashamed of the way they treat their customers. Royal Brunei point blank refuse to compensate passangers. Lesson learned I guess, beter to pay that little bit extra and fly with a experienced long haul carrier that holds that 5 star rating.

### "directing my custom elsewhere"
Not Verified |  I'm a regular traveller to Europe and gave Royal Brunei Airlines a try based on price and a recommendation from our travel agent for a quick trip trip to Europe with my teenage son to attend a football game. Beware one may save some dollars over flying alternative airlines but you have to consider last minute changes and delays which appear to be a common thread travelling Royal Brunei Airlines. It's so true you really do pay for what you get. Melbourne London and return with Royal Brunei Airlines to travel around Melbourne Cup week. Booked business class, told 3 weeks later we would be flying on a 3rd party airline but don't worry it will have flat beds travelling on an A340 etc. Checked at Melbourne only to be told our first leg would be flying on an A320 with what could be best described at premium economy, not ideal for an overnight flight. All 4 flights to and from London were either late departing or late on arrival (in most cases both). A reasonable compensation proposal was forwarded to Royal Brunei Airlines  with the airline declining our request stating some of their standard T&C's. I will be directing my custom elsewhere and would advise anyone thinking of flying Royal Brunei Airlines to reconsider.

### "failed to show any understanding"
Our experience with Royal Brunei was appalling - we were given our boarding passes to fly from Manila to London via Brunei without any staff mentioning they knew there was a technical fault with our connecting flight so they had delayed the time on the boarding pass of the connecting flight by 3 hours. We arrive at Brunei and are left to wait 4 hours until 4.30am before anyone came to tell us there was a problem with the plane and we couldn’t fly. They advised they’d organise accommodation in Brunei and we would fly at 10am. By 7am we are finally in a hotel after waiting hours to be checked in as Royal Brunei had not contacted them in advance. One hour later we were expected to leave and return to the airport. At the airport we were denied entry into the Royal Brunei lounge despite having entry cards as you can’t re-enter within 24 hours even though they forced us to leave the airport. And the best part - our 1 hour in a hotel was considered our compensation in full for what was a 12+ hour delay and no food or water was offered at all in this time. Avoid at all costs, they failed to show any understanding of what was going on and gave us no direction on when to leave the hotel etc. Pay more, fly another airline, you won’t regret it.

### "I have to request that when I booked"
Brunei to Taipei on A320 on Business Class with my Infant child. At the J class check in desk, Is waited for over 15 min before they check me in. At check in, I had a baby stroller and requested to check in, and the check in staff told me to leave it at the over size baggage area, I asked if can someone help me he is reluctant and shout at one of the desk baggage helper to move my baby stroller. Visited the Sky Lounge, a big disappointment, it was morning and there were a very limited selection of breakfast, and there were only two main course (and the serving was left 20% ). No waiter were to be seen and cleanliness around buffet area was poor. Onboard the crew were very polite and the aircraft is new. a disappointed with J class seat, not a full recliner and for the IFE, very limited selection with older films. They served my meal when my child went to sleep, but when he wakes up, i ask for an infant or child meal, but the crew told me I have to request that when I booked my flight. So I feed my child with the biscuit I brought with me. I ask for a bread roll, the crew said they have none left. It was a 3hr 15 min flight, during the half journey, my child want to walk around and i was told by crew "For the Safety, please keep your child seated". we were in a J class and there were only 2 others passenger in this cabin.

### "the best long haul flight"
London to Melbourne via Brunei. This was our first time for myself and my partner travelling with Royal Brunei. We were a little apprehensive but it was the best long haul flight we have had in a long time. Great customer service, planes were in good condition and flew smoothly, good food, lots of seat space. All in all a great journey. The price was £1000 cheaper per person than any other airline at the point of booking. I would highly recommend Royal Brunei.

### "good and comfortable airline"
Not Verified |  London to Manila via Brunei. Very good and comfortable airline. So much leg room in the plane. Food was amazing and cabin crew were very polite. Cheap ticket. Would definitely fly with Royal Brunei Airlines again. They don’t serve alcohol during the flight though and no smoking area at Brunei airport which is a downside but won’t hinder me from flying with them again.

### "Misleading and poor service"
Brunei to Singapore. Misleading and poor service. I purchased an economy ticket. A week before my flight, i received an email if i would like to purchase an upgrade. Hence, after reviewing i made an offer with few hundred dollars. Couple of days later, they accepted my offer and charged to my card. My check in flight went smoothly, and proceed to departure gate. I was holding a Business Class boarding card, so i went to the Business Class lounge at the departure hall, after entering the lounge, a receptionist looks very reluctant and I ask her if I can visit the lounge with my upgraded ticket, without any hesitation, she answer very rudely and say 'No'. So I ask her again if my frequent flyer Silver can be used here, she just said I have to pay. So, i have to walk away embarrassingly with other 'real' business class pax behind me. After security check, i proceed to the aircraft, i was given a window business class seat, but I was surprising to find out, this is not the kind of business class seat i paid for. I was offered a larger and much comfort with longer leg room seat on my email ( with pic shown ), but they have not mentioned the business class seat picture was taken from a B787 aircraft.the sector flown was an A320 aircraft. The business class seat was smaller, when front pax seat reclined (and its not a flat bed as advertised ), it took out much of my forward space and I have to consistently adjust my IFE when the seat in front make any movements. The service was not that expected on a business class level, the crew did not address the name of the pax, drink service only once offered, special meal request not mentioned but to serve directly to me. when meal served, did not ask pax if drinks need to top up or offered. overall, not the type of the business class level / service that i was expected. Imagine if i was paying a full business class fare, this would have been not worth it!

### "ability to provide better"
On my first leg from Bandar seri Begawan to Singapore on a new A320Neo aircraft, the cabin was very fresh and clean. The flight leave on time with no issue, but the IFE was not working. Shortly after take off, the IFE was not working, i tried to inform the crew about it, but the senior crew was busy chatting with the crew in the back galley. 30 minutes later, i told one of the crew about the IFE, he said he will inform his superior. On my way back from Jakarta to BWN, a new A320Neo, once again everything seems good about the cabin, the IFE was working before the aircraft push back from the stand in CGK. Took a little time to browse the IFE. I fly with RB every month since July. The TV guide and other movie list / channel has never been change or refresh. The movies and TV channel were very out dated and its getting bored to watch the same film or tv program again and again. I finally get the chance to select a movie and the flight into an hour later, the IFE restart itself! I think this airlines has the ability to provide better products and the services, including the crew (dealing with problems) need more training in customer service.

### "staff could not be faulted"
I travelled from London to Melbourne via Dubai and Brunei in 26 hours and returned Melbourne to London via Brunei in 23 hours. I thought the return flight was scheduled to stop at Dubai (3 flights of approx 7 hours each on way out was a very easy way to travel) so my concerns of travelling on a 14 hour flight was turned on it’s head. As we flew out of Melbourne in the evening we chased the night. The whole journey back was in darkness so it was ideal to sleep whenever you wanted. Last time I travelled with Royal Brunei (6 years ago) was not a great experience. This time it was so much improved. The comfort of the reclining seat and back rest was good for economy. The food was better than most plane food although not excellent. My last trip to Melbourne on Cathay Pacific three years ago was an awful experience in food and staff. The staff on Royal Brunei could not be faulted. They were attentive and helpful always with a smile. The journey was not interrupted by constant messages from the captain so it was relaxed and peaceful. The toilets were always clean. Downside was that there was not a great choice in new films. I had seen most films on offer as they were older films. The strict rules of Brunei airlines means that films are adapted to remove sex, bad language and too much violence. This obviously restricts choices. Secondly, the plane running from Brunei to Melbourne and back is not a Royal Brunei but a partner airline. All was much the same but the plane was older and Seats did not recline as well as the Royal Brunei plane and it only had a few film choices (less than 10) which were the same on both outward and return flights. On my outward journey, fatigued, I managed to leave my Kindle Fire on the plane. After landing at Melbourne I contacted Royal Brunei thinking that I would never see it again. Within a week they contacted me and told me it was at Brunei and I could collect it on my return. When I arrived at Brunei on the way back I was helped by a wonderful lady who personally took me to Lost and Found and sorted out the return of my Kindle. As there was a fast turnaround time of about 40 minutes between flights. She deserves a special mention as I don’t think anybody in any other airport would be as kind and helpful as she was. I paid £660 for the return flight which I felt was best available. For the money I can’t fault it. I have travelled back and forwards to Australia 9 times in the last 18 years and this 23 hour return is the fastest yet.

### "Budget (at best) in actuality"
Business class Flew from Melbourne to London. Aircraft - old and very outdated internal fit out, down to the entertainment technology. Latest movies is a loosely used term. No movies currently showing at the cinemas are available - in fact, nothing ‘new’ from the past few years, apart from 1 (‘Adrift’) . Food - above average if we had been travelling in economy, below for Business Class. Flight attendants - as always, it’s a mixed bag. First leg the crew were almost military-like in their procession of serving and clearing away the meal in record time. And then the only time they were seen was when they performed almost half hourly cleans in the toilets (not complaining about that). Second leg it’s hard to comment as I was asleep for most of it although it was quickly obvious that the staff in charge of cleaning the toilets were no longer onboard as they were not in a great condition when I went to freshen up after my nap. Final leg - not outstandingly good or bad - but service crew who ‘refreshed’ the plane during the stopover in Dubai. Missed the toilets (NB 2 hrs out from London and no one has cleaned them since Brunei). Overall, it feels like the staff who serve in Business Class find it a nice treat to have a smaller area to work within but none were particularly motivated to assist with making the journey ‘special’ for passengers. Right down to the distribution of the ‘fast track’ pass through customs. My travelling partner was somehow recorded as travelling on a UK passport so ineligible. Despite clarifying that it was actually an Australian passport and a mistake by the airline, there was ‘nothing they could do’ because there was only a specific allocation of these cards! Seats fully recline as promised. Rock hard and unforgiving in any co figuration. There is a seat massager - didn’t work on any of out seats in any leg of the journey. Passenger amenities - no effort out into these packs. They are almost as good as what is distributed to economy passengers on other airlines. Socks, ear plugs and an eye mask that smells so much of the plastic it is made from you cannot wear it for any length of time. The blankets were thin and inadequate. Overall - Royal by name. Budget (at best) in actuality.

### "definitely worth the extra"
Got upgraded via the online offer system - paid just under 1/2 of the fare to fly Business class so I understand that my review is not for the full fare on this route. This was my only experience flying anything besides economy class - so I don't really have much to compare it too. Upon boarding I got the rearmost row to myself, as there were only three other people in the cabin. The most noticeable thing was the lack of an IFE system in the seat, instead you get given an iPad (in a rather nice RB branded case) with a selection of films and TV shows. The quantity of content wasn't as comprehensive as Emirates or Qantas, however what was there was good - and easily enough for a ~2h flight. Might be worth mentioning that the particular episode of a TV show I ended up watching was censored pretty heavily - I've seen lines being cut before but it makes you wonder what the point of having a show like that is if most of the comedy has to be cut/blurred out. The main point I would like to really commend on is how welcome I felt, as a backpacker who just wanted to try Business for the experience on the cheap I really appreciate how despite obviously not belonging there (considering how well dressed the other passengers were) the cabin crew made it seem normal and relaxing. Even though I didn't get to use the lounge in Singapore it was definitely worth the extra for that flight - however the economy on their A320's isn't too much of a downgrade for me at least, especially considering it would have been nearly 3x cheaper than the full business fare.

### "good feeling when flying RBA"
Dubai to Melbourne via Bandar. I flew this airline after 10 years since I flew them. Check in was easy despite that the plane was full. Seat of the 787 was really comfortable & fine leg room, entertainment system was just fine & serves the purpose perfectly. Brunei Airport was refurbished, still cosy, however, I think it needs a bit of Duty Free feeling to it rather than a small bazaar shops they have. No complaint on that. The only thing I hate about this airport is the fact that the Smoking room was closed for maintenance. Brunei to Melbourne flight, again, no issues, on time departure, meal was good (choose their regular meal as the vegetarian meal was really bad as many passengers who order it didn't bother eating it), landing was on earlier than the scheduled time, so it give me plenty of time to stretch out, smoke, eat & check in to my domestic flight to Sydney. What I love the most about them that they always manage to takeoff on time & land earlier than scheduled. All in all, a very good feeling when flying RBA.

### "definitely fly them again"
Melbourne to Hong Kong via Bandar Seri Begawan. Great service at check in at Tullamarine then a bit of a search for what was a pretty basic lounge. Boarding was easy and the crew to BSB were fantastic. Meal was good and if you wanted anything they were there very quickly. We were staying overnight in BSB and were not told that we had to pay $5 each for a visa but at least we got a nice stamp in our passport. Flight from BSB was on an A320 and again very comfortable and great service. On return from Hong Kong to BSB the lounge at HK was excellent as was the business lounge at BSB. Crew on this flight also very good. Then again only 4 of us in business class. Boarding the 787 to Melbourne was a bit clumsy at the gate. Told by a passenger next to me who had been on the flight from London that my seat was broken and would not go flat. Found this to be true but in the end 3 crew members jumped all over it and got it sorted. The meals were good. Didn’t miss the grog. While the crew seem to disappear they do respond quickly if you buzz them and nothing is too much trouble. Would definitely fly with them again.

### "never fly this airline again"
London to Dubai. I checked my luggage in at around in between 3pm to 4pm my flight was leaving at 5pm, my case was over by 3 kilos and staff informed that I must go and take the extra out which I did. I went back to her, and staff stated that I was 1kg over and if I wanted the extra kilo I would need to pay. Staff on the other side called me and told me to put my case for her to weigh which I did and the weight was 27 kilos. Because of the discussions about the weight of my case I was unable to buy any duty free because of the hold up. I have flown with this airline many times, and have never encountered a problem before. After this experience I will never fly this airline again. I like the people from Brunei and the cabin staffon the flight.

### "crew were warm and welcoming"
Bangkok to Melbourne via Brunei. For this journey, Royal Brunei offered an all inclusive fare (seat allocation, meals, bag) at a great price. This review relates to the return Bangkok - Melbourne. The first leg from Bangkok to Brunei on an older A320 was OK. Then three hours in Brunei, made quite pleasant by the newly renovated airport which feels airy and spacious, if a little sombre. I find the lack of alcohol on the planes and at the airport in Brunei quite refreshing, so this wasn't a concern for me. Seats on the 787 overnight flight to Melbourne were comfortable, even for a taller person, made better by the fact that the plane was only around half full, and the fact that the very considerate person in front of me never reclined her seat. I have never travelled on a full 787, so cannot comment on how comfortable the 9 across format would be on a full plane. My special meal was very nicely prepared, and the crew were warm and welcoming, doing water/juice runs, as well as a snack run (sweet or savoury) towards the end of the flight. I spent most of the nights watching movies from a reasonable selection of US and foreign language films. Only major problem - at no time did I see any member of crew cleaning the toilets, and more than an hour before landing the floor of the nearest toilet was disgusting - a deal breaker for me.

### "comfortable travel experience"
Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City via Bandar seri Begawan. Royal Brunei Airlines provided comfortable travel experience, the services are excellent and you get a chance to stop over to visit Brunei with friendly people and explore the natural wonders of the island.

### "staff were so polite and pro-active"
London to Bandar seri Begawan via Dubai. I was so pleased but the service and hospitality being given to us. The cabin staff were so polite and pro-active to provide service and help. Foods and drinks were supplied adequately. I strongly recommend travellers to take an experience of flying from it.

### "lack of consistency disappointing"
Bangkok to Melbourne via Bandar Seri Bagawan. You’d swear this was a different airline. It started ok though. Check in was quick and we had an express pass through security and immigration which was a blessing. We had a pass given to us for the Air France lounge, Oh my trying to find this was a huge challenge, they really need better signage in this massively large busy airport. Fortunately the lounge wasn’t far from the gate, The flight to Bandar Seri Bagawan was unremarkable, nice food and comfortable, On arrival in BSB we walked to transfers to be met and told our plane was in the UK with a cracked windscreen and that our Melbourne flight was postponed. The staff were very good and had pre filled immigration forms for us, walked us through there and put us in a taxi to a hotel for the night with a voucher for a meal there. The same taxi driver met us in the morning and took us back to the airport. Went to the lounge for breakfast and eventually a plane arrived, we heard it came from Jeddah. The flight home however was disappointing, there were only nine of us in business yet staff were hard to find, they seemed to run to the back a lot, We were told brusquely - get your trays ready, meals will come soon. We got the first and second course then nothing. Pillows were distributed, no duvet. Entertainment was extremely limited, It felt like a different airline to our outgoing experience. I did ring the call bell for a tea later on. Nothing was ever offered during the flight. The lack of consistency was disappointing overall. We arrived finally, our bags were not long to arrive.

### "Delightful experience overall"
Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh cCty via BandarSeri Bagawan. Delightful experience overall. Checking in was quick and easy with express passes for departure, lounge access at Cathay Pacific lounge in Melbourne and pass for the lounge in Brunei. We were permitted 40kg which apparently can be spread over multiple bags. Boarding was confusing as they call up families and business at once so you are in a line boarding as many families were travelling it seemed. Our seat on the plane was very spacious but we couldn’t have any bags stowed near us, all had to be put in the locker. We were offered juices/water prior to take off. Menus were distributed and the staff during this first leg were fabulous. Very friendly, they referred to us by name. The entertainment selection was very good. The food was superb, the steak ordered was very tender and the quantity of food ensured we were well and truly satisfied yet there were snacks available also. We had to go through security again to board our next flight. The flight from Bandar Seri Bagawan was on a smaller plane and it was late arriving thus late leaving. The staff were not as friendly on this section but we still got fed a sizeable main meal. All in all it was a positive experience and one I would love to do again.

### "all for a reasonable price"
Melbourne to London via Dubai. Royal Brunei were brilliant. For economy I didn’t expect a lot but seats were comfy, in flight entertainment was great, food was good, staff fantastic, and all for a reasonable price. Allowed 30kg for luggage which was more than enough I only had 14kg on me which meant I had plenty of room. I will be flying with Royal Brueni again I couldn’t find another airline with a better price or deal for the long haul.

### "handling a delayed flight"
Jakarta to Bandar seri Begawan. My first trip with this airline i really enjoyed in cabin, even though the flight was delayed 4 hours. Best ground staff and very good for handling a delayed flight. they treated passengers in good service. Cabin crew nice and polite and meals on board fantastic

### "value for money "
Melbourne to Bangkok return. This Royal Brunei Airlines flight is through Brunei and Melbourne to Brunei is on the Boeing 787 and then an Airbus from Brunei to Bangkok. All flights left on time or were early on arrival. My luggage was amongst the first off and I was given a Priority Pass for leaving Melbourne and for arrival and departure from Bangkok. Between Melbourne and Brunei and for the return sector the Business Cabin was full. Very good food for all meals with reasonable sized portions. I would have preferred earlier serving of the meal on the Brunei - Melbourne sector so that I could have had more sleep. The cabin attendants were helpful and efficient. The seats were comfortable and the B787 was a flat bed. On the shorter sector it was a reclining seat with a reasonable recline and good space for my legs. IFE was a bit limited and there should have been more choice in the array of films that were offered. I regularly fly from Melbourne to Bangkok and nearly always fly with Royal Brunei - they do not serve alcohol (Brunei is an Islamic country) but the level of service and the value for money is very good.

### "thoroughly enjoyed my flight"
I thoroughly enjoyed my flight from Melbourne to Dubai with Royal Brunei Airlines. The service was impeccable, food was delicious and the cabin was surprisingly very comfortable for economy class. I was also impressed by the dimming tinted windows. I was under the impression that we were flying through the night as they were dimmed. Once I automatically untinted the window, I realised that we were actually flying through daylight. Overall, it was an enjoyable flight.

### "respectful and courteous"
I found the seats to be very hard and uncomfortable for a long haul flight from Melbourne to Heathrow via Brunei with Royal Brunei Airlines. We ended up sitting on our slightly inflated neck pillows - that helped a little. Leg room in front was OK but the seats were very narrow. If a passenger in front reclined it made it difficult to eat from the tray and to view the screen. The meals were pretty good on the first leg but then went downhill from there. They were a little better on the way home from London. Food was plentiful and delivered with a smile. Due to there being no alcohol served the toilets remained clean and there was never a queue for them so the noise level within the aircraft was always at a minimum - even the babies were great. The customer service was outstanding - very respectful and courteous. They are happy to help in anyway they can. Brunei airport is very basic and very hot. I don't think they like to use air conditioning and the lights were kept low.

### "satisfied with the service"
Bandar seri Begawan to Manila. I'm very satisfied with the service. My hand luggage was 13kg, and usually they accept 7kg at maximum. Anyway they allowed me to bring it, otherwise I would have to pay for another luggage. The food was usable, but sadly no entertainment. Royal Brunei open the boarding 1h before take off, which makes it possible to have a earlier take off (happend to me both times I was flying RB).

### "had a pleasant experience"
Dubai to London. I had a pleasant experience with Royal Brunei Airlines, comfortable seats, good food, a good selection of movies in the IFE. All round good customer service. For the price I paid it took me to my destination, nothing fancy like some of the other airlines flying to and from Dubai.

### "good value for money"
❎ Unverified |  Flew Royal Brunei Airlines from London to Melbourne via Dubai and Brunei based on price alone, and pleasantly surprised by the service provided. Food was generally good, entertainment good and staff very pleasant. Dry aircraft was not an issue and indeed stops a lot of unpleasantness evident on some other flights due to passengers consuming too much alcohol. The stop in Dubai is a bit of a nuisance but allow you to stretch your legs. Seats are okay but get a bit hard after many hours but no worse than others. Overall good value for money and would use them again. Brunei airport is not very good but okay for a couple of hour stop.

### "wouldn't travel this airline again"
This flight was sold to us as one stop. However, there were in fact 2 stops. London Heathrow to Bandar seri Begawan stopping in Dubai, and we later connected to Bali. This should have been sold as 2 stops as it is misleading to say it's one and very wrong. We wouldn't have bought this flight if we had known. Brunei BWN airport has nothing in it. We had an 11 hour stop over which was torture. There are no restaurants or bars in the departures lounge and the whole airport smells of urine, partly due to the revolting toilets. Onboard the flights, the evening meals were tasty. Choice of chicken or beef (chicken lasagne / stir fry ginger beef - chicken chausseur / beef biriyani). Lunch was a disgusting and sour lemon chicken wrap that repeated on you. Breakfast was disgusting chicken sausage or beef sausage with a vile baked egg style thing. Due to being an airline based in a Muslim country, this is a dry airline and all food is halal. A 2 minute long prayer is said before each take off which is quite in your face for people that don't follow Islam. Seats are reasonably comfy - ok leg room. In flight entertainment was good, quite recent films. The cabin crew were very attentive and polite. I wouldn't travel with this airline again.

### "comfortable and clean enough"
Surabaya to Bangkok return via Bandar Seri Begawan. The planes are comfortable and clean enough while cabin crew are polite and friendly. I was disappointed by the fact that on three of the four flights they ran out of one of the meal choices before they even served half the passengers. (quality of the meal was good for short-haul). Another negative with Royal Brunei is the fact it is a dry airline so no alcohol can be served. If it changed this policy, it could be far more competitive. My fare was over US$200 cheaper than Garuda and Singapore Airlines, so I got very good value for what I paid.

### "no RBA ground staff to be seen"
I flew RBA from Kota Kinabalu to London via Bandar seri Begawan and Dubai on 30 December 2016. We experienced a delay in Dubai for almost 16 hours due to fog in the UAE. I understand that this is beyond the control of RBA. However, the appalling situation was that there was no proper communication and no RBA ground staff in Dubai airport to assist stranded passengers. Either the RBA staff have taken off their uniform not wanting to face the frustrated customers, I'm not entirely sure but they cannot be identified at all. We arrived into Dubai at approximately 1.30 a.m. from Brunei and have been stranded until 5.20 p.m on 31 December 2016. With such a long delay, we should have been given a hotel. We were also not given any meal voucher, but was told to go to either McDonald's or KFC for meals. Upon reaching the McDonald's counter, I was told I could only choose either a beef or chicken meal! But I am a vegetarian and I was told they could not help me without RBA authorisation. But there was no RBA ground staff to be seen! I was supposed to reach London at about 6.40 a.m. on new year's eve to celebrate the countdown with my wife and children, but we only arrived at 9.30 p.m. into Heathrow. As I live in Somerset, I only reached home at 12.30 a.m. on new year's day to a disappointed family! I thought RBA has improved with the service after many years for not flying with the airline, but I now feel I have made a terrible terrible mistake in choosing RBA once again with this trip.

### "not choose to fly RBA again"
Melbourne to Hong Kong return via Bandar Seri Begawan. Outbound from Australia to Brunei there were just four passengers in Business Class, yet when I submitted my meal preference (not two hours into the flight) I was advised that it was unavailable and asked to choose something else. I accepted that reality at the time and emailed Royal Brunei Airlines after our trip to complain. No acknowledgement or response, ever - nothing. Two years later, and two issues about which I sought to engage the airline. Outbound from Brunei for Hong Kong I was unimpressed by the torn and ragged seat upholstery facing me on the back of the two seats ahead of us. I wrote to RBA about this and another matter. Again, the response was nothing. Six months later I finally manage to drag them into communication, and although the response was ‘professional-polite’, I had clearly become their serial-pest, not a customer deserving of respect. To the ‘other matter’. Upon being called to board the late evening Brunei-Melbourne flight, we followed instructions to proceed to Gate. It turns out that Gate was at the furthest end of one of their new finger piers. We walked down the totally empty pier to its farthest extremity and sat in the boarding lounge. After about 20 minutes, the staff showed up and beckoned us through the gate for a boarding check. We were then directed to walk all the way back along the totally empty finger pier to the terminal hub from whence we’d come, where we found our boarding gate was open and we could proceed onto the aircraft. I asked the airline to explain this piece of silliness. Over a series of responses I was told ‘A lot of international airports require you to walk a long distance’ (perhaps so, but not in order to return to where you started), and ‘RBA does not own the airport and has no control over the airport administration’s requirements’ (a pitiful excuse considering BWN is the primary airport in the nation of Brunei and is the home base for RBA), and finally ‘The Australian government has security requirements that caused this’. I am unhappy because it takes you half a year to drag the airline into communication, you are admonished for not having complained to the cabin crew at the time (the crew had adequate opportunity to notice the cabin furnishing damage but obviously had not),  you are lied-to regarding the reasons some particular passenger management action has occurred, you are not a satisfied customer. We have disposed of our Royal Skies membership cards and will not choose to fly Royal Brunei Airlines again.

### "I wanted to say thank you"
Melbourne to Hong Kong via Bandar seri Begawan. I have been treated excellently even I can only afford to pay for economy class for myself and my daughter. This is such an amazing treat that I have ever been to any airlines. I wanted to say thank you to Royal Brunei Airlines, to the flight attendants. The food and drinks provided are very generous and great quality.

### "good deal - if you have flexible plans"
Melbourne to London via Brunei and Dubai. The deal with flying Royal Brunei is more complicated than flying other airlines. The flying experience on the 787 is excellent - great legroom for an economy seat , good food served every flight. IFE is OK - take your own headphones. Crew are very good. The price is very low compared to other airlines. However, this is a small airline with no back up plan if things go wrong - and they do. We had a 13 hour delay in Brunei but met people who were delayed several days. RB put us into a basic 3 star hotel for the night and organised a pretty poor evening meal but a meal nontheless. We also travelled with people who had experienced this sort of delay several times. RB is a good deal - if you have flexible plans - delays in Brunei especially are not uncommon but not that hard to deal with if you do not have to be somewhere at a particular time. The extra night in Brunei helped with jet lag but wasnt really in or plans.

### "Can't fault the airline"
London to Denpasar via Dubai and Bandar seri Begawan. Travelled as a family of four including two children aged 10 and 7 years old. Was slightly concerned about entertaining the children on such a long flight, but needn't have worried. The IFE kept my two children entirely entertained when they weren't sleeping. Both children took a rucksack full of books, pens etc, but I don't think they used any. Food was fine for us adults, sadly the children didn't like what they were offered, luckily we'd taken snacks on board and eaten well at the airport before boarding. Took our own wine as the airline is dry, staff happy to dispose of empty bottles. Seats were very comfortable, one of the best we've experienced. Cabin interior clean, staff friendly and very efficient, and happy to hand out extra brackets when my daughter was cold. Families boarded first on all flights. Can't fault the airline, especially given the cost when compared to others. Will happily travel as a family with them again.

### "food was good and filling"
Flew on Royal Brunei new A320ceo for a short flight from Brunei to Kuala Lumpur. Managed to try the new IMPIAN wireless entertainment system - not many choices but adequate for the short 2 hour flight. I think many passengers are not aware of this as RB only officially launched this service 1-2 months ago. Food was good and filling for a short flight. Asked for a pen and postcard and got a RB branded pen with some postcards in a nice writing kit (with some writing papers and envelope).

### "flew due to cheap costs"
Dubai to London Heathrow. No alcohol so take your own. Flight okay, however don't sit near the back of the plane as the crew sit there all night nattering away. Food pretty poor. TV and films were below par due to the amount offered. Only flew with Royal Brunei Airlines due to cheap costs.

### "cabin attendants polite and welcoming"
Flew Bangkok to Melbourne via Brunei with Royal Brunei. Both flights departed and arrived on time. The check in in Bangkok was efficient and polite and was able to use the priority lane for security check and Immigration. I boarded both flights at leisure and given priority in boarding. Bangkok to Brunei the cabin was lightly loaded and I was given an I-pad with some films on it. I was reading a book so did not see what was available. The seat recline was adequate and was comfortable. From Brunei to Melbourne the cabin was completely full and the seat fully reclined to a flat bed and was very comfortable. The inflight entertainment was adequate but film selection was a bit limited. On both flights the quality and quantity of the food was excellent, although on the Melbourne to Bangkok I did not get the main I wanted and decided to use the soup (would have been better if it were a bit hotter. Royal Brunei is a dry flight so no alcohol (this was a problem on the flight) so drink selection is a little limited. The Cabin attendants on both sectors were courteous, friendly and provide excellent service. My luggage was one of the first of the flight in Melbourne. I usually fly twice a year to Bangkok with Royal Brunei and the service quality tends not to vary. Flights usually depart and arrive on time and the cabin attendants are always polite and welcoming.

### "why do they mislead customers"
London to Kota Kinabalu via Bandar seri Begawan. Royal Brunei Airlines cancelled our connecting flight from Brunei to Kota Kinabalu by reasoning "there is no flight available". Why do they mislead customers through advertisement stating that there are flights available on the date and time of our travel plans when we paid you with our hard earned money? We paid it well in advance and Royal Brunei Airlines mercilessly gave us less than 24 hours notice that our connecting flight now is not available. I am travelling with an infant and a six year old boy and they expect me to travel in the middle of the night and expect somebody will wait for us on a red carpet and collect us in the middle of the night? Why do they put us through a lot of trouble, time and money spent just because of their mess? Do they know how difficult it is to travel with young children or have any idea why not to live up to their motto "better fly with Royal Brunei Airlines"? I am not happy. I would give no stars at all but I have no choice but to click one.

### "staff are ultra attentive"
Royal Brunei Airlines Business Class ticks every box. Flew from Melbourne to London via Dubai and Brunei. The Dreamliner is a great aircraft, the BC configuration has only 18 seats that recline to a flat bed, staff are ultra attentive, food is great, inflight entertainment is fine (without being over extensive). It makes top class Business Class travel affordable for so many more people.

### "B787 a wonderful aircraft"
Flew Dubai to Denpasar Bali via Brunei return. Refreshing cabin, cabin crew friendly and great. B787 is a wonderful aircraft in terms of comfort. IFE had sufficient content for an 8-10hr flight and was good in response. Food was superb. On the shorter route, I flew the new A320, very clean and fresh. However, lacked in IFE. Short Transit a breeze at BWN airport, but not if you are entering Brunei for a long transit. You'll have to first go to the transfer desk, request a sponsor letter, following which you pay 5 Bruneian $ for transit visa. Hotel provided was Trader's Inn, Brunei - comfortable for a transit stop. There seems to be some miscommunication between airline ground staff and immigration. If this is sorted it would be great. I have taken 8 flights in total with the airline, had a great time every time.

### "really cheap and not that bad"
Melbourne to Kota Kinabalu via Bander seri Begawan on Royal Brunei. The Boeing 787 Business Class was superior than I thought it was going to be. Yes they don't serve any kind of alcohol, however it's possible to buy a small bottle in Duty Free after security and bring it on the plane with you. The crew will not serve it to you, however ask for a mixer and ice and do it yourself! The seats laid down to a flat bed, and at 6ft 4inches roughly, it was just a little short to lie on my back (I'm 6ft 7). However with a bit of adjustment I was able to get comfortable and sleep. The only negative thing about the seat was the headrest - it's not moveable in any direction. This makes relaxing in a z shape almost impossible. Food was good, on the flight from Australia, they served a variety of Australian inspired dishes, and on the return more arabic influenced fare. Crew were quick to respond to drink requests etc. Decent sized portions as well! You don't get a decent amenity kit, and it resembles something from economy class, with an eye mask, ear plugs and that's about it. No PJ's either. However it is really cheap and not that bad for the money spent.

### "hard to criticise"
Melbourne to Heathrow via Brunei and Dubai with Royal Brunei. For a relatively small airline and with very competitive prices, this airline provide a standard that is hard to criticise. Yes, some may not like the 2 stops on this route and no alcohol policy but plenty of others are quite ok with this. When you take into account the new aircraft, 787's with 3-3-3 seating, reasonable food, plenty of other drinks served, pleasant staff and 30kg baggage allowance on this route, overall thie product is worth considering - I would certainly use them again. Seats have good room although a little hard as any seat would be after three 7 to 8 hour flights, reasonable entertainment system and Bandar Seri Begawan airport is showing signs of growth and improvement with more services.

### "incredibly low price"
Melbourne to London via Bandar seri Begawan and Dubai with Royal Brunei Airlines. Overall a very good experience for an incredibly low price. Outbound at check-in we were offered emergency exit seats for all three legs at no charge - a major bonus for me, being over six foot. Staff were attentive and reasonably friendly, seats comfortable, meals ok and the Boeing 787 really is a up there in the running as the most comfortable long-haul aircraft. IFE modern but only so-so in terms of choices. Music options were particularly obscure. Minor complaints were the two stops (Dubai and Brunei) dragging things out, especially the Brunei stopover where food, drink and shopping options remain limited. Staff did very few water or soft drink runs when the cabin lights were out. Also the three seven hour flights make food servings slightly difficult: one meal or two? Sometimes it was only one meal, which was a stretch (hungry), sometimes one plus a quite tasty and satisfactory hot wrap, but mostly one plus a serving of either sweet or savoury biscuits, which was enough to tide one over but rather odd.

### "didn't handle this well at all"
Bangkok to Melbourne via Bandar Seri Begawan, but we never actually flew with Royal Brunei, so I cannot comment on their inflight product. I can however review their handling of cancellations, delays etc. We arrived at BKK airport at 11am for our 1.30pm flight, only to be told that the Brunei to Melbourne sector was 'not operating' today, or the next day for that matter. Although Royal Brunei knew this the previous day, no e-mail or sms was sent to advise passengers of this. We could have stayed at our Bangkok hotel and opted for a late checkout if we had known. The Royal Brunei representative told us to 'take a seat' as they were 'organising' an alternative routing for us. This dragged on for well over an hour, and still they were 'organising' and 'waiting for confirmations'. I approached the counter and asked if we could avoid a late night departure if at all possible, given the fact that midnight departures and our 7 year-old daughter do not go well together. They replied: 'ok we will see. Just take a seat'. Eventually, we were told that we had all been booked on the direct Thai Airways flight to Melbourne, departing after midnight. There were no other options. According to Royal Brunei, Thai doesn't operate a morning flight from BKK to MEL, but 'if there was a morning flight, you could certainly have taken it'. Well of course there is a morning flight with Thai: TG 461, which operates daily. At that stage we had all been booked on TG 465, so we had to go with it. We transferred to an airport hotel around 2pm for 7 hours, and then back to the airport. It is how certain airlines handle unexpected issues such as cancellations, delays etc that set them apart from the truly good carriers. Sadly, Royal Brunei didn't handle this particularly well at all.

### "economical full service airline"
Travelled Singapore to Kota Kinabalu via BWN and Kota Kinabalu to Jakarta via BWN using frequent flyer points. Both flights had a stopover in Brunei. Whilst I regularly travel Business Class with Royal Brunei this was my first time travelling Economy Class with them. All flights were on time. As short haul flights there was no IFE of note. Meals were served on all flights, even the short distance from Brunei to Kota Kinabalu. Royal Brunei is a dry airline so there was no alcohol. Food was good and well served and the choices were available. Desk staff in Kota Kinabalu were very good and at short notice, after seeing how I was walking, arranged a wheelchair for me in Brunei and then Jakarta. In Brunei, I had a relatively long stopover and staff bought water and dinner for me (I had asked for some water and was given both). I will continue to fly Royal Brunei airlines - an economical full service airline.

### "not a premium service"
London to Brunei via Dubai with Royal Brunei Airlines. Cabin half empty, row 11 has no windows adjacent to seat which requires passengers sitting in 11A and 11K to lean forward to see outside the window. Despite half empty cabin one of the three main menu options were not available. As airline is a dry carrier, only basic fruit juices, fizzy drinks and hot beverages are served. Cabin crew polite and efficient but not a premium service. Complimentary goody bag is a joke when compared to most other carriers. Crew change in Dubai and next sector to Bandar seri Begawan only had four pax in the cabin. Both service and food on offer much better on this sector. Seat and flat bed comfortable. IFE choices are limited and seat configuration 2x2x2 is not ideal for long sectors. Toilets clean. The product difference between Royal Brunei and a premium carrier such as Qatar Airways is substantial. Paying the additional premium in order to get a much superior product and service delivery may well be justified.

### "the food was excellent"
We thought we would try Royal Brunei's Boeing 787 as opposed to our usual monthly trip to the UAE on the larger competitors on this route from London to Dubai. Check in was fast and efficient. Fast track immigration and security at LHR T4 and the use of the Etihad lounge was appreciated. The lounge was very quiet as very few other flights were using it. Boarding was fine - priority for business class. Nice seats together at the front of the aircraft as they operate two classes only. Plenty of room and space to stretch out - just as good as EY and EK offerings. We took off on time. Amazing for Heathrow. Service was good and the food was excellent and plentiful. Its a dry airline so we brought our own bottle of wine but be cautioned - they used to be happy to let you drink your own alcohol on board but this time it was permitted only reluctanly and provided we drank it out of plain paper cups so as not to upset other passengers. We were given comfy pillows and duvets to help a good night's sleep but you have to make your own bed. We landed early in Dubai, excellent stuff. Would we use Royal Brunei Airlines again? Maybe. The crew were not particularly friendly although very efficient snd the price is very competitive. They need to tighten up a little on the friendliness and general spproachibility of staff.

### "ticket costs represented value"
We were aware that Royal Brunei Airlines flights were alcohol free and this was a plus for us as we are both teetotallers. We found staff extremely helpful. Business class only had 16 seats which converted to flat beds. The toilet facilities were cleaned through the flight. The food was excellent and could be ordered to suit your timetable with 30 minutes notice. The stopover at Brunei and Dubai were for refueling and cleaning. Showers were available in the Business lounge at Brunei and this was appreciated. We would recommend this airline to other passengers. We thought the ticket costs represented value compared to the top flight airlines, bearing in mind that top airlines may be more fancy in business class.

### "very basic airline"
After trailing Royal Brunei Airlines on the Kangaroo route 5 years ago, it seems to have improved on the hard product, but there are still issues with service and inflight entertainment. Brunei airport (BWN) seems to have upgraded its cosmetic appeal, yet it is worse than ever. It's a basic airline with no small touches. The airline delivers its service and that's it. No hot towels and no menus while flying economy. It's a very basic airline. Crew keep to themselves and the constant stopovers become tiresome. The Boeing 787 is a wonderful aircraft, but more entertainment options are a must and hot towels would be nice. Still a basic 3 star airline, no more than that. A long way to go for this south east Asian airline competing in a huge market.

### "the best deal on the market"
I have found Royal Brunei to be a very comfortable airline to fly with, the food is of a good standard just as any other airline, yes no alcohol, but that is ok. Plenty of refreshments offered throughout the flight. Movies were good. Not much at Brunei departure lounge but hopefully will improve with upgrades going on. Most of all the price offered by Royal Brunei is truly the best deal on the market flying from New Zealand to London for $1630 return.

### "a straightforward airline"
My wife and I have just booked on Royal Brunei Airlines for the fourth time to visit family in Australia. It is a straightforward airline - no unnecessary frills but all of the needs attended to. No alcohol as Brunei is a devout Muslim country, but that doesn't bother us at all. Very friendly, helpful staff on board and at Brunei airport (there is time for us to nip outside for a smoke). The food is very good and plentiful, drinks come round regularly and on-board entertainment up to spec. The best bit is the price - booking in UK, off peak, is just over £700 return each.

### "staff friendly and helpful"
Royal Brunei Airlines on the Dreamliner from Melbourne to Heathrow with stops at Brunei and Dubai on Boeing 787. No real complaints only that the coke and sprite they served was flat. There was enough room for me as I am about 6'2 and about 115kgs. There's not much at Bandar seri Begawan Airport, but it is undergoing upgrades. Would recommend this airline for the price as it was only $3000 or so return for me and my wife. Staff were friendly and helpful.

### "enjoyed all aspects of the flight"
We flew Melbourne to London via Bandar seri Begawan and Dubai return, and can recommend Royal Brunei. We flew business and thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the flight and services. I believe they offer a value for money service and look forward to the opportunity to fly with them again.

### "Absolutely great"
Melbourne to Heathrow via Brunei and Dubai. Absolutely great. I was a little apprehensive when booking with what I considered to be an unknown entity. Check in staff were excellent, and having to ask they changed my seat position for my comfort, seeing I'm 6'4'. It the most comfortable seating I have experienced, and service from cabin crew was excellent, they never seem to stop delivering food or drinks and were incredibly helpful and polite. I consider that both inflight entertainment and food were of a good standard, equal to that of more expensive carriers. Overall I found the level of service excellent and terrific value for money. I would have no hesitation in flying Royal Brunei in the future.

### "Boeing 787 seat comfortable"
Good check in at Bangkok. I was late and they were patient while I organised my bags so that the main luggage could be checked through to Melbourne and I could have just a day pack for an extended transit in Brunei. The first flight was smooth and a good meal was served. It landed on time in Brunei. For the second flight I had to collect my boarding pass from check in - Royal Brunei had a dedicated check in and it was very quick. I then waited for the flight to Melbourne in their lounge (not one of their strongpoints). Melbourne flight arrived on time. Dinner was good although a little slow being served. Given the poor quality of their lounge eating dinner in the lounge is not really an option. Luggage quickly off the flight. The entertainment head sets were collected early on both sectors and the choice of entertainment a little limited. Seats on both flights were comfortable and the Boeing 787 flat bed seat is comfortable and I had a few hours of good sleep. They wake you relatively early on the descent. Food on both sectors was good with reasonable sized portions which were quite tasty. Drinks are non alcoholic which is a bit limiting but given the cost of the ticket well worth not drinking alcohol on the flight. There was no drink or food service once the plane started the descent.

### "great value for money"
My second time flying with Royal Brunei from Melbourne to London with stops in BWN and DXB. Still great value for money. The cabin crew pleasant except for the young male flight attendant on the Brunei to Melbourne leg who was so busy flirting with two young girls sitting next to me, he twice failed to ask me if I would like a drink! My vegetarian meals were the same type as last year and it was boring. Vegetarian meals don't have to be that boring some vegie lasagne, curry, sausages anything but the same old things over and over would be nice. Get a different catering company.

### "a nice way to fly"
I flew with Royal Brunei on their Boeing 787 in April/May this year to London from New Zealand. The seats no more comfortable than any other airline but the leg room was good. The food was very nice and no complaints there, the matter of no alcohol was not a problem. With the price from Royal Brunei, I think this airline makes it a nice way to fly to London.

### "cabin crew best I have encountered"
Melbourne to London via Bandar seri Begawan and Dubai with Royal Brunei Airlines. A modern Boeing 787 that appeared to be well maintained. I had read that the seats were uncomfortable but did not find them to be so. There is more room than most economy seats. The aircraft is quiet and smooth and larger windows can be darkened rather than having shades so amount of light coming in can be regulated. The cabin crew were the best I have encountered across many airlines. I was a bit nervous as Royal Brunei was the cheapest fare I could find.

### "service was genuine, unsophisticated"
We got a special price for Royal Brunei Airlines business class that was $3k below the nearest competitor, and $4k below Qantas. This is hard to go past but we were sceptical. Our experience was great - the Boeing 787 was very comfortable, beds were fully flat and doonas and pillows made it easy to sleep (10 hours across 3 flights to London). The trip is in 3 parts with a 1-2hr stopover in Brunei and Dubai, and makes it much easier in the old body - the service was genuine, unsophisticated and a refreshing change. Generally nothing was too much trouble - the entertainment system was adequate but take a book.

### "service was friendly and food excellent"
Melbourne to Bangkok via Bandar seri Begawan, MEL-BWN on Boeing 787 which was very comfortable and spacious, business class seat is flat bed style. The movie selection was a little limited. Food was excellent and good sized portions. Cabin crew were friendly and provided good service. Toilets were clean. There is no alcohol on the flight although I understand that if you bring you own you may drink it on this sector of your flight. Brunei to Bangkok was comfortable with spacious standard seats. Again, the entertainment was limited but a full meal was served. This was the more traditional Business Class but service was friendly and food excellent. My bags were among the first off in Bangkok.

### "a good experience but basic"
I booked my ticket last minute and as it was so cheap I did not expect much with Royal Brunei Airlines. The Boeing 787 is spacious, comfortable seating and  inflight entertainment system is good. However, the selection of movies and tv programmes is limited, but  only a 6 hour flight. The food was ok but better than some airlines. The staff were very friendly and professional. I kind of expected a snack before landing or at least a cup of coffee or even the opportunity to purchase one. Overall, a good experience but basic. Royal Brunei Airlines had a very relaxed and chilled atmosphere in the cabin.

### "will not be using this airline again"
Myself and my wife were flying home to England with Royal Brunei Airlines. We have previously flown on Emirates and Virgin to Dubai and they gave a much higher standard of service than Royal Brunei Airlines. On this trip, we were not given a choice of seats, the drinks came out of cartons and I had to ask for a cup of water 3 times before I received one. It was a night flight and not a very comfortable one. How people can fly to Australia on Royal Brunei Airlines is amazing, we will not be using this airline in the future.

### "seats were spacious"
This was a great flight, the seats were spacious and fairly comfortable. The food was very good with at least two choices. The two short stops made the long route much easier to bear and broke it up exactly at the right times. All flights on time, professional and friendly staff. Inflight entertainment was just right. Would highly recommend Royal Brunei Airlines and have flown with lots of different airlines in the past.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew with Royal Brunei from Melbourne to London in July/August. Found the staff to be excellent, very friendly and they go out of their way to ensure a comfortable flight. The price was excellent and the quality and service is defintely worth more then the fare paid. The aircraft's are brand new 787's. They are spacious and have excellent legroom, I'm 6'7 and was able to stretch out my legs under the seat in front of me with ease. The best legroom out of any of the major international airlines flying to Europe. Food was great. Good hearty meals and a decent portion size. Hot meals served on all 3 flights. Lots of snacks and drinks offered during the flight. It is a dry airline but being a part cultural thing, not having that glass of wine with my meal wasn't a huge deal, you can bring your own alcohol on board but no-one seemed to take advantage of this. In flight entertainment is good, not the best variety when compared to other majors but a good selection of movies and TV shows to get you through the flight there and back. I didn't notice a huge change in the movies from July to August apart from a couple new additions but this certainly wasn't a big issue. If you want more movies, bring your own laptop. Two stop overs on the journey to London, a 3 hour stop in Brunei which is not too bad. Airport has been renovated and it very comfortable, apart from having poor wifi and the refuel stop in Dubai is a very quick 45 min stop so a good way to stretch your legs ready for the next leg. Will fly them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I had a pleasant flight. I went from London to Melbourne in late Dec and came back mid Jan, they were the cheapest airline on offer, but by no means did it feel cheap. They were running brand new Dreamliner 787s the entire length of the journey. Seats are comfortable with plenty of leg room, I'm 5'7 or 170cm and I could easily stretch out with my legs under the seat in front. There is plenty of entertainment on board, USB chargers and you get pillows and blankets to sleep on. Staff are friendly and helpful and I ran into no problems at all during the flight. The food was nice, but bear in mind it will be Halal, I didn't have any of the meat, but the rest of it was nice. They brought around Oreos a few times to to snack on. There are the usual selection of soft drinks too, but no alcohol. Apparently you can take your own on board but I didn't see anyone drinking alcohol, so check with the airline first before you do so. If you are planning to go from England to Melbourne then you really can't go wrong by travelling with Royal Brunei. Just be aware that you will stop at Dubai for about 90 minutes to refuel and 3.5 hours in Brunei to change planes.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Mainly a comfortable trip. Seat comfortable, however controls difficult to work out. Food just okay. While respecting another country’s stance on alcohol, I think when one has paid a lot of money for the fare then some respect could be shown for cultural preferences ie wine with dinner. I found the one hour stopover in Dubai very annoying. Passengers must leave the plane, walk a long distance to the transit lounge, then go through security and then get back on the same plane again. bI was sound asleep when we arrived in Dubai and never settled again after this. Flight attendants were excellent but it’s a shame they couldn’t offer more ie better meals and wine. I flew with Qatar Airways business class 18 months ago and Royal Brunei Airlines does not compare with them,  although I acknowledge that Qatar Airways fares cost more.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
FAs address customers by name, very attentive service, meals tasty and plentiful and more food was available on request. Seats flat recline and pillows and duvets supplied. The IFE was not as expansive as other carriers but it is acceptable. Boeing 787 is noisier than the A380, but not the airlines fault. Would use again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
What can I say. Third trip to Dubai and have used Royal Brunei on all three occasions and have never been disappointed. Efficient, polite staff throughout, seats very comfortable and ample legroom. Flight crew were very polite and attentive, food was superb and drinks selection is great too Would not hesitate to use them again to Dubai or even longer. The first time we booked with Brunei was a bit apprehensive as were only £30 cheaper per ticket than Emirates but since then would always choose RB over Emirates for Dubai

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BKK via Bandar Seri Begawan. First leg was on the Dreamliner, clean and comfortable. It was noticably quieter than comparable aircraft. The food was surprisingly tasty and the service was second to none. I fly many airlines and often bemoan the drop in genuine service across the board, but particularly the Asian based carriers that were once unparalleled in this area. Often it results in the obligatory greeting and smile at the door but then everything becomes mechanical and any request is greeted with disdain. Not RBA (I can only judge on this sole journey). Call bells were promptly answered and the attitude was genuine. 2nd leg to BKK was on an A320, showing age, but nonetheless comfortable and ontime. Sky Lounge and BSB terminal in general are a little "tired" but the ongoing improvement works are obvious and everything was spotlessly clean. I have read a few negative comments on the Sky Lounge. All I can say is it was clean, food was standard airport lounge fare and the WIFI worked. IFE was only fair but ok and theres alcohol served onboard. Great value for money

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to Heathrow. We flew business class in the new Dreamliner and although a dedicated Boeing fan was disappointed in the noise level of this aircraft. I think Boeing has to look at better insulation as the Airbus 380 is far quieter! As far as I'm concerned Boeing hurried this aircraft through too quickly and didn't get some things right. I see in the reports that the seats are uncomfortable on long flights comfortable seats are a must. Otherwise flying Royal Brunei is good value and I don't mind stretching the legs in seven hours hops. Business lounges at both stopovers pretty ordinary!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew from MEL-CGK via BWN. They changed our flight timing from BWN to CGK to an unholy 2.00 arrival time in Jakarta. After consultation they gave us a hotel room and a free meal voucher for my family of 3. This made the 7 hour layover in Bandar Seri Begawan very pleasant. The 787 was a true delight. I enjoyed the inflight entertainment system Impian. It had a large number of videos and games to keep my child entertained. My wife enjoyed playing games too. On the A320 and the A319 they were starting to show their age. I hope they are upgraded shortly to 737 NG aircraft. The food on all sectors was excellent the only complaint would be the spicy chicken out of Jakarta more for Indonesian tastes. A new staff member on the CGK to BWN route on return was working really hard and learning the job. Price was excellent. Only slight grizzle was that the overnight BWN to MEL flight a few of the staff appeared grumpy and upon landing although primarily Australian and UK citizens decided that it was fun to discuss (in Malay) how tired they were and so on. We discussed this (attitude) with the head of the cabin crew who was lovely. She remembered us from a previous trip. Most staff were attentive and sincere. The seats are comfy and I am 6'6" in height and have no trouble and do not feel cramped at all. I look forward to my next trip on Royal Brunei.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Very impressed! We booked an economy return flight from London to Melbourne (via Dubai and BWN) for the Easter Break. We hadn't planned on going to Oz but after finding an amazing price with Royal Brunei we had to go! We had 6 flights In total and couldn't fault either of them. Flights were on time staff were very polite and couldn't do enough for you. The planes were clean. However the seats could have done with some more padding! I was in the window seat on row 50 (no windows) for two of the flights. Avoid these seats if you can as the side of the aircraft encroaches on your space and became uncomfortable. The food was varied for all of our flights but was tasty. The crew were very attentive and were giving out drinks throughout each of the flights. The wait at BWN Is a tad on the long side but that would be my only gripe. I will definitely fly Royal Brunei again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew Melbourne - Ho Chi Minh City return in Business first time in biz and must say it was worth every cent even though we managed to get a great deal. The new Dreamliner is a beautiful plane comfortable and quiet service was excellent as you were addressed by name and the food was divine and plenty of it. A couple of years ago we did Melbourne to Kota Kinabalu with this airline in economy and found them fine that is why when we seen the deal we couldn't resist. Check-in was a breeze at all points they use Cathay pacific lounge in Melbourne which is small but more than adequate . Staff are friendly and you are never left wanting we have already booked a trip with them in October to Bangkok we wouldn't hesitate recommending them in either business or economy but remember they serve no alcohol.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I recently flew return from Melbourne to Bangkok (plane change in Brunei) with RBA and had a great flight(s). My positive experience started before I booked my ticket when I emailed the Melbourne RBA office with some questions they were always prompt and helpful with their replies. I emailed them again after I booked to change seats and experienced the same excellent service via email. Flights between Melbourne and Brunei are on the Dreamliner which is so comfortable. Then it is a 1 or 2 hour stopover in Brunei. Flying in business class I expected to go through security quickly but for some reason there was a long queue and it took over 25 minutes to get through? I did not experience the same on the return flight it was empty and I walked straight through. I spent the entire time in the royal skies lounge as there is nothing to do in the airport. The food etc was good in the lounge the only problem I had was with their wifi - it was slow and kept dropping out. The flight from Brunei to Bangkok is in an A320 or 319. It is comfortable enough but can not compare to the dreamliner. Using the fast track pass from RBA I was through the airport and in my pre-arranged car in under 25 minutes. Leaving BKK I got a pass to the Air France lounge. A very nice lounge with good facilities and quality food. Service on board all flights was exceptional. Staff were very helpful and polite at all times. Regarding the no alcohol policy I didn't find this a problem at all and actually enjoyed the break from it on my return flight after drinking too much on my holiday. From MEL-BKK a couple next to me pulled out a bottle of wine and the staff were happy to serve it to them so no problems taking it on board. Just remember to leave any opened bottles on board and declare any unopened bottles when transiting through Brunei. Overall I really enjoyed flying with RBA and will definitely fly with them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne-Bangkok-Melbourne. Royal Brunei continue to provide an excellent value for money going to Bangkok. It is a dry airline and no alcohol is served. The Cabin Crew are friendly and look to provide a good service. I have yet to meet an unhelpful flight attendant! The flight from Australia left on time and I easily made the short connection time for the flight to Bangkok. Food on all sectors is good and presented well. The Dreamliner (B787) is an excellent aircraft - it is spacious and the beds are lie flat and quite comfortable. The A320 from Brunei to Bangkok is the traditional seat up Business Class but reasonably comfortable for a short haul journey. The return journey was ultimately cancelled because of technical problems the first suggestion of delay came when the first boarding call was about to be made. There were a couple of further delays and notice given of them. It was five o'clock when the flight was to be cancelled. Business Class passengers were accommodated in a five star hotel with dinner and breakfast provided. No lunch had been provided but we did have access to the Business Lounge. Cancellation of my flight meant that I missed a connecting flight on a separate ticket to Canberra and Royal Brunei arranged for me to catch the same flight (at no extra cost) on the next day. An option was given to fly economy class on a different carrier and arriving on the same day as planned but I declines this. For the Business Class passengers I was satisfied with the treatment and the hotel that was utilized we were kept reasonably well informed as to what was happening and what the options were. I will continue to use Royal Brunei to/from Bangkok.

Recently flew as family of 5 from London Heathrow to Melbourne stopping over in Dubai and Brunei. While the trip was value for money the flight staff polite and the food ok (although not very varied and drink selection poor) there are a number of drawbacks to flying with them and we would not fly with them again if had more money. The stop over in Brunei is a very long 3 hour wait and very limited airport facilities (our local train station has more). The most annoying thing is the lack of customer service from Royal Brunei subsequent to our trip. We have sent 2 online forms and to date have received no response. Hint: remember to take all goods with you or/and do not leave in seat pockets/chair seat or on the floor - the verbal announcement is unclear.

MEL-DXB return. Apart from the couple of hours stopover in Brunei between flight sectors the whole experience was excellent. The Business Class Lounge at Brunei International Airport was comfortable and provided very satisfactory food and facilities. The new 787 Dreamliner Business Class seat was very comfortable the food tasty and the staff most helpful. The inflight entertainment was adequate but not as extensive as many other airlines.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Excellent went from Heathrow to Melbourne in October and returned last week. The improvement in Brunei has made a big difference. I like the two stops it equals out the journey and it is good to stretch your legs. The Dreamliner was very comfortable and the staff could not have been more helpful I quite liked the meals and the lack of alcohol doesn't bother me. All in all a very pleasant journey I will certainly be flying Royal Brunei next time.

Flight from Melbourne to Brunei business class. Check-in was easy and fast the one dedicated counter was being used by a large group but one of the guys in economy told me to come to his counter before the line of people in economy. With RBA business you get a fast pass for immigration and security scanning which makes it much faster. RBA uses the Cathay Pacific lounge in Melbourne which is small but feels large the food coffee and drink selection is pretty good for a small lounge but the quality is very high. Onboard the plane the service was fast when I got onboard the flight crew was fast to come up to me with a drink (non-alcoholic as RBA is a dry airline) and welcome me by name. The RBA Boeing 787 is an amazing aircraft you really notice the larger windows and the way they tint is amazing. The business class seats on RBA are excellent fully recline large seat and a large touch screen TV. The only down fall of the flight was the main meal it was over cooked beef that was reheated like always on planes but the company who cooks it didn't look like they tested it very well in the air. Overall for the price I will always fly RBA when I can.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
The main problem flying economy class with Royal Brunei in my view is their Boeing Dreamliner aircraft I don't know who designed the seats in it's economy section but passenger comfort was clearly not a consideration. If you can sit on a park bench with your elbows pressed against your ribs for hours on end then this is the aircraft for you however I struggled. Leg room was actually not bad (I'm 6') but the seat width was very cramped with a reclining mechanism which just didn't work on my seat and others. A 2x4x2 seating configuration would have been far better than the 3x3x3 currently employed. Other in-flight irritations included toilets which could somehow display an 'engaged' red light when in fact they were empty leading to unnecessary queuing the inability to cut between aisles to visit an opposing toilet due to the tight seating layout and no seat hook to hang a jacket or jumper only an insecure communal locker somewhere forward. Overall an uncomfortable and tiring experience I want to forget.

MNL-BNW. My 1st time with this Airline another very pleasant surprise! Fantastic food and service. Unfortunately no on seat video although announced. Airbus A320 showing age to be replaced.

I travelled from Heathrow to Melbourne assisted travel stopping at Dubai and Brunei. on 9th Dec and back on 4th Jan. The plane was comfortable the service excellent the staff were helpful and always cheerful the food was good and legroom was better than other airlines. I was not looking forward to the journey on my own but I couldn't fault anything including the excellent assisted service.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BWN-BKK. Flights were on time and the cabin staff were professional and courteous. The aircraft were in good condition and the in flight entertainment system on the MEL-BWN leg was excellent (touch screens dozens of movies and games) but was less comprehensive on the BWN-BKK short haul. The food was atrocious on all legs. It was the worst I have encountered since the 1970s (soft rubbery vegetables meat that smelled "off" garish desserts ersatz "bread" all completely inedible). For this reason alone I am extremely unlikely to use this airline again. One final point: the seats were the hardest I have encountered in any airline.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We flew from Melbourne to Bangkok and back through Bandar Seri Begawan. The interior was plain and the seats were uncomfortable. The worst was the food and service. The service was slow and we were one of the last to be served every time and from Melbourne to Bandar Seri Begawan from Bangkok to Bandar Seri Begawan and from Bandar Seri Begawan to Melbourne there was only one meal option available by the time the food service got to us. This was not the meal we wanted and once the flight attendant said "try it" almost to say eat it or go hungry. Not to mention the food we received after all that was bland and tasteless. I fly around a lot and this was the worst airline and service I have ever experienced. The airline was cheap and nothing like their persona. I would not recommend this airline to any one a budget airline would be better.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
My experience of flying Melbourne to BSB and then to BKI has mixed feelings. Firstly the baggage limit of 20kg is small. The delay in providing headsets and collecting them 30 minutes before landing kills the joy of enjoying the inflight entertainment. The inflight entertainment is limited and they don't have much latest movies. Worse still  even after putting maximum volume the conversation in the movie is hardly audible. The horror came when the person sitting in front decided to lean back and the screen is non-adjustable. The meals were good. The transit left a lot to be desired. Only 2 security checks with long queues because flights depart around the same time. The BSB-BKI sector was very plain. Only a glass of juice - no peanuts or snacks.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew from LHR to MEL in early November. The stop over in Dubai and Bandar were fine and due to departure time broke up the flight nicely so that an evening departure would lead to a morning arrival. The Dreamliner was actually quite loud but was more like a white noise than anything intrusive. The 3x3x3 configuration is very good and most solo travellers did not have someone sitting next to them which is a plus for long haul comfort the load factor must have been around 66% for all legs of my flight. The air quality was excellent although the seats were not particularly comfortable. I did ask for blankets to make my own lumbar support and this help a lot. Despite this I felt more refreshed after 24+ hours travelling than I have done travelling only 3 hours in Europe. I am only 5'9" but I was able to stretch my legs out under the seat in front (without intruding on the person in front so this is a plus). The cabin crew were polite and non-intrusive (which is a good thing in my book since often I like to sleep without announcements etc) but they were also good fun - I had a chat with them in the galley and had a little Malay lesson. The food was hit and miss and probably had more to do with on the ground caterers in different counties. On the LHR to Dubai section the food was good. Dubai to Bandar it was very poor. Bandar to Melbourne was an excellent curry that was flavourful and not greasy. The price for a one way flight was excellent and around £200 cheaper than alternative airlines in that month.

Melbourne to Brunei 24 Nov BI054. Brunei to Dubai 24th Nov flight BI097. 4 December Dubai to Brunei BI058. 4th Dec Brunei to Melbourne BI053. This is a great airline to fly with new 787 Dreamliners. Staff were friendly and helpful food on board was great and plenty of it. I would fly with them again.

Flew Melbourne to London Return on their new Dreamliner plane. Flew Economy. Plenty of room and very comfortable. Excellent choice of movies etc. Food was good and service excellent. Two stops Brunei and Dubai. Brunei undergoing renovations and didn't seem like air conditioning working very warm inside terminal. Would definitely fly with them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Royal Brunei Airlines for the first time to fly to Australia in October. Check in was quick and easy. We left from Heathrow and stopped in Dubai and Brunei before going onto Melbourne. We did use all of the lounges provided but the one in Dubai was dirty and crowded. The service provided by the cabin staff was excellent respectful helpful and pleasant. The food was good quality but not so many vegetarian choices. The in flight movies were a bit dated but there were a good number of choices. It was a comfortable journey and I do like their Dreamliner plane. Once you learned how to roll the beds down it was easy to go to sleep. Overall their performance was excellent and I would certainly use them again and recommend their Business Class cabin.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Comfort and service good. Food below average. Beef not edible and ran out of the other options. They did offer to see whether they had any chicken spare in economy which makes you wonder whether their is a difference between economy and business. For the two stopovers had to stand in line with economy passengers. Business class service at Heathrow airport fantastic!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Business cabin in 787 comprises 18 seats in 3 rows. However 6 of the seats are compromised as 2 are designated window seats but do not have a window and 4 are in close proximity to the lavatories. The middle seats in the front row are worst as you definitely notice everyone passing you. Additionally there are no privacy screens and a lack of usable storage space other than overhead bins. Otherwise staff are excellent and the seats quite comfortable. Food and drink is more than adequate.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Just got back from Melbourne to Heathrow via Brunei and Dubai in my experience I cannot complain about anything I was very sceptical picking them but to save the amount of $$$ I did I will not hesitate to fly with them again. Brunei airport is "different" work is ongoing and has been for number of years I have heard. Nothing to really do there apart from a coffee and slice wifi was fine around the whole airport for me. Toilet area was ok. Dubai airport was ok only quick stop in same terminal. Inflight experience was fine good leg room. Seats comfy. Noise was low even in my seats right on the wing and engine. Staff were fine and friendly no issues there. Selection of films pretty low compared to others but still had enough to keep me going there and back. Food was fine.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I flew RBA for Melbourne - Kuala Lumpur route quite impressed with the business class. Not as good as emirates but worth the money. The only negative comments will be the 5 hours transit at Bandar Seri Begawan lounge which was driving me nuts as there was nothing much to do and I had to pay an extra MYR 1300 for excess luggage. You don't expect that with a business class fare. However B787 is an excellent aircraft and I will definitely fly RBA again provided I have a shorter transit time at Brunei. Last but not least its worth every penny!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Bangkok - Melbourne in Business Class. Fast and efficient check in in Bangkok the Express Lane saved a lot of time getting through Immigration and Security. Everything went well and was on time. Cabin attendants were attentive and the food and presentation up to my expectations for Business Class. Good meal and friendly service between Bangkok and Brunei (Cabin was full). From Brunei it was the new Dreamliner with its comfortable and a flat bed. Dinner was good and the movie selection was OK but not outstanding. At around half the cost of Thai or Qantas Business Class it represents exceptional value. Royal Brunei does not serve alcohol on the flights so have a drink in Melbourne or Bangkok before the flight. The will allow you to take a small bottle on board and drink it on the first sector. There was a problem with my luggage for some reason it was not given a priority label and as a result I had to wait quite some time for it in Melbourne.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to Dubai and return. My wife and I were very impressed with the high level of service we received on all four legs of our flights with RBA. We arrived at both parts of our journeys feeling refreshed. My wife who flies a lot noted with the Dreamliner flights that she did not suffer her usual ear/nose issues when descending. The feeling of space in the 787 was very welcome and we look forward to travelling with RBA again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I flew to Melbourne from Manila via Bandar Seri Begawan on 28th September 2014. The service from Manila to Bandar was very poor. The flight steward took 15 minutes at each row serving food - he informed each and every customer what food he was going to serve. He would spend a good 3-4 minutes serving each passenger. The process was so simple and yet they cannot systematically do it in a simple way. We were sitting on the 46th row and by the time they were able to serve us there was no selection of food and no option but to get what was left. This experience becomes more unbearable upon arriving at the airport - only one toilet each for male and female is in operation - the queue from the ladies toilet nearly reached the check-in station. Not enough signage or instructions and you see passengers walking around the airport like headless chickens looking for their departure gates. I consider Manila better than this airport.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Recently my wife and I flew Melbourne - London - Melbourne with RB and were absolutely satisfied with the experience. Having the opportunity to fly on the Dreamliner as well as the very attractive fares compared with Qantas / Emirates etc was a factor in my decision. Two x 7 hour and 1 x 9 hour legs was also a consideration despite the additional transit time. The food was excellent the staff very attentive and the 18 passenger cabin a calming environment. The lack of alcohol wasn't an issue. The movie selection wasn't brilliant but adequate. The Business Class lounge at Bandar Seri Begawan along with the whole of the terminal is undergoing an upgrade but what was available was appropriate and clearly better than being downstairs with the rest of the passengers. I'm looking forward to using them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to London via Bandar Seri Begawan and Dubai on 11th September and flew back on 19th September. The price was very good a minimum saving of $700 compared to what I would have paid on the other airlines. The chance to fly on the new Dreamliner was another attraction. And the final attraction was the chance to break up the journey into three 7 hour chunks rather than having two legs one of them 14 hours. I never enjoyed the 14 hour flights. Anyway I must say except for the cheaper price I wasn't completely satisfied with Royal Brunei. First of all the food was just average only two choices offered - chicken of beef. You also don't get a menu listing in advance to let you know what you are having. It was edible but nowhere near the quality offered on the bigger airlines. The quantity was also on the small side two gentlemen seated beside me were brave enough to ask for more. They don't serve alcohol but I don't drink so that didn't bother me. They had lots of soft drinks and juice though. The plastic cutlery was also made from poor material. The first time I had one spike from a fork missing the second time the whole fork was missing from the sealed cutlery package the third time the knife just broke when I was trying to use it to spread butter on the bread. Airport at Bandar Seri Begawan is also very substandard. I understand it was undergoing some construction but even then I expected clean toilets. The inquiry desk was mostly empty no TV screens and nowhere to buy food (on way back I noticed the shops could be somewhere upstairs but this wasn't clear). Also the wifi only works once you have checked in inside the check in gates. Outside in the general waiting area the wifi didn't work at all. Anyway I had something to read so that wasn't much of a worry. The choice of movies on their entertainment platform is very limited. There are about 5 to 7 movies under each category compared to several choices on other airlines. As a result I spent the journey listening to music on my iPhone once I had watched 3 or so movies. The seats are very hard and very uncomfortable. These were 7 hour flights so I could just manage. Worse I had a window seat so I couldn't keep asking the people beside me to make way for me so I could stand up instead and stretch my legs. Maybe it was just me or where I was sitting but I didn't find the Dreamliner any quieter than the A380 or B777. Still the same loud engine noise from outside. My own verdict is that for this price I would be happy to pay if the seats were comfortable. I could live with the limited food choice or the limited entertainment (just bring my own iPad) but the seating is so uncomfortable that I can't imagine another 26 hours to London on the same airline again. I certainly wouldn't recommend for those travelling with kids. The flight experience itself is part of the journey and I am not sure if the experience is enhanced on Royal Brunei. But if you are tight on budget buy your ticket early (I paid $1350 for mine) and maximise on the saving. If you buy later the saving won't be as much and at that price I don't think it will be worth it.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
My experience with Royal Brunei was excellent. My partner and I have flown on both their 777 service and now the new 787 service from London - Melbourne on September 10 2014. The 787 service is a huge improvement in passenger comfort. The seats are very comfortable and the leg room is the best I've experienced. The flight attendants gave us great service ample amounts of great food and regularly kept us refreshed with juices and water. The inflight entertainment was fantastic the price was the best I could find. The only downside would have been the lack of alcohol on the flight but we were able to bring a number of mini 50ml bottles and we used these discretely. The airport and Brunei is improving but still lacks any basic entertainment such as TV and I could not connect to the wifi. I'm sure these will be addressed soon. Overall rating is very good to excellent. I expect to be flying with them for the next few years.

Melbourne - through Brunei in Business Class. Everything went well and was on time. Cabin attendants were attentive and the food and presentation up to my expectations for Business Class. I liked the new Dreamliner and the flat beds. Movies were OK but not outstanding. There is a sense of space in the cabin. They don't serve alcohol but this is a minor factor. At around half the cost of Thai or Qantas it represents exceptional value.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I flew business class with Royal Brunei on 1st September from Melbourne to Bangkok. I chose to have a stopover in Brunei. I chose them purely on price I was expecting much. I can highly recommend them. I travel business class purely for the seat that is the most important aspect for me. Don't care about the service. I got a very comfortable lie flat seat from Melbourne to Brunei and a large comfortable seat for the short flight to Bangkok. The staff were excellent wonderful service. Food was good. Yes you don't get alcohol but that made for a pleasant flight. Highly recommend them. Brunei stopover was worth it. Brunei airport is small check in area brand sparkling new. All the toilets I checked out at Brunei were fine.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
The online booking system is pretty commonly used by other airlines as well so it's familiar. Unfortunately you don't have the ability to change/cancel your bookings online. Nonetheless email communications with the airline was swiftly attended to. I travelled on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner from MEL to BWN. The crew was friendly the movie selections were good the food was great. When compared to other planes I find the seats not very comfortable and miscellaneous storage space around your seat was inconveniently placed. Then I travelled on an Airbus A319 from BWN to MEL and I found that the old seats were much more comfortable even they don't recline to lie-flat beds. The BWN airport is undergoing renovations at the time of writing as such it understandably wasn't a pleasant experience at all.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I flew Melbourne to Manila return last month on RBA and was very satisfied with their overall service. Because the base airfare was already around $400 cheaper than Singapore Airlines and Philippine Airlines (who fly direct) I was not expecting a great deal. But from this experience I can say that aside from the no alcohol policy there was little to separate the flying experience between RBA and Singapore Airlines. The new B787 flying between MEL and BWN was presented in spotless condition the food onboard was very good and plentiful with very good customer service from the staff. Even on the shorter A320 flights between Brunei and Manila we were served a full meal similar to the longer Melbourne services. Probably the only downside to the experience is the small Airport at Brunei which was undergoing renovations at the time of my trip. Very little to see and do in the small terminal. No wifi TV to watch or even interesting activity on the airfield. Thankfully stopovers did not last much more than one hour or so. Like most modern economy class offerings the economy class seats on the 787 were not so comfortable and felt very hard. I have noticed this is also the case on new SQ A380s and CX 777s so it's not a unique fault of Royal Brunei. But besides these small faults I will be flying with RBA again the next time I return to Philippines and can say that as an overall experience they were well worth the money. The B787 service from Australia was much like that of Singapore Airlines' A380 for a fraction of the price.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
The in-air part of my experience of this airline was ok on the new 787 Dreamliner. The seats are hard and the in- flight entertainment is pretty limited Brunei Airport is pretty bad particularly the toilet facilities which were filthy. My only real complaint was to do with ground staff. I missed my return flight because while I was running later than planned I was at the check-in area where the desk should have been with time to spare according to their published cut off times (60 min before departure) but the check-in desk had already closed and there were no employees to be found (there wasn't even any RB signage - I had to ask another airlines staff if the desk with "this desk is closed" was the RB desk) so I was left a little stranded. After eventually finding some RB ground staff they were no real help and I ended up purchasing a ticket on another airline to get home. In future I'll stick with bigger carriers that have the willingness and capacity to deal with such occurrences.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
As far as the flight is concerned - that was great. Melbourne to London via Brunei and Dubai (though a very long trip). They use the new Dreamliner and it's true what they say the climate inside is much easier to handle and less noise too. Staff is very friendly and the no alcohol is no problem at all. The prayer before the flight is a little unnerving though. However - Brunei airport is a totally different ball game - the reason why I would not fly with them again actually. It's tiny to say the least and a building site - two toilets (hole in the ground only) and only one coffee shop. Seats in the waiting area are dirty (in fact the whole airport is dirty - especially the loos!). So no I won't be flying with them again - despite the price which is much cheaper than others.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew London - Dubai - Brunei - Melbourne and we were impressed with all 3 flights. Comfortable enough to sleep when we wanted to. Food was good although dinner out of Heathrow was very slow to be served. IFE choice was perhaps a little weak. Crew kept toilets spotless. Would definitely recommend particularly for the price paid.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew CGK-BWN-MEL on 27/7. CGK-BWN on the not so new Airbus A319 both seat pitch and seat width were good pretty generous for a "low cost full service airline. Had roasted chicken with honey on CGK-BWN which was decent. No IFE though. BWN-MEL was delayed for about an hour no compensation provided. Flew on the brand new dreamliner. Seating was quite good though the seat was not that wide due to 3-3-3 layout. Food was fine had a chicken linguine for dinner. IFE was smooth with many options. No booze on all legs which is a drawback. As far as i'm concerned service was good and it's worth the money I paid. Will definitely fly on RBA again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BWN and return on the 787 Dreamliner. Considering the cost of our flights we were really impressed. The plane was clean the IFE worked and the touch screens were very responsive and I found the cabin a bit more spacious than other planes. The staff were very friendly. On both trips the plane was half empty so we were able to spread out and have a set of 3 seats to ourselves. The bathrooms remained fairly clean during the flight although I wouldn't recommend sitting too close to the front as the bathroom smell permeates towards the first few rows of economy. One family were sitting in the window seats and left their lights throughout the overnight flight to Melbourne which were quite bright and shone towards the middle seats where we were seated. Both flights departed and arrived on time.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Just completed Melbourne to London return trip in business class on new 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Very comfortable 180 lie flat beds with duvet and pillow were excellent. Very attentive service food good in-flight entertainment was ok but not enough for long haul flight. Some technical issues with the plane caused delays both directions thought this is more a Boeing issue that RB. I'm 6'1" and found the seat/bed very comfortable and have no issue recommending Royal Brunei given they are usually $1-2k cheaper for business class fares than others.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to Brunei 10/7/2014. Brunei to Bangkok the same day. Returns on the 18/7/2014. Plane arrived on time on all 4 flights. The food on all 4 trips was either chicken or beef. The best way to describe it it was edible. The 787 flights have reasonable legroom if you are not too tall. Service was friendly even on the return flight when the plane was full.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-DXB-BWN-MEL 24/06/14 MEL-BWN-DWC-LHR 14/07/14. I chose RBA for two reasons only: 1) To try the Dreamliner - not sure about the windows and it's not much quieter than an Airbus 330/340/380 but the extra cabin pressure did seem to significantly reduce that drained feeling you get after a long flight. 2) A freakishly low sub £500 return to MEL. I wasn't expecting much but the most of the grumbles relate to temporary airport conditions: BWN very small and under refurbishment - facilities very limited (just a cafe upstairs a clean but run down toilet and a makeshift waiting area with unusable free wi-fi. Note - no duty free or alcohol at BWN and there never will be). Stairs and buses instead of jetways at DWC - but that's temporary (and I preferred the terminal to DXB). I found the three legged journey with short stops preferable to the usual two. Didn't appreciate being called 'immediately' to the transfer desk at BWN on the return only to be asked to swap seats with someone complaining about their 'with child' seat allocation. Other than that the food was very good (though they need to change that lamb dish) excellent legroom very good/excellent staff service. IFE was very good though not sure I'd want someone behind me constantly tapping the screen while playing Tetris - no handsets. Definitely felt like a significant step up after my last two flights with a US carrier and easily on a par with my LHR-AUH-SYD trip last year with Etihad. If others have the same experience as I did RBA's rating will surely rise to 4* very soon – even at £800+ RBA are still a good option on this route. Just don't forget that RBA/BWN are dry - so allow room in your carry on liquid bag for a couple of miniatures (or get duty free) if you like a tipple to settle you in to the flight - the staff don't mind as long as you are discrete.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Due to technical issues we are marooned in Dubai. Landed at 3.45 am C Concourse at gate C5 and shuffled around finally into a hotel on the A Concourse at 10.30 am with no advice as to likely updates. Last communication with any representative of Royal Brunei is now over 14 hours ago. They cannot be contacted either by phone or email in either Australia or Dubai. Apparently advice from hotel staff at 9 pm tonight as to the possibility of continuing our journey which would be nice. Circumstances surrounding 17 hour delay may just be one of those things but complete communication failure is not.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flight Melbourne to London in May was good on all counts. Return flight last week was hit with cancellation and delays. Then because our flight was combined with the next day's flight room was very scarce. We understood the Brunei airport accident causing the cancellation but found that no communication at all was passed on at Heathrow or by email - there were no Royal Brunei staff there. So the risk is that because this is a small airline any incidents will cause major disruptions to many flights as they all rely on tight scheduling. We were housed well at Heathrow Hilton overnight but having someone to speak to would have made all the difference.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
The return flight from London was on time and the service excellent. The flight to London in March was very poor. The flight from Brunei was late leaving because two flights were combined. The flight from Dubai was hours late but no explanation was given. In fact we were told that the flight had been cancelled. Scheduled to arrive at 6.40 am we arrived in London at 14.00 hours.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
My son and I have just returned from London flying with Royal Brunei. We were especially pleased with the service that we got. The aircraft was very new and the leg room was extra welcome (my son being over 6 foot). The service from cabin crew on the plane and at all checking in areas was excellent. The meals were good and we had a choice of what we could have. The long flight to London was broken by two stops one in Brunei and one in Dubai. These stops were not long so there was no hanging around for hours waiting for the next flight but long enough to walk around and have a good stretch. We originally booked the flight because of the price - it was $1000 less than other airlines at the time of booking but we will certainly fly with them again.

Flew from Melbourne to London and they were excellent. Lots of legroom in economy class and my vegetarian meals were quite nice. The cabin crew are a delight and nothing is too much trouble. Brunei airport is a bit drab which is a pity. The two stops (Brunei and Dubai) were good actually because after two legs of basically seven hours flying you need to stretch your legs a bit. I would recommend this airline to anyone. Why pay more money when you can get comfort and good service with Royal Brunei.

I recently flew MEL to LHR on the Boeing 787 and what a treat it was. I wasn't able to preselect my seat at the time I booked so I called their office in Melbourne the staff member there was great and arranged all my seat selections to and from London. At the airport I went to the online check-in desk and was promptly served by another lovely staff member she moved me to a row that was completely empty so I had three seats to myself all the way through. The stop at Brunei and Dubai was reasonable although Brunei airport is not somewhere you would want to spend too long in. Food on the flight was adequate and the IFE system ok but limited. The staff on the flight were very professional and went around with regular drink runs and checking on passengers. The flight home was very much the same. Will definitely fly them again especially given the savings on price compared to other carriers.

SIN-BWN in 2013. B787 was clean and ambience was great. The cabin crew were friendly. Being a Muslim I find the travel prayer was aired through the IFE did reduce my nervousness. IFE sufficient for the short flight. I don't recall what was served for the inflight meal but it was tasty. Toilets in B787 clean and modern. BWN-SIN flight back to Singapore was nearly full so security check arduously slow as the queue was long. Flight back also on B787. Cabin crew was helpful and we were greeted with smiles. Overall my flights with RBA were satisfying and I hope they keep improving and be able to compete with major airlines.

A superb all-round experience - cannot fault! Flying Heathrow to Melbourne return each leg of both journeys on time. Food very good refreshments varied and plentiful. All staff very attentive courteous and exceptionally polite. We were fortunate enough to fly in the new dream-liner spacious aircraft with ample leg-room (we actually requested to be seated at the very rear of the aircraft where there is additional leg room) and surprisingly quiet. Fantastic value for money - no need to fly business class as economy service second to none. Will definitely fly Royal Brunei again!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I recently flew Melbourne to Heathrow with Brunei. I found the airline although quite basic extremely good value for money. The most impressive part of their service was their customer relations. After arriving in the UK and on my way to my family home I realised I had lost my wedding ring and knew that it must be on the plane. I headed back to the airport but unfortunately there were no representatives to talk to. A very kind lady behind the Brunei desk helped me to call the London office and talk to someone who would help. I was in a very stressed state and all the Brunei staff I talked to were extremely helpful and willing to do everything possible to retrieve my ring. Within a few hours the staff had managed to find my ring and kept it safe until I was able to get it back. Throughout the whole trip I found all staff ground and air to be extremely approachable friendly and helpful.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
My return trip on the Dreamliner in Business Class was surprisingly satisfying. Whilst the ergonomics of and seat controls takes some getting use to I like the bright and airy feel and the tinted windows. Further I was impressed with the quality and standard of service of the inflight crew. Indeed a "Better Fly". My only gripe is the departure time from Brunei to Melbourne doesn't allow one much sleep.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew from London to Melbourne stopping in Dubai and Brunei. Flew a two-week old 787 Dreamliner and it was spotless clean and felt very safe. Cabin crew were superb and incredibly service-minded and friendly. Seemed like a very professional airline. Since I am a bit nervous about flying I had a chat with one of the FA's on my way back to London (on the Melbourne-Brunei flight) and he was very friendly and calmed me down. Food was as good as you can expect from an airline entertainment system was a bit disappointing and a tiny minus for being an alcohol-free airline. The two stops were good to stretch your legs and get some fresh air even though Brunei airport is quite depressing (but that's not Royal Brunei's fault of course). But all the important things like service safety and comfort were top notch and I would definitely fly Royal Brunei again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I cheated on Qantas. Our relationship lasted over 20 years but now I have found Royal Brunei. For our first trip Melbourne to London we chose RB as it was $600 cheaper for the two of us. We were very impressed. Make sure you get the new 787 Dreamliner with lots of leg room a roomy feeling in the cabin and a usb port in the seat back screen to power my iPad. (Does not charge the iPad but uses the planes power). The crew were very helpful and brought soft drinks and juices around constantly. I think they try to make up for being a dry airline. We bought a small bottle of alcohol in Melb and the crew were happy to give us coke and ice. If you are desperate just buy a couple of the small airline bottles and put them in your liguids bag in your carry on. The three hour layover in Brunei was a bit of a pain as the airport is reduced to a small waiting area with only a coffee shop but the time flew by. Would highly recommend RB for anyone travelling MEL to London. This route is four star.

MNL-BSB-MNL 17-20 April 2014. The good: on-time flights attentive in-flight service meal even on such a short flight. The not-so-good: their airplanes at least from Manila are really looking old and in need of refurbishing. The cabin of the A320 they used looked tired and in bad shape. On the flight over the head-rest of the seat flew off when we were trying to adjust it. On the flight back the recliner did not work and the seat was always in the reclined position. Plus the space between seats even in the emergency exit row is tiny I'm not sure if it complies with international standards. When they finish renovating the BSB airport (the new part is looking lovely by the way) they should then invest on their planes a bit. But service is courteous and efficient.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Bandar Seri Begawan to MEL. Newish Boeing 787 which is supposed to be a lot quieter than other planes but it didn't seem much different if at all. Selection of entertainment somewhat limited but adequate for a 6 hour night flight. Fully flat beds which compare to the likes of Emirates. Cabin crew and lounge staff in BSB seemed reluctant to address the issue of noisy children.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew on Dreamliner Melbourne to Brunei. Flight departed late due to airport only using one runway. Spent 90 mins on tarmac waiting to take off. Biz class cabin has only 3 rows. Seat was comfortable enough and the provision of a large pillow was great for sleeping. Service was excellent food was equal to other airlines and IFE adequate for all but avid movie buffs. Missed my connection in Brunei due to delay in Melb. Was met on arrival guided through immigration and sent to hotel for overnight stay. Flight to KL the next day was equally as good.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew from Melbourne to Heathrow and back in March and April. The service was excellent the food tasty and appetizing particularly the Asian options. The IFE was comparable to any four star airlines with the latest films available. The real bonus was flying in the B787 Dreamliner which was operating all the way from London Heathrow to Melbourne and from Brunei to London. The service on the B777 was also good. The staff were on the move providing water and fruit drinks to pax all night long. The price of the ticket was economical and well worth the money comparable to other airlines operating between Melbourne and London. I will fly them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Tired planes but the Dreamliners are now here. Enjoyed my trip to Bandar Seri Begawan and can't wait to fly Royal Brunei again soon!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew economy class Melbourne to Brunei on B777 then Brunei to London via Dubai on B787 26-27 Mar. Was dubious about the initial leg on the older B777 following reviews on here but was very pleasantly surprised. Aircraft was clean with plenty of legroom - I am 195cm tall. Cabin crew were superb and meals were excellent surpassing the standard of many 4 star airlines I have flown with. Drinks were freely available and nothing was too much trouble for the crew. Comfortable flights seats perhaps a little firmer than some. In flight entertainment was good and sufficient for the 3 legs though not as comprehensive as some carriers. Flights were around $300 cheaper than the next competitor. Excellent value and a fantastic experience - looking forward to the return journey and would wholeheartedly recommend Royal Brunei to anyone.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Bangkok to Melbourne via Brunei. All flights took off a few minutes early and also landed a few minutes early. Given an IPAD for entertainment between Bangkok and Brunei and flight was in an older Airbus 319. Seat was comfortable and service was very good - attentive cabin staff. Had a few hours layover in Brunei and then to Melbourne on older B777. Flight was punctual and the food good. Drinks freely available and plane very lightly loaded - only five in Business Class. Was a bit disappointed that the new 787 was not in operation as seat not so comfortable as a bed. Film selection was a bit limited. Royal Brunei is a comfortable three star airline without pretensions but Royal Brunei offers excellent value for money in Business Class which is why I continue to fly with them on a regular basis.

24 Jan Shanghai BI 614 to Bandar Seri Begawan. Bandar Seri Begawan BI 737 to Jakarta Intl. Return 21 Feb BI 738 and BI 613. Price was good food was ok. Delayed about 2 hours we all waited inside the plane that was just moving around like an airport sight seeing tour. My return flight was canceled on Monday and they re-timed my ticket to Friday. Flight delayed 5 days and they gave nothing for it. You get what you paid for.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
A very quick last minute trip had to happen from Melbourne to UK. They are fantastic and their flight attendants are the best I've experienced. Their planes are spotlessly clean. You were not swamped with attention perfect for me. No alcohol no problem two stops not great I prefer one. Brunei airport awful but is being upgraded to be finished this year. Vegetarian food terrible but so is every other airline. Overall I would recommend them. I travel to UK at least twice a year at the moment for family reasons and have travelled with most of the major airlines they should look at Royal Brunei and see a winning formula.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
My husband and I travelled from LHR-Brunei-Melbourne to fly home for Christmas. Having read some good reviews of the airline and not having a stack of cash to spend on the flights we decided to give it a go. Firstly the online check in option was very convenient and easy to use. The only gripe here is that when we got to the airport we still had to wait in a massive queue to check our luggage in. However the check in staff were friendly and moved us through as fast as possible. On the London-Dubai-Brunei leg we had the new Dreamliner aircraft and it really did feel like a dream. We were delighted to find that we had plenty of leg room (we are both 6 foot and over so this is a big deal) and loved the open airy feel of the cabin as well as the smooth take off and landing. I am surprised that people have complained that they didn't know about the Dubai stop it is on itineraries and tickets and when you check in online. The variety of entertainment on board was quite adequate and the meals were really nice. The cabin crew on all sectors were friendly and obliging. On the way to Australia all our flights left on time and we even landed slightly early in Melbourne. Coming back we were delayed leaving Dubai but this was not due to the airline it was because a passenger did not show up for the flight. Having the two stops was actually really good as it allows you to get off the plane and stretch your legs really breaks up the journey nicely. All in all Royal Brunei exceeded my expectations for the price you expect really basic service and not much else but we found the whole experience really satisfying. Would happily fly Royal Brunei again to Melbourne and recommend them to anyone who wants to have a pleasant flight and not have to pay a fortune like some other airlines charge.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
My wife and I have recently return from a trip to Melbourne flying Royal Brunei (RB) in business class this has now spoilt us for any future trips to our relatives in Oz. It is more costly but we think at our age 66 hanging in the air for 22+hrs sat in economy is a real off-putter and justifies the additional cost. We cannot praise RB enough flights were on time the cabin crew very professional and attentive food was excellent aircraft cabin clean and well presented. First leg was on the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner business class cabin was superb spacious and very comfortable; lay-flat beds and noticeably quieter than the usual aircraft types. Second leg was on an older Boeing 777 once again very comfortable no complaints. Would we fly RB again yes defiantly we would highly recommend them to any one flying to Melbourne and thinking of business class travel.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BKK. Flights left and landed on time. Seat was comfortable and angled flat still got some hours of reasonable sleep between Melbourne and Bangkok. Food choice a little limited but portion size and taste was very good. Film selection not very good. Luggage did not get priority coming off the line in Bangkok - this seems a common complaint where airlines go through B to get to C. Staff very attentive and pleasant. Business class remains excellent value for money which is why I continue to fly them.

14/11/13 BI 098. 15/11/13 BI053. 22/11/14 BI054 BI097. Just wanted to say how impressed I was with RB I have just returned from Melbourne the first part of journey was on an older plane but from Brunei it was their new Dreamliner 787 and the aircraft is lovely great entertainment system I watched 3 films during journey! The service was really good and the food. I flew with Singapore Airlines last year and would say that RB are just as good and were £300 cheaper! I will definitely fly with them again and just hope the fares stay low!

I started using RBA in 2012 and will continue to do so. Having flown Melbourne to Bangkok 3 times in the last 18 months I am very impressed. Having used Business Class with 2 other airlines RBA wins hands down for serviceability and price.

LHR-MEL via Dubai and Brunei. Flew on the new Dreamliner (787) and from Brunei to Melbourne on 777. All flights on time the new Dreamliner aircraft is a joy to fly on food was lovely IFE faultless and crew friendly. The 777 is showing its age but all in all excellent value for money will use royal brunei airlines again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
London to Brunei. A dry flight so no alcohol on board however you can take your own onboard to drink but when disembarking in Brunei it will be taken off you. I couldn't fault the service this was no difference to other airlines I had flown in business. The food was somewhat basic but still of good quality. The aircraft is an ex SIA 777 so the layout was old 3 rows of 2 seats the seat transforms into a comfortable bed duvets supplied. Brunei to Manila served 3 course meal which was better than the ones I had on the previous flight from London to Brunei. Business class seats on A320 which reclined to a very comfortable position. I could not fault the staff and service.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
This was our second trip with Royal Brunei - first Melbourne to Bangkok return and now Melbourne to London to LHR return. In all eight flights in past 18 months. It is hard to find fault. While 777's are a tad ageing - with occasional minor seat maintenance needed - overall our experience has been excellent. Cabin service has been attentive and responsive use of our names always appreciated. Meals offer good choice and quality high. Entertainment offering is more limited than other airlines but it appears that their new 787's will have a wider range. Non-service of alcohol is not an issue. Business passengers have access to Etihad Lounge at Heathrow which is excellent although shared lounge in Dubai is not of same standard. If doing the full journey try to break at Brunei - plenty to do over three or four days and good accommodation offering.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Just back from a trip to England. I used Royal Brunei Melbourne to Heathrow return economy. It was an excellent service from beginning to end I had two stops which was good. I will defiantly travel with them again such good value. Food was good and all the staff were caring and helpful.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I flew with Royal Brunei because the were offering an unbelievably cheap return to Melbourne from Heathrow at the time I wanted to fly. For approx £750. I knew what I was expecting so wasn't upset that there was no onboard alcohol sales. Relatively comfortable with a good selection of IFE although the unit I had on the leg from Brunei to Melbourne was faulty and required multiple restarts to get it working. The food was surprisingly nice but the drinks service was a little lax and frugal my request for a drink took 30 minutes before receiving the same amount again. The frequent stops helped break up the flight and were a welcome hiatus from the cabin where the air could get quite stale. Overall I'd recommend and fly again with Royal Brunei especially if I'm on a budget but would consider spending extra if it meant getting that bit extra that comes as standard with other airlines that fly this route.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We flew business from Melbourne to Bangkok via Brunei within the last month. Decided to fly business as the price was better than others on the same route. In perspective it offered good service for the money. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Melbourne is adequate and comfortable. On boarding you are offered a drink (non-alcoholic of course) and hot (very hot) towel. Shortly after take off you are given a menu to mark what you want and then offered a series of magazines etc. The entertainment system worked fine the selection adequate. Meals were huge you could have five courses then snacks also if you wished. The service was excellent going with less in the cabin (business) but coming back it was full and the two people serving were struggling. I asked for a duvet instead of a meal coming back and I was eventually given that when the meal service was complete which was not my aim (I wanted to sleep through service). Anyway it was fine really the price was right and it was a comfortable easy flight. The staff are very nice Brunei airport is small but functional. Arriving our bags were first off which was very nice and on arriving back in Melbourne were given a fast pass but that didn't matter as the plane was the first international that landed.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL to Heathrow return business class. I chose Royal Brunei based mainly on price but also friends experience but was still apprehensive. They proved to be a very good choice and certainly equal on balance to most full service airlines. From a service point of view I did not have one bad leg and the staff were very attentive - at least equal to Cathay and Qantas and better than the European carriers. The food on all legs was good. I had a special meal order and on each leg a crew member discussed it with me just after take-off. The 777s are about 12 years old but are in very good condition. The seats whilst starting to show their age are inclined flat beds and if you can't get comfortable and sleep well particularly with the big pillows and doona then you may just too picky. The IFE isn't the latest but does a reasonable job. I took and iPad with my own selections and the seats accept a standard power connector so no need to by special attachments. They use the Cathay business lounge in Melbourne a shared business lounge in Dubai and the excellent Etihad one in Heathrow. I've flown business class with most of the major carriers and will have no hesitation using RB again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
You get what you pay for. That's basically it for RBA. I chose RBA for my journey from MEL-LHR for price and punctuality. I was not disappointed in that aspect. Had a close call during the stopover in Brunei but we made it in scheduled time to our destination LHR. The planes are old. My estimation around 15 year old planes. Entertainment unit was a gamble. The row I was on did not have a working entertainment unit from Brunei to Dubai. Several restarts did not help which to me was just a delay tactic by the cabin crew. As we boarded the plane in Dubai the new cabin crew was informed and we were moved to different seats with working units. Cabin crew overall was average as we weren't attended to a couple of times probably due to the small indicator LEDs. Food was good on the 1st flight from MEL-BRU but went downhill after that. Brunei airport is depressing. No delays on the return flight. Will I fly with them again? Only if the price difference with other airlines are considerable. This time it was around $2k for 2 person.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
On time flight on both directions from Melbourne to Heathrow. From Melbourne I took on board a half bottle of red wine purchased after customs and that was no problem at all. After always travelling cattle in the past the fare which I bought on sale several months earlier for only $4000 return was a bargain. Nice to be served meals on china and linen. When it came time to sleep on the last 6 hour leg into London I had no problem tucking in to the duvet with the almost totally flat 'bed' with a nice soft pillow. The whole experience both directions was impressive however the plane is getting old and an adjacent Business class seat gave up under a very rotund person. What amounted to a 5 course meal out of London was simply wonderful and when I couldn't decide on which dessert to have I asked for and was given both. The new Dreamliners will be in operation by the time my next holiday to the UK comes around and I'll have no hesitation whatsoever in re-booking to travel Business Class to London on Royal Brunei.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
My Husband and I travelled from Melbourne to Hong Kong with a stop over in Brunei. The staff on the 7ish hour flight from Melbourne to Brunei were lovely. They constantly came around with drinks and were happy to hand out blankets and pillows. Plus they handed out peanuts. The only problem was that the headphones they supplied wouldn't go into the plugs in the armrest but I used my own with no problems. The flight was great one of the best I have been on. Entertainment is a little limited if you compare it to someone like Emirates but it is a cheaper airline. Provided good movie choices some TV and music and some games. Flights from Brunei to Hong Kong and back again were on smaller older planes. They still served a full meal despite it being a much shorter flight and the entertainment was drop down overhead TV's. I don't have a problem with this on the shorter flights and usually take my own entertainment anyway. On the return flight to Melbourne it was an overnight flight. Blankets weren't provided but handed out when people asked. They were also around quite frequently with drinks and I had no complaints on the food either. I am vegetarian and am a little hard to please but I was quite pleased. No problems with the toilets on board. Clean whenever I went and I couldn't smell them at any time. Only complaint was of course the bathroom facilities in the Royal Brunei terminal in Brunei. Terrible! My suggestion would be to use the ones in the shower rooms as they were a bit cleaner. Would fly with Royal Brunei again no problems!

We flew RBA for first time and found the whole experience was very impressive. We flew Melbourne to London and returned a month later. The flights were on time staff friendly  food good although only criticism was that on LHR to Brunei some dishes on menu weren't available. Didn't worry about no alcohol plenty of other beverages available. Some passengers had their own wine with them which didn't appear to be a problem at all. The seats although not completely flat were much better than I expected and managed to sleep well. The two stops were great as it gave you a break able to walk around. Brunei airport is being revamped will be really nice when complete. We would certainly fly this airline again.

London Heathrow to Dubai - Economy return. The plane was full to bursting we found out that the flight was flying to Brunei with a stop over at Dubai there was no mention of this when booking. The plane looked very old shabby and stained. The entertainment system was very dated. The seats were small and the leg room minimal. In fact a very uncomfortable cramped journey there and back. The food was ok. The crew were the best however and did a very professional job in the circumstances they had to work in. They were very attentive and the beverages kept coming which was a nice change. There was a nearly 2 hour delay on the return flight with no explanation. I would not recommend this airline and I will not be travelling with them again.

Very disappointed we were flying back from Dubai to London on 27th August 2013 and on checking in they told us the flight would be delayed 7hrs. Having a small child with me they did not offer any accommodation the only thing they were able to give us was food voucher for McDonalds. I will recommend.

Melbourne to Heathrow Aug 2013. The flight attendants were very friendly and obliging the flight is broken into 3 legs with a 3 hour stop over at Brunei where you change planes and a one hour stop at Dubai. In the 24 hour flight you only receive 3 meals and drinks are provided throughout the flight the seats are the most uncomfortable seats I have sat in on any plane I have ever been in. I found the seating so uncomfortable that I could not sleep for more than 30 minutes at a time. The Boeing 777-200 is an old plane and should have been taken out of service 5 years ago to their credit the flights were on time both to and from Heathrow-Melbourne.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Bangkok - Brunei - Melbourne. Both flights lefts and landed on time. Royal Brunei is a dry airline and no alcohol was served. The food was quite tasty and the portions very adequate. The short flight from Bangkok had older style Business seats and the cabin was almost full. The inflight entertainment was OK and the staff were very friendly and helpful. From Brunei to Melbourne the cabin was lightly loaded and the staff service was very good. The cabin and toilets were clean and comfortable. The entertainment was good although the screens are a little on the small size and the technology a little old. The plane landed early and I discovered after clearing Immigration and Quarantine that I had left my glasses on the flight. I met cabin staff outside the restricted area and they told me that the glasses had been found and how to get them back. I fly with Royal Brunei once to twice a year to Bangkok and then return. The staff have always provided good service the entertainment has been adequate and the food enjoyable. I find the value for money to be exceptionally good and that is why I continue to fly them.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to London Heathrow return in economy class. All flights on time and enjoyed the 2 stopover legs as this is much better. I will agree with other passengers comments that the 777-200 Aircraft on these routes (on lease from Singapore Airlines) are showing their age a little and the IFE system being a very early version but still worked perfectly fine for all my flights and the movies entertainment all up to date. RBA staff for me were what made this trip so enjoyable nothing was too much bother food was good and well-presented and always a decent variety. Staff always friendly and doing drink and water runs throughout all flights. RBA are wonderful little airline they are not charging anywhere near their competitors on this route. I will most definitely fly with them again and I will also enjoy the lower based fares and excellent service on board.

Melbourne - Bangkok. Cabin staff helpful and friendly despite a near full cabin. Food was good but no alcohol (airline is Muslim and no alcohol is served). Seats comfortable although they do not fully recline. Non alcoholic drinks and snacks available on demand. Connection in Brunei was OK. Have been flying RBA for about three years and they represent excellent value for money in Business Class.

MEL to Brunei. Flight delayed and the whole trip and experience was horrible. There was no warning of a delay. Staff were unapologetic. The plane itself was old an uncomfortable flight. I suggest you avoid this airline.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We flew to London and return with RBA. Will not use this airline again. Service was non-existent. It is well known that when travelling long distances one should remain hydrated. So many times I had to ring for service and ask for water the plane was dirty - especially the fluorescent lighting that are on the wall of the plane were on both sides lined with cobwebs and dead flies - not a good look. Seats would not recline and entertainment system faulty. Certainly we get what we pay for and as such I will pay extra to ensure I have a better chance of enjoying long distance flights overseas.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I flew from MEL to LHR via Brunei and Dubai. I found Royal Brunei to be a very helpful and a good airline. I think the Boeing 777 needs upgrading the seats are a little uncomfortable. However I must say the cabin crew are very welcoming and warm in their dealings with passengers. Would fly again.

We had a lovely surprise holiday from Australia to London flying Royal Brunei and all I can say it was a memory we will never forget. From start to finish we were treated like royalty. Nothing was never to much the service food beds flight and people were lovely. We have always flown economy and never experienced 1st class. We will never fly economy again spend the extra and get what your deserve luxury.

I flew out on August 14 from Melbourne - London and back from August 2. While the cabin crew were very friendly attentive and courteous this is where the positives ended. Our flight was 5 hours delayed leaving Melbourne. Ground crew kept telling us we would know what was happening in 15 minutes. Due to the delay and withheld information many people were going to be unable to meet connections with other flights/services at their destinations. Flight to the UK was arduous in order to ensure we got to London close to our original arrival time our stop overs were just long enough to process passengers and refuel. Treated like cattle by ground crews in both Brunei and Dubai. Seats were uncomfortable my entertainment unit didn't work and the bathrooms were not the cleanest. Not enough blankets for everyone on the plane. I ordered the gluten/lactose free vegetarian meal I got various versions of ratatouille and no protein at all. On the way back I changed my preference to lacto-ovo which wasn't much better. Flight back was slightly more comfortable but my entertainment unit again did not work and the loos were not kept clean. I do not think this airline is suited to long haul flights at all.

Flew KUL-BWN and return. Both flights left early due to Ramadan. The outbound flight was 100% full in economy and empty in Business. The crew were friendly and a hot meal was distributed to everyone who wanted one and for those who were fasting a meal box was given to be eaten after sunset. On the return the plane only had 29 passengers on board yet the crew continued their high standards and the flight was very enjoyable.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
First they missed an issue with a re-entry visa at Melbourne which created havoc at Heathrow on the way out of the UK. Not a very good start. 50+ hours Heathrow to Melbourne. Left late rushed through Dubai only to sit in Brunei for 7+ hours with almost no information or explanation. They knew at 2pm the flight wouldn't leave till 10pm but kept making out it changed each hour. Missed connecting flights which didn't register with RB staff. Watch the food availability out of London only 4 meal options from menu were loaded and the front row got them all. Seats are hard and difficult to operate but once you master them they are OK. Food in average at best and the cabin crew and flight crew seem to don larger boots and practice route marching once everyone tries to sleep. For the money probably about what we deserved they just give the impression that what they offer is of a far better that what is delivered.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to Bangkok not good at all had delay for 3 hours without any reason they just postpone the flight every 15mins without any explanation. It's not an international airline it may be suitable for domestic flight inside Brunei.

Dubai to Melbourne last month. Flight was terrible. For a start the plane was freezing and when I asked for an extra blanket they told me there were no spare ones despite the plane not being full. My seat would not recline the entertainment selection was very poor and the food was awful. My duty free alcohol was taken off me even though it had been sealed from Dubai. We queued for about 45 minutes to get back on the plane after a 2 hour stop over and then had to wait for another hour once we had boarded the flight!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Of all my recent experiences flying LHR-MEL I would consider Royal Brunei to be the best. The cabin crew were genuine and attentive and being there for passengers was their primary focus throughout the flight. A big selling point was the additional seat pitch giving a sense of space and comfort. The recline was good. The entertainment system worked perfectly well. Meals were of similar quality to other carriers however were a little more generous than the offerings of some others and a lot more generous than those offered by BA and VS. Check in was simple and efficient in both directions and travelling through Brunei Airport was a joy. Small quiet no ridiculous long distances to navigate and not daunting in any way. I also prefer having two stops (3 x 7hr legs) between the UK and Australia as being in the air for 14 hours on the now standard 1x7 + 1x14 hour leg is nothing short of horrific. I would choose Royal Brunei on this route over all others.

First flight on 2nd June MEL-Brunei and fly home on 6th July. Found the airline to be good value for $. Bought a sale fare ticket and for the price was very happy with the service. Check-in was ok as had a problem getting our bags tagged through to Istanbul (final destination). This led to our luggage not turning up until 3 days after we arrived. Disappointing and annoying. Staff and crew were great seats very comfortable and able to sleep. Food and service was good not the standard of Emirates or Etihad long haul but also not the price tag either. Would recommend and also would fly with them again.

Melbourne-Brunei-Dubai-Brunei in the last week and due to fly on to Melbourne tonight. To some extent I guess your view of Business Class on this airline will in part be colour by how experienced a Business Class traveller you are. Passengers who usually fly economy can afford an upgrade as evidenced by one fellow passenger who slept across the centre arm-rest of 2 business class seats because he didn't know they reclined into an (almost) flat- bed! Good things: fares are fantastic business lounges food is reasonable entertainment is not state-of-the-art but perfectly evident and despite being an early version of business class you do get sleeper seats. Not-so-good things: service is variable (some of the cabin crew are world-class some are not) on my flight two of the seats were broken and wouldn't recline ex Singapore Airlines aircraft are looking tired. Overall? Normal business fares on this route were 40% less than the equivalent Etihad fare and I picked up a seat sale fare which was only one third. You can't beat that and Royal Brunei must always be considered but they an Etihad or Air New Zealand they are not.

My wife and I traveled in January from MEL-LHR. Sometime into the air the video systems were inoperable and they kept us waiting and then an announcement they had technical problems and it was several hours after that the system started to function. Tried to press the recliner buttons they did not work. Sat upright all the way through. After repeated complaints to the cabin crew senior steward we were explained that they had leased the aircraft from Singapore Airlines as they were waiting for ordered planes to be delivered later in the year. Experienced same problems on our return flight. Food service was basic nothing spectacular. Toilets were wet and dirty at most times and tissue papers had run out and not replaced. Staff were untrained and most could not oblige maybe because they could not understand the English language well. Unfortunately we are booked to travel again later this year as it was booked soon after the initial booking. Yes as the saying goes "you get what you pay for'. It offers cheap fares but 'you get what you pay for'.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Our second trip Melbourne to London return in Business Class. We were so impressed the first time that we decided to do it again this year. Of course the much lower price of just under $4000AUD for business class was a big deciding factor. But we did not select RBA just on price alone we consider the whole experience is far superior to many of the main airlines that we have used in the past. We will certainly keep on using them.

Our 81 year father flew business class from the UK to Australia with Royal Brunei. He was met at each stop and guided to the business Lounge then collected for boarding and looked after on the flight. Really cannot thank them enough for their care which was above what we expected. Food was good he is a basic eater and some of the options were not to his liking but otherwise excellent!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BKK 11/05/13 stop over in Brunei - from touch down to take off 1 hour max. Everything went smoothly friendly polite and well spoken flight staff snacks soft drinks nuts meals were great - good enough in my books. I will fly with them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I would recommend Royal Brunei business class as excellent value for money. The seats were comfy (if a bit old) the duvet and large pillow really helped you get some sleep the inflight entertainment was good and the service excellent. Entry into the business class lounges in Melbourne / Brunei Dubai and London was part of the ticket and made a difference. My only negative comment is the food is pretty average but in no way sufficient to say the experience is not excellent value for money.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew MEL-BKK-MEL twice so far. Flight on schedules with very attentive staff. Food and drink are adequate except no alcohol served. Entertainment is good. Overall RBA is a goo airlines with a very competitive price over others. Will continue using them.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-MEL-LHR. Booked due to low price stopped in Dubai and Brunei but turnaround well organised and a welcome break from the long flight. Food acceptable good check in online cabin crew efficient and attentive checking and cleaning the toilets. Plenty of soft drinks as airline does not serve alcohol. In flight entertainment showing current films.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
The cabin crew were attentive helpful and genuine. B777-200 spacious and comfortable leg room generous and seats were designed with storage areas footrest and lumbar support. The cushioning was perhaps a little hard with age but still comfortable. The inflight entertainment was straightforward to operate and on-demand worked well. The lack of alcohol (this is a no alcohol airline) did not bother me. Meals were generous and of good quality. Online Check In was straightforward and airport bag drop was fast and efficient.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Wonderful experience. The cabin crew were attentive and very pleasant planes were clean and rest was encouraged. Plenty of drinks offered. The food was good. Value for money is exceptional.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew one way MEL-MNL via BSB good value for money equipment is a 777-200er on the MEL-BSB and A320 to MNL. Overall good experience not at par with other big carriers but for the price this airline is well worth it. Only part I don't like is the 3.5 hrs wait time for the flight to MNL wish they could fix this in future.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-LHR-MEL July 2012. Delightful cabin crew. Crew cleaned toilets continually throughout the flight. Extra drink runs during the flight. Majority of sectors were 100% full. Comfortable seats with good pitch (even if they are a tad old) and a footrest. IFE a bit old but lasted the trip and movies were up to date. Food was edible the steak was a bit large for me though. Dry airline but that doesn't worry me. On-time departing and arriving.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Bangkok to Melbourne. Fast check in and excellent service from Bangkok to Brunei and then excellent service Brunei to Melbourne. Small but useful amenities bag delivered rather late on the second sector. Food menu same as 6 weeks earlier on Melbourne to Bangkok flights. Food was well prepared and presented. Good service and attentive cabin crew. IFE worked OK and some latest releases. Seat was comfortable but not horizontal. No alcohol on flight (it is possible to bring your own) but on really a problem. Bag received priority handling through to Melbourne - has been a problem at other times and with other airlines too. Given their value for money I will continue to fly them on a regular basis.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flight BI 874 KUL-BWN Feb 17 2013. No 'welcome' 'thank you' or 'goodbye'. No newspapers at all. No entertainment. No coffee / tea in my section. Only one choice of meal (beef) which I declined and wasn't offered as much as a packet of peanuts instead. Crew apathetic and struggling with basic English. I appreciate it is Chinese New Year season but surely that has been factored into the price of the ticket (RM1700+). I used to think about bringing my family to Brunei on vacation (as opposed to just business). After this flight I'm afraid it's not going to happen.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew BKK-BWN-DXB-LHR 5th Feb 2013. Flights on all sectors were on time check in staff excellent. Had a 4 hour lay over in BWN waiting for the flight to LHR via DXB the airport at BWN is small and boring but you can get a coffee etc. The flight from BWN was a 777 3-4-3 layout. Seats comfortable enough quite a small screen in the headrest in front of me the entertainment was good but you had no way of starting and stopping a movie etc it was on a loop. Food was better than I expected and had a choice plenty of water or juice handed out in the cabin during the flight. Stop at Dubai you have to get off the aircraft and re-board remember to take your boarding card with you you are off the plane for less than 1 hour and back in your original seat. I paid £230 one way ticket and would definitely use Royal Brunei again real value for money if travelling on a budget.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
The main reason for selecting Royal Brunei was the competitive price of $5000 for a business class return European flight. Being very tall I needed the legroom which I hoped their business class seats would provide. Staff really appeared to have little training in how to manage the needs of passengers on a long flight. The quality of the food when they remembered to serve it - sometimes the food was served over 2 hours into a sector - was very poor. They sometimes forgot to serve a course. When a course was served they sometimes did not serve the selection which we had previously made. The selection which we made on several legs seemed to become unavailable quite quickly. During the first sector out of Melbourne our attendant took 3 attempts to get a normal glass of water correct. The main expertise of the flight attendants was the handing out of hot towels which they did on a very regular basis. Our business class seats did not recline on 3 out of the 6 sectors - we had to change seats on 3 sectors so we could have seats which were able to fully recline. On the return leg from Europe there were some 5 seats which were marked up as being unable to be used. This meant that my wife had to accept a seat which was not able to fully recline for 3 of the return sectors. The Aircraft was also old and the quality of the entertainment was poor with most movies being pre 2005 and earlier. This made such a long flight even more boring.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-MEL return. Business Class. Just back from my 3 week trip. Thoroughly enjoyed my flights. Plenty of leg room. The seat reclines electronically to become a bed. Plenty to eat and for airline food I thought the standard was very acceptable. Cabin crew attentive smiley and helpful. The interior on all 777s I flew in is starting to look tired. Entertainment choices limited. The lack of alcohol is no problem. No dehydration or headaches that way. 3 hour transit at Brunei was a bit of a pain but the SkyLounge there was OK. No delays dramas all went as sweet as a nut. Pound for pound it was excellent value. Dubai transit is bonkers by the way but 3 x 7/8 hour legs was about as tolerable as such a trip gets. No hesitation in recommending this airline for service & value for money.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BSB-MEL. Although the flights themselves were OK we were delayed for 22 hours on the return leg. Such delays do occur however Royal Brunei's communication throughout this delay was appalling and the experience was very confusing and frustrating. Therefore I would never fly with them again and recommend others avoid this airline.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-MEL over Christmas period in economy. Flight crew could not have been more pleasant and smartly dressed. I'm a bit fussy for eating but the meals were excellent ok the entertainment system is a bit outdated and did need to be rebooted a few times. Overall I would recommend RBA to anyone.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BKK-MEL. Staff and service are good. The airport in Brunei is tiny and boring and can be a problem if your stop-over is more than 2 hrs. No alcohol served. Overall a good airline.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BKK-MEL. Staff were attentive efficient and always had a smile. The food was very good and the portions were more than enough. Seats were quite comfortable and almost lie flat. Inflight entertainment was a bit average. We were 1.5 hrs late leaving Brunei due to the aircraft leaving Dubai late but is was not a big deal. These things happen. Would without a doubt fly with RBA next time. Changing aircraft in Brunei the only negative but for the price you can't complain.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Heathrow to Melbourne in early December and made the return journey on New Years eve. Neither of us particularly enjoy flying but this was the most enjoyable long haul trip I have done and upgrading to Business Class was money well spent and in my view good value for money. Staff were friendly and helpful the food choice was good and varied. Entertainment system dated but still some good choices of film. Only drawback is Brunei airport which is very small and limited services which made the 4hr wait on flight home slightly dull! Would have preferred more time in Dubai airport which seemed to have a lot more going on. Overview a great experience that made the long journey more bearable.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
DXB-MEL return regularly. Terrible service recently and continues to decline! Reasonably priced but service seat comfort food and entertainment have become unacceptable. We were not given a choice of meals despite only being seated in row 2 seats malfunctioned flights delayed staff forgot to serve some members of our party quality of food was dire inedible in some sectors. Entertainment only offered 2 or 3 movies worth watching and IFE system often needed rebooting. Toilets not cleaned often enough and staff forgot to hand out priority gate passes and customs arrival forms Brunei airport lounge limited. No longer worth the hassle despite the cheap business class.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I flew LHR to Melbourne return over the Xmas period 2012. We booked RBA as it was around £400 cheaper than any other airline. Bag drop at the airport was efficient and I highly recommend online check-in as the line to drop bags off in this line was about 4 people vs the 50 or so in the non online check in. The weights for checking luggage was not strictly enforced but hand luggage was strictly enforced. On board there was more leg room than many I have travelled on which was great. Food was tasty although they do run out of the popular items quickly. Adding ice cream for the sweet was a nice touch. The cabin crew were very efficient and helpful. A press of the call button and they were with you within 20 seconds and always happy to help. All crews were far and above in terms of professionalism and helpfulness. I can highly recommend RBA for an efficient friendly airline.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne-London via Brunei and Dubai return. Staff on board were fantastic using our names each time a meal/drinks were served. Aircraft was a 777 with the Business class seats that just superseded flat bed angled type. Access to all the lounges along the way and back made the total flight enjoyable as the longest stretch was around 7 hours. Staff were friendly and the meals were fine. Certainly better than or equal to most other long distance airlines that I have travelled with into Asia.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BWN-MNL return. Best inflight catering I have experienced yet. No alcohol was not a problem I did take some and the cabin crew provided mixers. Cabin crew were attentive friendly and helpful. Planes had adequate legroom and were clean. Brunei's airport is small and not much to do it is about to be renovated. Fully recommend them.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew to Singapore and returned from Bangkok via Brunei. I didn't know what to expect as previous to this I had never heard of Royal Brunei. I found that economy was surprisingly spacious. Flights both ways were not full so had a spare seat next to me. Meals on board were more than enough however as I am a big eater the flight attendants were more than happy to accommodate this. The stopover in Brunei was only 45 minutes so the actual time spent doing nothing was about 15 minutes. The only problem if I had to pick on was the small screen sizes but in the end it didn't really bother me. Would definitely fly again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
As a large family group 15 we flew out of Melbourne via Brunei to Manila in late November. I was surprised by the excellent inflight service considering the cost the food was good and movies aplenty. My only reservation was the small airport at Brunei and the lack of food outlets inside the lounge there be prepared to pass the time ours was over 3hrs. The flight home was just as good as going there so not hard to recommend RBA my best trip yet and congratulations on picking up the ball that those bigger airline companies have dropped and running with it.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew Melbourne to Jakarta via Bandar Seri Begawan return. Overall my small family and I had an excellent experience. I am usually a bad flyer but staff were friendly and attentive and took care of my child's needs when it came to bassinets and so on. My wife preferred the Boeing 777 aircraft which although they are ten years old are well maintained and give you better leg space than other Asian based wide body cheaper carriers. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. I would fly with them again. No alcohol if not an issue for me.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-DXB-LHR. The most competitive flight direct into Dubai. We were a little apprehensive after reading a few reviews but where very surprised. The flight was excellent. Seat back entertainment attentive staff loads of legroom. Seat was a little hard but nothing else. The food was OK they ran out of all but fish pie on the outward journey but managed to fine a veggie option for my girlfriend. It was on time in and out so we have no complaints and would use them again with hesitation.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I travelled on this airline a little over a year ago and during then and now the services offered have deteriorated. The food on the outbound journey from Melbourne was dreadful - biscuits limp pastries over salted main meals and no fresh fruit except for one tiny one on the entire trip to London. They have obviously cut back on the quality of the food. Despite the food the seats were comfortable and the staff friendly. It was also a very cheap flight which may explain the quality of the food.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Heathrow - Brunei (via Dubai) - Manila and Manila - Brunei - Heathrow (via Dubai). For the price I paid was impressed with this Airline. Food was good as was the service. Cant remember a more comfortable seat in Economy. Entertainment was a little ancient but not an issue for me. The short stop in Dubai was a little chaotic and can imagine passengers roaming around the airport trying to find their way back to the flight. I think the planes are a little old but again no issue for me. All in all quite impressed.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-HKG-LHR. The airline itself was fantastic comfortable the food was good and throughout the night the flight attendants walked down the aisles offering additional drinks. Toilets were regularly cleaned throughout the long flight. Our entertainment wasn't working properly on the way out. There's a stop in Dubai before Brunei which was annoying walking from one end to the other not really having any time to get any duty free (they don't have any at Brunei airport as Dry state). The transit stop in Brunei was painful there's nothing to do. Only one food outlet which was a coffee shop the toilets were disgusting. We only stopped for 2 hours! Royal Brunei is a good airline if your main priority is price and you don't care how you get to this destination otherwise I won't be using them again to Hong Kong - the journey was far too long!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to London return Excellent value for money attentive FA's who tended to our needs especially as we are a very big family of 7 with the children aged 18-9 years. The cabin was clean and well presented. The toilets were kept clean. The foot rests were a great addition. Inflight entertainment was good however my eldest daughters didn't work on the way back but she shared her sisters screen. The food was of a high standard and they supplied nutritious vegan food for me. The stop in Dubai while short was good to be able to get out and stretch Dubai airport was clean big with plenty to do. The 3 hr stop in Brunei was again good to stretch but boring and the toilets were disgusting.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We found the Royal Brunei Airline experience was not good for families with young children. The only positive was that air hosts/esses were generally helpful and friendly. In our purchased tickets it said nothing about the additional stopover in Dubai. This was very unsettling for little ones trying to sleep then had to walk the circuit of Dubai airport waiting over an hour only to get back on the plane. Then a wait of 2.5 hours before it quietened down enough for them to sleep. Kids meals were not great and our children are not normally fussy. Kids entertainment was also poor. I would definitely recommend taking your ipad. Finally as we left Heathrow to travel back to Melbourne we purchased some gifts. Being aware of the alcohol restrictions on the plane I clarified this with the sales assistant who assured me it was ok to take aboard. Nothing was mentioned about the alcohol when boarding on the plane at Heathrow. Nor through the Dubai check. However at the last point it was confiscated in Brunei. Everyone felt extremely frustrated and angry that this was not made clear before purchases were made. Obviously no one would have wasted their money if they knew it would be taken away. Overall I would not recommend this airline to families with young children.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Bangkok-Melbourne. Quick and efficient check in at Bangkok. Flight left on time for Brunei. Choice of breakfast served early in flight. IFE a bit limited but not a problem on the short sector. Flight from Brunei to Melbourne was about 40 minutes late because of technical problems. Sat on the tarmac for a while and then good flight to Melbourne. Lunch was served at a very leisurely pace and was good food on good china and cutlery. IFE quite good and seats were very comfortable. They made up most of the lost time en route. Service friendly and addressed by name. Changed seats before flight took off and no problems with staff. Business class almost full but service remained good and friendly for the whole flight. They are a three star airline but give excellent value for money and while this remains I will happily fly with them. Baggage did not priority treatment during the unloading phase at Melbourne airport. ( I am not sure if this is an airline or a ground handling problem as it has also occurred on other airlines where baggage is checked in and has to be transferred to a second or third flight).

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
My wife and I visit family annually in Australia. We prefer to fly British Airways Virgin or Emirates but have flown Royal Brunei a couple of times. They are a decent enough airline well priced and can provide a good stop over in Brunei. However only use them if you don't require any further connections in Oz or the UK. My wife got delayed on the Qantas connection from Canberra to Melbourne because of fog. She missed the Brunei plane and then discovered because it was a Saturday Royal Brunei had no staff at the airport. They did have a contact number in Brunei but this went unanswered for a few hours. Then my wife was put on hold internationally for 20 minutes before finally being told she would need to buy another ticket for a further £600. In the end she travelled back the next day Emirates. We travel a fair bit but this was still stressful and very expensive. Until Royal Brunei can offer adequate customer service at the airports they serve I would only use them for direct hub to hub flights. Otherwise use BA/Qantas or Emirates who connect through Qantas in Oz or Virgin who obviously have a connection through Virgin Blue.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Having chosen this airline based on reviews here and the competitive price of a return ticket from London to Melbourne I was not disappointed. Service by flight attendants was top-notch even in the dead of night. The Boeing 777s might not be the latest but they are still up to the task; the seats were comfortable and the IFE was perfectly adequate. As previous reviews have pointed out Brunei airport can't presently be compared with Singapore or even Kuala Lumpur but as the cabin crew pointed out on landing there on both the outbound and return legs the airport is undergoing substantial renovation so there's hope for a better layover experience. My only slight gripe was that only one meal was served on the outbound leg from Brunei to Melbourne - lunch - with no snacks or other food served before landing which seemed a bit stingy given the length of the flight. That said the food served was generally excellent - tasty and better than other airline food I've eaten in the past! Boarding at Brunei on the return leg from there to Dubai was a little chaotic but this might have been the fault of the airport rather than the airline. The 2 stop itinerary - Dubai and Brunei - actually suited me quite well as I hate being cooped up in a plane for hours on end. Given the great level of customer service on board and the competitive pricing this airline has a lot to recommend it.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR to MEL return - out 23 Aug return 19 Sep 2012. Overall flight experience was excellent. 777 aircraft clean and modern food more than adequate staff were courteous attentive and efficient; seat comfortable and toilets always clean. The entertainment package was pretty good although TV system was flaky on two of the legs. Dubai stop-over was bizarre involving disembarking and ambling around the airport back to the departure gate (don't misplace your boarding pass from LHR as it is required for this process). Brunei stop- over was fine. The terminal is dated but OK for a couple of hours wait between flights. There were two decent places to eat which take plastic so no local currency change involved. Free Wi-Fi from the Coffee Bean café available throughout the departure lounge. Some duty free shops but if you are expecting the Singapore Airport retail experience you will be disappointed. Toilets were dated but very clean and definitely not a problem as has been alluded to in other posts. Duty free alcohol purchases from LHR are not allowed to be taken back onto the MEL connecting flight – this Australian Government regulation seemed to catch some people out although it is mentioned on the RBA website. Flight was originally selected for competitive price but their excellent customer service (higher than many larger airlines) means that I would not hesitate to recommend Royal Brunei Airlines or fly with them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to London return. The Business Class deal was two for the price of one. The whole trip was most satisfactory. Pleasant service. Food not brilliant excellent flat bed seats. The timetable really worked for my wife and me. A very civilised mid day departure out of Melbourne and a not too early arrival into London Heathrow. Return flight left at 10am and got into Melbourne at 9pm the following day. I was very surprised that the 2 stop flight seemed less arduous than the usual one stop flight with most other carriers. Lounges are fine Royal Brunei use the United Lounge in Melbourne their own in Brunei of course and the excellent Etihad lounge in London. A very nice way to start a long journey. The no alcohol policy is no problem. You can buy supplies at the duty free and the cabin crew will happily serve you on board. The inflight entertainment is a bit bland and of course is nowhere near the state of the art systems. Would I Fly BI again? Absolutely.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to London return. Flights departed and arrived on time. Seemed to have more leg room than other economy airlines. Inflight food was excellent a constant supply of soft drinks juices but no snacks offered between meals. Flight attendants courteous and attentive also making sure toilets etc were always clean and tidy. Entertainment could do with an upgrade not a lot to choose from. Cabin crew will allow you to move around if there are spare seats so you can stretch out over 3 seats to sleep. Brunei Transit Lounge toilets need upgrading best to avoid if you can. Small cafe will only accept Brunei or Singapore $ but does have free WiFi. Stop in Dubai to refuel bit of a pain as it is a very long walk to go through customs and back to transit considering the transit lounge is near exit from plane. Overall for the price the airline is very good value and I would travel again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-BWN-HKG. Not the conventional way of getting to HKG but price was right and with less than an hour in transit the connection was a breeze even though most of the pax were in transit to Melbourne. Check-in at LHR was painfully slow and waited over an hour as there were only 3 Y class desks available. Good crew and food above average notably on the BWN-HKG sector. No alcohol served but plenty of beverage runs. Entertainment system on long haul is ok but some fairly up to date releases and on demand. If not in a hurry RBA is a fairly good option.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Great value for money. Economy seat has more leg room than most. Flight attendants were friendly caring and ready to help. Refreshments served on a regular basis and inflight food was more than acceptable. Aircraft looks well maintained and clean. Entertainment system is not on demand so one has to be quick to catch the films before they play. I preferred to sleep. Brunei airport has very limited products and services so allowing us to browse and shop through Dubai Duty Free was a good thing. The airport cafe had wifi but a bit pricey with their limited products and drinks range. When my 6 year old son developed a fever on board they alerted a medic before landing to make sure he will be fine. Caring flight crew made that flight so much better than most.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to Bangkok. Flight left and arrived in Bangkok on time with a tight but manageable change of planes in Brunei. Service was good but unobtrusive. No alcohol but plenty of other drinks. The seats were comfortable but a fully flat bed would have been better. Food was hot tasty and enjoyable.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We flew at the start of June to London the flight was enjoyable the captain gave regular updates. Food was actually very good and they did their best to accommodate our 2 year old if there were spare seats they moved us around so we had more room. Stopovers are short about 1-2hrs at Brunei and 45mins at Dubai. I was happy with the service attendants provided and the plane was nice enough. Our TV didn't work on two occasions which was a nuisance and on the way back at Heathrow it took much longer than expected for our gate to open which left a lot of people confused and frustrated however I am not sure if this was the airlines fault or the airport. Also the in flight entertainment wasn't the best not many movies or TV shows was disappointing for such a long flight. Overall pleasant experience and would fly them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Had the misfortune of flying this airline on Saturday 11th August 2012. After leaving Manila for a 2 hour stopover in Bandar Seri Begawan this turned into a 30 hour stopover after the plane broke down! We were all left in the dark and had no idea what was going to happen 5 hours later staff informed us that we would be staying the night we were finally bussed to a motel and stayed the night. The following day when we were about to take off the Captain said on the intercom that they had made a mistake with the weight calculation and would need to take on more fuel. As a regular traveler I will never ever fly with this airline again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Business class from Melbourne to London in late June 2012 returning in mid-July. Excellent value for money. Whilst not new the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft were cleaned and well maintained and departed and arrived on time. Cabin staff were attentive and looked after the nearly full forward section with charm and consideration. Royal Brunei used the United Airlines lounge in Melbourne and a generic multi-airline lounge in Dubai where beer wines and spirits were available though none were served in flight. I found the three seven hour flying time (approx) "legs" (Melbourne-Brunei Brunei-Dubai Dubai-London Heathrow) convenient and the food and beverages served more than adequate. Whist the service was not up to the standard of other airlines neither was the price. Criticisms include the use of Heathrow's ageing and distant Terminal 4 and the lack of dedicated Business class gates at Dubai and BSB. Overall an enjoyable experience.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
The price was right for MEL-MNL. Flights on time each sector flight attendants friendly and efficient food was OK for airline food. The wait time while transiting at Brunei was acceptable and with a good attitude was a fair enough airport. Will fly with them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
First time and hopefully the last time. Return business flights from LHR to Dubai. Support staff very unhelpful with assistance. Additional baggage costs a rip off with other airlines you can pre-book an additional 23 kilo at reasonable cost or even pay a reasonable charge at the booking in desk. It is cheaper to send baggage express delivery than Royal Brunei charges. Business seats are too close and shabby. Flight staff are friendly and good service provided. Airport staff are unhelpful.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I have to fly Royal Brunei every week with great reluctance. Out of 10 trips in 10 weeks the plane has been delayed by more than 45 minutes twice causing me to miss my flight connections. Let's not even talk about smaller time delays. When I was flying business from BWN to BKI on 19 April 2012 the flight was delayed and I was not going to be able to make my connection. I asked the staff in the business lounge whether she could switch my flight to Singapore and she said she had to ask her manager to come to a decision whether they could switch my flight. The manager took more than 20 minutes to arrive and because of that they couldn't issue me a flight ticket due to the fact that we were too close to the boarding time for Singapore. The attitudes of attendants and the bureaucratic decision making hierarchy of Royal Brunei creates a highly antagonistic customer environment. In addition for the past 3 months that I have been flying Royal Brunei the online check in facility isn't available. Imagine that from a full-service airline! I prefer to fly budget airlines over Royal Brunei anytime.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Never again. Was seated directly in front of a school sports team the boy behind me was emanating what can only be described as a stench. I soon realised it was his sports shoes. The stewardesses did nothing. It is their duty to solve such issues. Food was average - somehow they didn't have my vegetarian meal on the London-Dubai leg. Brunei airport is like a remote outpost with bathrooms to match. On the upside flights were on time. Definitely a budget airline which explains the school group.

I staff in the business lounge whether she could switch my flight to Singapore and she said she had to ask her manager. The manager took more than 20 minutes to arrive and because of that they couldn't issue me a ticket due to the fact that we were too close to the boarding time for Singapore. The attitudes of attendants creates a highly antagonistic customer environment. In addition for the past 3 months that I have been flying Royal Brunei the online check in facility isn't available. Imagine that from a full-service airline! I prefer to fly budget airlines over Royal Brunei anytime.

Bangkok to Melbourne. Attentive flight attendants with good service all the way. Food plentiful and tasty. Food was well presented and hot. Cabin attendants were cheerful and very pleasant. Seats were comfortable and enabled good rest especially between Brunei and Melbourne. Flights departed and arrived on time. Now my first choice for flights from Australia to Asia and beyond.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to London return. Staff were attentive and catering was good. Seats wee comfortable and inflight entertainment of good quality. Toilets cleaned constantly throughout the flight. Our 11 year old doesn't travel well and was ill both ways and stewards dealt with this competently and compassionately. Actually liked the opportunity to get off at Brunei and Dubai although Brunei airport needs improving. You do need to go through security again both times which became very tedious particularly for those who were carrying water.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew Melbourne-Bangkok return with a stopover in Brunei. A nice airline with a better-than-average economy class. The staff were friendly and efficient and the seat had better leg room than many. Very good value compared to other airlines on the route and better service.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to Bangkok. Very good flight friendly flight attendants and a tight connection in Brunei made easily. Seats were comfortable. No problems food was good and plentiful. No alcohol served but told I could have taken a bottle of wine. Happily fly them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew LHR-MEL-LHR. Cabin staff are fantastic. Seats comfortable and aircraft clean. Have flown Qantas and Malaysia Airlines on the same route and ahead of Malaysia in all aspects. Far less stress and no drunks.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne-Heathrow over Easter 2012. Travelled economy class and appreciated both the value for money and the inflight service. Crew were very efficient and attentive. They routinely cleaned the toilets! Peaceful flights both ways and plenty of empty seats to snooze on on the second leg to/from Dubai. Only grizzle is the efficiency of the airport staff at Brunei who struggled to issue Boarding Passes on the homeward leg to a tired and grumpy group of passengers.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Excellent service and attentive staff. Wide seating converts to full length bed. Innovative and satisfactory meals. Good selection of fruit juices. Good time keeping seamless connecting flights. Enjoyed a very peaceful and restful flight from Melbourne to London.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-LHR-MEL. Our expectations were exceeded. Value for money using economy seating was excellent. Seat spacing seemed better than our experience with Qantas. Gluten Free meals supplied for my wife were ok. Meals and refreshments were generally very good. Would be happy to fly them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne to Bangkok via Brunei. Both sectors departed and arrived on time. Both aircraft clean and comfortable. Very good service from flight attendants. Only 4 in Business Class so almost one to one service. No alcohol served but BYO not a problem in moderation. Excellent English from Cabin Crew. No priority passes for immigration in Bangkok. Excellent value for money.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Travelled from New Zealand to London. Unfortunately Royal Brunei are no longer travelling to NZ but they arranged connecting flights. Planes immaculate and the service we received from the cabin crew was fantastic. The airport in Brunei is basic but there are no long delays. Onboard entertainment was up to date with recent movie releases.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Brunei-Kota Kinabalu. Very short flight on A319. On time. The business class cabin had a total of two rows (8 seats). Seats are comfortable with lots of legroom. Cabin crew were friendly. Some fruit juice was served prior to departure but there was no meal/drink service during that short flight. The business class lounge at Brunei airport was quite nice with not a bad choice of warm/cold food and drinks.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-LHR-MEL. Staff attentive seats relatively comfortable in Economy. We were lucky enough to have a row to ourselves on 2 of the legs. Bandar airport was boring but they are upgrading it so who knows.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
SIN-BWN-SIN - both legs scheduled to be operated by A320-200. On the way to BWN the aircraft an A320-200 was very clean and the crew extremely courteous. Inflight meal was bland but other than that I have no comments. No AVOD but a documentary was shown on drop-down screens. On the return leg the equipment was changed to new B777-200ERs. The cabin crew service level and meal satisfaction level were slightly higher and there was AVOD. The seats were much wider than the A320. All in all a good travel experience and fairly good value for money.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Melbourne-London-Melbourne. Good service quality food entertainment comfort (in economy) cleanliness including toilets and friendly professional staff. With no alcohol served I found this refreshing with quieter passengers overall. The route through Brunei and Dubai was particularly successful with 3 legs of very reasonable length (6-8 hrs) and stopover’s were not too long 1-3 hrs.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Just returned Melbourne to London in Business class. Great staff service good food and comfortable seats (for angle lie flat). No alcohol may be problem for some people but did not worry us. Would definitely recommend. Not really a grip but a comment is that the range of movies on IFE was limited but at least the IFE worked without a hitch unlike many other airlines that I have been on.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-DXB-BWN-KUL return and although the stop in BWN is boring and makes the journey very long it is great value for money. We travelled with a baby and staff couldn't be more helpful! Entertainment is ok. Only because of the amount of stopovers I will be flying Emirates again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Great veggie food option. Courteous helpful staff who regularly came through with drinks. Not enough leg room for tall husband. Inflight entertainment had plenty of choice. Unable to check-in online which is a worry for a family wanting to be sure of sitting together.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BSB with short refuelling at Dubai then on to LHR. Flight crew were attentive and courteous. Planes were clean. Seats more than comfortable for the long haul with plenty of space. Abundant entertainment with variety of movies music and games. Food excellent.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
BKI-BWN-BKI. A short flight. Staff very kind. The plane was in good condition and seats comfortable enough. Ground services were ok. No entertainment on this flight and only snacks due to the shortness of the flying time.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
London to Melbourne Dec 2011 return Jan 2012. I found the staff were helpful and efficient. I had to extend my stay in Melbourne and found the Royal Brunei Staff helpful and professional in dealing with the arrangements. I found the Passenger Assistance Service excellent.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
London-Brunei (via Dubai) on to Singapore return Hong Kong-Brunei then Brunei-London (via Dubai). Stop- over gave a chance to stretch legs leaving baggage on plane. Flights on time in 777 planes. Food was pleasantly varied. Staff were courteous and friendly. Entertainment was varied. No alcohol but you can take your own. Lots of fruit juices offered on a regular basis. Staff spoke good English and were happy to talk to passengers. Brunei terminal is satisfactory but toilets are basic. A great experience at a good price.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Dubai from LHR. Boeing 777 200ER. Extremely punctual polite and professional. Great value. Would say that the seats on the outbound aircraft had more room (I was in economy). They really were spacious. On way home had a feeling that it was a bit more cramped. Cabin Crew extremely pleasant. Smooth flights. Would recommend to anybody.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We flew from London to Melbourne return. We got a great deal in business class and the flights were above expectations. Used the Etihad lounge at Heathrow the United lounge at Melbourne and had lounge access during the short stop in Dubai. No alcohol is served onboard the plane but we didn't really miss this and all the of meals were very good. Cabin crew were very good and professional. We had 15 hours in Brunei on the return leg and were given a room at the Radison hotel for about 11 hours. All flights were on Boeing 777. We would happily use them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew Dubai-Melbourne return in business class. Staff were attentive the aircraft cabins B777 were well presented despite their age. The angled lie flat seats were more than comfortable and I managed to sleep. Only down side is the airport in Brunei which has very limited facilities although we timed our flight so we only had a two hour stop over. Overall for the price we paid we had an extremely pleasant trip.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I fly between Singapore and Brunei at least once a month. The price charged is not cheap compared to Singapore Airlines. The entertainment onboard never changes and are very boring. For flights with individual screens they don't work. Check-in can be a nightmare especially during Ramadan. Nothing is done to manage the growing queue. It makes no difference if you check-in online or not. They don't announce delayed flights. There is hardly any leg room when seated seats are narrow and uncomfortable. When arriving in Brunei be prepared for long queues for immigration and custom clearance. Average time to clear immigration is about 30 mins. Airport Staff airport are not proficient in English.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Economy on the Boeing 777 LHR-DXB-LHR. Seats were pretty comfortable set up as 3-3-3 with 18" width and 32-34" pitch which is more generous than others. Food was pretty good. Though alcohol is not served onboard apparently you may take some yourself. There is Video on demand with a range of decent films 'radio stations' or entire albums. Service was ok with the staff coming through the cabin with a tray of soft drinks regularly.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BWN-BKK and KUL-BWN-MEL. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive seats comfortable food adequate and inflight entertainment good. Both flights between Melbourne and Brunei were half full so my partner and I had 3 seats allowing us to stretch out. I am 6'3" and staff endeavoured to provide seats with extra leg room which was appreciated. There is not much to the airport in Brunei so if you have a long stopover I suggest having snacks and a good book. The bathrooms leave something to be desired. All in all a great flying experience.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
PER-BKK-PER via Brunei and was quite impressed. Flights were on time A319/320 aircraft immaculate service friendly and food good. Seats reasonably comfortable though my shins hit the seat in front. Inflight entertainment wasn't much but didn't mind for the fare paid.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BWN-BKI return. I have flown with this airline a couple of times and generally happy with their service. My recent flights (four legs in total) all left in a timely and efficient manner. The food onboard was poor this time around (and I'm pretty easy to please) but for the discount fare I paid this didn't bother me too much. What was disconcerting was the Begawan to Melbourne return leg where my wife and I were separated by 20 rows. Given I booked and paid for the flight well in advance this wasn't appreciated at all!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-LHR return. Boeing 777 spacious business class cabin angled lieflat seats which are comfortable in a 2x2x2 configuration - large pillow and duvet. The cabin crew were professional well groomed and attentive . The service food and beverage was just as good as many major airlines and plenty of it. No alcohol served however a large selection of non-alcoholic beverages was offered. The entertainment system was okay - could benefit from an upgrade and a lot more variety! Brunei airport is very small and easy to navigate. The RBA Business Class Lounge serves the purpose but is pretty basic.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
AKL-LHR via BWN and DXB on Boeing 777 the return flight of my £549 fare. Service was attentive although the interior is starting to show its age. Inflight entertainment was adequate with a new selection of movies compared with the trip over. Food met expectations and staff kept us well watered.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
NZ to London return. The seats are a bit old but comfortable and of sufficient length to fully stretch out. The food is of a very good standard and served at a time that suits the passenger. The 2 stops seemed to break the journey up into manageable sectors that allowed a leg stretch at approx 8 hr intervals. The entertainment system worked well and particularly in the audio sector the range of music was great. It is a great pity that they are ceasing this service latter this month otherwise we would definitely fly them again next year.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Travelled Economy Class LHR to AKL via DXB and BWN. Paid £549 for a return flight which is basically half-price. Service was attentive and cabins well presented. Inflight entertainment was adequate - movies are on-demand if you use the on-demand interface. Same movies both legs though so hoping they'll change the movies on the way back. Food met expectations recommend the chilli fish. Drinks were offered at regular intervals. I am tall (6.3") and had plenty of room in Economy. I hear they are discontinuing the service to AKL but would fly with Royal Air Brunei again without hesitation.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I flew to Australia this year and as a diabetic traveller found the service onboard excellent the cabin crew were extremely courteous polite and helpful. The fares were economic and the aircraft comfortable. Overall very impressed.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland to Brunei. Plane is a leased Singapore 777-200 and seats have loads of room with good entertainment system. Plane was half full so had 3 seat between the 2 of us. It was a night flight with a 2am departure so while meals were good we were not hungry. Staff made plenty of water or juice runs almost every 20 mins. All in all a great flight and we were suitable impressed.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland to Brunei. Plane half empty seats comfortable - seemed more leg room than most. Cabin staff helpful but not always too efficient. Meals good with generous portions and choice. Be aware this is a 'dry' airline - no alcohol. Flight from Brunei to London packed staff more efficient well organised.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
First trip from Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur via Brunei. Extremely good value for money crew are attentive and ensure you are well looked after. We travelled with a disabled child and the service was great. Stop in Brunei can be tiresome.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland to London was okay considering the price. Gluten free option was just fruit so was starving by the time I arrived. Cabin crew from Brunei to London sat and chatted behind the curtain and it was left up to you to find drinks.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
BWN-Auckland return on B777-200ER. Outbound food and service good. Unlucky for me on return route the food is poor seat is Poor (seat cannot recline and hard).

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Food poor and lukewarm seats comfortable. Service not great had to ask for a couple of drinks as only a bottle of water given the whole flight. Toilets not that clean and cabin staff all stay at front of plane behind a curtain and are not seen for most of the flight. Entertainment not great choice of films.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
On time and staff were brilliant. The food on all 4 flights was spot on the only down fall for the airline is the Airport in Brunei. It is getting better with more shops but still a long way to go.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Just returned from a trip to Shanghai from Brisbane in Business Class - first time in the 777's. The trip was excellent and price very low due to discontinuing Brisbane service meals were good and service good. No alcohol is not a problem you can bring your own but we did not bother - beds lie flat but ok.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
KL-Melbourne. As a frequent traveller I found it impressive. They were punctual kind and the aircraft was absolutely comfortable. No alcohol was served which was not a problem at all.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Travelled with 3 small children from NZ-UK and found the flights adequate. Was put off Brunei entirely though by a rude air hostess during our 10 hr stop over in Brunei who wanted to take away one of our 4 seats as we hadn't paid for it but wouldn't give us a bassinette instead meaning two adults with a child each on their lap for 16 hr flight. Was not impressed its not like anyone was going to book the seat in that space of time. Got the seat back with some serious negotiation (she blocked it so no one could book it in the 5hrs till boarding) but got the impression the girl was bored and just wanted something to do! Brunei airport is incredibly boring so avoid long stops there! Thankfully I was well prepared for the kids so they coped well but we did find the stop frustrating in Dubai where despite having just a fuel stop you have to get off go through xray and screening again find your gate and wait to board the exact same plane again - just for a 1hr fuelling stop. Not fun with kids. Not very friendly airline but cheap.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Planes could do with some servicing for example most reading lights do not work. 3 out of my 4 flights were delayed with the first by 4.5 hrs though the Royal Brunei website still showed it as being on time. Half the meals were OK half were inedible. A warning to anyone flying Royal Brunei - you will probably be forced to transit in Brunei where the poorly serviced transit lounge has a few overpriced souvenir shops and any Duty Free goods will be "confiscated" by the security staff even though they are sealed. It was cheap and I like the uniforms on the hostesses though.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Took Royal Brunei BI 422 from Spore to Melbourne-transit at Brunei. On arriving at Brunei we were informed that our flight was cancelled. We were asked to wait while staff arranged flight back to Spore at 1830hrs . On arriving at Singapore-went to transit desk and took our boarding passes. My 2 children and I spent the whole day just travelling from Singapore to Brunei and back to Singapore again!! On board SQ 237 to our disappointment there was no Halal food for 3 of us as I presumed Royal Brunei staff will arrange for us. We were exhausted and hungry!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We were delighted with our trip on Royal Brunei. The check in was easy the seats and leg room good. We were very impressed with the staff. The toilets were cleaned more than I have ever seen on any other airline. Only downside was that it was quite cold for some of the flight but the air quality was good. Loved the day stopover in Brunei. So sorry they are discontinuing the service to Auckland.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland-London Economy class. All in all an excellent experience and much more than I was expecting given the cost of the ticket it truly surpassed all my expectations. Cabin crew were very attentive and always willing to help. We flew with a toddler and they took extra care of us. Our travel agent made an error and booked an infant meal when it should have been a child's meal the staff went out of their way to find suitable food and made sure that the meals were correct on the next to legs of the journey. It was good to get off the plane in Brunei and Dubai to stretch your legs. The fasten seat belts sign did not come on for turbulence once the whole way from Auckland-London and I felt the flight crew were trying to avoid bad weather to make the flight more comfortable. Leg room was better than others I have flown on and the 777 makes for a smooth ride. Would highly recommend - it is a real shame that they are suspending this route from October as I would definitely fly with them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
There were 3 of us flying NZ-UK return via Brunei and Dubai. This was excellent value for money the seats worked out to be about 70% of what other airlines were charging for Business Class and we thought that the service might have been compromised because of this but that was not the case at all. The cabin staff were very friendly attentive and helpful. The food was good and there was plenty of it also if you wanted to eat at different times due to having to work or wanting to sleep the staff were more than accommodating. The seats were comfortable and once you had mastered the controls it was easy to find a position that suited and there was a good sleeping position between the 3 of us we averaged 7-10 hrs of sleep time each on the flight. The pillows and duvets were great and really gave it a "going to bed to sleep feel". Check in was fast and hassle free from professional staff. We actually enjoyed the 2 stop break up of the flight as it gave us a chance to stretch our legs and break the long journey into more manageable chunks. Yes the interior is a little "tired" but I wouldn't go as far as to call it shabby and if that is the reason for the cheaper ticket then what great value for our money we got! Highly recommended!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
New Zealand-London with Royal Brunei and definitely would choose Air New Zealand next time. The food was abysmal particularly the kids meals. I don't know of many young kids who would eat silverbeet! So the kids were exhausted and starving by the time we got here. The adult meals were unappetising and tiny. We will be taking our own food for the return flight! The extra stop over in Dubai was frustrating too. I would not recommend Royal Brunei to anyone travelling with children.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I have flown to and from New Zealand to the UK twice in 2 yrs and have had only one problem. The screen in front of me was not working and eventually they found me another seat so I could watch a movie. However the Royal Skies loyalty programme for frequent fliers seems to be faulty as my they have recorded my flights but not issued any earned miles. An e mail request for information resulted in a form letter that was not helpful.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland-Heathrow return. A very good overall experience. Check-in efficient in Auckland and London. Cabin staff pleasant and attentive. Food very good although choice of meal not always available. Good IFE lots of movies but not the latest blockbusters. Seats comfortable and recline to almost flat for sleeping. Duvet and big pillows appreciated. Airport lounges were excellent. In Auckland had the use of Qantas lounge and in London the Etihad lounge - both very good. In Brunei the Royal Brunei lounge was very comfortable all facilities very clean and the food was excellent. Would definitely fly Royal Brunei again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Brisbane to Hong Kong Business Class. The service and food was brilliant - not as good as Singapore however not far behind. I would definitely recommend them.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I have travelled several times with Royal Brunei Airlines and have had good experiences every time. The stopover in Dubai enables you to stretch your legs and the airline has provided hotel accommodation for long stopovers in Brunei. I have stayed in 2 different hotels there and both were clean comfortable with swimming pools. Those who have a shorter stopover can take advantage of a free trip round the capital. I have always found that food and drink have been plentiful and the staff helpful.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
London to Manila via Dubai and Brunei. You stop at Dubai for 2 hrs then a two hour stop at Brunei makes the journey very long. Service was good food okay but not enough tea/coffee served during the flight.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
London-Bandar Seri Begawan stop over Dubai then change to HKG. Boeing 777-200 not too old not dirty cabin crew friendly and service pretty good. Seat layout is very reasonable 3-3-3. Enough leg room food not very good but not too bad - but the total flight time is over 20 hrs.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Food wasn't the best I've had but it was edible. Plane was very cold on all flights - the stopovers were very annoying waiting around and everybody trying to get off the plane at once. Cabin crew friendly and attentive although I didn't liked getting woken up on my way from Brunei to Hong Kong asking if I wanted some food.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland to heathrow and back cabin freezing on all flights - very uncomfortable. Staff good food not that good often cold. I would fly again if price was right but stop at Dubai/Brunei very tiring as you cannot sleep. Toilets smelly even though the staff cleaned them told it was a new aircraft but it was not.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Business Class into Brunei and back to Brisbane on more of an experience likened to "can't be bothered with you class". Safety instructions barely comprehensible no indication of where toilets are curtains drawn all night where staff congregate and socialize but you will see no staff all night. Breakfast terrible - no other offerings are given to you due to the excuse "we don't have any". The staff were very offhandish only one toilet was offered for use of all business class passengers as the opposite toilet was closed during the trip. At 5pm in the afternoon the blinds on every window had been drawn by staff and we were expected to go to sleep which about 5 of the 12 or so travellers were doing in the darkened cabin. A member of staff doing a surprise stroll to other end of aircraft nastily says "keep your voices down as other people are sleeping". We were chatting to each other in our seats quietly. This was a disrespectful nasty stewardess with bad attitude. I would never fly with this airline again. Try to find their website with the complaints or public relations section I believe it is impossible to find.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Brisbane to Kota Kinabalu via Brunei Kuala Lumpur to Brisbane via Brunei in economy. I was pleasantly surprised with service - courteous and attentive. Requests for gluten free food met and quite tasty. Seats ok and reasonably comfortable.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-BKI-BWN-DXB-LHR on economy with family including kids. Very reasonably priced tickets and although B777s (leased from Singapore Airlines) are showing their age. AVOD was limited compared to the latest systems on gulf airlines. The cost cutting was evident : very poor quality meals no toys for the kids limited choice of newspapers. Cabin crew were indifferent and not particularly friendly. I used to fly the airline regularly over a decade ago when it would have easily earned 4 stars but for the price I paid I can have no complaints.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BWN (777) BWN-BKK (A320). Booked this flight several months in advance at an almost impossible price (at least $300 cheaper other airlines). First flight was on a very old 777 but well maintained. I slept most of the flight only waking to eat. Attendants friendly and welcoming. Second flight was on a newer A320. Again attendants fantastic and extremely polite and attentive. Despite being a shorter flight we were offered hot meals which were delicious considering the price we paid.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
MEL-BWN on B777 BWN-SGN on A319. Both full flights seat pitch on 777 quite good (with pillows & blankets) A319 not so good. Food out of MEL at 0050 was a sandwich handed out with no description but a choice of 2 hot breakfast options as we approached BWN. Water/juice handed out at regular intervals as well as hot towels. IFE with good selection of movies worked well on the 777 - no complaints. BWN airport is very basic but we chose flight connections with less than 1 hour. There was a right kerfuffle over a family seating allocation on the BWN-SGN flight which was fun to watch as voices raised and only sorted out when 2 people stood up and offered to move to fix the situation.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Flew to Perth on new 777 aircraft. We ordered low fat meals and they were excellent. Cabin crew friendly and always available. Soft drinks available and the legroom was good. Timed our stopovers so that we only had 1 hours in Brunei and Dubai. The complaint I have is regarding the inflight entertainment too limited but you cant have it all.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-AKL in Business on the old Singapore 777's. The cabin was a little tired but for the price was fine. Found service from crew excellent. There always seemed to be someone there when you needed them. All addressed you by name and very respectful. I was a little sceptic as to what the seat would be like as there is no information on the Royal Brunei website at all! Was an angled lie-flat seat and I did manage to sleep on all flights. Pillow and duvet were really good. IFE fine food was a little strange. On the Brunei website they say that food is on demand. That wasn't the case. The crew came around with a badly photocopied menu saying that because it was the end of the month the menu was changing so they didn't have any. I only ate one main course on all of my sectors which was an overcooked steak with lumpy mash. The food at the lounges was good so we ate there. There seems to be a little confusion from others re the Alcohol situation. The crew will provide mixers and ice etc but you must pour your own spirits. Alcohol is not allowed through Brunei unless it has been sealed by Duty Free so for out of LHR you are fine. Dubai - Brunei fine if you want Alcohol on your sector from Brunei - wherever it has to be taken into Brunei sealed declared to customs and them not unsealed until you are on the plane out of Brunei. We had one of the long 10 hour stopovers in Brunei. Outside the airport was chaos 300 odd people who didn't know where they were going. Just because you are in business class you still have to go on the bus to the hotels however we were given a nicer hotel. The Rizquin very nice and attached to a shopping centre which was handy. All of the food at the hotel was paid for including room service. Lounge at Brunei was tiny but had everything you need. Showers wi-fi etc and the best Beef Rendang!. All flights between London and Brunei stop in Dubai when you have to do a strange walk around in a circle and through security but it was nice to stretch our legs. I would fly with them again if the cost difference is as great.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Heathrow to Auckland via Dubai/Brunei. Staff were attentive IFE adequate seats extremely good and food as good as any we've had on a plane. There is no problem taking alcohol on board for personal consumption and we took gin both in and out of Brunei without any problem - a superb airline at affordable prices.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Heathrow-Brisbane return. I am coeliac and have a gluten free diet which was served without a problem and was very good. My wife was not so impressed with standard meals. On the way out we had a break in Brunei 10 hours in a hotel room and wished we could have had the same on the way back. The plane was clean and staff very attentive. The inflight entertainment was varied but screen was small and on the trip back my screen was not clear. Brunei airport is the scruffiest I have been to. There is little to do and the toilets were malfunctioning and down a long staircase. The stairs were filthy. And the schedule on the way back is a killer. 7 hours to Brunei wait for 3 hours 8 hours to Dubai wait for 1.5 hours 7 hours to LHR. And if you can't sleep it takes a week to get over. With the huge price advantage I would use them again particularly now they have a flight to Melbourne but I will probably pay to break the trip back either in Brunei or Dubai.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
BWN-DXB-LHR onboard B777-200ER an ex Singapore Airline aircraft. Seated at the window seat the window is covered with some mess - requested a hankie from a cabin crew it took ages (reminding twice) to deliver. First leg food was alright requested SFML delivered. But second leg after 1 hour stopover in DXB a new set of crew took over and they left out my requested meal. IFE broke down an hour after airborne moved my seat to the back near the toilet. Toilet never serviced as the smell was awful - a few fellow passengers did complain to the crew but no action taken. One of the crew even told us 'there is nothing we can do about it move to the front if you prefer. This is the cheapest ticket to LHR by an Asian carrier from SE Asia. but is it worth it? The aircraft is old and smelly interior was seen a decade ago although RBA advertised it as a new aircraft B777 which is not.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Late booking flew London-Auckland return. Staff first rate food is fine and no alcohol was not a problem. Leg room fine for economy. Stopover at Brunei is boring.

Excellent trip to Australia and back. Cabin crew well presented attentive and unobtrusive but there if you need them food is good and plentiful. No alcohol but a frequent round of soft drinks tea and coffee. I will certainly fly with them again. I also liked the 2 stops it broke up the long haul element.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review

Heathrow to Brisbane return. B777 was comfortable inflight entertainment good and the meals excellent. The cabin staff were courteous and attentive. We would have liked a little longer in Dubai to shop. This was our second trip to Australia using Royal Brunei and in my opinion they can't be beaten on price and service.

LHR-AKL. Only one minor delay at Brunei for a broken seatbelt that was quickly fixed. The service was excellent with friendly crew and food quite good. Didn't miss the alcohol on board - plenty of soft drink options instead. IFE system worked on all legs with a reasonable choice of movies etc.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We used the carrier on the recommendation of a friend who had flown economy and we found the experience to be below par. We flew Business class with two teenagers in economy. Their seats were what you might expect for the price (tight and cramped) but the business class seats were pretty uncomfortable too. The food and service were offhand and our sons were not allowed into business class despite there only being two other people in the entire section for the last sector. The flight was delayed leaving Heathrow the unpublicized stopover in Dubai curtailed and the Bandar Seri Begawan experience brought me back to flying 20 years ago. Not worth the pennies that we saved in retrospect. And we only found out about the lack of drinks after we had booked - don't try to bring your own despite what the airline says - they take it away from you in Bandar Seri Begawan!

Return Brisbane- London. Plane was clean found food enjoyable and the friendly cabin staff came between meals with drinks onboard entertainment was good. Having 2 short stops on the long journey (Brunei-Dubai) was one of the reasons we chose Royal Brunei - an added bonus the fares were cheaper.

Singapore to Auckland transit nearly 24 hours in Brunei. Took up the Holidays in Brunei package which included a hotel stay 2-way airport transfers. Food on flight was okay entertainment good and service from flight attendants average. We had our luggage checked-in through from Singapore to Auckland. When we arrived in Auckland we found our luggage broken into and ransacked padlock missing and some items in the luggage were either missing or broken. As we did not manage to lodge a complaint online in time (RBA accepts only complaints via email within 7 days) due to our tight schedule and sometimes we had no internet access the airline responded to say that they could not do anything for us. This is the first time we flew with them and the first time we ever lost something while flying.

Flight from London to Auckland via Dubai and Bandar Seri Begawan. Boeing 777 clean well maintained and nice to see crew cleaning the toilets regularly. Staff attentive and friendly and more than enough food and soft drinks. It was nice to break up the journey to NZ with 3 legs and I will use this airline again.

BNE-LHR via Dubai and Brunei. The IFE worked on all legs food was good (although the prawn starter seemed to have a very odd taste). I managed to purchase duty free in Dubai (sit at the front of the plane if you can then head straight to duty free after security screening buy what you need - no wandering around no time and head back to plane). The real downside is Brunei Airport - it is truly awful I had a 13 hour stop over and they put me up in hotel. Free transfers and it was clean tidy better than most actually.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Heathrow to Perth via Dubai and Brunei. Planes comfortable cabin crew very attentive toilets at Brunei Airport clean. On return journey from Perth to Brunei the Airbus seemed smaller with less leg room and was rather warm. B777 from Brunei was a bit cool but staff were very pleasant. Food was good (if you like spicy which I do) and plenty of soft drinks. Only bit I didn't like was the very quick turn round in Dubai which was like a route march up to Customs and back again!

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Heathrow-Dubai-Brunei-Perth B777 comfortable staff reasonably attentive food ok though very repetitive. Welcomed the brief walk for short time in Dubai airport exceptionally clean. Brunei a different matter - toilets almost unusable thoroughly disgusted that customers would have to use these conditions Going out we had a 13.5 hour stopover initially booked a hotel for short time but when we saw the state of the taxis outside airport changed our minds so ended up staying in the airport. Brunei to Perth was not good plane very small and the male stewards less than helpful. Our return flight with thankfully only a 2 hour visit to Brunei airport didn't use the toilet waited to get back on the plane. Will never use this airline again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland Kuala Lumpur via Brunei. Flight from Auckland to Brunei was just about empty. Staff very attentive. Hot towels before take off plenty of drinks. Meals fine. IFE was good lots on offer B777 was very roomy. Toilets were clean the staff kept them very clean. The staff did not disappear after meal service - kept the drinks flowing and service with a smile. Brunei - Kuala Lumpur much the same but the A319 had much less room no PTV. Service was excellent and attentive on this short flight.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur via Brunei. Boeing 777 to Brunei clean efficient service Economy seat good pitch friendly staff tasty lunch. Average entertainment but it sufficed. A320 to Kuala Lumpur only a 2 hour flight but nice dinner again but more cramped on this plane. Price is the winner here nearly half of other airlines.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland-Brunei-Bangkok return. The main reason for choosing Royal Brunei was that for our family of 3 children and 2 adults it save us NZD 2500 for the return fare over the next best airline deals. Compared to other airlines I've flown there was little difference to larger airlines. My in seat tv screen had problems playing movies on one of the legs but was fine on the return. They tried to reboot it but this didn't solve the problem and my son had problems with the audio on his tv screen on the return leg - again rebooting didn't help. The airport at Brunei is a little lacking in options but we wouldn't hesitate to do this again - even though the trip took longer than a direct flight from Auckland to Bangkok.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Brisbane to Singapore via Bandar Seri Begawan. In-flight service good flight attendants friendly and helpful. Inflight entertainment was alright. Meals were excellent although a little bit small in size. However the stopover wasn't the best moment - wireless internet in Brunei airport wasn't free. They expect us to purchase coffee in order to obtain the password. Also the free city tour is only available if passenger are flying to Brunei from Australia and New Zealand not from Brunei to Australia and New Zealand.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Heathrow to Auckland return via Dubai and Brunei - trip cost under £750. I am over 6' and was pleased to be able to sit in a seat with more legroom. Staff attentive the men better than the ladies to be honest. Food on the flights ranged from really excellent spiced lamb to a very poor English breakfast. Drinks frequently served and water on tap. Entertainment surprised me - 100's of music CD's several new films and a host of older films. Stopover in Dubai simple and the long walk through security welcome to be honest. Brunei airport is very old and in poor condition considering the wealth of the country - having said that it does only handle a small number of passengers. To get away from everyone sit upstairs in the tourist information room where there are comfortable tub chairs.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Brisbane to Shanghai via Brunei in Business Class and found the experience satisfactory. The seats are about 95% lie flat meals were excellent as was service and the Brunei lounge very comfortable. Unfortunately the lounge in Shanghai is shared with China Eastern which needs a new broom! From memory the fare was cheaper than other airlines and I would use the airline again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
London to Brisbane the first leg of the flight was freezing. The selection of films was pretty poor and seat back screens very small. The meals are small by comparison to Singapore Airlines or JAL and not of such a high standard. The cost of the flight was cheaper by around 150 pounds but the lack of alcohol on board and the dire ladies toilet situation in Bandar Seri Begawan mean that I would be very unlikely to use this airline again. In addition being on hold for 29mins to talk to reservation staff at the Brisbane office is also a pretty poor show. On a positive note the cabin crew were polite and helpful.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Travelled return from Auckland to London and found them to be very good. I flew on the newly leased Boeing 777 which were great. Fair amount of space good individual entertainment system and good food. Staff attentive and friendly but also relaxed.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We have just returned from Auckland. Could not fault the airline - timekeeping cleanliness of aircraft and cabin crew service outstanding inflight catering was wonderful.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Brisbane-London flight was great service the best we've had. Stops were no problem food was nice - soft drinks on tap no alcohol rule wasn't a problem. You can buy at the airport and drink onboard - staff will give you ice and mixers but once its open you can't take it through to next stop.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Travelled with family to Dubai from London. Staff were very attentive. Our travel agent forgot to inform Royal Brunei that we were vegetarian. The staff could not do enough to try and assists and had meal from business class given to us. Inflight entertainment was excellent and kept the kids busy.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Parents and teenager UK to Auckland. The staff were attentive friendly and bringing whatever was requested. The food was more than ample tasty and interesting menus with small things to pick at if it seemed the wrong time for a meal. Seats are fairly spacious although the aircraft from Brunei to Auckland is a little tighter. The only drawback to my mind is the stop at Brunei where the ladies washroom had floors awash and no flushing toilets or hand- drying facilities.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland to KL return. The price was far cheaper than any other airline and my 13yr old daughter can still travel with a childs fare. Check in easy flights on time planes fine and entertainment was working. Legroom excellent food and staff were great - even given flight packs and kids entertainment packs. Only had a short stopover in Brunei both ways but found a good coffee and free internet at the airport.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
London to Brisbane via Dubai and Brunei. More legroom than when I flew with Etihad last year friendly staff very cheap tickets. Poor selection of films no power plugs in economy service is very slow - only a 3 hour window to sleep between dinner finally being cleared before they wake you for a snack. Brunei airport is expensive with nothing to do and a dire toilet situation no alcohol.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
London to Perth via Brunei. A fair few of the in-flight entertainment systems didn't work mine included. I swapped seats on the next leg. Food fine seats a bit hard but the main complaint is the stopover in Dubai. I think two stops is a hassle - once I got to Brunei I was practically delirious with lack of sleep. I enjoyed the day tour though (took the 1.5hr tour of Brunei while in transit) and for the £500 return paid it was a bargain. There are worse airlines that Royal Brunei and I'd say Cathay and Malaysian are only a tad better. I would do it again if I found that same cheap ticket.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland to Bangkok via Brunei overnight stop. No complaints about service food etc on the flight however the ladies toilets in Brunei are unacceptable. There are only a few the line to use them went out of the toilet room and into the main airport. If I recall there were only 2 european toilets that made the waiting even longer.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I travelled back from London to Perth stopping at Dubai and Brunei in transit. No entertainment on the first 2 legs - 7 and 8 hours each so the flight was really long and laborious. The seats were too hard and with no entertainment system I really felt it. No explanation from the crew. Not good enough.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Royal Brunei Business Class Perth-LHR-Perth. All flights on time check-in smooth and quick and inflight service courteous and efficient. We thought the food was as good or better than we had received on flights with other major airlines and you could ask for it whenever you wanted it. Soft drinks were readily supplied and the TV screens worked perfectly. While the terminal at Brunei might not be exciting (it has very few shops) the Business Class lounge is comfortable quiet with an attractive range of food. While the 2 stops (Dubai and Brunei) do extend the trip duration there is an advantage in having the longest leg limited to about 8 hours before you can get out and walk about.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland to Kuala Lumpur via Brunei. Flight booked and paid for direct with RBA in February 2010. Flight schedule changed three times before departure from Auckland. RBA deny bumping us off flights. Previous experience of being bumped by RBA at Singapore makes me sceptical. Changes to return leg means I miss my 60th celebration with family and friends in Malaysia. Atrocious food on Brunei - KL leg. Will never use this airline again

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR to Brisbane return. The tv screens were not working the food was unacceptable until the last leg on the return journey Dubai to LHR when we got one good meal. The ladies toilet facilities at Brunei airport are something you do not expect from a country such as Brunei. We got stuck in Brisbane for a whole week nobody could tell us what was going to happen let alone giving us some compensation - every day we were told that there was another meeting in Brunei and nothing had been decided so there would be another meeting the next day - again with no news. After the whole experience I do not think I want to fly with them again.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland to Bangkok via Brunei and will never fly Royal Brunei again. I have read other peoples comments and they have said you only get what you pay for I disagree we didn't even get that! We are regular fliers having used many airlines but this was our first and definitely our last flight with Royal Brunei. Nothing but disappointing - while we understand language barriers and other cultural issues can sometimes cause misunderstandings there is no excuse for rudeness and staff not doing their jobs in a courteous way.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
I was one flying from Perth to the UK when the volcano ash stopped flights to Heathrow. During our enforced stopover which lasted 6 days Royal Brunei were fantastic. We were allocated rooms in the Orchid Garden Hotel and supplied regular meals for the stay. Every day there were officials that we could talk to about our concerns and most of the time they kept us well informed. We were given the opportunity to explore the city with shuttle buses to town centres. Some members of our party were disabled and were treated wonderfully with taxis laid on where they couldn't get on the buses all free of charge. We were so grateful that we had flown with Royal Brunei when we saw on the news the thousands of people sleeping in airports without the most basic of conveniences.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
My wife and I booked return tickets to Jakarta via Brunei. On 15th March the schedule was changed. Due to these changes we were to spend all day in Brunei at the Terrace Hotel. This hotel was dirty smelly with broken fixtures and fittings and was the low light of a very ordinary trip. Also on two of the planes we found faulty seats that sagged backwards to the annoyance of the people behind. Value for money - yes but you get what you pay for.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We were booked to return to London from Kota Kinabalu last Sunday. The flight was cancelled due to the Icelandic volcano which was fair enough. Although Heathrow is now open Royal Brunei Airlines seem to have no idea of how to deal with the 1000 plus stranded passengers. We have made numerous phone calls and all we get is a promise to phone back - they never do. I get the impression that they have a vague plan to send us on spare seats on scheduled flights which should get most of us back by Christmas. We are not expecting miracles all we ask is some information on how they are planning to get us home.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
My wife and I have just returned from Brisbane airport. Twice today I was contacted by phone confirming that we were on our "booked" business class flight to London. When we arrived at the airport we were told that we had been bumped off the flight. There seemed to just be random people chosen. About 8 of us were in the same boat. No taxi voucher was given for us to return home and no future booking made. Very poor public relations.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
We booked with the airline purely based on cost. 585GBP return to Auckland from London was simply too good to be true. The outbound journey was only the start. My wife managed to be allocated a seat with no working TV screen for the entire trip and given we made the journey on 2 different planes I can only assume that other screens were broken on the planes. The food was OK and they were happy to provide soft drinks throughout the flight. The stopover in Brunei was terrible. Be warned if you book a flight with an eight or nine hour stop over there is nothing to do at the airport. By nothing I mean nothing at all. The return journey still hasn't happened as the Icelandic volcano led to the closure of EU airspace and this is where Royal Brunei have really showed how much of an amateur airline they are. Since Saturday morning they have prevented any London passengers from leaving Auckland. Whilst understandable due to the changing events in Europe what isn't acceptable is the way they are handling the backlog. We were given a scrap of paper and told to call the number regularly for updates. The head of check-in took everyone's telephone number on scraps of paper - and that was it. If it wasn't so sad it would be funny but the lady involved was unaware that there was a problem before she got to work - as she had been on holiday. This is the Senior representative of the airline in New Zealand. I called their office on Monday to ask if they were keeping a record of who would be able to fly on what flight once the airspace was opened and was told they couldn't as the 4 points on the journey were all working independently - incredible. So when Heathrow was opened rather than the airline being able to give you a flight that you would be on you are left in limbo and having to call in 3 or 4 times a day only to be told that they still can't give you an assured flight date and time. Whilst I understand delays and cancellations were unavoidable I find it incredible that the stranded passengers at each point were never collated into a delayed manifest/passenger list and therefore an exact answer could be given once the restrictions were lifted. The upshot of this is that a number of very upset and angry passengers were told that even though Heathrow was open no London bound passengers would be allowed on the first flight out of Auckland on the first flight and that 2 days later cannot give a definitive answer to the question - "when will I be flying". As an upshot of this mismanagement and total lack of proactive communication my wife has had to stay in Auckland whilst I have simply decided to stay here and lose my flight. So if you are thinking of booking a flight with Royal Brunei remember that you are essentially letting yourself in for an uncomfortable and sometimes unpleasant experience with friendly inflight staff but very little in the way of support if something goes wrong. In my opinion I wish I had paid twice as much and flown with a bigger airline.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Check in at Heathrow was smooth and efficient aircraft comfortable and very clean. Food was plentiful. The non alcohol policy wasn't a problem especially when you are allowed to take your own. We had our own TV screen - perhaps the choice of films wasn't the best but it was adequate. All crew were smart extremely courteous and very helpful.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Fourth long haul flight (Perth WA) I have done with Royal Brunei in the last six months and I have to comment on the deterioration of the food. Overall it was poor and I found the snacks inedible. Another disappointing experience is the ladies toilet in the transit terminal at Brunei airport - far from international standard. Very unpleasant. The cabin crew were efficient and friendly and I was grateful not to be charged extra for my slightly overweight baggage. Whilst I think the airline probably gives value for money I would rather pay a little more for a decent meal and an acceptable ladies toilet.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
LHR-BWN (via DXB). Disappointed with all 4 sectors. Aging 767-300's are really showing their age. Seat pitch ok and food served acceptable but a poor choice of beverages and little imagination given that Royal Brunei are a dry airline. Seatback TV's 60% not working in all sectors and very poor choice of films and TV choices when working. Most passengers were travelling onto NZ with 2 more stops after Brunei - would never contemplate choosing Royal Brueni to travel all the way to Australia or New Zealand. There are far better airlines in the Asia Pacific region and Royal Brunei needs to upgrade to compete with its neighbours.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Business Class Perth-Brunei-Dubai-Heathrow. Check-in quick and easy apart from the usual slow pass through security followed by a calm wait in the Malaysian Airlines lounge which Royal Brunei use. All flights on schedule. Meals could be ordered on demand were as good or better than we have had on other airlines. The space between seats on the B767 Brunei to London was excellent and reclined sufficiently for reasonable comfort. However we would have liked the leg rests to rise to a more horizontal position. A320 Perth to Brunei was satisfactory. Business Class lounge in the modern Brunei terminal pleasant and offered a range of nibbles and non-alcoholic drinks. We did buy a small bottle of spirits in Perth Duty Free and were supplied with a suitable bottles of soft drink mixers on the plane. And while you can take the remains with you if you dis-embark in Brunei you can't bring it back on. You can purchase Duty Free wine and spirits in Dubai very cheaply and these are allowed back on the plane as are Duty Free purchases in other airports. There were no individual TV screens in the plane we flew movies were shown on a large screen in the front of the business class cabin.

### Royal Brunei Airlines customer review
Auckland to Brunei. Auckland airport is not passenger friendly at 3am and not well set up for such early flights. If like me you are conditioned to check in at least two hours before the flight you will have a long wait in the check-in area before you can go airside. There is not much seating and what there is is largely occupied by sleeping passengers who have got to the airport on the last cheap transport from the city the previous night and who sleep across three or four of the available seats. Immigration and security open one hour before scheduled boarding and Qantas Business Class Lounge at 4am thirty minutes before boarding call. I did not see the other lounges open at all but did not check this out. Immigration and security lines moved fast so if you are flying business class I would recommend not checking in much before 45 minutes before departure or better still take the noon departure even if it means a couple of hours extra journey time for the Brisbane stopover. Maybe others were aware of the early departure discomforts. The business class cabin was only half full. Cabin service on the AKL-BWN the best. Arrival procedures for Business Passengers in Brunei is rapid and I was in my hotel fifty minutes after touchdown.
