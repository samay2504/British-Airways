### “absence of customer care”
Not Verified | Kuwait Airways Failure to Support in a Time of Crisis. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of responsiveness and empathy shown by Kuwait Airways regarding my situation. Despite several attempts to reach out (Whatsapp, Email, Twitter), I have been ignored, leaving me with a deep sense of frustration and anger. I had requested a refund or even a gesture of goodwill for the return tickets of my wife and four children, who had to urgently return home due to a critical health issue involving a close member of my family. While I fully understand that the tickets were non-refundable, the exceptional circumstances called for at least some level of understanding and humanity. Furthermore, I requested to use one of the unused tickets for additional luggage on my own return trip to France. Once again, I was met with a refusal, despite the ongoing emergency and the considerable cost I’ve already incurred. The lack of response and the absence of customer care from Kuwait Airways has been shocking, especially from a company that claims to prioritize its customers. Such behavior only damages your reputation and pushes loyal customers to reconsider ever flying with Kuwait Airways again. I hope this public post serves as a reminder that when a company fails to show empathy and support during difficult times, it affects not only individual experiences but also the brand’s image globally.

### "disappointing and frustrating"
I must say, the experience was disappointing and frustrating. Initially, we were scheduled to return on August 16th, but our flight was unexpectedly canceled and rescheduled for August 23rd from Beirut to Bahrain via Kuwait. To make matters worse, that second flight was also canceled, leaving us in a difficult position and with no immediate solution for our travel plans. One of the most frustrating aspects of this ordeal was the airline’s handling of our refund. Since I purchased my ticket through a travel agent, Kuwait Airways has taken an exorbitant amount of time to process the refund. It's been incredibly disheartening to see other travelers online receive timely refunds for similar situations while I’m left waiting without clear communication or support. Adding to my frustration, I had reached out to Kuwait Airways on August 1st, inquiring about the last available flight from Beirut (August 4th) due to security concerns. I was informed that the flight was full, which led us to explore alternatives. However, a friend later shared a video showing that the flight was, in fact, half full. This lack of transparency and coordination raises questions about the airline's communication practices and customer service. Given the multiple flight cancellations, delayed refund process, and the inconsistent information provided by the airline, I can’t help but feel let down by Kuwait Airways. Travel can be stressful enough without having to navigate such issues. While I understand that cancellations can happen for various reasons, the lack of support and clarity has made this experience far from satisfactory. In conclusion, I would advise potential travelers to think carefully before booking with Kuwait Airways, especially if you're reliant on timely travel and customer service. In our case this has caused us to buy other tickets by a different airlines which has incurred an extra cost on us. My experience has left me hesitant to fly with them in the future.

### “FA not prepared to offer any assistance”
In the middle of the trip, I experienced very bad headache and a sudden loss of consciousness. My husband asked for assistance but despite the urgency of the situation, the FA who attended to me was not prepared to offer any assistance. He was just there watching me. Fortunately, one co-passenger was very kind to assist me until I felt better and until we left the aircraft. About the situation, I email the airline 2x to file a complaint but till now I didn't receive any feedback from them.

### “faced very rude behavior from cabin crew”
I have faced very rude behavior from cabin crew from Kuwait to Cochin flight on 07/4/24 at 2330 hrs. Since I was traveling with my 2-year-old son, the air hostess insisted I keep the child on the seat but the child was crying so I requested the attachments to keep the baby on my lap, she was quite unhappy and brought that belt and just threw it at my seat. The rest of the flight journey was nice and comfortable.

### "No compensation was given"
Kuwait Airways is by far the worst airline. They have no customer support. I travelled to Munich in October and when I landed at Munich, my baggage hadn't arrived, to which I complained and there was not a single center that entertained Kuwait Airways for lost baggage. I filled the Property Irregularity Report and handed it to the AHS at Munich Airport and notified Kuwait Airways of my lost baggage online through their email, their website contact as well as their WhatsApp, but I received no reply. After 8 days, I received one of the two bags at my residence in Munich, and 10 days after that, I received my second bag which (was new) had its zips broken, locks broken, the bag was a mess inside with the inner shielding broken. I had initially complained for lost baggage and then I applied for compensation for delayed and damaged baggage. My constant messages and emails were ignored by their customer relations department. No compensation was given.

### "won’t be flying with Kuwait Airways again"
Our first flight from London-Kuwait-Dhaka was okay, coming back we had 46kg (23kg x2). Dhaka to Kuwait was extremely stressful, we had under packed 5/6 suitcases and 1 was 4kg over the 23kg limit. As there was 3 of us, we just assumed that as we were under the 138kg limit, it would be okay if one suitcase was over. As in most Airlines they allow this. The staff at the check in desk were extremely patronising and rude, they were sniggering at us. And insisting we should pay £95 or they (staff) will have to pay the fine. The suitcase that was over, was broken thus we didn’t want to reopen it and decrease the weight. The rule for 23kg each suitcase is extremely stupid as from London-Kuwait-Dhaka the baggage allowance was one suitcase as 32kg. So it’s not the matter for heavy handling. We were under our weight limit and they were asking for money. In addition our flight is currently being delayed and we do not know when we will be able to fly. So we won’t be flying with Kuwait Airways again, and I will not recommend to others to do so.

### "a good quality service"
Not Verified | As a frequent flyer on the Kuwait Airways I would recommend it on there large aircrafts such as B777-300er, A330-800neo or A330-200, and specially on business class even though it is expensive but you will get a good quality service. My rating would be on there business, first and royal class And I have also uploaded a photo of B777-300er business seat

### "prolonged and distressing experience"
Not Verified |  Our original flight from Kuwait to Bangkok on August 12,2023. The original flight was first delayed by an hour and a half. However, within 45 minutes of taking off, the captain announced technical difficulties and we returned to Kuwait Airport. When we landed in Kuwait Airport, we remained there for at least 10 hours without any formal information about the rescheduling of our flight. We enquired multiple times but the staff were unable to provide any helpful information about our next departure. The situation was very poorly handled and the staff were, at times, intimidating towards passengers who were simply exhausted and looking for information to determine their onward travel plans. The staff said that they would provide us with food and water during our wait, however, this took at least 7 hours to reach us. We eventually arrived in Bangkok at least 13 hours later than expected. Overall, it was a prolonged and distressing experience and below the standard of what we would expect from Kuwait Airways.

### "Poor customer Service"
Poor customer Service in flight. For food, There was only lamb available - no chicken and not even veg. But most irritating was that they were not apologetic and did not even serve me the tray which has got salad and dessert etc. Totally ignored me. I had to ask again for the other stuff to be served to me

### "I really enjoyed the service"
I really enjoyed the service provided helpful, friendly and assertive cabin crew on all four flights. Also the ground staff were also helpful. The food was really nice on board and i had loads of free drinks. I had managed to use the online portal with ease. Will definitely recommend and fly again with KA.

### "extremely disappointed with the service"
Not Verified |  I travelled from Rome to Kuwait. I am extremely disappointed with the service offered. I had ordered for Non veg Hindu meal (while ticket booking) but was given rice with spinach (vegetarian). I told the cabin crew to give me what I ordered. She said we have to eat what is offered and if there is any extra plate after giving to other passengers, only then she will be able to give me any non-vegetarian plate. Another cabin crew said they don't have extra, to which I said we don't want any food. After reminder the cabin crew, she said only chicken with potatoes was available, so we accepted that. Kuwait airways is not a budget airline. They made a mistake by not giving us the meal we ordered and also made us wait for food. There was no bottle of water offered. The flight staff need to know hospitality or they are in the wrong profession.

### "bring me some water and wash the bottle"
Very unprofessional and rude cabin crew. I was traveling with my 18 months daughter. I asked cabin crew can you please bring me some water for milk and wash the bottle. She said it's not my job. I was also asking do you have any baby food, she said you should bring your baby food.

### "will never fly Kuwait Air again"
Worst airline experience I ever had. The plane was good and had good legroom and overall temperature. The horror started when we landed in New York and 300 bags did not arrive. I have filed the complaint but went to Canada the next day for a business trip. I received only one check in luggage out of the 2 which only contained shoes. I had to call the airline everyday to get any progress with my bag and everyday they tell me it already arrived but it was impossible to find a way to bring it to Canada. All these calls had to be done thru international calling and I had to start buying clothes and toiletries for the trip. 10 days later my bag arrived in Canada and I asked if from the JFK office, they can offer any upgrade for what happened. They said yes and I tried to confirm with the check in counter if I got upgraded to premium economy or at least forward seats and she said yes and I wont have anyone beside me. When I board the plane, I was give seats at the last possible row beside the toilet and beside many people. They fixed it but I felt very disrespected with how it went. Right after receiving my bag I filed a formal complaint letter with receipts of all my interim purchases, I only got 1 reply from the Dubai office and they told me to send it to customer relations. Now one month later and a lot of calls later, no reply from customer relations. only the office staff are responding to calls and they have been helpless about the matter. Safe to say I will never fly Kuwait Air again and according to the NYC office the plane had temperature issues which is why they didn't put the bags in. Why did they even let the airplane fly with onboard guest if it had issues so bad that they couldn't handle all our luggage?

### "flight was delayed by many hours"
We took Kuwait airways to Manila for our sins. On the way to Manila our flight was delayed by many hours. On the return home, we had a nice 7 hour delay in Kuwait airport. However we then saw our original flight was leaving on time and that we had been kicked off due to over booking. No one explained why we were kicked off having booked our tickets months ago. Only flown with Kuwait twice now and both times have lead to many many hours waiting around an airport. We also missed a connecting flight we had booked from Manilla because of this but of course there is no compensation for this.

### "this is a company without shame"
Turned back to Kuwait after 30min heading towards BKK. No communication and kept passengers in the dark. Once deplaned, again no communication. All waited around, then an Employee said there will be a plane next day 8.30am, which was confirmed by the receptionist in the business lounge. I am still waiting at the gate and it is 10.00 am the next day, and still nothing. You guessed it, again still no communication. But Passengers were told one thing, there is no pilot. Obviously this is a company without shame. Will never fly Kuwait airways again ever.

### "delayed almost 4 hours"
Not Verified | Bad experience to travel with Kuwait Airways KU331 with my new born baby, we had paid a huge amount of 600 KWD for 3 person to book one way ticket to TRV. For our baby I paid 76 KWD. We choose bassinet seats and it was extremely dirty and dusty, our baby bassinet was dirty inside and and whole cabinet was not properly arranged in the airline. The flight was delayed almost 4 hours from Kuwait, flight was very dirty. I never recommend anyone to travel with family with Kuwait Airways. Bad experience.

### "selected seat was occupied"
Not Verified | The flight from Milan to Kuwait was ok, I had the emergency seat and sat comfortably, the nightmare started during the layover. The flight got delayed for 2 hours, the boarding process was so rushed and was very chaotic. When I got inside the plane, my selected seat was occupied and the flight attendant put me in a middle seat. I'm tall 6.3 and imagine how uncomfortable I was. Food was fine, nothing special, if you order special meal, specify two different kind of type of meal, or else you'll get the same thing for both leg. My IFE was not working most of the time and the staff was not able to fix it.

### "didn't have full flat seats"
I was supposed to fly from Istanbul but changed to Vienna and was charged around 680€ extra for the change. To my shock they used much smaller plane than from Istanbul and I didn't have full flat seats on this 4hr 15mins flight. I find it very unprofessional to deny comfort of full reclining seats on flights from Europe to GCC especially when one is requested to pay higher price. Using bus instead of the bridge was another unpleasant surprise. I arrived on time for boarding and had to sit for 50 minutes because as is often the case with busses everything was delayed. In Vienna airport they packed us like sardines, and bus didn't move for 25 minutes. = Upon arrival to Kuwait there was once again a bus while 90% of the bridges were empty. Thus is the first and the last time I'm using Kuwait Airways! I have no complaints about cabin crew, they tried their best, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to make my comfortable.

### "their food is just perfect"
It was on time exactly, 0% delays. The crew were kind, the food was delicious. One thing everyone must know about Kuwait airways, their food is just perfect. The seat was good, neat and comfortable, legroom is normal. While the plane Interior lights were just amazing blue and red LED lights. To be honest the only bad thing about this airline is the price you pay, which is too high. Everything else in my opinion is perfect.

### "a 6 hour delay of the flight"
There was a 6 hour delay of the flight initially. From 1:45 am it was changed to 7:15 am. I was at the airport from 9 pm the previous night until they announced the boarding call at 7:00 am. The boarding time was suppose to be at 6:15 am. Another hour late. We were sleepy, hungry and thirsty. The airways didn't even provide any provisions for the affected passengers. To make the situation even worse was, that our connecting flight to our destination had been affected. They didn't offer any compensation for the tickets we had lost due to the flight changes. Time check as of this moment 7:40 and they are still boarding passengers.

### "airline doesn’t have any general standards"
This was the first time I have traveled with Kuwait Airways and I hope this would be the last time. This airline doesn’t have any general standards. I have travelled other airlines that are much better quality. 1st thing to start with is flight entertainment, I have travelled 6 hours and 5.5 hours with 1 hour transit. They don’t have entertainment facilities on their screen. 5-4 movies and no games, no music, no kid’s entertainment. No pillow given, so you can’t even rest or take a nap! Seating facilities are poor, seats are worse than easyJet or Wizz Air. Not comfortable and not enough space! Cabin Crews are shouting at everyone, press your button to call and they don’t bother to show up. Not helpful. Toilets are not equipped, small and smelly, they don’t clean. Food quality is cheap and poor, I had lasagne which was like rubber my Mrs had chicken with rice! And finally drinks are limited, they don’t serve alcohol! Only Pepsi, cheap mango and orange juice. Airport was small and our transits were short so could not see the transit area.

### "plane was way too cold"
Friendly staff, tasty food, comfortable seats and I got moved to a seat with more legroom on own request. Plane left on time. The plane was way too cold, the blankets they provided also didn't help that much. Very unpleasant experience. Small movie selection

### "one of the most helpful airlines"
Kuwait Airways is one of the most helpful airlines I have ever used. My elderly father (who uses a walking stick) frequently travels between Milan Malpensa and Kuwait and is treated with the utmost respect and care every time he travels. Mrs Contento and her team are the most helpful airport staff I have ever met. She makes sure that he arrives at the gate on time and has brought him water. She even makes sure he gets an easily accessible seat so that he doesn’t have to walk too far through the airplane. Honestly, this is a 5 star service and I cannot recommend Kuwait Airways enough. Kuwait Airways MXP staff are the best. Thank you very much.

### "not reliable in terms of punctuality"
3.5 hours delay added to the waiting time (7 hours at the airport) made my journey with Kuwait airways a hectic one! I’m sorry to conclude that Kuwait Airways is not reliable in terms of punctuality.

### "Business class service bad"
Business class service bad from start to end. Two meals only for 13h flight with non edible snacks in between, staff with visible attitude,  no amenity kits, lounge with horrible choice of food and drinks. Lost luggage handled disastrously. Customer service just gives you phone numbers to call in the US and says: "I cannot do nothing I try help you" On the positive note, seats are comfy to sleep and given the service the best thing to do on-board is indeed to sleep.

### "attempt to reverse it within 30 minutes"
I booked a flight from Kuwait to Doha on 25 Dec, long after the world cup had ended but upon checking I realise I need a world cup ticket to enter Doha so I proceed immediately within 30 minutes to call and cancel the flight. I tried everything - Facebook, Twitter to no avail. I even called their Kuwait Office from my Singapore phone number and they said I have to call a local office. I told them I am from Singapore, there is o base here, she basically shrugs it off and implied it is not her problem. They pocketed $300+ in total for absolutely free! This is no fault of mine and i attempt to reverse it within 30 minutes.

### "no wheelchair available"
Not Verified | London to Kuwait via Islamabad. Our flight was cancelled because of bad weather, and Kuwait airways offered us a hotel in Islamabad. Our flight was from Islamabad to Kuwait 2-hour stay and then London Heathrow. We got a flight the next day from Islamabad to Kuwait with 3-hour stay then from Kuwait to Paris, not London and the Stay in Paris was 8 hours. They refuse to offer any hotel. I am a disabled person I asked for help, but they refused. I asked for a wheelchair there was no wheelchair available at Paris airport. We were travelling with kids airport staff didn't even let kids in the play area. Very bad experience with Kuwait airways. After 4 days I am still unable to walk because of 8 hours stay at Paris airport. I am going to say thanks Kuwait airways for a few hour's stay in Pc hotel Rawalpindi.

### "the worst service provider"
Travelled with kids from Islamabad to Kuwait on the 31st August on Flight Number KU206. One of the worst service provider ever. No blankets, worst food. Staff on the plain were just rude and strange, no smile on their faces. They refused to provide blankets for even my kids, one of the air hostesses said ”we don’t have enough blankets“. On the name of Breakfast there were boiled chickpeas with some sort of potatoes which I returned. Kuwait Airways really need to work on it and needs to improve their service.

### "Absolutely terrible service"
Not Verified |  Never flying Kuwait Airways again. Absolutely terrible service and staff. For a 12 hour flight, we received our first meal and then nothing again for 10 hours. If you want a drink or snack you have to go to the back and ask for it and even then we were refused several times saying we’ll get coffee later, or there’s no more snacks , and just plain “no” when asking for a soda. The staff are rude and attitude written all over their face. Food on the flight is also horrible. Also entertainment on the screens were very very limited.

### "worst airline one could ever choose"
This is the worst airline one could ever choose to fly with. Going and coming back they lost our luggage and no one can help in finding them. Completely ruined our vacation we worked so hard towards. Never again

### "used the call bell but no one coming"
I usually enjoy to fly with Kuwait airways. However, in this occasion the cabin crew left me with tray of food for over an hour. I used the call bell but no one coming and all I can see them at the back chatting. I have rung the bell for the second time and yet no one came. Accidentally, one of the crew pass by my seat and ask him if he can remove the empty tray. I also told them i have been calling them for sometime but no one respond.

### "Lousy, irresponsible crew"
Not Verified |  Recently travelled from Kuwait  to Thiruvananthapuram on 24 February 2022. IFE not working. It will work for sometime and automatically shut down. Lousy, irresponsible crew with no idea of about what is meant by inflight service to be provided to passengers. Asked for water multiple times, but none of the crew members responded. We were sitting in row 26. By the time inflight food service reached us, they said only Veg option available whereas our preference was non-Veg. When enquired they said it is over? Later when I was using the rest room, I saw the cabin crew enjoying the inflight meal in their station which was non-Veg. Do they think their choice comes first before passenger choice? When I was trying to put by luggage in cabin luggage area, the area was fully occupied by blankets meant for passengers? No blankets were included in the seat and this needs to be requested?

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Worst airline I have ever flown. Kuwait airport transit lounge does not have facility to lie down to have rest although recliner are provided which are very old & poor condition. New York flight was long but air crew was reluctant to provide extra water even did not respond to call attendance,

### "the most uncomfortable seats"
It started with the worst check in I have ever experienced. The check in did last over 3 hours and I barely missed my flight. They told me something is wrong with my papers but they could not explain what, it is just that for the airline it would be fine but the airport in Kuwait requires something. They charged me another 50$ to sort things out. The flight was disappointing too, despite sitting in the "Premium" class the seats where the most uncomfortable seats I ever sat in an airplane. I honestly thought the times of aircraft food are over. Here you get the nostalgia of survival kit like sausages and a tasteless bun with nothing more than butter, the yogurt comes plain too. Staff was nice. A lot nicer that the ground staff in Mumbai. But don't expect them to walk the extra mile. Blankets (on a night flight) are only given by request. Than they wake you up way to early just to show you a movie how amazing Kuwait is with Ferraris and Guccis. I took my time to look through the movies which offers right about what you would expect by now. It could be worse but I would rather play on my phone and write this review. At least the flight was cheaper than most, so I did not expect too much. On the other hand they even managed that I feel like I overpaid for what I got.

### "Nothing about my request for the refund"
I am a Chinese citizen living in Bahrain and I was travelling from Bahrain to Bangkok in February in 2020. When my trip ended and time to return to Bahrain, I was refused to board the airplane just because of my nationality. At that time Kuwait government banned Chinese citizens from entering Kuwait due to corona-virus pandemic, which i totally understand. But Kuwait government did not mention anything regarding transit passenger. Besides, I hadn't travelled to China since August 2019, and I had been living in Bahrain since the pandemic began. When the airline refused my trip they mentioned it was a rule from the Kuwait government and they could not provide another trip with another airline to me. So I was abandoned by them, stranded in Bangkok with nowhere to go for a night, and had to buy another ticket to return to Bahrain. Since then I tried to request a refund and an apology, but they only replied once to my email saying the ticket can be rebooked with normal rebooking policy and charges may apply. Nothing about my request for the refund and apology ever since. They do not have a international call center so it is impossible to call them directly when you are not in Kuwait.

### "One of the worst airlines"
Paris to Delhi via Kuwait. One of the worst airlines I have ever traveled with. CDG-KWI sector went fine and uneventful. But at KWI airport not a single soul to guide us to the next boarding gate. The change the gates without notice. When enquired with the staff, i was literally shooed away. Pathetic in-flight service. Forget food, I kept on requesting them for a glass of water and they did not even have to courtesy to get me that. They had the seatbelt sign on the whole time to prevent people from getting up. The return flight was way worse. They cancelled the DEL-KWI flight and put us in a hotel after people started complaining. We had by then stood in the queue for almost 3 hours. Next morning they hurdled us away from the airport at 0600 hrs saying we will have an early morning flight. The flight came at 3 pm, and we were made to sit near the boarding gates for the entire time. Again no food no water. At KWI, there was no one around to let us know anything about our next flight. We (passengers headed to US/Canada/EU) headed to the transit desk to ask and were then informed that KWI has cancelled all their flights and we will fly by Lufthansa the next morning.

### "a good experience"
Colombo to Jeddah via Kuwait. It was on time. Cabin crew is friendly and responsive. KWI to CMB my screen was not functioning. Better to add some new good films to the system. Overall, It was a good experience.

### "nice meals, nice staff"
Not Verified | Rome to Kuwait City. After reading all those low review votes I was pretty nervous but I just want to let people know that I was really glad to fly with them nice meals, nice staff, I had a really wonderful flight with them.

### "disinterested, unfriendly crew"
This was a short journey from Qatar to Kuwait and my first time flying Kuwait Airways - left Doha about 5min early and landed in KWI some 20min ahead of schedule. A friendly and warm welcome from the lady (I guess she was the Inflight manager) at the aircraft door and that was where all the pleasantries or smiles ended! The other flight attendants positioned throughout the cabin, looked surly and and greeted 3 of them as I walked to my seat at the end of the aircraft - not a single one acknowledged my “hello, good morning”. The end of the safety video was still playing as we entered the runway for takeoff. Naturally, the cabin crew were not checking seat belts were fastened and seats were up. As for the service, a snack box was offered but neither myself nor a man seating opposite me received it. When the miserable and unprofessional looking crew were collecting the empty boxes, the man seating on the opposite aisle seat to me asked one of the cabin crew if he could please have a snack box as he never got one. With an eye roll and a sigh, the crew member went to the galley and brought the man a box - all this without a word to the passenger, never mind an apology. The kind man on the aisle opposite to me (not travelling with me) even mentioned to the same attendant I had not received a snack box either, however the crew member glanced at me and went back to the galley. I do fly for work about a month ago and I cannot remember flying with such a disinterested, unfriendly crew. I was so thankful it was only a 1-hour flight. I will ask my company never to book me with Kuwait Airways again!

### "Enjoyed my trip"
London to Kuwait. Enjoyed my trip, specially my kids they liked the entertainment, food, cabin crew service was fantastic and I was amazed from the takeoff and landing very smooth. Will definitely fly again during summer vacation.

### "a shame I wasted my money on such a poor product"
Kuwait to Bangkok. Airline is a joke! First class lounge in the exclusive Kuwait Airways terminal is about 60 sqm^2. Food is extremely limited and not much to do before the flight. I was waiting for priority boarding but economy and first class were boarding together in my experience. Wi-Fi did not work for me throughout the flight, in-flight map did not work, no amenity kit, no chauffeur service, and overall seat was uncomfortable. Even the pillow is a joke for first class cabin. Not really sure how people fly this airline but I definitely would be happy making a stop at a near-by country with 5* service as opposed to flying direct with Kuwait Airways. It's a shame I wasted my money on such a poor product.

### "avoid this airline"
I paid full fare first class for this ticket from Bangkok - Kuwait, after hearing positive reviews from my colleagues at work. I'm shocked and feel stupid for paying first class to Kuwait Airways (as opposed to Emirates.) There is no Chauffeur service for Royal class (not in Kuwait nor Bangkok,) no amenity kit on this long-haul flight (almost 8 hours,) Wi-Fi did not work on my phone, no pyjamas, and the flight map did not work. No hot chocolate provided in Royal class. I found the seat to be uncomfortable. I'm only giving this airline 4/10 score since the crew (both ground and cabin) was good. As a first class passenger I strongly recommend you avoid this airline. Look for another airline if you want to have good experience.

### "missing from my hand carry baggage"
I took Kuwait Airways from London to Dhaka which had a 1 hour transit in Kuwait. I always have my hand carry baggage with me everywhere I go and I never let it out of sight but right before we boarded the plane from Kuwait to Dhaka, the staff forced me and some other passengers to hand over our hand carry baggage saying that there is no space in the aircraft. They said they would keep it with the other baggage and promised to take the responsibility. I had things in my hand carry baggage. One passenger was unwilling to hand over his hand carry baggage and staffs of this airline was behaving extremely aggressively towards that man and told us all that we have no other option but to hand over our hand carry baggage because the plane was full. Later when I reached Dhaka and checked all my bags, things were missing from my hand carry baggage. This would have never ever happened if my hand carry baggage was with me all the time. When I emailed the Airline telling them my story and demanding compensation, they wrote 'KAC is not liable for valuable items and, as per the rules and conditions that mentioned in the ticket that the passengers shall not include the valuable items and hand carry baggage is passenger own responsibility. I only carry important things in the hand carry baggage because I never let it out of my sight. This was the first time my bag was taken from me, the first time I lost anything while travelling and definitely the last time I will ever book a flight with this airline.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Kuwait to Istanbul. The best experience, it was in time and the trip progressed smoothly. They have the best leg room, the food serivce was abundant. The crew were helpful and accommodating to passenger requests.

### "not recommended at all"
Delhi to Paris via Kuwait. A320 was not comfortable while Boeing 777 was comfortable but the airport layover at Kuwait was really negative experience. Washrooms are filthy and behaviour of security staff is rude and they are disorganized. Overall the environment is cold on the airport seems like a shut down shopping mall and layover is not recommended. You can opt for this airline if they are not transiting through Kuwait otherwise not recommended at all.

### "good experience"
Kochi to Kuwait. Good and very attentive ground staff. They drop the business class passengers personally to the immigration after check. The flight was on time. Overall good experience with Kuwait Airways again. Looking forward to fly with them again.

### "experience was very good"
Kuwait to Kochi. The aircraft was not too old or may be a new one. The flight departed on time from the Kuwait Airways dedicated new terminal no: 4. Cabin crew was very attentive, Food & Beverage good. In business class the seat was not flat bed. Overall flight experience was very good but the ground services was very poor.

### "very comfortable flight"
Kuwait to Bangkok. It was a very comfortable flight. The flight was on time,aircraft was almost new. Cabin crew was ok attentive, food & beverage above average though no alcoholic beverage available. The toilets were not that clean. The seat, leg room was ok. Would fly again with Kuwait airways.

### "Shame on you Kuwait Airways"
Not Verified |  Munich to Manila via Kuwait. Worst airline ever! Once arriving in Kuwait from Germany we found out that the flight was delayed by three hours. We asked what our rights are since we will miss our connection flight in Manila. They said no rights since it’s not booked all on one ticket under their name. They said sorry but moved on. We than booked a new ticket for 100€ each. Unbelievable this service. After a longer discussion we were offered a hotel since our normally 5 hours stopover would have been 8. we were picked up at the hotel 1.5 hours before the new departure time. At the Airport we were waiting again until the newly scheduled time passed again. No announcement nothing. Hundreds of people waiting without news. Than they suddenly announced again a delay of 2 hours. Our newly bought connection ticket expired again. They said we are sorry but that’s the rules and regulations. Unbelievable really, they said to book again on our costs and than again they delayed it and we had to book a second time on our costs. We got offered nothing. When we complained they were so rude to us. And we should be quiet if we don’t want trouble with airport security. This was definitely my last flight with them. Shame on you Kuwait Airways.

### "disappointed with staff in Delhi"
Delhi to Kuwait. I am very disappointed with staff in Delhi, they gave us a lot of trouble and made us wait unnecessarily saying that they do not know about the e-visa of Pakistan and saying that it's their first time flying that route. Hope it can be sorted out because this was my first time on the airline and its leaving me with a bad impression. Thanks

### "seats are uncomfortable"
Not Verified | Lahore to Istanbul via Kuwait. Aircraft seats are uncomfortable. It was unclean. The service was not helpful and the meal not good.

### "they were fantastic"
Not Verified | London to Manila via Kuwait. I was very nervous after reading the reviews on here. However I have to say they were fantastic. The other passengers were a nightmare and I can see why the staff get the hump. The way they were treated was criminal.

### "It was chaos"
They lie. Having flown a few times with Kuwait Airways, I deliberately booked the back four seats as they are most suitable for my family of four. As we were boarding the plane we were advised the seats were 'broken' and moved to the front. It was chaos, children throwing food, kicking the seats in front and next to me, parents ignoring or sat in business class and nanniess had no control over the kids, even standing up on the seats during take off and landing. I went to look at our broken seats and all were being slept on by other passengers. Will never fly them again. Avoid. Transfer through KWI is unfriendly, airport has nothing to offer. On board wifi is very expensive comparatively to other airlines.

### "just do not want my money"
Not Verified |  London to Kuwait via Bangkok. They emailed me a change of flight. The rescheduled flight took off from Kuwait three hours before I landed there. The seats on the plane were very comfortable so I decided to fly with them again. They have turned down three attempts to purchase two tickets online with three different credit cards which work everywhere else. I called their main office in Kuwait "We cannot help you or sell you tickets. Send an email". I sent two emails, one to Kuwait Airways and one to OASIS membership. Kuwait Airlines told me to phone the Kuwait office. OASIS memmbership told me to phone the Kuwait office or email Kuwait Airlines. Never met a company before who just do not want my money.

### "It was a good experience"
I flew to Malaga from Manila, with a stop-over at Kuwait with my wife and 2 year old son. It was a good experience. The attendants were very kind, the flights were on time and smooth, and all our bags were in tact. Also, our flight was affordable. I would fly this airline again and would recommend it to others.

### "never recommend this airline"
Kuwait to Munich. Once I got inside I thought I was going get a cool touchscreen remote like Business and First Class. But turns out it was only First and Business Class that got the remote. But we got a touchscreen like Oman Air. I sat in the middle and the legroom was fine. But the space was horrible. The flight was 5 hours long I spent half of my time watching movies and half of my time sleeping. I will never recommend this airline.

### "I had an awful experience"
London to Colombo via Kuwait. I had an awful experience flying with KU. Both flights to Colombo via Kuwait City and back to London were delayed, which meant missing my onward connections in Colombo and Kuwait (from Delhi). Got no sympathy nor assistance from KU staff at the very poor Kuwait airport. I ended up re-booking my flight at my own expense in Colombo and being rerouted through Cairo to get to London, which added 7 hours to my journey. I received no apology nor compensation from any KU staff. Their customer service was so poor ,with an attitude of passing the buck, just to get rid of you. Twice,I was promised to be met and assisted at the gate, nothing materialized. This airline must be avoided at any cost, Their staff are poorly trained in dealing with delayed flights and service recovery. As a delayed passenger, you are helpless and can't access Kuwait Airways customer service managers because they don't answer their phones. Anything less than a star in your rating?

### "barely have any complaints"
Bangkok to Rome via Kuwait City. First time travelling with Kuwait Airways and barely have any complaints. Luggage drop/check in fast and smooth, normal (not incredibly organized) boarding. When it comes to the flights, much more leg space than what you usually get on other aircraft and everything was new. Big screen , not the widest western movie selection but you may find 4/5 movies that you'd like to watch. Food more than decent (good salmon quiche also), plentiful and fruit and veggie tasted fresh. Kind -and really pretty hostesses,I'm a girl and can add that on top! Only given a blanket, face mask and headcuffs. No problem with the luggages. The airport in Kuwait deserves mention: free wifi and free lounge with the comfiest recliner chairs and snacks  for economy travelers. Add on top of this (and actually in the first place) a really competitive fare! Would gladly choose again!

### "staff is insensitive"
Delhi to London via Kuwait. The staff is insensitive to the needs of the passengers. My flight from Delhi to Kuwait got delayed and consequently I missed my Kuwait to London flight. I had already made reservations in London for that day but could not avail them. They booked me on night flight to London which meant that I had to stay in Kuwait for about 7-8 hours.

### "disturbed by insensitive attitude"
Flight got delayed at Delhi. Subsequently flight which we supposed to catch in Kuwait, missed and Kuwait Airways allocated different flight which made us to wait at Kuwait airport for 4 hrs approx. We expect some refreshments from Kuwait Airways to mitigate the effects of late hours, we are traveling with whole family and badly disturbed by the insensitive attitude of Kuwait Airways. Crew is good and need more training to get accustomed to different culture customer.

### "Be prepared for nasty surprises"
Kuwait Airways experiment, my first and not a preferred one for another trip. There are few positives throughout the journey, but more negative aspects, will make me think twice before choosing this career again. Aircraft is brand new, maintained in pristine condition. Online checkin experience can be better, no clear steps of how to proceed. First time users, good luck with the process. but won’t complaint. Checkin at the airport was quick and can’t expect anything more. Boarding process can be improved, as there were no clear instructions for the lines. People were impatient and it was a mess. I was traveling JFK-Kuwait-Chennai (KU118). On time flight left the gate, probably since it’s weekend and peak hours we were taxiing for more than 30 mins. This delayed the departure quite badly. Snacks served right after take off, food was very good. Snack and Brunch menu have many options for vegetarians and kids as well. Crew were very friendly and was available to help the needy people. In my flight onboard WiFi was available. It is not free and it’s pay per use. $10-30mins, $20-60mins, $40-180mins. -Kuwait International airport, very unorganized arrival security and transit procedures. One staff handling the entire crowd and verifying the boarding pass. Airport have free WiFi, can be used to get in touch with dear ones. Transit, airport is under construction. You need to find the way around things and figure out on your own. Transit lounges are available, if there is a bigger layover (my case flight delayed by 3hours) you should use the facility. It’s free and has lot of seats. Connection flight, boarding again another chaos. Until last minute no clear information about the boarding gates. Once announced (literally one ground staffed shouted, no proper PA system) all the people came running to the gates. Could have been organized better. Since everyone came in random order, it took lot of time to settle down. Baggage, it could be the time of the day, but almost took one hour for collecting the bags. With the lean crowd, officials were not organized and bags in random order. Overall I will not recommend this carrier for family trips, if you are alone and want an adventurous trip then go for it. Be prepared for nasty surprises.

### "my experience was great"
Manila to Kuwait, my experience was great. The staff were very friendly at ground and throughout the journey. The seat was very comfortable and the leg room was great. The food was great and plenty. The entertainment system was good but could use some improvement in more variety of movies and music. All in all I would say it is 9/10 but considering the ticket price.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Bangalore to London via Kuwait. Having read poor reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and comfort of the planes and the good service. Both flights were punctual enough and baggage delivery was speedy. Almost my best experience of flight from India to a hub airport.

### "I would recommend"
We found the best option to go to Istanbul from Bangalore on Kuwait Airways having a transit in Kuwait airport. The trip from Bangalore to Istanbul was very comfortable suprisingly, the food was great, flight was comfy and great legroom in almost all the flights. Kuwait airport was not bad but lacked some basic amenities. Overall I would recommend Kuwait airways

### "probably avoid this airline"
New York to Mumbai via Kuwait. The two major problems were with boarding, and seat assignments. During boarding, it was a bit chaotic. There is no structured line dividers or anything. It was a big confusion trying to board, and rather tedious. The second was our seat arrangements. We had already reserved a seat online while booking, but when boarding, the agent suddenly changed my seat and my parents seats. We got in the plane, and then 30 mins later a flight attendant asked us if we can switch our seats with this guy who had children. Apparently she can’t seat children by the exit, and that’s fine. But this needed to be sorted out by the airline beforehand. Most importantly, the meals are based by the seat numbers. So when we changed seats like 2 times, we almost got the wrong meals. We had to tell the flight attendant our selected meal preference during the booking, otherwise we would’ve received the wrong meals. I mean it’s a service we paid for. The food was decent though. It was an alright flight for the price of the tickets. However, I’d probably avoid this airline if I could. It’s only worth it if you don’t have another option or are on a budget.

### "It was the worst travel experience"
Not Verified |  We traveled with Kuwait Airways recently for the first time from JFK to go to Chennai, India, specifically for a friend’s wedding. We had a group of 7 of us traveling to the wedding, including the bride and groom. Our flight left 3 hours late from NYC and we were told by the team on flight that we wouldn’t miss our connecting Kuwait flight to Chennai and that they wait for even 1 passenger. Sure enough when we got to Kuwait the connecting flight had left and they said they cannot wait for anyone. The next flight was a day later and after pleading they switched the 7 of us to a SriLankan Airlines flight and advised us to travel to Sri Lanka and then to Chennai and told us they were issuing the 7 of us the same flight. After waiting 6 hours in a very disorganized airport, the 7 of us arrived in Sri Lanka to find out that 2 of the members of our party (my husband and I) were issued the wrong flight that left 7 hours later from Sri Lanka. We begged the airlines there to let us on the earlier flight but since it was Kuwait Airways’ mistake we couldn’t get on the flight. After 33 hours of traveling to the other side of the world, we ended up missing our friends wedding in Chennai and the bride and groom lost money on several events they had to cancel leading up to their wedding. It was the worst travel experience we have ever had and we are frequent international travelers. Don’t fly this airlines unless you enjoy nightmares.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  London to Islamabad via Kuwait. Well, probably the worst airline ever. Check in staff allocating us (12 of us) seats to every single corner of the plane, my wife was lucky to have a seat with our little ones. Secondly, due to delay, we were rushed to our seats and hand baggage was placed everywhere. Food was excellent but our entertainment screens turned off mid air along with the assistance button, system failure or something. On top of all that, they lost our one piece of luggage on the way to Pakistan and as well as coming back. If this is the last plane to catch i will not catch it. Definitely avoid Kuwait as well, rude behaviour of airport staff and one star airport service.

### "my ticket had been canceled"
Paris to Manila via Kuwait. My story is not common but will prove the incompetence of this company. In early January, I wrote a message about Whatsapp to the airline, wanting information on the cancellation conditions because I was not sure I could honor my flight. The person who answered me was very responsive, told me that I had until 24 hours before my flight to cancel, that I would have 200 euros penalty, etc. The message ended on the fact that if I wanted to cancel my ticket, I had to send an email. Very clear. On January 26th, I went to the check-in counter at Roissy Airport to go to Manila in the Philippines. To my surprise, I learned that my ticket had been canceled due to this Whatsapp conversation. Namely that I have not received any notification by mail, or even by message of any cancellation. I transferred the conversation to the ground manager, who contacted them because he did not understand why such a decision, especially that on the messages, I had no mention of any cancellation. The manager at the airport of Paris CDG, despite having seen that I suffered the incompetence of the company for which he works, asked me to contact them. Of course I did not get any answer. He took my file very lightly. It works at the head of the customer from what I understood on the spot, he had the power to press a button and resolve the situation to let me ship but he did nothing. Good it was that my head did not pass! He told me that the staff on the other side of the phone did not find the person responsible for this error so I had a refusal to board and that the flight was complete. (My friend was there, there were free places) So I suffered the incompetence of their staff. By their fault, I had to buy a plane ticket one way Paris - Manila to + 570 € with another company to join my friend who had to leave without me. I sent emails to the company Kuwait, I received after 10 days a file number. FR: Mon histoire n’est pas commune mais vous prouvera de l'incompétence de cette compagnie. Début janvier, j’ai écrit un message sur Whatsapp à la compagnie aérienne, voulant des renseignements sur les conditions d’annulation car je n'étais pas certaine de pouvoir honorer mon vol. La personne qui m’a répondu a été très réactive, m’a dit que j’avais jusqu'à 24h avant mon vol pour annuler, que j’aurais 200 euros de pénalité, etc. Le message s’est terminé sur le fait que si je voulais annuler mon ticket, je devais envoyer un mail. Très clair. Le 26 janvier, je me suis présentée au guichet d’enregistrement à l'aéroport de Roissy pour me rendre à Manille aux Philippines. À ma grande surprise, j’ai appris que mon ticket avait été annulé suite à cette conversation Whatsapp. À savoir que je n’ai reçu aucune notification par mail, ni même par message d’une quelconque annulation. J’ai transféré la conversation au responsable au sol, qui les a contacté car il n’a pas compris pourquoi une telle décision, surtout que sur les messages, je n’ai eu aucune mention d’une quelconque annulation. Le responsable à l'aéroport de Paris CDG, malgré qu’il a vu que je subissais l'incompétence de la compagnie pour laquelle il travaille m’a demandé de les contacter. Bien évidemment je n’ai obtenu aucune réponse. Il a prit mon dossier très à la légère. Il fonctionne à la tête du client d'après ce que j’ai compris sur place, qu’il avait le pouvoir d’appuyer sur un bouton et de régler la situation pour me laisser embarquer mais il n’a rien fait. Bon c’est que ma tête ne passait pas ! Il m’a dit que le personnel de l’autre côté du téléphone ne trouvait pas le responsable de cette erreur donc j’avais un refus d'embarquer et que de plus le vol était complet. ( Mon ami y était, il y avait des places de libres ) J’ai donc subit l'incompétence de leur personnel. Par leur faute, j’ai du racheter un billet d’avion aller simple Paris - Manille a + 570€ avec une autre compagnie afin de rejoindre mon ami qui a du partir sans moi. J’ai envoyé des mails à la compagnie Kuwait, j’ai reçu après 10 jours un numéro de dossier.

### "the staff very hit and miss"
I had my reservations after booking with Kuwait Airways when reading some of the reviews, but financially I thought yep it’ll be ok. We departed England on the 16 December, Heathrow terminal 4, the check in was quite frankly horrendous and the member of staff was abrupt, rude and mean, but I thought you pay the price you take your chance. After checking in and all the security checks we boarded our flight to Kuwait. The plane itself was fine, the staff very hit and miss depending on who you spoke to, footnote the entertainment system is standard and certain meals run out, mainly the chicken courses, but I kept thinking of the price. Arrived in Kuwait, 6 hours of nothing, quite possibly the most desolete airport of nothing. We were given a free meal consisting of a cheese roll, stodgy cake and an orange juice. Our connecting flight to Manila was again ok, again staff very hit and miss. Enjoyed our three week holiday and returned to Manila Ninnoy international airport for return trip on the 7 Jan 2019. The check in was very standard and annoying and yet more security checks after the security checks, the flight itself was ok but the staff are again vacant not caring, food again was what was left! Arrived in Kuwait for 6 more hours of deep joy followed by 2 lots of security checks, we were boarding while people were still being security cleared! Flight back to England again ok but all the same issues as before. My thoughts on Kuwait Airways? In my humble opinion dont use them, they seem to think the customer has no choice, a ‘like it and lump it attitude’, the planes clean and tidy yet the staff were aggressive and rude. My wife and two children have flown many times but this is the first time we all said never again with Kuwait Airways, the savings are there but if you value your common decency and self worth look elsewhere for your flight arrangements.

### "poor service they provide"
London to Kuwait City. On arriving at Heathrow terminal 4 (1.17 hours before my flight departure) I was told by a rude man who works for Kuwait Airways that my flight had closed. He said I was too late to check in. He said the desk were checking in passengers (the people in the queue) for a later flight. He told me that I could not join the queue and I could not speak to another member of staff on the check in desk. I informed him that it was over an hour to my flight departure therefore I was not late. He said I was, and that I needed to step aside, “go over there” waving his hand dismissively and book another ticket for a later flight. Most people with a hint of empathy can imagine that at this point I was upset and anxious as I weighed up both the financial implications due to purchasing another ticket, and the work implications as a result of arriving in Kuwait a day late and missing work. Therefore, I ignored this inept Kuwait Airways employee, and spoke to a woman on the check in desk. My attempts to reach her were comical as he attempted to block my path the whole way while raising his voice to bark orders at me. To my surprise, the woman at the desk informed me that my flight was open. Even more outrageously, everyone in the queue was getting on the same flight and the people joining the queue after I had arrived were also getting on the same flight. It was at this point I joined the line to check in. The same staff rushed over to what I later learned was his supervisors during my exchange with the woman behind the desk. He later returned at my side to inform me that he would “allow me” to check in, but the incident was my fault, I should have got there 1.20 hour before the departure time. It was a misunderstanding, but It was my fault! Needless to say, I was astounded! I complained to his line manager who was also very unprofessional and obviously his friend, so I have placed a formal written complaint with their superiors. I have never experienced such incompetence by an airline. I would recommend other potential passengers consider if they really want to fly with this airline. The low star ratings and negative feedback from other passengers is reflective of the poor service they provide. The only positive in want was an experience that almost brought me to tears was a lovely woman who checked me in. She was very effective and embodied excellent customer care. If Kuwait Airways recognised and promoted their good staff rather than allowing a clique of obnoxious inefficient people to rise to higher front line positions, they might be able to start turning around the substandard service and negative feedback from their customers.

### "their horrible service"
Kuwait to Delhi. Never fly with Kuwait Airways. No responsibility for connecting flights. They might have better prices but they will compensate with their horrible service. Flights are  overbooked so they would off load you and give you the next flight on the next day. And in this process they misplace your luggage and promise to get it delivered to your door steps however eventually charge you for the delivery.

### "don't care about customers"
New York JFK to Dubai via Kuwait. Very spacious legroom for economy but frequent Late flights. IFE had a small selection of movies, cabin Crew extremely rude and unprofessional. Ground Staff rude and unhelpful. Transfer experience at Kuwait is confusing and difficult. Kuwait Airport lacks many facilities common in most international airports Review: I initially booked this flight because it was the cheapest option to Dubai, around $60 cheaper than the competition; big mistake. I did not have a single flight with Kuwait, either on my way to Dubai or back that was on time. From JFK, my flight was delayed for 3 hours, causing me to miss my connection to Dubai. They put us in a Hotel on Airport property, which, although had a good view of the apron, was a sub-par hotel. The ground staff do not know how to do their job correctly. They are rude, and the airport lacks proper signage. You are bussed around from terminal to terminal with no real staff presence to guide you. We almost missed our flight to JFK because the gate was labeled Mumbai, so we didn't know that it was intended for New York. Kuwait Airport doesn't even seem qualified to be a domestic airport, lacking proper signage and two distant terminals which you're bussed around in. Ground crew does not care about you, and show no interest or courtesy when dealing with you. The same can be said with the cabin crew. They are rude, and do not know how to treat passengers. The meal timings are horrible, as they leave many passengers extremely hungry for long hours on the plane, and water service is extremely selective. You'd think an airline knows when to give out water and food. They also gave us no details about our stop in Shannon on our way back to JFK and could not be seen for much of the flight. The only good part about the flight was the legroom, which was spacious. However, that is not a reason for booing Kuwait over any other competent airline. Do not book Kuwait, they don't care about customers and lack the competency to even communicate basic necessary facts to customers.

### "Worst airline ever"
New York to Kuwait via Mumbai. Worst airline ever, no respect for customer comfort. There was water leaking in the flight. Then on Kuwait airport where I was shuttled 2 between transit center at one end of the airport to the gate at other end where one is supposed to take the terminal transfer bus. With no absolute coordination between the staff for execution of a smooth journey.

### "we faced the rudest staff"
Not Verified |  I traveled from Dubai to Islamabad via Kuwait with my wife and we had one of the worst experiences. Our flight was delayed for an hour and by the time when we arrived to Kuwait we missed our flight to Islamabad and our nightmare started from there - we faced the rudest staff, we have been given one of the worst hotel. If you missed your connected flight because Kuwait Airways have no mercy, they will treat like your fault you missed your flight.

### "Never ever fly this airline"
This is the worst airline I have ever travelled in. Took flight to Paris from Delhi via Kuwait in September 2018 and back in December 2018. All flights were delayed with no correct and timely information from the staff. Technical failures are very common. For some unknown reason Kuwaitis are fond of security checks. Everytime to board a flight we had to go through security twice for no apparent reason. They have worst kind of customer service and in name of compensation for delay provide sub-standard meals with bread and juice. Even in case of a small protest from flyers security is called who are rude and have no sense of handling the situation. Never ever fly via this airline if you have even little respect for your time.

### "Poor service on the plane"
Manila to London via Kuwait. Beyond poor. 9 hours delayed with no prior communication. Not even updated the details online. The flight was delayed as the aircraft had not even set off yet from Manila - so they obviously knew the delay was coming. False claims of poor weather from the airline. On prior flights two weeks before were not much better. Poor service on the plane, no service in Kuwait airport.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Colombo to London via Kuwait. Worst experience ever with an airline. Both flying out for holiday and upon return. We have been lied to about what will happen for our connecting flights that departed without ~30 passengers. Kept waiting for hours only to find out we will not be completing our travel for another 24 hours. Twice. No apologies and no communication.

### "the worst airline ever"
Kochi to London via Kuwait. Kuwait Airways is the worst airline ever. First flight delayed and missed the connection flight from Kuwait. Our trip got delayed by 24 hours delay. Hundreds of passengers with similar delays simply being dumped into the airport hotel. Extremely rude behaviour from the ground staff. No apologies offered on both the trips. One of the staff even told us "nobody forced you to book Kuwait Airways". Don't know why and how such a terrible airline exist. Literally taking the passengers for a ride. Do not fly Kuwait Airways. Simply avoid.

### "I am positively fuming"
Not Verified |  London to Bangkok via Kuwait. I feel sorry for Kuwait having unusually bad weather in November, but that is where my sympathy ends. The decision was made the day before we travelled for the government to suspend work at all ministries, state institutions and colleges etc so why the airport remained open was a mystery. We arrived into Kuwait and there was rain - no more than a typical day in London. Our connection time of 2 hours actually lasted 26 hours and we missed the wedding in Thailand that we were travelling for! There is a complete lack of order in this airport, they have a tannoy system and screens outside of the gates that never got used. They did not communicate to the whole airport that it had been closed due to poor weather conditions instead sending thousands of people to 1 transit desk which had zero queuing. No hotels were provided, nor was basic blankets or pillows, a shocking meal of bread and a carton of juice and then cold plane food the next morning. Nobody working there knew what was going on, the airport continued to let in passengers the following day even with the large backlog from the night before. The airport is obsessed with searches, even though you have been stuck in the airport all night each time you went through a gate you and all your belongings were searched, bottles of water you brought in the airport were taken off you. The place sprung leaks all over with the rain, the floor was hazardous and buckets were all around trying to catch the leaking water. No plane that I caught with them left on time, the staff had a too laid back attitude, no one communicated what was going on, you were told to sit down and relax which is not what you want to be told after a 26hour delay in a airport with no sleep, no blankets and rubbish cold plane food! Return journey was equally a joke, landed into a terminal, searched, put on a bus to drive past planes on the runway, searched another 2 times in 15 mins and then put back onto a bus to go to a plane that we had already gone past - what was the point?! Overall I found the service abysmal from start to finish, there is a complete lack of customer service, no concept of communication and I am positively fuming that the decision not to close the airport at the start of weds was not taken which could have prevented a lot of people getting stranded in the airport. Above all I am so angry that there incompetence meant I missed the wedding of a very close friend.

### "Total incompetence from all"
London  to Colombo via Kuwait. Awful airline, completely inept to provide a service. We missed connecting flights to and from our destination, due to delayed planes on the first flights, even though all were provided by the Kuwait Airways. On the return journey we arrived with the aircraft in view, and were told the gate was closed, despite the screen still saying proceed to gate, and being told the flight would be held for us. The plane was there for 30 minutes while we protested, and one gentleman's passport was taken from his person by a security guard when he tried to take a photo of the plane. Following this, there was no communication provided, we were left to gather our own information from the transit desk, where there was over 1000 people we were told. The result was a delay of over 30 hours on the flight out to Colombo, and 20 hours on the way back, and 3 unwanted nights in Kuwait airport's hotel. At no point were we offered an apology. Total incompetence from all involved, each individual shrugged off the blame elsewhere. Do not use.

### "regret choosing this cheap airline"
Doha to Kuwait. I tried to travel during the heavy rains in Kuwait, had to wait 6 hours to check in and after that 6 hours at the gate. Kuwait Airways representative was hiding, no info, no service at all. I decided to cancel my ticket, went back to the check in counter and after I tried to do the same through their whatsapp as well but no answer at all. Sent email for refund, same story. They are not answering the phone either. I regret choosing this cheap airline, but will never make the same mistake again.

### "Miserable experience"
Not worth any saving you think you might make. Miserable experience. Customer service non existent. The flight itself was alright, although they gave us no reason for a delay and promised all of us repeatedly that our connection flight with Kuwait Airways will wait for us. Once we arrived there was no information for hours, we got shipped around on two bus rides to various terminals. At the 3rd terminal after insisted chasing for information we were told our flight to Colombo had left already. Waiting for hours in a crowded waiting room we had to call customer services on the phone to (no one at the desks were willing to tell us!) learn that we can only continue our journey tomorrow. Stranded at the airport without any hotels or information for the next 24 hours, this is unacceptable.

### "wasn’t enough leg space"
London Heathrow to Lahore via Kuwait. I have recently flown with Kuwait on a return trip to visit family. It was extremely difficult to book a child’s meal and I was unable to on the outbound flight. I managed to book it over the phone for the return flight after explaining to them that I was unable to do this in their website as I couldn’t enter my child’s date of birth. The seats were comfortable however there wasn’t enough leg space on the flight to relax properly. The outbound flight was delayed by 90 minutes which almost caused me to miss my connecting flight at Kuwait. There was no WiFi available at Kuwait airport to use. The washrooms at Kuwait were dirty and the water taps weren’t working. It was also extremely difficult to find the correct terminal on the return flight as it wasn’t signposted clearly enough. The meals on the flight and entertainment were fine and the aircraft staff were polite. All information was available in the aircraft.

### "Improved cabin as aircraft was new"
Flew Kuwait Airways from Jeddah to Bangkok via Kuwait. Improved cabin as aircraft was new. Mediocre but decent food. The problem is the layover in KWI. They are using the old airport still with less facilities. I only have an hour stopover, arriving at the airport, there aren't any signs directing you to your next gates for departure. On my return, the gate number on my boarding pass was not the same as the actual gate used. Good thing I was alert and looked around as there is no one waiting outside the mentioned gate. KWI-JED route, I think there are less than 50 passengers only.

### "Customer service was rude"
I was flying from Delhi to New York via Kuwait through Kuwait Airways. On 29 Oct 2018 I missed my connecting flight because my flight was delayed from Delhi by more then 70 minutes. Although my connecting flight (KU117) was there when our flight reached but they didn’t allow us to board the plane. Customer service was rude and pathetic. One of the help desk agent told that they are used to this. Many passengers asked for managers but he never came.

### "Customer service was rude"
I was flying from Delhi to Delhi to New York via Kuwait through Kuwait Airways. I missed my connecting flight Because my flight was delayed from Delhi by more then 70 minutes. Although my connecting flight (KU117) was there when our flight reached but they didn’t allow us to board the plane. Customer service was rude and pathetic. One of the help desk agent told that they are used to with this. Many passengers asked for managers but he never came.

### "missed the connecting flight"
Not Verified | Flight departed 1 hour late from the original starting point hence the 1 hour layover at Kuwait was missed and hence I missed the connecting flight from Kuwait. Initially the staff didn't take any responsibility and only offered the same flight the next day and hotel accommodation but I had to reach COK urgently. After 3 hours of struggle, talks and debates a manager turned up and people who didn't have to travel urgently were sent to a hotel and the rest of us were booked onto an alternative airline (Oman in my case via Muscat) which would get me to my destination 9 hours later than my original itenary, had no choice!

### "wait another 15 hours"
New York JFK to Kuwait. It was just little bit raining that’s why they cancel flight. We were waiting more than 5 hours then they cancel the flight. I have to wait another 15 hours for the next flight. What should I do now since I live very far away from JFK and they didn’t even offer for hotel.

### "forgot my luggage in Kuwait"
Not Verified |  New York to Delhi via Kuwait. Water Bottle not provided in the flight so every time you want to drink water you have to call the flight attendant and she will bring a small glass of water for you. Flight delayed 1.5 Hr and second time it delayed 1/2 hr. They forgot my luggage in Kuwait, though it had a tag of Delhi. They are not picking my call. Vegetarian food is not available, you have to give special order for vegetarian food. Mostly food was halal and pork free. Too much of crowd, if you are travelling in economic class you have to be in a long queue for every check-in boarding. Blanket will be provided to those who ask for it. It was WiFi equipped but paid so I don't know how was the speed. For entertainment it had decent number of nice movies. Movies in english Islamic Hindi but subtitles available only is Arabic. Announcement were mainly in Arabic and English.

### "three seats to myself"
New York to Dubai via Kuwait. Before booking, I had read many reports about the improved Kuwait Airways and unbeatable price. I was unsure what to expect. The check-in was a breeze at JFK and the agent said it was a light flight with about 35-40% load factor. That was surprising being just a day before Eid. Boarding was easy, and the aircraft pushed back 15 min before schedule. JFK-KWI flight, the aircraft very clean and seats comfortable. Legroom was fantastic. I managed to get a window seat and had all the three seats to myself. Rather almost everyone in the aft cabin had 3 seats to themselves. Individual TV screen was very responsive with a decent collection of programming. The crew was friendly and courteous. Menus, blanket, and basic amenity pouch handed out. Food was ok but can improve in quality. Was concerned about the short 45 min connection in Kuwait, but the flight arrived about an hour early. Kuwait airport is medieval and dirty with a few coffees and duty-free shops. Security checks are not centralized but occur at each gate leading to long lines and delays. My KWI-DXB flight (B 777-300 ER) was packed and was delayed more than an hour due to long lines at gate security. The short flight was uneventful and were handed out in a takeaway Iftar meal boxes. So, an in all a rather good flight. Return leg: DXB-KWI (A320) was short and uneventful with breakfast boxes handed out. KWI-JFK via Shannon was painful with an 85% load. Long security lines at the gate in Kuwait. One of the Kuwaiti pax who I chatted with was like - this flight is always delayed. Multiple security checks and verifications. Lotta connecting passengers mostly from South Asia and some of them didn’t know the flight had a stopover at Shannon. Lunch served, and amenity kits handed out. My choice of meal had run out but was nothing great. All pax deplaned at Shannon to go through multiple hellish security points and get back in about 2 hrs. It just gave time to stretch and use the toilets. Cabin crew was cheerful and courteous but I asked for blankets and was told none remain, however at the time of deplaning at JFK found an open overhead bin full of blankets. Verdict: Decent airline but Kuwait airport needs an urgent upgrade. Shannon stop over is painful. Yes, fantastic price, beating some of the major middle east airlines by 35% on this route. If you’re not budget constraint choose a better airline for this route.

### "the worst customer care service"
Frankfurt to Jeddah via Kuwait. It's the second time within a few months that my connection in Kuwait City could not be reached, due to delay from Frankfurt. Every time I had to stay over night in Kuwait City. The first time I received only a registration number from their customer care service, when I entered my complaint on their website. I asked several times for a response, but they never send me an answer for my first complaint. Currently on 19.06.2018 it was the same situation again. But now then even don't send me a registration number for my second complaint. You have always to fight to get a hotel room for the over night stay in Kuwait. The first time they forced me to share a hotelroom and a double bed with an unfamiliar person. It's the worst customer care service I have ever recognized in my life. I don't expect to receive now any response from them. My advice is, avoid this airline, if you expect an airline with an acting customer care service!

### "Worst customer service"
Mumbai to JFK via Kuwait. Worst customer service. I didn't get a blanket even though I was feeling very cold and on requesting - I was told first older peoples would get and finally I was told all blankets are over. Coming to food I am a vegetarian and cabin crew ran out of vegetarian food and were asking me to try other options as they don't have vegetarian food. When I insisted I don't want non vegetarian food then after half an hour when everyone finished their meal they gave me vegetarian meal and that too it was very very limited quantity. Same thing applies to soft drinks. Very cheap and unprofessional staff. You have to tell them 2-3 times at least if you need anything be it water or any other help.

### "the service was top notch"
This was my first ever time I flew with Kuwait Airways or through Kuwait Airport. Since this is a review of the aircraft and its services, I shall highlight that here. To begin with, before flying this airline - I had read reviews online not too favorable - however I was blown away the moment I stepped into the flight KU 411 flying to Bangkok on 08 May 2018. Yes, the aircraft was new and only showcased where Kuwait is redesigning itself from its old tired image. The branding, the uniforms of the crew and most importantly the spacious economy class seats - wow! I never expected this and the service was top notch. The crew who served me were very gracious, very presentable and attended to everyone's needs. On-board entertainment - the screen were huge for economy class and the choice on the in-flight entertainment was pretty decent - a wider variety would be perfect! In-flight food - the food was decent and you are given a good dose of refills of beverage to your delight. The restroom/toilet space was my only concern - may be KU accepted giving more space and comfort on its new flights - compromising on the size of the rest rooms - its a bit tight once you in - but hey if you are smart - look for the toilets built for the disabled - its a pretty decent size - in the mid section of the plane. Overall, I would give a big thumps up to Kuwait Airways and hope you build on this from here.

### "friendly and competent staff"
Bangkok to Rome via Kuwait. I have already flown with Kuwait Airways and I think I'll book even for this winter. New Aircraft, on time, friendly and competent staff both onboard and on the ground. And the Dasman Lounge in Kuwait airport is a real pleasure to spend time on coincidence. Restaurant-bar "fornitissimo", smoking-room inside where they offer you Arabian coffee, efficient wifi, clean bathrooms as not seen at other airports. There are no alcoholic beverages but on  long trips you have to hydrate yourself with water.

### "airline is not worth the money"
Mumbai to New York via Kuwait. The flight was 2 hours late coming into JFK, 6 hour layover in Kuwait airport going and 18 hour layover on Kuwait coming back. Flight was delayed by another 2.5half hours at Kuwait airport. Total 20.5 hours. Seems like the crew is not trained to help customers with the connecting flights and I experienced further delays so I missed my connecting flight. Also they do two stopovers coming from Mumbai, but you are told only about one. They jerk you and are not truthful about who to contact to try to help you. At JFK airport the Kuwait Airways staff said they are not responsible for me missing my flight, even though the flight was late. Kuwait airport has only two stores and they are very expensive compared to the USA. The amount of layovers and delays with this airline is not worth the money saved. You are better off going with another airline.

### "legroom was perfect"
Manila to Paris return via Kuwait. The plane in the Manila sectors was amazing, legroom was perfect. The inflight entertainment was good though not the best since I believe it caters more to Middle Eastern Passengers but the library of hollywood movies is still ok. Food is good and better than some airlines. Departure and arrival were on time. The Paris flights uses a different plane, a much older plane. The legroom is less than the Manila flight. The service was still the same though. I'll ride Kuwait Airways again given the chance.

### "recommend this airline highly"
London  to Manila via Kuwait was possibly one of the best flights we have taken. The plane was quite new, the staff absolutely fabulous,  service first class. The legroom adequate, the inflight entertainment excellent. Kuwait airport has a lovely bunch of duty free shops. The fact that it’s an alcohol free flight was quite refreshing actually, no staying up drinking, everyone relaxed. I do drink alcohol, and it was lovely not to on this occasion). We were given blankets, pillows and all done with such professional smiling charm. I would recommend this airline highly.

### "satisfied considering the price"
Mumbai to Istanbul via Kuwait. All flights were on time. Both type of aircrafts (B777-300 and A320) we flew on were newer ones and seats were super comfy in economy. B777-300 had 3-3-3 config and leg space and seats were very good and comfortable. This aspect was better than some other Middle Eastern airlines. Inflight service was okayish. Food experienced was mix one. Food on some legs was very tasty. Overall, satisfied considering the price of the tickets. I would definitely fly them again and would recommend others to do so.

### "looking forward to flying again"
Dubai to Kuwait. Excellent service from Kuwait Airways. There were two women from the Kuwait Airways office Dubai that were able to get me onto the flight quite quickly. I would've missed my flight if it wasn't for them. Thanks again and looking forward to flying your carrier again for the future.

### "worst experience ever"
Cochin to New York via Kuwait. The worst customer service and worst experience ever. On my return trip from Cochin to JFK, the plane from Cochin was delayed. This should have made the connecting flight from Kuwait also be delayed so that we would be able to board upon arrival in Kuwait. However, this was not the case since the closed off the gate when we landed in Kuwait. When I had arrived at the terminal, talking to the staff, they said that we weren’t even on the system meaning that they were willing to keep us in Kuwait for a day since Cochin and didn’t just didn’t care. There were six customers inclusive of myself that had to go through this and I was informed that this is done regularly by the airline as one of the customers said this happens to him previously as well. Normally, I wouldn’t really care about this but I took emergency leave from work to attend my Gramdfather’s funeral in India. Having to stay an additional day on emergency leave may make the integrity of leave blurry to my employer especially since I had just joined only a week prior. I have never experienced such a horrible customer service and a lack of care. I will never fly with this horrible airline again.

### "by far the worst airline"
Bahrain to Dubai via Kuwait, first time with Kuwait airways and for sure it will be my last time. Most unorganised and unprofessional airline. If you want to delay and spend hours in airports then this is the airline you choose. Had business trip in Bahrain then Kuwait and back to Dubai. BAH-KWI was delayed by 2 hrs a very old A320 dirty and noisy, uncomfortable leather seats, no screens, dirty toilets. Delay without any information and had to spent hours at BAH for a 50 mins flight. KWI-DXB was even worse at the most chaotic airport in Kuwait which is the hub of the airline. Was at the airport at 7:30am for my 9:45am flight the check in counters are the most unorganised and chaotic. Their ground staff are very rude and keep giving wrong information . It was a remote gate and can you imagine checking in 3 flights at the same time from the same gate. Then suddenly they say my flight is delayed while we were at the gate and flight was removed from the screen then had to check with their airline ground staff who are also rude and unprofessional eventually we leave 2 hrs later with a fairly new A330 aircarft seemed clean however Entertainment not the best and didn’t really matter hence a 90 mins flight . Lunch was adequate for the flight however the crew were again arrogant and seems distant and not interested in serving people. I’m a frequent flyer and tried all airlines in the region this is by far the worst airline and most arrogant staff I’ve ever encountered.

### "recommend spending money on other airlines"
Delhi to Paris via Kuwait. The flight got delayed twice and I was stranded in the night at the airport. Never book Kuwait airways as the passengers travelling were not good and the airline did nothing over the issue. I highly recommend spending money on other airlines.

### "Bad on board service"
Manila to Kuwait. Seats are ok flat bed seats. however you should not expect anything else. Seems this airline you pay for seat nothing more. Bad on board service even more terrible ground services. Flight scheduled at 10am they rescheduled it twice, below average business lounge. went to hotel airport terrible, could not stay there went back.

### "comfort in the flight"
Istanbul to Dubai via Kuwait City. I ended up with Kuwait airways as I missed my flight with fly dubai and I had to book a return ticket at the earliest. The only option i could see was Kuwait airways. I had none of the bad experiences others talked about. Agreed that they are not as courteous as some airline's crew but can’t deny the comfort in the flight, there is food served onboard as well as in flight entertainment which need to be paid for on flydubai which costs same price but 0 comfort. If given a chance i’ll again fly with Kuwait airways and hopefully other people get to share a similar experience as me.

### "Unprofessional cabin crew"
Flew Kuwait Airways from Frankfurt to Manila via Kuwait. Unprofessional cabin crew. One crew member even told me that he could not give me water a second time around, yes I asked for a second time as I was thirsty. Unprofessional and untrained staff. I will not be flying with them again. I am a frequent flyer and this was my second worst experience after Air India.

### "Rude and ignoring passengers"
Ahmedabad to New York via Kuwait. Ground staff were not present in Ahmedabad. Flight was delayed 2.5 hours. They never notified passengers about the delays. Same problem continues in Kuwait and Shannon as well. There was not a single person from the airline to provide any updates regarding delay. Crew members: Rude and ignoring passengers. They didn't provide water after asking twice. Even pressing the assist button didn't help. Blankets were not provided on boarding. You had to ask for blankets. During my Kuwait to Shannon flight I asked the air hostess to provide a blanket, she responded "we are running out of the blankets". I saw that more than 50% of passengers didn't have any blankets. Food: Food was decent when I was flying from JFK to AHD but it was pathetic during my return.

### "cabin crew were absolutely unprofessional"
Flew Colombo to London via Kuwait. The cabin crew were absolutely unprofessional and did not treat passengers respectfully. Their customer services are very bad and I would advise anybody not to fly Kuwait Airways. Its the worst airline I have travelled.

### "reasonably good airline"
I took my first Kuwait Airways flight on 3 January 2018, from Delhi (DEL) to New York (JFK) via Kuwait (change of plane), and a so-called technical stop at Shannon, Ireland. I had read all horror stories of reviewers related to Kuwait Airways as well as Kuwait Airport and was apprehensive. But, having experienced my first trip, I found that this is a reasonably good airline. Both my flights (DEL-KWI and KWI-JFK) had European stewardesses and they were well trained, professional, and helpful. The food offered on board was really good that exceeded my expectations. I had requested special meals, and I got my meals. What they can do better is that, on the KWI-JFK flight, which is actually 8+8 hours' flights with Shannon as the mid-point, they should frequently offer water to the passengers. Both flights were the wide-bodied Boeing 777 with 3+3+3 configuration in the economy class, which is quite comfortable (the Emirates cramps this 3+4+3 configuration). The toilets were reasonably clean throughout, although, the number of toilets should be increased, given the size of the plane. The worst part of the trip was the stopover at Shannon - both the act itself and the lack of correct information thereof. I was told at Delhi that this will be a technical stop, and the stewardesses said that the plane will stop at Shannon for a maximum of one and a half hours. However, the reality was totally different. All the passengers were ordered to get out of the plane at Shannon with their belongings in the cabin. Then, a long line for security check. The security staff manually checked the cabin bags of the passengers and then put them into the X-Ray machine. This was a time-consuming affair and the airport authorities had already allocated three and a half hours for this exercise. As result, the plane arrived in New York two and a half hours behind schedule and caused inconvenience to all passengers. I am sure that stopping at Shannon is not a decision of Kuwait Airways. There is nothing to hide about this on the part of Kuwait Airways, and they should give correct information to their passengers. Another unpleasant and time consuming affair was at Kuwait airport itself, for "profiling" the passengers of the US-bound flight. They don't notify the passengers at the source airport of this exercise. So, when passengers line up for boarding, they are told to get the profiling clearance. In the process, there is routine delays for the departure of the New York bound plane.

### "not worth the cheap ticket"
Bangkok to New York via Kuwait / Shannon. This is the worst airline I have experienced. The flight attendants never answered our questions directly. They never replied when we asked if this was a direct flight to New York. When I asked how long we would we stay at Shannon airport before taking off for New York, the flight attendant just told me that no one is leaving this airport and that they needed to clean the plane. I asked to use the restroom and was told that there was no restroom at this particular area of the airport until we went through another security check after we just got off the plane. We already went through 2 security checks prior to boarding the plane in Bangkok. I had a pat down, a baggage check, and electronic check but apparently that was not enough. They separated me from my boyfriend and told me that I had to go through the longer security check at Shannon airport! I have had it with this airline. It is not worth the cheap ticket.

### "Passengers are so frustrated"
Dhaka to London via Kuwait. I am writing this after huge frustration the flight was supposed to take the of Friday morning 01.20 local time (Dhaka). After the intervention of passengers they decided to take them to hotel and bought back only to sit them around the terminal without any updates on flights. Surely you organise the flight before you bring them back to the airport. Again they are having to go without food without any information there isn’t any proper facility for bathroom use. Passengers are so frustrated that they are resulting in argument before any information is given to them.

### "the food was delicious"
Kuwait to Dubai. I traveled in First class with the new Boeing 777-300 that was really amazing, check in smoothly without trouble. Stewards are nice. Entertainment system had a lot of channels, the food was delicious. The Wifi was expensive.

### "worst customer service staff"
Frankfurt to Delhi via Kuwait. One of the worst customer service staff. I booked my ticket through skyscanner with a long stopover (more than 8 hours) returning back from Frankfurt and going back to Delhi. On approaching the check-in desk, I was informed that I have to pay 110 euros more to get a boarding pass as I need to have a hotel booking at the Airport hotel. I had no option or no flight for me. I was helpless in a foreign country. I had to pay and the hotel was too bad. Renovation noise disturbed me a lot. Now I have written to Kuwait Airways many times but they won't refund my money. Why nobody on my outward journey bothered to ask me to show the booking for my return? Why before booking my ticket these rules were not in the instructions?

### "Will definitely fly again"
Kuwait to London. Enjoyed the flight specially my kids the crew was very attentive, helpful and the seating was specious also leg area the entertainment was good with the option of listening to Quran. Will definitely fly again in Kuwait Airways during summer vacation.

### "the aircraft was not clean"
My flight with Kuwait Airways was from Beirut to Jeddah via Kuwait. The aircraft on both flights was the new Boeing 777-300ER, legroom is amazing, inflight entertainment and cabin crew were average and the aircraft was not clean. Services in Kuwait airport 0/10.

### "No service between meals"
❎ Not Verified |  New York JFK to Chennai via Kuwait and I opted for Kuwait Airways because of its low cost. The flight from JFK was delayed by 2 hours and the connecting flight from Kuwait was delayed for 2.5 hours more! There were not much information on the reasons for delay or ETA. I had AVML meal and quality of food was decent. There was no additional service trips by the cabin crew, even though we were waiting for 2+ hours on tarmac for take off. No service between meals.

### "not try Kuwait Airways again"
Colombo to Dammam via Kuwait in business class. The seats were good, and the entertainment systems. The food served was terrible! Surprisingly, the flight attendants were unaware as to what is contained in the meals served (basic things like fish or chicken) – to have the response that these are authentic Sri Lankan food : I factor some rudeness and unfriendliness in to that. Had to specifically ask for a head-set as well, even after having booked in the business class. The worst was KWI-DMM flight. It was supposed to take off at 8.30 am. The gates were not open till 8.15. Having boarded finally in to the aircraft – the crew has found that there are more than one boarding passes issued on the same seat for 3 passengers. There were discussion between the ground staff and the airline crew. Luckily the flight was not full – else someone could have been off-loaded. It was visible from the flight itself, that they are unloading a baggage carrier next to the flight - to locate some specific passenger luggage. Loading and unloading took some good time. Probably some mis-checked in items, but it had to wait till 9.30 am to fix. The flight left 1 hr 30 minutes late. They claimed that it was due to security reasons at the airport and baggage loading issues; now that is why they open the counters 3 hours in advance leaving adequate time for all that. To add to that, all the points I have noted here contributed to the delay. My checked-in luggage was tagged Priority / Business. It was among the last to receive at the belt Thanks to the efficiency of Kuwait airways – I missed my connecting flight from DMM (even after leaving 2 hours for transfer). Will not try Kuwait Airways again.

### "a lot of leg room"
The fight from Dhaka to New York went okay. There is a lot of leg room especially for economy. The food selection was okay. No blankets were provided. I had a 17 hour layover once I reached Kuwait where the airport provided a room at a airport hotel. Wouldn't let me leave. The next day the plane I boarded flight attendants were very friendly. Food was good. Hot towels were provided as well as blankets. We stopped at Shannon, Ireland without notice for another layover. Which is what I didn't like. A lot of layovers. Very bad selection for entertainment

### "good variety of in-flight entertainment"
Very annoying to start to Mumbai - New York JFK flight, plane delayed by an hour and a half. Good food, good variety of in-flight entertainment. Was told it was a new plane. Given breakfast and then snacks later on. Reached Kuwait and got in the queue for JFK. Extremely strict security. Again good meals and later snacks. Shannon was a stupid stopover, its a pain, trauma to get down the plane, wait in hour long queues for the crawling paced security, just stroll inside the small airport and then again wait in a queue to get back into the plane.

### "my worst experience"
Lahore to New York via New York. I was handed boarding cards from Lahore to Kuwait and same time I was given boarding cards from Kuwait to New York. I noticed that all the seats from Kuwait to New York are not together. Seats were given all over the place. I requested to staff but supervisor said, he will message to Kuwait and they will fix it. I spoke to staff at Kuwait airport but they could not help and re-arranged my seats to 16F,17F,18F and 17B. I was traveling with my wife and two kids ages 4 years and 8 years. At Kuwait, they also said, crew will help to sit together. In plan, I requested the same but no results. We had our kids on laps. I also like to mention, while waiting at Kuwait Gate 21, more than 100 peoples were standing because there are only few seats in waiting area of Gate 21. Flight was delayed 2 hours at Kuwait and no one explained any reason and passenger were standing and waiting to board. I been traveling from Lahore to New York from last 16 years and never had situation like this. This was my worst experience.

### "impressed with the leg space"
Chennai to New York via Kuwait / Shannon. I had a pleasant flying experience with Kuwait Airways. I was pretty impressed with the leg space which is important for the long flights. Food is good and I loved it. I will fly again with kuwait airways. Only issue I faced was no free wifi and expensive to buy even for 1 hr.

### "baggage was not delivered"
Delhi to London via Kuwait. DEL-KWI was delayed by 2 hours, smooth flight, nice new aircraft, personable cabin crew, (but no amenity kit in business class). My initial layover was supposed to be 2 hours and I expressed my concern about making my connection because of the delayed first leg to both check-in staff and cabin crew, to be assured that there would be no problem in making the connection. Landed at KWI around 4.45am Kuwait time. The KWI-LHR flight was supposed to depart at 5am. Got out of the aircraft to find there was no facilitation for transit passengers. Eventually managed to find the departure gate despite misleading signage. Again asked if my luggage would get transferred. Kept on being reassured that luggage was sure to get on with me. Eventually the flight took off around 6am, and reached Heathrow at 11am, an hour behind schedule. My baggage was not delivered at Heathrow. I filed a Property Irregularity Report at Terminal 4, specifically explaining that I was requesting priority handling of baggage hereafter up to delivery to me. No baggage after 30 hours. Spoke to the local courier company which delivers delayed bags. First told that baggage would be delivered 4-5pm BST. That time passed. Called again to be told that baggage on a delivery vehicle and will be delivered around 10pm. I was also told no one communicated that my bags should be provided priority handling. At the time of the review I am still awaiting my bags. There's no notification from Kuwait. They're rather prompt in washing their hands off this. All their ground operations are handled by ASC Handling. I am not sure if there is any recourse or compensation available to me. All in all, despite the pleasant enough flights, delay and loss of baggage is especially annoying. What's even worse is the Airline's insistence that they shouldn't be blamed somehow (the baggage transfer in Kuwait was being done on the carousel equipment that belonged to the local aviation authority, and baggage handling at LHR is contracted to ASC Handling. I find that assertion frankly untenable and fairly ridiculous. There's probably good reason not to continue to use KU in the future.

### "rude and unapproachable"
Mumbai to New York via Kuwait. The food and entertainment was good enough. Seats were comfy. The crew were rude and unapproachable. One has to think twice before asking for help. Stop at Kuwait is nothing short of feeling that you as a criminal are put to search. This stopover is a torture as there are not enough seats to take rest. Food is hot and edible. But this is by far the only airlines that is very economical.

### "an excellent experience"
Delhi to Kuwait. Check in was smooth enough. Boarding was done via a bus, not an aero-bridge, and the bus was very old and in ramshackle condition. An almost new Boeing 777-300, Business class has lie flat seats that are very comfortable. Service was all right, relatively unobtrusive and since this was a night flight, slept comfortably through most of it. Food was quite good. The IFE screen had the best resolution of any in-flight screen I've seen, with a brilliant nose and downward camera setup. The 3D maps are superb, with excellent information sets and customisation options. Not too many entertainment options though. Landed  on time and easy de-planing experience and headed to the lounge to wait for the next leg. All in all, an excellent experience.

### "was so disappointed"
Bahrain to Doha via Kuwait. The flight service was ok, but services at the ticketing counter is very poor, there is no organized staff all are confused, there is no customer care, there is no order in attending to customer while in a line. I stood out of the place for an hour till last i had to force my way through at the counter and ask for service because my flight was in the next hour, this was my first time I guess the last as well, i was so disappointed.

### "the service was pleasant"
A short but pleasant flight with Kuwait Airways from Doha to Kuwait. We were supposed to fly on an A320 but the equipment was changed due to the added pressure on the route, all business class was lie flat bed and the service was pleasant, they served a meal, nothing outstanding but nice. I would like to use them again.

### "nice food and service"
Kuwait Airways flight service from New York JFK to Trivandrum via Kuwait was neat and good. I enjoyed it as there is not much delay. For the cost I paid $600 USD and it was nice food and service. Though the take off took some time, it was almost closer to the landing time. No issues. I would definitely recommend this flight. Ground service customer care was not as good as I tried calling them for hours but they didn't pick up.

### "Thumbs up to Kuwait Airways"
Thumbs up to Kuwait Airways. We 5 passengers booked flights to and from Delhi to Frankfurt on 12th May and 23rd May respectively. The journey and food was excellent. The flight attendants and Inflight entertainment facilities were very good. Could improve by having wifi on board. Moreover the luggage allowance was good at 53 kgs (23 + 23 + 7). I would recommend this airline.

### "worst managed airlines"
London to Kuwait. Despite the lovely new aircraft with superb seats and entertainment, good service and great food, this must be one of the worst managed airlines. Their internet and mobile sites are rubbish and don't try and call them or obtain any service on the ground. If you call their call centre the phone will ring for hours. If they ever answer they do so just to hang up and stop the phone from ringing. Ground staff in their offices and at check in are rude and unhelpful. Their airmiles program is an unusable joke. Alll these experiences occurred on just the one flight - of many I've had recently. Brand new 777 and the seat was broken. Sat upright all the way from London to Kuwait - on a $5000 business class ticket. No apologies from management, even though the staff on the plane tried to accommodate - but plane was completely full. I had tried to upgrade before using miles, but even though I have lots of miles they are completely unusable under new rules that ban upgrades on new planes. I also had to try and change the ticket - it took days of phoning and eventually I had to go into an office which was a horrible experience with rude staff who could not have been more unhelpful and arrogant. At check-in there was complete and utter chaos. The plane took off four hours late (which is in fact not much of a delay for this airline which has the worst flight management on the planet). Anything to do with the management and ground operations and maintenance of this airline is a complete and utter joke or nightmare, depending on the day.

### "staff on return were much better"
Bangalore to Kuwait. After enduring their tatty planes for years, I landed the chance to fly their new A320s on a trip from Bangalore. The aircraft was fresh, the IFE worked and flights were on time - but the crew on the outbound r were rude and horrendous. Snapping back at passengers, disappearing for hours at a time and not answering call buttons. Thankfully, staff on the return were much better albeit very slow with the meal service on the overnight flight when you ideally want to finish dining and sleep. Overall, new planes are nice but there's more to satisfying a customer than just that.

### "much improvement to think about"
Kuwait Airways has the worst airplane i've ever seen (there are still ashtrays integrated in the seats). The seats are in an awful state. Regarding entertainment from Manila to London via Kuwait, good luck. They propose you either to sleep or to eat. There are no TV working there. The staff working inside the plane are quite nice with the passengers but seem to deal with the means they have unfortunately. Also, regarding their digitalisation, they just don't know what this is. Good luck if you want to do you check in online (I tried several times). Moreover, in terms of customer service, they are in the past. I've kindly asked for a solution in order to change my flight as there was an earlier departure than the one i'be booked, they literally just said no. Which I found really funny and didn't try to go further as it's not normal to respond this way to a customer (or ex-customer now). In a nutshell, Kuwait Airways is trying to be a flight company, but they are just trying - so much improvement to think about.

### "the worst flight I have been on"
The flight from Manila to Kuwait was the worst flight I have been on. I have been on a lot of long-haul flights but this is my first time with Kuwait Airways. The aircraft from Kuwait to London was by far superior and slightly better service. On all flights the aircraft was cold (even more so on the old planes), we asked for blankets and were told they do not supply them (even though their inflight magazine claims they do). I always wrap up warm on a flight but this was unbearable. On the London to Kuwait flight we were given a menu which had a vegetarian option. However, on the return flight as we were at the back they had run out of the vegetarian options and so I was unable to have a main meal, it was also over 4 hours into the flight before we were given food and drinks were only offered twice on the flight (unacceptable for a 7 hour flight especially when you are not even allowed to bring on water brought at the airport. The flights between Kuwait and Manila had no vegetarian option, when I questioned this the staff very rudely replied that it isn't normal for them to have to cater for vegetarians. I therefore asked for some cheese so that I wasn't limited to just eating bread and butter. On the way there they were reluctant to give me any and had to ask 3 different people before I got any. The staff on the return were more helpful. It is a 8/9 hours flight between Kuwait and Manila, on both legs our entertainment system was broken and we were unable to watch movies or listen to music. My seat was broken and didn't lean back. The flight was also severely delayed from Kuwait to Manila with no apology or proper food or drink offered to us. Their website is not user friendly and we were unable to check in online. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "Huge improvement overall"
Flew from London to Kuwait. Huge improvement overall. A sudden leap into a completely different realm. The new 777's are beautiful, not only in terms of superb interiors that make these planes now by far the most comfortable rides in and out of Kuwait in terms of hard-product (they used to be the worst imaginable experience) but even the new livery seems to have the flight crew smiling and the pilots looking proud. The food and service on Kuwait Airways was actually always quite good, but served in the dismal surroundings that used to depress the whole experience they could not shine as well as on these recent flights on the 777 that I have had. Even the front end of their internet site now looks like its in this century. Behind the scenes there is still a lot of work to be done. For example, I am flying again tomorrow to London on the same KU flights, but the contact centre still remains as before completely uncontactable, incredibly unhelpful when you do find a way past their systems to prevent contact, and behind the much better front of their internet site their is very little you can do to manage your booking. You still find yourself being arbitrarily moved from seats you may have reserved, find it impossible to upgrade your ticket even if you are willing to pay extra to do so (clearly commerciality has not sunk in yet) and you really don't yet get the feeling that the customer matter very much. But for the considerations in the last paragraph I would, unbelievably, be giving the airline a good 7-9 rating now (compared to the 0-1 it over-deserved before) but it needs to pick up on the back-office and mid-mangement support to get there as a complete product. For this reason its probably around the same level as BA or KLM now as a 5 (even though its planes are now much better than either of the other two that operate out of Kuwait to Europe). There is really no reason it could not ultimately approach the levels of other airlines in the region as an 8/9 rated carrier.

### "much better than expected"
Flew Kuwait Airways from New York JFK to Ahmedabad via Kuwait and then back to JFK via Kuwait and Shannon. I was pleasantly surprised to find the aircraft much better than expected, it was clean with adequate legroom, big screen and comfortable seats. The airline didn’t provide blankets. The crew were professional and food options decent. The movie selection was decent with a selection of games for the kids. There was also a plug to charge your electronics. The flight from Shannon to JFK also provided an option to purchase WiFi. Getting in to the Kuwait airport was little bit disorganized but once you get past the entrance, the airport had decent selection for food including two Starbucks.

### "much better than expected"
Flew from Ahmedabad to Istanbul via Kuwait. I found the airline to be much better than expected, having read some bad reviews. The aircraft's were like new inside with PTVs and comfortable seats with adaptable headrests and foodrests. There was a good choice of movies, games and a moving map and they have two cameras for watching the takeoff or the scenery. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. Also, the baggage allowance was very large - something like 30kg or more. Both flights were on A320s and the food was different on each. On the first there was a choice of omlette or paratha and on the second the choice was between chicken shish kebab or fish. All were good and came with tea/coffee and a wide range of fruit juices or other drinks. At Ahmedabad airport, they checked us in quickly for both flights without any hassle and checked our luggage through to Istanbul. As we had both boarding passes already we didn't have to do anything in Kuwait except go to the next gate. Kuwait Airport itself is OK but nothing special. The signage is bad and it´s a bit disorganised. Also, there is a severe lack of toilets for no apparent reason. It has a reasonable selection of places to eat and a few lounges that you can pay for if you want. The seats are comfortable enough to sleep on but I'd advise to take a pillow, a blanket, an eye cover and ear plugs because otherwise the bright lights and noise will keep you awake. It's busy all through the night with lots of flights arriving and departing. If you stay over 8 hours you can get a free stay in the transit hotel. If you stay for less than that then they give you a voucher for a sandwhich and a drink. To take advantage of either of these benefits you have go and ask at the transit desk (to find this, ask at the information counter where for the Kuwait Airways transit desk as you will never find it otherwise. It´s hidden away inside one of the gates). All the flights were on time and the price was the cheapest amongst all of the options from India to Turkey on these dates. I recommend to try it out and to stop in Kuwait if you have the time. It looks like an interesting place!

### "excellent price and service"
London to Manila via Kuwait. I have to say that they offered a very comfortable and pleasant service. The aircraft used were from the new fleet from London to Kuwait, and older 777 from Kuwait to Manila, same for the return flights. The staff were very polite and efficient. The food was ok, and of the same standard I have experienced on other airlines. The flights were delayed But this was not due to the airline but due to the security checks at both Manila and Kuwait. They offered and excellent price and service.

### "such a horrible experience for them"
London to Cochin via Kuwait. My parents travelled in these flights on April 2nd 2017. We had requested online for a wheelchair which was confirmed and also told the staff at airport that they need wheelchairs. They used the wheel chair in London. But when they reached Kuwait the staff refused to give them a wheelchair. Their flight time had changed and this was not informed at London. They had problems with language as well. They were "shooed" away and shouted at, asked to find their way in an unknown place. Is this the way you treat your elders? It was such a horrible experience for them. I will not recommend Kuwait airways for anyone. If you want your parents reach home safely find another airline. My parents were lucky to have a fellow passenger to help them.

### "my overall experience was quite good"
Flew Kuwait Airways from Frankfurt to Bangkok. Despite some poor reviews my overall experience was quite good and did not differ much from experiences with other middle eastern carriers. The aircrafts were new and offered the usual onboard entertainment, however movie choice was limited and was missing new movies and blockbusters. Especially disappointing was the fact that the movie offering did not change from February to March, since I was hoping to see some other movies on the flight home. Food was good, only the drinks selection left room for desire, but that is what you get when flying with an airline from a country that bans alcohol. They also could have offered drinks more frequently.

### "service by the crew was faultless"
London to Manila via Kuwait. New aircraft from London to Kuwait return. Service excellent and food not bad. Toilet on LHR-KWI had tissues all over the floor but due to passengers on this sector behaving badly. Kuwait to Manila, toilets were clean and nobody. Price was the lowest at that time and flight was not bad. Quick transfer at Kuwait to Manila but a 5 hour layover from Manila to London in Kuwait. Snack provided at Kuwait transit lounge. Looking forward when they replace their old A340 this year but service given by the crew was faultless. 5 luggages checked in, 5 claimed at destination in good order.

### "overall experience was good"
New York JFK to Delhi via Kuwait. The aircraft (Boeing 777) were new and very comfortable. Earlier, I had gone through reviews about KU and was tense for its timings and food. However, the food is good, the flights were on time or even before time. Toilets were clean. The overall experience with Kuwait Airways was good.

### "for the price it did the job"
Bangkok to Jeddah via Kuwait. Cheap and very cheerful. For the price it did the job and the total delay was only two hours by the end of the trip. The A340 is dated, worn seats, military coloured seats, non functioning entertainment system, smelly toilets, dirty toilets, no soap in toilets. No corporate identity. Military style cabin crew on second leg, first leg just lazy staff who did their best to avoid work. Minimal information. Haphazard connection in Kuwait probably because we had to get back on the exact same dirty aeroplane which caused congestion at Gate 22. Positives were smooth landings both legs. No corporate ambience music to irritate. Use if desperate - I paid GBP 380 for a single 24 hours prior.

### "food was awful and tasteless"
New York JFK to Ahmedabad via Kuwait with Kuwait Airways. The worst traveling experience I've had. The 12 hour flight was like hell. My seat didn't recline at all and the on board service was one of the worst of its kind. The food was awful and tasteless. The crew was arrogant and intentionally unhelpful. No onboard entertainment which made the journey more cumbersome. Would never pick this airline for any further travel.

### "would fly again with them"
Munich to Islamabad return via Kuwait. Every thing was smooth, I was carrying even a bit extra weight and they allowed this. Since I had a delay of one day they gave me complementary hotel, and I relaxed in Kuwait before my flight to Islamabad. The flight was on time and everything worked fine. The food is good quality and the leg space was also good since I am around 6ft tall. The return flight was also great, delayed around 1.5 hours but staff was quiet communicative and explained the situation. I will recommend it and would fly again with them.

### "the worst flying experience"
I flew Business Class from New York-Kuwait-Ahmedabad return with Kuwait Airways. These flights were the worst flights I've ever taken, and I travel internationally several times a year for the past 20 years. The misery started right after takeoff. I normally take Business class because due to a herniated disc I'm unable to sit up for long periods of time, and need to lie down when my back starts to hurt. However, these seats didn't recline all the way - they only reclined as much as a standard Economy seat. As this seat didn't recline fully, I suffered for the majority of my flight on both ways. There was no personal inflight entertainment for entirety of international flight in either direction, which is practically unheard of in today's era of flying, especially in Business Class. While entertainment was shown in the cabin-top screens, the headphones provided did not work and crew was unable to get the headphones to work, so no entertainment was available for me for either segment of my flight. Food from JFK to Kuwait was atrocious - I was provided just boiled veggies, which was tasteless, soggy and practically inedible, and the crew did not have any other vegetarian option. This is the only time when the return flight was marginally better, as the food was at least edible this time. I can say without a doubt this was the worst flying experience of my life, and it happened in Business Class.

### "lots of confusion"
Flew Kuwait Airways from New York JFK to Bangalore via Kuwait. Really poor service with old planes. The personal TVs don't work. On long flights one would imagine that they would ensure that the TVs work. Their boarding procedures are very unorganized. Lots of confusion. Also the cabin crew arrived late.

### "very satisfied of my flights"
I travelled Kuwait Airways for the first time last week as they have opened a route between Kuwait and Paris. The seats in business class are very confortable, the service was exceptional (it's a dry airline) and there were no delay. The crew were very welcoming and professional. One thing was missing during the flight, an amenity kit. Compared to other major gulf carriers, Kuwait Airways has to improve for sure. I was very satisfied of my flights with them and would recommand to fly with them.

### "a lot delays and poor service"
Cheap price, but it is not worth it. You pay a cheap fare for the ticket which comes with a lot delays and poor service. I flew from Canada to London Heathrow with Air Canada and from London Heathrow to Dhaka via Kuwait. All flights were delayed, the service was very bad and the cabin crew didn't reply to questions. Kuwait Airways did not have much inflight entertainment or blankets. The food was good though. From Kuwait to Dhaka the flight was simply disaster, a 4 hour delay where I was waiting onboard the plane for 2.5 hours. On my return to Canada, the flight from Dhaka was delayed for 4 hours which made me miss my all connecting flights. I had to stay in a hotel in Kuwait for 14 hours and they wanted me to share a room with someone else. If you refuse the answer will be simply, go and wait at the airport. Overall, they don't seem to care about their customers.

### "will never fly Kuwait Airways"
I had an e-ticket for the flight from New York JFK to Bangalore via Kuwait for Sunday Oct 30th. On reaching the airport, after a 2 hour cab ride, I was told that the flights schedule had been changed to Mondays. They told me its no big deal, just come back tomorrow. There were 19 other ticket holders like me at the airport holding their heads in their hands in disbelief. I had a long discussion with Kuwait Airways at JFK and they assured me I could take the same flight the next day, however the next day I was told that there was no 2nd leg from Kuwait to Bangalore. I ended up initiating a cancellation after talking to Kuwait customer service and I was assured a cancellation would result in a complete refund of fare. Its been 15 days and I haven't received my refund. I had to buy a new ticket for $800 at the last min and fly via Etihad so I would not miss another day of work. I was never notified of this schedule change and my multiple emails to them have come back with no response. Its like screaming at a wall. Trust me, you deserve better. I will never fly Kuwait Airways.

### "think twice before buying a ticket"
Madras to New York JFK return via Kuwait was my first time flying with Kuwait airways. The flight from Madras to Kuwait return (A340) was okay compared to the flight from Kuwait to New York return on a B747. There is no working in flight entertainment system for the flight to and fro NY though they had a small screen in front. Bad/broken seats, some of the staff are quite rude. The KWI-JFK flight landing at Shannon (Ireland) Airport came as a surprise for many of my co-passengers since it wasn't clearly mentioned in the ticket that there would be a stop in Dublin. There was also a delay in the flight from KWI-JFK. The passengers weren't explained why there was a delay. Security check done, bus is waiting downstairs, no passengers coming in to the gate, no work for almost 40-50 mins approx. I supposed they were waiting to pickup few other passengers from their other destinations and flights may have been delayed. There were no restrooms after the security check within the gate. Some of them were waiting to use the restroom at the flight. Since the flight was delayed, if they should use the restroom outside the lounge area of the gate they had to go through the whole process again. It caused big inconvenience to many. I think the flight is pretty much okay of it is your first time to fly and Kuwait Airways is your first ever company that you are flying with. For frequent fliers or for those who had already flown with other airlines it's a nightmare, at least to JFK which is their only destination in the US. Unlike their other services, exceptionally their food was good. Think twice before buying a ticket with them.

### "round trip a complete farce"
New York to Lahore via Kuwait with Kuwait Airways. Starting flight from JFK, to pretty much non-functional inflight entertainment systems, to rude and incompetent booking and flight crew, and delayed flight coming back to New York, the round trip was a complete farce. My flight was from New York, via London (not mentioned in flight schedule) and Kuwait. On my way to Lahore, the flight was delayed by almost 2.5 hours from JFK. The flight going from JFK to London had a couple of rude air hostesses who sneered or showed a very passive aggressive behavior. Kuwait Airport was probably one of the worst managed airports with information very hard to get. The behavior of immigration staff was awful. My flight landed in Lahore a total of 3 hours later and on my way back to New York, I had yet another delay for over 3 hours. Inflight entertainment didn't work, airline didn't have enough blankets to pass around. Food was decent. Not so good for vegetarians. Overall, you get what you pay for, sure. But some airlines are cheaper than others. Don't even bother about their first class or business class, you can get better service for just slightly more with other middle eastern carriers. I do not recommend this service at any cost.

### "pleased with my experience"
Bangalore to Istanbul via Kuwait with Kuwait Airways. Got a return trip for less than 25k and was little worried after reading the reviews but the entire journey proved my instinct totally wrong. The route from Bangalore to Kuwait and to Istanbul and return was pleasant with new aircraft, good food, nice cabin crew and inflight entertainment. One small thing that I felt could have been better was the headphones provided inflight. They were kinda cheap and couldn't listen to movies during the flight after keeping volume to max. Kuwait airport was also a good experience as opposed to all the negative reviews. I guess all reviews are subjective and I was pleased with my experience which was rather a pleasant one.

### "round trip a complete farce"
New York to Dhaka via Kuwait. Starting from the delayed flight from JFK, to pretty much non-functional in-flight entertainment systems, to rude and incompetent flight crew, and delayed flight coming back to New York, the round trip was a complete farce. Our flight to Dhaka was from New York, via London, via Kuwait to Dhaka. Our flight back was supposed to be from Dhaka, via Kuwait, to JFK. On our way to Dhaka, the flight was delayed by almost 2.5 hours from JFK. The flight going from JFK to London had a couple of rude air hostesses who sneered or showed a very passive aggressive behavior. Kuwait Airport was probably one of the worst managed airports with information very hard to get. It took me until Kuwait Airport to realize why some of these flight-staff and airport staff were so rude to me and my wife. There's a big Bangladeshi migrant blue collar work force in Kuwait, but unfortunately airport and some in-flight staff seem to judge everyone from a very generic view. Our flight landed in Dhaka a total of 3 hours later and on our way back to New York, we had yet another delay for over 3 hours. Inflight entertainment didn't work, airline didn't have enough blankets to pass around (my wife was told that she will only be given a blanket after the elderly and the kids were accounted for. Why doesn't the airplane carry a blanket for every passenger? Other airlines aren't like this). Food was decent. Not so good for vegetarians. Overall, you get what you pay for, sure. But some airlines are cheaper than others. Don't even bother about their first class or business class, you can get better service for just slightly more with other middle eastern carriers.

### "a high quality of service"
Rome to Colombo via Kuwait. A superb A330 flight, staff provide a high quality of service to the passengers. The seats were very comfortable, and the in-flight entertainment system is fantastic. WIFI facility on-board which helped me to check my mails. As a family we had a pleasant journey throughout the flight.

### "3 times the flight was delayed"
Jeddah to Colombo via Kuwait with Kuwait Airways. First of all they never follow their timing - I have flown 3 times with Kuwait Airways and these 3 times the flight was delayed more that 2 hours. The cabin crew is worst and they treat people in a very rude way. I believe their job is to serve passangers and guide them instead showing attitude. My journey was nearly 6 hours and the screen infront of me did not work and I notice all the screens in economy class were not working. The food was horrible.

### "expected delay 24 hours"
New York to Chennai via London and Kuwait with Kuwait Airwyas. I chose this flight for the low cost and short travel time. Aircraft interiors are old. TV wasn't working. Lavatory is not cleaned. Food is ok. Flight started with a 2 hours delay. In London we were delayed by another 1 hour. Reached Kuwait by total 4 hours delayed. I missed the flight to Chennai due to that. The airline arranged my travel for the next day's flight at the same time. Expected delay 24 hours. I lost 1 day of my holiday. I am worried about my return travel, better to book a reputed airlines - I do not recommend.

### "will never recommend this"
New Delhi to New York JFK via Kuwait. Very poor quality, will never recommend this to anyone. Throughout the flight the entertainment system did not work. The food quality was poor from New Delhi to Kuwait and Shannon Airport (Ireland) to JFK. One stop added (Ireland) post booking tickets due to which there was a delay of 3 hours. At the added second stop there was a delay of another 2 hours. So the total delay was 5 hours.

### "do not recommend Kuwait Airways"
Dubai to Cairo via Kuwqait. For some reason, Kuwait Airways flights are late. Food and beverage are poor, and entertainment is zero in some flights. Seats are okay but old, cabin crew are helpful and understanding. I do not recommend Kuwait Airways.

### "cheap but I do not recommend"
I travelled from London Heathrow to colombo via Kuwait with Kuwait Airways - the expericance was horrible. The aircraft was old, none of the PTV screens worked, the staff were very rude and they had no blankets at all. The flight was delayed by 3 hours. All passengers were stuck in the aircraft for that long and it was over 30 degrees - all they did was give out water. Even though the tickets are cheap I do not recommend this airline - their service is not good at all.

### "cheap tickets but I don't recommend"
London Heathrow to Colombo via Kuwait with Kuwait Airlines. The aircraft was old and there was a delay of over 2.5 hours as the flight was held for connecting passengers. The fabric of the seats was worn and it was hot in the aircraft - they did not start the engine to save fuel. As such all passengers were boiling for 2.5 hours. Return journey, same as above. Over and above this, the cabin crew was very rude to a lot of people, especially an elderly couple and another elderly gentleman travelling alone. Even though they offer cheap tickets I don't recommend if you don't have time to spare.

### "a forgettable experience"
This was our return flight from NY to Mumbai with a stopover and plane change at Kuwait. For an 12 hour long flight from NY to Kuwait this airline had no inflight entertainment. The screens were there but we were told that it is not working. When we asked for blankets we were told that they had blankets for only about 20% of passengers and no more were available. Overall the crew  did not show any warmth towards the passengers, and a forgettable experience. Will never fly Kuwait Airways again.

### "reason for flying was cheap fare"
New York JFK to Delhi via London and Kuwait. Flight delay at JFK by about 45 minutes, no announcements at airport so advised to stay close to gates. I had read reviews for poor service but the 24 year old A340 was ok condition. Old seats with non working monitors but seat space is good. Staff good at services. I had booked AVML so special meal was served. JFK-LHR sector had one set of crew. Deplaned at LHR, went through whole terminal and screening to board same aircraft after 1 hour. The new crew was attentive and service was good. Again no inflight entertainment and no alcohol as per Kuwait airways policy. Both sectors were almost 6-7 hours long so carry your Ipad, music with you. At Kuwait stopover of 3 hours, airport is crowded and almost no place to sit. No wifi. Again a long boarding queue, another A340 similar 24 year old aircraft without entertainment system. Again crew was helpful but passengers were noisy. The only reason for flying Kuwait Airways was cheap fare. If you are happy going from point A to B in old aircraft but with good service, then go for it. The food was reasonable both in quantity and quality.

### "plane looked new and clean"
Nice surprise. I flew with Kuwait Airways yesterday from London Heathrow to Kuwait for the first time. Normally I would fly BA but the price went up so had to take a cheaper option with Kuwait Airways, as its a work trip I didn't have an option to postpone so booked the flight. When I arrived my pre booked seat was changed (no shock I had read this happens) but they moved me to another window seat, so no issues. The plane looked new and was very clean with a very good entertainment setup. When I boarded my original seat had been turned to a bed for a medical transport so this also is a reason I would happily move seat for. The inflight service was good, the food was better than most I have had so my experience of this trip has left me thinking reviews are a little harsh. This said, I am aware they will have many planes and staff so maybe I was lucky - I will see on the return leg but so far so good.

### "to be completely ignored"
We flew London Heathrow to Kuwait with Kuwait Airways, only to find on arrival they had damaged my 6 year old, disabled daughter's wheelchair. We logged a complaint and were issued with an incident reference number. However no further assistance was provided whilst we were stranded in a foreign country, rendered immobile as a family. We have written to them to complain, only to be completely ignored. This is the worst case of customer neglects and lack of human care (especially where a child is concerned) that I have ever encountered. Do not fly with that airline!

### "exceeded my expectations"
Bangalore to Istanbul via Kuwait, and Kuwait Airways exceeded my expectations. The aircraft were new and clean with good leg space and Inflight Entertainment Screens working. Improved behaviour on the staff, and I could see the improvements. I was surprised when they announced that the Istanbul to Kuwait aircraft had a Inflight WiFi feature and we can buy the services thru Credit Card. Food was okay. If you find a good deal you can travel with it I can see that they are trying to improve and thats visible.

### "old aircraft, uncomfortable seats"
Heathrow to Colombo via Kuwait with Kuwait Airways - the first flight was on time. Kuwait to Colombo flight was delayed by 3 hours and when we enquired we were given a meal ticket to the so called "Restaurant" which handed out sandwiches that were not edible. Kuwait to Colombo was on an old plane which was uncomfortable and the staff were rude. Due to the delay, we missed the SriLankan Airlines flight from Colombo to Trivandrum with the visa fees and flight tickets going to a waste as we decided to stay in Sri Lanka until the end of our trip. Luckily they give out arrival visas in Colombo. Our journey back was a nightmare too with the flight delayed for over 2.5 hours from Colombo. The same old aircraft with uncomfortable seats. The flight to and from Kuwait to London was on time with a newer aircraft and a bit more comfortable. Will never fly with Kuwait Airways again.

### "impressed by Kuwait Airways"
Rome to Paris. Missed my Alitalia flight and rebooked with Kuwait the same day as it was the only affordable ticket. Kuwait Airways has been a good surprise for me but it doesn't need much to be better than Alitalia. Anyway, considering the plane was coming from Kuwait our seats were clean. There was a lot of space and the entertainment onboard was good. Seats were new as well as the plane itself. We were served water together with refreshing towels and a lunchbox which was not bad at all. The crew was polite and toilets very clean. . I know this is a routine but I was so impressed by Kuwait Airways.

### "one of the worst airlines"
London to Ahmedabad via Kuwait. Kuwait Airways was one of the worst airlines traveled. The flight was delayed from the first take off. Flight was suppose to land at Ahembabad Airport at 4:30 am but landed at 6:30 am. The food in the flight was bland, even though selecting food services did not get the requested food. We had selected the specific seats as per requirements but it was not given and seats numbers were written manually on boarding passes from Kuwait. Inflight Entertainment system was not working from London to Kuwait. Departing from Kuwait flight was suppose to depart at 5:30 am but departed at 8:20am. Seats are not comfortable and clean as it should be. Kuwait airport staff are very rude.

### "worst airline I have flown"
I usually don't write reviews, but Kuwait airways deserves this honor for being the worst airline I have flown in recent times. I was flying to New York from Mumbai via Kuwait which is close to 21 hour journey. The seats in economy were in such a horrible condition I was afraid I would catch something from it. The inflight entertainment did not work and when I asked the flight attendant they told me that they were old and don't work all the time. How about I decide not to pay the full price for ticket sometimes? The next disaster was when the meals were served. I ate chicken for first meal and for second one I requested vegetarian. The flight attendant told me they didn't have vegetarian food - only to find out he did not want to go all the way back and get one for me. Few rows back I saw him serve vegetarian dish after refill. Its just sad how they lost a customer specially on such important route. I recommend to avoid Kuwait airways on this route.

### "indifference to passenger needs"
Mumbai to New York JFK and back with Kuwait Airways - I'm really disappointed to say that although they are quite reasonably priced, the quality of product and service offered is poor. No inflight entertainment, no staff assistance, no reading lights. The crew were outright rude and they literally bark at customers. It was a horrible
experience - I'd rather not travel if I can't afford another airline. It looked like the crew did not like their job - you cannot be in a service industry and observe this kind of indifference to passenger needs.

### "cheapest flight available"
Kuala Lumpur to New York JFK via Kuwait. My thoughts on Kuwait Airways are pretty mixed. The cheapest flight available from Kuala Lumpur to JFK (about $390 one way) which is a big pro in my opinion but it also explains why the airline sucks in so many other ways - staff were friendly, we missed the connection in Kuwait and were put in decent hotel for the night. However, no working in flight entertainment on either of the flights, very little leg room (though one flight was rather empty and I could lie down). Since my connection to JFK was missed and I had to fly the next day, I missed by bus connection to Pittsburgh from JFK. Kuwait Airways would not even consider reimbursing, even though the flight was a day late and the bus fee was minimal. Give yourself at least a day in between your ETA and your next flight if you are using a different airline for your next flight, or else you will be screwed and Kuwait Airways won't help. You'll also lose any money you thought you were saving from going with this cheap airline.

### "not travel with them again"
Condition of the Kuwait Airways aircraft from London to Kuwait was disgraceful for an international airline. I could not recline the seat, entertainment system did not work, reading light was burnt out. Seat was compacted like a sandwich. From Kuwait to Colombo, shortly after take off we had an emergency landing in a remote airport in Dubai. We were stranded for over 15 hours with hamburgers. Passengers including young families and old people were treated with contempt as we have become a burden to them. No one took responsibility for our welfare left on the hard seats of the airport until they were ready. Aircraft was not airworthy and they decided to replace it with another aircraft from Kuwait to continue the flight to Colombo. I would not travel with them again.

### "polite attentive crew"
Bangkok to Manila return. Service was quite good with a full meal service both ways and polite attentive crew. The planes were near new A330's and both flights were on time. The entertainment system had a large selection of movies, TV and music.

### "would fly with them again"
My flight was from Rome to Bangkok with stops in Kuwait and I was due to fly an old A340. Instead, they are replacing many aircraft and in my journey I found myself with the A330-200 which are just six months old. The food was normal and pleasant staff. If I only base myself on this experience I would fly with them again.

### "a seven hour delay"
We, four pensioners, experienced a seven hour delay from Heathrow on Kuwait Airways, with times of departure constantly moving backwards. We arrived in JFK, missed our onwards travel mode and spend two full days recovering. The plane was old, no TV'S, no snack service, even worse no alcohol. If I was flying around the Middle East fair enough but London to New York. No response to emails, no one answering the phone at their customer services so I'm really in the mood to give these a blank for everything, (I can't). I understand the service KU101 is frequently late, has poor service and expect a cattle truck mentality.

### "never recommend this airline"
I travelled from New York JFK to Kuwait via London return in Nov. 2015. The flight was disgusting with no in flight TV service working; not even the airshow map. I had to turn my own timer on Iphone in order to keep a track of how many hours are left to destination. The food was poor and no snacks were provided in the long flight. The crew did not provide any blankets and kept saying that they do not have enough blankets for every passenger. The crew was also rude. The seats were very uncomfortable. I would never recommend this airline on this route. It seemed as if I was travelling in a 1960 aircraft.

### "everything was wrong"
London Heathrow to New York JFK with Kuwait Airways and everything was wrong! Flight was delayed both ways, with no communication as to when we would be leaving. The security was slack to say the least. The inflight entertainment didn't work, seat was broken so didn't go back so was completely upright. Staff were rude and abrupt and they never checked if seat belts were on.

### "all 3 of us were separated"
I will never choose to fly with Kuwait Airways again. The flight was horrible. I was travelling with my 2 year old who was scared to sit on his own seat, so when I asked the cabin crew for another seatbelt she said "he has to sit on his own, sorry". After a lot of explaining finally we were given another seatbelt. The staff were rude on both our flights. I don't understand the point of providing 'in-flight entertainment magazines' when their screens never work. The in-flight entertainment doesn't exist. Meals were horrible, no options because they ran out. On our return flight we did online check-in as we were travelling with a child but as we got to the boarding gates we were told our seats had been changed and all 3 of us were separated. How is it possible that an airline crew doesn't know if a child is travelling with an adult when the seats were already booked? How is it possible to leave a 2 year old on his own among strangers? When we asked the crew to seat us together they weren't bothered at all instead they said "sit in the given seats and once we take off we will sort your seats" we refused and sorted it by swapping seats with another passenger. Awful. Absolutely awful.

### "dreading the flight home"
Flew from Heathrow to JFK in mid October. The food was quite tasty and the flight staff were mostly friendly. Seats were fine, comfortable enough for economy. The price was reasonable, GBP355 return. The flight was delayed by 5 hours. The staff member who checked us in didn't tell us - we had to go back and ask after realising we'd been given £15 food vouchers without any explanation The staff member who was directing passengers to the gate was incredibly rude and condescending - especially to customers whose first language was not English. The inflight entertainment system did not work (this looked to be the case for over 90% of the passengers onboard). One of the male stewards singled me out for special attention throughout the flight (bringing the drinks cart to me first, dropping off treats at random times), which was nice enough at first but got a bit uncomfortable as the flight went on. Overall I would not recommend this airline, and dreading the flight home, put a bit of a dampener on the holiday.

### "lack of security terrifying"
London to Trivandrum via Kuwait return. I cannot express enough how bad every single stage of this journey with Kuwait Airways was! The first leg from London to Kuwait was on a very aged aircraft, on which the main lights worked intermittently leading to eating our meal in the dark. The inflight entertainment screens did not work for a single passenger on any of the 4 flights I took with them. The meals were pretty bad and they ran out of all options but one, before they were halfway up the plane. The seats are so uncomfortable and an extra chair was bolted in to most planes. The staff looked more like they had lost the will to live than me. Kuwait Airport is a joke, the screens went from no information to final call for every flight, leading to a rush to get on the plane. Every flight was at least an hour delayed, the worst was 3hrs due to nothing other than complete disorganisation. The lack of security for flight transfers at Kuwait Airport was nothing short of terrifying. At one point the staff left the box of confiscated knives open in the airside waiting room, whilst the woman who was supposed to watching the bags being scanned, was on her phone. We accidentally got several bottles of water and mosquito repellent through without her noticing. The flights weren't even cheap, we had to pay again and re-book the flights a few days before travelling as the re-seller we used to buy the tickets hadn't ever done so. If you are tempted by low prices I implore you to pay a bit more and travel another airline!

### "vegetarian food request met"
New Delhi to JFK via Kuwait on Kuwait Airways. The food was as requested and my wife's request to have vegetarian food was also met. The inflight entertainment worked fine on flight from Delhi to Kuwait but not from Kuwait to JFK. Another problem was the absence of seating arrangement at Kuwait Airport. The flight attendants provided water and special requests for juice or coffee were also met.

### "didn't get served my food"
Heathrow to New York JFK return with Kuwait Airways. Reclining chair was not working and tv was not working. The staff weren't very warm, to the point of being rude. I didn't get served my food, and when I asked for my food they gave it to me reluctantly as if I was trying to get second servings. I didn't receive water that came with the meal which everyone else received. Our flight was delayed 6 hours on the way back without an explanation.

### "shocking manners of staff on board"
I flew flight KU117 from Kuwait City to JFK and reached NYC this morning, with a supposed layover of 1.5 hours in Kuwait City. This is my experience: 1) Flight from Chennai took off on time and reached Kuwait City. As soon as we landed we were all told that there was a 12 hour delay with our connecting flight and we would be provided with accommodation for that time span. Only later did I understand that there were passengers from Pakistan, Trivandrum, Ahmedabad all of who were supposed to fly to JFK stuck in Kuwait City for over a day. This was probably because the flights were under-booked and they probably didn't want to operate that route. 2) Flight information was not updated anywhere (not even on their own website). My family didn't know where I was, whether my flight had taken off or when I would land. The customer service number listed on their website is not functional. 3) Absolutely shocking manners of the staff on board. I had to almost plead for water and then the air hostess serves me breakfast and says - here is your water. This was almost 30 mins after I requested it. When I asked for water again, I was told there was some at the back and I could walk over to get it. Plus, I had mentioned that I am a vegetarian while booking tickets and yet was served a turkey sandwich. 4) No blankets or pillows for anyone. People were freezing and none were distributed. Reconsidering switching to another airline for my return trip.

### "the worst flying experience"
Sometimes going for the cheapest available fare can really bite one. Kuwait Airways is a prime example - my flight from New York to Ahmedabad for $490 one way sounded too good to be true and it was. Rudest flight attendants. Horrible food, even by airline standards. No flight entertainment at all because none of the TVs worked. No seating at the Kuwait Airport during my layover. It was like musical chairs. The flight reached on time. All in all, this was the worst flying experience.

### "I was placed on standby"
I had booked my Kuwait Airways ticket online 4 months back, but on the day of the flight found that I was placed on standby, together with a host of other passengers on that sector. Waited at the airport for 3 hours during which time none of the airline ground staff offered an explanation of what was going on. Finally managed to talk to the Ops manager who kept assuring us seats on the next days flight. Tried to get them to issue a boarding pass for the next day's flight, but they did not oblige. Waited for another 3 hours before they offered us just 15Kg excess baggage allowance with a validity of 1 year. The norm is to offer an open ticket or cash compensation - none was offered. Had to check in 8 hours before flight the next day to get an assurance of a seat. The ground staff at Kuwait Airport have no notion of Customer Service and are not bothered if the customer is satisfied with their service.

### "unacceptable customer service"
London to Colombo via Kuwait. Me and my wife flew back in 15 Oct 2015. flight returned because of mechanical fault and had an emergency landing. We landed after 1 hour flight time but left in Heathrow airport remote location with no water no food about 5 hours. Then we were taken back to a hotel room and asked to come back next day. They promised a flight on 16th at 10.15 pm and asked us to return to the hotel. Customer service crew was very unhelpful and rude and we were treated like it was our fault. On the 16th when we turn up for the rescheduled flight there was no flight booked under our name and we were stranded in the airport all evening, and there were no Kuwait staff to take care of this. 17th we been asked to come and they booked us at Qatar Airways, but when they transferred us they booked us 30kg on Qatar (we had 50kg on Kuwait Airways) and the Kuwait Airways supervisor refused to pay the excesses and asked us to bear the costs. This was very unacceptable customer service.

### "don't use Kuwait Airways"
London Heathrow to New York JFK return with Kuwait Airways. Let's start with punctuality, 2hr delay on the first leg to JFK then 1hr delay on second leg 5 days later back to Heathrow. On the second leg we were given no information about the delay or how long it was expected to be - even the Pilot was standing around 20 minutes with his crew before they left. Once your plane arrives late you all form a queue. Then they call seats x to x which causes chaos as the orderly queue becomes a push and rush to the front everyone trying to board even if their rows not called this is known as a 'bottleneck'. Now finally on the plane, the staff are rude laughing and joking amongst themselves and not attending passengers. None of the electronics work so you can't even call for assistance. The only time you are offered a drink is when the food comes around. You've now given up and accepted its a terrible experience and decide seen as you can't watch the inflight film as its not working, you'll try get some sleep to make time go faster - but then realise the chairs don't recline because they don't work, great stuff. The food is no better or worse than any other airline. We booked because we thought let's save money on this to give us more on our trip. This was a mistake and a lesson learned. My advice is pay the extra money and don't use Kuwait Airways - it is terrible! My rating is because they landed in the right airport safely.

### "cannot emphasise how awful it was"
The Kuwait Airways website crashed on the day of departure so no online check in possible. I called their office (only 1 office, the main one in Kuwait) and after keeping me on hold for an expensive 5 mins they cut me off inexplicably. Unexplained over 4hr wait. The plane was very old. Uniforms of staff with dirt, food, debris on them. TV and audio output not working. When I asked a steward how to complain he didn't answer me. But the heavily perfumed head steward returned later to lean over my seat and abusively demand an apology for my insulting Kuwait Airways? I add that I made absolutely no such insult other than stating those aforementioned facts (lateness - an insult to point this out?). I didn't raise my voice and to be honest was absolutely stunned when I fully expected him to be coming to apologise in person. You couldn't pay me to take that airline again. In fact i'm wasting my return ticket (which is non-refundable) and going to pay a further 500GBP just to go another airline last minute, so I don't have to set food aboard Kuwait Airways again. Cannot emphasise how awful it was.

### "again my TV was not working"
New York JFK to London Heathrow with Kuwait Airways on Sept 15, 2015. After take-off, I asked if my TV could be turned on. The flight crew told me that the TVs do not turn on automatically but should start up in 10-15 mins. 3 hours into the flight, a crew member was walking around offering headsets. I asked, if he could turn my TV on and was again told the same thing - the TVs do not turn on automatically but should start up in 10-15 mins. I told him I was told this 3 hours ago and I was told "I guess it just doesn't work then. I was cold and when I asked for a blanket, I was informed there was a limited number of blankets on the plane and did not get one. After being told to look at the menu and pick what I wanted for lunch, I was told only 1 of the 3 options was available. I asked for a sprite, "we don't have any". I asked for orange juice, "we don't have any". When I asked for water, "it's in the back. you have to wait till I can get back there. which took about 30 mins. Halfway thorugh the flight, the heat was turned up so high that I suffered a nose bleed. As this was an overnight flight, I woke up at 5am and asked for a cup of coffee. I was told "breakfast will be served in an hour. you will have to wait until then. I travel with a bad back and the seat did not recline making me travel on an overnight flight sitting upright and unable to sleep. Loose equipment, I believe it was the bathroom door or something in that section, was rattling loudly throughout the entire overnight flight. On the return flight to JFK on Oct 3, 2015, after trying to make sure with Kuwait Airways staff in Heathrow airport that I would not experience the same conditions as I did on my inbound flight on my way out, I was told I would have to send this email as they could do nothing for me, not even an upgrade for the inconvenience. Staff was very rude about it. Again, my TV was not working, a select few around the aircraft were, but in very poor quality. As this was a daytime flight, I was expecting to stay awake and watch TV. The heat was again blasting full force and surrounding passengers were also complaining about it. Nothing was done about it. Traveling with a bad back, again my seat did not recline and I was forced to sit upright for the entire flight.

### "comfort in the cabin third rate"
I m a frequent traveller on Kuwait Airways, and the only reason I choose KU is the timing -it is convenient to take flights on Thursday night and return on Sunday morning. Otherwise the comfort in the cabin is third rate - the seats do not recline properly, foot rest does not work, Inflight Entertainment comes on and off. KU announced seat sales until September 30th, and as soon as they collected money and issue tickets, they cancelled the Thursday flight schedules, leaving travellers on limbo. It is hard to believe on ticket sales from KU.

### "food served was excellent and hot"
My first time to fly Kuwait Airways, from Cairo to Kuwait. Check in was okay,  boarding was organized well. I flew their new A320, a very clean aircraft with a nice boarding music and helpful cabin crew. Very comfortable seats with PTV. The food served was excellent and hot, with  good selections of movies, tv shows, music. Wifi and mobile connective are available with charges.

### "Very poor customer service"
My 13 year old son was scheduled to fly out of JFK back to London with Kuwait Airways, got to the airport four hours ahead, it took the ground staff five hours to communicate back to passengers that the flight in question would not leave that night. Asked to see a manager to whom I explained my situation, as I was also on holiday but was booked on a different flight on a different day, as my son arrived before me and was scheduled to leave New York in two days. I was told that my son had a seat reserved for him with American Airlines the next day. We went off and arrived the next day only to be told that my son had not been booked on the flight, we were sent back to Kuwait Airways as I was now becoming very desperate. After much argument and refusing to leave, they managed to put him on a 7 hour transit flight. Very poor customer service.

### "a very unpleasant flight"
Unexplainable 7 hour delay with Kuwait Airways. No email or warning until you spend 70 bucks to get to the airport. Plane was old and not very well kept. Not dirty but it could have been conditioned better. A very unpleasant flight.

### "I do not recommend Kuwait Airways"
I booked a round trip flight from London to New York JFK with Kuwait Airways. On the first leg of the trip, the flight was delayed for 7 hours without any explanation for the delay. Although this was a bit annoying and unexpected, the airline did provide a hotel and meals, which I appreciated. My major grievance with this airline was the experience for my return flight. Upon arrival at the airport 3 hours before my scheduled departure I was told that the flight had been cancelled and that I had been rebooked on another airline. However, when I went to the new airline to check in, I was told that they did not know what I was talking about, that they had no booking for me, and that Kuwait Airways had not contacted them. I found this to be unprofessional on the part of Kuwait Airways. After literally 2 hours of back and forth and waiting in long queues, the new airline did not accept my rebooking since they were overbooked themselves, and Kuwait Airways essentially told me that they could not rebook me for that day and they could not tell me when they would be able to rebook me, and that I should wait in a hotel they were providing until they called or emailed me with my rebooking information. I found this unacceptable and asked to speak to the supervisor who was unapologetic, unsympathetic, and quite nonchalant about the situation. He eventually gave me a list of customer relations and reservations numbers for me to call and air my grievances. I returned to the airport the next morning and could not find a representative from Kuwait Airways to speak to, furthermore, none of the numbers I received worked. They either rang out or rang to a voicemail that stated that the customer services representative was on holiday and would return on a date that was earlier than the actual date, meaning that he should have been back from holiday already! I could not contact Kuwait Airways, and did not hear from them for 2 days. I eventually bought a return ticket on another airline since I had to be back in the UK in time for other travel arrangements. I did not hear from Kuwait Airways until I was already back in the UK 3 days after the flight was supposed to leave JFK. Since then, I have contacted them by email and phone to request a refund for the return flight that was not rebooked and have been unsuccessful. I know Kuwait Airways is cheap in comparison to others, but the hassle I experienced was not worth it. I would have rather paid more to be guaranteed that I would be able to travel on time and to have a better customer service experience. In the long run, choosing Kuwait Airways eventually cost me more since I ended up having to buy another return ticket anyway. Use this airline at your own risk but I do not recommend them.

### "entertainment system not working"
New York to Trivandram via Kuwait, and very poor aircraft. Pushback of the seats are not working for many. Almost 99% of entertainment system (TV) are not working. Staff are rude. When you complain about anything the answer you get is always same "You should adjust with what you have. You can't complain". Very scary part of the journey: they convert couple of rows as bed for sick people. I am so sorry that they are sick but sitting adjacent to sick people was not nice.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Gulf Air Heathrow lounge very nice and professional service. The service was excellent on the flight, cabin crew very friendly and professional. The choice of meals was very good as were the meals themselves. They offer no alcohol on this flight but for me that's not a deal breaker. Great choice of other beverages. Downsides were that the inflight entertainment wasn't operational (I had my iPad, so again didn't affect me) and the aircraft was outdated. Apart from that I will be flying them again, as they beat the likes of British Airways, Virgin and the US airlines on price.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
A nightmare trip. First flight had nearly 2 hours late. Paris airport said to us that the crew arrived late to the plane and it was true, we coud see them arrive late at boarding gate. Kuwait to Bangkok was delayed 11 hours,  all people had other connections missed them. I had to find a room late in Bangkok and wait the day after to come back the city - I live in northeast Thailand. It's like Kuwait Airways don't care about their customers.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
The flight was delayed for two hours before departure from Rome and then upon arrival at Kuwait International Airport at 20.00 (8pm) the flight to Manila with a stopover at Bangkok at 23.25 (11.25pm) was delayed until the next morning at 7.30am. I was forced to wait at the airport, they offered us food at 3am in the morning. Finally the next morning the check in started at around 7 in the morning but for some reason they decided to delay the departure at 10.00am. It was a terrible flight and wouldn't recomend it. My flight from Kuwait to Manila was delayed 10 hours and they didn't manage to offer us hotel accommodation. The food was ok, the crew were nice though the airplane inside was outdated.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
The flight was good but was outdated, the entertainment system was not working in some seats. The food was great and the crew friendly. It was good value for money.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Flew on a Boeing 777-200ER (9K-AOB). The aircraft cabin shows its age and IFE exists but is luck whether switched on or not. In my case it was on movies were in a loop system and I was so excited it was working but sadly the audio did not work. There is no point of offering good quality headsets if the IFE audio doesn't work at all. Food was of excellent quality but less portion (Ordered a vegan meal without dairy products). The cabin staff 12 of 13 were only men on this flight and service was just fair and whatever meets with minimum requirements. There is an exception of the occasional friendly crew who is nice and pleasant. Would I recommend it again? Yes! But please calculate your trips so that you fly the newer aircraft and your experience will be pleasant and enjoyable.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
LHR-JFK JFK-LHR. 777 both flights. Knew what to expect from previous reviews but mainly all I cared about was that I got there and without problems which I did. However IFE not working on either leg and neither were most other passengers. This would be ok if their phone policy was that it needed to be switched off for the duration yet I saw flight attendants using theirs. Seats had a fair bit of legroom and reclined however were quite hard. Food better than expected and quite a bit of it. Cabin crew did a lot of drink runs but be aware that they do not offer alcohol. If you can get a good price with this airline I would say it's worth it but I'm unsure if I would fly again.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Flew to Manila via Kuwait and Bangkok. Firstly our flight was delayed by an hour at Heathrow Airport. This didn't bother us too much at the time as we had no sleep the previous night so were happy to sleep off the delay and it also meant less waiting time at Kuwait for our connecting flight. Secondly my husband and I felt like we were back in the 90's with the state the plane was in. IFE was provided using very old dated TV's and my TV for all legs of the journey was not working. Next and this had to be the icing on the cake our flight from Kuwait to Manila was delayed by 8 hours! Thankfully we were provided food and a hotel room. We had to contact our relatives in Manila to cancel all plans made for us as instead of arriving at 4pm we would be arriving at midnight. On the way back from Manila to UK our flight was again delayed. We spent over an hour in the waiting lounge in Manila and another hour or so on the plane in Bangkok. My seat recline did not work for both connecting flights (Manila-Kuwait and Kuwait-UK). Again my IFE was not working. I noticed when leaving the plane flight staff were not friendly at all. As courtesy when leaving the plane I always say thank you to the staff and the response I received was a head nod. With all these bad experiences the positivity I can offer is that Kuwait Airways do take care in feeding their passengers. We must have been fed every 2 hours and the food was nice. To that I give credit to them. With that being said I don't think I'll be flying with this airline again.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Just flown to New York in both business and economy classes. I flew out to New York in business class on a free upgrade so before you read on I didn't pay for this business class flight so the value for money is going to be irrelevant. Kuwait operate their business class seating in a 2-2-2 arrangement. Seating is comfy and the room is spacious with ample arm room and a fairly decent table. As you're seated you're greeted with a drink (orange pineapple and other fruit juices) and some nuts. Note Kuwait is a state owned airline from a Muslim country and therefore don't serve alcohol. The stewardess was very nice always smiled and was happy to help you out with anything. The food on Kuwait was surprisingly good I had a steak which was really good (medium rare) and my two friends had seabass and the other a curry. The only negative I would put is the in-flight entertainment. It basically didn't work and if it did the system was very outdated. To give you a picture think of a gameboy screen which folds out from your chair arm with poor choice of film and basic screen resolution. I've seen other people complain the aircraft is outdated which it is however I found it to be almost a positive giving a vintage feel. I couldn't give you the price of a business class ticket however I assume it wouldn't be quite as expensive as most airlines however still over £1000. Would I pay for a business class ticket with Kuwait? despite its qualities probably not mostly because of the weak qualities in differentiating itself with economy in contrast to the values of ticket prices. My flight home with Kuwait was with economy. I have to admit I was dreading this flight however I was pleasantly shocked. Kuwait's economy seating arrangement is 3-3-3 in comparison to most major airlines 3-4-3. This gives economy seating on Kuwait that little more legroom than most other airlines. In fact this economy flight was probably one of the best economy flights I've been on in terms of value for money. The food was good and although the cabin crew were a little on the blunt side they did their jobs efficiently. Again the in-flight entertainment was awful however I had my Ipad so entertainment wasn't an issue.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Flew from London to New York. Check-in was quick and were able to get me an exit row aisle seat so I was happy. The flight was delayed leaving about an hour late without much interaction with the customers. Walking into the plane it looked like it was stuck in the 70's/80's. Thought it was retro but then the inflight entertainment was a disaster. They didn't offer earphones or blankets you had to ask for them which I thought was a bit weird. Food service was quick food not the best though! The best of it all though was the friendliness and the interaction with children on the plane. The air steward in front of me was playing games with the child across the aisle from me during landing whilst seated. Little things like that made it a bit more fun. Other than that you get what you paid for. Cheap flight cheap plane.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Business Class from Frankfurt to Kuwait Kuwait to Kochi. First Class (free upgrade). Being 6 ft 4 the only reason for me to book business class is legroom. That is what I got at a very reasonable fare. Flights were on time. Food was good. Crew was polite no more no less. I do not use inflight entertainment but use the time to work nor do I drink alcohol during flights. If you want more than that you better choose Lufthansa Qatar or Air India. You get what you pay for. I will use them again.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
MNL-FCO via BKK and KWI. Business Class. Second time aboard KU. Couldn't resist the fare more than half of their nearest competitors. That being said. One has to lower expectations with KU. It is not a business class product but rather a good premium economy alternative with some business class features. Service is very inconsistent. MNL-BKK and vice versa leg food was poor but service was excellent. Bangkok based crews tend to be better and more service oriented. BKK-KWI and vice versa food was okay but service was terrible. KWI-FCO legs food was okay and service was a mixed bag. Some flight attendants being very helpful while some being downright rude. The hard product itself is also inconsistent. KWI-FCO (or for that matter any westward flights from KWI on KU) Seats are small. 34-36" of legroom and about a 20" width seat. These seats are allocated for business but on eastward flights from KWI on KU they are marketed as Economy+. For eastward flights J class passengers sit in the "First Class" section. the seat is a large recliner type seat with plenty of legroom. No AVOD as KU's planes are quite old and most Seatback TVs are either broken or have no content. Priority boarding was observed on some legs but not all. Only take KU if you want a bigger seat better food and more luggage space than economy. Be warned it is not a competitive business product. But if the price is right I say take it.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
London Heathrow to Kuwait KU 104 08/12/2014. Despite booking a window seat eight months in advance and being given my seat number I did not get it instead I was seated next to the kitchen door. The onboard entertainment system was not working. One of the toilet wash basins had no water. One of my friends who travelled on the airline had to do the entire journey in a broken seat. The only good thing is the luggage allowance. I have travelled from England to India every year for the last 21 years and this was my worst experience ever. To be fair the travel agent had advised me not to use this airline but I ignored them.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
I traveled from Mumbai to JFK in Nov-2014. It was a horrible experience. Food was average. Inflight system was screwed up and the staff lacked warmth! My footrest was broken and seats were uncomfortable! Never again will I fly this airline!

### Kuwait Airways customer review
KU102 LHR to JFK on 2nd October and return on 8th October. This was an excellent flight! The food was brilliant. The leg room on the seats was spacious (like Premium Economy in Virgin). The staff were attentive and the pilot announcements were not overindulgent. Overall I recommend Kuwait air on trips to New York. I will now always choose them over Virgin.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Business class from London to New York I cannot believe how bad it was and can understand why there were only 5 passengers in Business and 1st. The flight was delayed by one hour with no apology and Gulf Air Lounge staff said this was common occurrence. The plane was so old and smelled of smoke that I was shocked. The entertainment system did not work and the in-flight crew said this was pretty normal. They could not find me an alternative seat on an empty plane where something worked. It was almost impossible to get the control unit out of the seat and there would have been no point anyway as systems were not working. I could not even get the light to work and if the TV did work the screen is no larger than my phone. For a Business Class seat I was staggered that even the leg rest was more of a foot rest as it did not straighten out or extend. The food was abysmal. Unfortunately I have to fly back to London on Sat 20th Sept and I am dreading the flight.

Manila to London via BKK and KWI. Couple of positive points first. 1) The business class airfare was about 900 dollars cheaper than there nearest competitor. 2) The flight leaves in the middle of the night and arrives in the middle of the afternoon so jet lag is minimized. Check-in in Manila and London was a complete mess with long lines and rude ground staff. IFE consisted of magazines and overhead projectors. The seats are inconsistent from MNL-KWI business class pax are seated in the C cabin but KWI-LHR business class pax are seated in an old outdated recliner seat with minimal recline or legroom. Flight attendants were rude or uninterested in there jobs. No priority boarding. Lounge in KWI is a joke. Food options varied but mostly inedible. Lower your expectations when flying this airline. it is not a business class product they offer but a business class minus akin to a premium economy with larger seats.

I flew business class on the A300-600 from Jeddah to Kuwait the seats were alright but the inflight entertainment was really bad. The attitude of the crew were excellent the food was delicious the take off was alright and landing was superb.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
My husband and my son were travelling with me from Colombo to London via Kuwait on 25th June. After boarding the aircraft we were told the toilets were blocked and the flight will not take off until it was sorted. Waited 3 hours inside the plane until that was sorted. We travelled in economy class our TV screens were broken and my husbands seat was a rocking chair he had to hold on to the seat in front when taking off. These were very old aircraft's - have not been upgraded since late 80's.T he attitude of the staff was poor shocking customer service. Kuwait-London flight was delayed as well no apologies whatsoever.

I flew JFK to LHR return in July 2014. With transatlantic fares being extremely expensive these days I was left with Kuwait Airways being my only viable option without spending $1000+ per person. I considered flying this airline to be somewhat like flying Ryanair - expect nothing except basic transportation from point A to B and everything else is a bonus. The Boeing 777 used on this route is old and clearly in need of an upgrade. PTV entertainment screens worked for virtually no one. However in my opinion the dated interior can be somewhat of an advantage. I found the legroom and seat width to be quite generous compared to other airlines especially the newer 777s with a 3-4-3 layout in economy (Kuwait uses 3-3-3 in economy). The flight attendants were definitely not highly trained or overly polite but I also didn't find them to be rude and they served the meals efficiently. The food was surprisingly some of the best food I have had in economy class. Indian fare was served on all flights and was quite tasty. The JFK-LHR leg included a full hot breakfast I don't believe many other airlines still serve this much food in economy for a transatlantic flight. My outbound flight was just about on-time while my return flight to JFK was delayed by about 1 hour. If you take a look at Flightaware or other flight tracking software for the flight you will see that this flight is on average about 1 hour late so plan accordingly. However given the price paid and the fact that this is a direct flight to LHR I would fly Kuwait again if savings is substantial over other airlines.

KU166 (Paris to Kuwait) and KU361 (Kuwait to Colombo) 18th July 2014. The worst airline and airport. I flew from Paris to Colombo and it was 15 hours (including delays) of sheer misery. No inflight entertainment as the screens on most seats didn't work and the cabin crew were just awful.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
We boarded flight KU102 at JFK bound for LHR on 19th June 2014. I had never used this airline before and didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised. The 6 hour 10 minute flight was without any irritation! The staff were helpful and unobtrusive and even managed to steer the food trolley down the aisle without bumping passengers and/or their seats. Lights were lowered as it was a night flight and the children on board behaved extremely well ie no crying screaming and needing constant attention from their parents. The adults all spoke softly. All very civilised. I am sure the absence of alcohol on board contributed to the lovely peace and quiet. In addition the ride was silky smooth and therefore supremely comfortable. We will certainly consider flying Kuwait Airways again!

### Kuwait Airways customer review
I traveled to Columbo Sri Lanka in January 2014 with a stop over at Kuwait City on the outward and return journeys. The airport itself was like most no good or bad points. The flights on the other hand were shocking. The outward journey was bearable but only because the plane was only half full. The journey back to the UK was disgusting the staff (all male in economy) were rude and argumentative they ignored us. At meal times I had to ask for our dinner as they passed us by. The toilets were filthy toilet paper all over the floor the floor itself was soaking and not cleaned throughout the journey. The inflight entertainment was poor half the TV's on the seats didn't work if they did the sound was poor. There were no alcoholic drinks allowed on the flight so it was soft drinks tea or coffee. I could go on but I think I have made my point.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
My 6 months pregnant wife and I flew Kuwait Airways for the first time a few months ago. Having flown into Chennai from Singapore on Air India and fairly surprised at its improved service standards we were hoping for a good holiday in Europe after our Chennai affairs were concluded. We were impressed by Chennai's new airport and the check in was fairly smooth. They checked in my wife early because she was pregnant and took her medical documentation for making a copy. I mention this because it becomes relevant later. The boarding was relatively smooth though we had to board through the older terminal located quite a way from the new one. The aircraft was a very old Airbus A300. I was actually shocked to see an A300 considering I had last flown them about 10 years ago with Air India and they were considered old then. Surprisingly each seat had a little display screen but what that screen showed I shall never know because on every sector it didn't work. Food was average no alcoholic drinks served. The TV in the middle of the aisle was showing some film but it was so old the colour had all gone and you had to witness everything as shades of olive-green and black. Thankfully the flight was only five hours long and we landed in Kuwait on time. Kuwait airport is without doubt the worst airport in the world I have had the misfortune to step in. Sure it was large looked modern and somewhat clean but that was it. Our connecting flight was delayed. No screen informing us nor was there any person to tell us this. We waited at the gate for hours then someone said it was at another gate on the other side of the terminal so we all ran there then found out it was back at the original gate. The onward flight was on another ancient A310. Again no working IFE food barely palatable. The return was more of the same. Never again with this airline or airport.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Flew from Chennai to Cairo via Kuwait. Flight from Chennai to Kuwait was indefinitely delayed. After 3 hours in the airport they finally gave an approximate departure time. Flight took off after a 7 hour delay. Obviously the connecting flight to Cairo was missed. Flight left 30 mins before we landed in Kuwait and did not wait for us even though we were a group of 15 people who were supposed to take the connecting flight to Cairo. We were made to wait in an airport hotel in Kuwait as their next flight to Cairo was full too. We were finally put on a Kuwait Airways flight the next morning which was again delayed 2 hours. By the time we reached Cairo we were 24 hours late. The flights are very old the in-flight entertainment was a joke the stewards were quite rude. Our return flight from Amman was also delayed and the worst part was we were made to sit inside the airplane for 2 hours without any information about when we were expected to take off. Only positive point was their food which was good throughout.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Travelled with the family from Kuala Lumpur to New York on Business. Upon arrival at the airport my first question was "Is the flight delayed". The flight was on time and from that point forward my experience was pleasant had nothing to complain about. Staff were friendly and helpful beyond my expectations. Inflight entertainment is very poor so plan ahead. Overall from a value for money aspect I think Kuwait Airways is A-OK. I would travel with them again.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Heathrow to JFK return. I am pleased to say that everything was fine. Maybe the cabin crew could have been a little friendlier but they were efficient. The food both ways was good and usual standard for economy class. The inflight entertainment screen was ok on the way out but didn't work on the return trip; used my ipad so not a problem. We would use this airline again as the money saved on the seat meant more available for NYC shopping and trips etc.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
It wasn't just the shabbiness of the cabin poor leg room lack of inflight entertainment delays but more especially the sense that Kuwait Airways doesn't care at all for the comfort welfare or opinions of its passengers. It exists simply to transport people from one place to another at a cheap fare. Not a great feeling when you're on a transatlantic flight for 7 hours. My husband and I booked a round trip flight to from New York to London and back before reading any customer reviews. I read them after we had already made the booking and then dreaded the trip. To my surprise the flight from New York was fine. The plane wasn't crowded and a kind steward moved us into an empty bulkhead seat so we would have more leg room. There were no undue delays. We didn't mind the lack of inflight entertainment or alcohol on board and I was prepared to give Kuwait Air higher marks. Then we flew home. After going through security at Heathrow in London we found when we got to the gate for our flight that we had to line up and go through another security check by Kuwait Air staff. The line was delayed when they thought a French woman didn't have a visa for the US and went away for several minutes to check on this. My husband was next in line and they didn't bother to check his backpack in which he had accidentally left a tube of antiseptic cream. 300 people many with children had to go through this line. Once past this there were no toilet facilities or drinking water available in the waiting area. On board over an hour later we were handed earphones then snacks then ordered to shut our shades. Then 2 hours later ordered to open our shades wash our faces hand back the wash cloths without delay eat dinner. No one had the nerve to disregard all these commands issued by a tiger lady who never smiled or spoke politely to any one except some young Arab passengers blocking the aisle while she did so. Almost no one left their seats until nearly the end of the flight. No assistance was offered to mothers with crying children. As we left the plane I asked a steward at the door what the earphones were for. He said with a broad smile that they were for the inflight entertainment! I just laughed at that. That was my inflight entertainment. I put it all down to a cultural experience until then foreign to me. But I don't really need a cultural educational experience when I'm in a plane. So never again.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Heathrow to JFK and back over Easter. Check-in was quick and easy at both airports. I had loaded some films onto my Ipad so the IFE not working (depended on the seat) I wasn't bothered at all. The seats were comfortable and the staff couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful. They were particularly kind to my daughter who was worried with the turbulence. The food served was excellent on both legs of the journey. So what if the aircraft are old (I note though that they've bought a large number of new aircraft)- it works! I'd fly with them again no problem.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Travel was a nightmare with unhelpful staff. Inflight entertainment was a joke - most of them were not maintained and needed repair. Overhead lamp for reading was not working and when we asked for assistance staff told said they would check it and that was about it. My return flight (21/04/14) from Colombo to London was in transit at Kuwait. 1 hour delay after boarding in Kuwait another delay in hot temperatures inside aircraft for 2 hours (without AC) before being taken to airport by bus and confined to a small boarding room for another 2 hours. No help until some angry passengers started to shout - fruit juice served. After more than 5 hours delay finally we were able to leave Kuwait for London. No apologies no manners! No customer service.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Seat broken staff unhelpful at best rude at worst everything broken including inflight entertainment and personal light to name but a few. Dirty plane and toilets dreadful inedible food an no alcohol served. I thought the flight out must have been bad luck but the return flight was the same on a different plane. Just avoid if the bits you see are that bad what about the safety bits you don't. I have flown a lot this was by far the worst since the 90's.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
FCO-CDG on KU165 onboard an old but very classic A310. Boarding was prompt as only around 30 passengers needed to board. Once onboard the flight was full with inbound passengers who were staying onboard from KWI for the next sector to CDG. Departure was on time and we took off from Runway 25. The inflight entertainment is non existent but for such a short flight do I really care. The food and beverage service was done well and quickly however the standard of catering was very poor. Seat comfort was ok considering the age of the aircraft. For this flight I was satisfied but for a 4-6 hour flight which this aircraft is used for I would perhaps not be so satisfied. The crew were very professional throughout the flight and also came across polite. My conclusion is for the flight I took which was short I was happy and at £82 one way I could not complain. The reality is though KU are still a long way behind the airlines that they compete with in the middle east region (QREYEK) and with this in mind I would always choose one of these airlines on long haul before selecting Kuwait Airways.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Kuwait to Sohag (Egypt) via Sharm El-Sheikh. I chose it because it's the only international airline that flies to Sohag in upper Egypt. The flight was on a really old 20 year old A320. Flight attendants were ok professional but not very friendly food was actually good with a delicious chicken biryani dish. However there was no entertainment of any kind the plane's seats were all blotched and stained. The bathrooms though clean were old and needed refurbishment badly. Our stopover in Sharm El-Sheikh was delayed for 2 hours and we were stuck on a hot plane during this whole period. The sector to Sohag was uneventful but only water was served. Kuwait Airways is centuries behind other Gulf carriers. I don't understand how a rich country like Kuwait has one of the oldest fleets in the Middle East.

London Heathrow-Kuwait-Kuala Lumpur and back. B777-269 and A340-131. Planes were old and really dated. Cabin looked like it wasn't even cleaned. IFE was not working Food was OK and crew barely smiled. I will never fly this airline again!

JKK-Kuwait-Islamabad-Kuwait-Colombo-Kuwait-JFK. I took 6 flights on this 2 weeks trip to Asia. Tickets were cheap. All six flights were delayed. Minimum delay was 2 hours and maximum 18 hours. My first flight from JFK to Kuwait was 2 hours delayed without any reason. It was a 777 but old. No entertainment for 14 hours. Seats were not reclining and food was just food. Staff were rude. My other flight was from Kuwait to Islamabad but it delayed due to fog. We stayed at airport for 18 hours and they told us that all hotels were fully booked.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Flew from UK to Sri Lanka with change in Kuwait. I chose the airline based on price but as the tickets were only £80 less each than Emirates this was a real false economy and one I regret. Where to start old dirty plane unexplained delays in Kuwait legroom bordering on illegal in-flight entertainment totally absent uninterested staff (except one attendant on return flight who was exception to the rule) food ok although no alcohol. During the night flight the lights were not turned down and people were aloud to wander from their seats to have communal chats so it was impossible to sleep.

I flew from Jakarta Indonesia to JFK (NY). My flight to JFK was delayed 3 hours in Jakarta and the flight back to Jakarta was delayed 2 hours. Entertainment was very poor 4 channels and I couldn't pause repeat or forward. I had to ask for a blanket I had to ask for earphones. Mostly the non vegetarian food was finished (so although I'm not a vegetarian I had no choice but to get meat for my meal). Planes were old. I couldn't charge my phone or any other devices. They didn't give toiletries like socks eye shade ear plugs or toothbrush. They didn't maintain the cleanliness of the toilets. I will never fly with this airline again!

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Kuwait Airways is by far the worst airline I have travelled. Our flight was delayed 45 minutes taking off from Colombo and arrived 20 minutes later than our connecting flight. The connecting flight to New York had taken off without waiting for passengers. The support given by the ground staff was next to nil and there was no alternative provided. Ground staff were very rude. we were asked to stay 24 hours for the next flight that they were 'sorry' they were not able to help anymore. We were sent to a hotel near the airport. No facilities provided to make calls outside to inform our family of the delay and to make alternative arrangements as we had to cancel and make new reservations for flight and hotel. The Kuwait airways rates are low which makes this an attractive option but the hassle this airlines puts you and the lack of support or service is not worth that cost. I would never fly Kuwait Airways.

Mumbai-Kuwait-Tehran-Kuwait-Mumbai. My journey with Kuwait Airways came as a pleasant surprise. I got more than I expected. I bought the ticket for its price. The flights were on time food was excellent (I'm a vegetarian) cabin crew were very polite and attentive to my needs. The best part was the hotel stay that was given to me in Kuwait as the transit was too long. The only couple of downsides were the old aircrafts and non existent IFE. Overall a wonderful experience for the price.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Kuwait to JFK via LHR on an older B-777 that had not been upgraded - with older style seats and entertainment. The airplane had been refurbished service standard business class service. The food was good but would have been a lot better if I could have had wine with my meal and port with my cheese tray. With Kuwait Airways "you get what you pay for" - you don't get any special treatment checking in boarding or baggage delivery. I am not saying I will ask my company to book me with them again if I have a higher quality alternative but if I was having to pay the bill I would consider them.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
A quick 3 hours flight from Bangkok to Manila and back. Can't really fault Kuwait as they've shown a rather decent standard on both flights. Flight to Manila was completely full and back to Bangkok about 40% occupancy. Flights on time An ageing A340 but well kept and maintained. I flew economy and granted seeing the Business class it seems quite outdated (fitting C class from the 80s). The PTVs were minuscule and turned off. Meals hot and edible and cabin crew mix of Thai and Filipino only. Ground services very polite and helpful. Kuwait airways doesn't have a smart phone APP but their online check in worked (only for 1 leg of this trip). Amazed to see a 40KG allowance on my ticket. Very comfortable and uneventful.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
London to New York October 19. Flight number KU 401. This is the worst airline I have ever flown - and I've flown many! Nothing worked - IFE system overhead light seat recline toilets. The response from the staff to complaints about broken items was "go and find yourself another seat and that may have a working IFE system / lights / seat recline etc. The safety regulations are almost non existent passengers can seat themselves wherever they like no-one was woken up to recline seat at take off or landing there was overhead luggage all over the airline including in front of the exits and the fasten seat belt light was on for the entire flight so everyone ignored it. The response from the head of customer service in New York was "Too bad. So what if a few 'little' things aren't working". No apology.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
The worst airline especially if you are travelling with an infant. No allowances as cabin baggage for the baby had to stuff everything within 7 kgs for myself and my baby. Had to throw away most of my baby's food ground staff didn't even show consideration after I told them she needed special milk due to allergies and I had 4 hour transit in Kuwait airport. Inflight entertainment was non existent meals and service was very poor. The service was worse than the cheapest budget airlines!

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Travelled with my wife from London to New York mid Sep 2013. Found 1st class to be a very cost effective alternative to the major airlines on this route. Checked in online and printed out our boarding passes. Check in was smooth and the staff pleasant. Proceeded to the Gulf Air lounge which was pleasant and served a variety of hot and cold dishes and alcohol. Flight was delayed an hour without any announcement or communication from the airline. Staff at the gate were not particularly enthusiastic but boarding was swift and we boarded through the priority lane. Onboard 1st class was clean and looked well maintained though old style. The green fabric seats were clean good size and comfortable but old style and not full sleeper. Seats were sufficiently spaced out. The crew were professional and polite but did not appear friendly or as jovial as major airlines. Offered pre-flight drinks accompanied with smoked almond nuts dates and Arabian coffee. Shortly after take off we were offered drinks and some hors d'oeuvres. Offered portable videos toiletry/vanity pack encased Parker style roller ball pen (souvenir) blankets and neck support cushions. 2hrs into the flight we were served a 4 course meal. The rest of the flight was smooth. Arrived into New York 30 minutes behind schedule. Our luggage came out first as they were priority tagged. Our return journey departed New York on time the check-in was seamless the lounge was good the food great the crew were same and we arrive London on schedule. Overall a good experience.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
My boyfriend and I went on a 2 week trip to London from New York and as a frequent flyer of an assortment of airlines I would rather pay more. The cheap deal wasn't worth it in the end. On the way to London the flight was delayed an hour but there was absolutely no communication until they were ready to board. There was a lot of wheelchair passengers and it seemed to confuse staff even more on how to assist and board them accordingly. They rationed blankets so we had to share one. The entertainment was 3 channels with no choice of start time and my boyfriend's didn't work. The food was ok. Flight back to NY was one of the airlines selected for extra security clearance (due to its many previous stopovers) so we had to be searched many times. Once again the flight wasn't on time so they had to rush everybody on to get seated so they wouldn't miss their slot. Once again rude cold monotone staff. I didn't bother to beg for a blanket I bought my large scarf instead. Several headphones didn't work and the flight attendant seemed annoyed about having to give me a new pair. Never again unless its the last resort.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Kuwait - Kuala Lumpor in Business class. It was almost an 8 hour non-stop flight. Service and seat was good enough for me to fly them again for future flights. In-flight entertainment did not work except for the in-flight map but that was good enough for me since I don't really use the in-flight entertainment. The seat did recline for me so that's another bonus. Most importantly the flight departed on time. I might fly with them again if I wanted a non-stop long-haul flight. Business class seats are uncomfortable for sleeping but for the price and direct flight I would consider flying Kuwait Airways again for my future flights.

I booked flights from LHR-JFK back in 2012 and had been worrying every since about my choice due to reviews on here. Flew 25/5/13. Flight out was delayed by about an hour no problem. Plane was pretty old but clean. Staff were friendly and the food was good. Phew. Flight back was also fine. Although customers just deciding to sit where they liked rather than in allocated seats gave the cabin crew some stress. At £200 cheaper than the next option I would use them again.

Took a trip from Malaysia to NYC back to Malaysia. Our flight from NYC to Kuwait was delayed more than 10 hours. Just few hours before travelling to Airport in NYC we did online check in. No information on the website telling us that the flight was experiencing delays. We drove 60 miles to only find out that the Flight was delayed. Had to go back home and when we came at 3am the staff told us that the flight was departing at 5am. Flight did not leave until 7.30. NO communication whatsoever.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Travelled on 4 flights (Aircraft KU 166 351 352 165) and only on the last one video entertainment and spot light were working. During the 20 hours I spent with Kuwait Airways for 80% of these long hours I could not even read a book. If the system does not work on 3 out of 4 flights it can't be a coincidence the person sitting next to me experienced the same issue. Cabin attendants were useless and the rest of the service was average. I travel a lot for both business and leisure there is no continent I haven't been at list twice and I would have expected much more from an airline representing such a rich state.

A340 was probably 18-20 years old but appeared well maintained and was quite comfortable. LHR-JFK left 30 mins. late but made some of it up en route. IFE was useless. Food was really quite good. The cabin crew were appalling and devoid of any warmth or friendliness. They did not interact at all with passengers and seemed at best disinterested and at worst hostile. I would use Kuwait Airways again because they are cheap.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Travelled with my family reserved seats in Nov 2012 for flight in March 2013. KA managed to change my booking so we were separated from my children. Crew including senior steward made no attempt to move us or keep us informed even after speaking to 7 crew members. On outward flight both planes had no working entertainment system. When I spoke to senior steward his response was 'you paid for seat only - entertainment not guaranteed'. There were over 70 seats without entertainment. Toilet did not have a lock - overhead lockers kept coming loose on take off and landing. Some of the Crew had a don't care attitude. The fleet of planes are very old - I will never use Kuwait again.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
We flew MAA-KU-JFK and back. The fares were rock-bottom. The planes were old but the seats leg room service and food were top class. In-flight entertainment was zero as the PTVs were not working on both legs both ways. Our luggage could have been handled better. Other than these my wife and I had no room for complaint. The KU-JFK flight was delayed by about 5-6 hours. The return flights were bang on time. Wouldn't mind flying the airline again and recommend to others. If only they can acquire some new planes.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
London to Cochin Kerala with my wife and son. I booked them because they were at least 25% cheaper than big name rivals. All 4 flights went smoothly with hardly any delays. Planes are older than some airlines but an upside of that is they seem to have more legroom! Entertainment system is also a non event but I knew that when booking. The only other minus for some may be the no alcohol policy but at least you arrive fresh at your destination! KWI airport is small but clean with decent facilities and easy to navigate. All outlets take credit cards even for a small purchases such as single fries or coffee so no currency hassles. The planes were clean the crews helpful and the meals fine and we saved a lot of money by flying with them. I would recommend over other alternatives if you are making a saving on the fare and I would use them again.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
JFK-LHR overnight flight. Check in was easy one of the attendants even offered to carry one of my bags for me. I had already booked my seat online however the flight wasn't full so without being asked they swapped me to a row of 3 so I had it all to myself. There was a good amount of legroom even being 5 ft 11 there was plenty of space between my knees and the seat in front. The crew were extremely attentive and were happy to move people around if they were not content with their seat allocation. Every passenger was asked personally if they were okay or needed anything. The entertainment systems were small but they worked. Food was good (for aeroplane food). The flight was excellent value for money seeing as it was half as expensive as all its competitors for the same flight. I would definitely fly with them again.

ISB-KWI-JED round trip. Aircraft's were a bit old but well kept clean and maintained. Flight attendants were very co-operative and meals were hot tasty and sufficient. The Kuwait International Airport was average but basic facilities were up-to-the-mark. Ground staff was highly professional and very helpful at all airports i.e Islamabad Kuwait and Jeddah. My overall experience on this route was memorable and I will recommend to travel through this airline from Pakistan to Jeddah (KSA).

COK-Detroit with stops in Kuwait and JFK. 3 hours delay in Kuwait refreshments were served. Seats did not recline and the entertainment system was faulty. We missed our connecting flight in JFK and ground staff took almost 3 hours to issue fresh boarding passes and hotel vouchers. I was traveling with a child and a toddler and this delay was unacceptable. We got to the hotel at 11pm though the flight landed at 6.15pm in JFK. Would be good value for money if they improved their ground operations.

Kuala Lumpur - Jakarta on Airbus A340. Departure delayed 30 minutes due to some technical issue. Aircraft looked old judging from the lousy seats and old interior. This is my first time seeing the smallest AVOD screen on aircraft which are square lousy headset - all you can hear is the engine noise not the sound from the movie. The air stewardess was polite and kept asking whether you wanted a refill on your tea or coffee they served a nice full meal for such a short flight.

LHR - Kuwait - Mumbai and back. Having checked in online with a specific seat I was disappointed to find my seat occupied and the flight attendant was unwilling to act. I had to find another seat which was difficult as the plane was full. The seats were lumpy and food adequate. Attendants rather mechanical and unwilling to have conversations. 3 hour delay at Kuwait City. The return flights from Mumbai were similar but because they were not full you could at least spread out and choose a IFE screen that worked. The fact that the flights were not full is indicative of the standard of aircraft and service. The cheapest prices so you don't get the best product.

Mumbai-Kuwait-JFK and back. On our Kuwait to JFK leg we had an unscheduled stop over in Frankfurt. When we checked with the cabin crew we were told that it was a refuelling stop. They did not even announce this before take off. During the flight the snacks were left at the back of the flight however we were not informed of this. When I requested a soft drink I was told that if took it I would not be served during my meal. During both trips the crew were rude seats never reclined food was stale and inadequate inaudible in-flight announcements dirty toilets no blankets. Would never recommend this airline.

LHR-JFK on 10/11/12 (KU101) and returned on 13/11/12 (KU102) in Business Class. Everything went smoothly. On arrival at LHR you can use the Gulf Air lounge which is a very pleasant facility. We boarded without incident. Appeared to be a quiet flight. Staff members were excellent on both journeys. The food was interesting. They handed out some entertainment 'i tablet' type of thing a screen with headphones. It worked well and there was a broad range of material pre-loaded onto it. The seat / cabin are old fashioned but not so as to seriously detract from the overall experience. The seat is not a flat folding seat. This is not BA Club World by any means; however it is a fraction of the price of club world. On the return you can use the Oasis lounge at JFK. There was a scrum for the flight at the boarding gate. This was not the fault of the staff but the passengers. There was a real mix of passengers on the flight; many of whom did not know how to behave. The staff were very good and insisted on orderly boarding. We left and arrived safely which is ultimately all you really want. Staff were courteous and helpful. Otherwise a good experience and it was £546 cheaper than the next cheapest flight.

If you are traveling on an extremely tight budget and don't care how you get to your destination then this may be for you. Traveling with a Group of 12 this carrier managed to get our University of Guam Singers from Manila (MNL) to Kuwait (KWI) (via Bangkok BKK) connecting to Rome (FCO). Aircraft was an A340 followed by an A300 that were extremely dated. The cabin looked old and had a stench that was not appealing. The seats were stained and looked overused. TV monitors were broken and fell out from the harness during the flight. The entertainment was obviously not working in any of our 12 seats. The inflight crew were like robots - going from seat to seat asking in the same monotone voice if passengers will be having dinner. No warmth no personality in the hosts. In the end our return flight was cancelled and although they paid for our hotel stay in Rome we missed our connecting flights. All 12 of us were later put on another carrier which was much better than what we experienced originally flying with Kuwait.

FRA-KWI-CGK. All flights on time nice friendly staff cabin interior quite old (all planes are +/- 20 years old) therefore poor entertainment due to broken in seat screens. Plenty of space from FRA-KWI due to low utilization rate (+/- 30 %).

### Kuwait Airways customer review
LHR-JFK return. Was quite nervous travelling with this airline after reading some reviews on here but was pleasantly surprised with the service. Both flights on time and actually arrived at the gates early. No queues for check-in at Heathrow and a very small 10 minute wait at JFK. Boarding a little messy in Heathrow due to the small number of seats available but this is BAA's problem and not Kuwait's. Hot snacks and a hot meal served on LHR-JFK leg with a hot meal and cooked breakfast with fruit served on JFK-LHR. In flight entertainment is seat back TVs on Boeing 777 can be a bit hit and miss we were a party of four and only half the screens worked. Overall offers excellent value for money compared to competitors on this route and would definitely travel with them again.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
The third time I used Kuwait Airways to travel from New York to Mumbai. I had a very poor experience. I had a flight change in Kuwait. On both flights my seat would not work and I had to sit upright for the entire trip. To make things worse the TV did not work either. I would not recommend this airline if you have other options.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
FRA-KWI-ISB on 4 Aug 2012. FRA-KWI operated with an A300. Seats were comfortable and as I sat in Emergency Row and I had unlimited Legroom. All Flights were on time and Meal served onboard was very nice. PTV screens worked well - volume was a bit too low. Flight to ISB operated by an A320. Leather Seats also were comfortable. So based on that Flight experience I can recommend KU.

July 24th 2012 - Flight KU411 Bangkok to Manila. Having previously flown this airline in economy class which was a poor experience I was apprehensive about flying them again. To my surprise and satisfaction I could not fault them on this fight and will use them again in the future.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
LHR-JFK 28 June 2012 and JFK-LHR 12 July 2012. On the outbound trip there was a 3-hour delay due to 60 passengers from India that were late connecting at Kuwait. On arrival at Heathrow we were advised of the delay given an apology and a food voucher straight away. On the flight the plane was clean and tidy the food was good and we arrived late but that was acceptable given the early notification. On the return leg from JFK to LHR the plane was again late to leave but arrived 30 minutes early. The plane was clean and tidy the food was again good. Polite friendly and courteous service from the cabin crew. The aircraft is almost 15 years old but was clean and what you expect from a modern aircraft. The in-flight entertainment worked on both trips. I found the trip was excellent value for money.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Did the red eye from JFK-LHR. Seats: I had a seat that was clearly broken and it gave me some discomfort. I could have lived with it for the rest of the flight if I had to and it wasn't absolutely horrible. Either way there was plenty of space everywhere and I was just moved to a different seat that didn't have problems. Inflight entertainment some screens don't work but even if they did it's probably not something you'd want to watch. Screen is tiny and quality is poor and can't pause. Staff courtesy: some were serious some were joking around but nobody was particularly rude. Food: they give you a menu at the start of the flight but it's useless as they only really have a limited selection. Either way it's mostly edible if you're hungry but I would just recommend eating a big meal before take off and bringing some snacks along if you think you still might be hungry later on. Overall this flight cost me 40% less than any other flight that was available. At that price the minor inconveniences were hardly a big issue. I got on the plane slept had food and landed and paid 40% less. Great value for money.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
LHR-JFK return. I cannot fault the service we received. Flight was delayed outbound by 3 hours - but this was due to a passenger being ill in Kuwait given refreshment vouchers by the airline. Plenty of leg room - plane was clean and in very good condition. Staff were friendly and helpful and the food good. Return flight landed 45 minutes early. Inflight entertainment did appear to be a bit hit and miss but I either read or sleep when flying and this was only a 7 hour flight. Considering these flights were over £200 cheaper than any other airline I feel that I received good value for money and would definitely use Kuwait Airways again if the price was right.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
I traveled JFK-LHR-KWI (6/19/2012) and KWI-JFK (6/24/2012) and was pleased with the service. I saw a lot of negative reviews online after buying my tickets. I was fearful after reading those reviews. The planes/food/crew were nice. I was amazed at the friendliness of the crew. They were very helpful and provided everything I asked for and followed through. The TV screens did not function on the departing flight as was mentioned in some reviews but I was not bothered by it since I do not watch TV on flights and would rather just sleep.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
CGK-KWI-CAI and AMM-KWI-CGK. Flight from CGK-KWI-CAI was ok. FA's and ground crew ok. A340 is quite comfortable. PTVs didn't work. Flight from AMM-KWI average. AMM airport is very crowded but ground crews were very helpful. KWI-CGK flight was terrible. At first 8 hrs layover then 2hrs delay after waiting we were sent back to airport hotel because of another 7 hrs delay. Ground crew at KWI airport are unfriendly. After finally entering the plane it didn't move for almost 2 hrs before taking off.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Heathrow to JFK - 2 hours late leaving Heathrow later diverted to Boston because of poor weather so 5 hour delay in total. We were given little information about what was happening and there was confusion about whether we would be disembarked at Boston or carry on to JFK. No inflight entertainment at all - no screens working outbound or return. Old scruffy cabin. Not particularly cheap either. Will never fly them again.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
LHR-KUW. The aircraft was clean in fairly new condition with comfortable seats staff were friendly and the screen in front of my seat didn't work but my husbands did. Our connecting flight KUW-COL wasn't as good the seats were leather which were quite firm with even less leg room. Our return trip was cancelled upon our arrival to COL airport which no explanation. Staff booked us onto a Qatar Airways flight. Unfortunately our agent had neglected to book me a gluten and dairy-free meal so I went for very long periods on both journeys with little food.

We travelled to India with no entertainment system whatsoever for a 15 hrs flight! Cabin staff acted like it was not unusual. Seats were not reclining. Cabin staff were not even distributing blankets. Very poor service in total. I will never recommend to anyone.

Flew to New York from Heathrow return. Headphones entertainment and TVs did not work and individual ceiling lights not working. During outbound flight during the day shortly after take off all the cabin lights were turned off so we had an 8 hour flight in darkness with nothing to do. Took same aircraft back a week later and problem the same.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Heathrow to JFK roundtrip in economy. Comfortable enough good food cheap fares but the inflight entertainment system was the worst I've encountered for many years. Very poor selection of movies and TV and on the return leg the screens didn't work in my row. If you want a cheap airline and don't care much about it having the newest fleet and aren't planning to watch movies for the whole trip Kuwait Airways will do the trick.

December 29th 2011 flew from Islamabad to New York JFK. Check-in at Islamabad took a long time because of a big crowd. Flight left on time. An A300-600 plane nice roomy seats clean cabin. Crew were polite and helpful. Food was pretty good. In Kuwait the next flight was an hour late again a good B777-200 plane. This flight was also full. Only bad thing about this airline is the poor entertainment system.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Flew KWI-BEY good food drink and service however could use a more polite crew. Whenever I needed a request they took a huge amount of time to take the request and bring it to me. Not a good entertainment system most of the time it was broken and didn't have the shows promised on the website. Roomy seats however and good catering. I would suggest for the benefit of this airline is to improve the entertainment system. Because check-in was quick and the ground handling was great. Just improve the entertainment system and everything would be perfect.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Islamabad-Kuwait-New York. From Islamabad to Kuwait it was A320. Seats very nice spacious and leather. The food was also very good. Flight left 2 hours late due to a technical problem. From Kuwait to New York it was a Boeing 777. There were plenty of vacant seats. Entertainment system on a lot of seats did not work. Again food and service was good. It was a bargain to fly from Islamabad to JFK and return fare under $950. On the way back from JFK to Islamabad the same thing. All flights left and arrived on time. They serve no alcohol and their entertainment system is not the best. But they provide a great value for your money.

JFK-Heathrow-Kuwait-Islamabad. Airbus 340 from JFK to Kuwait via London. Flight left on time. On a 6.5 hour flight were served dinner and breakfast. There were plenty of free seats. London-Kuwait plane was full. Kuwait-Islamabad flight was very nice roomy seats good food. Their entertainment system is awful. Crew were courteous and polite. Food was like any other airline. For $950 fare round trip Islamabad-JFK I will fly Kuwait Airways again.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Islamabad to JFK. Islamabad to Kuwait was a Boeing 310. Nice clean aircraft. Big leather seats - spacious and comfortable seats. Food was pretty good too. Kuwait to JFK flight was a Boeing 777-200. Good condition and clean plane. Half the plane was empty so it was comfortable. A lot of seats had TV's not working. Food was good too. Service was not bad. Less than $950 for a return flight. For this price I will fly Kuwait again. Their entertainment system needs an upgrade.

The seats in Business Class barely incline 10% and their fleet is extremely old. My journey from Dallas to Mumbai took an ungodly 40 hours with long stops in NYC London Kuwait and then to Bombay. I have flown in Economy with other flights that had better seats than Kuwait Airways did in Business. No alcohol was served on those long awful flights.

Roundtrip NYC-LHR (technical stop) - KWI-MAA. Booked Economy for the cheapest deal from NYC to Chennai. Both onward and return flights delayed by more than an hour. Meals good and luggage arrived safely. IFE is dated and didn't work on both the long legs. Average service. Aircraft look old. Will avoid next time.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
This was the only available flight returning from New York to Heathrow after the hurricane. BA cancelled our flight and couldn't give us another until a week later. The airline was fine although I wouldn't choose to fly with them again staff were fine plane good and it set off on time. Downside was the other passengers who did not understand air safety. One woman got out of her seat when the plane was climbing and children didn't seem to want to wear seatbelts. Other than that and it costing £8000 for 5 of us it was fine.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
They have fallen behind in their customer service. I have travelled with them for 3 years in a row and have seen their service taking a downward spiral. The food has become worse. No bassinet for 6 month old baby even though it was requested while booking the flight 3 months ago. I have to give them credit for keeping time during all the 3 flights I travelled.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
LHR-KWI-BKK*-MNL - (Tech stop BKK). Flew this route a few days ago and agree with earlier comments. Online check-in in London only results in you getting an online check-in receipt and nothing else not even priority check-in desk at LHR. Aircraft are dated IFE almost never works. Food is pretty bland and nasty aircraft dirty and crew can be quite rude and snappy. Safety is low priority with no real checks prior to departure passengers wandering around whilst taxiing mobile phone on throughout the flight lots of passengers listening to music on headphones during takeoff and landing. The only good point is in KWI if you go landside there is plenty to do whilst there is almost nothing airside. Tech stop in BKK has you remaining on the aircraft whilst being chased by people with vacuum cleaners. Have cancelled my return ticket and flying with another airline.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Heathrow to Manila return. Our first flight was 24 hrs delayed (although they were good with their compensation and putting us up in hotel etc.). Flight also delayed once in Kuwait. Planes had seats that either did not recline or reclined whether you wanted them to or not. Constant requests to put seat up for take off by cabin crew were only met with blank faces when I said it was the broken seats and I could not fix it. Entertainment system was poor when it worked with films finishing half way through or jumping from one thing to another. Food was good.

LDN-KWI-DEL return. Outbound travel LND-KWI no TV at all. KWI-DEL was old fleet and smelt strongly of disinfectant. Staff were unhelpful and seating space cramped. Return travel of 9 travelling only 3 TV screen worked Cabin Staff were rude inconsistent and extremely slow. Took 30 mins before someone attended to a request for a cup of water. Children were allowed to jump on seats and run about plane unaided during flight when it came to land some refused to wear seat belts. Safety landing procedures like setting chairs and footrests in position were ignored. Cabin crew were lax on take off with mobile users. When asked for help to put bag in overhead stowage was told by air hostess she had no procedure to a bag in stowage. The only good point was flights were reasonably on time.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Kuwait Airways-New York stopping in London Heathrow. Before take off people were using their mobile phones. We were told that only passengers travelling to London Heathrow would be departing the aircraft after what seemed 30mins we were told that we also had to leave the aircraft and wait at London Heathrow. The inflight system was poor and one of our screens wasn't working so we asked the air hostess to reboot it like on all the other airlines and instead she said it was normal that the TV wasn't working. We also told her that the seats would not recline and she said that too was normal.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
I travelled Kuwait Airways to Dhaka from New York. The seats on the aircraft are way to narrow and leg room poor. The PTV screens don't even function. I was one of the unfortunate ones that got a seat with no sound for my TV. The staff were rude and did not attend to you (even the call bell doesn't work!). Bathrooms dirty and lacking supplies. I personally did not enjoy my travel with this airline however everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If you consider flying with Kuwait Airways for low rate be prepared to hear "you get what you paid for".

### Kuwait Airways customer review
Frankfurt to New Delhi via Kuwait. Frankfurt to Kuwait an almost empty aircraft and staff was friendly - maybe because they didn't have much to do! Plane was really old and many of the seats were broken. The entertainment system was not working on my seat or on the adjacent empty one! The stopover in Kuwait was horrible at best - entire place had only one toilet with 3-4 cubicles and standards were below par! Almost every arabic passenger in the plane was on his/her phone during takeoff and landing - staff did nothing about it even if they saw it happening!. The same experience was repeated on the return journey except this time the staff besides being careless were arrogant and indifferent!

Economy class London to Manila return via Bangkok with Kuwait Airways. The flight was comparable with some more expensive airlines on this route and staff were pleasant and polite. The flight was reasonably punctual and onboard food pretty standard and plentiful. It should be noted that there is very little to do and see at Kuwait airport but during a transit stay of four to five hours we were given free food and did find some reasonable toilets (they are few and far between). Overall this flight was excellent value for money and I would travel with them again.

BEY-KWI left and arrived on time. Plane not new but not bad condition either. Flight attendants friendly and great with kids. I have flown with them 3 times and have not had any issues.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
LHR-KWI-COK. LHR-KWI with lousy inflight entertainment system. The screen was tiny and the movies were repeated. KWI transit was pandemonium connection flight was delayed for hours. There were 3 departure gates with just one door to enter the gate area and passengers for 3 flights were catapulting themselves to get through the gates - ground staff were rude and unprofessional. While boarding the flight one of the ground staff snatched my cabin bag and was about to check-in literally at the door step of the flight with no questions asked. With my laptop in the cabin bag managed to get it from the staff and had to literally smuggle it inside the flight - cabin bag was within the permitted dimensions and I have travelled with the same cabin bag on many airlines. This was the worst experience ever.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
LHR-KWI-CMB return. LHR to KWI boarding was chaotic with ground staff arguing over how the aircraft should be boarded. The delay resulted in the usual boarding process being ignored which meant a boarding free for all scramble ensued with many passengers pushing past families with young children. Once on the flight two of the four IFE screens were faulty - one did not work at all. Headphones for the screens were faulty and the general IFE was poor with long delays between screenings. IFE is a big deal with young children on long haul daytime flights. On our return flights the first from Colombo was again problematic as far as boarding was concerned with delays and queuing. On arrival it was apparent that KWI does not deal well with passengers waiting in transit. It took other passengers to inform us that KA should provide food for long transit waits. The food that was eventually provided was of very poor quality. Our final flight was by far the worst. Having endured a long wait at KWI we were relieved to be boarded with very little delay or problems. On boarding the flight I discovered a bag of vomit in the magazine pocket in front of me. FA was very apologetic but took quite a long time to sort out the problem as I stood by my seat whilst all other passengers had been seated. The offending item was removed and the area around my seat disinfected but it was not a great start to the last flight of a long period of travelling. Again IFE was poor with films repeated and very little alternative choice - faulty screens and headphones. Over the duration of the flight all the hand basins in the Economy toilets became blocked. Towards the end of the flight all Economy toilets were deemed unusable and closed. Passengers were given no alternative toilets which I find totally unacceptable. I will do my best to avoid flying with Kuwait Airways again.

Bangkok to Manila business class fare very attractive cabin staff were helpful. Food not quite business class standard of the major airlines. The flight was on time and our luggage was given priority labels which meant we were through immigration very quickly.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
JFK-DXB in January. The entertainment system didn't work on many seats (mine included) and neither did the audio/music channels. For a long flight from JFK-KWI that's frustrating. What's more the seats for many did not recline. Some that reclined did not return to the original positions. I guess I was lucky that mine did recline and it did come back to the upright position. When I complained to the FA I was told that its nothing new. They know about it and they had informed the engineering dept to fix it. The food was okay. KWI airport is one of the worst to transit - they herd you like cattle to line up at the gate. I was told that due to construction only 2 gates were available for boarding and that was why the chaos. Pearl Lounge (Marhaba lounge) charged me 12 Dinars to use it but it was well worth the 5 hour transit stay. KWI-DXB was okay just one hour and they did serve a hot snack.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
A flight on January 29 took off 12 hours late and the airline had no courtesy to inform passengers. The staff are ill equipped to handle delays and problems and treat paying passengers like cattle. The flight to New York via London was terminated at Heathrow without any information. The hotel at Kuwait was horrible with rude staff and one telephone line for about 200 anxious passengers. Rerouting our flights cost us extra expense for baggage and the fresh ticket and Kuwait airways took no responsibility. Not once did an airline representative talk or meet with the passengers.

I faced the same nightmare as Shelly Talmo in flight on 01/29/2011. My return trip to USA (from Chennai) got stretched by 26 hours due to flight reschedules and cancellations and missed my domestic flight to Austin Texas in USA. Kuwait Airlines not willing to compensate for my loss. Inflight entertainment was very poor. Less choices some monitors do not work audio did not come in one monitor (more challenging to watch a movie on this one). On one segment my monitor control was in my neighbour seat and his one on mine.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
I have never experienced anything like Kuwait Airlines. We were 2 hours late taking off from Chennai. Once we got to Kuwait we stood in a line to enter aircraft traveling to London. Some of the passengers got onto the plane only to be told to get off. We sat in terminal for awhile and then they sent us to a hotel in Kuwait. After 8 hours we were shuttled back boarded the plane another 2 hours later and proceeded to sit on the plane for over 3 hours before taking off. Once in London a tiny voice came over intercom informing us that the flight to JFK was terminated. No reason given. No further instructions given. We stood around Heathrow customs wondering what to do. Finally going through customs we were told that a bus would pick us up and take us to a hotel. I finally got into my room at 3:30 am and told that we would receive information regarding flight at 9:00 a.m. At 1000 we received word from some Kuwait representative that a bus would be around to pick us up at 1040 and that we needed to check out of our rooms. Luggage and over a hundred people were now standing around hotel lobby. At 1230 a bus finally came. We were then transferred to Delta Airlines for our journey home due to leave at 5:00. Delta charged passengers extra money for extra baggage which had already been paid for by passengers at Kuwait airlines. This whole experience was a total nightmare. I wouldn't recommend Kuwait Airlines to my worst enemy. There is so much more but as I've been up a total of 38 hours due to this fiasco I can't think clearly!

BOM-JFK and back during the holiday season. The aircraft was old and shabby tv monitors were old the choice of programs limited. The return trip was a nightmare - flight from JFK was delayed by over 9 hours and no one called to inform us the online schedule gave no indication of a delay. On reaching Kuwait we were rudely told that the flight to Mumbai was canceled and we would have to wait till the next day. We were herded to the hotel and brought back the next night. We boarded the flight sat for 2 hours and then were asked to deplane - technical issues followed by a crew unwilling to extend their hours of duty . We were herded back to the hotel with no apology/ explanation. Finally reached home after 2 days.

Flight from UK to India via Kuwait was meant to take 16 hours changing at Kuwait. Flight cancelled and went next day via Rome. Took 2 full days and luggage not there when arrived in India delivered 3 days later. Return flight also cancelled and after spending day in hotel flew to Kuwait. Onward flight from Kuwait also cancelled so another day in hotel. Was told I was booked on a flight from Kuwait to Frankfurt for the next day and was given documentation. When I turned up for this flight I was told I was not booked on it. Kuwait Airways said I would have to spend another day in Kuwait hotel but made my own arrangements and managed to get back to the UK 3 days after leaving India. Minus luggage again. I will never fly with Kuwait Airways again and would not recommend them to my worst enemy.

It was like taking a trip back in time. Imagine a decent flight in the 1970s. Seats looked old (had ashtrays in seat arms) but comfy enough. Seat-back TV screens didn't work on 1/3 of the seats. 3 video channels (western middle eastern indian) and very old-fashioned VGA graphics on the video system menu. Food was satisfactory. Service from FAs seemed fine - courteous polite etc. But the ticket was cheap.

### Kuwait Airways customer review
I travelled business class to New York - never again even it was offered free. The plane was three hours late boarding a regular occurrence ground staff told me. Boarding was a free for all. The plane was like something out of the 1960's my seat had masking tape holding the ashtray metal in place. The seat was I would say smaller than a premium economy seat. It reclined about 4 inches ie a slight lean. The footrest was a push out at the bottom of your seat plate thing. TV broke down twice. There is no alcohol not really an issue but you don't get given bottles of water - I think I was given two glasses through the flight and had to ask each time. The staff were miserable. The final insult was after arriving some 4 hours behind schedule my lower body was covered in bug bites I assume from the less than clean seat. Not to mention the chap who decided to lock himself in the loo on take off and when the door was pulled open refused to come out so they left him to his own devices luckily enough he was genuinely having a pee. It was the most dismal flying experience I have ever had in all categories from economy to first class on any airline. Its a disgrace. Don't consider doing it unless you are desperate or mad.

Planes could do with a cosmetic refit but I've flown worse. The plane was clean food was fine service efficient and staff were the usual mix of very nice and helpful and very offhand. I would fly with them again as the price was ridiculously low. Considering you get food and beverages and earphones at no extra cost whereas other cheap airlines charge you pretty much to do anything but breathe I can't complain. Just think of it as a budget airline and you'll be happy!

LHR-JFK return Business Class. All staff were charming helpful and polite. The purser allowed my wife's wheelchair to be stored in an on board cupboard. Although my vegetarian meal option was not ordered the purser managed to ruster up an appetizing meal. Would recommend this airline for Business Class travel value for money. The batteries on my in flight entertainment system failed on each leg but were replaced by attendants.

LHR to JFK return B777-200. The staff were rude IFE system did not work for at least half the people on the aircraft (in both directions) and the Cabin looked like it had not been refitted since the aircraft entered service in 1999. Other issues with staff included the guy sitting in the row behind me going off for a quick smoke in the toilet getting caught by the cabin crew and being let off because they could not be bothered to deal with him. This airline is terrible.

Heathrow to JFK New York. The staff were friendly food gorgeous hot towels pillows and blankets and free headphones. On the downside the planes are old and look a little jaded but I saved £800 on the fare between three of us to New York!

JFK-LHR Business. I flew this airline because it was cheap. Experienced the first unpleasantness at check-in when the ground crew sternly reminded me of the limit of hand- luggage weight - it was only supposed to be 6kg! This could have been said in a more polite and friendly manner. My travel agent said the flight was supposed to be B777 but it turned out to be a tired A340 - seat not comfortable. FA service decent enough.

London to Kuala Lumpur via Kuwait in Economy. The baggage allowance at 32kg fairly generous if you need that much. We booked this after reading other reviews on this website and were prepared for a poor experience it lived up to the billing! The first experience on boarding was of a filthy plane chewing gum on the floor and trays dirty from tea/coffee etc - it was obvious the plane had not been cleaned. The planes are old and much of the inflight entertainment either didn't work or was unwatchable (no sound no picture or if you are fortunate neither) - so prepare some entertainment for yourself. I had ordered a dairy-free meal and was on each occasion given either butter/cheese/yogurt and this gave me no confidence in the rest of the meal being dairy-free. The flight crew were not helpful and in one instance when tea/coffee was being served the attendant serving tea said that he would return to me with coffee (and a biscuit). However he forgot and though when reminded he did return minus the biscuit - when I asked for a biscuit he said he'd already given me one! The food was generally budget quality though water/drinks could be more frequently given out. I found the seats uncomfortable. Some would argue that you get what you pay for - we didn't think it was value for money we will not be flying Kuwait Airways again. We feel it is worth paying more to save the 5-6 hour stopover in Kuwait (perhaps 7-8 hours on overall travel time) and getting a better level of service.

Disgusting service throughout the volcanic ash period. We were due to fly back on 17 April from Manila and were told by a Kuwait Airways spokesman flight cancelled. He said natural disaster not our problem and walked away we were not even offered a drink of water never mind a hotel food or drinks. We tried telephoning all next day they would not even pick up the telephone. We traveled the next day to and from Kuwait Airways at great expense and were told we would be contacted when a flight was available. Eventually we were given a flight with Etihad Airways on 4 May - we will never fly with Kuwait Airways again after being treated this way. It has cost us an absolute fortune.

Ridiculously cheap fare LHR-KWI-KOC returning TRV-KWI-LHR. Connection time in Kuwait was reasonable and all flights on time. Flights full in economy but staff were pleasant enough and food was standard economy fare. The aircraft interiors were clean and seemed fairly modern. I noticed a few seats that did not recline properly and was aware that some people had problems with their in-flight entertainment systems. Maybe I was lucky? If you want to take a lot of baggage the baggage allowance is 40kg! I have never travelled with Kuwait Airways before but the trip was remarkable value for money over the Easter period. No alcohol served on board it being a Muslim airline.

BKK-KWI-LHR. Check-in and boarding at Bangkok efficient and courteous. Cabin crew polite and the meal especially enjoyable. The economy section of the cabin was clean and tidy. I don't think the in-flight entertainment was working but I wasn't really too bothered. 7am airside at Kuwait Airport there are a few duty-free shops to wander around and food and beverages courtesy of McDonalds Pizza Hut and Costa Coffee. The on-site bank changes money and there are public telephones operated by phone cards than can be purchased in the adjacent shop. There is no internet cafe at the airport so if you need to check e-mail etc you will need to bring your own machine and use WiFi. Transit passengers get a voucher to use in the canteen on the mezzanine level. But with 5 hours to kill I went to the visa desk instead and bought a Kuwait visa (3 KD). This allows you to go through immigration into the attached shopping mall. However aside from a slightly better choice of food and shopping there is not a massive amount to be gained from venturing in there. KWI-LHR left on time B777 was more comfortable than the A340 from Bangkok. The crew were attentive and quite entertaining food and snacks better than average. The in-flight entertainment was functional this time although clearly in need of upgrading. Kuwait Airways offers a good value service that is efficient and on-time. Non-smokers may not appreciate the ambient fug of cigarette smoke inside Kuwait Airport and the facilities there are a little sparse although the people generally quite friendly and helpful.

Appalling customer service throughout the chaos surrounding the closure of airports due to the volcano ash. Very poor communication on their website and through their offices. Staff do not even pick up their phones in the London or Dhaka office. We visited the office in Dhaka and was met with such arrogance and lack of helpfulness. The Dhaka office apparently cannot even confirm passengers get a flight back on as this instruction comes from Kuwait office. Kuwait office won't speak to staff except branch managers and there is no branch manager in Dhaka because he is absent. Flights to Geneva is being offered with they are not offering to pay for connecting flights from Geneva to London.
