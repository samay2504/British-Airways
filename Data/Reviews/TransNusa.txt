### "would not recommend TransNusa"
I booked a two-leg journey with TransNusa, but due to their scheduling error, the second leg was moved ahead of the first, making it impossible for me to complete my trip. Despite multiple attempts to contact customer service and repeated requests for a refund, I received no timely or helpful response. The lack of accountability and communication has been incredibly frustrating and has caused significant inconvenience and financial loss. I would not recommend TransNusa to anyone seeking reliable service or customer support.

### "the worst experience"
Not Verified |  We were delayed four times. Our flight was scheduled for 20:30, then delayed to 21:45, then 23:30. After we queued at the gate, the flight was delayed again to 01.00 without prior notification! We have to work very early tomorrow morning, and they did not even bother to notify us! This is the worst experience! Never use Transnusa.

### "Customer service is terrible2
They cancelled multiple flights and promise to refund within 90 business days (approximately half a year). They refunded one flight, but the other has never been paid. Customer service is terrible and does not respond or responds that they will check with another department. This airline is a scam and should always be avoided.

### “complete lack of respect for the customer”
I bought a ticket five months in advance, and two months after the purchase, I received an email saying that the flight was canceled. The email didn't mention the reason, nor did it offer any information about a refund or other flight options. It's a complete lack of respect for the customer. We've had to call several times, and no one ever answers. Now, I have to buy a new flight with only 60 days until my trip, and the price is double what I originally paid. Stay away from this airline, it's better to pay more with another company than deal with this issue later. That's my advice.

### “Hopefully this airline will improve”
Not Verified | Saya kurang merekomendasikan karena pesawat ini delay dua kali. Pertama, dari jam 10.00 WIB ke jam 13.15 WIB. Kemudian delay lagi jam 13.30. Sehingga saya hampir kehilangan tiket penerbangan lanjutan saya dari Jakarta ke Bangkok. Kemudian, pihak transNusa juga seolah lepas tangan dengan kejadian itu. Tidak memberikan solusi ketika saya complain. Semoga maskapai ini berbenah. - I don't recommend it because this plane was delayed twice. First, from 10.00 WIB to 13.15 WIB. Then another delay at 13.30. So I almost lost my connecting flight ticket from Jakarta to Bangkok. Then, TransNusa also seemed to let go of the incident. Didn't provide a solution when I complained. Hopefully this airline will improve.

### "will be my last choice"
Previous trip 3 weeks before makes me consider flight departed from Terminal 3. And TransNusa was fit the schedule for business trip at Sept 17 and retuned at Sept 19 But it was disaster Well, at least they informed changes through email and Whatsapp 3 days before. However, when you're travelling for business trip, I have to blacklisted the TransNusa. Depart Sept 17: sched changed 2 times (3days prior into 17.15 and 1 day prior into 19.15) from 15.10 into 19.15 (and finally departed at 20.00). Return sched. at Sept 19 even worst changed 3x 1.50pm to 5.20 pm then changed again into 10.20pm, and changed again i to 11pm when checked in. .. haha 1st time in my life got delayed for 9 hours. And without proper compensation (well, they're clever, informed prior with email:p) So this airline will be my last choice in the future.

### “flights delayed by 3-5 hrs”
Was unfortunate to try their new Subang Jakarta route. Both to and from flights delayed by 3-5 hrs, return flight from Jakarta was 4.10 pm which was first rescheduled to 5pm, then 7.30 then 8, then 8.15 and finally 8.40 pm [writing this review at 8.30 hoping flight will take off].

### "worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever! My flight was rescheduled multiple times with no explanation whats so ever nor was there apologies. Should have flown airasia or scoot.

### "Customer service unresponsive"
I had two separate flights booked with this airline. One from Manado to Sorong and one from Sorong to Manado. There was about a week in between. Both flights got independently cancelled by the airline for no clear reason. Then you have to fill out multiple forms and deliver multiple documents for a refund. Finally, it will take 90 business days (almost a quarter of a year) to process your refund. Customer service also unresponsive. My advice: Do not ever book with this airline! Go for something else, even though it might be a bit more expensive.

### "they stated I had too many bags"
They tried to make me pay for an additional checked bag for an additional 235MYR (APPROX: $50USD) as they stated I had too many bags. I tried to tell them that the website states that each person can have two carry on bags, as long as the weight is ok. They just were NOT listening to me. I tried to show them on my phone and they just rejected even looking at it. So I told the lady there that I would like a full refund if they are refusing my bags so that I can take another flight. She asked the supervisor and she agreed. Unprofessionally, without word, they ripped off all the luggage tags and threw them onto the floor, then pushed the bags towards us. When I was waiting for my refund, they told me to "go to the website". That wasn't the deal" I said, as they told me they would refund me here and now. So I said I'll take the flight then, but they need to accept my bags. I have TEO upgraded tickets and both of these tickets, each one, covers the baggage. They refused to let us fly, pulled out her phone and started recording me (I took a video for proof and my protection as their attitude was very bad). They even called the police over. After explanation, the police agreed with me, but there was nothing they could do.

### "be prepared for multiple reschedule"
If you going to use this airline, be prepared for multiple reschedule. I booked flight at 11:45 and they reschedule it to 17.40 then 18.20. They stated the reason to be operational which likely they don't get enough passenger for the flight so they shove you to God knows when. I only flew this airline twice and they have 100% reschedule rate for me, WORSE than lion air group. My only advise is, if you book this airline, cancel all your plan on the day of travel, you never know when you are going to take off.

### "experience was prompt and precise"
I specifically chose to fly with TransNusa to try out flying on the COMAC ARJ21-700, of which the carrier currently operates two of these aircraft at the moment, and is also the first airline in the world outside of China to operate this small commercial jetliner. Thankfully there wasn’t much of a negative experience, everything from check-in to boarding to the inflight experience was prompt and precise, even if it weren’t spectacular. As TransNusa opts for a single-class layout, the aircraft has a capacity of 90 passengers seated in 18 rows of 5. The smaller capacity of the aircraft meant that boarding and disembarkation was completed fairly quickly and smoothly. Arguably the only sore point of the flight was having to use a bus to board the aircraft instead of using an aerobridge. TransNusa includes 15kg of checked bags as part of the basic air ticket so that’s a nice gesture to have. Despite having to land in heavy rain at KLIA, the entire journey was uneventful and decently pleasant, and it suggests that the COMAC ARJ21-700 will prove a contender in the regional small commercial jetliner market in the years to come.

### "light was delayed by 2 hours"
Not Verified |  When I flew TransNusa for vacation With Family to Bali, my flight was delayed by 2 hours. Even if the weather wasn't good it was still not an excuse to Delay The Flight for over 2 hours. When I Got On-Board The Crew Were Not Greeting Anyone and Were not Really That Helpful. As We Took Off Food Was Served but only half the cabin even though we Still had probably  an hourTo 45 Minutes before approaching Bali. If You Are Travelling With Family/Children I Would recommend either Citilink, or Garuda Indonesia.

### "cabin crews were just borderline okay"
Jakarta CGK to Yogyakarta YIA onboard their A320. This airline is not new - they only rebrand themselves into an LCC. I have heard good things about this airline, but unfortunately, what happened onboard was an aviation safety disaster class. Ground staff at both Jakarta and Yogyakarta were okay, although the baggage staff members at Yogyakarta were slow as molasses. The cabin crews were just borderline okay. What bugged me was that they completely neglected aviation safety; most of the seats had loose tray table lockers, and during take-off and landing, thanks to the force generated during these two phases, those lockers failed, resulting in the tray tables being flung open, including mine, almost hitting my stomach and breaking my camera in the process. Not once did the crew either notice or attempt to fix the issue. Although I would surely give them a second chance in the hopes that they will improve, my first flight with them was traumatizing. I bet I'll stay away from this airline, at least for a while. At the very least their social media team was apologetic, responsive, and thanked me for bringing up this issue, something you don't experience that often.
