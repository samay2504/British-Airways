### "the Avro is an absolute joy"
I was on an Aer Lingus flight operated by Cityjet. My flight was late due to weather in London, and my original flight got cancelled, but I got put onto a flight 55 minutes later. The flight itself was OK. The seats on this little Avro are very cramped. Cityjet uses a 3-3 configuration instead of the standard 3-2. This makes the seats very thin, and leaves you with not much room. The inflight catering was provided by Aer Lingus, and featured a buy on board service. As this was a morning flight, I opted for a Hot chocolate and some shortbread, and for £4.50, this was decently priced. But the highlight of this flight was well and truly the Avro RJ85, which I wanted to fly on before they all get retired, and I am very pleased I did. It is a unique experience, and I would recommend for any aviation fans to try this flight, as it is relatively cheap, and the Avro is an absolute joy.

### "I am still waiting to be reimbursed"
My partner and I took a flight from Dublin to London with Cityjet. The flight was delayed several hours due to weather conditions and they changed the destination from London City to London Southend which is some distance away (Apparently they cannot fly into City after 10pm). While they initially offered to give us a flight the following day should we wish. This turned out to be false as further enquiries at the desk proved they could not actually guarantee us a seat on any other flights and the attendant advised us to take that flight. He assured us there would be a bus put on to take us back to London city. When we finally arrived at Southend airport some 3 hours late there was no bus provided and we were told via text that we could take a taxi and be reimbursed. We arrived home 5 hours later then expected. I am still waiting to be reimbursed for the expensive taxi journey 11 weeks later. Each time I contact the airline I am told I will be reimbursed next week. Their communication and handling of the situation has been less then satisfactory throughout. Flying into London City airport is promoted as being easy and quick but this has not proven to be the case. I would not fly with Cityjet again nor would I advise anyone else to fly with them.

### "No explanations were forthcoming"
Flight was 2 hours late - they couldn't keep their story straight whether it was because of 'wind' (another aircraft going to London took off 20 mins after ours should have) or 'technical issues. Then we boarded and the air con was broken. In Tuscany in August. Whole plane dripping (literally) in sweat. I could see air steward's back through his shirt. Babies screaming, one guy was turning grey and fainting. So we had to go back to the airport. Then we spend another hour at the airport. No explanations were forthcoming this whole time. Operating on hearsay and what we could see. Finally we take off. Passengers actually clap. Then we get to London City 3.5 hours late. Off to luggage pick up. No luggage. No information. After another hour we are told luggage never got onto the plane. It's still in Florence. More waiting as staff very slowly take names and addresses. It's definitely going to come tomorrow. We will courier it. It didn't come tomorrow. It's now the day after tomorrow. No phone call, no one replying on Twitter. Literally the worst airline in Britain. And that's a tough field! And did I mention this flight cost me £250. Not budget travel by any means. Please avoid.

### "still not received my bag"
London City to Florence. I am utterly appalled by this airline. Not only were we diverted mid-flight from Florence to Pisa because of a technical fault (we were delayed in take off also by a technical fault - unclear if it was the same one, but the aircraft was rather old and shabby, and the toilet stunk to high heaven). Most egregiously, about 20 passengers did not have their bags loaded on to the aircraft. I received no information or apology from the airline about this. Some passengers seemed to have received a text letting them know of the issue, with a brief apology and no explanation. We were provided with a bus to Florence Airport where we were told to file a baggage claim (since CityJet do not operate out of Pisa), but there was no-one in charge of directing us - it was up to passenger initiative to figure out all steps. Once at Florence Airport we were offloaded and sent on a Kafkaesque quest from office to office, into the bowels of the airport, across the tarmac, and into the arrivals hall to finally file the baggage claim. Had I not actively engaged fellow passengers I would have never figured out any of these procedures. This was on Sunday, 15th July, 2018. At the time of writing it is 10:30 pm on Tuesday July 17 and I have *still not received my bag*. I received a text yesterday evening from Florence Airport letting me know that the bag had been picked up by the courier, and nothing since. I have been forced to attend a professional event wearing the same outfit each day, which I am washing nightly in the hotel bidet. In all my years of frequent travel I have *never* encountered this level of disrespectful neglect. I paid over the odds to fly with CityJet, hoping to avoid the indignities of a budget airline, only to find that this airline treats one worse than dirt. Never again.

### "They are disgraceful"
Dublin to London City. Our Sunday evening flight was cancelled we were not informed until we got to the check in, there were no more flights available that night. the help desk was closed, we were sent after 3 hours to a hotel and put on aer lingus flight Monday to Heathrow. Not in business class in economy and not together. We had to take unpaid leave at work and pay to get back to city airport. We have to date not received an apology or any compensation! I would never fly or recommend them I would advice to travel with BA or any other alternative airline. They are disgraceful.

### "a big disappointment"
This City jet flight was operated for Air France. After arriving with an Air France flight in Paris from Singapore this Paris to Dublin flight was a big letdown compared to the service with an actual Air France flight. First of all after everyone has boarded their system recorded an error in their reservation . Simply bizarre that they only discovered this after letting everyone on board. This resulted in the plane not even moving from where it was parked for about 50 minutes after scheduled departure. We were then moving practically all over the airport for what seemed like they wanted us to view the runways before the plane actually took off. Service on board was quite slow. After being served the meal it seemed like they did not feel the need to clear the tray tables quickly. One stewardess managed to splash some Coca-Cola on the lady sitting beside me. She was very apologetic and nice but I got the impression that she was under pressure. On arrival in Dublin my bagage which had a priority tag after arriving in Paris on a first class flight was the 85th bagage to come out ! While Air France has consistently maintained high standards it appears that their City Jet partner just could not be bothered to do the same. As a result I missed the noon direct bus to Limerick and ended up having to use another bus company that took 3 hours and 45 minutes and a very convoluted route to get to Limerick. After spending so much to get priority service this connecting flight was a big disappointment and is way way below the service of an Air France operated flight.

### "would fly this airline again"
Genoa to Paris. This was an Air France flight operated by local carrier CityJet. Everything was done through the Air France website and I was able to upgrade to business class for around €200. The business class seat was probably one of the smallest seat I ever flown, however the service was fantastic and for a flight that lasted under two hours there is really nothing to complain about. The airplane had four engines thing that I found quite interesting since it was very small aircraft. I was served a full breakfast that was very nice and the presentation was five star. I would fly this airline again without hesitation.

### "flight has been changed"
Dublin to London City. I booked expensive flight due to family emergency. My return flight has been changed from London City to Southend. Reason given is staff shortages. This is most inconvenient and not what they advertise. No response from cityjet or offer of compensation. Never again.They continually brag about flying you into heart of London. Southend is certainly not that!

### "this flight was a real bargain"
Brussels to Milan Malpensa. With only 29 euros, including drink and snack, this flight was a real bargain. CityJet flies this route on behalf of Brussels Airlines with a rare plane in the west: the Russian built Sukhoi Superjet 100. This turned out to be a rather silent, 2-3 seating plane, with a good legroom. The nice crew, the punctual departure and a truly beautiful view of the Swiss alps made this flight a very nice one.

### "very pleasant short flight"
London City to Dublin. The website is easy to use. Check-in and boarding were well organised. Staff neatly dressed and and welcoming. A drink is included in the cost of the ticket as well as a small snack. Departed on time and arrived on time too. A very pleasant short flight.

### "the crew were exceptional"
We were booked on Cityjet flights from Birmingham to Innsbruck as part of an Inghams charter. I have to say we were apprehensive, never having heard of the airline before, but that soon disappeared once we were actually on the flight. The aircraft was spacious, in that the seating wasn’t cramped as on many flights we have taken and more importantly, the crew were exceptional! The addition of drinks and snacks was an added bonus – please note this BA. In fact we even left Innsbruck 30 minutes early! As far a low cost carriers go, I feel this has a massive future ahead of it. We could not have had a more pleasant flight – both ways. The crew were polite, attentive and very pleasant, in sharp contrast to Ryanair. We have vowed never to fly with them again, even before this latest debacle over cancelled flights.

### "I have no complaints"
Dublin to London City. The lady who checked me in at Dublin was lovely. I saw her help an elderly gentleman and she did so with kindness and professionalism. Boarding was efficient and the interior of the aircraft was clean and the crew were polite and worked hard. Arrival was on time and baggage delivered promptly. I have no complaints and will gladly use again!

### "Every flight has been delayed"
Amsterdam to London City. Flown with CityJet 3 times in the last month, either as KL or AF branded via wet lease. Every flight has been delayed by at least 30 minutes, all with different weak sounding excuses. My last flight  was a joke, first they could not open the door, which delayed the plane by 30 minutes, then it was circling for 30 minutes because of ground complications and when we landed we could not get off the plane because another plane was parked beside it. Their old Avro RJ85 show their age as well and are very noisy compared to newer planes. I recommend flying with KLM or AF instead. Even if it is to Heathrow instead of city. The time won by quicker city access is lost by constant delays. On board a similar meal to AF or KL meal is served, crew is generally kind but seem to be helpless when it comes to delays.

### "staff were polite and smiling"
Flew CityJet from Dublin to Paris. Boarding was very confusing since both doors of the plane were used, but I could not see any information about which rows should use which door. Apparently no one else saw it either since lots of people tried to pass each other inside. Once seated everything went smoothly, and we arrived on time. A sandwich was served, but no alternative for us who do not eat gluten. Coffee was not too bad. Legroom was almost better than on the connecting Air France Airbus. Staff were polite and smiling. Since this was not a long flight I found it perfectly ok, even though the confusion at boarding should be easy to avoid.

### " expect decent and honest communications"
London City to Amsterdam. My KLM flight from LCY to Ams was cancelled due to a heavy storm at Amsterdam and I was rebooked to a partner flight operated by Cityjet. Obviously this flight was impacted by the storm as well and we faced heavy delays (5,5 hours), nothing Cityjet could help given Schiphol was facing serious ATC restrictions. What Cityjet could help was the extremely poor communications. On the airport they kept moving the expected departure time by 30 minutes every 30 minutes. Although Schiphol already reporting a 2 hr delay. When I approached Cityjet through twitter, they did confirm the later departure time, but still nothing at the airport. At 6:15pm they finally announced a gate, with a departure time at 6pm. Everybody rushed to the gate, but nothing happened. When I asked the gate they said they expected boarding around 6:45. Again I asked why it didnt show on the information displays. Ground staff said they could not change that. At 6:45 we boarded and the pilot announced that we did not have a slot time confirmed, but that the company was working on an as early as possible time. At that point Schiphol was already showing an expected arrival of 11:40PM. Eventually we left around 9:45 and indeed landed 11:40pm. Again, in circumstances like this you cannot blame Cityjet for the delays. You can expect decent and honest communications. Cabin staff was great providing frequent drinks during the wait. Seat comfort is extremely poor given the 3x3 layout. Having to wait 3 hrs in a full plane didnt help either of course. At arrival we have to wait another 15 minutes at the gate, before ground staff was able to connect the Jetbridge. At 0:10 we finally could leave the plane.

### "experienced the same problem"
London City to Bordeaux via Paris. This is the second time I was flying with them, and the second time I experienced the same problem. When I registered, I was told my plane would be 45 mins late. Then, we had successive messages "next info in 30mins", and it ended up with a cancellation of our flight 2 hours after we were supposed to take off. In-between, it was just imposible to get any info from anybody. And we later learnt that our plane had a technical problem and they tried to fix it up. And all this happened in the airport of London City, that was fully packed because all flights were delayed! Awful wi-fi connection and no seat available. Sadly for me, I was the last one to queue in the line for changing my flight and accomodation. There were 2 staff to reallocate 100 passengers : as a result, it took 2 hours before I was offered a flight on the next day! I had to find the flight by myself because they only wanted to offer a flight from the same airport with a via, when there was a direct flight from Gatwick.

### "very unpleasant experience"
Florence to London City. Very unpleasant experience my first and only time flying with Cityjet. The flight was delayed due to weather which ok it happens! Then it was diverted but arrangements were made and eventually we made it to City airport. The most unpleasant of the flight was the lost luggage and the poor service afterwards. Nothing was told to me appart from the numerous times I contacted the company and they said they didn't know what happened. After one month I have no luggage and no response from the company! That's not the way to treat customers and I felt very upset. This was not a low cost flight and the quality of the service was far below any low cost I ever did.

### "attendants were professional"
I flew CityJet from Amsterdam Schiphol to London City. The flight was fully booked and the ground crew suggested at the gate to have our carry on luggages loaded into the baggage compartments because the overhead bin wouldn't be able to accommodate all luggages of the passengers. Very well solved by the crew. The flight was pretty much an uneventful, meaning no delay and smooth. The flight attendants were professional, distributed the refreshments and snacks within the short flight time and did the clean up afterwards (45 minutes of air time). Leg room is more than decent and very comfortable seats. This aircraft is still equipped with the old style seats, almost like a sofa, very soft and comfortable.

### "FA's all friendly and relaxed"
Dublin to Paris CDG. Business Class on Cityjet RJ85 the middle seat is left empty. In fact there were only a few business passengers on the flight, so each passenger had an entire row of seats. The RJ85 is renowned for being very quiet, and the flight was most comfortable. Within the limitations of operating Business Class simply by putting a curtain up to separate from Economy, the service was fine. FA's (all Irish) were all friendly and relaxed. A light breakfast was served, and coffee was topped up as required. I booked Business Class only because I was connecting to a long haul flight, and there was no option to book "C" for long haul and "Y" for the short connection. Otherwise, it would hardly have been worth the extra money simply to get breakfast and to ensure I had no-one in the seat next to me. But the service was good, the breakfast was basic but fine, and I have no complaints.

### "flight is cancelled"
CityJet flight from London to Paris initially planned to take off at 6.10pm, delayed until 6.55. Passengers called for boarding, waiting in 30 degree heat for 30 minutes in a small room, until an announcement that the flight was further delayed by 1.5 hours. Compensation of £5 for refreshment. Another boarding at 9.00pm. 1h later, flight is cancelled. I don't know where I will sleep tonight, when I will be back to work.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
Booked tickets to Japan using Cityjet from London to Amsterdam. Terrible mistake. First flight to Amsterdam was delayed so much we missed our KLM connecting flight to Tokyo. I'm writing this now at Amsterdam airport waiting for cityjet to arrive, as it is late once again, with no info whatsoever. Probably their old planes broke down again. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "dismal level of customer service"
Our flight from Florence to London City was cancelled, zero information was given for over 2 hours, no one from CityJet was in the airport to answer questions or provide assistance in the meantime. When someone finally arrived they were unable even to say whether we would be flown home the next day. No announcements were made at the airport as to what passengers should do. No apology for the fact that those of us who are UK nationals are now disenfranchised of our referendum vote. Appalling treatment all round. City Jet you should be ashamed of yourselves. Would never recommend this airline in light of such a dismal level of customer service.

### "a total fiasco"
An absolute nightmare of a journey from Cork to London City involving a 4.5 hour delay. A plane was sent from Dublin and arrived 3.5 hours after the problem first arose. I had booked seats with my children but was reallocated a new seat which took no account of the original booking. Clearly, having decided to pull out of this route the company aren't concerned about passenger inconvenience. Staff were far too glib. I will never travel with them again - a total fiasco.

### "flying from London City is a breeze"
Simple, really. Flying from London City is a breeze compared with battling the Piccadilly Line to Heathrow, took me 55 minutes from my office in Camden to the gate at LCY. CityJet flight took off on time (always great to walk to the plane across the tarmac), free snack a drink (booze included), walked straight off at Dublin and straight out of the airport. The delay on the way home was not the airline's fault, and the journey back to North London from LCY was still far easier than Heathrow. Cheap flight, good service, great airport. Shame I can't fly to San Francisco direct from LCY.

### "seemed to be the cheapest"
Cork to London City Airport, I chose Cityjet as they seemed to be the cheapest. The reviews were mixed and I decided to try it anyway. First off, I decided to just take hand luggage, as it was very expensive to choose extra luggage. However, after a week or so I found out that there was luggage included (up to 23kg) - nowhere was I informed of this, which could have led me to pay extra for it. This should be shown when ordering, but it was not. The airplane from Cork to London City was quite small. I think it had about 13-15 rows, and the plane was less than half full on both ways. The aircraft was very noisy, I had to turn up my headset to full volume to be able to listen to the music. The flight attendants were friendly both ways, however very slow to serve drinks and food - it was already a pretty short flight of 1 hours and 20 minutes. There was however drinks included (also alcoholic drinks) and a snack (a pack of biscuits on the way to London, on the way back a müsli bar). I did not expect any food or drinks, so that is fine. I appreciate the very fast support and response from Cityjet on Twitter, though. The seats were fairly small and not comfortable to sit in at all and there was no Wi-Fi.

### "service swift and efficient"
Amsterdam to London City - I am not a fan of smaller aircraft, but, I must admit, the Avro RJ85 might have converted me - thanks to Cityjet's service. The flight was full. The seating was 3-3 configuration. It was not the best pitch but the seats were comfortable. I was amazed with their lovely cabin crew. They managed to serve coffee and biscuits to everyone even though the flight was just over an hour. Their service was so swift and efficient. It was a very good flight.

### "really good experience"
Short and easy CityJet flight from London City to Paris Orly. Check in was very easy with helpful staff at London City Airport. This was my first time at this airport and it was a really good experience. Boarding was quick and easy. Flight attendants were friendly. Catering was simple packet of gourmet crisps (or a cake) and a drink which was really satisfactory given the length of the flight. Inflight announcements made by the pilots were good and informative. Seat comfort was acceptable, and the aircraft type quite pleasant.

### "attitude is appalling
I turned up at the airport, CityJet ticket in hand, but was informed that my Nantes to London City flight was cancelled. As nobody else was there complaining, and I was at the desk for an hour, I can only assume that the flight didn't have enough passengers to make flying financially viable. The plane was due to leave London at 0905 to arrive at my departure airport, but never left. Ordering and paying for the ticket was done online and emails had been received from Cityjet prior to the departure date, however they did not email at any time telling me the flight was cancelled and by the time I found out, at the airport, it was too late to book another flight with Flybe and there were no other flights that day. I was going to London to a concert, tickets for which had cost over £100, there are also no tickets available for subsequent dates. Cityjet's attitude to their customers in this case is appalling, it has ruined a much anticipated event and day out all because of a failure to act in the customers interest. Customer service has taken a back seat due to laziness. Myself and my wife travel this route or Gatwick on a weekly basis using Cityjet or Easyjet, we both agree that Easyjet will be getting 100% of our custom from now on.

### "service was excellent"
London City to Dublin at 1700hrs. London City was easy to reach on the DLR, the airport was a breeze to get through. Left on time and into the air all withing 5 mins of leaving the gate. Service onboard was excellent with a drinks and snack service. Dublin Terminal 1 no queues - luckily no bank of Ryanair flights coming in - straight through to baggage reclaim and had my bag within 15 mins of landing.

### "crew very good"
My wife and I flew CityJet from Amsterdam to London City. Left and arrived on time, aircraft almost full. Crew very good, snack and drink served on short flight. London City is a great airport to use, we were at Victoria station within thirty minutes of leaving the plane.

### "a lot of technical delays"
CItyjet is a no nonsense airline with an ageing fleet. Their Avro RJ85's are really showing their age now with a lot of technical delays recently. My flight (WX197) was delayed for almost two hours (02/DEC) on a multitude of reasons. Initially the scheduled plane had a technical fault.They flew a spare part in from Dublin, but then the mechanics did not make it on time and a CityJet night stopper was re-scheduled. This plane then had to be evacuated on a security issue and was no longer available for taking the flight back to Amsterdam. CityJet took some effort and flew a spare plane from Dublin which first had to be completely catered and cleaned. Once we were ready to go after 1hr 55 on the ground the flight was a normal and eventless flight of 42 minutes. These Avro's are really showing their age, not just in reliability but also the cabin and other interior.

### "avoid it like the plague"
If anyone is considering flying with CityJet, I strongly advise you not to do so. Flight cancelled due to fog at London City. Agreed, this is not the airline's fault and therefore the airline does not have to pay compensation. However under European Regulation No EC 261/2004 the airline is obliged to give passengers written notice of their rights. Even when we asked for a statement of our consumer rights the airline actually refused to provide this information. The airline is also expected to offer rerouting or another flight at the earliest opportunity and is required to look after its passengers (meals, hotels in the event of overnight delay) in the meantime. Cityjet did not admit responsibility for doing any of this, the staff at Orly were brusque to the point of rudeness and refused to do anything for us, stating "it's the weather". Unfortunately at the time we did not know our rights, but no reputable company would behave this way. Avoid it like the plague.

### CityJet customer review
Waited 65 min for bag drop at Florence - after only one check in desk for premium and economy for the first half hour (from 90 min before flight WX 280). Suitcase was damaged en route from LCY to Florence. Service on board is minimal - tea, coffee water and a small snack, but pleasant crew. It was overpriced at £340 return. The return flight was 55 min late leaving which the crew had the cheek to blame on security queues - nonsense! Then the push-back tug broke down. Safety rules breached by allowing window blinds to be closed at takeoff.

### CityJet customer review
WX 300 Cardiff to Edinburgh. 18th May. Return 19th May WX 310. Travelled from Cardrff to Edinburgh and was hugely impressed by the service. The attendants were very helpful and happy and the complimentary drinks and snacks came in handy. Shame they're leaving Cardiff airport.

### CityJet customer review
Travelled from Cardiff to Paris on 20th April 2015. Return flight 23 April 2015 flight no WX286. Complimentary snacks drinks were served by friendly attentive flight attendants making the CityJet flights operated by Stobart Air a very enjoyable experience. Also no queries about carry-on luggage or charges for checked luggage a rarity these days. I would certainly recommend CityJet to those who appreciate hassle-free flying.

### CityJet customer review
My wife and I returned from a week in Amsterdam on 17/3/15. Our flight WX0196 was cancelled due to adverse weather at London City Airport so we were put on a later flight. As we approached for landing the plane took off again and we were landed at Stansted instead. There was an announcement over the PA system that if we made our own way to London we could reclaim the cost of travel back to London. So far so good as they cannot be held responsible for the weather. When I emailed CityJet they said they were not going to reimburse the £38 for the train fare back to Liverpool Street and that the announcement on landing at Stansted should not have been made. I paid nearly £300 for our return tickets so not budget price tickets. I will not use this airline again as their "customer care" is non existent. There are other airlines that fly from LCY so choose carefully. CityJet is operated out of Dublin by KLM and an Air France alliance so their ticketing will be on the same flight.

### CityJet customer review
Delay delay delay. All that can be said really. What I find most infuriating is the lack of clarity re the delays. Flight WX280 Florence-London City on 30/3/15 check in opened half an hour late with one person - who worked for Florence airport not the airline - turned up finally to check people in. Had no idea what he was doing. Another two turned up some 15 mins later who also had little idea of what they were doing. Finally checked in with 1 hour to spare until the flight allegedly departed. Got through security etc to find that the flight was delayed by half an hour then it was delayed again then again until eventually the 13.20 flight left Florence at 15.50hrs. Oh and it would take an extra 40 mins because of head winds. The cause? Delay from incoming flight' - yes because they had been delayed leaving London. If I'd known it would be delayed for 2.5hrs I would have found something much nicer to be doing in Florence! Really not impressed.

### CityJet customer review
WX281 on 23 March and inbound WX280 on 27 March. Never again. Both the outward and inward flights were delayed with minimal explanation either during the delay or afterwards. Bored cabin crew cramped uncomfortable seating inadequate overhead locker space and no food available even to purchase. Also when the Captain addressed us it was impossible to hear what he said.

### CityJet customer review
Just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam flying out of London City Airport. Flight was fine for a short flight and the location of City airport was convenient. Was disappointed by how they handled the large volume of cabin trolley cases on both outward and return flights. On the way out of London nothing was said until my friend and I boarded the plane and there was no space left in the overhead lockers for our trolley cases both of which were standard cabin size. This was the case for a number of passengers and it was inconvenient as we were told that we had to take them to the front of the plane for them to be put in the hold which caused difficulties as passengers were trying to get down the aisle in opposing directions. On the return flight out of Schipol as we queued at the gate to get on the plane they saw that about 10-12 of the passengers at the front of the queue including us and told us that we would have to hand our baggage in to be placed in the hold. What bothered me was that after we took our seats we saw people coming onto the place after us who had trolley cases bigger than ours - so it seemed unfair that some of the passengers were treated differently.

### CityJet customer review
Great flight from Dublin to London. Such friendly cabin crew. Flight was punctual and was perfect for this short flight. Will certainly use them again.

### CityJet customer review
WX71 22/12/2014 and WX88 on 29/12/2014. Complimentary snacks drinks and delicious chocolate bonbons were served by friendly attentive flight attendants making the CityJet flights operated by VLM a very enjoyable experience. Also no queries about carry-on luggage or charges for checked luggage a rarity these days. I would certainly recommend CityJet to those who appreciate hassle-free flying.

### CityJet customer review
WX 185 London City to Amsterdam Shiphol on 7th November 2014. We took CityJet for the first time to fly to Amsterdam as the departure was from City Airport but I would have preferred travelling from Luton airport as it would have saved me so much time and money. Indeed we had to give our cabin luggage because the flight was too busy but few people that were coming late could have kept it even though their bags were probably larger than the acceptable cabin sized luggage as they could not be bothered. They said they would check what they can do as we did not want to leave the luggage but they obviously never came back and I ended up arriving late to my business dinner as I had to wait for my cabin luggage to arrive. The flight itself was a nightmare as the plane was very old so very noisy and uncomfortable. Never again!

### CityJet customer review
Seems like there is a theme with these reviews. Great or flights cancelled with no regard for the customers. I booked a weekend in Dublin for my wife's birthday primarily because we could fly from Cambridge with Cityjet. 3 weeks before we were due to travel I received a text telling me that the return flight had been cancelled and that the alternative offered would fly to London City. I called to enquire how I was expected to get to Cambridge (thinking that they would offer a taxi or some recompense) and was told that they had informed me well enough in advance that it wasn't their problem. Consequently I cancelled both flights and re-booked with Ryanair at Stansted. I was told that the flight was cancelled because it was "seasonal". No-one at Cityjet realised that when they sold me the ticket? The customer service is appalling. It lacks any genuine concern and those involved sound like they are abiding by a script. On numerous occasions I have been thanked for my understanding! Well I don't understand and these CityJet should be ashamed.

### CityJet customer review
Flew back from Dublin on 8th October 2014 to Cambridge. First time I've used Cityjet and was really impressed. Excellent service very friendly and helpful stewardess. Fokker 50 was very pleasant to fly in. Arrived bang on time in Cambridge and was out the airport and in a taxi in 10 minutes brilliant.

### CityJet customer review
Cambridge to Dublin. I was looking for an alternate to Heathrow Gatwick Stansted and the low cost pay for everything else airline. CityJet was it. Conveniently located in Cambridge 20" from home no car park charges I could go on and on. Economy ticket included 1 checked back and 1 carry on. I received a text update as the day of the flight got closer online check in was a breeze. Airport staff were superb and flight crew amazing unlike their competition. Will be using them again. Bonus if/when going to the states is one clears US customs in Dublin saving time frustration and allowing a more pleasant journey.

### CityJet customer review
Booked a return flight from Amsterdam to Cambridge well in advance. Exactly 1 month before my departure I received an email that the flight times had changed. The time changes were not an hour or so but half days instead of arriving at 10am it would now be arriving at 14.00 whilst the return flight was now 4 hours earlier? Making it impossible for me to make my appointments. Customers services (after a very long wait) quite arrogantly told me they couldn't do anything for me no alternative solutions were offered. I am now forced to take another more expensive flight to Stansted with an additional train ticket to get to Cambridge. Very disappointing service from CityJet. It is completely strange that airlines can still get away with this.

The flights I have been on have been very good - even short ones still have a trolley service and the seats are comfortable. Flights to Dublin and Amsterdam were introduced twice daily on weekdays from Cambridge Airport. My partner and I took advantage of this soon after launch and booked a return to Dublin. Everything perfect. This week I had to go to The Netherlands with a colleague and suggested flying from Cambridge. My institute has about 600 employees and many travel frequently and we were the first to try CityJet. Unfortunately CityJet had decided to drop the afternoon flights but didn't manage to inform us (details not known perhaps because we go through an agency). Staff at Cambridge Airport were very professional and rebooked us onto a flight from London City Airport and arranged a taxi. As our return flight was cancelled as well our secretary got in touch with CityJet to rearrange the return flight. Unfortunately this turned out to be a complete nightmare for her it took her a whole day to finally get things arranged and as a result CityJet is now blacklisted at my institute. I feel bad because I wanted CityJet to succeed but unfortunately they don't seem to employ the people that understand that customer satisfaction is important for success. Their website still shows two daily flights from Cambridge so there is much improvement to be made. I can unfortunately no longer recommend CityJet from Cambridge. A real pity.

London City to Florence on Aug 31 2014 and Florence to London City on Sep 6 2014. Will never fly this airline again. It's partly an issue with them and partly the airports I flew in and out of: London City and Florence. On both ends dropping off bags was a mess. No one seemed to know where I should go and people (CityJet staff) told me 2 different things. No one informs you that you can't check in until 2 hours before (until you've waited in different lies because misdirected) and there is no CityJet counter in Florence. Not labelled anywhere. Had to ask 3 people and be told different things before I ended up in right place (aeroporto di firenze counter). Never again.

Nantes to LCY. On time departure and early arrival. Aircraft clean and staff attentive only slight downside is length of time for baggage to arrive at LCY. A total contrast to my outbound on Easyjet from LGW.

### CityJet customer review
Our flight Toulon - London was cancelled on 29th July. We were made to wait for 4.5hrs before we were told that there would be no help from Cityjet and we had to find our own way back to London. This had to be done the next day as there were no flights from Toulon and not enough time to catch a flight from Marseille or Nice. Had we been told right away we could have found alternatives. Apparently there was a technical problem on the aircraft and as such Cityjet is not liable for any costs even the initial costs we were told. The flight was only half full. This is the worse customer service that I have experienced.

### CityJet customer review
Flew St Helier to Cardiff last Monday first time with this airline. First impressions were good from friendly steward greeting on the front steps but not so good on actual plane Fokker 70 showing its age as it was a bit grubby and with heavy wear and tear left it feeling rather old fashioned (note the in-arm ashtrays - I can remember the days of smoking on planes and thank goodness this doesn't happen anymore - and overall browny beigeness of the fittings). Very good service offering hot/cold/alcoholic drinks and a sweet or savoury snack not expected but appreciated and the poor steward barely had time to clear up before landing such is the short flight. The 23Kg baggage allowance must be one of the most generous in the air so good on CJ for this. Overall would fly with them again.

### CityJet customer review
Booked a return flight for my partner and I to Amsterdam for a family wedding and personal holiday. London City Airport is bliss no queues just relaxing we arrived 45 minutes before our flight and had time to sit and have breakfast before our 9.25 flight. Even though the flight was only around 40 minutes in the air the flight crew still managed to give out drinks and snacks. The Avro RJ 85 was comfortable and more than suitable for the flight cabin crew were attentive and authoritative while still remaining pleasant. Cityjet is a full service airline and well worth the money. Since I was travelling in August all airlines charge summer rates (200%) but as Cityjet is not a holiday airline their fares don't change in the summer meaning they actually became competitive with Easyjet and KLM. Luggage and food is included flying from London you get to experience the world's best airport and they really do take all of the stress out of flying. Cityjet only cater for short haul business flights so offer no entertainment but on a 40 minute flight what could they do? I will definitely use them again and am recommending them to everyone!

### CityJet customer review
Flights from Paris Orly to London City often delayed (2.5 hrs today) because staff were not available: this happens usually when the last plane arrived late the day before. Despite being aware of this issue Cityjet don't warn passengers (text message email) or foresee another staff to be on time. So time lost at airport. In addition to the excessive cost (usually 400-450€ return) and poor quality of plane (noisy Fokker F50) this is not acceptable. Unfortunately this is the only carriage to operate London from Orly so no choice!

### CityJet customer review
Cambridge to Dublin. Third time using this new service and what a pleasure compared to the scrum of Stansted and Ryanair. Free parking at Cambridge fifty yard walk to the gate stress-free check-in no arguments about cabin baggage. Very friendly in-flight service complimentary drinks and snacks. Gate at Dublin is much closer to terminal as well saving a fifteen minute walk. I fly to Dublin at least once a month - hope this route is successful I would hate to lose it!

### CityJet customer review
We took CityJet from London to Florence and back in early July. We thought the aircraft itself was lovely - clean and comfortable. The service both at the airport and on-board was excellent and efficient. I consider the quality of this airline equivalent to JetBlue - overall a very pleasant trip.

### CityJet customer review
Flew from Cambridge to Dublin last Thurs 3/7/14. Excellent service friendly staff good price - highly recommend this service. It makes a welcome change from dealing with low cost carriers and huge airports. Planes are a little old but doesn't detract from the positives.

### CityJet customer review
Flew from Cambridge to Dublin. Outbound was great. However when I went to check in for return flight from Dublin I was greeted with "You know this flight has been cancelled don't you? When I pointed out that the flight was still showing on departure board I found out it had only been cancelled within "the last 15 minutes". We were put on flight to London City and then transferred by cab to Cambridge. 3 hours late. Cityjet have so far not responded to my request for a callback. I received an e-mail thanking me for my "detailed comments" (which I haven't sent) and thanking me for my feedback (which again I never provided). Pity really because I would have recommended Cityjet were it not for the appalling customer service.

Flew Newcastle to Paris return with family members. Nothing too much trouble for the cabin crew on both legs. Early arrivals and stress-free flights made for a pleasant trip away.

### CityJet customer review
WX120 from DUB to LCY 27th May and WX121 from LCY to DUB on 28th May. I agree with previous reviewer - call this "progress" and a wonderful message from the CEO on how the split will only mean improved services? The website is a joke for checking in - whoever designed this knows nothing about end-user experience! You used to be able to print a boarding card at LCY by just using your passport - now you need the booking ref hence the number of people standing at the booths scrolling through emails on their smartphone - ugh! No more "Sky Priority" on my boarding card which got me through the fast lane at security and when I asked re FF program "there are no plans yet to introduce one yet". Roll on the alternative!

### CityJet customer review
Early January to celebrate an anniversary my husband and I decided to visit Dresden and booked a pre-flight hotel close by to LCY airport and seven nights in a hotel in Dresden. We booked with CityJet to fly off on 9/6/2014 and return on 16/6/2014. In April 2014 we received an email from CityJet to say there was a reschedule to 24 hours later on both flights. We were not prepared to pay the increase to double the cost of our London hotel booked at this later date and so we had to lose this luxury we had planned. My husband went to LCY airport to check all was well and took along a hard copy of the email of the reschedule information. At the CityJet desk it was confirmed that we were booked on the 9/6/2014 and 16/6/2014 flights. He informed the desk clerk that there were no flights on these dates and he was told that we were not booked on flights on 10/6/2014 or 17/6/2014 and that he should phone the 0871 telephone number on the reschedule email. He suggested that the clerk should do this for him. After 25 minutes on the phone-apparently due to a computer problem-the information was corrected. Obviously this situation was stressful but things seemed to go smoothly from thereon. However on our return when we went to the passport control to prepare to board our flight to LCY we were informed by the passport controllers that our flight was cancelled and advised us to return to the check in desk. Here they knew nothing of the cancellation and had to make enquiries. After a short time were told there were technical problems with the flight leaving London and it had to return to the LCY airport and another plane will fly us to LCY in 2 hours time. Instead of 13.25 we left Dresden at 15.45. The flight staff were good but no more CityJet for us for a while I think.

### CityJet customer review
I am a frequent flyer with Cityjet / Air France - at least once per week for 3 years now. Cityjet is a lot worse now that they have split from Air France. Website is rubbish - always crashes or hangs. You never know if you have booked a flight or not. Several times I have had flights cancelled because payment hasn't been processed - only thing is they don't tell that this has happened. You only find out when you try to check in. There is no longer any automatic check-in for frequent flyers. There is no place where you can see all your bookings at once - particularly unhelpful for frequent flyers. If I had any alternative on the route then I would switch - and I understand that I will later in the year.

### CityJet customer review
Flight and service okay but seats in AVRO R85 are very narrow and although legroom for a small plane is acceptable very uncomfortable.

### CityJet customer review
Cardiff - Glasgow. Unable to check in online. Booked flights through ebookers. Air France flight operated by CityJet seems their online check in cannot cope. What's the point of having an online check in system that cant be used. Having to check in at airport seems to defeat the purpose. Called cityjet customer service 3 times and no one could help me or give an explanation a complete waste of time and money! Unhelpful unreliable and uninterested in helping customers.

LCY-AMS. Avro 85. Flight was ok nothing special. Guess cant expect more of these short jumps its like a bus ride.

### CityJet customer review
With the intention of saving a little money I was again brought back to reality and had to realize that it is probably better to pay a little more for an airline where the costs are not hidden in the dirty details. Travelling with a child under two years I was glad to see that Cityjet charges "only" 3 EUR for the child travelling on your lap. Concerning the fact that we had to check in one bag (which costs an extra 15 EUR when doing it during online check-in - completely ok) I tried to check-in online as offered by the airline. Stupid enough that during this process I get the information that online check-in is not possible when travelling with a child under the age of two. This bumped the costs of our checked-in bag up to 30 EUR because we had to do it at the airport. With two flights this makes 30 extra Euro just because we were travelling with a child on our lap - not occupying a seat. So in fact the child was travelling for 33 EUR. Cityjet states in its policies that every child under the age of two may carry one piece of baggage up to 10 kg a stroller and a car seat. When we arrived at the airport we were told that only the stroller was allowed. Neither the car seat nor the 10 kg bag could be taken on the airplane - unless we paid for it. I will never travel with Cityjet again.

### CityJet customer review
LCY-RTM. In this age of low cost airlines one almost forgets to appreciate a full service airline. You pay more than easyJet or Ryanair but that's the only disadvantage. Everything on this short hop was great which starts with the very convenient London City Airport. Early quick boarding with the aircraft just a few steps from the gate. Not to young but well maintained Fokker 50 with ample legroom. Polite attentive crew provided us with a sandwich nuts chocolates and two rounds of drinks on a 50min flight. Landed 25 mins ahead of schedule in Rotterdam and outside the airport within 5 mins. Will certainly use again if the price is right but you have to take into account that the trip between LCY and the City is much cheaper than the train fare to/from one of the big London airports.

### CityJet customer review
Dresden-LCY. Very good flight. On time enough space good catering for short flight. Staff pleasant. Reasonable fare. Recommended.

### CityJet customer review
Cityjet planes are getting run down and not being cleaned properly. It has got worse in the last year with dirty windows you need to scrape off the grime and floors seats and magazine holder areas that often have food and waste in them. Food gets changed supposedly for the better but sandwiches dry and tasteless or just a biscuit pack or unhealthy snacks. Soon to be disposed off by KLM / Air France and hopefully the LCY-AMS and Paris Orly Routes will be taken back by KLM and AF and operated with their own crew and KLM and AF planes. They also raised the base price for a case and even just 25% of miles by £40! Not paying for this standard so starting flights with KLM proper from LHR for £99 new 737-8/900's and Embraer 190's. Also benefit from my Gold card perks of fast track separate check in priority luggage and the great Skyteam lounge at T4. Cityjet have really gone downhill the last 18 months and it gets worse.

### CityJet customer review
Flew from LCY to Dundee walked through security and the flight was delayed 40 mins due to a storm in Scotland! Boarded quickly on yo the Dornier 328 which is a delight to fly 2-1 seating with 31" seat pitch. 2 drink runs with food offered I ended up having 2 half roast beef sandwiches 3 small bottles of white wine and some a packet of nuts! Very pleasant member of cabin crew.

### CityJet customer review
Paris ORY-LCY on March 14 2013. Departure delayed 10 minutes seats are uncomfortable and staff not very efficient. During the flight they give only a very small cake. However it is convenient because it takes you directly to London City.

### CityJet customer review
LCY-AMS (as part of onward to LIN). Left on time on a windy day but were warned and soon out of the worst of it. Coffee and muffin enough for such a short flight. Bags at final destination so what more could be asked - and a reasonable price. Only very small gripe-getting very tired of these multiple flight numbers on one aircraft - there must be a better way.

### CityJet customer review
Dundee to London City with CityJet. Do the extra 50 minute drive to Edinburgh airport half the price 2x plus the service! As the other reviewer said security is very thorough but believe me a full body pat down every time you fly especially if that's every week gets just a little bit annoying. More than annoying in fact. CityJet don't even get me started on them £350 per return every time I check in I get told off for something different. Last time I was supposed to print off my boarding card before arriving even though I always check in bags and have no where to print anything at wok. Ryanair customer service at BA prices!

### CityJet customer review
Flew LUX-LCY. A very pleasant flight even if it was short. The Fokker 50 aircraft was lovely and although old and a bit falling apart was comfortable enough with plenty of legroom. Cabin crew were delightful and distributed a choice of croissant or pain au chocolate and water or orange juice half way through the flight which was nice. Captain gave announcements throughout the flight on the slightly old and crackly PA system. The inflight magazine was dull. Check in was very easy however we were charged 60 euros for 2 check in bags as we had not payed for them in advance. This is disappointing for a full service airline charging for luggage. Overall a great flight.

### CityJet customer review
First time on this airline travelling from Newcastle to Paris on AF Code-share. The flight landed on time after a very comfortable and stress-free journey. The cabin crew were very helpful in giving information regarding Paris CDG airport layout. Would not hesitate to use this airline again.

### CityJet customer review
FMO-LCY on F50 (operated by VLM). Delayed over an hour apology and reason for delay given but only once onboard (no information given at the gate). Legroom and seat comfort very good. Cabin crew left me with mixed feelings. Purser rude. Another crew member was fantastic polite and extremely friendly. Service on board consisted of full size sandwich and generous offering from trolley service (2 runs with drinks 2 runs with sandwiches chocolates all on 1 hr 20 mins flight). The only quibble was that my bag was tagged as cabin bag and was told by the purser I will be able to collect it by the aircraft stairs at LCY. In reality there is no such thing as delivery at aircraft at LCY due to airport regulations all bags tagged as delivery at aircraft are taken to the baggage reclaim.

### CityJet customer review
Air France is Europe's worst national airline for long haul. Cityjet seem to take their role of supporting their parent seriously and clearly share the same values and customer care policies - they don't have any. On a BA flight this morning after the cancellation of my Cityjet flight last nigh and what a contrast - Air France provided one agent to re-book 90 passengers and result was a 2 hour queue. They told us nothing about the problem and ignored the problems of passengers.

### CityJet customer review
LCY-FLR-LCY. Quick check-in at LCY but kept waiting 20 minutes in very small gate area before boarding . Full Avro RJ85 took off 15 minutes late. Air France crew efficient but wooden. Very tight seating and uncomfortable for tall passengers. Sandwich options for breakfast poor. Return flight boarding and take-off delayed for a variety of reasons adding up to a total of 60 minutes delay. Captain apologetic. Drinks offered (including wine) before the same poor sandwich options. Overall average but just about adequate for a 2 hr flight.

### CityJet customer review
London City-Florence return. Usual swift check-in at LCY. Half-full Avro RJ85 took off on time. Interior slightly worn but clean and seats comfortable with just about enough leg room (I'm 1.83) for the 2hr flight. Staff professional handed out drinks and sandwiches (which were adequate but which could perhaps be upgraded slightly from slightly skimpy cheese or tuna mayonnaise). The basket of complimentary Belgan chocolate squares passed round later is a nice touch though. Return flight check-in handled by Air France at Florence. For some reason AF staff insisted that queuing passengers should print out their boarding cards from automated check-ins before dropping baggage. Flight similarly smooth although delayed by about 20 minutes due to late incoming aircraft for which captain apologised. Cabin crew made a second sandwich run offering more to anyone who wanted them. Overall good flights that were less expensive and better quality than those offered by Meridiana the airline we have previously used for London-Florence trips.

### CityJet customer review
AMS to LCY- Flight was on a 95 seat Avro RJ 85. Flight left on time and was half full. This airline has great helpful crew. I was given the choice of a complementary alcoholic beverage and cheese sandwich. Went through Customs and had my bag within 20 minutes of Landing. This airline is going in the right direction. Inexpensive fares along with great service. LCY airport is the best kept secret in the UK.

### CityJet customer review
LCY-ORY-LCY. Very quick and easy on the way out from London attentive crew and plenty of croissants! Slight delay on return but time was made up and crew managed to come round twice with drinks on such a short flight. Being 6'5 leg room is always my biggest concern especially in a Fokker with no exit row seats but there was ample room for me even by the window. Will definitely choose CityJet again.

### CityJet customer review
Flew from Brive to London City and had 3.5 hr delay due to technical fault. Annoying but these things happen. What annoyed me most was the first time anyone tried to apologise was once we finally landed in London. Got a free drink though worth €3!

### CityJet customer review
LCY-AMS on KL/AF codeshare. A 146 and though seen a few miles was smart and comfortable albeit a bit noisy. Left and arrived on time. Crew very good and got refreshments out quickly on this short mid morning flight. Soft cheese roll and a coffee just fine for the 50 minutes at cruise. With well manned immigration at SPL and my bag appearing on the carousel as I reached it a good service as advertised-refreshing.

### CityJet customer review
LCY-ANR. Booked 07.35 on 26th March arrived at LCY and saw a message on my Blackberry saying the flight had been cancelled; check-in and customer service staff were clueless and seemed not to know. When I asked about the next flight I was told 'it's at 15.30' so I took the refund. When I got back to my office I noticed that there was an 08.30 flight that left at 09.00. Today's 'flight' was a shambles and reaffirms why I fly BA. Shame no one else flies between London and Antwerp!

LCY-ANR-LCY. Check-in a breeze flight on Fokker 50 very comfortable. Crew offered sandwiches chocolates and three servings of drinks on this 50 minute flight. We landed and had cleared Antwerp airport within minutes. Efficiency throughout.

### CityJet customer review
London City to Nantes. Generous complimentary food and drink service comfortable Fokker 50 and swift check- in at London City. Only negative point is that the windows on the Fokker 50 seem to have been designed only for children to look through - I'm of average height and they were far too low for me to see through without straining my back.

### CityJet customer review
BVE-LCY. Superb service into London City. Check in at Brive Airport was super quick and found myself in London in no time. The fare was reasonable and don't forget to include the saving of flying into London City and taking the DLR/tube instead of an expensive airport express train. Allocated seating luggage and drinks/snacks on board make the flight so much more pleasant than flying with a budget airline.

### CityJet customer review
AMS-LCY. Booked 3 seats for two children and adult. Gave child a window seat but there was no window. Also no space for our hand luggage as overhead compartment not big enough. Food was all right but it was very uncomfortable as no leg room.

### CityJet customer review
Unpleasant ground staff at Deauville Airport believe that it is forbidden to fly if you do not have your own completed name and address tag on your suitcase. Even after pointing out to them that the baggage check-in tag contains your name and destination they insisted on a separate baggage tag as the luggage might get lost. I did mention to them that as it was the only commercial flight of the day that I would be rather surprised if they lost it! All the time the baggage handler who looked about fourteen was shouting the one English word that he knew at me "name".

### CityJet customer review
London City to Antwerp was delayed 3 hours 40 mins not sure whether it's true that there was a technical problem as the airline claimed or whether they just cancelled the flight and let us wait for the evening flight one never knows. Got a voucher for 5£ could just buy 1 small drink with it a small packet of nuts and crisps. Were not informed at check-in about the delay so had already gone through security. Representative for cityjet at London City airport very unfriendly not even apologizing for this long delay.

EIN-LCY-EIN in F50s. The service in both directions was of the usual high quality I would expect from the old VLM CityJet routes. The cabin crew were polite and professional and even recognised and welcomed returning passengers. The captain kept us well informed of our progress. For the fare I consider this exceptionally good value; however they should encourage the ground staff at both airports to improve their attitude about keeping passengers informed.

Dundee to London City. It used to be a good service and I have always tried to support it - not anymore would rather get better service from Easyjet at a third of the price and not have any flights cancelled.

### CityJet customer review
City jet flights in France on behalf of Air France. Very impolite and icy cabin personnel. For a flight of Air France within France Cityjet (as a subsidiary of Air France) refuses to speak French whereas the flight is domestic! Most people using Air France for domestic flights in France don't care whether the flight is pure Air France or subsidiary Irish City Jet - but they don't speak english and they don't expect an Air France flight to be only in english (especially safety announcements).

### CityJet customer review
LCY to AMS (codeshare with KLM). CityJet arbitrarily decided to not include four passengers' items of checked in luggage because of weight restrictions with a small plane - they did not tell anyone so KLM at Schipol wasted everybody's time searching the basement and the transit lounge. I had to phone LCY to see what had happened as no ground staff at Schipol had any information thus I found their decision to leave bags off the plane. I had to stay in my hotel without any luggage toiletries makeup work clothes etc. overnight and pick up the bag at Schipol the next day and lost three hours from work. KLM confirmed on CityJet behalf that there would be no compensation whatsoever.

LCY-DUB-LCY. I do this route regularly and impressed by the simple touches that make this a very pleasant airline to fly - pleasant crew free drinks a small sandwich or croissant and good pricing.

### CityJet customer review
LCY-DUB. First time out of London City and it was a breeze to get to from central London. Flight on Avro RJ85 on time and very pleasant when compared to say Ryanair from LGW. Online check in good although make sure that you allocate your seats away from rows 6-8 as the overhead lockers are only good for brief cases and not wheelie weekend bags. As a result my friend’s bag was taken along with others at the departure gate and put in the hold so if you want to get a quick getaway at the other end you may want to pack a smaller bag or backpack. In flight service was good and complementary alcoholic drinks served with a sandwich. DUB-LCY. Didn’t have the chance to print my boarding pass so went to the desk who printed it off for me. On time departure to LCY professional staff. City Jet is a great service and a relaxing alternative to LGW and LHR to DUB.

### CityJet customer review
LCY-BVE-LCY check-in and boarding at LCY quick and easy. Flight delayed 45 mins due to technical issue but kept informed. Avro jet in good condition with comfortable seats and just enough space. Crew charming and efficient. Return flight absolute chaos at Brive airport. Considering it was the only flight departing you would have thought it would be a breeze. No one manning check in. Eventually dealt with by a very ruffled check-in agent. No one manning security for 30 minutes so just stood and waited. When security finally opened they went completely OTT! Everyone was frisked even though scanners not activated. Finally boarded 20 minutes after scheduled take off time to be told we'd missed our slot and would be delayed by 90 minutes!

### CityJet customer review
LCY-EDI in the evening after the ash cloud had closed EDI during the day. Good information from both the website and their customer service number about the status of the day's flights. Checked in online but the SMS boarding pass never arrived so had to use self-service machine at LCY - easy enough. Flight left a few minutes late after the crew checked that EDI had in fact reopened at 7pm as expected and arrived on time. In-flight service fairly basic but fine for an 80-minute flight. Friendly and efficient crew comfortable seats and adequate space on the Avro RJ85. Not that cheap but would fly with them again.

### CityJet customer review
London City to Dublin. First time using Cityjet and London City Airport. A great little airline. Booking the fare it was refreshing to see that the amount you first see is the amount you actually end up paying ie. no extra charges not even a 'handling' charge which is effectively a charge for nothing. My trip to the airport did not go to plan and I ended up at the airport ten minutes before departure. They advertise that you can check in up to ten minutes before departure at City and sure enough the staff got me on that flight. Although check-in had just closed the staff at the ticket counter were helpful. I had already checked in online but needed to have my boarding card printed then one of them ran with me to the gate. Given the reduction in service levels across most airlines in recent years I couldn't believe this. Flight was fine pleasant crew complementary sandwich and bar service. The crew came through the cabin several times offering drinks. Smaller aircraft made for easier boarding and disembarkation. London City a great little airport with no distance between the check-in area and the train station. Overall this was a great experience compared to Heathrow or Gatwick and the actions of the staff that evening saved me a lot of money and stress in getting me on that flight I would have had to pay for a new flight and overnight at a hotel and missed half a day's work otherwise.
