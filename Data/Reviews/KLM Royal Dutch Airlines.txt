### "Excellent service during the flight"
Flight on time, boarding efficient. Excellent service during the flight, cabin crew was receptive to my needs. Comfortable seat on the intercontinental leg, with flat bed possibility. Good drink selection. On the European leg the seats are Economy with empty middle seat, not so comfortable. Arrival on time at final destination, luggage delivery late - priority luggage arrived last.

### "Wonderful cabin crew"
Not Verified |  Great service. Helpful staff at check-in. Wonderful cabin crew. Comfortable seats. Good choice of entertainment. Some strange combinations on the food service. Would recommend taking your own head phones as only very basic ones supplied so the sound system wasn't at it's best.

### "an error with her ticket"
Not Verified |  My wife and I arrived over two hours before boarding with information on the reservation appearing correct. When she tried to get her ticket after we queued for 40 mins, she found out there was an error with her ticket so we had to queue in another line across where it was clear they were understaffed as everyone waiting was there approximately 90 mins. When we finally got to the front it took approximately 8 mins to fix the problem. At that point the boarding had started so we couldn’t make it since we were still at the start. Instead of just moving the reservation to the next available flight, we were fully charged for the tickets. So my options were to pay it, book a different airline or not get home. After writing to the company that day from the lobby (that’s the only way to address the issues according to the desk worker) I have been going back and forth for 2 weeks where I am informed that there is nothing they can do. Not reimburse, not provide credit for a different flight.

### "disgraceful customer service"
I booked tickets for my daughters 16 and 14. I contacted an online service agent to make sure I didn't need anything else. They said only a consent form. I asked if we needed unaccompanied minor service for my younger daughter and they said no. Upon arrival at the airport my younger daughter was refused boarding unless we booked UM service. So at 3am at checkin we had to see if we could arrange this as it needed to be booked 24 hours in advance. We were first quoted £614 then £670 (absolutely extortionate) then upon paying it was £498, clearly even they don't know what they are doing. I complained to KLM requesting a refund as we were advised incorrectly. They refused despite the fact that I went on what the online agent had advised me. On checking on their return flight I could only find my older daughters booking. My younger daughter has now been booked on a completely different booking number, they have changed their seats and they are no longer sitting together. Just disgraceful customer service and misinformation. Will never use KLM again. Fellow travellers be warning. Anything goes wrong and they will not help you or refund you for them inconveniencing you.

### "They rejected the complaint"
My flight was supposed to leave Amsterdam at 20:30 and land in Rome at 22:45. The flight was delayed due to problems with another plane in the morning. They had the whole day to organize, but we waited even longer because the crew was not at the airport yet. Did they do anything while we waited more than 2 hours, like serve us a decent meal or even a soda? No. The plane landed in Rome at 1:00 am. I had to pay for a taxi to get home because there are no other options that late. They rejected the complaint because it was less than 3 hours late - and I can still live with that, even if that late in the night, 2.15 hours make a huge difference - but they even refused to refund the price I paid for the taxi because the document I sent them (which included the date, the hour, the amount, the name of the service provider, the place where he registered his activity and the service used for the digital payment) was not compliant.

### "I missed my flight"
Not Verified |  I don’t get why that I have to pay rebooking fee for the failure of your system to generate a ticket after I paid for it. I missed my flight and had to pay transportation and accommodation due to something that they can remedy by rebooking you until next flight charge free. Ground check-in staff have no autonomy to fix the issue and some were unwilling to help.

### "attentive and proactive"
Flight number KL1514, 15th April 2025. Just wanted to take this opportunity to thank Wovter, for his amazing service, brilliant communication, friendly, attentive and proactive attitude. He revived my faith in good customer service in Economy class.

### "expected fairer compensation"
Unfortunately, my baggage was lost during a KLM flight. While the staff was polite and the process was explained clearly, I was only compensated for about half of the actual value of my lost items. I followed all the procedures and submitted all required documents. It was a disappointing experience, and I expected fairer compensation.

### "Everything went smoothly"
Brand new Embraer. So silent. Everything went smoothly. Nice choice of drinks, and a sandwich, with a very strange taste however. Nothing to complain, on the contrary. Wi-fi, for messages only, for free and worked perfectly.

### "I would not recommend KLM"
We travelled KLM Glasgow to Amsterdam. Outgoing flight was good, however on our return the flights was delayed, then there was an issue with the aircraft and we were assigned a different gate. By this time the flight was over an hour late. Then however we were notified by SMA that our seats had been removed as the aircraft was too small to seat our original passenger count. KLM provided no way of getting us home at all that day. This caused us a lot of stress as we had no childcare arrangements for our kids that evening and meant we missed important work arrangements and a family funeral the next morning. KLM were extremely unsympathetic to our situation at the time and in the ensuing communication. I would not recommend KLM as they are not reliable. I will not be flying KLM in future.

### "does not give lounge access"
Even with a Business Class ticket, Lounge access was not provided at AMS airport and the staff said it’s a cheap ticket. Absolutely ridiculous  - which airline does not give lounge access to business class travellers.

### "never again fly with KLM"
I have flown a few times with KLM and each time the planning and connecting flight with KLM or connecting at Schiphol airport has been a nightmare. There was always a delay either boarding or departing from the plane. I also used KLM during a connecting flight and my luggage was lost. KLM and connecting flight Transavia have been terrible to deal with after the fact whilst trying to get compensation for my lost luggage that still hasnt been received - 74 days after my trip. Will never again fly with KLM

### "Horrible customer service"
Terrible experience, flight delays and cancellations meant we had to spend two days in Amsterdam in a bad airport hotel and arrived over 48 hours later than planned to our destination. They also lost of children’s car seat which arrived a further two days later causing immense stress and inconvenience. All of this and they refused any compensation or reimbursement besides the hotel and meals for the delay in Amsterdam. Horrible customer service and one of the worst travel experiences I’ve had.

### “changed my seat"
KLM, you are a disgrace. Two flights today and for both flights I booked and paid for my choice of seat. I got as far as going to board the first flight only for my boarding pass not to work, the reason being you had changed my seat and put me in a seat further back, in a lesser category seat. No problem with my original seat itself as someone else was sitting in it. When I got to the lounge at AMS I thought I had better check my seat for the next flight only to find out you had kicked me out of my carefully chosen seat for that one as well. What are you playing act? 1

### “Nobody even answered my email”
Not Verified | I am really disappointed with KLM. I had a miscarriage a day before my flight and couldn't fly. I paid for my ticket 1241 euros and asked KLM to be considerate and give me a refund or a chance to use the amount for another flight. I attached the medical documentation I had. They returned 164 euros without any explanation. Nobody even answered my email. I don't think this is a way to run a business and expect customers to choose their company again.

### "My luggage was not loaded"
Heartbroken and completely disappointed with KLM I am writing this review with deep sadness and frustration. My friends and I meticulously planned a three-night trip to Las Vegas, each day and night with a special theme. I spent months carefully choosing and purchasing outfits to match each occasion, only for KLM to completely ruin this experience for me. My luggage was not loaded onto the plane from Dublin to Amsterdam, and despite multiple assurances, it has still not arrived. Today is the final night of my trip, the grand gala evening I was most excited about, and my luggage—containing my final outfit—is still missing. KLM emailed me this morning at 11 AM confirming my luggage had arrived at my final destination and would be delivered to my hotel today. It is now 8 PM, and there is still no sign of it. I am in tears. A trip I invested so much time, effort, and money into has been completely ruined because of KLM’s sheer incompetence. I paid in full for this service, and in return, I have experienced nothing but stress, disappointment, and frustration. I will never fly with KLM again, and I sincerely hope someone from the airline actually takes the time to read this and understand the emotional toll their negligence can have on a passenger. This wasn’t just a lost bag—this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that KLM took away from me. Absolutely unacceptable.

### “customer service is unhelpful, dismissive”
Not Verified | Terrible Experience with KLM Airlines – Never Again! I had an absolutely dreadful experience with KLM Airlines, and I feel compelled to warn others. First, they delayed the delivery of my baggage, leaving me stranded without my belongings for days. To make matters worse, when my luggage finally arrived, it was damaged beyond repair. The lack of care and accountability is shocking! Their customer service is the absolute worst – unhelpful, dismissive, and utterly lacking in honesty. They made promises to resolve the issue but did nothing. I was constantly redirected, ignored, and left in limbo with no resolution in sight. It felt like they couldn’t care less about their customers. KLM’s operations are disorganized, their communication is non-existent, and their treatment of passengers is unacceptable. I do not recommend this airline to anyone. If you value your time, money, and belongings, choose a more reliable and trustworthy airline. Save yourself the headache and avoid KLM at all costs!

### “Competent and efficient flights”
Not Verified | Competent and efficient flights. Delay in Geneva handled well, captain came to boarding gate to explain. Comfort” seats had good leg room even on a 737. A sandwich and drink served on each flight of just over an hour.

### "they changed it to lousy seats"
Not Verified |  I chose the seats and on the actual day of flying, they replaced it without letting me know. So from good seats that I chose, they changed it to lousy seats. That's disgraceful and a scam. Imagine if I paid for those seats and they change it to a noisier one, and all they do is to apologise.

### "an amazing experience"
Not Verified |  It was an amazing experience. I was very nervous flying with 2 year old but they took great care of my baby and gave me extra seat in every flight. Crew was helpful in every way. They managed to do boarding of my kid with business class and treat me as priority due to kid which I find extremely thankful. Also best part was the flying experience. I will fly with them highly highly recommended

### "Really not worth the price"
I flew to Entebbe from Amsterdam on 12th December and back on 29th December. On the outward flight my seat wasn't working properly and could only be reclined manually by the cabin staff on request. By a fortunate coincidence it was a day flight and I spent most of it reading, so I didn't need to recline. However, the overhead light shone on my knees as opposed to on my book, and when I tried to use the reading light it turned out that wasn't working either. I was saved by the kindness of the man in the seat next to me who raised his window blind to allow in some daylight despite the glare on his computer screen. The cabin staff was very apologetic and offered to refund a small part of the seat cost, which I appreciated. There was no point in upbraiding her since she was not at fault; the bean-counter somewhere in Amsterdam whose policy it is to sell defective seats come what may is, of course, anonymous, inaccessible, and protected from customer frustration. On the return (night) flight I had some experience of what I thought I'd missed. The 'bed' was so narrow that it was impossible to put your arms anywhere but by your sides, and changing position was almost impossible. It made for an incredibly uncomfortable night. There is no divider between the two seats, and virtually no privacy. Really not worth the price of a Business Class ticket. The meals were adequate, but that was all. And the choice of entertainment - not that I used it except while I was eating - was, I have to say, absolutely appalling. Service was friendly and efficient, and I always feel I'm in safe hands on a KLM flight. I have to say though that the quality of their business class offering has deteriorated considerably over the last few years, to the point where I would think twice before using it again. I feel sorry for the crews who have to justify the unjustifiable, and I fear the airline will lose custom - including mine - if it continues like this. I hope things will improve, but for the moment, flying business in KLM reminds me of the early days of British Airways' race to the bottom. I no longer fly with them; I do hope KLM will rethink its current approach so that I won't have to decide to abandon them too. They used to be on of my favourite airlines for long-haul flights. I'd like them to remain so.

### "definitely not kids oriented"
Some of the flight crew have terrible attitude and KLM is definitely not kids oriented. The cabin staff on KL836 was rude and hostile when our child was crying non stop during take off. She was mean and offered no help. Even offering amenities was rude and did not greet us when we came onboard or disembark flight. We felt super not welcomed like we are intruding her private zen space. KLM should retrain some  aircrew to have more compassion and customer oriented. Some of the male aircrew was friendly and was smiling.

### "Stingy, patronising behaviour"
Flew MUC-AMS-CPH mid December 2024 on small aircrafts, E175 and B737-700. Easy to buy ticket; check-in in MUC was quick. SkyTeam lounge access (granted due to status) in MUC is small but fine, including 2 types of nice German draft beers. Onboard, got my dream seats, had a nice transit in AMS, Crown Lounge (gate 25) is impressive, world class, and delivers. However, their impressive foods I hard to gather as plates, glasses, soup bowls, are microscopic: max. size of a plate is 15 cm in diameter, bowls are 8 cm which is less than a teacup and those of prisons. No trays are offered, and one has to run up and down eternally to become full. The KLMs cost saving measures compromises their global ambitions. Service onboard is minimalistic compared to other Skyteam airlines that typically offer you two drinks when ordering one. KLM will only give you maximum 1 drink at a time, and further downsizes all items. They pour liquids from cans in plastic glasses to retain the cans and drops for next passengers. Stingy, patronising behaviour. Beers are not offered, except the industrial Heineken presented in minimalistic 25 cl-cans. You may get an additional upon request by kneeling or begging. Flight on time. FA effective and fairly kind. For catering, consider Air France, Virgin, or Kenya Airways instead.

### "Reliable, almost on time"
Flew CPH-AMS-MUC and back mid December 2024 on narrowbody aircrafts. Easy to buy ticket; check in took 30 seconds in CPH airport. Lounge access in CPH, as Skyteam Elite Plus holder, now constitute three options, including the ambient SAS Gold Lounge. In Amsterdam, the KLM Lounge in Schengen area (at gate 25) is much better than any of the CPH lounges. Lots of nice food, drinks and facilities, biggest drawback is that they close the lounge during the entire night. Onboard, my high status in their Flying Blue program was strongly recognised, with a handwritten, personalised postcard from staff welcoming me at my seat; nice touch. Catering onboard in economy is offered and is appreciated: it’s not very common in Europe these days. However, food was subpar: only an ice-cold sandwich, take it or leave it. Drinks onboard do not include any spirits apart from wine and beers. The staff are, as usual for KLM, very stingy with drink supplies and refuse to bring more than one drink at the time, what a nuisance. Try Kenya Airways, they always give 2 drinks when ordering one. KLM give one when you order two. And, the beers are microscopic in size, 25cl only. Onboard, no WiFi, no IFE, and no power outlets. I got my reserved exit row seats throughout on all four flights, these are quite spacious and beat their business class seats. Reliable, almost on time. Got miles and XPs to Flying Blue instantly.

### "string me along until I tire of complaining"
I flew with KLM on 11 December from Stockholm to Marseilles via Amsterdam. My baggage was not loaded on the plane to Marseilles but was left in Amsterdam. I actually wasn't going to have any check-in baggage, but I received an sms from KLM on the morning of the flight which said "We need to update some of your details before boarding. Please report to an agent at the Customer Service Desk. When I went to the desk, I discovered that they didn't need any information from me, they only wanted to check in my hand baggage due to the fact that the airplane didn't have room for all the hand baggage. KLM even had the nerve to try and sell this trickery by making it seem like a special offer, "check in your baggage free of charge". Of course I wouldn't have written this review unless KLM had lost my baggage in Amsterdam, but the fact that they fooled me into checking in my baggage in the first place makes what happened so much worse. When I arrived in Marseilles at 16:30, my baggage didn't appear on the conveyor belt. When all the other passengers had left, an airport service person approached me and asked if I was looking for my bag. She then showed me a list of the passengers with my name highlighted. She told me that my bag was still in Amsterdam and that it would arrive with a plane at around 23:00. It would then be delivered to my hotel in Aix-en-Provence around noon the next day (which is the day I am writing this review). She also told to fill in a form on the KLM website, which I did promptly. Something odd happened when I filled in the form, I specifically entered 12 December as the last date of delivery, since I will be leaving Aix early on 13 December. I checked very carefully that I entered the correct date, but when I got the confirmation of my report, it said that the last date of delivery was 11 December, i.e. the day I arrived, which of course would be impossible since the bag wouldn't arrive in Marseilles until 23:00 that day. I clicked "back" on the site and came back to the field where I had entered the date and there it said 12/12. But when I checked the confirmation again, it said 11/12. I panicked a little because I really needed my bag, and I tried to simultaneously contact KLM via their WhatsApp chat and the phone number to Customer Service. On both channels I was greeted by a robot, which I eventually managed to bypass and reach a human, although for the chat I'm still not convinced that I have actually talked to a human. Anyway, I finally succeeded in making the person I talked to on the phone change the date to 12/12. She said that I would certainly receive my bag in Aix the next day, although she couldn't say at what time. Now I started chatting with the human service agent on the KLM WhatsApp to get updates on when my bag would arrive. I have done this repeatedly all day today, but I keep getting messages like this: "I understand the urgency of this matter. As advised, you will be contacted directly once another update regarding the delivery of your baggage is available. Your understanding is much appreciated. However, KLM clearly has no intention to bring me my baggage before I leave for home, they are just trying to string me along until I grow tired of complaining. This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered and I advise anyone reading this to avoid KLM at all cost.

### “overbooked the flight - not my fault”
Because I was in zone 5, I was FORCED to check my carry on with all of my medication, contact lenses, back pain control machine, etc. They told me they overbooked the small flight to Amsterdam that connects to my Toronto flight and refused to allow me to check it at the gate in order to get it back for the bigger flight. They were rude about it and didn’t care at all that I needed my medication and stuff. They suggested I pay $150 to sit in “business class”. There is no business class. It’s a slightly larger seat on a tiny puddle hopper plane. So obviously there WAS overhead room, I just wasn’t “first class” enough to be given any overhead space. Most airlines call out and ask for volunteers. They overbooked the flight - that’s not my fault. My fiancée was happy to check his. I just needed mine, and they were unaccommodating and ruined my trip home.

### "avoid this airline in the future"
Not Verified |  I had a Copenhagen to New York flight with 1.5 hours transit in Amsterdam which I thought was plenty of time. The scheduled departure from Copenhagen was 2:10pm that day. The flight was delayed by 35 minutes to 2:45pm, meaning I only had 55 minutes in transit left in Amsterdam. The gate was assigned at the last minute and it was a 12 minute walk from where I was with my heavy luggage and backpack I thought that was bad until I found out my flight was further delayed by 25 minutes to 3:10pm and the gate was changed again to another 12 minutes walking distance away. The actual departure was another 10 minutes late. None of the staff gave a clear reason as to why all the delays. The weather in both Copenhagen and Amsterdam was cloudy but none that could prevent any flight to take off or land. My connecting flight to New York in Amsterdam still left on schedule at 5:05pm that day. Weather was definitely not an issue. By the time we arrived in Amsterdam we still had to take a bus transport to the terminal and ran to the gate only to find out the door had closed at 4:55pm, 10 minutes before scheduled departure We can still see the plane at the gate. With all these delays I was curious why KLM did not wait for all connecting passengers who were late not because of their fault ? ? Many airlines do so. A lot of passengers were screaming at the staff at that gate but I tried to stay cool. I found out later on there where tons of passengers missing their connecting flights that day. This was not my first bad experience with KLM but with this horrible experience for sure I would avoid this airline in the future. Avoid KLM at all cost.

### “sandwich or piece of cake was offered”
Not Verified | Very surprised by the flight and service, for this short flight a sandwich or piece of cake was offered, flight departed a bit late which meant that people connecting were going to have an issue. Cabin crew asked everyone to remain seated so those with tight connections could deplane and get to the terminal, being on a remote stand this could be a problem. Once those got off everyone else was allowed to get off, the funny thing is those that got off first were stuck on the bus waiting for us and we’re now squashed in the back as everyone else piled on, sorta defeating the purpose.

### "a pathetic airline"
KLM is a pathetic airline. I arrived at the airport at 4:45am. I was suppose to reach my destination at 1:30, then 6:30 but reached my destination at 11:00pm due to a cancellation, misbooking and a delay. All in the same day. At 4:30am that morning, on the train to the airport I receive a notification that my flight at 6:00 am was cancelled and they had rebooked me for 6:45 am. I see my new itinerary in my app and I load my new boarding passes in my phone. At the gate my boarding pass did not work. The lady at the gate said I was not on that flight and there wasn’t enough time to book it because the plane needed to take off in 10 min so they left without me. She’s useless. KLM customer service number didn’t open till 9am. I go back to check-in. The fourth person I talked to at checkin actually helped me and put me on the next flight at 11:50 am. My new first flight was delayed 50 min and my next connection was 45 min so I missed my next flight and had to be rebooked again(third time today before lunch). Loading the plane took so long because the plane had to be loaded in a special way that did not „tip it over“ because the weight of the plane was off. I successfully made my next to flights. I was given a meal voucher in my app for my trouble that never would load. In summary, I arrived at the airport at 4:45am. I was suppose to reach my destination at 1:30, then 6:30 but reached my destination at 11:00pm due to a cancellation, misbooking and a delay. All in the same day.

### "never recommend this airline"
My flight was from Cork to Zurich via Amsterdam. Initially both of flights were delayed and gave me alternative flights. The worst part is even alternative flights got delayed. Too worst airlines. I would never recommend this airline.

### “Sorry I didn't read reviews first”
Never booked with them before. Sorry I didn't read reviews first. My 7:40pm home flight was cancelled. A KLM staff member stood in front of myself and other passengers and said that we should go away and book a hotel with dinner and breakfast and KLM will refund us. We should book a hotel and get dinner and breakfast because we won't know when a flight will be. She said we wouldn't get our suitcases and we can go to the shops to buy knew stuff. Whether it was cosmetics, medicines or clothes. There's shops for everything. I spent an additional nearly 500€ because of the hotel and food and they sent us on a flight to another country before going back to my home country. Then KLM never actually gave the 2nd flight our suitcases. They said they wouldn't compensate because of gusty winds. Then told me they won't compensate because I don't have real receipts. They don't care that I was following the instructions of a KLM staff member. They haven't even compensated the hotel part which cost me the most and only for a few hours because the next 6:50 am the next day. They sent a 50€ voucher code for my birthday. Then they say they'll welcome my custom any time. A KLM staff member said we would be refunded for the inconvenience.

### “does not care about their customers”
Extremely disappointed at KLM! To begin with, they do not allow even one check-in luggage, which, for an international flight, is absurd! They charged me $150 for the first check-in bag. Our first flight was delayed and arrived late to Amsterdam, but we barely made our connecting flight, once in Milan, after waiting for my luggage for half an hour, and barely finding our way to "lost and found" we were told our luggage would arrive the next day. The airline did not communicate that to us, even though they had our emails. At "lost and found" they provided us claim information so we could get a refund, not mentioning anything that the claim would have to be filed within 21 days. We were then informed that even though the luggage would get there the next morning, they had no driver to deliver it to us until night time, or the day after! That would mean we would not have any clothes or toiletries for 3 days. We ended up paying 190 Euros for driver's wait time and to have another pick up our luggage the next morning. We got back home on 9/28. I tried to file the claim on October 1, but KLM's system had a glitch and could not find my trip. Then I called your customer service number to get some assistance. I was on hold for over an hour and then got cut off!!! I proceeded to file a claim on October 2 (which was within 21 days), through the email I received regarding the purchase of my extra baggage. The system was still very glitchy and would not accept all my documents. The claim was denied on 10/6 claiming the document was used, which was extremely confusing. On 10/7 I tried again and successfully filed my claim. However, KLM denied my claim citing that it was past the 21 days!! I explained that I did file it in time as explained above, but without any explanation, they just repeated that they are denying the claim! KLM certainly does not care about their customers. I will never trust them and if I can help it, I'll go out of my way to never fly with them again.

### "never again in business class with KLM"
During the flight, there was only one option available for the main course for both my wife and me, even though three options are normally offered. We had both hoped to try the local tasting menu, but unfortunately, we had to settle for a chicken dish. The crew mentioned that this shortage happens often, which we find difficult to understand, especially for a business class experience. A similar issue arose with the dessert. We both wanted the cheese platter, but this was also no longer available. Instead, we were offered a sweet option, which we were not interested in. When my wife mentioned this, the crew laughed it off and suggested she take some extra chocolates with her tea. This offer contradicted our clear preference for a non-sweet dessert. Upon submitting an official complaint, we received only a generic response. One time and never again in business class with KLM. We’ve never experienced anything like this with other airlines.

### "I had a pleasant flight"
Not Verified | Despite the fact the plane was really full, I had a pleasant flight. Flights attendant were excellent, cared for their passengers and were in great spirit. It changes the ambiance in a plane. I ordered an Indonesian meal at 22 euros. It also changed from the " pasta or chicken". Very good. But I do not recommend a 11 hours day flight.

### “flight attendants were fantastic”
KLM was a very pleasant and reliable airline. They served us like Kings/Queens, the food was pleasantly very good & served us often. My luggage arrived on time and safely. The flight attendants were fantastic. They provided a blanked & pillow! I lucked out and the 2 seats beside me were open/free as the passengers did not make their flight. I had the entire row to myself for 8 hours!! YES. I highly recommend this airline. Thank you Pilots for our save flight and arrival to my destination!

### "the very best cabin service"
I experienced the very best cabin service recently on my flight from Amsterdam to UIO. I originated in DUB and connected to AMS. My flight # was KL 755. Her name is Julia and is based in Amsterdam I believe. She was thoughtful, always available, paying attention to cleanliness, and so friendly. She helped me out a lot at UIO with a situation I had. I would love to fly KLM business class with Julia again!

### "shameless baggage service"
On September 19, the flight KL 686 had a delay on its departure. Instead of 20:50 it departed at about 21:40 When it arrived in AMS our connecting flight to FCO had already departed This happens frequently and therefore KLM has systematized support for its passengers at T2 Transfer desk. There, the employees told us that my documented suitcase would be put on the same plane where I would be and therefore it would arrive together with me. This did not happen. The T2 employees booked a flight to FCO early next morning. And arranged a hotel near the airport. Until that moment everything seemed fine. When we arrived in FCO my suitcase did not arrive. Aviapartner baggage tracking service together with KLM offer a completely negligent, careless, unprofessional and unreliable service to bring back suitcases. One can track where it is but they move nothing to make it arrive where passengers are. Thanks to this unbelievable bad service, I spent 1 week without my personal items, my clothes, my medication and my notebooks to do my work. Thanks to this shameless device I had to buy clothes and had to spent long hours sending emails and making phone calls instead of spending my time as scheduled. When it finally arrived where I was staying, about to make check out, KLM didn't even sent me a single apology nor even a gratification for the trouble it had caused me due to its shameless baggage service.

### "lack of care I received"
I have no particular comments about the flight. Everything was as it should be. My complaint is about the absolute lack of care I received from KLM towards my suitcase. The woman employee at the check in counter of KLM in Fiumicino airport forced me to document my bag even though if I had the right to carry it on with me. Mine is a soft compact suitcase specially designed to carry in the plane cabin. It measures 55 X 40 X 23 cm My suitcase arrived completely wet. My clothes were wet and all my items were wet. All the gifts I had bought in Florence that were made of paper, were completely damaged. The stationery and all the Florentine beautiful note books I carried inside were damaged. They must have left if they left it unattended under the rain.

### "no announcement nor an apology"
The In-flight entertainment and WiFi system was down throughout the flight. There is no announcement nor an apology before and after the flight took off. It is also ridiculous for the pilot to mention "Hope you enjoy your flight with us" made in his announcement before landing. Again, there is no apology nor explanation to the passengers for the broken service. The air hostess lacked the basic courtesy and decency to ask whether my tray could be cleared while i am still having my bread and coffee.

### “very helpful with a pleasant attitude”
Not Verified | I would like you to know about the pleasant experience I had on the above mentioned flight from Singapore to Amsterdam on September 29th, 2024. I was traveling with my childhood friend from Hungary. We had our seats far away from each other and I was worried that my friend's inability to speak any foreign languages makes her long flight rather unpleasant. I was talking to one of the flight attendants on board to see if there is any chance to bring my friend to a close seat to keep her company through the journey. A young lady named Lisa Toth (flight attendant, KLM) was very helpful with a pleasant attitude to help us to solve our problem...successfully.

### "Top marks for being constantly late"
No worse than the rest of the pack but for me being on time is a big plus and KLM can’t be trusted if you have a connecting flight or you are on a tight schedule. Top marks for being constantly late

### "very upset with this airline"
I am very upset with this airline! I booked a flight with KLM airlines months ago. It was all paid for my seat was selected all good to go. I leave in 11 days and I just got a message from KLM that they have moved my seat for "Operational reasons" The new seat is at the back of the plane right outside the bathroom! So what happened is they decided that the seat that I had had for months was now going to be a paid for seat. $85.50 There is no one in the seat it is empty. I called KLM and waited on hold for an hour only to be told that they only had to give me a seat similar to the one I had originally picked and that the new seat was the only window seat left!! Ya I guess when they make changes at the last minute! They refused to allow me to have my original seat for free.

### “flights went smooth and timely”
CPH-AMS-ZRH on 22-23 August 2024 on B737-8 and E295, respectively. Ticket was cheap and easily done, but I had to sleep over in AMS airport to catch my morning flight ab AMS. Arrived in CPH airport early, the KLM ground staff were gorgeous and offered me options on luggage: Upon discussions, they allowed me to check in luggage all the way to Rwanda despite having a complicated routing of six legs traveling (3 airlines; 3 different tickets). The long journey ahead went smooth, nicely done by KLM. As I have FFP status they gave me Fast Track access reducing entrance time to airside by 25 minutes. I killed 5 hours of time in the Skyteam lounges in CPH - they subscribe on two, which give options for lounge changes. Both flights went smooth and timely with full onboard services and chosen favorite seats. Crown lounge at gate 25 in Amsterdam provided shower, breakfast, and tranquility before proceeding to Zurich. Huge legroom in exit seats in both aircrafts; acceptable, minimal catering provided by fresh and friendly staff. Landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Perfect, timely announcements in airport and ahead. No IFE and WiFi not really working. Miles to Flying Blue inserted instantly. Extremely cheap ticket lifted up by elite status in the Flying Blue Program. Will fly again.

### "staff were cold and unsympathetic"
Not Verified | My flight from Budapest to Amsterdam was canceled. They put us on the next available flight which would have us flying from Budapest to Warsaw, transferring, then Warsaw to Amsterdam. What should have been a direct 1-and-a-half-hour flight turned into a 4-and-a-half hours of travel time. The KLM service desk booked us a hotel and paid for a taxi to take us there. When we arrived we found out that KLM did not actually book us a room, and this was the same for about 5 other groups. It was almost midnight and many of us were stranded without a room. The hotel mentioned there were not enough rooms to accommodate all of us, and because of this, I had to pack out of my pocket. This whole situation was a nightmare, and extremely stressful. KLM handled it poorly and was extremely unprofessional. This is not what I paid for or signed up for, and all of their staff representatives were cold and unsympathetic. I recommend paying more to not get treated like garbage.

### "cancelled my return flight"
I’m beyond frustrated with KLM. I had a flight on Air France from Edinburgh to Tokyo, but a few hours before I was supposed to leave, there was an earthquake and tsunami warning for Japan. I didn’t want to risk it, so I tried to contact KLM to see what my options were. They refused to help because their system didn’t show anything wrong. They still flew to Japan. I totally understand but I requested them to refund me and they refused. Because I didn’t take the outbound flight they cancelled my return flight unless I paid a ridiculous fee - €500 for intercontinental flights in Economy Class. I’d recommend staying away from this airline. It’s not worth the hassle or the risk.

### "did not give me the seat I bought"
An airline with poor service and poor morals. They do not respect the passenger. Unfortunately they cheated me and did not give me the seat I bought on the round trip. Seats 63A 63k

### "charge between €150-450 for a seat"
How can KLM charge between €150-450 for a seat? Also one should be allowed to choose their seat for free at least 24 hours prior to departure. It’s really an abuse to charge that amount of money for a seat. I will never travel KLM again.

### "an exceptional experience"
We recently flew with KLM Airlines and had an exceptional experience from start to finish. The staff at check-in were incredibly friendly and made the process smooth and easy. I was pleasantly surprised by the on-time boarding, which is something you don’t see very often with other airlines. What truly stood out was the thoughtful gesture by the on-board staff—they made a personalized birthday card for my wife, which absolutely made her morning. It’s these little touches that make KLM a top choice for me.

### "an absolute mess made by KLM"
Not Verified |  We travelled on KL597 from AMS to CPT on Sunday 29 July 2024. Cape Town airport was closed from around 20h00 to 01h00 because of an electricity issue. We were supposed to land at 21h30, so KL597 was diverted to Johannesburg. What followed was an absolute mess made by KLM. I have unfortunately been on diverted flights many times before, but it was always handled much better by other airlines. 25minutes prior to landing (~10.5 hours into the flight), the in-flight tracking system showed that the aircraft turned to Johannesburg and the ETA had increased by an hour. No word from the pilot. Passengers started asking cabin crew for info., which they did not provide. After ~10 minutes, the pilot explained that CPT airport was experiencing power issues and that we were headed for JNB instead. The pilot promised that KLM would take care of us. There was sufficient time to prepare. Landed around 22h25, and held in the plane until 01h00, with no water or meal service or any kind of attention by the cabin crew. We did not see them again until we departed the aircraft. Waited for passenger busses to disembark (not ready). We received no details about what to do once we had departed the aircraft. Immigration control went quite smoothly. At baggage claim, we found two small kiosks where KLM staff were talking to individual passengers at a time. After standing in a large ground (no lines) for a while, they directed us to first retrieve our baggage. Baggage took a long time to arrive. We then entered the long, slow queue at the kiosks around 02h00. No water, no information shared with the group, etc. Only 3 KLM staff were writing down names against hotels. Four more staff were standing around. We asked them to help, but they were obtuse and rude. Clearly “not my job”. The KLM flight crew left the airport directly after arrival, and did not assist any further. Once we were assigned a hotel, we were directed outside in 0 deg C weather (we were all completely unprepared for this!) to queue for shuttles to the hotels. Elderly people and families with children were saying that they are unable to wait outside in the cold, but ground staff shrugged their shoulders. Still no water in sight. We decided to call an Uber. When we arrived at the hotel (City Lodge), there was another long queue, and a single person at the check-in desk handling a large number of customers. No KLM ground staff in sight, so two passengers helped by collecting documents, and check-in details and translating for passengers. The hotel informed us that they had a drinking water issue, but they directed us to water at 04h00 when we received our room key. On Monday 30 July we did not hear from KLM, so we tried to call the local KLM call center, without luck. Waiting times were too long. We then tried the KLM WhatsApp channel. When I eventually reached a human, this person did not understand our situation and could only tell that our flight was “delayed”. By 11h00 we booked our own tickets to CPT. Only by 15h40 did KLM contact us by email for the first time with info. Far too late! Contact links in the email did not work. KLM booked us to depart Johannesburg only at 21h30 in the evening! On the same aircraft that had been diverted. Saving them money at the cost of our time and inconvenience. We used KLM's WhatsApp again, to find the KLM rep. there warning us to be on the 21h30 flight or be marked as a “no show”, with supposed consequences.

### "KLM never again"
On Sunday, 14/07/24, we noticed that my boyfriends passport had expired. We then called KLM and they told us that we were not allowed to cancel the flight, since then the return flight would also have to be cancelled. They told us that we only had to pay a one-time fine. On 15/07/24, my boyfriend could not travel with us because of his expired passport. He solved this problem by applying for his passport on the same day and then taking the Eurostar to London and continuing by train to Birmingham. At check-in in Amsterdam, KLM informed us that my boyfriend would have to pay a fine of €140 to take the return flight from Birmingham to Amsterdam. We had already paid this fine to KLM on the spot at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. On 19/07/24, my boyfriend was required by KLM in Birmingham to pay another €125 fine before he would receive a boarding pass, even though we had already paid the earlier fine in Amsterdam. Since he would otherwise not be allowed on the flight, we paid this fine as well. After our luggage was checked in and we went through customs, we received an e-mail at 7:21 p.m. that the flight had been canceled right after we checked in. The flight was scheduled to leave at 8:15 pm. At KLM's service desk at Birmingham Airport, we received no further assistance and had to find our own solution. As a result, we independently booked a hotel with breakfast. Later that evening we received an e-mail that an alternative flight had been booked for Monday, 22/07/24 at 5:55 am via Frankfurt to Amsterdam. However, this was not feasible for us as we needed to be home the next day. We therefore arranged our own transportation and traveled by Uber to Birmingham International on 20/07/24, then by train to London Euston and then by Eurostar from London St. Pancras to Brussels South. On Saturday, 20/07/24, we also hung on the line for a total of 2.5 hours with a KLM hold tone until we finally got a hold of someone. At 12:26 we finally got someone on the line. We wanted to cancel the new flights via Frankfurt to Amsterdam. The employee we got on the line said this would be arranged. However, the next day it turned out that this was still not taken care of and we supposedly still had to check in for the new flight. So we had to contact KLM's service line again. We incurred a total of €1798 in costs. This is unacceptable — the extra expenses we had to cover, the lack of assistance we received, and my boyfriend having to pay fines for flights he never took. KLM never again!

### "would not issue my boarding pass"
I cannot stand for long and I cannot carry weights. For this reason, I packed a 5kg suitcase to take with me. I checked-in online, but KLM would not issue my boarding pass. At the airport, I was told by assistance they could not help, and I had to queue. I've queued for 50' and now have a severe pain on my hip. Also, they refused to issue the boarding pass if I did not leave my suitcase, so I am now carrying the weight my health condition does not allow me to and KLM is transporting my empty suitcase. I hope they are happy!

### "a flight that did not happen"
Not Verified |   This review is about a flight that did not happen for me and my family. In March I booked via the KLM website a flight to Jakarta and prepaid roughly 7600 Euros. After receipt of the order confirmation I paid the price of the ticket two days later via bank transfer. Two days after payment another booking confirmation was sent making me believe that everything is set. When I was today trying to check in with the confirmation number, the website told me that the booking does not exist. There was no phone hotline available, always busy when calling and AI at Whatsapp not really helpful but just asking for patience and talking about updates that never arrived. After reaching finally a real agent in the evening, I was told that some 50 EUR payment were missing for a seat reservation. That is why KLM cancelled the reservation of the flight, but never informed about payment discrepancies, nor the thread of a cancellation of the flight, but they kept the money for 3 1/2 month since the booking! I have been flying KLM for more than 20 years - most of the time Flying Blue Gold and for 9 years even Platinum member. But they treat their most faithful customer like garbage. That behaviour is so shocking that I will never chose this airline again and delete my flying blue account. This airline is a disgrace for the industry.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service: 4 days ago we arrived at our destination without our luggage. Despite the promises online or at the airport, there still is no sign of our luggage. We tried several channels, but are constantly asked to wait patiently. The customer service is poor and insufficient. This situation is exhausting, frustrating and not acceptable after having booked and expensive flight with luggage.

### "nice KLM Crown Lounge 52"
AMS-ZRH 27/6 2024 on a small Boeing 737. This was the end-leg of a Kenya Airways 3-legs ticket. KLM handled transfer smooth and luggage correct, and granted lounge access. Long walks in Schipol, took me half hour to walk the 2-3 km. Departed briefly on time, a half hour delay was clearly and honestly informed. But being given an exit seat with large front space, I felt valued as FB elite holder. Full flight. Not much premium feeling by flying economy on legacy carrier in Europe any more. However, KLM still serves proper sandwiches and at least a single, full drink-round. Crew effective, though not sociable, merely superficially friendly. Convenient and quick airbridge barking and disembarking despite full flight. Eventless flight, boring, but no really fault. Score shall be 6 but must add 1 point for the nice KLM Crown Lounge 52.

### “An absolute disgrace”
Not Verified | An absolute disgrace. Booked flights to Kuala Lumpur via Expedia. Thought I had premium comfort, but no. They have about 100 different premiums (economy, comfort, light etc). So I contacted KLM to upgrade at an extra £900. They took the money then later on that night said they were cancelling that as it should have gone through “the travel agent”. A massive amount of hassle going through Expedia, but finally KLM said no they would not let me upgrade. Have asked for a refund for the £900, but still waiting so have done a charge back via my credit card. I can’t do a 12 and a half hour flight on the cramped seats they have due to back issues so have cancelled the whole holiday. KLM will not give me a full refund on the tickets I bought so I’m also around £450 down. Their “customer support” is based in the Philippines so expect responses at midnight then like with me, they just start ignoring you. Avoid KLM like the plague. Holiday if a lifetime up in smoke thanks to their pig headed arrogance.

### “poor communication and customer service”
I fly often for work and personal travel, and every time I fly with KLM, I experience the worst service and treatment. Besides their flights always being delayed, what is even more frustrating is the poor communication and customer service I have always received. The in-flight staff and desk customer service representatives are consistently rude and unhelpful. I recently experienced another instance of horrible treatment, and I strongly recommend that anyone considering flying with KLM reconsider. Instead, pay a bit more for an airline that actually cares about its customers and strives to assist them. To summarize: DO NOT FLY WITH KLM.

### "lost my luggage 4 times"
KLM is a good company and still have some problems. I have to wait for my luggage almost 1 hour on the belt side in Copenhagen, on the last 6 trips by with KLM has lost my luggage 4 times, more than 72 hours.

### “lost our baggage three times”
Not Verified | KLM has lost our baggage three times in a row, causing a lot of stress, wasted time and money. One cannot avoid this even with hand luggage, because they always force people to check it in. The last time i asked at the check in counter to keep my hand luggage with me due to my previous experiences and they told me it was absolutely impossible and that because i have paid less than other people on the plane i am obliged to check in my lugagge. I have also had a flight cancelled twice in one day and got little to no compensation for the trouble. So not so great experiences all in all.

### "I couldn’t fault it"
I was initially booked on a MAN-MUN-BKK flight with Lufthansa, however due to a delay I was rebooked on to KLM. I had two connection and then was flying to Bangkok with another airline. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of KLM. I have heard negative reports on the airline. I couldn’t fault it. On time comfortable seats on both flight I took to Amsterdam and Vienna. I would be more than happy to fly them again.

### “customer service team ignores you”
Not Verified | At the airport they tell you what your rights are after flight cancellation, even hand out A4 sheets. Now, after 6 months still trying to get the compensation I am eligible for. Their customer service team ignores you and never gets back to you. On the day of the cancellation I spent 6! hours on the phone waiting for their "service" personnel to pick up. Ridiculous!

### "Cabin crew friendly"
I flew the new refurbished airplane with 1-2-1 seat map. Plenty of tech - charging USB, type C, wireless. Comfortable seat, full flat with places to deposit small stuff. Boarding well organized. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. Did not eat, used the lounge instead. Drinks were good though. Arrival on time. Good job KLM.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Very friendly cabin crew provide full service from Athens to Amsterdam, with two rounds with sandwiches, beverage service and small cakes. Amsterdam Airport is nice and easy to to change planes.

### "Absolutely appalling experience"
Absolutely appalling experience with KLM. We were advised to check our bags through to Amsterdam at the check-in desk as the flight had been overbooked (we arrived at the desk 2 hours before hour departure time). Only to be told we were on standby for the second flight so might have to wait in Amsterdam for a day. We were then met by another very rude staff member at the gate at Amsterdam who told us our bags had not left Dublin and there was nothing she could do for us. We managed to get in the flight (although seated apart) to Buenos Aires and arrived but no bags. 4 days later our bags arrived to Ushuai with no apology from any KLM staff member during the entire ordeal. On the plus side, we got engaged in Ushuai the same day our bags arrived. Just as well I kept the ring in my hand-luggage! !

### "refused to provide any type of compensation"
On 10th of May my dad (senior citizen) was supposed to get a flight at 6.10AM from Luxembourg to Stockholm with a layover of 1h35 in Amsterdam and arrival in Stockholm at 10.45AM. Due to issues at the Luxembourg aiport, his flight from Luxembourg to Amsterdam was cancelled and he was rebooked on the flight from Luxembourg to Zurich and then to Stockholm. Due to delays in the flight from Luxembourg to Zurich and very short layover time, he missed the correspondence from Zurich to Stockholm. He was then was rebooked on another flight from Zurich to Munich to then take the correspondence for Stockholm from the Munich Airport. I strongly believe that the choice of rebooking him on the flight to Zurich was not an optimal choice, given the short layover time and the delay that caused him to miss the correspondence to Stockholm. I believe KLM staff should have been mindful of the short layover time and potential delay before booking him on the alternative flight from Zurich and changing his route one more time. The initial journey that we had booked and paid for was as follows: LUX -> AMS AMS -> ARN Departure 6:10AM on 10th May from LUX, arrival 10:45 to ARN on 10th of May Total journey duration: 4h 35 min My dad's final journey ended up being as follows: LUX -> AMS (Cancelled) AMS -> ARN (Missed due to previous flight cancelation) LUX -> ZRH (Departed with delay) ZRH -> ARN (Missed due to delay of previous flight) ZRH -> MUC (Rebooked on additional stop due to previous journey not being optimally planned and missed correspondence because of delays) MUC -> ARN Departure 10:45AM on 10th May from LUX, arrrival to ARN 00:11AM on 11th of May Total journey duration: 13h 26 min (excluding the 4h 35 minutes waiting time between 6:10AM LUX -> AMS cancelled flight and LUX-> ZRH flight) My dad was supposed to have only one stop but due to poor planning he ended up having two stops, missing a family event that he had to attend on 10th of May and ended up reaching the destination on the following day. I believe that my dad is entitled to at least some compensation to account for the discomfort that was caused on this day as he ended up spending the whole day going from one airport to the other when he was only planned to have one stop in his journey. However, KLM refused to provide any type of compensation even in the form of a voucher. I am very disappointed by (i) the suboptimal service provided by the staff at the airport who booked my dad on a flight with very short layover, causing me to miss the corresponding flight, (ii) the lack of acknowledgment from customer service team for all the discomfort that was caused to my dad on that day.

### "need to check in your carry"
I don’t recommend flying KLM because of the poor customer service they have. It is my second time when they treat you with disrespect and you need to check in your carry on taking a 10 hour flight and after connecting for your last destination. I prefer pay to pay a little extra and have a great quality service than going to this miserable situations with them. You pay them and they treat you like you owe them something because of the rules of the company, but they forget who the customer is. Something must have changed because they were not like this before. I don’t recommend it anymore.

### "baggage was damage beyond repair"
My baggage was damage beyond repair during the first leg of my transatlantic flight. I purchased a replacement and on arrival in Toronto the baggage was ripped at the back (a cut of about 5 inches) and one wheel totally broken, rendering my “new” case garbage. I have written to KLM customer care more than a dozen times - apart from asking me to email a void cheque (so now they have my bank details) their replies have been dismissive, 8 weeks later I have not received compensation for either piece of baggage and KLM are not responding to my communications. Disgraceful. I have no complaint about on board comfort or cabin crew, but my overall experience with KLM has been a huge disappointment. I would not deliberately choose this airline (or Air France) again due to their lack of customer care.

### "been denied compensation"
Not Verified |   KLM lost 2 of our luggage on August 11, 2023, during a flight from Amsterdam to Washington DC; each luggage weighing more than 44 pounds. Despite weeks of communication and providing every required evidence and information, we have been denied compensation or any help to find them. We were compensated less than 20 percent ($639) for one of the luggage and no compensation for the second lost luggage. This is very unprofessional behavior and humiliation to the customers. The most ridiculous part is that their first question is asking for the original copy of the receipt for each item they lost. I don't know how many people in the world will keep receipts of every item they have purchased during their lifetime.

### "Disappointing service"
Disappointing service. Questionable food/snacks on board. Horrible earphones, so bad that one can’t hear the audio at all (and I flew multiple aircraft - the same story with all of them). I am platinum for life and yet I was denied access to the lounge in Amsterdam because of my flights schedule. If you ever could chose different airline instead, that is my recommendation.

### "you may not get your money back"
I booked with KLM a flight to from Dammam to Buenos Aires as it was a shortest one available with only once stop on the way. 24 hrs one way or so. Later KLM cancelled the flights and even didn’t let me know – I only learned this occasionally as checked the reservation online. Immediately I asked for refund of 12,600 Saudi Riyals that I paid. KLM processed half of the refund reasonably quick and I received it in 5 days, the other half was pending for another 4-5 days and then I received an email saying that 35% of it will be credited as a travel voucher. I never requested this travel voucher and want my cash back in a form I paid it. Looks like KLM tries to enforce me spending $ with them again for another trip that I don’t want. I do not recommend anyone dealing with this airline as they steal your money and try to sell their vouchers that I personally do not need and hate this sort of offers. Think twice before paying them anything as you may not get your money back.

### “Very bad service”
Not Verified | Very bad service, bought 2 tickets but our seats are far away from each other. Nobody could help us and this is for an 12 hours long flight. The airline did this on their own not informing us and surprised us on the airport and could not fix anything. KLM = Budget and bad.

### "ever helpful and attentive"
Dublin to KLIA via Amsterdam. Service was great in both short haul flights (Dub- Ams return part) and this review is mainly on the Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur return leg. On the way out the meal was excellent and I especially noted how good the beef rendang dish was. However there was something that shocked me on the KL809 flight. During the breakfast service the stewardess that was serving dropped the tongs used to serve bread rolls on the floor (next to my seat) and nonchalantly picked it up and served the rest of us with this! This unfortunately marred what would have been a perfect trip for me. Is there no basic policy re cleanliness and hygiene or am I missing something here? Other than that blip the rest of the trip was top notch, a special mention for the cabin crew on the return flight KL810. Great service, ever helpful and attentive and no incidents like on the outbound flight. KLM is a great airline and I will definitely be using them again but I hope they can address the issues that I highlighted which to me should be something that no passenger should have to point out. This is just common sense, I wouldn't use something I have dropped on the floor like this on myself never mind serving customers, please take note (hence I couldn't give 5/5 for cabin staff service)

### "an awful experience"
Very unpleasant experience. They had trouble during my check-in. After 1h30 of waiting in front of the counter, they ware able to issue me a new ticket so I had to seat separated from my family. The adventure is not over, they lost two out of our three checked-in luggage, those remained somehow in Amsterdam and we have landed in Washington DC. After additional time lost to check the status of the lost luggage, we have finally got those, delivered around midnight the next day. Staying awake with the jet lag was again not pleasant. We had to spend extra money on buying some clothes our first day of vacation. It was an awful experience. And last thing, do not purchase on-board internet on those old planes, it is a waste of money.

### "Cabin Crews were good"
Riyadh to New York flights were both on-time. Long layover at Amsterdam but didn't matter much since I got access to Aspire Lounge No. 41. Cabin Crews were good. Captain kept us updated especially with the AMS-JFK where there was a light earthquake that hit New York as we approach the city which fortunately didn't disrupt the flights.

### "Premium Economy section was outstanding"
The best long distance flight experience I’ve ever had. The Premium Economy section was outstanding. I’m 6’7” and definitely need the extra legroom and was extremely comfortable on KLM. The seats were wide and nicely padded. The entertainment screens were large and the selection was good. Likewise the food selection was excellent. Most importantly, the flight crew was over-the-top outstanding as we we were initially greeted by name, and served flawlessly throughout the flight. I will seek out KLM for all future international flights.

### "not want to reimburse anything"
The KLM return flight from Liberia (Costa Rica) to Amsterdam was changed into San Jose to Amsterdam. The reason they gave was: work on the Liberia runway. This was indicated well in advance (4 months). However, I was told that it was okay to accept the proposal and receive a refund for the costs incurred after the holiday. Because I had planned and booked a roundtrip by hire car, I had to change a lot of things, which meant I had extra cost. KLM does not want to reimburse anything now, because they have adhered to the legal rules. However, all other airlines departed from Liberia at normal schedules. I still have not received any answer from KLM about the actual reason for the airport change. It looks like KLM was not telling the truth and was only thinking of their own advantage and not the customers. I would appreciate a more customer-friendly behaviour of KLM.

### "overbooked flight to Helsinki"
Not Verified |   Long flight. Continuation KLM chose in a overbooked flight to Helsinki. KLM choose the last tight chairs for seniors coming with long previous tiring flight from Canada. I saw no possibility to get a proper seat in the plane. Cannot anymore to use a carrier offering this quality service. Changing to some better client caring company.

### "extremely disappointing"
Due to the pandemic, I haven't travelled on KLM for a few years. My memory of the airline was efficient friendly and professional. Unfortunately, on my return trip in February 2024, it was the exact opposite. Both outward bound flights were delayed (I flew via Amsterdam to Accra,) & then my luggage did not arrive in Accra. I immediately reported my missing suitcase at the airport. The missing luggage meant that all my plans for the next day were cancelled , at considerable inconvenience and cost. The next afternoon, KLM emailed that my suitcase would arrive that evening. Back again to the airport, I collected my suitcase. When I arrived back in the UK I filled in the KLM claim compensation form for my missing luggage (a modest amount.) This was denied because the official claimed I 'didn't report my missing luggage when I arrived' This was blatantly untrue. I emailed back explaining that I had reported it. No response. Emailed again. No response. Phoned 2 weeks and spoke to a customer services assistant who told me someone would be in contact. 5 weeks later and still no response. A trip that was nearly ruined and then a very disappointing response to my compensation claim to correct what was KLM's responsibility, has left me with a very negative perception of KLM. Add to that, some off-hand staff yelling at customers to hurry up and board, getting rained on when disembarking from the Schiphol shuttle bus at 6am, my experience has been extremely disappointing.

### "Rip off charges"
Rip off charges like a budget airline. Thought I added three checked bags to our party but had only two. Could have added another online but didn't want to delay people behind us so thought being a Blue member would just do it at the desk. £47.15 one way instead of £19.30 both ways. Will never use again.

### "not refunded me for my tickets"
Booked flight with KLM for my kids birthdays. They lost my flight tickets couple week before flying, then found them again after I emailed them bank statements to prove I've paid them and they ain't refunded me, so they sent me more tickets. Went to check in online the day of flying it would not let me so I called them they said everything is fine just do it at the airport. Get to the airport they have cancelled my tickets again phoned them they could not find my tickets even the airport staff spoke to them and felt bad they could not put us on a flight. 10 minutes after check-in they found my tickets which now is too late to board, they would not put us on a next flight said we will have pay ourselves knowing it's double the price. Over a month's later after phoning numerous times getting passed from pillow to post these people have still not refunded me for my tickets.

### "refuses to refund extra costs"
Not Verified |  Booked on premium comfort class, but seats not available on flight. KLM refuses to refund extra costs (around 600 euros) paid for the seats in this class.

### "seat and tray were both broken"
Not Verified | I paid close to $90 for a 'comfort' seat for my flight. My seat and tray were both broken. I could not lean back into my seat as it would not stay upright. The tray would not lay flat so I had to use my knees to hold the tray up to prevent food and drink from sliding onto me. I let the attendants know and I was told ' that is too bad they are broken'. I sent KLM a request for my money to be refunded and denied it.

### "free drinks and small snack"
Had to buy last minute ticket on KLM to return home because of strike with the originally booked airline. An incredibly nice and efficient crew, free drinks and small snack. These two early morning hops made my day and let me feel appreciated as a customer.

### "Horrendous customer service"
This may seem a long time since our flight last July 2023, but it has taken so long to ‘try’ to make a claim. Horrendous customer service and no concern at all about what happened to us. We were on a mission trip to Uganda in July. We originally flew from Dublin stayed overnight then took a flight from Amsterdam to Entebbe the next day, 10th July 2023. We were to stop in Kigali for fuel and picking up passengers. We were put off the flight literally told to get off the plane with no instructions as to what what was happening only that there was engine failure. We waited 2 hrs for 4 cases to come through, waited another hour on a bus to take us to an hotel. I was running around the passengers asking them for their boarding passes so the staff could gather them to make sure everyone got to an hotel. We went to Four Points Hotel in Kigali where we received the most beautiful meal albeit by now it was 1am. The next morning I got an email offering a flight from Amsterdam to Entebbe? They meant for us to travel back to Amsterdam ourselves at our own expense and do the same route we had just done. Obviously I refused. They then offered us a flight on Thursday 13th July, bearing in mind we were meant to arrive in Entebbe on 10th July. We then discovered there was a KLM office in the Marriot Hotel across the road so off I went. The girl there was amazing, the only time through the whole process we felt someone was on our side. She offered us a flight that afternoon (Tuesday 11th) with Ethiopian Airlines. She forgot to add on all our luggage which was 4 suitcases, remember we were on a mission trip, so they were full of toys, sweets, clothes etc, hence when we got to the airport in Kigali, we had to pay Ethiopian Airlines £353 for two cases. We had to fly to Addis Ababa then eventually onto Entebbe. We were by this stage delayed between 25-26 hours. I have claimed twice with KLM and my latest claim was rejected with the answer “ As per your correspondence, having checked our records, I note that you made voluntary changes before your scheduled flight and were also charged for voluntary changes per fare conditions, furthermore I note you have been charged for two bags by Ethiopian Airlines , therefore I ask you to contact Ethiopian Airlines for this charge”. WE NEVER MADE OUR OWN ARRANGEMENTS! And the only reason we had to pay for extra cases is because the KLM representative didn’t book all our luggage onto our flight. I have rang KLM again and been told I have to raise a new claim, I cannot contact another higher authority as it is an international flight. Where do I go from here? Who cares? It seems KLM certainly do not. I am stressed, distraught and very upset at the way we have been treated. Do not fly with this airline if you have any choice. I have told all my friends and as I intend to travel again on mission trips I certainly will not be going with KLM.

### "downgraded my seat"
KLM is the worst airline I have ever used in my life, you cannot trust them. They downgraded my seat with no explanation and no compensation, just heartless instructions to change seat at last minute.

### "Seat was comfortable"
Seat was comfortable plenty of room lots of storage and wireless charging. Cabin crew were friendly. Food onboard was plentiful.

### "unable to make the 2nd leg of the trip"
Lagos to Paris with Air France booked through KLM. I have had the worst experience speaking to KLM customer service staff that seem to be incompetent and lack knowledge of what they are doing. I spent over $10,000 on my family ticket to Canada. When we were unable to make the 2nd leg of the trip, I asked for a refund. It has been series of mail back and forth asking for one thing or the other. However, sometime in December 2023, I received 2 separate mail requesting for my bank details so the refund can be processed. I sent all information request and yet no word from KLM. Only for me to get this generic mail today saying “We are sorry to inform you that we could not accept your refund request, as either the reason for refund does not meet the criteria or the document submitted is non-refundable.

### "crew was great and very helpful"
The first leg of this trip was in a 737 with the usual awful European standard Business Class. That is an economy seat with the middle of three left vacant. A boxed meal was provided and two drinks on this 1-hour journey. The main flight was on a 787-10. On both legs, the crew was great and very helpful and the Jamco “Venture” business class seats are arranged in a 1-2-1 reverse herringbone layout. Roomy with good privacy, and direct aisle access. In bed mode, they are roomy as you can lower the armrest on the aisle side. The blanket is a bit thin, to be honest and the one pillow is too soft and pretty small. The food on board on our return flight took me by surprise. Airlines have a big problem as far as catering is concerned. The first is that at altitude, our taste buds change and almost everything is bland. The second is that airline meals are prepared in huge factories and reheated in the galley before service. Often the result is either hard and overdone or overdone and mushy. I was therefore amazed to be given my breakfast choice of Shakshuka with a poached egg and find the white perfectly set and first-class runny yolk! Wow! That egg had been cooked, speed chilled, packed into a trolley, stored for over seven hours, and reheated before service. On long haul, KLM offers passengers in business a Delpht Pottery house filled with Dutch Gin. There are over a hundred of these to choose from and each cottage is numbered. Very collectible. All the houses are based on real buildings in the Netherlands.

### "Never any honest smile"
Flew Amsterdam to Bangkok 5th Feb. 2024 as a partial result of a rerouting by Kenya Airways. Ticket issued by KLM and paid by Kenya Airways. Came from Nairobi by Kenya Airways. Transfer in Amsterdam was in a narrow timeslot, but bearable and fairly fast: no immigration checks transiting as both destinations are non-Schengen. Only security consumed time. Boarding effective. Huge, spacious, B777-300, fully loaded with passengers. Lounge 52 in non-Schengen terminal is spacious and good as always. Noisy aircraft. Got an acceptable seat. On time. The issue with KLM is the poor onboard catering and drink service. And, the surly, patronising, despotic, and arrogant staff. Passengers are de facto humiliated and treated like pigs in a pigstall. Nothing is allowed, seatbelts always on as to minimise their work. Nothing extra given or special provided for anybody. There is no recognition of frequent flyer status, even elite passengers. KLM need to up their game and renew the ageing stewardesses, though it seems too late. Hardly any drink rounds and always disallowed to order two drinks while finally being addressed. On a 10 hours flight we were offered meals only 2 times. First drink round was after 3 hours since take-off, way after the first meal service elapsed. Food of low quality and without any true options. Breakfast inedible. IFE OK, WiFi must be paid for; internet works with some hiccups, though. Call bells not answered and even if so, you are getting a rude, cold attitude slammed in your face so you regret to have called them, as anything appears to be too much of a trouble. The crew despise their clients and elite fliers are not getting any premium. The staff appear consistently to be Dutch and and respect for passengers is far, far away. Never any honest smile, no charm, no joy, no jokes to break the ice. KLM has a long way to go compared with its colleagues on Kenya Airways and Air France.

### “excellent from start till finish”
What to say, just excellent from start till finish. We enjoyed every minute, not a single complaint. Staff welcoming always courteous and listening. Seats comfortable, menu well balanced + choice between 3 different dishes, aperitif, wine and digestif. Ice cream, sweet or salty bits during the flight, drinks. Entertainement system modern, large selection of programs & movies. Wifi was available but we did not try it. Thank you KLM, we'll be back.

### “uncooperative, incompetent and rude agent”
Delayed more than 3 hours on a long distance flight (over 3500km). The flight attendants who spoke the local language did not even on one occasion say sorry from the beginning till the end of the flight. Applied for a compensation. Now I’m arguing with a very uncooperative, incompetent and rude agent from their customer service who tries to reduce my compensation by 50%. I am still requesting to quote the legal basis for the reduction. His reaction: “I’m going to give you a 50% compensation, so give me your bank account info. Until then I’ll keep sending you an automatic reminder”. After all this experience I am seriously considering not using Air France - KLM ever again.

### “should be prohibited from separating families”
I realised in December 2023 that KLM uses an algorithm that deliberately separates families in seating arrangements in order to charge them at least 50 euros each to sit together. This practice of separating families (even with same surnames) in order to extort money from them is immoral and should be contrary to regulations for the airline industry. We faced this on the trip from Brussels to Port of Spain (POS) and from POS to Amsterdam (AMS). And to my amazement, KLM even charges 50 euros for people to sit next to each other EVEN in row 41 next to the stinky toilets. I have heard about airlines looking for new revenue streams but this is ridiculous. Furthermore, these were tickets that each cost 800 euros more than they did 2 years previously for the same trip, even though they were bought as early as August! Another issue is KLM has no information on the ingredients in the meals that they serve on board. I asked for this and flight attendants did not know; and when I asked them to check with the information supplied by the caterer they said that there was no such information on the flight. When I tackled the Purser about this, he claimed that they have information on all their meals on a database but after several minutes of searching that database, he was embarrassed and had to admit he could not tell me what was in the meal I had which was simply labelled vegetarian. I find this unacceptable because European law is very strict about labelling regulations concerning the ingredients in food sold anywhere in Europe. So, how come European airlines break the law when they are in the air? I found the same thing with Lufthansa on flights from Brussels to Nairobi and return last week. KLM also claims on its site that one can take a carry-on and another small bag (handbag, computer bag, etc.) on board; but it then sends emails to travellers saying that the cabin may be full and you should check your handbag. A very rude Swissport woman insisted that we check in our carry-ons in Brussels but I refused. She then insisted that I check at least 1 bag and made a rude comment in Dutch about me in a sarcastic tone. I would appreciate comments and feedback on these observations, particularly the first. I fundamentally believe that airlines should be prohibited from separating families when a booking is made by 1 person and then charging them extortionate fees to allow families to sit together. And ALL airlines MUST have information about the ingredients in all the meals they serve on all flights. This can be simply done by requesting that caterers provide this with all meals supplied. British Airways has this information on all flights I usually fly. So, I cannot see why other airlines do not have this.

### "we have rejected your refund request"
Booked premier economy, twice upgraded to business, as the first attempt kept me in the same premier economy seat according to the system. Both times I did receive receive a confirmation I booked business. Arrived at the airport and was told that due to a change of plane I was downgraded from Premier Economy to Economy. Clearly, none of the two paid upgrades was registered in their systems. Money taken though, once through credit card, once through a Dutch bank. So what was supposed to be a relaxed business class flight ended in 12+ hours economy. On the 31st of December. Staff at airport very friendly and understanding, but this was a ‘software glitch’ and nothing they could do as plane fully booked. Ok, software issue, happens. Staff in the plane professional and friendly as well. I received an email from KLM I would get refunded 75% of the value of the ticket coupon in Premium Comfort Class due to the downgrade. I received another email stating I would receive the fare difference between economy and premier economy. So thats not the same. I requested through their website a refund of the double paid business class upgrade. It was rejected ‘we have rejected your refund request, as your document has been fully used, according to our systems.  Yes, in economy although paid twice for business. So far still no refund, not for the upgrade to business class, not for the downgrade from premier to economy. The staff on the airport and in the plane is great, it’s the systems and online customer service that doesn’t seem to function well. Thanks for a lousy start of the year. Be careful booking upgrades, seems their systems can’t handle it.

### “told they don't give credits”
Not Verified | After calling to confirm I could take my dog on a flight. I booked the flight 2 weeks later online. Then to register my dog for the flight I was then told the flight doesn't take dogs. Business class ticket totally unusable now. Asked for credit, was told they don't give credits since covid. Then asked for refund or to be able to transfer to family member told not possible. I'm now out 1700$ for a mistake made by a klm agent with no recourse other than to sue in small claims. Will never ever book or use klm again.

### “Service by FA's was impeccable”
Not Verified | Ground experience was good. Although the "Sky Priority" security check was not yet opened BC our flight was very early in the morning. The Lounge was the most inviting and unique in its environment. GREAT Business class layout. Although not an ‘enclosed' space but the layout keeps your space very much hidden from others in vicinity. Service by FA's was impeccable. Food quality excellent and frequency of meals was very adequate. Perhaps the most outstanding feature was the tableware such as plates, silverware, cups, etc. They were the most unique part of the meal and food presentation. IMO it's the business class offering in the European Flag carriers.

### "flight attendants were very kind"
This review will be a little long because there is a story to tell to get the full experience. I went to italy after finally settling my divorce after 2 years. I went to be with a friend who after 4 of the 7 days ditched me. Mind you she was my translator and lived in italy and my guide around the city. So when she left on day 4 I was left to figure things out on my own. Mean less to say things only got worse. I tripped and fell on day 5, smashed my glasses into my eye cut my face up around my eye bled really bad and walked 2.5 km back to apartment with no help. Few days later i get on this flight back home.. i was so ready to go home, bruised and battered literally by life and my vacation and was expecting nothing but the worse of a flight back home. To my surprise i got on flight DL9418 on January 18th @ 06:30 am local time and it was very pleasant. The plane was nicer than the one i arrived in. I sat in my seat and it was very spacious and the pilot got us in the air quickly. Then here is where i think KLM stepped up from other flights i have been on. Including over delta. The two flight attendants were very kind. Most people avoided me with a cut up eye and bruised eye. I am 6'3 and about 280 lbs. So i am sure i am little intimidating and with a cut and bruised eye i understand. But these ladies were very concerned about my well being and if i had a good trip. Keep in mind i am not anything special. I am below average guy so it was genuine concern and care these ladies had. The brunette was very sweet and came back with a special meal and said i brought this for you. Also made sure i had drinks throughout the flight and wanted to make sure at least one thing went well on my trip. And i must say, she succeeded. Even as i left she wished me well as i left. In a week of failures, i at least felt good for few hours in the one day and i would suggest to anyone flying from BLQ to AMS to try to give KLM a try as the service I had that day was exceptional. If they provide this service across the board, they will continue to have great success and I will be glad to tell me story to others. For the money i spent that week and the bad week i had, the 2 hour flight made everything seem not as bad as it once was. Thank you KLM and thank you to the two flight attendants that day.

### “my last time taking KLM”
Not Verified | KLM is one of the worst experiences I have ever had. 1) Staff very unfriendly, I was running a lot to catch a flight at a change over and got it at the last minute. When I got onboard I asked for some water as I am getting a cough, but the flight attendant simply said, they cant provide any service until the flight takes off. I was surprised to hear that and told them my situation, he refused again, I had to get out of my seat to ask another attendant and he gave me the water. 2) Very old planes: all flights are very old and no new technology. Old seats, old screen. I felt like I was sitting on rock on these seats and was very uncomfortable. All old movies and they don't even work, if it stuck while playing you can’t do anything. 3) Bad food: there is no second option for food. You have to eat what they give you. No selection. 4) Seat reclining: Even after you complete your meals and everyone is ready to sleep, I had to request the passenger sitting behind me to check if he is okay to recline my seat. He simply refused and said he was watching a movie. I called the flight attendant again to let him know, again, he simply said I have to resolve that with the other passenger and he cant do anything. This is my last time taking KLM, don't use this airline unless you get a real good deal, pay few more dollars and take any other flight but not KLM.

### “Do not let KLM be your choice”
Not Verified | This is a terrible airline. They first changed my husband’s seat. He was part of a party of 5. Then they rebooked me on a different flight, costing me thousands of dollars to change my domestic flights. I lost my shift as a doc and my daughter as an ultrasonographer. Lied about a flight that was cancelled-it was not-and then expected me to cancel check in to rebook me, after cancelling my booking reference. I will never fly with them again and they were the only overseas airline I have ever flown. They just do not care. Wanted to give me a voucher-I never will fly with them again. It is not worth it. There are lots of airlines to choose from. Do not let KLM be your choice.

### "cabin crew were very friendly"
We flew from Amsterdam to Curaçao and back with 2 adults and 2 children of the age of 11 and 12. Everything went smooth. The KLM app works really great. The food was nice. The cabin crew were very friendly. Only good things about the flying itself. This was my third flight with KLM. Before I flew twice to Bangkok. Same experience. This year I'll fly to Seoul but unfortunately not with KLM. The KLM tickets are ridiculous expensive. €1700 for one person without big luggage. KLM seems to be the only one. All the other companies have the luggage included. Now I'll fly with Qatar Airways for half of the price with suitcase! €850. If the price was good I'll always fly with KLM but otherwise I'll fly with other companies.

### “crew were so kind and attentive”
Not Verified | Definitely one of the best Airlines in Europe. All flights were on time and their crew some of the best out there. Upgraded very cheap LIM-AMS which was the best decision for a Long over night flight, crew were so kind and attentive and was more hosts than crew. KLM is my number one airline choice short and Long haul.

### “A frustrating experience”
Zeer teleurstellend contact met KLM tijdens een noodsituatie. Hun beloofde kernwaarden van klantgerichtheid en betrouwbaarheid waren ver te zoeken. Wachttijden aan de telefoon waren steevast langer dan een uur, en de klantenservice reageerde traag en ineffectief via de app. Beloften over een voucher bleven onvervuld. Een frustrerende ervaring die haaks staat op wat je van een vooraanstaande luchtvaartmaatschappij verwacht. - Very disappointing contact with KLM during an emergency. Their promised core values ​​of customer focus and reliability were hard to find. Wait times on the phone were consistently longer than an hour, and customer service was slow and ineffective to respond via the app. Promises about a voucher remained unfulfilled. A frustrating experience that is at odds with what you expect from a leading airline.

### "no refund of seats were given"
We paid for specific seats months in advance and they changed their plane and no refund of seats were given. Customer care was robotic, and they gave a 50 CAD voucher for compensation, which kinda felt humiliating, tbh. Booked on Delta, operated by KLM. KLM continues to be on a cheaper side, but don’t pay for seats in advance, they don’t honour it, instead just wait for check in window and try your luck

### "the worst stressful experience"
Its over 20 years that I travel with KLM & it has always been my favorite flight, best service & never nothing to complaint. My recent KLM flight to travel Brussel-Nairibi & Back though was different. 2 days before the return flight, I received a notification that my flight is cancelled & I got a replacement flight with Emirates. I had paid extra for extra luggage & suitable seat due to my Shoulder pain, while the flight of Emirates I was given, had different luggage policy, the flight was much longer, the stop in Dubai was around 5 hours & the seat they gave me was not comfortable. Plus the fact that I was forced to pay 240EUR in Nairobi due to luggage policy difference from KLM to Emirates, and I had a horrible stressful checkiin as the airport checkin desk was totally confused with my ticket, and I arrived 5 hours later than normally scheduled by my original flight in Brussels. I lost a very important appointment in Brussel, plus after arrival, luggages of 30 persons were lost & we had to wait in Brussel's airport for an hour to find our luggages. I claimed all these, where I arrived with so much delay, the stressful situation that caused me health condition, losing an important meeting & having being forced ot pay extra 240EUR for my luggaes as KLM accepts 12Kilo hand luggage but Emirates only 7 kilo. After all these inconveniences, after 1.5 months, I only received 300EUR from KLM, they did not even compensate me for the 240EUR extra I had to pay for my luggages. This is unacceptable that customers pay extra for suitable seats, pay extra for luggages then my flight is changed to another agency, I loose my luggage option, my special seats that I had paid extra. If a flight of KLM is cancelled, I should get a new KLM flight. If I wanted to travel with Emirates, I would have had purchased Emirates in the first place. This is unacceptable that KLM cancells my flight & replace it with Emirates. I had arranged this travel to relax after having had difficult timing in my life & my beautiful travel eanded with the worst stressful experience ever plus all the extra expenses that I was not reimbursed by KLM.

### "Terrible seats. Very narrow"
Terrible seats. Very narrow and not able to sleep in them. Amenities are non existent. Food quality is ok-ish. Service provided by the crew is minimal. Not worth it especially for the price you pay.

### "our flight was fantastic"
Not Verified |  We should have flown out of Edinburgh on the 21st December 23 for a 7 day holiday in Las Vegas via Amsterdam unfortunately the evening of the 20th our flights had been cancelled. We contacted KLM customer service and spoke with an agent who managed to book us on a flight but with a different airline. I must thank KLM customer service team for all the help that made the start to our holiday brilliant service. After our holiday came to an end we had the great pleasure of flying home on a KLM flight, ( first time flying KLM ) crew fantastic my wife can’t eat cheese and they found her a meal that had none and they certainly didn’t forget as every meal my wife had didn’t have cheese amazing service. I only had one complaint my pasta dish was over cooked, pasta very mushy. Apart from that our flight was fantastic. Once landed in Amsterdam the staff at the airport couldn’t be more friendly and helpful and again our flight back to Edinburgh was brilliant KLM must have the most friendly and helpful staff and crew. I would definitely fly KLM looking forward to my next holiday.keep up the fantastic work KLM I’ve since joined KLM Flying Blue club.

### "No more flights with KLM for me"
I travelled to Dusseldorf from Bristol via Amsterdam to visit my old friends and celebrate Xmas with them. It was 1 week trip. On arrival to Dusseldorf my checked in bag was missing which was immediately reported at the airport. I was told I will be reunited with my bag in 1-2 days. In fact, however, I managed to get my bag only after a week at the airport just a couple of hours before my return flight. In addition to KLM completely ruined my holiday by not delivering my bag with all Xmas presents for my friends, I had a very unpleasant surprise when I finally got my bag. The padlock was missing. When I opened the bag, all contents was in complete mess. Everything, which I neatly arranged, was removed by someone and then carelessly thrown back. All Christmas presents, which I carefully wrapped, were torn opened. The lens cap of my expensive camera was removed and the glass was against hard part of a tripod, which was itself damaged. The KLM customer services for delayed baggage was absolutely unhelpful. I called them every now and then but they had no idea where my bag was and when I was going to get it. It was my second flight with KLM and the first time in my life I had a problem with baggage. No more flights with KLM for me any time soon.

### “What a disappointment from KLM!”
My three children are traveling with KLM today. As soon as it was possible (30 hours in advance), I checked them all in together. However, now they are seated separately on the plane: one on seat 18b, another on 30e, and the last one in row 32. KLM did not provide an option to choose different seats, and it seems as if this was done intentionally. The only way to sit together is to pay an additional 54 euros on top of the already expensive tickets. What a disappointment from KLM!

### "my ticket got cancelled again"
Not Verified |  The airline first cancelled my ticket on no ground and claimed that it is an error. Then, few days later, talked to their CS, my ticket was effective again. After a few days more, funny thing happened again that my ticket got cancelled again with no reason given. How messed up is the system in KLM that they can cancel and recover and cancel anyway they want. This airline is just like a gigantic circus. No alternative solutions was given and my flight was flying very soon. The company left me in a terrible and difficult situation which is unacceptable. This is how KLM treat their customers who pay them.

### "Friendly crew on the A330"
Still the best option between the Netherlands and the former Dutch Caribbean. Easy check in online and plenty of self service stands to drop off your luggage at Schiphol, which makes travelling so much easier. Friendly crew on the A330, which is much more comfortable than the 777 or 787 because of the 2-4-2 seating. Plenty of tasty food and drinks on the 9 hr trip to St. Maarten. Arriving at St. Maarten was a disaster since they are reconstructing the airport. Took us 90 mins to exit, but not KLM's fault. Inbound from Curaçao was on a 777, which has the horrible 3-4-3 configuration. We managed to get the only row of 2 in economy however at the very last row. Again attentive crew, with a tasty special meal. Crew served my meal first, together with the normal meal for my wife, ahead of the other passengers, 'so we could eat together'. How nice! Plane left an hour late but arrived only 10 mins after scheduled time because of the usual jetstream above the Atlantic.

### "cancelled and rebooked to Air France"
Paris-Amsterdam-Copenhagen 7 Dec. 2023. Used the nice Air France Salon lounge in terminal 2F. Flight became delayed and further delayed due to “traffic constraints” in AMS. Eventually I cancelled and rebooked to Air France on a direct flight to CPH, avoiding serious delays, overall. However, the luggage did not make it as they failed to retrieve and retag it from the original flight. Got the luggage delivered to home address 2 days later, and was currently well informed on progress and its whereabouts. Not too bad after all. Separate flight review submitted just now under Air France in Skytrax. That Air France flight was faultless apart from the baggage error/delay.

### "further compensation will be granted"
Not Verified |  I flew with KLM from Nice to Manchester with a 1 hour layover in Amsterdam on November 22nd 2023. The flight from Nice had a 15 minute delay. When I arrived in Manchester I was informed my luggage had been lost and they would try and find it and deliver it to me. Since they could not provide a turnaround time for when this would happen or guarantee it would be delivered to me in time for the events I was attending in Manchester, KLM Support Representatives directed me to purchase replacement clothing and submit a reimbursement claim at the end of my trip. I called from the airport, I called once I arrived to the hotel, and once more before purchasing any item of clothing. All three times I was guaranteed my purchase would be refunded and all three times they could not say when my suitcase would be returned to me. I submitted a claim for the reimbursement on the evening of November 22nd and received an initial response on November 29th asking for my identification as the amount to be refunded exceeded 1000€ (Euro). On December 1st I received another email from KLM Support stating since my luggage had been returned to me on the same day, they will not compensate for my clothing expenses in spite of all the guarantees previously made. I attempted contacting KLM for a reevaluation of my case but they have insisted my case is now closed and no further compensation will be granted.

### "canceled due to snowfall"
Not Verified |  Very bad! We were supposed to get a direct flight home, the evening before we received an email that it had been canceled due to snowfall and we were led to Amsterdam via Frankfurt. We called because we wanted a direct flight, but it turned out that this had never been implemented and we still had to go via Frankfurt. An hour before departure we check the email, the flight is canceled again and this time we are sent via Vienna. It already takes me a day off work and there is hardly any snow in Amsterdam. Erg slecht! Wij zouden een rechtstreekse vlucht naar huis krijgen, de avond van tevoren krijgen we een mail dat deze is geannuleerd vanwege sneeuwval  en worden via Frankfurt naar Amsterdam geleid. Gebeld omdat we een rechtstreekse vlucht wilde, bleek deze nooit te zijn doorgevoerd en wij alsnog via Frankfurt moeten. Een uur voor vertrek kijken wij de mail na, wordt de vlucht weer geannuleerd en dit keer worden wij via Wenen gestuurd. Het kost mij nu al een dag van mijn werk en er ligt amper sneeuw in Amsterdam

### “Cabin crew very friendly”
Boarding in Lisbon was fast, but we had to wait on the air-bridge until the aircraft was cleaned. Cabin crew very friendly, catering was ok, drinks were tasteful. Seats reclinable, new. USB ports for charging devices was available and on-board wi-fi for messaging was free. Wi-fi for internet navigation was charged 8 Euros.Arrival in Amsterdam ahead of schedule.

### "the food was horrible"
They overbooked the flight which meant I got a blank boarding pass and I almost couldn't get on my flight if it weren't for the last minute seat. Also, Infotainment screen looks like its from the 90s and the food was horrible. This is not supposed to be a budget airline but it acts like one.

### "Not worth flying business"
Flight was delayed about 40 minutes, boarding was according to the priorities. Seats were as in economy class, the middle seat was empty, serving as a kind of table. Awful. No entertainment. Food was bad, selection of drinks was ok-ish. Not worth flying business with them in Europe.

### “KLM agents were extremely rude”
KLM agents were extremely rude. KLM operated the first leg of the flight, but the 2nd leg was Delta. Despite being on a Delta flight in the correct seat (confirmed by Delta flight attendant, Delta customer service, Delta boarding pass, and emailed itinerary) the KLM agent came onto the Delta plane and berated me and threatened me to get out of my assigned seat. This created a big humiliating spectacle! I paid for the seat that Delta assigned me and confirmed and the KLM gate agent had no right to treat me the way she did or to remove me from my seat.

### "most AMAZING cabin crew"
I was seated on seat 1A and the cabin crew that attended to me was the most AMAZING cabin crew I’ve ever met since I started flying KLM years ago! So warm and welcoming to the extent that I had to ask her for her name cause I needed to write a review. Often times other cabin crews are hostile but this lady was overly polite! I needed to review her and I hope we get many more crew members like her.

### "Cabin crew as friendly and helpful"
Boarding was fast, the flight departed on-time. Cabin crew was friendly and helpful. Seats in business class are standard economy seats with middle seat free - this is a shame for an airline that wants to be high-class. Food was ok-ish but not great. Good selection of drinks.

### "offered middle seats away from each other"
Not Verified |  KLM is a disaster! Had purchased tickets for flight from PHX to BLR back in July 2023. Initially the itinerary included following flight route: PHX-SLC-AMS-BLR. We selected seats for each flight leg and paid for it. Then after several weeks,  they sent me an email informing that flight route has been changed to: PHX-SLC-CDG (operated by Delta)-BLR. When we reminded them, what about seat selection already made, we’re assured that seat selection would carry forward to new itinerary. And here where KLMs inept, lackadaisical ticketing staff service or lack thereof begins. They only carried forward the CDG-BLR seat selection and forget all about PHX-SLC and SLC-CDG legs. They also messed my itinerary indicating that my flight starts from SLC and not PHX? Contacted Delta who worked hard to fix the messed-up itinerary. However, advised me to contact KLM and advise them to contact Delta regarding re-routing my itinerary as seats on both PHX-SLC and SLC-CDG have been sold-out? Imagine no seat was allocated on SLC-CDG leg and on PHX-SLC leg we 71 year old husband and wife were offered middle seats away from each other? Now on contacting KLM customer service (several agents at different times) they blamed it was us who made a change in itinerary and not them hence KLM is not responsible for re-routing and even an Agent (Neva) advised that I pay additional amounts for re-routing. Several agents even kept me on hold for over 2 hours and later hung up on me, and some ended the call with promise to call back that did not happen. Delta Ticket and Airport crew helped us enormously enabling us to travel entire route in relative comfort? After having flown from USA to India by Emirates, Qatar and Etihad for over 30 years we thought we switch to European airlines like KLM/Air France. What a bad/disastrous decision we made! KLM agents treat you like garbage.

### "Truly appalling airline"
Truly appalling airline. Sadly fly with them several times per month as only option on many routes. Even as gold member, the benefits are pretty useless - their boarding is a joke and their lounge is an awful place to spend time (non Schengen lounge is very good however). They are consistently late. I mean. Nearly all time and, as a frequent flyer with them, I can 100% stand by this. I've even started keeping record - you get the bog-standard automated reply from them of pure waffle "we care about our customers" bla-bla-bla. No they don't. They discriminate against anyone with food allergies on intra European flights. Cheese sandwich is all they offer. No gluten free or dairy free option. No option to pre book special meal either - only on long haul. This Marseilles back to Amsterdam leg was dreadful. They cancelled the evening flight back on the Sunday. Then rebooked to 6:30am flight which was then delayed by over 7 hours. Missed while full day of a wedding because of it. If it was now and then, you'd nearly forgive them but it happens so frequently. Far too frequently. Am in the lounge now waiting for flight to Barcelona, one week later, and guess what - delayed by at least an hour. The only thing going for them is that their staff are usually excellent and friendly.

### "KLM systems and procedures suck"
Have a lung disease, asked oxygen kit for transatlantic flights. Was confirmed. They wouldn't accept payment. They said when check in opens, I can pay thru web. Did not work. System was not allowing me to check in. Sorry, check in at a desk" . Meaning I could not ask for seat upgrade (the kit needs extra leg space). Called them and they said pay at the first flight in the airport desk during checkin. Arrived in ATH, they couldn't accept payment for oxygen, called AMS, they said they will settle this in AMS. Odyssey continues, in AMS they don't know how to charge me. They said come back tomorrow early morning. Next morning after an hour of tries they found the way. I have paid for both flights. Went again to hotel and pick up the family. Return flight again system does not allow check in. In PTY the arrogant and rude KLM man told me they had changed the plane and I cannot upgrade and I have to pay for the oxygen as it seems not paid in the screen. Opened the suitcase and thankfully the receipt was there. KLM systems and procedures suck. Planes are excellent. Food is excellent. Cabin crew is excellent.

### "KLM refused to do the right thing"
Not Verified |  KLM guaranteed our Priority bags would be on our newly booked flight after delays caused us to miss our connecting flight from Amsterdam to Oslo on July 19th, 2023. We were headed to Longyearbyen to board a boat on July 20th. Our Priority bags never made it. As a result when we finally made it to Longyearbyen where we had to spend nearly $2000 USD to replace much of our baggage for our trip above the Arctic Circle. Upon our return from the trip we filed a baggage claim with KLM in an effort to recover some of the cost. At the point of submitting the claim we were told to expect delays in processing due to a large volume of claims. Eventually we were contacted by KLM and given notice that because our claim was not submitted within 21 days after the incident they refused to address the claim. We were 4 days late and had no idea of this requirement. KLM refused to do the right thing and I surmise that because we are not million mile travelers with KLM they had nothing to lose by rejecting the claim. Suffice to say we will avoid KLM in the future.

### "treat the customer like garbage"
Not Verified |  Our flight was diverted from our original airport. KLM made no contact with us to tell us what was going to happen. They just left us hanging at 3am. They were provided three telephone numbers and three emails to contact us and KLM never made contact. I tried to call KLM but the phones went too fast busy. Because of them my family missed two days of my tour and had to purchase new flights on an alternate airline to get to my destination. When I finished my tour I stopped at KLM at Johannesburg airport and talked to the manager that made the decisions on the night we were diverted. He said the reason the phones were not answered was because there were hundreds of passengers and only 5 KLM staff so they took the phone off the hook. He promised KLM would make it right and I was to file for compensation. This is the response I received from KLM - However, your full itinerary started and ended in countries that are outside the European Union. The European Court of Justice has ruled that the legal compensation set by the EC Regulation 261/2004 does not apply to such an itinerary. Therefore, I cannot respond favorably to your request. - So they did not do as the manager promised and they decided rather then make things right they will just treat the customer like garbage.

### "declined to compensate me"
Terrible experience. I have travelled extensively and with many airlines and KLM is by far the worst. My trip back to LA started with a cancelled flight for which none of the passengers were even offered any accommodation or even a food voucher. It has been 3 months since my trip and after extensive calls/emails they still declined to compensate me for the accommodation, food, and transport expenses due to the cancelled flight. I would have been fine with that as things do happen and I like to think of myself as an understanding person, however, upon arriving to LAX, I found out they lost my luggage. Whatever, I thought, it happens, it will arrive and I'll just pick it up. Thankfully I also had an AirTag inside so I saw where it was at all times. Well it was in Amsterdam for 3 months. I have probably called them more than 30 times to check on the status and racked up a bill of over $100 for this, they were extremely unhelpful and spilling empty words to reassure me. Finally, after 3 months, I decided to fly out to Amsterdam (paying out of my own pocket) and pick up the luggage myself since they obviously were not doing anything about my case even though I knew it's exact location. Come to find out, I get to Amsterdam, find the luggage, open it up, and someone had stolen my stuff - it was extremely disappointing finding out that some lazy loser decided to take the things I worked hard for.

### "just a tad above low cost"
KLM's customer care is useless. When it good, it's good. But if you have any sort of issue with your KLM flight is like dealing with some low cost airline. Their customer support agents can't help you with anything, I'm not even sure why they are still employed and why they are willing to put themselves through it. I got refunds rejected with no details, just "because it does not meet the criteria listed on the website" with no additional details. They have an army working at Schiphol, but only a handful of agents at the customer support desk that would have to help hundreds of travellers in case of any issues. Their in-flight services are also just a tad above low cost. KLM just gives you the vibe of a has-been airline. Complacent employees, complex services, and they have the attitude they make you a favor by taking your business.

### "experience was a nightmare"
My experience was a nightmare. After having a poor experience, some years ago, I decided to give KLM another chance. My first flight was in July from Paris to Manila via Amsterdam. It was “OK,” but nothing to write home about. In August I was traveling to Athens with my family when a flight was changed and I was shuffled to KLM in order to be able to connect with an ongoing flight to a Greek island from Athens. On boarding in Paris, we were told that my granddaughter’s infant seat could be used on the plane. However, when we got to the plane, the infant seat was basically seized and we were told that it had been gate checked. It was not. It did not arrive in Athens for three weeks. Moreover, the other five suitcases that we had checked did not arrive either. It was exasperating, because we had rented a large space and were expecting seven other people to join us the following day on the island. Although I realize that “it is what it is,” the baggage experience with KLM was crushing, really depressing. Although we were late for our connection to the Greek island because of the lost baggage, which required filing immediate claims, KLM refused to cover any expenses of our overnight stay at a hotel. After we arrived on the island of the following day, which required buying five new tickets, the telephone numbers and email address provided by KLM to check our baggage never answered one single inquiry, and there were many – more than 10. We finally found the baggage ourselves, because my son was traveling with an Apple AirTag. However, we could not inform KLM of that because no one was answering either phone or email. We finally received five of the suitcases on the fourth day of our trip, and the infant seat on the last day of the trip, weeks later. If there had been even the slightest caring message, or concerned response from KLM, I would not be writing this review, but throughout, the KLM response was shameful. I will never fly that airline again.

### "KLM is now recommended"
KLM City Hopper AKA regional route. With low expectation of the KLM crews based on previous experiences, flown with Rude and arrogant crews. It surprised me with the smile on their faces on a short hop to the German's capital so does vice versa. Booked economy fare and upgraded to economy comfort with extra leg room seats that was done few hours prior to departure as Skyteam Gold holder's entitlement. Both Flights were smooth. Non-english speakers just be prepared to be lost in translation when hearing KLM's announcement as they only do it in English despite it's a Dutch flag carrier. Lounge at Schengen gate is great. KLM is now recommended although the 10 Euros booking fee per booking is still exist even though booked on KLM's website.

### "poor ground force communication"
It was a flight operated by KLM Cityhopper. It is however much lower comfort compared to same route operated by KLM using Airbus/Boeing planes. 1h delayed flight with poor ground force communication. Tight space even in business class, having to share personal space with person seated next to me. Crew always very friendly as usual high standard KLM service.

### "still respecting scheduled times"
One of the few airline still respecting scheduled times. Crew extremely helpful and kind. Good variety and upper quality food. Sodas and snacks were available all flight long

### "becoming one of the world's worst"
Not Verified |  KLM is becoming one of the world's worst. Cancelled the 13:30 flight from Ncl to Ams for allegedly 'bad weather' 2hrs before the flight (we were at the airport), then they booked us on another flight (17:30) same day and as a gesture of goodwill they offered an upgrade then whilst at the airport. 2hrs before sent an email booking us the next day and when we called then, they said both bookings were an error, booked us on a different flight and believe it or not, the 'goodwill' upgrade offered was withdrawn.

### "the nightmare of lost luggage"
Not Verified |  I seem to be yet another KLM patron that has had to endure the nightmare of lost luggage. In my case both my wife and my own luggage was lost for almost 40 days. The entire duration of our European holiday. KLM were not interested at all in the lost luggage but rather told me I had to deal with "Swissport" the luggage handling company. Swissport rarely answer their support phone line and never respond to emails sent to their support team. Over a three week period I attempted to contact them over 20 occasions, having received 3 responses. Impossible and frustrating. After 31 days the luggage was considered lost and I was told by Swissport that they would no longer help me find our luggage. I was told to raise the problem with KLM. The nightmare continued KLM as you try to engage with a support representative. Eventually when KLM are ready to engage with you, you will get to communicate with a support person and progress is made. After the frustration, delays, misinformation and time wasting your case will get closed with most (in my case not all) of your claim being satisfied. Good luck if you loose your luggage on a KLM flight

### "they refused to help me in any way"
Not Verified |  I purchased a ticket from Amsterdam to Catania passing via Milan. Only they did not clearly state that this flight was from Amsterdam to Milan Malpensa and then i had to go on my expenses to Milan Linate airport to take the 2nd flight to Catania. The first flight was in delay and i had to spend 115 euro to go the other airport by taxi to not miss my second flight. This ticket was done by KLM website, searching a flight to Catania from Amsterdam. When i contacted them they refused to help me in any way, not even by refund me money i spent for the taxi.

### "too late to apply for a refund"
Horrible customer service, baggage lost and deny of the promised refund. This horrible airline just "lost" my baggage in Amsterdam instead of sending it to Ecuador. They told me already when we landed, so clearly KLMs known fault. I got really into trouble as the check-in baggage needed about 1 week to arrive and I had my diabetes medicine in it. I tried to reach several times the corresponding numbers, but they ignored me on purpose. After this nightmare was over and I finally got my baggage and medicine back I continued my holiday and after getting back applied for the refund of $80 for clothes and stuff for the first week. The airline even rejected my request with the reasoning that I am a few days too late to apply for a refund. I tried to reach them again, but I get ignored since then. Really disgusting behavior and I suggest you to avoid this bad airline.

### “A true disappointment”
Not Verified | Flew back on KL736 on 13 September 2023, seat 1A full fare business class. Seat is damaged and does not recline. Purser, embarrassed, offered a €200 refund. Today, 19 October 2023, still nothing. In the KLM claims website it states “you were not satisfied with your seating” whereas the truth is the seat was not functioning, not reclining and not responding, as should a chair in (overpriced) business class! Why not call the facts, instead of stating a misleading distortion of the facts?…This of course camouflages KLM’s unwillingness to issue the promised voucher of €200, the least they can do as an airline that calls itself respectable and reliable. A true disappointment, and by far not what a KLM in the distant past used to be.

### "disgusting customer service"
Not Verified | Absolutely disgusting customer service and performance form this terrible airline. Missing baggage, rude customer service reps, avoiding paying refunds. My advice would to not fly with them.

### “this last trip was simply a nightmare”
I booked my flight directly with the airline to avoid any hassles and to have the security of dealing directly with them in case of a mishap. I have previously had good experiences with KLM and it's usually my airline of choice to travel to Mexico from Europe. However this last trip was simply a nightmare. After only being informed of delay 1.5 hrs before departure (even though all flights had already had delays that day), I of course would miss my connecting flight to Mexico so I called the customer service line to help me find a solution, they first simply told me that there were no more flights to Mexico so there was nothing they could do. After spending 54min on hold they finally offered to re route me through a BA flight leaving later that night. The purpose of my travel was already ruined and I would be missing the event I was traveling for but I accepted this as the only option of still making my trip. 3 hours before the BA flight was set to depart the flight was cancelled without reason provided. When speaking again to the re-booking agent he said he understood he would cancel my booking at this stage and just claim a refund for me, I continuously asked on the phone if I would get a full refund since the flight delays and cancellations were not on my behalf and I had not taken any of my flights, which he assured me should be the case and I should expect a refund for all of the flights. A few days later I received a refund only for tax and government fees (about 10% of total ticket cost) claiming that I had voluntarily cancelled my flight which is so wrong! Since then I have tried multiple times to speak with a customer representative to understand the policy and situation, this has been impossible! Website is constantly malfunctioning and customer service lines just hang up the line! It is so disappointing and has turned me from a loyal customer to never wanting to travel with KLM ever again. They have literally stolen the money from my ticket and twisted the situation to their convenience when no accurate information was given at the time of flight delay and cancellation.

### "a rollercoaster of a customer service journey"
Not Verified |  Get yourself ready for an unforgettable trip with KLM, you will definitely get that from KLM, especially when they lose your luggage and take you on a rollercoaster of a customer service journey, BTW, actually there is no customer service. Having said that, KLM has great inflight service, however if they lose your luggage, you will be amazed at the lack of customer service and support, and then deal with AI attendants leaving with you with no resolution to your service issue, please change the name of customer service to "no customer service", please help KLM find their end to end customer service. They could be so much better, in the meantime, avoid travelling with them until they get their act together and actual take care of the paying passengers There are other good reliable air travel choices and they actually care!

### "clear ‍the ‍agents ‍weren’t ‍that ‍interested2
In ‍March 2023, ‍we ‍purchased ‍seat ‍upgrades ‍for ‍our ‍4 ‍flights. ‍We’d ‍had ‍confirmation ‍and ‍our ‍seats ‍showed ‍up ‍on ‍KLM’s ‍“My ‍Trip” ‍website. ‍The ‍first ‍issue ‍was ‍fairly ‍unimportant ‍and ‍not ‍uncommon. ‍KLM ‍had ‍offloaded ‍our ‍first ‍flight ‍to ‍German ‍Airways ‍who ‍only ‍have ‍one ‍seating ‍level ‍in ‍economy; ‍our ‍seat ‍numbers ‍remained ‍the ‍same. ‍However, ‍KLM ‍did ‍nothing ‍about ‍the ‍amount ‍paid ‍for ‍upgrade. ‍I ‍applied ‍for ‍a ‍refund ‍which, ‍after ‍2 ‍weeks, ‍appeared. ‍And ‍then ‍the ‍nightmare ‍began. ‍On ‍28th ‍September 2023, ‍we ‍noticed ‍all ‍the ‍booked ‍seats, ‍apart ‍from ‍German ‍Airways ‍had ‍disappeared. ‍A ‍phone ‍call ‍to ‍customer ‍services ‍resulted ‍in ‍their ‍reinstatement. ‍Just ‍24 ‍hours ‍later, ‍they ‍were ‍gone. ‍This ‍was ‍the ‍first ‍of ‍4 ‍repeat ‍calls, ‍and ‍an ‍identical ‍pattern. ‍Reinstated ‍and ‍disappearing ‍24 ‍hours ‍later. ‍Every ‍time ‍unequivocal ‍promises ‍were ‍made ‍that ‍the ‍seats ‍would ‍stay ‍in ‍place. ‍Emails ‍were ‍sent ‍to ‍confirm ‍this. ‍Annoyingly, ‍during ‍this ‍period, ‍our ‍seats ‍on ‍one ‍flight ‍had ‍been ‍sold ‍and ‍no ‍more ‍“upgraded” ‍seats ‍remained. ‍We ‍reluctantly ‍accepted ‍nearby ‍standard ‍seats. ‍Having ‍had ‍enough ‍of ‍phoning, ‍I ‍moved ‍to ‍their ‍Facebook ‍chat ‍channel. ‍A ‍further ‍6 ‍interactions ‍produced ‍much ‍the ‍same ‍result. ‍At ‍one ‍point, ‍the ‍agent ‍said ‍the ‍problem ‍was ‍the ‍“reserved” ‍seats ‍now ‍cost ‍more ‍than ‍we’d ‍paid ‍so ‍we’d ‍need ‍to ‍pay ‍the ‍difference. ‍My ‍reply ‍did ‍not ‍include ‍the ‍expletives ‍I ‍was ‍thinking. ‍I ‍wasn’t ‍paying. ‍It ‍was ‍clear ‍the ‍agents ‍weren’t ‍that ‍interested, ‍several ‍times ‍saying ‍“be ‍patient, ‍another ‍department ‍is ‍handling ‍the ‍problem”. ‍Time ‍to ‍move ‍on, ‍so ‍I ‍called ‍my agent's flight ‍office. ‍What ‍a ‍difference! ‍A ‍very ‍polite ‍and ‍friendly ‍agent ‍told ‍me ‍that ‍it ‍was ‍something ‍they ‍didn’t ‍deal ‍with ‍(I’d ‍bought ‍the ‍seats ‍from ‍the ‍airline.) ‍“However, ‍leave ‍it ‍with ‍me ‍in ‍case ‍there’s ‍anything ‍I ‍can ‍do ‍and ‍I’ll ‍phone ‍you ‍back.” ‍About ‍2 ‍hours ‍later ‍she ‍phoned ‍back ‍and ‍told ‍me ‍she’d ‍spent ‍40 ‍minutes ‍on ‍the ‍phone ‍with ‍KLM’s ‍“Trade ‍Liaison” ‍office. ‍She ‍said ‍although ‍they ‍couldn’t ‍complete ‍“the ‍fix” ‍they’d ‍identified ‍the ‍real ‍problem. ‍I’d ‍booked ‍the ‍seats ‍before ‍they ‍had ‍issued ‍the ‍ticket. ‍The ‍computer ‍had ‍not ‍allocated ‍my ‍payments ‍to ‍the ‍correct ‍ticket ‍number. ‍I’d ‍have ‍to ‍phone ‍KLM ‍because ‍his ‍“office ‍id” ‍couldn’t ‍make ‍that ‍sort ‍of ‍change. ‍She ‍then ‍gave ‍me ‍a ‍glossary ‍of ‍KLM ‍buzz-words ‍to ‍convince ‍Customer ‍Service ‍I ‍knew ‍what ‍I ‍was ‍talking ‍about. ‍It ‍took ‍1¼ ‍hours ‍on ‍the ‍phone, ‍but ‍with ‍the ‍apology ‍for ‍the ‍time ‍it ‍had ‍taken, ‍she ‍explained ‍that ‍adjusting ‍seat ‍prices ‍to ‍match ‍my ‍payments ‍was ‍very ‍complicated. ‍It ‍was ‍obvious ‍to ‍me ‍that ‍the ‍Facebook ‍agent ‍was ‍doing ‍nothing ‍until ‍I ‍backed ‍down ‍and ‍handed ‍over ‍more ‍cash. It ‍had ‍taken ‍around ‍11 ‍days, ‍5+ ‍hour ‍of ‍phone ‍calls ‍and ‍message ‍exchanges, ‍not ‍to ‍mention ‍stress ‍about ‍flights, ‍all ‍of ‍this ‍to ‍sort ‍out ‍a ‍bug ‍in ‍their ‍computer ‍system.

### "Rude and unhelpful staff"
After I boarded my flight to Mumbai, the flight attendant informed me that my business class seat does not recline. It's a long flight and fully booked. So too bad nothing can be done. The attendant was super rude and refused to help in any way. Very disappointed and unhappy with the service. It was a special 50th birthday holiday which KLM ruined. No thanks to the airline. Rude and unhelpful staff.

### "Nothing changes with KLM, except for the worse"
Nothing changes with KLM, except for the worse. The locker above me and across from was full of crew stuff. They are now calling it a daytime flight and "due to passenger demand" serve the 2nd meal in the middle of the flight, ie not long after finishing the first meal, maybe 3 hours. Who wants to eat another full meal 3 hours after having a big meal when all they have done is just sit on a plane? I didn't bother. That left 5 hours of the flight still to go. They said there would be food before landing but that turned out to be a chicken roll. Then 3/4 of the way through watching a movie the screen froze and then the message “IFE Not Working”. When it came back on, that film had disappeared and my list of favourites gone. I went to the toilet right next to me to see, "Out of order". This comes after my last trip 5 months ago on the same flight when they threw me out of my carefully chosen seat to give it to someone else after I had already checked in my luggage at the airport and got my boarding pass, though I had officially checked in the day before online. And Platinum status counts for nothing with them.

### "friendly and jovial cabin crew"
We flew MAN-GOT return via AMS. Love flying KLM and they did not disappoint this time. No check-in issues, no delays, no issues connecting in AMS, no baggage issues - all very smooth and efficient. Helpful ground staff - friendly and jovial cabin crew. Snack and drink service always a bonus. Yes it is a longer journey than flying Ryanair direct; however for me, my top preference for this route is KLM.

### "the worst line at the airport"
KLM would not let us check in on-line before our flight. The check in line at Florence was well over an hour with just two kiosks serving economy. I know it is economy, still it was by far the worst line at the airport this morning.

### "cabin crew on all four legs were great"
Three out of four legs to Vancouver and return were late. Only the last AMS to MAN were on time. A change of aircraft type on the way out meant that most of the passengers in the business cabin were playing musical chairs to sit with their companions. I moved seat three times to accommodate others. The return journey was the same. The two x two x two seating layout is antiquated and we had originally chosen a different aircraft with 1x2x2 seating, meaning we would all have had an aisle seat. The first and last, short haul, flights were in the standard, awful, European business class configuration. In other words an economy seat with 3x3 and the middle seat left empty. That said the cabin crew on all four legs were great. Food was as good as most and better than some. We all got our first choice and there were no issues with dishes running out. One of the great draws in long haul business class with KLM is the Delft cottages filled with Dutch gin which are offered at the end of the flight. These are all numbered and collector's items. No pyjamas and a fairly standard amenity kit. The seat, in long haul, was comfortable and I managed a good four hours of sleep each way.

### "I honestly think for the price it's not that"
I took a Flight with KLM from Amsterdam to Shanghai. Here’s how it went. Price: 800€ Return Class: Economy ## 1) Boarding I started my journey from Brussels. After a couple of minutes looking for the KLM desk at the Brussels Train Station, I finally found it. Although the online check-in didn't work, the physical check-in was seamless as it only took 5 minutes. I then took the Thalys train to Amsterdam. My train arrived late so I had only 1h45 before take-off. For some reason I had Priority, so it sped the process a bit. After security check (with automatic passport check w/ facial recognition! ), I went to the boarding deck. I still had to wait 20 minutes. Then I could finally board. ## 2) Plane experience For this let's just do a positive-neutral-negative points list **The good** - Free *Wi-Fi* allows messaging with limited image sharing. *Large screen* with movies, a dozen games, music, video destination guides and even a Google Earth tool ! *Food* was great. Quality-wise is what you would except whit pre-cooked meals. (I had raviolis, with a slice of bread, actual cheese, olives and Piment stuffed with some kind of cheese.) Quantity-wise I found it satisfying. I had one meal at around 6:30 pm EU time (GMT+1) and one at around 2:00 pm or 8:00 pm on the local schedule. *Toilets*: clean, spacy, often available. **Meh** - *Leg-room* was sufficient but getting in and out was really an hassle. (I'm 1m89). Being in the middle, I always had trouble to get to my seat. *Sleep quality*: First, I wished we could move the table up and down. The only way I can sleep is putting my head on a table. But since there's no place to stretch, I have to put it around my chest level. I had to pile things up. Secondly, I wished the screen could be locked. So you don't power it on when you rest on it. **The bad** - *Provided earbuds quality:* I didn't expected them to be that bad. I'm not asking more than those school/ office headsets or quality of a 100$ smartphone. But with those while music was logically not possible (that's ok) but even listening to movies was painful: either bump up sound to uncomfortable level or miss parts of dialogues. Sparse subtitles availability didn't helped. Since airline loves charging extras, why not one for "quality" earbuds? Poor *decline* ability. Couldn't fall asleep on those. Not much informational *media* offerings. While a handful of podcasts were offered, there very few episodes of those. Additionally, there is no (virtual) newspaper platform. ## Conclusion : I honestly think for the price it's not that. But it's my first intercontinental and my third flight overall, so my judgement doesn't worth much.

### "shockingly bad customer care"
Not Verified | My flight from Heathrow was delayed (allegedly due to fog at Amsterdam). I missed my connection. KLM utterly failed to rectify this situation and rebook my flight. Their automatic transfer system failed and IT systems appeared to collapse completely. There were no staff at their transfer desk at Schiphol and many passengers were left stranded. I had a spend several hours on the phone to rebook a flight and in the end had to spend two night in Amsterdam and missed an important meeting. No apologies and no customer service. Just shockingly bad customer care. To top it all my return flight was ALSO cancelled and now I'm stranded again thanks to KLM! I will avoid this airline in future.

### "Don‘t fly with them"
Our flight from Saturday 9th September 2023 from Zurich to Amsterdam was cancelled so we couldn‘t get to Glasgow. Then we got rebooked to another flight with landing in Glasgow on Monday at 1pm. We had to call KLM, wait for 20 minutes for someone to pick up the phone whereas the best they could to was rebooking us to a flight on Sunday (with an arrival time of 11.15pm at night). The person on the phone was uncooperative and quite rude. On Sunday our flight had a delay of 2 hours whereas we missed the flight in London and we had to sleep in London for the night. We arrived on Monday morning instead of Saturday evening. On Sunday the hotline was closed, we couldn‘t reach anyone (we tried on 11am before the flight, just to make sure everything goes right). We had to cancel everything twice as we booked a new night at a hotel from Sunday to Monday. KLM never said sorry and is over all uncooperative. Don‘t fly with them.

### "performance was abysmal"
Not Verified | I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with my recent experience with KLM Airlines, specifically concerning flight KL1527 on August 28, 2023. This ordeal has left me deeply unsatisfied and dissuaded from ever considering KLM as a viable airline option in the future. On the mentioned date, I received a text notification informing me of flight cancellations, which led me to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Upon arrival, I was met with the bewildering situation where the KLM customer service desk was closed, leaving passengers in the lurch. Instead of providing proper assistance, KLM staff merely offered basic advice and handed out disruption information letters. According to the initial information provided by KLM staff, my flight was cancelled due to UK traffic control problems. I was instructed to book accommodation on my own and assured that my flight would be rebooked within an hour. Following their advice, I made the necessary arrangements for a room and returned to the city centre via train. However, to my dismay, I did not receive any rebooking notification within the promised timeframe. After waiting in vain, I decided to contact KLM customer care, only to be put on hold for an excruciating 40 minutes. When someone finally answered, they abruptly cut off the call, displaying a complete disregard for the passengers' concerns. I had no choice but to call back, and to my utter disbelief, I was informed that my flight was, in fact, operational, contradicting the previous information given by KLM staff. This inconsistency resulted in a mad scramble to return to the airport and barely make it in time for my flight. Furthermore, despite numerous attempts, I have not received any response from KLM's customer complaints department. To make matters worse, when I revisited the KLM customer service desk at the airport, I encountered an extremely unprofessional and rude agent. He displayed a dismissive attitude and attempted to evade responsibility by suggesting that my flight must have been cancelled at the time, which contradicted the information initially provided by KLM staff. His behaviour was unacceptable. This entire experience has demonstrated an astonishing lack of communication and organizational competence on KLM's part. It is disheartening that an airline with such a long history of operation would fail so miserably in providing essential customer care and accurate information during a crisis. In comparison to budget airlines like Ryanair and easyJet, KLM's performance during this situation was abysmal. In conclusion, I am deeply dissatisfied with KLM Airlines and will never consider flying with them again. The ordeal I endured, along with the lack of proper communication and professionalism, has left a lasting negative impression. I strongly urge KLM to improve its customer care, organizational efficiency, and communication procedures to avoid alienating more passengers in the future.

### "Really very disappointed"
Not Verified |  After checking in and having my boarding passes I went to the airport and when I got to the counter to deposit my bags they told me I have no seat in the plane so they can’t get me in unless someone canceled or arrived late so I had to wait 3 hours and finally I didn’t get to come back on time which I didn’t understand. How come I booked a flight and pay but I didn’t have a seat because they are selling more seats or giving it for people who is paying more. I always flew with Qatar airways but for one time I choose Air France / KLM to fly this year to Africa and I regret choosing this airline. Really very disappointed.

### "the service is horrible"
Not Verified |  Lost my baggage and the service is horrible, it almost seems they are doing everything purposely to not find my baggage. Refusing to add proper description to the suitcases, ignoring requests for pick up. It’s all the Dutch staff acting this ridiculous!

### "overall worse for wear experience"
Not Verified |  General distaste at the direction of KLM product. In-flight staff generally still friendly but website is sub-par, ground service limited, and baggage regularly lost. The process to reclaim funds following lost baggage outdated, changing flights on-line (by yourself) has the same cost penalty as when you reach out to the platinum phone line. Just overall worse for wear experience. Generally feel that in AF-KLM group the ranking is 1. AF (Full-Service Airline), 2. KLM (Premium-Budget) 3. Transavia (Budget).

### "no attempt by KLM to be helpful"
Our baggage (5 in our family) was all delayed for 8 days. I did have an AirTag in one bag, so I knew exactly where they were at all times, yet they lied and denied at every turn. I could write a book, but I will summarize by saying no communication, no attempts to expedite or explain anything, horribly rude, actually mocking me when I was concerned about some of my mother’s belongings. Really put a damper on a vacation that cost tens of thousands of dollars, with no attempt by KLM to be helpful or even just a little sympathetic. We are still waiting over 1 month to be reimbursed for our expenses after taking hours to collect, scan and submit documents. I will never, ever check a bag again, so I guess I learned that lesson?

### "Fly with a competitor"
This is a sad little airline that cares little for its customers. While completely inflexible, they might actually believe they are ALWAYS right. Save your money, reduce your stress. Fly with a competitor

### "All in all great flights"
Not Verified |  Travelled Manchester - Amsterdam - Hamburg and return. All flights well handled and cabin service excellent. Slight delay into Manchester on the return leg due to poor weather. All in all great flights.

### "their service is absolutely abysmal"
Out of 4 segments three were delayed due to technical difficulties and they lost my baggage. It takes them forever to confirm the baggage delivery even after it arrived the following day. I don't understand why they charge three times more than any European low cost, when their service is absolutely abysmal, planes are shabby and food is disgusting. I will never fly with KLM again, and advise everyone else against it.

### "disappointing and unreliable"
Horrible and traumatic experience with KLM. I flew with my husband from Dubai to Toronto via Amsterdam on the 22nd of June 2023. The flight from Amsterdam KL691 was cancelled and rebooked for 23rd June. We boarded KL695 on the 23rd June from Amsterdam to Toronto and arrived with one of our checked in baggages missing since then. The experience with KLM customer service and baggage handling has been extremely frustrating, disappointing and traumatic. The timeline of events include our flight being cancelled and rescheduled, unavailable business class upgrade on the rebooked flight, unexplained loss of checked in baggage, several trips to Toronto airport office only to receive lack of empathy and disdain. Some other passengers also mentioned same experience. I believe KLM does no due diligence to trace missing baggages and feels neither remorse nor accountability for inflicting emotional distress and financial loss as a result of people’s personal properties. I will rather have my baggage than any claim which your bureaucratic and unfriendly system may want to make available in exchange. The horrible treatment and zero customer service is what I get after flying AirFranceKLM even as a frequent traveller for over a decade. Horrible, disappointing and unreliable KLM. Dropped from hero to zero.

### "unprofessionalism of KLM staff"
I boarded my flight Houston to Amsterdam by United Airlines flight #UA 20 Thursday 11, August. I was told by the United staff my next carrier was KLM Airlines I could get my boarding pass in Amsterdam. I got to the KLM counter in Amsterdam & was greeted by a rude and an unhelpful lady. My booking information and passport were both checked and I was informed that I wasn’t even on the flight and that she could do nothing about it, I was told to go to the immigration and check with them. The person at the immigration office was nice, he informed me that I could go to the other KLM counter and they would help me with my boarding pass. I was greeted with the same unprofessional, rude, unhelpful and unknowledgeable KLM counter staff lady with major attitude, I was told I would have to take a number and wait. What would’ve happened if I had an earlier flight with less time to wait?! And that’s what I asked her - she ignored the question and looked the other way. I asked another counter staff if there was a way if she could check about my baggage being put on the plane while I waited to speak to someone about my boarding pass. She said I have to wait my turn. I did not ask her for any special treatment, I just asked her if she could check my baggage tag on the computer since she wasn’t doing anything. Luckily, my flight KL1407 was in a few hours, so it was OK for me to wait. I finally got my boarding pass. I had to change airlines to go to France, I again requested another KLM staff to check my baggage tag to make sure that my bag would be put in the airplane. She said it wasn’t necessary, and she was sure my baggage would be in the plane. She didn’t bother to check the computer to make sure that my baggage would be in that plane. I waited for another 30 minutes and went back to get somebody else to check if my baggage was on the flight. A Male staff on KLM counter checked on the computer saying it was already in the plane and that it would get to the destination along with me. Fast forward to me reaching Montpellier Airport. My baggage did not arrive as promised. Air France office Montpellier, the lady told me my baggage wasn’t on the plane and a claim report had to be made to solve the issue. It was 7pm by the time the claim got done. I was told I would be reimbursed €100. The stress tension and weekend destroyed! Please be very careful if you go to the Amsterdam airport because nobody will help you. Now I have to file a claim online and I’m already sure that it will be another long drawn out affair!! I’m totally disappointed, disillusioned and disgusted with the unprofessionalism of KLM staff.

### "next day was also overbooked"
We got put on standby in Vienna on our flight back to the US. In Amsterdam we got told, that we can't board the plane because of overbooking. They put us in a hotel and gave us vouchers of EUR600 each to compensate for the inconvenience, with a link that I wasn't able to pull up (401 error not found) after finding KLM's page, we put our information in and got a claim number to track. After a week we called the airline to find out what's taking so long and the lady on the phone told us, we would have to put in a request. It was like pulling teeth! She didn't connect us with a supervisor, nor did she tell us her name. Then she talked about it needs to be investigated. Our flight the next day was also overbooked and they asked people to volunteer to give up their flight. I mean seriously? We booked it 6 months ahead of time and didn't get the flight because we didn't reserve seats (which you have to pay for on top of the ticket price). One guy told me, if we would have checked in the day before, we wouldn't have had a problem. Guess what? I tried to check in a day early but it wouldn't let me because I have an Austrian passport  Even though I was on a return flight, it said something about "you might need an ESTA". I don’t need an ESTA. And they should have seen that we are coming back. But I guess the fact, that they put us on a different flight than booked on the way to Austria, screwed them up. Who knows.

### "They lost my luggage"
Awful experience. They lost my luggage and after 4 days I received absolutely no proactive contact and zero explanations. I chased them multiple times through WhatsApp but they never ever shared anything about where my luggage is. This was definitely the last time I have flown with them.

### "Overall good flight"
Flew on the KLM CityHopper from Belfast City Airport to Amsterdam. The overall check in and security process was quite efficient. With Business Class ticket you get access to the ASPIRE lounge which is quite good. The boarding process was just ok; however, the gate team could have organized it better. Once onboard the cabin crew we quite welcoming and the meal several was more than sufficient for the short flying time. Overall good flight and very good onboard friendly service.

### "never travel with them again"
Not Verified |  Traveled with family. Not one of our 5 checked bags arrived with us. So-called service was mostly useless chat bots. After 3 days we got one bag. 4 bags missing and they sent us a request for contents info. They can't talk to us and give actual info, but they are asking if I can identify the gifts I got for the grandkids and my husband's clothes? Hellish. We will never travel with them again.

### "offer free snacks and beverages"
Boarding was incredibly efficient – maybe a personal best for me across the years I have flown. The seat features onboard this flight was extremely ergonomic – everything from the cup holder feature for when tray tables are folded or let out to a convenient place holder for hand held devices and books on top of the front seat were impressive. The staff were humorous and personal. They offer free snacks and beverages. Without even realizing, the 2.5 hour flight went by like a breeze and we were landed in Amsterdam. I’d fly KLM as long as they maintain their initiative to customer comfort like they did on this flight and past ones too.

### "customer service are like robots"
Worst and most horrible airline ever! First of All, I couldn't even eat the food. I tried the pasta and chicken, both was gross and awful. You have to ask 100 times for water. No WiFi connection! They don't give you headphones by a 11 hr flight! You have to beg literally for that. The pillows and blankets they give you (packed) are dirty! Then they lost my luggage! And I still haven't received my luggage since 5 days! Nobody's going to help you at the customer service, really nobody! They are like robots and keep telling you the same! They trying to fool you and treat you like an idiot. This airline is so unprofessional! I paid for an economy ticket 1800€ with 1 stop btw.

### "They basically hung us out to dry"
There were 8 ticket holders in our party. After 14 days spent in Norway, we received notification the night before that our flight home was cancelled, due to weather. The problem is how KLM handled this that my review is being written. They basically hung us out to dry. Not only did they charge us all a second time for seat selection (this was paid on the original booking) but the next available flight wasn’t for 5 days. This is unacceptable and now they are claiming no refund of any extra expenses that the 8 of us incurred while waiting for our next available flight. I was unable to speak to a customer service representative in person as the only option offered was through a chat form. I am so incredibly frustrated and angry at how this company treats its customers. They are claiming “an Act of God” scenario and “we look forward to serving us again soon” was offered. I will never travel with them again, I would have expected better care during this stressful time and some kind of compensation for the unexpected time, expense and inconvenience the extra 5 days of travel was for myself and the rest of our large party. Do not risk your time and hard earned income on this money hungry airline.

### "whole trip went super smooth"
Not Verified | Very tight service. The whole trip went super smooth, crew was super helpful. Nice sandwich on board. Would recommend. The whole trip was well done, compliments to the crew

### "Staggeringly poor baggage handling"
Not Verified |  They lost the bags of the couple we were meeting, took 2 days to get them their bags. They lost about 50 bags out of the 200 people on our flight. They lost my bag, took 3 days to get it to me. They lost my husband’s bag, took 4 days to get it to him. Meanwhile we are well into a Serengeti safari with no gear. Then they lost one of the two bags of the couple we were traveling with on the way back (they were going to SFO we went to LAX.) Not the fault of the crew in Killy by the way. The bags didn’t make it through Amsterdam. Staggeringly poor baggage handling. Couldn’t tell us where the bags were. Couldn't say when or how they would get them to us.

### "their customer service is terrible"
They lost my baggage and their customer service is terrible! Waiting hours on the phone or chat, they disconnect, disappear from the chat, they are unhelpful and just try to get rid of you with any excuse! My baggage has been lost for 24 days now and there has been no updates since the beginning, total silence! No reimbursement, no baggage, I don't think they have ever tried to locate it!. They claim they didn't even get the information about the easily identifiable objects in my suitcase and the suitcase description, which we have submitted!

### "the seats were really narrow"
KLM from Tel Aviv to Amsterdam, direct, with their typical plane for this season of travel on this line, the Boeing 777-200ER. The flight was delayed by around one hour, it was the infamous day of July 5-6 where Schiphol had a severe storm that caused the delay and cancellation of hundreds of flights. Ours was luckily delayed only by one hour because the flight before departed later from Amsterdam. Boarding was not done using zones. People started gathering around the gate standing around 20 minutes before boarding even started. I The flight itself was pretty chill, the crew was very professional and comforting. The breakfast that was given was fruit salad, yogurt and a hot drink. It was okay for an early morning flight. Landing at Schiphol was smooth. My only complaint would be the width of Economy class seats. I am no small person, but also not super large. And yet I found that the seats were really narrow even for thinner people than me. It felt as my hands could only go on the table or that I would need to cross them, in order not to touch the other person. Also seats were lacking padding, they were pretty thin. After one hour of seating my tail bone started aching, and I had to move in my seat every 30 minutes and change my position. I would like to praise though the KLM crew's service and proffesionalism, always greeting with a smile, always helpful.

### "terrible customer service"
The problem with this airline is the terrible customer service. The Agent who answered me as I was not satisfied with her answer I asked to speak with her supervisor and she abruptly refused to communicate with him. She told me that she would not give it to me simply because she did not want to and that she was ending the call, she did not give me her name or agent number. I proceeded to call again to file a complaint with the agent and the line was hung up on me again. On the website they tell you that they will help you but they only proceed in a very rude and abrupt way to hang up on you. Be cautious and do not use this airline until they have good customer service and better train their agents.

### "airline jargon which isn't helpful"
My concern isn't so much about the flights on the round-trip I did, but about the transparency and handling of complaints by the KLM staff. I booked a light-fare and one of the hidden features with that is no mobile boarding pass is available if you travel with hand-luggage only. You get a check-in confirmation if you're lucky, in case of my outbound flight I got the error: sorry we can't check you in because a high priority comment. Sounds much like airline jargon which isn't helpful for the average traveler. The night before the flight I went to the KLM desk at Amsterdam airport and they happily checked me in and explained the issue. I called the call center twice before and their staff had no clue about the issue and couldn't give any explanation. On the way back I had the same issue. Turns out on full flights they physically want to see your hand-luggage to see if it fits. That's the apparent drawback if you book a discount class at KLM.

### "very little to praise KLM"
Apart from friendly crew there's very little to praise KLM. They try to come across glossy and trendy with their ads and brochures and websites but their product is terrible. I'm a Gold member only out of necessity as love in Amsterdam and they're airline need to use most weekends. They only offer a cheese sandwich on European flights which excludes anyone with wheat or gluten or dairy intolerances. There's no alternative. Though I got their gluten free meal on this long haul and it was inedible. And of course no mid flight snacks provided unlike for everyone else. Tip, bring your own snacks with you. Long haul entertainment is extremely limited. Bring your own device and streaming service. They have little on offer and any tv series are never from the beginning. What's the point in starting a new show you've not seen before on Season 4, Episode 8? Flights are nearly always delayed (again I fly with them almost every weekend). Almost without fail. I expect a delayed message from them every Friday before I set out for Schiphol. Their lounge in Schengen zone of Schiphol is truly dreadful - too busy, hardly any food or drinks on offer. However, they're second lounge for non Schengen is very good and praise where praise is due. I just wish they'd stop discrimination against people with food allergies. Bring in a buy on board like most airlines and therefore have a selection to choose from - people would pay. Getting your bags back has improved though I see from messages below, it's still an issue. Plus, they aren't cheap. So no bang for your buck.

### "absolute worst customer service"
Not Verified | The absolute worst customer service. Did not even try to help and tried to upcharge for no apparent reason. This has been the worst international experience I’ve had! Will not go through Delta/KLM flights again! They delayed my luggage so I was stuck internationally with nothing! No assistance in helping what so ever and had a terrible attitude.

### "I’m cursing at KLM service"
They force to check in small cabin luggage, although you have a tight connection after and might miss your train. KLM used to be one of my favourites airlines, unfortunately the service quality dropped off dramatically last years. I can give an example from today. Firstly, I could not check in online because of the flight was overbooked. Therefore I had to arrived earlier to the airport to the check in counter, although I didn’t have any check in luggage. The line was very long, and it was already a bit stressful to wait there. Secondly, they FORCED me to check in my small cabin luggage that I had with me, although I EXPLAINED MANY TIMES, that I have a train to catch, and additional waiting for a luggage after arrival will almost surely end up missing my connection. I understand that there sometimes there is no place for all luggage’s on board, but they should not force passengers with very valid reason for not doing it. As I supposed before, after landing I waited for a luggage for 25min, and missed my train connection. I’m cursing at KLM service. Thanks for many flights, but not recommended anymore.

### "I don't know where my bag is"
KLM baggage system's fault that baggage was not loaded for most of the passengers on that specific flight, however the ordeal followed after, trying to figure out the whereabouts of the baggage is horrible and unexplainable. Apologizing without intention to help is not considered an apology. Had a flight from Amsterdam Schiphol to Berlin Brandenburg airport on 28th June via KLM. I was going for 3 days corporate event. Landed in Brandenburg airport on @ 17:03 CET, awaiting for my checked in baggage at belt 9 - After about 30 min of waiting, there was an announcement where I learned my bag was never loaded on my flight and left at Schiphol airport. I went to the customer service counter, filed the report on the missing bag received a file reference which i need to use for follow ups. Since the 28th June evening, I have been trying to find my bag which I really needed due to a big corporate event I went to Berlin for. Carried a checked bag due to gifts for collogues coming from different countries. I flew back to Amsterdam / Schiphol on 1st July without my bag. Had to buy stuff in Berlin where had no time to spare. So much inconvenience for an hour flight and 3 day visit. Today it's the 6th of July, I don't know where my bag is. The hassle and harassment I had to go through past 1 week, just to get some info on my bag is horrible. Going forward I would do everything humanly possible to avoid KLM flights.

### "hide behind user unfriendly web forms"
I bought 3 tickets for my family on June 12, 2022 for trip Zagreb-Amsterdam-Bergen-Amsterdam-Zagreb planed for March 2023. So, it was 9 months in advance. But 5 months after purchasing tickets I received an e-mail from KLM with totally new flights schedule that devasted my original plan, hotel reservations, date of return etc. But, ok, it was still in advance and I rearranged all the things including the newly appeared overnight stay in Amsterdam on way back to Zagreb. On the very beginning of our trip at flight from Zagreb to Bergen one of our bags was lost so we spend the first day in Bergen without our warm clothing. But real horror is coming at our way back from Bergen to Zagreb via Amsterdam. On March 17, 2023. we were supposed to arrive from Tromso to Bergen by Wideroe flight at 12:40, and then continue to Amsterdam by KLM flight at 14:20. We were (online) check-in for flight from Bergen to Amsterdam. Flight from Tromso was slightly delayed (for 30 minutes) but still more than an hour before departure of KLM flight. While waiting for baggage I immediately try to contact KLM agent at Bergen airport to ask for advice how to continue our trip but there was literally nobody from KLM to help us, only automatic check-in machines and "people-less" baggage drop-in counters. It was 60 minutes before departure of KLM flight from Bergen to Amsterdam. After baggage was delivered we try to check in for Bergen but automatic check-in machine rejected our tickets, although I made on-line check in 30 hours in advance. I was continuously trying to contact KLM service desk at +47 22 64 37 52 and by WhatsApp to get help or advice, but was waiting in the queue and connected to agent only at 14:19. Suggestion was to contact KLM agent at Bergen airport, but there was no / any KLM agent at Bergen airport at that time. So, I was forced to purchase new tickets by the Internet from KLM site for really extremely high price. Alternative was to stay and wait (for what?) at Bergen airport… After returning from the trip, calvary with KLM Customer Care Service, is continuing… After tens of repeated messages and inquiries and 2 months, I manage to get refund for overnight stay in Amsterdam and small 'compensation' for lost baggage, but no chance to resolve issue with "no help, no service, no agent" at Bergen airport and forcing me to buy new, extra expensive tickets for the flight that we already had tickets and were check-in. Customer care agents" replied to my web form inquiries and claims (replied only from time to time) that they are not authorized to "interfere with decisions of other department"  and just give general "psychological" help, express "general understanding and regret", but not solving the issue. The KLM approach to customer care is to hide behind user unfriendly web forms and in fact, just like at the airport in Bergen, there is no possibility of real and direct communication with someone who is authorized and able to solve real problems. After all, my suggestion to KLM is to use motto "We do not care about you!". !

### "KLM service becomes horrible"
KLM service becomes horrible, long delays, and they lost my luggage (5) of them and I paid 500 Euro for extra luggage. They delivered 3 of the luggages after 3-4 days, 2 of them still missing in Amsterdam airport. I have Apple track inside the luggages and I am monitoring it, we send the picture of luggages, exact location of luggage numerous time and still they have not delivered my luggages. We are seeing luggages are inside the airplane bonds in location and they are not shipping to us. They are not good airline.

### "I expect better"
Not Verified |  Not happy with my wife’s experience. Bags have been lost for 1 week. Also, a hundred or so passengers from her connecting flight through Amsterdam to Venice also didn’t get their bags when landing. Why send hundreds of passengers and continuous flights without their baggage? I know the answer. It’s greed and the bottom line of KLM, and not customer care. You call the helpline, and they have no answers. The cost of flying is a small fortune these days and I expect better. Do you think they’re going to cover the hockey camp that is already paid for and the new hockey equipment?

### "not assisting or doing anything to help"
I took a flight with KLM via Amsterdam, they just left my luggage there for the past 5 days no answer, no update, they now don't know where they left it and holding my bag hostage! I came back home to a new place, I have no clothes, no shoes, they are not assisting or doing anything to help! I paid 1600+ USD for this flight and they didn't think it earned me my bag being transferred along with me! As long with 20 other passengers on the flight, however, some of them got their bags already and I ordered months in advance the Asian vegetarian meal, they gave me pizza and a salad with mayo which I don't eat.

### "I am so disappointed"
Not Verified |  Very poor baggage services from KLM. It’s been five (5) whole days since my arrival and KLM still cannot find all 3 of my checked-in bags! My transit flights were operated by Virgin Atlantic and Delta Airlines and they have both confirmed the bags went into KLM’s custody In Amsterdam. KLM has not attached any sense of urgency to the issue. At least, send one of the bags and tell me to wait for the other two! I am so disappointed. I do not recommend KLM at this time.

### "my baggage is missing"
I was scheduled to fly from Amsterdam to Toronto on the 22nd of June on KL691 which was eventually cancelled and passengers rebooked. I was then rebooked to fly on 23rd June on KL695. Since arrival in Toronto on the 23rd June till date being 1st July, my baggage is missing and KLM has not given me any reasonable information on the missing baggage. Customer Service response lacks empathy with zero respect for people’s feelings and troubles being experienced as a result of the airlines’ inefficiency. Several visits to YYZ airport has also not helped in any way. Staff not willing to help, just give terse response and dismiss the customer. KLM should find my bag and return it to me. The distress of waiting for a checked in bag for several days and possibly weeks is unimaginable, particularly with an unresponsive and careless airline. The impression now is run away from KLM, no good and honest service anymore. No longer a reliable airline.

### "customer service is horrible"
Not Verified |  The KLM Europe agent changed my return date flight, per my request, but he forgot to issue the actual ticket. So the KLM auto system automatically canceled my ticket 24 hours before the flight. A day before the flight, I saw on klm.com that I was eligible for checking-in for the flight but then their system canceled my ticket and I was not able to fly that morning. The KLM has no agent or office in Prague airport. The KLM Europe office has limited hours: they are closed on weekends and holidays - exactly when many people are flying. Their customer service is horrible. You can't get them resolve any issue with your ticket.

### "staff are friendly and this flight no exception"
I'm a big KLM fan so my review is slightly biased. I'm probably unusual in that I actually enjoy an 11 hour flight with them-even if squashed into Economy. This was a full flight, 425 passengers, all expecting to be fed, watered and presumably pampered, down at the other end of the plane. The crew dealt with the vast numbers of people well. KLM staff are generally pretty friendly and this flight was no exception. One massive plus point I've noticed with KLM over the years is they match your formality level. I'm quite relaxed and the crew match that by calling me by my first name etc. Food was adequate for such a long flight. There was a main meal not long after take off followed by a mid-flight snack and a sandwich just before landing. The beverage trolley was wheeled out a few times. Usual tiny airline food portions however but was quite tasty-aside from a horrible coconut type dessert thing. KLM give bottled water instead of those weird plastic pots with the foil lid that guarantee you will drench the passenger sat on your lap in Economy. This is good. IFE with KLM is always slightly disappointing. Yes, there's a lot to choose from but the vast majority is American rubbish! Why the fixation with US content?? You're a Dutch airline. Show some European solidarity. I can't be the only one who doesn't want Americans screaming at me for an 11 hour flight-if I did, I'd fly Delta!

### "a horrible experience"
Not Verified |  The KLM customer service on the phone did not complete the change of my ticket date and my paid ticket got canceled by KLM computers. At the airport in Prague, there is no KLM office or agent. Nobody was able to finish issuing the ticket with the new departure date. Nobody help with anything. The KLM office is closed on Sundays, nobody to call. What a horrible experience! It's unacceptable that the KLM airline agents are closed on weekends and the work hours are short.

### "put on standby at the end of June"
Bought tickets in March and been put on standby at the end of June. No seat for us. Zero respect for people's time/life, just to make a few more bucks you let intentionally some travellers to sit at the airport, waste time, stress terribly.

### "carrier is unreliable"
Not Verified |  One expects of the Royal Dutch Airlines to deliver a service for a given price. KLM has left the path of reliability in it's quest to follow cost cutters like Ryanair and the like resulting in top heavy schedules with a lot if strain on pilots and cabin personnel resulting on delays of more than 1.5 hrs on a straightforward flight like this one from Aberdeen to Schiphol. Many people missed flight connections, I missed a train connection. The pilot himself said "this flights is running behind schedule all day" That, dear customer, is man made. Therefore, based on my objective experience today, I do not recommend you to fly KLM. The air carrier is unreliable.

### "the most awful experience"
I've had the most awful experience with KLM. I recently lost a loved one which meant that I couldn't travel on the dates in late August 2023 that I had initially intended on travelling. I contacted the customer care team, and staff member refused to support me with any assistance that was tangible, she refused to refund me my ticket, which I had initially purchased for nearly 700 pounds. I was looking into alternative dates that I may want to travel and I was advised that it would cost an additional 550 pounds to purchase a new Ticket. I shan't book a ticket with KLM ever again.

### "avoid flying this airline"
Do not fly KLM Cityhoppers, between London City Airport and Amsterdam! Both of my flights were either cancelled and delayed! What followed next showed an airline that was not only trying to nickel and dime its passengers at every opportunity, but also had no clue what the rest of the industry was doing! On the day of my departure, I received an email informing me that my flight was cancelled and that I would be rebooked on a different flight soon. When I saw the message displayed an option to change flight or request refund, I followed the link. Then I realized KLM would charge me extra to change my flight. How ridiculous! You cancelled my flight and asked me to pay more to make a change! When I called the service center, I was told that the flight was not canceled and everything was on schedule. So I went a ahead and checked in online. But when I arrived at the airport (LCY) the next day, the billboard showed my flight was indeed cancelled! And I had been rebooked to al later flight. On the day of my return, my flight was delayed. So I wanted to catch an earlier flight at the airport. And I had to do this at a service center where there was a long line. My Sky priority status made no difference, although KLM displayed two queues--Sky priority and General Boarding. I took my number and waited, and waited. 30 minutes later the line hardly moved. So I decided to give it a try at the gate. When I reached a KLM gate, I was told I would have to pay a fee to change to another flight. How ridiculous! You delayed my flight and forced me to stick to the same flight, unless I am offering some extra money. And the gate agent could not change my reservation and I would have to go to a transfer center somewhere far in the terminal. And there was not other flight available. In sum, I don't remember I ever ran into problems on both flights of a round trip and also was told to pay a fee to change a flight even if it was not my fault. KLM takes no responsibility for its own poor performance. I will do everything possible in the future to avoid flying this airline!

### "deceiving experience for a big big price"
Not Verified |  Bad experience. Delayed luggage (4 days) on arrival to Florence. We had to buy clothes and toiletries in Florence. The standard store receipts were rejected for the refund because they didn’t have enough details. On our way back the first flight was delayed so we missed the correspondence and had to wait 25 hours for the next flight. Overall extensively deceiving experience for a big big price. Never again KLM.

### "put on standby for the flight"
Not Verified |  Before my trip to Vietnam, I booked with KLM, first put on standby for the flight to Paris, then also put on standby for Ho Chi Minh, then to Hanoi I was not on the passenger list. The flight I was supposed to have was now full. A ticket is no guarantee to actually fly! What makes it worse; it's business as usual, so as a passenger you just have to deal with it. Employees were disinterested and even completely unwilling to help at Schiphol. Was stunned that KLM's service level had dropped to this level. Finally got in touch with customer service; apologies and the message that I did arrive at destination so that's why they don't apply compensation. They also indicated that it was normal that a flight was overbooked and that you could be placed on standby. Wanted to speak to a manager, but they said they would close the case and stop responding to my emails. Horrible start to the holiday and cringeworthy service. Ben voor mijn reis naar Vietnam geboekt bij KLM eerst standby gezet voor de vlucht naar Parijs, vervolgens ook standby gezet voor Ho Chi Minh, daarna naar Hanoi stond ik niet op de passagierslijst. De vlucht die ik moest hebben zat inmiddels vol. Een ticket is geen garantie om daadwerkelijk te gaan vliegen!! Wat het erger maakt; het is de gewone gang van zaken, dus je hebt het er als passagier maar mee te doen. Medewerkers waren ongeïnteresseerd en op Schiphol zelfs totaal niet bereid te helpen. Was verbluft dat het serviceniveau van KLM naar dit niveau was gedaald. Uiteindelijk contact gehad met de klantenservice; excuses en de boodschap dat ik wel op bestemming was aangekomen dus daarom hanteren ze geen compensatie. Ook gaven ze nog aan dat het normaal was dat een vlucht overbooked was en je standby geplaatst kon worden. Wilde een manager spreken, maar ze gaven aan de case te sluiten en niet meer op mijn mails te reageren. Afschuwelijke start van de vakantie en tenenkrommende service.

### "I do expect better than this"
Not Verified |  We were flying from Washington, D.C. to Cardiff in the UK. The trouble began when we were about to board a connecting flight at JFK in New York City: the flight from Amsterdam to Cardiff was cancelled literally 30 minutes before we boarded the flight out to Amsterdam. We were held at the gate while they rebooked everything, and we nearly missed our flight. The flight to Amsterdam was rough: we wanted to sleep, but there were very loud passengers behind us, and they wouldn't be quiet for a minute. Once in Amsterdam, we were routed to Edinburgh in Scotland, then flown to Cardiff on Loganair. We were told we might have additional baggage fees, but we lucked out and this didn't happen. We got to Cardiff about five hours late, and we were exhausted by then. We had to fly back on KLM, and the fun started again. The plane was held up on the tarmac in Cardiff after they realized the plane was leaking deicer fluid from the wings, and we sat there in a hot plane for about 90 minutes while a technician tried to fix it. At one point, they announced the plane would not be able to fly. However, they were able to fix it somehow, so we weren't forced to get rebooked for another flight and spend hours waiting around Cardiff. The flight from Amsterdam to Dulles in D.C. was relatively harmless, although I found the flight attendant we had rather rude. She lectured me at one point because I had put some trash in a plastic water bottle. Finally, we made it back to D.C. and through passport control. And we started waiting for our luggage on the carousel, and we waited and waited for one large bag, because, as it turned out, it had been left behind in Amsterdam. So, we had to file a claim and wait two more days until our bag finally showed up. My wife was taking another trip and only had a day to do laundry afterward. I wasn't impressed overall. I don't expect the moon flying in economy, but I do expect better than this.

### "KLM never again"
Our flight from Montreal to London was late. At Heathrow airport, despite rushing to make our KLM connection out of terminal 4, when we got to the counter, bagage drop was closed so we missed our flight. We asked the agent where we could buy another ticket, she points to a poster and says: Call that number. Not, let me help you or let's see if there is room on later flights. No! Just call that number. We asked her where was the KLM customer service counter so we could speak with a real person. She said that KLM had cut that service because they were cutting costs. She seemed very displeased by that. And made it clear that missing our flight was not to be her problem. After 80 min. on our cell phone ($190.00 charge! ), we manage to buy 2 tickets ($$$). We waited 10 hours at the airport for the flight. The flight itself was good. But customer service was non existent!!! KLM never again.

### "This was a first, and not in a good way"
This was a first, and not in a good way. I book my flights well in advance to get the seat I want. Like for a lot of people, this is very important to me, I especially wouldn't fly in a window seat long haul as it would be like being in prison. So I booked the seat I wanted. I looked a couple of days before the flight and it was still ok and checked in as soon as I could. At the airport, Bangkok, I checked in my luggage at the desk about 2.5 hours before the flight, and was given a boarding pass, still showing my choice of seat. When they announced boarding, about 40 mins before take-off, my boarding pass was refused and the KLM staff said I had been kicked out of my seat for a, "family". When the business section was full I had a look and there were no children so they must have called a family just a couple who couldn't be bothered to book their seats in advance. This is the only time in doing this route for 33 years with various airlines that this has happened and, even as a platinum member, I will not put myself at risk of it happening again as it ruined the entire flight. Bye Bye KLM.

### "loses my baggage on the same route"
Already second time within two months that KLM loses my baggage on the same route. I'm working offshore and I have no time to wait in hotel until my baggage will be found.

### "KLM got very bad"
KLM got very bad. Must be one of the worst European airlines nowadays. Flown with them twice in the last 2 weeks. Old planes and always delayed, not great cabin crew neither. What has happened with KLM?

### "Premium prices for budget service"
This airline was once a premium choice but in recent years the management has basically imploded. Flights get cancelled all time and rebooked to terrible options without notice. On one single trip, we were rebooked 5 times on inward and outward flights and only after writing angry messages were we offered a normal alternative to a new flight that included two 6 hours layovers, which was supposed to have none. No food vouchers offered, you have to force them to do everything and therefore force you to become an annoying passenger for the unfortunate ground personell. Last but not least, our last flight was delayed by two hours and the only offered option instead of our actual transfer flight was to stay at the airport for 10 hours, again no offers of food or lounge without going to the counter and waiting in line for an hour. What took the crown was that our automatically rebooked flights and human rebooked flights were all still in the system with no tickets reissued. That meant that we were unable to check in, unable to reserve seats, unable to get the seats we payed for and altogether made it impossible for the lady at the counter to understand what was going on without calling KLM directly. The only thing they cared about at the gate was upgrading passengers that wanted to pay extra. They all had priority over the bunch of people with no seats. Premium prices for budget service. Just do yourself a favour and pick any other airline.

### "check process was a shambles"
The check process was a shambles - the bag drop system was broken down and the check in desks were moving incredibly slowly. Worst still, when we were finally loaded on the plane they advised us we would going nowhere for an hour as there were delays in Amsterdam. Why load the plane at all?

### "A wonderful experience"
A wonderful experience. Their cabin crew help you with whatever was possible. On return the gate agent helped me to reschedule my flight in a way I got an entire day in Amsterdam.

### "an aggravating experience"
Not Verified | Terrible app that crashes constantly and has incorrect info such as the flight gate, etc, was boarding my flight and I was told that I had to go to another line and wait to fill out "security" questions which I have never needed to do in any other flight, international or not and when I asked the clerk behind the counter they said "America needs to know where you'll be staying" I'm an American citizen, I'll be staying in my home I shouldn't have to be questioned on when/where I will be staying especially when I was never told before hand that this info would even be needed, terrible protocol, terrible food on board, overall an aggravating experience. I will never be using this airline nor will I ever recommend it.

### "will avoid KLM at all costs"
Not Verified |  We booked 4 tickets with KLM because the flight times were convenient and the airplanes new and I've never flown on a 787 before, so great. Outward bound leg was cancelled 24 hours before the flight because of mechanical difficulties of the plane GRZ-AMS, so we had to go via MUC on an old 340. The return leg was also changed which we only learned upon checking in exactly 24 hours before the flight. Now we have to go with Delta on an also old 777. When we wanted to choose our seats (as soon as the online check-in was open), there were no alternatives at all and we had to sit apart from our family members or pay 120 USD per pax for premium seats. Terrible experience, will avoid KLM at all costs from now on.

### " I wish to commend all the crew"
Not Verified |  My wife and I recently (May 6, 2023) flew KLM from Split through Amsterdam to Atlanta to return home. My wife had a broken patella and a full leg cast so she could not fly economy. The flights attendants on both flights (KL 1946 & KL 621) worked to accommodate both her situation to be as comfortable as possible as well as to allow me to be fairly close to assist. I wish to commend all the crew for the assistance in this difficult situation.

### "now choose to fly with other airlines"
KLM was my preferred airline before covid, now it is consistently my worst travel experience airline! After having completed so many surveys for KLM where they wanted to know how valued and special I felt as a customer, now they seem not to care any longer at all about their customers. I used to be a flying blue gold member, almost reached platinum and now I am still a silver member. Despite this, the way KLM now treats me every time I fly with them is worse than the cheapest of the airlines. Their staff do not appear to know or understand the applicable benefits for each of their membership levels. It clearly states on the website that silver flying blue members have priority check-in, baggage drop-off and boarding. However, every single time I go to any of those lanes I am told extremely rudely that I am not allowed to use either of these services. Even when I show them the current KLM flying blue website / the KLM App that clearly states that silver members have those benefits, I am told that it no longer applies. In February 2023 KLM left us stranded in Tanzania for 24 hours due to allegedly security threats. However, when going to the official Dutch foreign ministry advice for travelling no alerts were provided for the area we were in. After I finally returned home, I filed a claim to KLM for compensation which was denied with no explanations. Then I filed a claim for reimbursement of expenses (namely 1 extra day at the hotel and 1 extra day at Schiphol long term parking) and I only received a refund for the hotel. I asked at least 25 times to KLM via all the channels they have (email, website, KLM customer service support at Schiphol airport, Messenger, flying blue phone number) why I didn’t receive a refund for the parking expenses. After 3 months I am still awaiting for a reply that will obviously never come! Incredibly rude, utterly stupid and I would expect much more from an airline such as KLM. Unless I have no other options, I now choose to fly with other airlines and I know I am not alone in this.

### "Value for money"
Flew CPH-AMS-KGL with KLM 3rd May 2023 on B737-800 and A330-200 aircrafts, respectively. Ticket bought from Ticket.com and easily handled online on KLMs homepage. Check-in online with success, but it does not reduce check-in time in Airport, so it just wastes time. Luggage checked in the whole way and delivered perfectly in Kigali. Seat choice functions well and is free to Flying Blue (elite) card holders. As both flights became almost full, I had to change my seats accordingly; eventually I got a (5 cm only) more spacious “Economy Comfort” seat which almost reassembles “Premium Economy”, which is a class higher. On the short haul I picked a declinable exit seat and had the whole row to myself. Lounges in Copenhagen (Aviator, 2 choices) and in Amsterdam (4 choices) are both nice and provide excellent breakfast. They open as early as 5 am, which made use possible. In the KLM Lounge 52 in Amsterdam, there is a new hype with their extremely popular Mimosa drink (champagne with 25% orange juice, blended, not stirred). Full catering service onboard on both flights, even the short haul to Amsterdam. FAs were good and energetic, particularly on the short haul. On the long haul, however, some cabin crew tend to patronise the passengers. Onboard supplies are quite sparse, unless one pushes. Call buttons are only answered after long time waits. Long haul rendered 2 hot meal services, but the food is not good, apart from the starters (Mediterranean Mezze). I tried both main dishes offered at lunch and they were both disappointing. They offer hot and soft drinks but also Heineken and (cheap) wines onboard; however, the red wine is somehow good (Shiraz from South Africa). I brought along my own glasses as I refrain drinking from paper mugs. Cutlery is made of wood. IFE (only longhaul) is good; bring your own headset. Conclusion: Recommended. All flights on time. Value for money. As usual, luggage was handled correct. Catering is clearly subpar compared to other legacy carriers. Big advantage to be frequent flyer, especially elite, which allow for amble seat choice and fills you up in the lounges prior to be airborne.

### "The worst experience"
The worst company that I ever used. Food is not that you expect. Rude staff. You can't take your hand luggage to board and have to check in your luggage, after that you have to spend time to receive it and hope that you receive it back. The worst experience that I ever had.

### "service I received was atrocious"
I had a horrible experience flying KLM from Houston to Amsterdam and back again. When I arrived to the check in gate in Houston I was told that I had been downgraded from Premium Comfort to Economy because of a change in aircraft and that my baggage allowance had changed. I had packed my bags the night before and then woken up early to drive 3 hours to Houston to catch the flight. Needless to say, I wasn't willing to throw any of my luggage in the trash. I told them there wasn't any way that I would have had time to re-pack my bags (now noticing that I had received an email at 3 am notifying me of the downgrade.) After much discussion I was finally permitted to take all my luggage with me. The rudeness and lack of understanding at the counter was disgusting. On the plane the staff were perfectly friendly. However, somehow in the downgrade process my meal plan had been erased. I have a severe allergy but thankfully the attendant was very kind and helpful in finding me something I could eat. On the return flight I had the opposite problem - my meal plan had resurfaced but the food I'm allergic to was very present in the dish. I notified the staff that I had an allergy and was there anything else I could possibly eat? I'm not picky, I just don't particularly want to break out in hives. She very begrudgingly searched around until she found something but she wasn't happy, saying that I had requested a specific meal. I acknowledged her, and said yes I had, but the ingredients aren't listed when I select it and - I have an allergy. For the next meal she brought me the dish again, with the food I'm allergic to, and smiled when she handed it to me. Oh joy. The smile on her face made me stare at the food in disbelief in front of me. I accepted it and just didn't eat. How could she smile like that? I had submitted a request for the refund fare difference for the first flight and it was accepted but I was told that I needed to resubmit it again after all flights are finished. I guess because they can't keep track of it for a week? The service I received was atrocious. The red tape ridiculous. But they certainly know how to train their employees on board to be friendly, serving you your food allergy and all. I guess they do not know how to problem solve, think on their feet or be courteous. They are only paid to smile.

### "leave us standing unattended"
The food in the SkyLounge at Schipol Airport was excellent. My wife was sick during the flight and the initial care was truly ugly. But, eventually, the purser came to my wife and offered genuine help, care and support. She was wonderful. I wish I knew her name because she was so special. My traveling companion uses a wheelchair. KLM said they would assist us from the Lounge to the airplane and, when we arrived at IAD, from the airplane through customs to the baggage area. Sadly, the assistance did not come. I had to somehow make my way with carry-on luggage while pushing the wheelchair. I am over 80 years old and getting wheelchair assistance was exactly why we purchased business-class tickets. When we got to the gate at Schipol, the attendants did assist us getting onto the plane. On arrival at IAD, however, we - and the other wheelchair passengers, were told to wait in the aircraft until our wheelchairs came to the door of the plane. This took close to an hour! There were not enough assistants to push all the wheelchairs. So, we were all left sitting at the gate for the plane with the passengers who were getting ready to board the plane staring at us. Finally, as a group, we told the few attendants who were assigned to us that we should proceed. We asked the assistants to help the weakest and those of us who were stronger, slowly proceeded to customs. When we got to customs, there was a separate line for wheelchairs. This line was shorter and moved more quickly than the line for able-bodied passengers. Unfortunately, our wheelchair assistants left us saying they had to go to assist other handicapped people. We all helped each other to the customs inspectors. I realize KLM is not responsible for the wheelchair assistance at IAD but they did leave us standing unattended having deposited us off the plane in plain view of the next group of passengers who were waiting to board the plane for the flight back to Amsterdam. The crew members said they were off to their hotel. The food was so disappointing. For the main meal (in business), we got stuffed shells as an appetizer. The main course selection that I made was braised beef. I was so turned off, I don't remember the dessert.

### "KLM lost our suitcases"
Traveled to Dubai for our first anniversary and KLM lost our suitcases including mine and my wife's. 48 hours after arrival still nothing so I took a cab to the airport and got no response. Worse customer service from the KLM office in Dubai as well. KlM said we could buy essentials and send them the receipt with a claim and they will refund us. We received our luggage on the day we were leaving from Dubai, which was 4 days after. It's been almost a year and They still have not refunded anything then ignore emails and whats app messages. I will never take this airline again.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  I booked my wife's birthday trip well in advance. I transferred points so we could elevate our flying experience. We also booked her best friend with us separately. I booked all 3 in premium economy together from SFO to AMS. Upon check-in (24 hours prior), the system split all 3 of us up. I had to call customer service to fix the issue. However, they were unable to sit our friend with us. We were excited about our journey so decided to just go with it. On our return flight, we were yet again split up and also downgraded. I had to spend another 3 hours on the phone trying to find solutions. No customer service reps wanted to help. I had to find the solution myself and we were still unable to get our friend with us. I was told to do the reimbursement online for the downgrade. So I did and it was rejected. More phone calls to customer service. I asked for supervisors but was told the reps do not have supervisors. No managers to assist them. I was told it was rejected because I didn't submit proof. Is information not stored at KLM? I asked for the reps email so I can send proof. Apparently reps do not have company emails so I cant email the rep now. I submitted proof and was told I would get some points back. I was given 68k points for my troubles. 68k?! Can I even book a premium economy flight for 2 for that? During this process I have spent approximately 8 hours on the phone and been "disconnected" four times without a return call. It seems KLM just ignores the customer in hopes they go away. They put all the work on the customer rather than take charge. This has been the worst customer service I have ever seen. I hope KlM provides further training for their employees.

### "experience with KLM was good"
Flew KGL-AMS-CPH with KLM 16 April 2023 on A330-200 and B737 aircrafts. Economy Lite ticket was quite cheap, bought from an OTA and easily handled online on KLMs homepage. Perks as Flying Blue gold card holder was given throughout from priority, lounge, selecting preferred seat, etc. Check-in online did not work – wasted time on several attempts. However, the check-in KGL was quick and hassle-free. Got option to select a better seat as the flight was full; I chose an exit seat, 30B, which was a real winner and one of very few seats with gorgeous leg space. Such a seat costs 300 EUR if prebooked, but was offered to me during check-in free of charge, likely due to my gold card. This seat, given to me in the last moment, saved my trip as the original seating had changed; the flight had become completely full and I about to be given a seat in a very crowded section near toilets. Access to KLMs 3rd party Pearl lounge was granted due to my Flying Blue gold card. The lounge is well supplied, but of sparse offerings. Departure from Kigali became 4 hours delayed; however, all delays were properly informed on monitors, by email, and by SMS. That caused me missing my flight in Amsterdam, but I did not stress: just went to the KLM lounge and printed out the revised BPs for the last leg to CPH, which was scheduled ambiently. Enjoyed a solid, nice breakfast in the impressive KLM “52 Lounge” in non-Schengen sector. Passport control and security check took more than an hour; not acceptable. The serious delay, arose from a wheel puncture while the aircraft stopped over in Zanzibar. It was explained in detail by flight crew and from cockpit. A new flight crew had just boarded in Kigali; they were fresh, well groomed, and well rested. Service was fine, but food provided was very little, though included a small, hot airy pizza (no alternative). The wines offered were of RSA Cape origin: The red wine (Shiraz) was good, while the Chenin Blanc white wine was undrinkable. They were served in well labelled mini-bottles which are a nice touch. The cabin crew differed tremendously in attitude, ranging from the typical, surly, patronising classic Dutch crew, to more modern and empathic types. Initially, I was not recognised as status flyer, but later they found out and provided me a full amenity kit and a Dutch ceramic mini-house as souvenir. Disembarkation in Schiphol was tedious by using busses from a remote stand. Last flight to CPH was briefly on time, and service onboard was fine. Luggage handled correctly throughout and arrived in CPH timely, despite having been rebooked and re-labelled. The experience with KLM was good. The serious delay from Africa was well handled: professional and faultless. Will fly again.

### "experience is very disappointing"
KLM has a 2x2x2 configuration in business class. This means you have to wake your neighbor up in order to use the bathroom. That doesn’t really work in business class. Moreover, the power outlets and the headphones ports are located behind your seat which makes it basically impossible to reach. As a matter of fact every time you move, your headphones are disconnected as they’re not really plugged in merely laying on a magnetic surface…. The planes are ancient and the experience is honestly very disappointing. Lots of screaming kids onboard. This didn’t feel like a business class flight at all.

### "express my heartfelt thanks"
My disabled daughter Kirsten travelled on KLM from Amsterdam to Brisbane via Singapore on 17 March (KL835) and returned on 10 April 2023 (KL836). I would just like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the wonderful KLM and Qantas ground crew and air crew who were absolutely amazing with her. They helped her constantly, from going through check-in, passport and luggage control, keeping an eye on her when she was waiting at the gates, taking photos with her on the plane and even helping her walk to the toilets on the plane. What an amazing group you all are! Not once did anything go wrong, for which I'm so very grateful. Thank you again, I really appreciate you all.

### "smooth and pleasant flight"
A smooth and pleasant flight; on time, attentive and staff that send out lots of smiles. A decent sandwich and a drink. They could improve on leg space, though.

### "did not cancel or change your flight"
On Feb 17, 2022, I had purchased six flight tickets, one for my kids and me round trips from Detroit to Jeddah via Dubai and Amsterdam, and the second one for my soon-to-be- ex-wife one way from Dubai to Detroit via Amsterdam on May 19, 2022. The purpose of the trip to save our marriage. With no prior warning or email, I found out when I wanted to check online that KLM had divided into two groups; one leaving on May 20, 2022 and one on May 18th, 2022. The one leaving on May 18, 2022, had to wait in Amsterdam for two days. I contacted KLM office and they told me that they had canceled my flights and I had to rebook or refund. The rebooking options was supposed to be free if within 30 days plus compensation of 350 Euro per traveler. When my return date was set on June 6th, I contacted KLM customer service again but another rep answered my calls. He acknowledged that I had called and was promised a free rebooking since it was within the 30 days, but he stated that he could not find us seats and recommend to contact my travel agency where I purchased my tickets from. I contacted my travel agency and he told me the found six seats available and I had to booked them and paid now otherwise, the next available flights are a week or ten days away. I called KLM customer service again and told him about it and he suggested to pay and when I go back to the States, I can submit a request for refund and compensation. After I did so and traveled back to the States and immediately filed a claim, KLM refused to honor their promise and every time came up with different excuse like 1- we did not cancel or change your flight, you did- when I gave them proof they came up with 2- you did not pay us, you paid your travel agency, get your money from them, when I told them I had spoken with KLM customer service in Dubai and he promised me that, they came up with 3- give us an evidence that you called KLM and a recorder that he promised you and we will investigate? Can you believe that

### "service is one of the best"
Not Verified | I have flown with KLM on many occasions, and I have to say their service is one of the best on my experience. I used Air France on the first leg of my flight and the service was night and day. I have to also praise the air hostess in KLM, always happy and willing to help.

### "suggest you steer clear of this airline"
First and foremost, the fact that KLM kicked us off our flight last minute is completely unacceptable. This is a blatant disregard for their customers' time and travel plans, and it's frankly inexcusable. And to make matters worse, they put us on a connecting flight on my birthday, which only added insult to injury. It's obvious that they have no regard for our personal needs or preferences. The fact that KLM Airlines can't even provide basic reliability and customer service is truly disappointing. It's difficult to imagine a more frustrating and inconvenient situation than having our travel plans disrupted at the last minute, especially when it comes to something as important as a birthday celebration. In conclusion, I would strongly advise against using KLM Airlines for any future travel needs. Their inability to deliver even the most basic level of service is a clear indication of their disregard for their customers. If you value your time and sanity, I suggest you steer clear of this airline at all costs. The reason for their rescheduling was due to them overbooking the aircraft which caused us to get kicked off and put on another flight.

### "asked for compensation for damages goods"
My bag disappeared from their internal tracking system while under their control. It was found over a week later after I called about 20 times and still took multiple days to return to me. I had to buy several articles of clothing during this time. Every attempt I have made to receive compensation for this has been extremely inconvenient. First their website wouldn’t work for filling claims. Then I got hung up on twice trying to do it on the phone after having to go through a long phone tree and being transferred to an appropriate person. A couple times the phone tree got stuck in a loop where whatever I hit would be ignored and the menu would just repeat. Then after I filled a claim they canceled it because it had not been 21 days since my baggage was lost. This was not marked on their website. Then when I filed again they canceled that because I asked for compensation for damages goods in addition to purchases, saying they aren’t responsible for the damage because they weren’t the airline that they hired to send me my stuff after I changed locations. They never addressed the purchases I made while they still had my bag. Their system is unresponsive, and frustrating. It took weeks to get any reply.

### "Very helpful airline"
Not Verified | Very helpful airline, not delayed at all. Cabin crew was nice but not talkative. Food and beverages was great. WIFI was poor. Seats clean, comfortable bathroom clean. Flight entertainment was good as well. Ground service was awesome. Definitely recommend this airline!

### "Aircrew were simply superb"
Having experienced the complete sham that Jetstar is, KLM was a welcome and pleasant reminder of what flying should be. Had minor issues with ticketing that were sorted out at the airport in BKK and then the flight was a totally different experience from the Jetstar flight 3 days earlier. Aircrew were simply superb. Attentive, caring and genuinely friendly. Food onboard was fine. Seating was quite comfortable.

### "monetary benefit was not given"
Not Verified |  KLM had promised to issue me with a flight credit for the price of my ticket for cancelled flight. After countless hours and back and forth, in the end I was given a flight credit in time. What I was given was not useable by me and efforts to request monetary benefit was not given. Extremely frustrating and won’t fly with them again after being a loyal customer for a decade. Goodbye to KLM

### "No contact possible"
Not Verified |  Direct flight was cancelled within 24 hours before departure. Alternative flight via Frankfurt was offered but almost 3 hours earlier than original and had to be at airport at 5 am. After complaining return flight was also cancelled. I do not know why. Got a refund that I did not ask for. Chat with KLM to reset return flight was refused. Had to book my own return tickets with extra costs. Pure misery, spend many hours due to faults of KLM. No contact possible.

### "pathetic service by KLM"
My flight was delayed and I waited at the airport for 6 hours and paid 200$ for a taxi and 200$ for food. All things went in vain. Moreover, I booked the flight with 1 stop at Amsterdam but Then it was changed to 2 stops adding Dubai as another stop. I booked my taxi in India and already paid him. But then I have to cancel it and book a new one. I want compensation for the same. My wife and I faced so many issues during the journey as it started on a bad note. I never expected such poor service from KLM. When I travelled from India it was like this only. This is the second time with KLM and I am facing the same issue. I must say pathetic service by KLM.

### "couldn't fault anything"
Not Verified | My friend and I flew out from Manchester on Saturday 25th March to Amsterdam with connecting flight to Copenhagen. We couldn't fault anything. Clean and tidy airplane. Polite and friendly staff. Excellent flight there and back. I've flown with KLM a few times and believe there the best. Thank you

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  The economy seats are extremely close together & the Wi-Fi did not work. My connecting flight was also cancelled without reasoning. I flew 8hrs from Chicago to Amsterdam to have my connecting flight cancelled an hour after arriving. My 7hr layover was supposed to be used for business, however, it turned into a panic experience trying to find an alternate route to my destination (Lagos, Nigeria). After going through two flight options with customer service, my 6hr connect turned into another 13hrs of flying from Amsterdam to Qatar to Lagos. Because I was in another country I wasn't to able to contact KLM via telephone, so all forms of communication had to be done via email (which was also bad due to the lack of internet connection). I ended up paying my phone carrier to make the calls to KLM. After 3 phone calls (calls kept getting disconnected), I still was not able to be compensated/accommodated for the cancelation, the missed business meeting (due to being stuck at the Amsterdam airport sorting things out), or the stress it caused. This was my first time ever flying KLM, and I promise not to ever fly with them again. I would not recommend this airline to anyone for any reason.

### "we got a drink and a pack of crisps"
Two very short hops connecting in Amsterdam. Travelling today with KLM was a breeze. Check In done through the highly efficient App. Uneventful first part from Düsseldorf to Amsterdam and a wonderful flight from AMS to CDG. On a merely 45 mins fully booked flight we got a drink (choose from tea/coffee, water, white/red wine or a chilled beer) and a pack of crisps was handed out. Lovely crews on both flights, clearly enjoying their job.

### " Horrendous experience"
We booked the new Premium Comfort Class tickets for our flight at the time of booking. However before the flight we were told that this was no longer available and we would be seated in economy. We were not even offered extra leg room or premium economy seats but put back to basic economy. I was advised that we should claim compensation for the difference in price after the journey, which I did so. KLM have since refused our claim on the basis that we used the economy seats. What else were we meant to do as we needed to fly. I just want the difference between what we paid for Premium Comfort and what we should have paid for economy back? Customer service has been zero help in resolving this, and At one point and agent tried to claim that Premium Comfort and economy are the same class! I am now having to waste more time taking this to the ADR to try and get the money I'm owed. Absolutely terrible customer service. They knew before we flew that they would not be able to offer us premium class so the refund of the difference in cost between tickets should have been ready to go for when we got back. It has put me off ever using this airline again as they seem to think they can charge what they like and not offer what you pay for. Horrendous experience.

### "value for money is not even 1"
There is one thing I don't understand about KLM: how can you loose a Business Class luggage on a direct flight? Did it fall out of the plane? Did it get sent to Mars with Elon Musk's rocket? Since I was travelling again (this time, not KLM), I took the time to walk over the Baggage Desk at Arrivals in Schiphol. What I learned is that not only did they never actually check whether it's still at the departure place, or at a stop-over place, no, they suggested I start calling airports in Zanzibar and Dar (where we landed on the way, but I did not have to leave the plane....unlike my luggage, probably)! Once again: a Business Class passenger, member of both private and corporate loyalty programs, gets their luggage lost by KLM and is advised to go look for it themselves. Fly KLM again? I don't think so. BTW, there were queues at that Lost Luggage desk, so... if you care for your property, see if there's another airline that can take you - and your luggage - to your destination. In the meantime, value for money is not even 1: it's negative. As to the rest. The first ever business class flight where I had to ask for a glass of water - twice! And I had to pay for Wifi. In business class.

### "misjudgement of choosing to fly KLM"
Whenever I have made the disastrous misjudgement of choosing to fly KLM I have regretted my very existence. First time I flew KLM, my flight was delayed by 2 hrs. Got to my destination at 11 pm. Didn't think it could get worse. Oh how wrong I was. Next time I flew KLM, my flight was delayed by 3.5 hrs. Literally was on the airport at 5 pm and got home at midnight. I could have walked from Prague and gotten to Amsterdam earlier.

### "not use this airline again"
We were booked for our return flight on February 14, 2023 from Amsterdam to Toronto and purchased Premium Economy seats. We received an email saying the aircraft had changed and the premium economy seats were not available and we were being downgraded to regular economy and we could get reimbursement for the difference. My husband’s seat was reallocated but not mine and I had to pay Euro 28.50 in order to sit beside him. After several phone calls, emails and reimbursement requests online all they refunded was Euro 28.50 for my standard seat. I’m now receiving emails saying the refund was processed and in my account. So they are refusing to reimburse me the difference between premium economy and regular economy. The return tickets cost over CAD 3,000. In addition the meal served on the plane was inedible. We will not use this airline again.

### "I wasn't happy at all"
I was traveling to Orlando from Uganda to fulfil my duties as my sister's Maid of Honor. All items for wedding I was responsible for, as well as my day-to-day items, were in my bag. I asked the check in attendant if my bag will make it to Orlando, as I had a few stops (Amsterdam, Manchester) she said absolutely. The flight attendants for KLM were not friendly. I felt uncomfortable to ask for anything such as an extra pillow/blanket for such a long flight. I finally reached Orlando, and my heart sank when my bag did not come out. Completely frustrated, took me over an hour to find out there is no KLM or Virgin Atlantic Offices at Orlando. I finally just saw virgin Atlantic flight rushing to their flight and they literally screamed "follow us! and led me to the check-in who then got me to a rep to make a claim, but over an hour looking for it, and no bag, I wasn't happy at all. Never want to experience that again. Got my bag a week later. Not ideal for someone traveling from a far. Sending in the receipts to be reimburse was not user friendly, either. Still waiting.

### "yet to get any money back"
On Nov. 11, 2022, a friend and I were booked to travel between Amsterdam and Cape Town, an 11-hour flight. As we are both women in our mid-70s, we decided to break budget and reserve business class. We did this well in advance through the Wtravel Group in Cape Town. The night before our departure, we received notice from KLM that we would not have business seats because of a change in aircraft. We went to the airport hours early to rectify this. As far as we could find out, we were the only two people on the flight who could not be accommodated in business class. Two 75-year olds! No amount of interceding could change this. They put us in Economy and offered a voucher for half the additional cost we had paid for business class, as though we would ever use this airline again. Four months later, hours and hours on KLM "customer service," many emails to the WTravel Group and we have yet to get any money back. KLM, on its website, says that a "downgrade" will be compensated, according to the miles flown, by up to 2/3 the cost of the flight. One customer service agent even suggested that since we took the flight, we weren't owed anything because it was non-refundable.

### "very disappointing and uncourteous"
My last flight from Toronto to Johannesburg was an utter disappointment. Although boarding and seating ran relatively smooth, the service on board definitely was not up to standard. The food during our flight from Toronto to Amsterdam basically inedible, the only food that I could muster was the dessert. Drinks have been reduced to only being served either wine or beer or soft drinks during our meal and during the flight. Any other requests for drinks met with a very disappointing and uncourteous flight attendant. I have never been so disappointed in flying with KLM as with this experience. I really think KLM should rethink the menus and what they offer to the passengers on an international flight in the way of beverages offered

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. Stay away from this company. I flew 4 times with them. As long you do not need their customer service you might be fine. In 3 flights I needed to change a seat/reschedule a flight (they just canceled) and getting a simple information from their customer service was impossible. Thy need a complete change on their customer service policy.

### "staff were attentive"
Morning flight from Amsterdam to Manchester, flight was slightly delayed, staff were attentive and smiling. We were just about to land into Manchester, stewardess came to my row and asked whose birthday it was, I kept quiet as I didn’t want to make a fuss, she asked again and passengers nearby were looking over. I told the stewardess, it was my birthday, she wished me happy birthday and asked if I wanted some champagne. I couldn’t refuse, and she came back with a mini bottle, 2 glasses and packet snack, it made my day.

### "Poorest customer service"
Not Verified |  Paid to book my seat. They won't let me & no one can tell me why, all I get from their CS is 'I don't know' Others are booking seats. Have spoken with no less than 10 people & they say no one can open the seat map, yet they booked my daughter and I'm linked to her ticket as her companion, but they won't book mine. I have lost out on the seat beside her because someone is booking seats, just not for me. Poorest customer service I have ever experienced.

### "Very nice airline"
Not Verified |  Very nice airline, seats were clean, comfortable ground service went well. Cabin crew was very nice. Flight on time. Amsterdam Airport was good. Food in flight was good. WiFi was ok.

### "seats in economy class are small"
I was booked with KLM for a quick work trip from Brussels to Accra and return, with no airline choice. Pre- flight / online experience and check in: positive that you can now get your boarding pass via WhatsApp, but that come with tons of advertisements of KLM paid services, similar to those of the low costs - surprising the meals for special needs/ tastes are not free: that should have been a big alarm bell: if you want to have edible food, you have to pay extra. I selected one of the few free, the vegetarian Asian, hoping the word 'asian' may guarantee some taste. I was wrong in that too. Boarding in Brussels and Amsterdam: great possibility to go through the automatic electronic passport control, which avoid long lines. KLM seats in economy class are small, making long haul flights a nightmare, airplane was shabby. I asked for a vegetarian Asian meal : got a liquid tasteless mashed potatoes with  lentils, also tasteless. In the flight from Accra, they did not bother to bring a special meal, got the vegetarian, rice with bean salad. Staff maintains basic courtesy but they disappear asap and never passed to offer drinks not in a 6 hour flight. No pillow, and earplugs are distributed only after one hour or longer that flight took off, when they are distributing food. You get your personal screen but video choice is limited to flight tracking, music and about 30 movies. Amsterdam in the non EU Arrivals zone there was just one toilet far away from the long lines for security. No available automatic passport control for EU people.

### "vegetarian meal did not have salt"
KLM collaborates with indigo for domestic transport in India. IndiGo airlines forced me to check in the cabin bag and  did not attach bag tag. The flight was delayed and baggage came 40 minutes late. I called indigo for 8 days straight and in the last they said KLM should be responsible. So, I went to KLM and they said indigo should be helping you with the claim. If you are not going to take responsibility for who you partner with then it is lack of customer service. Also, the Asian vegetarian meal did not have salt.

### "last time I will ever fly KLM"
I tried to get Accessible Assistance for the flight and approached KLM, and sent them an email to request a front row seat but this has been denied as these seats are at additional charge. Total disaster of an airline and would never travel with this shoddy airline that does not answer their phones or there are limited access to people that can assist in case of need. This is the last time I will ever fly KLM.

### "airline is not reliable"
The airline is not reliable. They cancelled our flights and offered a flight one day later with arrival time late afternoon. We had to be in Edinburgh at lunch time and therefore had to book a flight one day earlier. We had to stay one more night and they were not willing to pay for the extra hotel costs (Motel One which is not an expensive hotel at all). Whenever I can fly another airline I will avoid KLM!

### "Flights scheduled are rampantly changed"
Flights scheduled are rampantly changed without caring about the effect they have on their customers. When the customers file for compensation, they deceive them that they have paid even though the money doesn't reflect in their accounts. I was to travel on 21st August 2022 From Accra to London and they changed the date to 24th August. It was until the moment that we were to board the plane that we were told there was no plane to take us. We had to remain at the airport till about midnight when a few were taken to hotels while others had to return home.

### "highly recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Due to an error on our part we missed the connecting flight from Amsterdam to Malaga. The staff (Suzanne) at The airport was excellent. She made sure we got to our destination, booked a hotel for us for the night, and made sure that our flights home were not affected. Thank you Suzanne for all you help. We have flown on KLM on a few occasions and the service has always been good. We would highly recommend this airline.

### "choosing KLM was the biggest regret"
We fly frequently on long haul flights to Brazil and choosing KLM was the biggest regret. The seats are horrible, we paid for an upgrade which wasn’t worth it a single bit. The food on board is tasteless, a block of hard cheese on bread is one of the meals. We paid extra also for our baggage and when we have arrived into Dublin and our luggage is lost. Both of our cases are gone. My wife is pregnant and tried to use another toilet but the staff yelled at her to go to another toilet even thought the line was very long. I’ll never and I repeat never fly on this terrible airline ever again.

### "Will not travel with KLM again"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever. My luggage was not sent with me. when I arrive at the airport, I am promised that the luggage will be delivered the next day. The next day I get a message that it will be delayed. I call and call, talk to five different customer service people. are promised that they will send it the same day and that they will call back. No one calls me back, no further message or information. Will not travel with KLM again, or recommend KLM to anyone again.

### "first and last time flying this airline"
This is our first time flying KLM and to say that the customer service they provide is fair would be a compliment. KLM made no notification to our flight delay and possibly canceled flight because we are still waiting at the airport. There was no announcement, email, text etc. Technology is advanced enough where we all get notifications of delays on app or the minimum at airport. KLM didn’t deliver on either front. This is our first and last time flying this airline, there’s more reliable options out there .

### "had a terrible experience"
The food options finished before they could get to us. They had no options except vegetarian. My 19 month old had no options to choose from on the plane. They served ice cream for dinner for kids and pasta throughout. Pasta dishes and salads. Nothing else. The flight attendants had mixed messages about the use of bassinets. My bag arrived 3 days later. We had a terrible experience.

### "experience was disappointing"
I flew KLM from Delhi to Amsterdam and have to say the experience was disappointing. I have no idea how it is rated a four star airline. We departed on time at 3am. The staff in India were not friendly. The seats are rather uncomfortable. My audio wasn’t working properly. No pillows are provided despite it being a 10 hour night flight. The service starts with only a hot pocket and drink. No alcohol on board the flight for economy class. The cups are extremely small as well. Portion isn’t good. About 2 hrs prior to landing, we got the breakfast meal. It consisted of a watery paneer with paratha. The yogurt tasted sour and they didn’t have proper chai. There is no Hindi speaker on board the flight either. Staff are okay but they really need to improve the quality and quantity of food on board for india. This was worst than flying United from Delhi to Newark.

### "used to be an excellent airline"
KLM used to be an excellent airline. Last September we flew Toulouse France to Vancouver with change of planes in Amsterdam. When checking in online, about 18 hours before flight time, I found that the first leg of the flight had been rescheduled to a later time so that we could not make the connection to Vancouver. KLM had never contacted me about this change. I phoned KLM and our Toulouse flight was changed to an early morning departure, so that we could make the connection. This necessitated leaving a family get together and extra charges for an airport hotel, and taxi. I claimed those expenses from KLM. After over three months, KLM replied, saying that as I had booked online on the KLM website, KLM had no obligation to notify me, but I had an obligation to keep checking for changes in the schedule. So it was my fault and I was entitled to no compensation. Every other airline I know, even low cost ones, never fails to email customers about schedule changes. So KLM had the gall to blame the victim, me, for their poor service.

### "service was impeccable"
My flight in November from SCL to AMS was one of my best flights. The plane was rather new and well maintained. But the best part of the flight was the crew. Polite but chatty and made everybody feel welcome on board. The service was impeccable and nothing was too much for them. Wines, Champagne and food were extraordinary.

### "I will be avoiding KLM"
After this latest experience I will be avoiding KLM. When I checked in online on September 10th for KL678 from Calgary to Amsterdam, I was offered and I accepted and paid for an upgrade from Comfort to Business Class, at a cost of $1134.28 Cdn. When I checked in at the KLM counter the next day I was told I was bumped from BC to accommodate a crew member who was returning  to Amsterdam. Even though I was civil and courteous I was moved to row 43, at the back of the airplane, because my Economy Comfort seat was not available. When I asked for a refund at the counter, the agent said I had to do that online and it would not be a problem. She wrote down the KLM refund website link. After I returned from my 3 week trip, I submitted to KLM the refund request. One month later I received a one sentence email declining my request, without reasons. I appealed the decision and no response from KLM 4 months later. I have since learned from various customer feedback sites that KLM has done this to 100's of passengers.

### "They lost my luggage"
Lost Luggage I booked a flight from Shanghai, China, to Toronto, Canada. The flight/booking went to Amsterdam, then Mexico CIty, then to Toronto. I flew KLM to Amsterdam and then Mexico City. The flights themselves were alright, and I'd even like compliment their flight staff. Upon arriving in Mexico City it was apparent my luggage never made it. I have no reason to believe Mexico City airport lost it as everyone else's luggage was there, although Mexico City airport was exceptionally unhelpful, but that's another story. Afterwards I contacted KLM customer service, and despite all evidence supporting they lost it as it never made it to Mexico, they said I had to file the lost luggae claim through aeromexico as they were the last flight of the booking and there's nothing they can do. Aeromexico said they won't and to contact KLM. Now to be clear aeromexico was even more unhelpful as they sent me from customer service rep to customer service rep, finally saying I have to email, which I have yet to get a response from. However, as bad as they are, they didn't lose my luggge. KLM clearly did, and so I have 2 airlines telling me to contact the other one, when it's very obvious which one lost one, but in the end KLM's response is "due to regulations" they can't trace my luggage that they lost and I'm essentially out of luck. Essentially "Yea we lost your luggage but we can't technically help you. Regulations or not, I can't say that's satisfactory customer service. I paid for the flight, gave them luggage trusting them to deliver it. They did not. They lost my luggage, and are doing nothing about it. That's it.

### "I will not recommend it"
I was happy with KLM but my experience with this airline today wasn’t good, I wasn’t impacted at all. We were assigned to zone 5 even though we paid for seat and we’re seated 10 but we were told not enough space for carry on without any apologies and staff at gate were not nice or polite. My understanding was there were choose people base on how much they paid. I never had this kind of experience so I will not travel with this airline and I will not recommend it.

### "really poor service level by KLM"
Working as an expat in Malaysia, KLM offers the most convenient flight route between Kuala Lumpur and Stavanger, Norway via Amsterdam. Booking flight tickets is an easy and straight forward matter, the same can not be told when it comes to selecting seating for the flights. I am a frequent traveler and a father of four wonderful children. I have been travelling with infant numerous times between Europe and South America (KLM, Brasil) and between Europe and Asia (Scandinavian Airlines, Thai Airways, Lufthansa), and it has never been a problem getting an infant bassinet - until now. When purchasing the tickets, I always follow up by talking with a real human to ensure my request for an infant bassinet is registered in the booking. I then repeat the request upon check-in as soon as it opens (typically a day before departure, depending on destination). KLM has not delivered on our 3 last intercontinental flights, leaving us with an infant on our laps for 14 hour flights. All the while, we can see the seats where infant bassinets can be utilized are occupied with passengers not travelling with infants. Children grow quickly, and I doubt we will have more children. As such, this is a temporary problem for us. Regardless, I think it is really poor service level by KLM not to make an effort to facilitate infant bassinet requests better than what they have demonstrated on our last 3 intercontinental flights.

### "really unacceptable"
Flight on 18 August 2022 was cancelled as a result of technical problems. Various challenges to find a new flight. Flew on 19 August 2022 to Cape town. Luggage was reported as lost on 19 August 2022. All procedures followed. Various communicate used to contact KLM: WhatsApp, messenger, emails and telephonic calls. It is more than 4 months no compensation received not even for emergency purchases (all receipts were scanned and mailed). Promises of customer care call back not met. This is really unacceptable and KLM will not be used in future or recommended.

### "a disappointing experience"
Travelling with KLM again was a disappointing experience from the ground to the gate. Our luggage was missing from their codeshare airline from Sevilla to Amsterdam. We are currently back home with no news on our luggage. Secondly on our departure, we wanted to clarify on our seats but was shut off on our request at the gate. Upon reaching the gate, the staff simply waved off with a full flight without listening to us and constantly cutting us in our sentence. We were even told that there is no need to listen to our long story. The boarding was also messy with no clear instructions on luggage to be put on hold. On board, I was questioned why did I not prepare food for my baby when I had ordered for infant food during booking of the flight. It was an awful start to end and start our year with KLM.

### "the worst airline food"
Cabin crew service was excellent. However, the food was mostly terrible. Some indiscernible brown mushy substance was hidden below lettuce in the salad. The chicken option was mostly rice, with a few small bits of chicken mixed in. Later in the flight, a warm pastry was service -  mostly a thick soggy dough with some trace of a bland, unrecognizable and unappetizing substance inside. The food on my earlier Vancouver to Amsterdam flight was okay, but this food on the Amsterdam to Vancouver was certainly the worst airline food I've ever experienced. Even a fresh fruit cup, a bit of yogurt etc would be a great improvement.

### "informed that one of our luggage was lost"
Not Verified |  This was our first time flying with KLM. We had not been able to visit our family for 4 year due to covid and other circumstances, so this was a very important trip for us. Went we reached Austin we were informed that one of our luggage was lost. This was the luggage that had all of our Christmas gifts for our family as well as very important personal items. After submitting a report, we were told by KLM that our luggage would arrive the next day to Austin. It has now been 5 days and tomorrow is Christmas eve, and everyday we called to ask about the status of our luggage and everyday we are told different things. This is absolutely unacceptable. We have zero confidence that we will get the luggage, much less in time for Christmas, and - having lost all of our gifts- our Christmas is ruined. I submitted a request for compensation which has been promptly dismissed by an email claiming long delays in processing (I.e. we will get nothing). Never flying with KLM again.

### "flight attendants all went above and beyond"
I don't usually review airlines, but I actually had such a great experience with KLM that I decided to leave them an honest review, especially considering that, lately, airlines have been getting such a bad rep. The flight attendants all went above and beyond during our flight from Copenhagen to Amsterdam, as they were friendly and very accomodating. My partner and I mentioned in the beginning of the flight that it was our honeymoon and they gave us a little treat at the end of the flight. The comfort was great and the food provided was pretty good considering it was all inclusive. All in all, a great flight!

### "Low quality airline"
Low quality airline, always delayed, small seats, no communication about delays. Takes up to 8 months to get a voucher after a delay.

### "worst experience I have had"
In 40 years of air travel, the worst experience I have had! They lost our luggage and we had to track the luggage (have apple tags!). They would not get our luggage to us days later so we had to take a 2 hour train to get it. The baggage line on the return flight at London City airport was so long. The staff are rude and yelling at passengers. Never again. The Spirit airlines of the Europe.

### "they have no customer service to assist you"
Worst airline to fly with. I had two travels with them and both of them were not on time. I am not allowed to bring my trolley with me on board even if I paid extra for it just because they are not able to organise the cabin otherwise. Now due to my delay of 45 minutes for no important reason there is a good chance of me not getting my trolley in Düsseldorf tonight. Which means that after having to wait 1 hour waiting for my trolley to confirm that it didn’t arrived I will have to fill a missing form because they have no customer service to assist you. I will be flying again on Monday for work and all my work material is in my trolley so I wouldn’t recommend KLM.

### "not received my promised compensation"
I travelled with KLM to attend a family wedding in Dubrovnik in July and while the in-flight experience was pleasant, I experienced two issues afterword. First there was some serious damage done to my luggage and second was a missed connection on my way home. In both cases the airline advised to make a claim via their online portal for it to be handled. For the damaged luggage I filed a claim on 13-Jul-2022 and was finally resolved on 20-Oct-2022 with a fair offer for compensation. Unfortunately, it has now been over a month and a half and I have not received my promised compensation. There has also been no further information provided or response to my inquiries. For the second issue, this was filed on 25-Jul-2022 as a result of a flight disruption at Schiphol Airport. This was due to ridiculously long security lines which caused me to miss my connecting flight despite having arrived several hours in advance. After much back and forth, I was advised on 22-Nov-2022 that my claim was denied despite following all the correct procedures and providing all the required evidence. There has been no response to my objection to date. It has been a terrible experience trying to followup on these issues or get someone in authority on the phone but I tried again today by calling 800-618-0101 and was advised that my cases will be re-investigated and a response provided in nine days. I hope this gets resolved soon but I am not holding my breath.

### "I cannot stress how bad they are"
I live in Amsterdam so this airline is unavoidable. My advise to anyone traveling - avoid KLM like the pest - seats are tiny - always filled to the brim and it’s always overpriced. Like everything ‘Koninklijke’ is usually also late because of bad planning. I cannot stress how bad they are.

### "An excellent trip"
An excellent trip. On time departure from LHR then 3 hours in the lounge at Schiphol. We boarded on time but took off 90 minutes late due to delays loading the aircraft. Onboard, the seats are great, roomy and comfy. The IFE has more than enough choices for a 12 hour flight and even a free WiFi connection for a limited time. The food was very tasty, some of the best I’ve had in the air. Finally the crew were excellent, efficient while still being amicable and chatty. After taking off 90 minutes late we were only about 20 minutes late arriving in Lima.

### "better than US carriers generally"
Boarding wasn't particularly efficient at AMS. However, aircraft was very clean, had a nice, new KLM magazine to read, and the staff were friendly and professional. Seat was a bit cramped, and there was no in-flight entertainment. Water and little snacks were distributed. Unremarkable, but positively so. I've always had positive overall experiences flying with KLM, although I wouldn't have wanted to be so cramped if I'd flown trans-Atlantic instead to just Bucharest. Still better than US carriers generally.

### "both times they have cancelled my flight"
Flight was cancelled due to an accident the day before, I was automatically rebooked to a flight 6 days later with two long layovers. After much complaining I was eventually offered a flight that is "only" 4 days late, still with two long layovers. I accepted the offer, got no response or confirmation, and when I did get a response that offer was gone. I said anywhere in the right country works if it will get me home sooner and quicker and showed multiple screenshots of the tickets for better flights they still had available for purchase on their website (for four times the price of my original return ticket of course). They denied that those were actually available and eventually offered me the same two and a half day journey arriving four days late but to a different city this time. I have only flown KLM twice, and both times they have cancelled my flight home and I have spent hours trying to get a solution out of their support. I am still stuck in a different country so can't comment on the claims process yet, but based on my other interactions with the company I'm sure I will be stuck with the bill.

### "refuse to upgrade us to business class"
There was an accident at Lima airport. A problem that wasn't from the responsibility of KLM nor the passengers. But big company KLM can not afford to lose some pennies, only the passengers can lose their money and time. To rebook the flight the options they offer were only in 8 days. And they only give us 1 night stay at an hotel. We were sent from call center to support desk at the airport (not available for 24h, only after 3-5 pm) and back. You have to constantly insist on an earlier flight. They give you a new flight and than reebook it again to a later date. They keep offering the bare minimum with the least effort, hoping we settle for it. Sending people around from on place to another, waiting long hours at the airport, so that we get tired and agree to pay just to resolve the situation. And then all the seats magically appear. They refuse to upgrade us to business class. It's always about the money, customer well-being is never a priority. I understand that an accident is out of everyone control, but then everyone should lose something (airline and passengers). They don't care about us. If you can, choose another airline.

### "I’m definitely disappointed"
As a platinum member, loyal customer of KLM, I’m definitely disappointed. My seat was discussing dirty, not cleaned at all from previous passenger. Entertainment system not working. The cabin crew was extremely arrogant, unfriendly, unprofessional and actually I’ve got a feeling that they hate their job. When I’ve mentioned all this the purser was trying to convince me that this might be my impression only. He even didn’t apologise for their behaviour. Will never fly with this airline.

### "crew are extremely friendly"
The departure from Brussels was on time and this short flight is interesting to me, because we fly a little along the sea and the view when landing in Amsterdam is wonderful. The next flight to Belgrade was a little late, but I didn't bother. The flight itself was very peaceful and since it was an evening flight, it was quite quiet in the cabin. Shortly before landing, the captain informed us that we would have a short landing. And indeed when we landed, we stopped pretty quickly. The crew are extremely friendly.

### "KLM refuses to compensate me"
Worst airline experience ever. I was on a business trip in Spain. On Jun 28, 2022, I was scheduled to fly KL2648 from Malaga to Amsterdam, and then to LA, with a couple of hours layover. 4 days prior to my flight, I received an email from KLM saying my flight was canceled. They then scheduled me to a different flight a day early (and at a different time). I couldn’t leave a day early, due to my business obligations, so I spent hours each day trying to reach the airline. However, KLM's customer service was not reachable and the website wasn't functioning. On the top of all of that, I kept receiving confusing emails from KLM saying my original flight was still on time, while, at the same time that flight had changed. So I had to go to the airport one day prior to my original flight to find out if my trip actually changed or not. Upon arriving at the airport, I was told by a rude KLM employee that I must fly now or I will lose my ticket. I was also promised that I will be taken care of by a KLM employees in Amsterdam. I arrived at the Amsterdam airport after 1am, and there were no KLM employees there at all. I then had to spend a frustrating night looking for a place to stay because all the hotels were fully booked. KLM does not care about their passengers, and they don't take any responsibility when there’s a problem for which they are responsible. It's been 5 months now that I have been trying to get a refund for my reasonable expenses (as they promise to pay), but KLM refuses to compensate me, even though I have proof for every transaction. Do yourself a favor, save yourself money, time and emotional stress, and DO NOT fly KLM. Almost any other airline will respect you better!

### "Will choose a different airline next time"
Not Verified |  Cramped seats even in Economy Comfort for 100€ more is a joke! Plane in bad condition. Electricity at seat not working, WiFi not working, Map air show not working. Will choose a different airline next time.

### "I like the airline and the crew are great"
Used KLM between Heathrow & Amsterdam and return, check in for both outbound and return was pretty simple as I only had hand baggage. Although at 7.00am terminal 3 was very busy. The flight departed from gate 3A a long queue so ended with the flight being delayed a little, once onboard seat 6A was fine for this short 50 min flight. Departed a little late but landed just 10 min late, service and crew were really very nice be boarded quickly, in to a packed out Schiphol. Returning the following day security and passport control took around 1 hour which is okay, arrived at the gate D12 where boarding started 20 min before departure, a full flight once again 6A and again crew and service just great. Arrived on time at LHR to a remote stand and bussed to the terminal. Nice trip although I'm still not sure if I would use KLM Economy for long haul flights, might try business if the cost is right! I like the airline and the crew are great.

### "Business class long haul with KLM is a treat"
Business class long haul with KLM is a treat. Great chef food served by wonderful and attentive staff. Perhaps some background to some of the bad reviews is in order. Many of these bad reviews are about KLM customer care and Schiphol airport handling. During the pandemic, Schiphol in its infinite wisdom thought it wise to lay off much of the security personnel even when the Dutch government provided for subsidies for companies not to fire employees. Equally with the baggage handling companies, whose personnel is not well paid unfortunately anyway. Now with air traffic resuming to pre-pandemic levels, that same personnel is impossible to come by. Of course they have found more reliable employers as there is a general labour shortage anyway. As a result and to be fair, KLM is caught in the middle. KLM has had to drastically cut back on flights and occupancy, in a time where it was hoping to make up lost revenue during the pandemic. Customer service is therefore swamped in claims, while staff there too is undoubtedly in short supply. This is sad to see because the on board service is excellent and the seats in business class are good and can recline fully.

### "did not communicate this change to me"
KLM cancelled my original flight. They rebooked me on an earlier flight. They did not communicate this change to me. As a result, I had to be rebooked arriving a day and a half later. UK law obligates them to a partial refund, but they are denying the request saying I was a no show, not acknowledging that the flight was missed du to their itinerary change and lack of communication. I've never missed a flight in my entire life for reasons I could control, and fly at least an average of once a month, with yearly international travel. This is disappointing, frustrating, and poor business practice combined with worse customer service.

### "Worst flight ever"
Not Verified |  Worst flight ever. We have a 1 year baby with us and they took his pram, and promised us giving it back in Amsterdam. It did not happen and they did not care about us at all. After now contacting customer service, they told us they can not do anything because we «already took the flight».

### "definite decline in the service"
Not Verified |  
Coming back from Europe on KLM was not pleasant, after a lovely holiday. I've happily flown KLM Economy many times in the past, but there is a definite decline in the service offered now! The one thing I will say is that there was good leg room and I am 5'7" tall, so that was a positive. they do not carry any pillows now for Economy passengers. You do get the see through blanket and a bottle of water. Meals: first meal of dinner was fairly tasty, a chicken curry. However, they offered bread rolls, and when I told the cabin crew that I had no butter on my tray, she said that they found out about a month before that butter had been deleted from meal trays .. they only knew because so many passengers were asking for it! Dessert was handed out later, a tasteless yellow cake in a plastic wrap. The cutlery is now made of flat balsa-like wood, stamped into shapes of knife, fork and spoon. Like eating with hospital tongue depressors. The second meal was unidentifiable .. a boiling hot piece of a pizza like sandwich with no discernable filling, and a sloppy salad, beige and liquid with nothing really to tell what it was. The staff were delightful, but these little "economies" by KLM have put me off flying with them ever again. Sorry, KLM...you're off my list.

### "do not feel that they value their customers"
Booked these flights months in advance. From Edmonton to Athens with a layover in Amsterdam in order to catch our flight to Egypt to meet our tour group. KLM changed our flight times without even notifying us (this is not acceptable), we happened to look ourselves and realized that 3 weeks prior to our departure date we would not be able to make any of our connections (panic!) My travel partner spent hours on the phone with KLM sine I was working - she would be put on hold 15 minutes at a time by the agent who was nothing but rude and unhelpful and she was told vague different reasons for the flight changes from different employees. It seemed like they were trying to get rid of us or it was a hassle to assist us. KLM offered to place us on new flights that were not reasonable and eventually after hours agreed there were no reasonable flights and would refund us our tickets. We then had to rebook our flights which cost more as we were now only 3 weeks away from leaving and took us on a completely different flight path. This caused us to have to cancel hotels and re-book others. On top of this we were informed our refund of about $1400 would take 3-5 MONTHS! I understand these things happen, but I believe we should have had better communication and assistance. They also changed our flights coming home as well and I had to take another day off work, but I'm not even focusing on that. Based on what I have read in the air passenger protection regulations I do not think they abided by code. I have lost all confidence in this airline and do not feel that they value their customers.

### "totally forgotten about their customers"
Poor impersonal service in economy class, far from what KLM wants its potential clients to believe with their marketing campaigns, delivering a excellent service and life long loyalty, we fly together, you feel at home with us etc., etc. I had the pleasure of spending 10 hours with KLM. The seat in economy comfort, ample leg room, but horrible comfort after 6 hrs. you do not know how to sit comfortable. Just after the start you get bottle of Spa water with a small package containing a small tissue to clean your hands, it is the only one you get during the flight. Thereafter you have to wait 1-1,5 hrs. to get your 'exquisite' dinner, a choice between vegetarian or chicken, this is served with a large basket which seems to be a salad, all served on a tray with non-slippery top side, which tends to move over your seat table as no anti-slip is installed under tray. so you have risk that your complete meal including beverage ends up in your lap, Regarding the taste of the food served, the chicken meal is neutral/ ok, but not very tasteful, the salad which seems to be a highflyer by KLM, is too awful to further describe, it tastes horrible, KLM should be ashamed to serve this to customers. the piece of bread which comes with dinner is though and hardly eatable, the piece of cheese sticks to its plastic packaging. The 'exquisite' dinner is served with one beverage, no further beverage service during or afterwards. After dinner you wait another 45 mins to get coffee and the famous cake, which KLM is proud to serve. This cake is very very sweet and again without any taste, except the sweet, overall it is just a tasteless piece of cake. After the coffee, you have to wait couple of hours for any further service is provided, This time a hump of bread served which seems to be cheese and some kind of sauce and a bottle of water, no other choice of beverage. The bread again is tasteless! Just short before landing the last service is done, again the famous tray with anti-slip topside, but no anti-slip underneath the tray, so large risk that the content of tray and your beverage will end up in your lap. This serving is a hump of dough with some cheese and sauce, which KLM calls a pizza snack, the dough, sorry pizza, is so tough it is difficult to swallow. Again some kind of salad is served, again tasteless and some kind of dessert, which turns out to be cream with some cookie crunches and caramel sauce. With all the food being served no salt and pepper is provided, also no hygiene tissues are provided. No announcement is being made that in case you require additional beverage and/or snack you can go to one of the galleys Summarizing the food and service on this KLM flight was horrible and it is a full disgrace what they are offering for food. KLM was once solid consistent quality performing airline, but now they are completely lost, no more focus on the customer who pays top dollar to fly KLM, instead they focus on social community aspects. Management or whoever is in charge of cabin / inflight service have totally forgotten about their customers and/or try to force them into sustainable, vegan, vegetarian options which might be high on the agenda of KLM, but not always high on the agenda of their paying customers. Although it is not easy to say, this KLM and its service is far from the KLM it once was. If you have an option to fly with other airline please do so, otherwise bring your own food and beverage,.

### "dishonest in their luggage fees"
KLM charged me $625 for 3 medium-size suitcases and 1 mid-size bag. None of the luggage pieces were over weight. The charge of 625 for normal luggage is outrageous! It was 62.5% of the cost of my ticket. I tried to speak with the airport rep to resolve this charge, but it was unsuccessful. They are dishonest in their luggage fees. The rep charged me quietly without telling me about it.

### "I tried to get the money back"
I had booked a flight and also booked seats, since this was a long one. The seats were only available at additional costs (50 or 60 euros in total). However, the whole flight was disrupted and the airline informed us that both the outbound and the return flight would be at a different time. This was a hard thing, but I understand that some changes are unavoidable. So I booked new seats again, since flights and aircrafts were not the same as before. It was difficult to have changes with more than 6 hours, but well, this happens. However, what I do not understand is: What happened to my money spent for booking the initial seats? Of course I tried to get the money back ("refunds"), and I invite everyone who is reading this to try and see what happens when you try to get your money back: nothing. You are directed to an online form which is literally impossible to complete - as, for example, you must find out your EMD number, and I can only wish you good luck for this. In short, I assure you, you will never succeed. The information asked from you is so complicated that you will never find out what they want from you. And so you end up having paid your seats twice, period. Do you think you can take my money for booked seats, then change flights, and simply take the money again for the new seats, and keep all the money?

### "Worst service ever"
Worst service ever. Cancelled my flight, but couldn't be bothered to email us beforehand. Didn't find out until we tried to check in. 2 hours and counting, still on hold with both social media and the telephone. Got hung up on twice by telephone. No answer at all on social media. Not sure how we're going to fix this before our flight tomorrow (theoretically). Might try calling multiple lines, my travel agent (who already couldn't help me), and still trying. Is it really that hard to answer a phone call or maybe (gasp) proactively realize that you just screwed 300 people in their travel plans?

### "really are the worst airline"
I have made literally hundreds of international flights, KLM really are the worst airline I’ve ever encountered. Their delays made me miss my connection (also KLM) flight. They didn’t ever get me to my final destination of Houston, instead leaving me stranded In Austin. They promised 600 Euro compensation and yet still haven’t paid if 6 Months later despite the claim being filed in April. On top of they, the service was non existent, the food bordering on inedible. So, don’t be tempted to book with them, if you, well you have been warned!

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service. I had two major concern with the KLM team. My luggage was damaged during the trip. the customer service did not provide any resolution or compensation! My booking was including a bus from Montreal airport to Ottawa; however, no bus was provided and KLM team were not helpful at all

### "Please do not Use KLM"
Checked luggage in LHR. Holiday of lifetime to Galapagos. My travel firm Exodus changed flights due to unreliability with KLM and connections. LHR to Amsterdam okay, Amsterdam to Panama 2hr flight delay before leaving. Service on plane terrible. Kept missing our row out for meals. Then had no food left for us! At Panama another 1+ hour flight delay. We Arrived Quito later than scheduled My luggage did not arrive. Told by Quito staff it was still in Amsterdam. They informed KLM. Day3 still no luggage. Told KLM not answering calls. Leave for Galapagos today My birthday on 26th cards/gifts are in mu case. No holiday gear either. Please do not Use KLM. I have to fly back with them and I am dreading it

### "we got random seats"
The flight to Brazil was ok, but from Brazil it is a real circus. KLM changed aircraft a few hours before departure of course without informing about it. Unfortunately, in the previous plane we had a reserved seat with a cot for a baby. In the plane that was swapped we got random seats, unfortunately with a very busy baby, sitting with two other people, not having a free seat next to it, is a chore. I had to keep the trays with food on my table because the wife was holding the baby and it was impossible to eat both at the same time, when I returned my tray faster so that my wife could eat, I heard a comment from the flight attendant that you all have problems with your children. KLM, if you change seats a few hours before departure, give at least one free seat to the family with a child. Especially since you took a place with a cot that had a lot of space. Giving the reason that the plane was not full and we had to change to a smaller one. Eating also on the return flight is a massacre, free snacks were terrible on the flight to Brazil, although there was free cola beer or sandwiches on the return flight, only very bad cakes and water. Also in the plane there was so little space that as the flight attendant was going with the cart, you had to stand by and wait for it to finish so that you could get enough to the toilet, which created gigantic queues to the toilet.

### "I will not travel with KLM again"
Food was mediocre. Seats were so small that I stood most of the trip to permit the lady next to me to get some rest. Sound system was bad so you couldn't listen watch a movie. Staff were very good but impotent to solve such issues. When I tried to lodge a complaint on their website, the system freezes at the very moment I make the choice in the type of complaints. After several attempts I gave up. I will not travel with KLM again as I expected that the Nederland reputation for quality would also permeate KLM.

### "Not a good customer service"
I flew from KLM and my route was (YQR-YYC-PRG-AMS-JED*--*JED-AMS-YYZ-YQR). While coming back from AMS, aeroplane stood idle at AMS airport for more than 1 hour and when i landed Toronto (YYZ) I missed my connecting flight from YYZ-YQR. KLM provided me next day flight for Air Canada (ticked attached) and they took me to the hotel (Marriott Toronto airport) where they charged CAD 50 from each passenger saying that its a hold and you will get your money back. Now next day when I went to the airport for my Air Canada flight they charged me CAD113 dollars saying that KLM has not paid for your luggage. I never get my CAD50 back from the hotel which they said that was just a hold money. Not a good customer service and terrible food

### "It’s impossible to complain on KLM"
Had 3 flights cancelled. 1) First they rebooked my flight Madrid-Amsterdam from 12.50pm to 06.00am, KL 1698. This flight was cancelled as well. 2) Then they offered me a flight to Amsterdam with three legs: Madrid-Bilbao UX 7157, Bilbao-Paris AF 1477 and Paris-Amsterdam KL1244. 3) In Bilbao, I received a message from KLM the flight KL1244 was cancelled and rebooked to the same flight but next day, on Sunday. 4) When I arrived in Paris, my luggage was lost. After some arguments at the counter, they rebooked again: flight KL 1246 on Saturday. 5) The flight delayed. I arrived in Amsterdam near midnight without my luggage. 6) I'm 68 years old. I was tired, I spent the last two days (Sunday and Monday) in Amsterdam going shopping because I didn't have clothes, underwear, toothpaste, etc. I bought a hand luggage and came back to Brazil on Tuesday (20 of September). The last days of my trip, from 15 to 20 of September, were ruined. 7) They sent me back my lost luggage on 26 of September. Thank you. Other details of the flight - 1) The first time they rebooked my flight KL 1702 to KL 1698, I am sure they could offer me other options. 2) At the airport of Madrid when they rebooked of the second time my flight. KL 1698 to a three leg flight to Amsterdam they offered me the worst option, because they knew that in Paris there was a pilots' strike. 3) Yet, at the airport of Madrid, I was the last person or one of the last person to be assisted by the staff of KLM. I am 68 years old. 4) At the counter of Air France in CDG Paris, the employee told me that I was to blame for my suitcase being lost, she didn't want to find me a hotel, and it was with much discussion that I managed to get her to give me another flight. 5) It’s impossible to complain on KLM. You are always chatting with a robot. 6) Because my luggage was lost, I spent more than 300 euros in less expensive items, and they refund me less than 200 euros. Five days of my trip were ruined.

### "Pretty bad customer service"
Pretty bad customer service by KLM Customer Service at New Delhi Airport. Would not take KLM again if possible. I used Turkish and Qatar Airways in recent past and experience with them was amazing - not so with KLM staff. They should be fired. Customer supervisors are not better either. They do not know customer service.

### "poor comfort"
Smooth boarding, poor comfort (3 seats in the row like in Economy, with the one in the middle left empty). Catering was ok, according to the short-haul flight. Staff was nice and helpful with information about connecting flight.

### "Excellent service"
Excellent service, nice staff, Good meal and reasonable choice of wines and other alcoholic beverages. The flight was delayed but recovered en-route and arrived on-time. The seat was comfortable, 180 degrees reclining, could sleep well. Entertainment screen with recently released movies. Very happy with KLM!

### "disgrace for an airline"
Not Verified | I was booked to fly from Glasgow to Zurich via Amsterdam on 17th November. The other day, they changed my flight times for both flights. Tonight they have emailed me saying my Amsterdam to Zurich is cancelled and no alternative offered yet. A disgrace for an airline

### "I was quite positively surprised"
I flew with KLM for the first time and I admit that I was quite positively surprised. Everything was fine, the planes were great, the crews were wonderful. I didn't mind the delay in leaving Brussels as I had plenty of time in Amsterdam for the next flight to my final destination. However, on the flight from Brussels to Amsterdam, I experienced a very unpleasant situation from one of the flight attendants. The passenger sitting behind me was listening to a program very loudly on her phone. The gentleman next to me reminded her to stop as it was annoying. This passenger then told the flight attendant that we had both said something to her, false accusations. The flight attendant immediately took her side and literally accused us. The passenger was rewarded by moving to better seats. I will never forget that look from the flight attendant. She did not allow me to explain to her personally what had happened, but rather let it be known that I should be quiet. She did not say this with words, but with a look. Regarding the second part of the journey from Amsterdam to Belgrade, only praise. The crew is wonderful and I was most pleased that they served food and various drinks. You don't get to experience that almost anywhere anymore. KLM has nice planes, clean and their purchase and check-in system is passenger friendly.

### "made the flight so comfortable"
Not Verified |  The crew on our flight on the 7th October, can only be described as superb, nothing was to much trouble. They made the flight so comfortable for all our family.

### "canceled my flight 2 times for 3 days"
Very bad service and they canceled my flight 2 times for 3 days, the next day at the destination I was going I had to take another flight so I had to pay another flight to get there and they only returned 100 euros. They did not pay me a hotel, no food or anything. I will never fly with KLM again.

### "worst I've ever experienced"
The customer service at this airline is the worst I've ever experienced. First, they lost my luggage in June in Amsterdam and I didn't get it back for a month (and I was very patient because I knew they had major problems going on with luggage at that time), and had no clothes etc for my entire vacation except the very few things I bought (one outfit - thank God I was in an apartment and could wash clothes). No thanks to them because they wouldn't respond to anything - no emails, no calls, nothing. And now it's 2 days before October and I haven't seen any compensation whatsoever. A customer service rep contacted me finally in early September and ended up only approving $100 euros for my month of misery, even though my suitcase was totally destroyed by the time it got back .. but they say it is still functional. I wouldn't even give it away - it is trash. I have yet to see the 100 euros and she won't even answer my emails. I also did not get my baggage fee reimbursed and the rep won't even answer my questions about it! I've been flying for 50+ years and never had a nightmare like this. Then I went again to Edinburgh ... had to take KLM to Amsterdam on the way back and KLM LOST MY LUGGAGE AGAIN (with the new suitcase I had to purchase since my other one had a hole in it and it looked like someone had taken a meat cleaver to it)!! The ticket agent failed to direct our luggage past Amsterdam even though she knew I was going all the way to New Mexico.

### "service and charm of a budget airline"
Absolutely disgrace! Avoid this airline. Spent the first part of the flight in a damp seat and the staff couldn't offer anything except some plastic sheeting to put over it. No complementary drinks or food offered in compensation. Flight then delayed by over an hour so we missed our connection and told we'd have to wait 8 hours in Amsterdam for the alternative connecting flight. Despite the fact that there was another flight an hour later. We were told catching this wasn't possible as it wouldn't 'allow enough time for our bags to be transferred' - even though this was longer than our original transfer time. Once again, no compensation offered, no real apology and no sense that the airline or the staff were going to go out of their way to correct the mistake. All the service and charm of a budget airline but without the compensatory price tag.

### "worst airline that I have experienced"
Warning! With the experience I had recently, stay away from KLM airline, they were nightmare, having sleepless night over my loss baggage since Juliy 22. They still not contact me yet to let me know what happened to my missing baggage. They are the worst airline that I have experienced.

### "Bravo to the staff"
Not Verified | Manchester to Las Vegas via Amsterdam. I arrived at Manchester check-in on 18th September and it turns out I had filled out my ESTA form incorrectly and as it stood would not be gained access to the US. The lady at the desk was really fantastic. She helped me with instructions as to filling in a new ESTA, lent me a pen, was most reassuring as to a positive outcome and, although I was pretty stressed, kept checking in on me. She periodically checked the status of my passport until the ESTA was approved and I got to the security area with half an hour to spare. Bravo to the staff who went above and beyond and got me to Vegas on that day. Thank you. Lost £6k in 5 days and thinking about moving into my wheelie bin for the winter.

### "carried a few extra kgs than allowed2
I had a very bad and bitter experience with the staff of KLM Dutch Airlines which flew from Delhi to Amsterdam. I carried a few extra kgs than allowed by the airline, and they charged heavily.

### "No customer service"
Not Verified |  No customer service, no response. The airline lost my luggage (Covid's fault). Yes, they blamed a disease rather than taking managerial (or lack of) ownership. I had to purchase personal items, the airline indicated I would be reimbursed. 2 months later - nothing. My claim is updated on a daily basis - by who? But, KLM has stopped writing to me. Imagine that. When flying, do not choose KLM.

### "lost 3 days of our 6 day vacation"
Not Verified |  If I could give zero stars I would! We were planning a trip to Scotland from the US for over 2 years due to covid, it was canceled back in 2020 ... we booked through Virgin Atlantic, but for some reason we never stepped foot on one of their planes. Delta was great with our first flight to Atlanta, and everything went downhill from there. When the time finally came to board our long flight with KLM, our excitement immediately fizzled. We arrived in Amsterdam and had a 24 hour layover, which we understand happens .... finally after trying to sleep in the airport overnight, it was time to board, at that time the staff announced our flight was delayed due to "short platform staff". After about 30-40 minutes they canceled it completely! At this time the staff at the gate would not help, we were sent across the airport, a good 10 minute speed walk, to a self serve kiosk to try to rebook our flight. After waiting an hour and a half in line, (as everyone booked on that plane had to do the same) we were sent an email of a rescheduled booking the airline made, without talking to us, for 2 DAYS later. We finally got to the beginning of the line to talk to someone and the only thing they did was give is a piece of paper with an email address to contact if we had any issues. We were told to keep our receipts as we had to find and pay for our own hotel, food and clothes (as they would not let us get our luggage) even though this was not any fault of our own, and "maybe get reimbursed". Two days passed back at the airport, now boarding our plane to Birmingham, as that was now our connecting flight to Scotland. We get on our plane to be delayed now 45 min while we wait for "late arrivers" . We get to Birmingham airport to be advised our connection was just now taking off. We try to find a KLM help desk, there was only Air France who refused to help as the connecting flight they booked us for was Loganair,  we were directed to a Gate for Loganair, where there was not a sole to help. Needless to say we were stranded!! We found a customer service desk for swiss airlines, and even though she does not work for KLM or Logan she tried her best to help, gave us KLM's customer service phone number and let us use her phone. after 30 min of hold time someone finally answered and said the next available flight wouldn't be until the next day, after we told him our situation he told us to just get someone at the airport to help .... the airport that had no one to help. Mind you we are how losing 3 days of our vacation! Money thrown out the window so to say. We were advised we should catch a train, the lady from swiss helped us find our luggage and we spent $123 per person to get a train. While we stood there waiting for our luggage to come down to us, we heard about 5 more horror stories on how KLM canceled and screwed them over with no help from staff! We lost 3 days of our 6 day vacation, that's money we lost for our previous hotel booking and car! Then New hotel charges out of pocket, and food for 2 days, as well as a train tickets to our actual destination. If you are looking to travel abroad, please make sure you don't have to set foot on a KLM aircraft

### "a terrible experience with KLM"
Not Verified |  I had a terrible experience with KLM traveling with two kids from USA to India on multiple counts. Special meal not in the system: I had requested veg meal for the three of us during check in but apparently they didn’t have it in the ‘system’. So my 2 yr old and I didn’t get anything. Delayed flight-missed connection-stranded in Kuwait: we had one layover in Amsterdam before heading to Mumbai but the flight was delayed and we missed our connection - they put us on Kuwait airlines which was also delayed with no further connections till following night. I was stranded in Kuwait with kids in tow for 24 hours. Missing luggage: no surprise when we land in Mumbai, the kid’s stroller and car seat didn’t arrive. Appalling customer service: I filed a claim online for flight delay-missing connection and missing luggage in June. There's no way to contact a human agent. After a month, I hear from Austin airport (not KLM) saying they have the car seat. Now, I get an email after 3 months of filing the claim that KLM is sorry about my experience but I should file a claim with Kuwait airlines. Never again KLM, once bitten twice shy.

### "a poor and disappointing experience"
Not Verified | Frankfurt to Buenos Aires via Amsterdam. My experience with KLM was very poor. Due to issues of KLM my flight from Frankfurt to Amsterdam was delayed so that I missed my connection flight to Buenos Aires. I had to wait in Amsterdam 24 hours for another KLM flight. I asked KLM for help to find a hotel for the night which they denied. I had to pay additional 160,00 Euro for hotel and Taxi. Next Day at the airport I had to wait 1 hour at the KLM helpdesk just to get the Information I should try to solve my refund problem myself online. The online refund request wasn't functioning and so I spent a frustrating 12 hours at the Amsterdam airport to wait for my next flight in the evening without a chance to request for my extra costs (hotel, taxi). The employees haven't been helpful and the online system wasn't working. Overall a poor and disappointing experience. I would recommend to choose a different airline if you have options.

### "this trip however was awful"
Not Verified |  We have flown KLM pre covid with pleasure this trip however was awful! People we traveled with had their kids seats re-assigned to middle seats throughout the plane leaving their 4 year old, 7 year olds and 8 year olds by strangers for the 9 hour flight and were told if they wanted to fly it was common for minors to fly unaccompanied so it was ok. With their children in tears because they couldn't sit with their parents an airline worker said "well do you want to fly or not?! to the parents. Finally someone gave up their seats when they heard what was happening. Turns out they had re-assigned them to all middle seats throughout the plane to upsell aisle seats and paid no attention to the ages or that it was a family. Service in the cabin left much to be desired and I finally got help and the air turned on as my 9 year old was getting air sick due to the heat and rough skies. Sometimes they were pleasurable but most of the interactions were curt and not friendly throughout our 9 hours in the air though I tried to be cordial and strike up conversation.

### "worst experience with an airline"
Used KLM from Rome to Lyon via Amsterdam. They gave a 40 min transit in Amsterdam, after confirming with them whether it would be enough they said yes. The flight from Rome to Amsterdam got delayed more than an hour, after arriving in Amsterdam the air bridge had a breakdown so had to hold up for so long, then ran to the gate for flight to Lyon. Reached the plane but this flight got delayed again, eventually it flew but when we reached Lyon our baggage had not arrived. I had all important stuff and medicines in that bag. Registered the complaint to KLM representative at the airport, but it’s been around 24 hours still haven’t received the bag. It has been my worst experience with an airline.

### "very rude and unprofessional"
Barcelona to Warsaw via Amsterdam. Such a Horrible experience flying with this company. 1st Flight was delayed, missed my connection and all other plans for the trip were ruined, their staff on the ground in Amsterdam is very rude and unprofessional. I had to book my own accommodation in Amsterdam because of the missed connection, pay for taxi and the food which was promised to be reimbursed, but it was not! Customer service is the worst, super slow and unprofessional. I've flown many different companies around the world and Overall its the worst airline company!

### "will never fly with KLM again"
Possibly the worst flying experience and I’ve flown a lot. My flight to Berlin was cancelled and rebooked for 5:30am. My flight back from Berlin was delayed and extremely long queues at Amsterdam airport meant I missed my connection. Currently stranded at the airport in another 2-3hour queue. I will never fly with KLM again.

### "referred to with proper pronouns"
Thank you KLM! As a transgender person, I am always very nervous and worried when it comes to traveling. I often get extra and offensive questions at airports as a result of my legal gender not matching who I am. KLM has done something extraordinary. Regardless of the gender on my documents, I am always referred to with proper pronouns as Ms. Erika Castellanos. I always get my booking and boarding pass as Ms. Castellanos also. I have not experienced this with no other airline, and I can only say what a huge difference this makes in my life. This evening I am traveling to Buenos Aires, and I am no longer as stressed as I used to be. Thank you, KLM, for recognizing me for who I really am.

### "I really liked their service"
Not Verified |  First time i fly with KLM and I really liked their service. The cabin crew were so kind and very helpful, they smile and ready to help us for anything we ask or need. No rude or no bad attitude. We enjoyed our trip

### "I will never fly with KLM again"
The check in the process was a nightmare. The staff was unprofessional and rude. We stranded at the ticketing counter for hours without any reason. We had children, one is under 2 years of age and they show no mercy or consideration for a passenger with special needs. We had total of 10 lugguages, counter staff in my suspecion scanned twice for one of our luggages or check us in with other passenger's luggage. They charged us for $200 for additional baggage, but will find out whose the 11th bag belongs to when we land to Nairobi. I will never fly with KLM again and definitely if you are someone with color, I would suggest you find another Airline that respects your values and human dignity.

### "will not recommend to anyone"
Worst Airline, even after paying money for all the services. I have not yet received my luggage for the past 1 week and I stranded in a new country without essentials and medicines. This is after taking a 48 hour flight. Pathetic and will not recommend to anyone.

### "KLM was a nightmare"
From booking to our final destination, KLM was a nightmare. They changed our flights and seats several times. The changes always resulted in longer layovers, worse seats, worst times, etc. The wait to talk to anyone on the phone was over an hour every time I called. One of the legs on our flights, which they booked us on Delta, they changed our flight but never notified Delta! Never again!

### "Lost my money, energy and holidays"
Not Verified |  Worst airline, ruined my whole trip, money gone. Wrong information on online. Don’t trust this airline. First flight canceled, then delayed. Then they said they will reimburse hotel bookings. I was alone travelling. Did not refund my amount. Never consider this airline for internal Europe trip. They said they will compensate for taxi and food, but it did never happened. Lost my money, energy and holidays.

### "KLM totally ruined our holiday"
Not Verified |  Worst experience of my life. Had booked flights that passed perfectly with train times. Then they changed all of our flights in and outbound. By that time we had bought train tickets. We weren't able to change the train times. So had to buy new tickets that set us back £150. Then because the flight was so early, we had to stay overnight in Copenhagen. Another £300. As if that wasn't enough we had to wait 7.50 hrs at Schiphol in the sweltering heat. So went outside for some fresh air. We were told we had to allow 3 hrs to be inside the airport and get through security, but that only took 15 minutes. As I am disabled I had to go to the disabled lounge. But everyone I asked directions sent us in a different direction. After an hour of traipsing back an forth a roasting airport we finally found where we had to be. 4 hours before we could board the plane. Then we had to overnight in Copenhagen again another £300. KLM totally ruined our holiday.

### "absolute worst experience"
KLM canceled our flight the night before take off with our giving any information on why and how we should proceed. Ended up re booking the ticket with an additional expense on train tickets that they said they would cover and we have still not heard from them or been able to get in contact with them after 7+ months of waiting for customer claims team to look into our case. This is the absolute worst experience ever when traveling and would not wish it on my worst enemy! This was the first and absolute last time we fly with klm, cannot recommend this to anyone!

### "the lowest grade business cabin"
I did a roundtrip and it is the lowest grade business cabin I have ever flown on. We are done with covid and its still a cold experience. The food was disgusting. Both legs they did not have my choice and finally on the way home I said I am sorry I cannot have shrimp because I am allergic to shellfish. They have deserted the beef or chicken mentality. The service was ok. but there is nothing provided to sleep on. Just a dirty seat, a pillow and a light baby blanket. It is not sanitary. The flight attendants were not proactively walking through the cabin on either long haul. I every time had to take my dirty dishes and coke cans to the galley and ask for something else. One time for mid-flight snack on and 11 hour amsterdam to Austin when I went to galley and for mid-flight snack they pulled out an eggroll type beef biscuit from oven that tasted like it had been in microwave for 20 hours. It is so sad. Its disgusting and I am sad for The Netherlands.

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience. My flight from DUS - AMS was delayed due to technical difficulties so I couldn't make my connection. Both flights were operated by KLM. Total chaos at AMS airport, nobody knew what was going on and what I had to do. Got the email that I was rebooked to a flight 2 days later. Stupidly enough I checked my carryon because the airline requested I do. So was stuck in Amsterdam for 2 days with nothing but my purse. Got myself an Airbnb, clothes, toiletries and food since my bags were checked through and I wasn't going to receive them before Southampton. Had to also rebook my travel arrangements in the UK which added to my expenses, in total I spent nearly 600€ due to their failure. When I was due to fly from AMS - SOU on the rebooked flight I asked at the check-in and at the boarding gate to check for my luggage. Check-in couldn't give me any answer, boarding assured me my luggage was on the cart that was due to be loaded into the plane. However, when I arrived in SOU there was no luggage. I got an email from SOU Airport that they found my luggage. It had already arrived the day prior. So either the software they track luggage with is garbage or I have been lied to by 2 people. Worst part is though, I have been waiting for any info on the compensation for my unexpected expenses since July 6th with horrible communication from their customer service. All communication is initiated by me, no matter who you speak to you get copy & paste responses, they don't care about your personal situation.

### "requested the refund in April 2020"
KLM cancelled my flight as the pandemic started and said I can get a refund. I requested the refund in April 2020 and have still not received it after years of following up. Shocking service and all I get is the same copy and pasted response when I follow up on it.

### "needlessly delayed on the airplane"
Service is fine but needlessly delayed on the airplane for over an hour. The pilot blamed Germany but have confirmed its due to Schiphol chaos. Airlines should be responsible to tell the truth when keeping paying customers hostage on the flights.

### "my experience very positive"
Flew KLM Cork to Seville via AMS. Second leg with Transavia which I review separately. Overall great trip , crews really friendly and genuinely smiling and in good humour. Embraer aircraft super comfortable great legroom. Drink and sandwich included . Somewhat rare these days. But really excelled on return. Our initial return cancelled a month ago and put on next days flight so overnight in Amsterdam. KLM paying for hotel so we got a bonus evening in Amsterdam really! Think just got lucky with this but not complaining. On return Boarded aircraft taxied about 500m and returned due technical issue. Pilot advised we require new aircraft and could take a while. Sat there for about 10 mins buses arrived all got on drive about 100m to another plane all got on and we’re on our way with about a 50 min delay! Very impressed with this. Guess the upside of cancelled flights means a few spare aircraft hanging about. So my experience very positive. I travel a lot for work and pleasure and really can’t fault KLM. As for Schipol itself, a whole other story!! !

### "baggage delays not lost baggage"
Very poor service from KLM. Travelled with a family of 4 from London City Airport and checked in our booked 8 hold luggage. At check in we were advised to check in our cabin bags also as that was what they were doing. Tagged with a limited release bag tag(never explained what this meant) Got to Accra after a 10 hour journey and not a single item came through on the baggage trolley. It was chaotic as about 30 travellers trooped to the Swissport station to report baggage non arrival. 6 days on KLM has sent through text messages that some of the bags have been identified. So far 2 hand luggages have been sent through and I am required to call everyday to the airport to see if any bags have come through. Granted the airports are having some baggage issues so why collect my cabin bags? Furthermore no communication of when I would receive my bags, and why can it not all come in one batch? This is unfair and very unprofessional totally disrupting the whole family plans and events that have been cancelled due to non arrival of baggages. If 2 bags could come through, why was the whole lot not sent through. This is unacceptable and damages my respect for KLM and the high esteem I had of the airline. No communication, no idea of what to expect…I doubt this happens on other routes. This is about baggage delays not lost baggage as I received emails saying some bags have been found and will be sent on the "next available flight" and 3 days on have still not arrived despite 2 flights having arrived.

### "the epitome of incompetence"
KLM has failed in every regard on our lost bags. We checked our bag in Houston for a 16 day vacation in Greece. The bag did not make it to Greece with our flight. We filed a claim and tracked the bag to Santorini where we were staying but no attempt was made to deliver our bag. We moved on to other Greek Islands. They will not take our calls about our lost baggage. They respond through their social media team but all they say is to be patient and they are waiting on information from the baggage department. Now their on line tracker is telling us when we search for the location of the bag that our file is no longer available. It has now been nearly 30 days, we are back home and no one can tell us where our bag is, whether it will be delivered back to us or when. KLM took too many reservations for travel through Amsterdam knowing that their workforce and the infrastructure of the Amsterdam airport could not handle that many passengers and bags. They claim that they are working the problem but I really don't think they are doing anything but giving up. They have lost thousands of bags and are completely overwhelmed and it is all their fault. We have filed the necessary claim for expenses incurred because our bags never made it to us either while we were on vacation or since we got home. They have ignored that claim and remain unresponsive. I would say to never fly this airline ever. They are the epitome of incompetence.

### "do not book with KLM"
Not Verified |  My flight was cancelled by KLM without any notice. When I tried to check in on the morning of the flight I was told I could not do so as it had been cancelled. Furthermore there was no assistance or attempt to find an alternative even though I am a Platinum for Life frequent flyer. As I was due to return 4 days later from a business trip I was forced to cancel the return journey myself. Obviously I claimed for a refund and was "awarded" an insulting 16 Euros per leg ie 32 Euros for a ticket costing around 500 Euros. My recommendation, do not book with KLM as they keep your money under all circumstances. In the end I travelled from Brussels with Brussels Air and this was a great alternative.

### "pay a little bit more so that you don’t have to deal with this terrible airline"
My flight from JFK to AMS was delayed for 3 hours. As a result, I missed my connecting flight in AMS. The next available direct flight wasn’t until 4 days later. The desk agent said that KLM doesn’t give out vouchers anymore, and that my hotel cost would be reimbursed. Now that I’ve submitted the receipts, their customer service is sending me the same message over and over saying they won’t compensate me, even though my situation is eligible per EU law. Do yourself a favor and pay a little bit more so that you don’t have to deal with this terrible airline.

### "Very bad service"
Not Verified | Amsterdam to Madrid. I had a tiny bag used for business so less than the size of a computer bag. At the door they decided to take it for checking in without any justification. They allowed other suitcases to get into the plan much bigger than mine. They didn’t even allow me to explain the right reasons why they should not do it as the suitcase fit underneath the seat without any problem. They acted rude and very unprofessional. Very bad service and totally discriminatory.

### "KLM was very slow in replying to my queries"
KLM lost my baggage while in transit from Amsterdam (Schipol Airport) to Scotland (Glasgow Airport). Since then, I have raised multiple appeals to find my luggage and finally just to claim for lost baggage. KLM was very slow in replying to my queries (status of my appeals and baggage) and now they have stopped completely. The airline seems oblivious to the concern and anxiety we passengers face when our luggage was lost (I had to live without the contents of my luggage for 81 days and counting). Even so, KLM chose to reply sporadically and non-specifically, averaging about 1 time a week. They provided no phone contact number and their online support staff continuously ask me to wait as they are ‘fetching more information’. This happened until the support ticket was mysteriously closed. This has happened for 2 times. All I wish is for me to either get my belongings back, or get compensation to buy back the things I lost, due to the airline’s inefficiencies.

### "stuck in Scotland with no luggage"
I have tried at least 8 different numbers to talk to someone about filing a claim. I have tried on-line and explained that to the one person I got hold of - I thought I finally was getting help and the person I then spoke to said they couldn't help either - use the on-line. I am currently stuck in Scotland, with no luggage what so ever and am unable to file a claim. I realize things right now are crazy - but this is ridiculous.

### "always friendly and efficient"
Not Verified |  Tampa to Edinburgh via Amsterdam. We flew to Edinburgh on my husband's birthday. We were completely surprised when the flight attendant serving beverages wished him a happy birthday. Later in the flight she brought him a gift bag of food and snacks and a card signed by the whole crew of Flight KL1277. Totally unexpected and really appreciated. We flew two routes on KLM on this trip and the customer service was always friendly and efficient. No cancellations, late arrivals or lost luggage. If we are able we certainly intend to fly this airline again.

### "KLM lies"
KLM lies. We were asked if we could check our carry on at the gate because the flight was very full. They said we would again get them directly at the gate after the flight and would not have to wait at the baggage claim. So we wanted to help out and gave them our carry-ons. After the flight they said that they were not giving us the carry-ons at the gate and that we have to pick them up at the baggage claim. Because of the problems at Schiphol these days we have to wait a long time to get them!

### "Incompetently run company with poor customer service"
Checked our luggage at LAX to Amsterdam on June 24 , 2022.Wait in Las Vegas was 3 hours. Arrived on time in Amsterdam. Immigration was chaotic and took 1 hour to clear. No luggage seen. Told to wait. Unable to locate for 2 hours more. Told left in Las Vegas. Told will deliver to hotel. Had to leave for the river cruise on 26 th. Airline notified of the cruise locations for the next eight days. No one answers the phone for 30 minutes and then disconnects. Communication is only on line to update our address. Told luggage found and to be shipped to Stuttgart. All three pieces arrived on three different days. No luggage received till July 3rd on the boat. KLM notified of our address in London till July 6th, then to be delivered to us in the USA. No person helpful at the airport. No person reachable by phone. No response via email from KLM on their initiative to keep us informed. No instructions as to our rights and compensation from KLM. Incompetently run company with poor customer service.

### "Never flying with KLM again!"
First flight canceled. Got rebooked and arrived several hours later than planned. Return flight canceled. Rebooked to a flight the upcoming day. This flight just got canceled too. Don’t know when I’ll return home. Changing the airline now would cost me a couple of hundred euros extra, not to mention the amount of extra flying hours and connections that comes with it, and costs for extra hotel nights, also missing a very important meeting because of this. Never flying with KLM again!

### "no guarantee that my flight won't be cancelled"
I cancelled my connecting flight with no option to rebook it. The customer service line closes at 8 pm and after this only Whatsapp or messenger with a chatbot is available. After waiting for 1 hour in the queue for the actual agent to connect with me he gave me an option for a new ridiculous route with no guarantee that my flight won't be cancelled again. I spend over 3 hours on chat only to get the short message at the end that he is passing my info to the booking team and if the flights are still available they will rebook it just after he gives me the option for another day. He said that my options might not be available anymore since my request took a long time! it was him sitting silently for more than 3 hours! The ridiculous airline, non-existing customer service. After spending 4 hours online I still don't know If I will be flying as an agent last message was please do not answer to this message!

### "Very horrible service"
Where should I start? First our flight was delayed for more than 2 hours in Accra, there was no email or text from KLM. While on the way to Amsterdam, while using their free Wi-Fi for the last hour of the flight I saw an email pop up from there but I was unable to check it so I WhatsApp my brother my email login to check. The email from KLM flight said that you have missed your flight to London Heathrow so we have rebooked you on a new BA flight that was 14.55pm almost 8 hours later than our original flight since we were supposed to get to LHR 9.00am. Long lines at the airport since you have to now get new tickets. No one to help you. Imagine being in long lines with 2 year old twins who are tired and hungry. When we arrived to London 4.20pm we received none of our bags. Trying to contact KLM and they keep saying to go online to make a claim. Online when we put in the booking number it says it cannot be found. This was since Monday/Tuesday up to now there has been no call or email from KLM. Very horrible service. I will never fly KLM again.

### "Customer service is very poor"
Customer service is very poor. I attempted to purchase cabin baggage and after 3 attempts to call I was told I must wait and purchase at the desk on the day of my flight. They would not provide me with a price either. Upon arrival at the airport for my flight I was quoted a price of 95 Euro for 23kg. I would not have taken an extra bag if I was provided this price before traveling to the airport. There needs to be better customer service where a customer can be provided with this information ahead of time. By taking this additional cost into consideration it would have been much more affordable to travel with a different airline that allowed cabin baggage at an affordable price. I will not be flying with KLM again.

### "changed to we will ignore passengers"
Not Verified |  KLM waited 2 1/2 hours for delayed passengers to arrive 1 by 1. 90 passengers cost us 2 1/2hrs. No water and no changes made for connecting passengers. In 8 hours. The purser mocked saying crew don’t organise taxis either. Dumped passengers in Vancouver. No ground crew. It was survival of the fittest. The usual ‘can do’ attitude of KLM was changed to we will ignore passengers. 2 1/2 hr delay was a cost avoidance exercise by KLM corporate to get a full plane. Crew/captain did not ask us to give priority to connecting passengers for exiting. Captain praised the crews non existing efforts to secure alt flights.

### "Very bossy and annoying"
Only one counter open for baggage drop off, thus long line. We reached baggage line 100 minutes before boarding and still in the line when boarding time started. None of the staff were courteous enough to take passengers ahead who's boarding time has started. We had to run with kids and not sure if we will make the flight through security. Gate staff behaving as if it is our fault they had one counter open to take baggage. Lot of anxiety, passengers from back jumping in front, passengers from later flights telling us what to do. Very bossy and annoying. mismanagement. Incompetent staff thinking we just made it as if it was our fault.

### "I am still waiting for my baggage"
Until this time, I had too many flights without any problems. However, the last KLM experience was horrible for me. 21st June, I had a flight from Mexico City to Frankfurt am Main via Amsterdam. Because of the 1 hour 45 minute waiting time in Amsterdam, everything was looking good for me. I went to Mexico City airport 3 hours ago because of the precaution of some long waiting times, but check-in and baggage drop transactions were extremely quick. I am really appreciative for that. However, when I went to gate for boarding, boarding had not started. We have waited so long and after 1 hour 30 minutes from original departure time we have departed. When we were in flight, the hostess announced please check your e-mail, sms or mobile application for the connecting flight update. When we landed in Amsterdam, of course my other Frankfurt plane has gone and KLM checked in for a soonest Frankfurt flight for me and for this flight they gave me sky priority. Because of the sky priority, I had also tracking bags section in mobile application. When I tried to track my bag, there was only one notification for check-in, after that nothing happened. I had understood that probably they lost my baggage. After we landed to Frankfurt am Main, I have waited for my baggage and it did not come. I went to lost baggage desk and she said to me my baggage is still in Amsterdam and in 1-2 days we are going to send your baggage directly to your home address and because of the 1-2 days situation I was happy. But, currently I am still waiting for my baggage and I need to go to another country tomorrow morning. My personal care products, some of my medicines and other important things are in that luggage and currently, I am really in bad situation. I have never forget this horrible experience.

### "awful customer service experience"
There is unfortunately no way to give zero stars for the experience I have had with KLM. Flight was late arriving to Geneva and I was supposed to fly to Ghana from Amsterdam so missed my connecting flight. There were no flights that day so had to fly the next day. I was told in Amsterdam I would get a refund for the delay and also had to take a covid test as the one I had would have no longer been valid, which I was also told I would be reimbursed for. This was on 10 Dec 2021. After following up regularly I was told each time that my claim was being processed which I now know was a not the truth as on 10 June I received a message saying "Thank you for your communication dated 11 December 2021. I regret the unintentional delay in responding to you". Today I received a response saying "the flight was delayed due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft as a consequence of adverse weather conditions", without further explanation, and as such I was not entitled compensation, or refund for the covid test which on the KLM website would be considered as "unforeseen expense"(which you could claim for). I am highly confused as to what the adverse weather conditions was. They simply sent this one line after 6 months of my follow up without providing any evidence even though as per the EU air passenger rights it says "To be exempted from paying compensation, the airline must prove that: i) there is a link between the extraordinary circumstances and the delay or the cancellation, and ii) the delay or cancellation could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken. KLM are unfortunately complacent, they are very comfortable in delivering awful customer service experience. Avoid this airline at all cost because they do not care.

### "Stay away from KLM!"
The flight from London was late so we missed the connecting flight to Washington DC. When we landed, I got a text saying I had been rebooked on another flight that left in 9 mins from when we landed. I got off the plane and tried to find the flight and gate for the new flight but it was not on the screen. I literally had to walk 15 minutes before I could find any KLM staff members. They would prefer you just use a self transfer kiosk. Well, I went to the kiosk and it froze. I tried to go to another kiosk and it said I was still logged on. I’m frantic thinking my flight leaves soon, and there’s literally no one to talk to. I asked staff from other airlines where can I find any KLM staff. Finally found a place and of course there’s no one there. Nor at the next place. Only the third desk and there’s about 100 people in line with the same frustrations as me! No real line, no directions. There’s only 2 people trying to help 100 tired, stuck, angry people. The staff were super lovely and tried to be helpful but it was obvious KLM is trying to save money on staffing. Anyway, my flight is rebooked to 26 hours later and there’s no other airlines that KLM work with that go to DC? In addition to this, the seats on the plane have no leg room and don’t recline. Stay away from KLM!

### "baggage will probably not show for several days"
Flight delayed, not a big problem. Connection time tight with an other klm flight. Baggage did not follow. One week without baggage. Return to Montreal with no baggage. They have a long delay to answer on help lines. Please wait 24 hours the bag is on the way they said, day after day. Now baggage will probably not show for several days. There is no reason why the delivery could not be done after 24-48 hours. They confirmed many times that they had my bag in hand. I will avoid this airline as much as as possible.

### "KLM managed their delays quite well"
Flew KGL-EBB-AMS-CPH with KLM 15-16 June 2022 on A330-300 and Embraer aircrafts. Check-in online did not work – likely due to summer-overload of passengers in Amsterdam which causes disruptions and delays on the entire route-net. However, the check-in KGL was quick and hassle-free. Access to KLMs 3rd party Pearl lounge was granted due to my Flying Blue gold card. The lounge is well supplied, but of sparse offerings. The arriving aircraft in Kigali came in 1 hour late. The KLM staff called all passengers to gate; after wasting an hour in the gate they came back to the terminal and lounge due to further delays: the aircraft had got another, now technical problem (a clogged engine filter? ), which they manage to fix in the airport. However, this added to the delay by another 2 hours. The now 3 hours’ delay followed us the whole way to AMS where most passengers eventually lost onwards connections. All entering and exits to aircrafts were by foot and stairways. Onboard, flights were full, haven’t seen this since before the pandemic. KLMs flight crews onboard are in general patronizing and surly, but they managed well. Food was surprisingly good, seems improving with 3 hot meal options for dinner. Hot snacks provided before landing. Managed to sleep 3 hours on the longhaul. IFE worked wel with individual, tiny screens with movie choices. Headsets provided. WiFi not working? In Amsterdam it took 45 minutes to vacate the aircraft which was taxied to a remote area of the airport. Huge queues in Amsterdam due to summer peak and staff shortages. I was fairly lucky to be rebooked on next AMS-CPH flight departing 2-3 hours later. Lounges in AMS are good, spacious and modern. Despite the delays the last flight and arrival in Copenhagen went well and smooth. CPH airport is a breeze. My inscribed luggage arrived to perfection, despite rebooking, delays, and transfers. In conclusion KLM managed their delays quite well. For the modest ticket price paid (500 EUR t/r), one can’t complain a lot

### "KLM had provided the best customer support I have experienced"
We have flown with KLM from Budapest to Amsterdam in June 2022. The aircraft had a computer malfunction before taking off therefore the flight had to be cancelled. We were notified and rebooked to a flight for the following morning within 30 minutes. KLM had provided the best customer support I have experienced with an airline so far. We applied for a refund which was handled within 3 working days and the refund was transferred to my bank account within 2 weeks. The whole experience was great, I am very satisfied with the support they provided.

### "I will never use KLM again"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight Toronto - Bucharest via Amsterdam in April 2022. Few days before we left KLM canceled our morning flight from Bucharest to Amsterdam and forced us to get a flight one day earlier with a night over in Amsterdam to catch a next day original flight to Toronto. That forced us to sleep a night in Amsterdam and short the trip in Romania. I called KLM support and was assured that once I take the deal I will be compensated for the hotel, cab and food in Amsterdam if I fill a compensation claim upon the return. We filled the claim which got turned down due. On the evening we got to Amsterdam the baggage handlers were in strike causing a total mess in the airport with cancelled and delayed flights. I will never use KLM again: poor in flight service, poor logistics, poor customer support.

### "an absolute nightmare"
I was supposed to depart Dublin on Friday at 18:25. I got an email the day before saying the flight was canceled and I needed to rebook the flight. The only flight that would work with my ticket was at 5:55 am Friday. This made me miss the Friday business meetings. On top of that - I could not download the boarding pass for the flight because they overbooked the 5am flight as well. By the grace of god, there was a security guard at Dublin that helped me out and took me to the KLM boarding station. Again, I didnt have a seat because they overbooked the flight. Just an absolute nightmare.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified |  I flew with KLM on May 2022 and my experience was not that great. My baggage did not arrive with me and I have to follow-up with KLM multiple times to receive the same. Poor customer service

### "connecting flight cancelled just before boarding time"
Our connecting flight from Amsterdam to Geneva was cancelled just before boarding time - so we were routed to go to Geneva vis Paris / which we did. However our luggage did not come on our flight and we had to register a Misplaced Luggage Report at Geneva Airport, and the luggage arrived the next evening and was delivered to our hotel. Also due to the delay our Car Rental was not available as the counter had closed - and our booked car was given away to another customer, and we had to go to the hotel by Taxi - spending EU: 50.00. Next day we had to rent a car from another company by paying approx EU: 500 extra for our trip. I would think KLM should be reimbursing this amount to us for the Cancelled Flight which has lead to all of this.

### "want to know when I'm getting my refund"
Not Verified |  The KLM staff at the gate gave me my new boarding pass and a piece of paper saying I should book my own hotel and taxi then go to the website as indicated on that piece of paper for the refund. I did confirm with the KLM Staff at the gate who said I'll get my refund. She said it's straight forward but I still find it strange that the KLM staff did not even bother to offer help or assist in finding a hotel, taxi etc. Instead they handed me a piece of paper saying I should claim for it. I'd like to know when I will get my refund as its been a while now. It's not fair that customers are facing so much trouble with you. Some people can't afford to pay for hotel, taxi, food because they could not catch their KLM flight due to whatever circumstances KLM is talking about. Even after customers end up carrying these extra unforeseen expenses because of the fault of KLM, customers like me end up frustrated as we need the refund but we aren't getting an update on when we'll get the refund. I don't feel comfortable using your airline anymore. I want to know when I'm getting my refund.

### "Staff is extremely nice and attentive"
One of the best airlines I have ever flown with. Staff is extremely nice and attentive. Planes are newish and very clean. Also, even on a short 1,5 hour trip from Prague to Amsterdam and back you receive complimentary soft beverages and a free egg or cheese sandwich. Keep it up KLM, if I have the option I will always fly with you.

### "KLM generally is ok"
Amsterdam to New York. I have never had any issues on international flights and KLM generally is ok. I fully understand that booking an economy seat means that you are to stay in economy, logically. During my flight, I was feeling very nauseous (I was holding it in and had already used the nausea bag, but very much had to vomit again) and needed to get the restroom immediately. During this time, the food was being distributed and the staff was unable/refused to let me pass by the carts to reach the restroom in economy. My next best option was to run to the restroom located in business class. Once I left the restroom, a flight attendant was waiting outside and immediately asked “where is your seat?” After I explained my situation and even apologized for using the restroom, she rudely said “you were in there for 10 min. You can’t be here and need to stay in your class, we don’t make exceptions here. Please return to your class.” I am hoping that in the future, exceptions can be made in such cases, as I would think that an economy passenger using a business class restroom in an emergency, would be more pleasant to both passengers and staff, than the smell of vomit / cleaning up after a sick passenger. Note to mgmt: I would keep an eye on how your staff handles certain situations and speaks to passengers, as this kind of attitude could easily turn away frequent fliers.

### "I now come back to no luggage"
After having no food on both flights as they don't provide food for vegans, even though I pre ordered a vegan meal 8 months in advance, I now come back to no luggage either. They left it Amsterdam due to the delays. They have made things impossible from start to finish and made the trip a nightmare. No food, no working Wi-Fi, and now no luggage. Absolute joke. Avoid at all costs and what makes it worse is you can't do anything about it for 21 days and they don't answer the phone so there's even less chance of you ever getting your luggage back

### "I would fly with them again"
Not Verified |  They had wooden cutlery, avoided plastic wrappings, offered vegetarian meals as default and had recycled paper for toilet paper. The service was excellent - polite, professional and prompt. We traveled with a baby and they explained clearly how to use the baby seatbelt and basinet for best safety and comfort. They also gave us a bib with a handwritten note to acknowledge the baby's first flight which was a sweet gesture. Even though we had a short layover the AMS airport was organised and KLM ensured we boarded on time without stress. I would fly with them again.

### "claim closed with no compensation"
Luggage lost, claim closed with no compensation. We recently flew KLM to Spain April 11. Overall we had a good experience on the flight, the attendants were kind and my daughter who is a picky eater ate the entire meal. The flight was fairly on time. Unfortunately our luggage did not make it to Spain and we filed a luggage claim immediately at the Valencia airport. We opened a claim number with KLM and had to buy the necessities upon our arrival. We made daily checkins online and that they were still locating the luggage. KLM said that we would be reimbursed for our expenses. After 5 days, the site's update was to make a lost luggage claim. It is now May 30 and after numerous emails back and forth with receipts of our purchases, claim amount for the items in the luggage we were shocked to find that the claim had been closed. Upon calling, KLM's response was that you need to restart the process and file the claim again! So, again putting together all the receipts and sending over a list of all the items and their value that were lost. I don't know if this is KLM's hope that over time and inconvenience that these claims would be forgotten or sidelined but we intend to keep on KLM to ensure that our expenses and lost baggage are not pushed to the side and that we are compensated for the items and our time.

### "Crew have been friendly, aircrafts clean and no major delays"
Flying in pandemic times is not easy. After I booked my flight in February I got a few days later a change of schedule. On the way to MNL my afternoon flight from HAJ to AMS was cancelled and I have been rebooked on a morning flight which leads into a 9 hour layover in AMS. Also my return to flight MNL-AMS has been cancelled and I need to fly back one day earlier as booked. After check-in in Manila my flight AMS to HAJ have been also cancelled and next available flight was 3 hours later. However due to present situation I understand the problems airlines facing. The flight experience itself was quite ok. Crew have been friendly, aircrafts clean and no major delays. During short flights HAJ-AMS-HAJ they serve a snack and water. The flight to MNL had a stop in BKK. Two meals on the way to and from BKK. Quality was ok outbound AMS and good outbound BKK. Only one bottle water has been provided at the seat, could be more, however it was possible to get more but need to walk to the galley to get it. BKK to MNL and back a sandwich was served. Check in procedure was efficient, however security check in AMS on the way back was hassle due to long queues. Seats on B777 becomes a bit uncomfortable after several hours off flying. Allover a good experience.

### "Nonexistent customer service"
Short trip with one layover. Flight cancelled and rebooked on short notice to very inconvenient time. The two delayed flights. Nonexistent customer service. Even in their home airport there is no help desk. Rude and inflexible staff at the airport. I would advise against using KLM if at all possible. I have only heard bad things about their so called customer service.

### "changed the momentum from negative to very positive"
The flight from Rome to Amsterdam was delayed by an hour, which affected my next connection. The lovely stewardesses changed the momentum from negative to very positive. They did everything possible to answer all my questions, provide information on connection and the gates, and did that while having a friendly smile on their faces.

### "never left and thus arrived on time"
Fly KLM regularly and have never left and thus arrived on time. Unfortunately I work for a Dutch company that has to use them so there is no chance for me - choose any other airline instead of this very expensive airline.

### "The food was delicious"
After a flight in Economy to Amsterdam I pampered myself with an upgrade into Business Class. The transfer in Amsterdam was easy and nice. I did not had to take out the computers and the liquids at the security check like three years ago. Amazing and so convenient. My stay at the lounge was nice and my favourite place was the open terrace. Boarding was easy and simple. A nice welcome on board and a most amazing crew. I felt immediately welcome. The single seat where I can get in and out without bothering someone else was very nice. In the sleeping position it was a bit claustrophobic for me, especially in the area of the legs. But otherwise the seat is nice and comfortable. The food was delicious as I have expected it. The KLM catering in Amsterdam is very good. They did a great job. The more than 11 hours flight was without any special problems. It was smooth and nice. Arrival in Mexico City was chaotic as always. Actually I must confess that the immigration was working very fast. But the receive the baggage was a bit of a nightmare. They moved it from belt to belt but finally the luggage got delivered. Thanks again to the crew. They were all amazing and did go a step further than they need to do.

### "they will see me again on board"
It was my first flight after three years. Many things have changed and it is not that easy anymore. But even the preparation for my flight were easy with KLM. All the information concerning Covid I could find on there web page. That way I was well prepared to get to the airport. The Economy Class seat had not changed. Everything as three years ago. The staff was nice and helpful. What I have to complain about is the situation that they do not offer two different meals any more. For dinner we had only a pasta which will be fine for vegetarians too. Unfortunately the quality of that was not the best. At least for breakfast we had the choice between an egg dish and a sweet dish. What I noticed was that my neighbour had a bigger portion than me. That was concerning the fruits and the egg. I got the feeling that I had the leftovers. All together that means the catering is not the best in Cape Town. KLM should look for another catering company or check the one more often. The flight itself was without any special events. We were slightly delayed because of a computer problem at check in. But that could happen anytime with everyone. Finally I must say it was a nice experience again and they will see me again on board.

### "don't care about their customers"
Flight booked from Amsterdam to Edinburgh. 4 hour security queue at Schipol during which we were informed our flight home to Edinburgh had been cancelled. No KLM staff to speak with, KLM's phone service was no use at all. Eventually got airside to try to arrange transfer, no KLM staff to be found anywhere for at least an hour, probably hiding from customers. Automated transfer kiosks would not work. Eventually tracked down a KLM agent who had clearly been told to wash her hands of the situation and told us to find a hotel for however long it takes before we were rebooked on to the next flight. That flight was 2 days later. No attempt to help us, and we were basically abandoned by KLM. They don't care about their customers; once they have your money they are happy to abandon their duty of care to their customers is soon as it suits them, and no attempt will be made to help, and they will do everything in their power to avoid paying compensation. I requested compensation for the cancelled flight and was given the usual air traffic excuse (not KLM's fault, nothing ever is) and told I wasn't entitled to compensation. The usual air-traffic excuse is quite pathetic, it's a go-to excuse all airlines wheel out when they're trying to weasel their way out of paying out compensation to customers for their bad management. The fact is that no attempt was made to assist with finding us accommodation until the rebooked flight 2 days later departed, and we were abandoned by KLM right at the point at which their duty-of-care to their customers should have come into place. I will never fly KLM again.

### "Worst experience possible"
Amsterdam to Los Angeles. Worst experience possible. KLM top this low quality flying experience. Never ever choose it again. I wish we had negative rating cuz they don’t even deserve 0.

### "lowest possible quality of airlines"
Had to wait in a Line for 4 hours to check-in at the desk. At Vancouver airport my suitcase was missing. But there was no KLM official available to make a report. So, I had to go back next day to get that done. After An online check of my report I found out that they had misspelled my name, my email address and my telephone number. I tried to contact KLM by phone (3 different numbers) and 3 days in a row but received the message that I would be disconnected because of too Many calls, then I tried Whatsapp. Somebody (or was it a computer?) reacted asking me if I would like to have contact with An agent. I answered yes and received the message that the agent would contact me as soon as possible. Three days later still no further response. KLM, once a high quality airline  has dropped to the lowest possible quality of airlines that I have ever flown with.

### "It’s been 5 days now and still no sign of our luggage"
Terrible airline! First they cancel our flight without informing us and they just put us on a flight the next day. After being on hold for more than an hour with their customer service I was able to change it to a different flight. Then we arrive at Schiphol and our luggage get’s lost. It’s been 5 days now and still no sign of our luggage. Many phone calls later and being on hold for hours no one is able to give me a timeline on when we can expect our luggage or information about some sort of compensation for having to buy new clothes, toiletries etc. for a family of 5. This is causing us a lot of stress and taking a lot of joy out of our vacation. It’s an absolute disgrace!

### "they will kill the joy of flying"
The biggest rip-off baggage excess ever. €125 for 3.7kg. For overseas flights that’s really punitive. Delays and strikes not included in the price, they will kill the joy of flying.

### "KLM helped me get through the queues"
Thank you KLM! I am an cardholder with KLM and I thank goodness I am! Schiphol was exceptionally busy due to holiday flights and staff shortage. Waiting times of 1 hour for bag check. I would have missed my flight if it wasn't for my frequent flyer status. KLM helped me get through the queues. I arrived well on time at the gate. The flight left 10 minutes late, but arrived 10 minutes ahead of schedule! Staff we gentle, welcoming. The embraer is a very comfortable plane, I prefer it over the B737 seating.

### "money they false charged me for"
Due to a family crisis I had to leave leave Canada 2 weeks early and called customer service to change the date of my 900€ flight ticket . I was told that I had to pay the price difference between the new and the old ticket, which was another 800€. I had no choice so I gave them my card information to pay the price difference, but when I got the price overview on mail I realized I had been charged for all fees 3 times - so pretty much 400€ too much. I called customer service right away, and was told I could fill out an online form after my trip. I tried this when I was back home, but the form didn’t work because “i had already used my ticket”. Now it’s been 1,5 month and I have still not succeeded with claiming my money back. I’ve been told they haven’t received the money (something my bank said they have), I’ve been told to send an email to this address that never responded, and in customer service I’m just being sent around. I’m about to give up getting back the money they false charged me for, because it’s impossible to reach through to someone who can actually help.

### "24 hour delay being stuck at the airport"
KLM knew in advance about the delays however no provision, no contingency plan was made to accommodate clients. Missed 2 connecting flights due to KLM delays, then waited 7 hours to be assisted just to be told, I cannot fly same day. There are only flights available tomorrow. 24 hour delay being stuck at the airport with no hotel, no place to sleep or shower. Staff was unapologetic and lacked compassion. I missed the previous flight boarding by 4 min and the lady at the counter refused to let me board, while she still helped the person in front of me. The lack of organization, provision and compassion is disgusting.

### "strongly recommend choosing another airline"
Worst flight experience ever. Both of our flights were delayed and we had do spend a night in Amsterdam - no support provided from airline, we had to book hotel for unexpected stopover by ourself. On next rebooked flight we had to sit for more than hour in muggy airplane, when we heard that due to technical reasons we have to change it (overall more than 3 hours delay). On return flight they lost our luggage. It’s really funny that their advertising slogan says “royal”. Definitely not a “royal” experience. I strongly recommend choosing another airline. (Flight from Gdansk to Lisbon (stopover in Amsterdam)

### "KLM ground crew just went on strike"
Arrived in Amsterdam after a long and delayed flight. Literally ran to my gate only to find the flight was still at the gate and no one had boarded. KLM ground crew just went on strike. Two hours later and there is no news whatsoever. Flight was just cancelled. I called Delta (originally booked with Delta) and they didn't know the strike was happening. Called KLM 10.00am in Amsterdam and their service center is closed. Used the whatsapp to contact them and I was asked for ticket number, name and booking reference. Gave all info and an hour later, no response. Found an article online saying the ground crew is underpaid, overworked and just received notice that KLM is going to outsource their jobs. Clearly this airline is struggling financially and I highly recommend that you choose not to fly with KLM.

### "become worse than the budget airlines"
KLM pre pandemic were a good airline. However since covid they have become worse than the budget airlines. My most recent flight really sums up the mess that is KLM at the minute, they lost my bag in Schiphol. Ok this happens and they used to be very good at getting it to you but I guess as a cost saving exercise they’ve switched to a budget courier, so I land Tuesday 19th April without my luggage after I dozens of phone calls, WhatsApp messages I learn it’s somewhere in Schiphol. Once they locate my bag the ship it to Leeds and hand it off to what I can only assume is a man with a van. The companies name is Eagle aviation and at first glance on their website they look professional but once you try and contact them it all goes wrong. They have a premium rate number to call that leaves you on hold for 10-20 minutes then cuts you off, their website has a tracking feature showing an ETA but once this comes and goes how on earth do you get your baggage when they don’t answer emails or calls? I know this is a review of KLM and not the courier company but by giving this company a contract they are by extension a representative of klm and the responsibility lies with klm. A very quick Google search and 2 minutes reading the reviews of said company tells you all you need to know about them yet KLM clearly didn’t do this as I suspect they were just the lowest bidder. So back to klm, after reaching out to them about my bag because I have nowhere else to turn to I’m just fobbed off with “we will look into it and pass your concerns on to the relevant department” I’m really at a loss so I need to start driving around the UK looking for my bag at courier depots? I understand now why so many people only bring carry on to KLM flights. If you have a choice of airline choose another one I wish I had a choice.

### "third suitcase is still missing"
KLM lost our bags. Since 20 days there is no way to get in touch, get any help, any support, any answers. We filed for the lost bags at the airport and 2 of the 3 have been recovered (we had to pick them up ourselves since they are too busy). The third suitcase is still missing though and it is impossible to get any help with it. Hotlines in all countries are so busy that even after 30 min wait noone answers. Complaints filed online are not being replied to. We paid thousands of Euros to have a great experience but KLM seem to go out of their way to make this a nightmare.

### "change could not be made"
Due to the restrictions imposed by the Rwandan authorities on entering the country, we requested the change of the airport of embarkation and return from Kigali to Dar es Salaam, with the payment of the price differences. Neither online nor by telephone, directly with the KLM agency, this change could not be made, although when I requested a new ticket on the route Dar es Salaam - Bucharest there were places available. In these conditions, I requested the cancellation of the ticket, which was for April 22, 2022, and the return of the money. In the KLM mischief, they announced to me on 21.04.2022 that they were returning only 97.47 euros out of the 1102 euros paid for a ticket that could not be changed.

### "an utter disaster"
Not Verified | Amsterdam to Panama City. This was just plain awful on both legs. The only positive is the generous legroom. Everything else was an utter disaster. Worst was the food, which was simply inedible (lots of passengers refused to even take it). On an 11 hours flight, they serve you a toasted white bread with a single slice of some cheap cheese and two thin slices of cucumber (a toastie) for "lunch". Just plain awful. The other one (dinner) was curry, but with such an awful strong smell that it made you want to open a window. A few tiny cube-shaped dry chicken bits. Something I take for rice pudding as dessert, but really yuk, like glue. Beverages were lukewarm, service was efficient but far from friendly. Flight entertainment is unusable because the earbuds are so poor that you cannot hear or understand anything at all over the engine noise, even on full volume. Completely impossible to watch a movie or listen to music. It was a long and disappointing flight, my first and last time with KLM. Wifi doesn't work at all, the website where you enter your details to book a package simply doesn't respond.

### "transatlantic journey was a gem"
A beautiful experience. The early morning short European hop was wonderful. A great staff (mostly Purser) served a wonderful breakfast in a warm efficient service. Standard inter-European seats, though not great, were fine for the short hop. Transfer in Amsterdam was messy but no fault of KLM. The transatlantic journey was a gem. Great plane, great seat, very good food and drink. Full meal, mid flight snack and before landing lunch kept me full and happy. Extremely attentive crew worked hard and were very kind.

### "improvement over the other flights"
Not Verified |  Our original tickets were booked for return with Lufthansa from Newark to Amsterdam with one stop over each way. This is a review for our return which was through Swiss Air code share that got overbooked and we were handed over to KLM instead for the return. The highly objectionable parade of delays, changes, over bookings came to a pleasant end with KLM. This was an improvement over the other flights we had, from the customer service at Schipol who re-ticketed us to the cabin crew, plane seats and the food on the flight. While the beverage cart and intermittent service was not noteworthy, the lunch and dinner were excellent, they had a salad, pasta and warm bread with cheese that were excellent. We got only hand luggage. The lack of pillows questionable as they are to ones comfort was odd.

### "absolutely ghastly customer service"
If I could give zero stars I would. We flew from London Heathrow to Amsterdam as one leg on our honeymoon. The process to check in luggage should have been our first clue. They allowed so many people to pay to check an enormous amount of luggage. The pilot made a joke about how much luggage they were trying to load on the plane as it delayed our takeoff. When we arrived to Amsterdam, our luggage (and about 10 other groups of people) was not on the carousel. One of the other passengers made a comment that this same thing happened last time she flew KLM but she figured it was a fluke and gave them another chance. We are now six days later. There has been absolutely no update. Initially we were promised our luggage later that evening, which seemed reasonable as there were six more flights from Heathrow to Amsterdam that day. As of today, they will give us no update, will not tell us any information about the luggage searching process, and today hung up on me when I asked why we had to fill out the bag inventory again (we completed the inventory and have a confirmation email with the completed form). Horrible from the check in and absolutely ghastly customer service. Has completely ruined our honeymoon trip as we have absolutely no clothes or belongings.

### "never be choosing this airline again"
Not Verified |  The worst experience of life time. They lost my bag which had my wedding dress, just 12 days before my wedding. Not only that, they never figured out after 28 days and didn’t provide any updates or compensation . Unfortunately I booked round trip with them and my return flight had no check in bags allowed. There was no phone number or email to reach and worst experience of my life. I will never be choosing this airline again.

### "lack of courtesy and respect"
I have been a fan of KLM for 20 years. I have had mostly positive experiences but my recent trip was shocking. MAN-AMS on KL1080 12APR was delayed for nearly 3 hours due to an IT outage at Manchester Airport. We were left for at least 45' past scheduled departure time, without any information by the ground staff. When we finally boarded we were promised we would be looked after once we had landed in Amsterdam. So many people lost connecting flights but you have to accept that sometimes things do not go as planned. What was really unacceptable is that there was not even one KLM employee available at Schiphol after our arrival to take care of rebookings and hotel accommodation. Even their transfer desk were sealed off. We were left without any service. We were roaming the airport desperate to find an employee but in vein. People broke down crying. I booked a hotel on my own expense and a train ticket the next morning to continue my trip as KLM clearly did not want to help. Their service center hotline was not responsive. I am still stunned with the lack of courtesy and respect towards their customers. It was a nightmare.

### "They don’t care"
Not Verified |  This is not about the flights but before you fly and try to book. Part of the travel experience though. I tried to book an award ticket after being a long time passenger with KLM. Nothing wrong with the flights and they are nothing special, business or economy, KLM pretend to be better than they really are, but generally the flights are ok. I wanted to book an award ticket and didn’t succeed as the app kept gave an error on the payment page. It kept doing it. So I tried to call them. To have them book it that way. As it’s an award ticket that has to be with their ‘Flying Blue’ desk. They were closed at that time. So I tried to use KLM’ WhatsApp option. No answer, till this very day. So I tried to book the ticket again the next morning, required points had gone up double!! So I try to call again to have the issue solved. Automatic disconnection of the call as waiting times to long the voice said. So I tried a day later, points gone up even higher. After 40 minutes finally got a hold of the FB desk. To have them tell me they can’t help me and the points required are what they are and I should have called earlier! They should have picked up the phone earlier they mean. What a terrible service and no solution offered. So their app doesn’t work as it should and you can’t get a hold of them and they don’t help and say you should have called earlier. They basically say, “tough luck and all not our fault, can’t and won’t help”. Very very disappointing and I will think twice before I book any ticket with KLM again. As service with the low cost companies is low, but so are their prices and KLM prices aren’t! Service is the same and sure no better. And this is how they treat their loyal customers. They don’t care.

### "cabin crew obviously did not care much"
Was seated next to a group of teenagers who were served alcohol, loitered in the aisles, and were rowdy; yelling and screaming. They did not wear any masks. This was never even asked by the cabin crew. I asked the cabin crew about checking their IDs, since I understood them when they excitedly talked about getting free beer. Nevertheless, they were served more alcohol without any check, despite the cabin crew doing so being full aware of me telling him and his colleagues about it. As we taxied in at Amsterdam, people opened the overhead compartments with the plane still in motion. No word from the cabin crew. I did it myself. And, as usual the in-flight entertainment audio or wi-fi did not work. In all, it turned out that any "order" on the KLM flight required me, as a paying customer, to solve as the cabin crew obviously did not care much. My faith in KLM is very low after trying them for two trips again for the first time in a few years.

### "patronizing and shouting at people"
Terrible. Flight was cancelled less than 4 hours before departure. Then we were put on a flight due to fly out 4 hours later, but that was then delayed by a further hour. We were asked to speak to counter staff at the gate to get seats together but the counter staff for 1430 AMS to Paris on 7 April seem to enjoy being rude, patronizing and shouting at people asking simple clarifying questions. KLM should investigate how passengers are treated by this group of women.

### "long-haul services suffer from excessive cost-savings"
Flew CPH-AMS-KGL with KLM on 2-3 April 2022. Both flights on time or early. Check-in online and again at desk in CPH was smooth (Sky Priority). Their internet interphase works nicely in every aspect with full access to the booking. Luggage was a bit overweight and was labelled “Heavy”. It was inscribed to final destination where it arrived in good order. Boarding / de-boarding were easy and on jetbridges, except at final destination where a bus took us 150 meter (no carbon prize!) from aircraft to arrival hall. I chose to travel to AMS a day earlier than strictly needed to be sure to catch my onward morning flight AMS to KGL. The trip became a relief due to full utilisation of gold card privileges. This trip costed me less than 500 USD, and the return legs still remains. Extremely good value for money – and it earns me 46 X-points toward retention of my elite status at KLM. Was given a huge luggage allowance, 2 x 23 kg) that I decided not to fully use. CPH->AMS Aircraft was a newer B737-8. Saturday evening flight, not many passengers – I got myself an entire 3-seats section. The service onboard was good and snacks and plenty of drinks were handed out generously (incl. wine and beer). Two-three drink rounds were provided within this 55 Minutes flight is fine. Call bells addressed instantly. Can’t fault this airline – as good as it gets in economy. Lounges on the way… KLM offers 2 lounge in CPH: the third-party lounges Carlsberg Aviator and Aviator Apartments. Both were nice, tidy, and airy. Good view of tarmac. The draft beers (3 kinds) in the Carlsberg lounge tastes for some reason better than those poured in town. Upon arrival to Amsterdam I chose the non-Schengen KLM Lounge 25, which was more than OK and presentable though no without any extravagancy. They closed at 10 p.m. For the night I found a sleeping area until morning where I went to the Sky Team “Lounge 52” in non-Schengen area. Impressive design, views. Amble space. Showers. Breakfast was outstanding with fresh, hot delicious breads. AMS->KGL A330-200 aircraft. Flight arrived on time, though departing 20 min. late. Smooth seating and embarking procedures. Onboard, I was greeted by name and offered an upgrade for 64k Flying Blue miles which I declined as economy offers amble space these days. Premium economy was offered for 14k, but the armrests can’t be lifted so economy is a better deal when economy is only 65% full. KLM provides only a single meal service on this 7 hours’ flight which is too little. While a lunch is served at 12 o’clock, there is no supper prior to landing in Kigali, where one has to deal with lengthy immigration and Covid-testing procedures. The food was passable. Drinks were served reluctantly and only offered upon firm requests or by walks to the galley. Bell for service calls were rarely addressed. Symptomatically, I was offered hot drinks only once on this long-haul flight. IFE has improved since last year and more options offered. Screens are tiny, less than half size of those on Qatar Airways and Emirates. It seems that KLMs long-haul services suffer from excessive cost-savings on services and attempt to reduce all kind of intakes to a bare minimum. However, for the modest ticket price paid, one can’t complain a lot.

### "I would definitely recommend KLM"
Not Verified |  The staff we encountered were all very friendly and attentive. My friend hadn't requested her special meal in time & the stewardess worked hard to try to find her something to eat. I was travelling with a young child and the cabin staff and pilot were all very friendly to her. We were provided with multiple drinks throughout the flight which helped as it is a long flight. I was surprised at the amount of food and snacks we were given and how high quality these were. The seats were comfortable and the plane looked clean. WiFi is chargeable, you get 30 minutes of messaging for free but no harm in switching off for a while. I would definitely recommend KLM to others.

### "I’m so helpless and wondering if there is any help out there"
I have a flight coming up on April 15, 2022 and honestly I am beginning to side with these reviews here that the KLM customer care/contact centre is terrible. I’m on the phone as I type this trying to get to them and I have been waiting for 53 minutes now. I don’t even think my request is this complicated as I just want to change my flight schedule. I called last week and an agent confirmed the change but mentioned that a recalculation would have to be done and that I would get an email after 24 hours. I waited for 72 hours without any feedback so I proactively reached out only to be told that we should be reaching out to our local KLM office for the change and was given a contact number which never gets answered for 24 hours straight so I called again and this time a third agent said it appears the first agent never sent any email for the recalculation and confirmed he has sent the email and that it will take 96 hours to hear back. I asked what if I don’t hear back after 96 hours and he replied I would have to call back. At this point, I am not really comfortable so I ask for a contact to the local office. He gave me another number to contact our local office which unsurprisingly doesn’t get answered. I finally was able to get through after some google search and this agent has no idea what is going on. I have to literally tell him my flight schedule and everything. I wonder if all the agents use the same system. It’s ridiculous and with the frequent long silence during the calls without any prompts, you wonder if the agents know what they are doing. At this point I’m so helpless and wondering if there is any help out there. In this day and age, customer care is everything and wondering why KLM isn’t taking theirs seriously. I am very very upset.

### "staff were friendly and competent"
Despite a delay of nearly 50 minutes from Geneva, we arrived at the scheduled time in Amsterdam. On this first flight or on the second (Amsterdam-New York), the flight and ground staff were friendly and competent. The planes were clean, the choice of films varied and recent, the food was sufficient and good (for airplane food, eh). The space between the rows is a bit small but we travel economy class so it's not outrageous. However, we have never been able to connect to wifi. Malgré un retard de près de 50 mn au départ de Genève, nous sommes arrivés à l’heure prévue à Amsterdam. Que ce soit sur ce premier vol ou sur le second (Amsterdam- New York), le personnel de bord et au sol était aimable et compétent. Les avions étaient propres, le choix des films varié et récents, la nourriture était en suffisance et bonne (pour de la nourriture d’avion hein). L’espace entre les rangées est un peu petit mais nous voyageons en classe économique, ce n’est donc pas scandaleux. Nous n’avons par contre jamais réussi à nous connecter au wifi.

### "KLM has the worst customer service of any airline"
At about 11.30pm on March 18th, I was notified that my flight from Amsterdam to Geneva at 12.20pm the next day (March 19th) was cancelled. Due to existing plans in Geneva that day, my only option for rebooking was at 7am — which meant that I needed to be at the airport at 5am. Needless to say, after packing and traveling to the airport, I didn't get more than an hour or two of sleep that night. It was awful. After arriving in Geneva, I received a notification that I could request compensation for the cancelled flight. So I followed the link and did that. I received a total of €269.12 back. Today, I received an email to check-in for my return flight from Geneva to Amsterdam (scheduled for tomorrow). When I followed the check-in process, I received an error that I needed to call KLM. When I called, they told me that when I applied for compensation from my previous flight cancellation, it automatically cancelled my return flight. KLM then told me that I would need to buy my return flight. Currently, that costs €1,659. So, to sum up: 1) KLM cancelled my flight 2) KLM offered €269.12 compensation then cancelled my return flight 3) KLM tells me I need to pay €1,659 for the return flight. I should also mention that I'm a KLM Flying Blue member with status and a KLM/Air France Amex card. After talking with customer service for an hour, they told me that there was nothing they could do. That the supervisors/team leads would not take my call. KLM has the worst customer service of any airline I have ever experienced. It's astonishingly bad.

### "I will never fly with them again"
I have flown between the UK and Kenya many times before with numerous other airlines, and KLM is the only one I would never fly with again. The only good thing I have to say about them is that the seats are OK and they have half-decent food. My initial flight from Leeds to Amsterdam was smooth enough (it was too short for them to mess up), but then the flight from Amsterdam to Nairobi was delayed by over an hour. We were not given any explanation beyond "unforeseen circumstances". I expressed concern to a stewardess about my connecting flight to Mombasa very soon after takeoff (I would have done so earlier but was ignored multiple times when I tried to get the attention of cabin crew members). She said it was too early to know if there would be an issue with me making my connecting flight and that we might make up a lot of time during the journey. However, when we landed, I had under an hour to get through passport control, collect my bags in Nairobi, go through customs, walk to Domestic Departures, go through security and get onto the plane! I expressed my concerns to another stewardess as I was leaving the flight, and she assured me that staff on the ground would help me. However, in practice, I ended up having to be proactive and beg members of staff for help. I ended up making it onto the connecting flight 10 minutes before departure purely through my own efforts. It was the last flight of the day. I do not know if I would have had any help from KLM had I missed it and been forced to spend the entire night in the airport in Nairobi. I had zero intimation from them that I would have received any kind of compensation or been booked into a hotel for the night. They completely washed their hands of me the moment I stepped off the plane. Absolutely appalling and despicable customer service, especially to a solo female traveller. Unfortunately, I booked a return flight, which means I'm stuck with KLM for one more journey, but after that, I will never fly with them again or recommend them to anybody else. I'm going to stick with Kenya Airways for my journeys between the UK and Kenya.

### "customer service has been terrible"
Not Verified |  My bag was lost and the customer service has been terrible. I filed my claim with KLM and the only thing they can tell me is that there is "no update. They cannot even find the bag. Nobody I speak to is able to call the airports my bag could potentially be in and ask them to look. They refuse to contact anybody on my behalf, so there is no way for me to know if anybody is even looking for my bag. They only say that their system will be updated when the bag is found. Well, how do I know you even have people looking? I have been more than three days with no update, and I leave in one day. No bag at all. KLM customer services hours are also limited, so you cannot continue to call for updates. Absolutely terrible.

### "We are extremely disappointed in KLM's customer service"
Our flight and return flight were both cancelled. We never received an update, alert or itinerary change. We only found out when trying to check in at the airport. It took us 3 phone calls before finally being able to talk to someone from KLM. They claimed that updates had been sent, however no message had reached our inbox or spam folder. In our online KLM portal on the website, the original flights were still scheduled! So how could we have known? After a very stressful day, we ended up getting on a next flight. Our meal that we had requested for dietary reasons, as well as our selected seats, were not available on this flight. For our return, they offered a different flight which would leave us with a full day layover in the Calgary airport. Or a flight a day later than planned. We had to decide quickly as the lady on the phone said we had to. We ended up selecting the flight one day later. After submitting a complaint for the lack of communication, they replied saying it was beyond their control and a compensation for our trouble, stress and having to rebook, was not possible. We are extremely disappointed in KLM's customer service and will not be booking through them again.

### "customer service is beyond terrible"
KLM's customer service is beyond terrible as my wife and I have been trying to get in touch with someone for over 2 weeks. We were overcharged for extra baggage over the course of last few weeks we have been bounced around with no resolution. They make it impossible to contact a human who will resolve an issue for a reason. This way the customer eventually gives up and they don't have to provide a refund. After using them more times than I can count in the past I can safely say we will never use KLM again.

### "cabin crew seemed to ignore me"
Not Verified |  I paid almost an extra 100$ to have a seat with additional leg-room, right behind the business class. Only problem was that the cabin crew seemed to ignore me. I ordered a small bottle of red wine in order to fall a sleep easier 4 times with 3 different cabin crew members but never got served. When I double checked the answer was: I'll bring it to you soon sir. After 2 hours of waiting I was sincerely fed up and accepted that it would not be happening anymore. Upon arrival in Stuttgart my Luggage was not there, which of course was the icing on the top. The fact that I take time to write this review perfectly displays how unsatisfied I was with this experience.

### "no effort find alternative routes"
Not Verified |  My food was terrible and inedible although service was good. Inflight entertainment also bad on both long-haul flights. But worse was inbound late arrival due to weather and just missed second connecting flight to Brussels (after travelling since 19.10 the day before). Was informed that my next flight would be nearly 8 hours later, email was sent whilst I was still in the air, so I didn't receive it until we had landed 20 minutes later, there was no inflight announcement and no ground staff who had any idea what was happening. I had to run halfway round the enormous airport only to find that the flight had just departed. And no effort was made to find alternative routes such as a train (I was now at Schipol). I wrote a complaint requesting some reimbursement but of course it was refused.

### "Poor troubleshooting skills"
Rude staff at check in told us we need to bag our kids’ sled so it would fit in the aircraft, which does not make sense since it would add more inches. It would require us to wait for a shop to open very close to our boarding time. We told her we would rather throw them away than miss our flights. She demanded that we put them in the trash immediately. We couldn’t find a bin that would fit them so we carried them along until boarding. All the aircrafts boarded us with no problems and were able to stow them under the seats with no problems. She was having a power struggle that day and took it on us. Poor troubleshooting skills.

### "customer service is an absolute horror"
Not Verified |  Their customer service is an absolute horror show! They cancelled my international flight on the day with an automated do-not-reply email and I spent the whole morning trying to get in touch with their customer service centre in vain. I ended up having to buy a new flight at the airport. They emailed me saying I would get a refund buy it's been three months and I've not heard from them.

### "I’m a big traveller and will never fly KLM again"
Not Verified |  Low to average flight March 2020, Montreal to Amman Jordan. Had an overland trip which went from Jordan to Egypt with a flight home from Cairo to Montreal a few weeks later. Got stuck in Amman Jordan due to start of pandemic. Had to pay to find a flight home from there as Amman Jordan airport closed within 48 hours. Took a credit instead of asking for a refund for Cairo to Montreal portion of trip. I was told that I could use the credit within 2 years. Am redoing this Jordan Egypt trip now but KLM said that I had to use the credit in 2021 when no travel was allowed! I’m taking the trip this March with British Airways. I’m a big traveller and will never fly KLM again.

### "the last time ever I fly with KLM"
KLM customer service is so bad. I bought an wifi onboard voucher and the whole flight have no internet connection. The WiFi is ok to connect but then it showed limited connection, no internet was provided. Asked the flight attendant and they said they don't know why but you should ask for a refund by yourself. Going to website, filling in booking code and last name and I got the answer that the flight / voucher has been used so request can not process? Contact KLM customer service, need to wait more than 45 mins so it didn't work, KLM Whatsapp chat send customer around with asking first for all kinds of personal info about back acc and said they will request for me and then say that they couldn't refund because the voucher has been used. This is the last time ever I fly with KLM.

### "Very disappointing experience"
Very disappointing experience with KLM. They charged me an extra $3500 for a first-class ticket, lost my luggage for 3 days, and then refused to refund even a few dollars for toiletries that I had to buy because I didn't file within 3 weeks (I filed in 4 because I was still on my trip). In an era of focusing on the customer, they have made sure that I will avoid KLM in the future.

### "Very efficient airline"
Very efficient airline with friendly service, decent seats, and food for short haul economy. Additionally, when I missed my connection and got lost in the airport, some check in desk people who were off the clock helped me get my vouchers in order which was very kind.

### "customer service so disappointing"
I had great flying experience through out my trip. How ever your customer service which I have been trying to get hold of for 38 days has been simply so disappointing and honestly disturbingly horrible that I will never fly with KLM again. They lost my bag in San Francisco 38 days ago. I filed claim then I kept calling spend 7 hours on hold! Then I filed restitution claim, tried WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messager and nd not once have any Customers service agent reached out to me.

### "agent essentially said tough luck"
Visited Tromsø, Noway (TOS) Dec 2021 to see Northern Lights. Checked into my return flights (TOS-BER, AMS-AAL) on Dec 29 online about 10am for a Dec 30 departure; and everything looked good. Midday on Dec 29 (ie less than 24 hours before departure) I got email that one of the flights (AMS-AAL) had been cancelled and that KLM were looking at options. We could not extend our hotel and could find no other hotel options in/near TOS (it is a relative small, and VERY remote town) so I immediately tried to contact KLM (Holland #) to determine flight options. I got an automated message that "We have more than 45 min wait time; please try your call later", and call was disconnected. For the rest of the day, I called about once an hour with same result. In the mean time (around 6pm) I got another automated email that they had rebooked my itinerary on Jan 2nd. This was complete useless for several reasons. There were no hotels to be had in TOS, and we had flight back to US on Jan 2nd that we would miss. Finally that evening I called KLM # in US and was put into a call que. After 1.5 hour wait (at huge long distance fee), I got through to an agent and explained situation, and the agent essentially said "tough luck". KLM would not help find hotels in TOS, nor help us get out of town; eg if KLM had left my first two flights intact we would get to AMS, with lot better chance of finding a hotel and there were several options to get to AAL from AMS the following day, but KLM would not budge. I then asked KLM to switch me to nearly destination airport (BLL instead of ALL) and we could take a 2 hour train ride from BLL to ALL. KLM's own system showed such a flight with 7 seats available on Dec 30. However, KLM wanted more than $1000/ticket to make the change. When I insisted that KLM do something to help us out - leaving us stranded in TOS for 2 days without hotel rooms, wasn't really an option, they hung up on me. In we end we ended up buying completely separate ticket on different airline (SAS) at $500/ticket for Dec 30, and we are now fighting with KLM about getting a refund, which a different (and also not a happy story) What really got to me, was that KLM had several good options that they would have deployed:  KLM had a flight on Dec 30 to a nearly airport that would work, but they wanted completely unrealistic change fee (around $1000/ticket). They could have put us on the Dec 30 SAS flight (cost about $500/ticket) - same flights that we purchased ourselves. They could have flown us to AMS on Dec 30 and put us up for one night and completed journey next day) - I would even have been willing pay to hotel, however, they cancelled complete itinerary without talking to me and refused to reinstate the TOS-AMS portion

### "TAP automatically rebooked us on a KLM flight"
When we arrived at the Madrid airport the morning of January 29, 2022, we presented all relevant documentation including passports, proof of COVID vaccinations, negative COVID tests per Lisbon’s requirements, and documentation of recovery per the United States’ requirements. We arrived at the gate (E69) at approximately 5:30 am and were told that our flight was canceled due to severe weather and that TAP automatically rebooked us on a KLM flight for the following day, January 30, 2022. As we had not received an email or other notice communicating the new itinerary, I asked the agent for an itinerary with our new flight information. I also expressed my concerns regarding covid documentation requirements for our new connection in Amsterdam as I had only prepared documentation for a connection in Lisbon, Portugal. While sympathetic to our situation, he informed me that he was unable to provide additional information or print off our itinerary and instructed us to speak with an agent at the KLM service counter (where passengers can check baggage). Per his suggestions, we went to the KLM desk at approximately 6:15 am. After communicating our situation to the agent at the service counter, we were subjected to non-compliant behaviors by the agent. Inability and reluctance to provide pertinent information to us regarding our travel reservation. When I requested our new itinerary, she stated “the counter is closing I will not do that.” I informed her that the agent at gate E69 directed us to this counter for help. She continued to say that there are no more flights and that she did not need to be there. After continuously expressing that we were auto booked and don’t even know our flight numbers, she reluctantly printed our itinerary. Furthermore, we communicated that we did not know the travel documentation requirements for Amsterdam. However, she only stated that the US requires a negative COVID test. We showed her our passports, negative antigen tests, and documentation of recovery. She was unwilling to tell us what documents were needed for our route. As part of the US entry requirements, we were prepared with official documentation of recovery documents that met the CDC guidelines. These documents were verified by multiple travel agencies and licensed physicians and met all requirements for documentation of recovery. She refused to acknowledge that these met the US guidelines and stated “No. It is my rule, I decide what is accepted and what is not accepted. This will not be accepted.” When we offered to show her the CDC checklists for airlines, she threatened to cancel our booking and began scanning our passports into the computer. Refusal to escalate the issue to her superiors or identify herself as a KLM employee. As the discussion escalated, we asked to speak with another agent or supervisor. She refused to contact anyone else. We said we needed help, that our flight was canceled and that we needed information about our new route. She stated, “I am closing the counter this isn’t my problem.

### "never recommend this airline"
Not Verified | I had to cancel my flight back in December 2020 due to covid. This has been an absolute nightmare. Its now almost the end of 2022 and I still see no refund in sight. And whenever I pester them for updates it's always the same "request pending" even when I send all the required documents and then some. During this covid pandemic I have had to cancel flights with Ethiopian Airways and Qatar Airways and always got my refund within 30days, and that was with the covid wait. I don't know what KLM excuse is but for this reason I would never recommend this airline or ever fly it ever again.

### "did not seem to care for their passengers"
Flying business class is often more than triple the price of some airlines, even on direct flights. Staff service is often mediocre, no choice of meal, selection of drinks limited and quite often not available. I booked economy but on check in I was able to purchase an upgrade for a fee which included lounge access and pre-boarding. Seats and seat pitch are good, even for someone over 1.90 meters, middle seat was empty. Service was not great, to say the least. Staff was not very attentive, they did not seem to care for their passengers. A small meal was provided minutes after take-off, but … in a box. Horrible presentation. I know that there are different opinions about this, but I think it looks shabby, given the business class fare. Staff disappeared after the meal service. Overall, a flight (2.15 h) that gave me very mixed feelings, but perfectly on time. I would certainly not consider KLM if I had to pay a full fare. Even the upgrade fee was, in hindsight, too much. Travel time with a transfer elsewhere might take a few more hours but if you are not in a hurry, what is the issue? I prefer quality and KLM does not provide that on intra-European flights.

### "online refund service rejected my request"
I booked the flight via KLM on Nov 18th 2021. Because of Covid issues I tried to cancel. The online refund service rejected my request saying it wasn't a KLM booking. After hours of trying, I finally managed to speak to an agent and explained my situation. She said she would sort. It is now Jan 18th 2022. Not only have I not received a refund, I have received a message saying my flight time has had to be changed. Thus I now know my flight has still not been cancelled. I've tried again to speak to an agent. All I could do was make this request using Messenger. Two days later, I have not had a reply. If you have to use this airline I suggest you book via an agency such as Booking.com. They actioned other cancellations of flights and hotels I had to make in no time at all. When it comes to customer support, KLM are awful.

### "recommend for sure not to use this airline"
If I could give 0 stars I would do it. The service is horrible, with no qualified people working. If you are new, please first teach your co worker and after let him serve good and qualified costumer service. Food is terrible too. I will recommend for sure not to use this airline.

### "The whole trip has been terrible"
Absolutely terrible. My flight was cancelled and I was put on another one with a shorter connection time. As with the outbound leg, I had to check-in using the Air France website because the KLM one wouldn’t let me. There was no welcome drink or a pre-meal drink, nothing until the meal service. Even the crew have been told not to talk to the passengers much. In business class the meal was a 1 tray small meal, about what you would expect in economy. The stewardess got me some nut and nibbles so I could feel as though I had had something. You have to use their headphones as they have changed all the connectors to a 3-point magnetic style. I don’t blame the cabin crew, they are just under instructions. I needn’t have worried about my connection as that flight was cancelled as well with the weather, even though others were flying. This was at 7am and they were going to put me on the 4pm flight as the 12.25pm was “fully booked”. When I complained a seat on the 12.25pm flight miraculously appeared. On the plane the seats to my right and left were empty. On the way out not long after the meal finished all the crew disappeared and I had to go back to economy to find someone to get a me glass of wine and she said the rest had probably gone to bed. What if there had been an emergency? The whole trip has been terrible as far as the KLM flights were concerned and after 31 years and Platinum status that was my last trip with them as I have had enough.

### "a very relaxed trip"
Another good job by KLM. Booked a few days before departure, so price was rather high. But we got the Embraer 190 which is one of my favourites because of the 2-2 seating and the legroom. The latter was even better on the outbound flight, since we got an emergency exit row without paying for it. Qr-checks at Schiphol rather straight forward nowadays, so no long waiting, but it was a quiet Wednesday evening between Christmas and New Year. On time flight, two drinks, a rather dull cheese sandwich and a brownie and an early landing in Valencia made this a very relaxed trip. Inbound flight pretty much the same. Disembarking at Schiphol rather slow, since taxiing takes quite a long time. This - combined with a bus transfer - takes 40 minutes (from landing to terminal). Valencia was much better: we were in the terminal within 20 mins after landing.

### "intended to take the second leg"
First, the second leg of my flight was canceled, and rescheduled to a day later. This would be ok except I would have a 24 hour layover in a city where I cannot leave the airport due to covid rules. I missed my first flight and figured they would reschedule me no problem, because on their website they said they have flexible policies for booking due to covid; that was a lie. I called customer service who then told me to call back the next day and hung up on me. I called again, got another person and was hung up on again. Finally I booked a flight with another airline; £175 later! I called customer service once more to let them know I still intended to take the second leg of my flight which was still scheduled next day. They said I have to pay another €125 as a rescheduling fee! In addition to this they said a voucher or refund was not an option either! People miss flights all the time, and they had 3 flights I could’ve easily been rebooked to THAT day but wasn't!

### "they always invent some new checks"
KLM are bad. That’s my 2nd flight and they always invent some new checks, don’t give you important information about gates or destination terminal. It’s very confusing. Last time they made us run to our transfer, although they knew we would not get it (they didn't even load our baggage to that flight). Amsterdam airport staff are extremely unfriendly and unhelpful. The food is horrible, worse than any other company I have flown with.

### "most stressful traveling experience"
I am very disappointed in the service provided by KLM. They did not show any concern for my first flight arriving late and making me miss my connection flight. What is worse is how they then charged me for another PCR test that I have taken already. The employees are not even sure of the directions they give you and ultimately they waste more time and extort as much from you as they can. This has been an eye-opening experience that I will never forget. After this, I will never fly KLM Royal Dutch airlines again. This review is not hostile but rather a reminder of one of my most stressful traveling experiences.

### "saying that we can't change our seats"
My partner and I changed our seats during the flight (from 36 A and B to 40 D and E). Row 36 was completely full, instead, row 40 was empty. We did it because I wasn't feeling very well, I am pregnant and was nauseous so wanted to be closer to the lavatory. The flight attendant approached us by literally saying: "What is your story?". He did not let us explain anything and just kept saying that we can't change our seats without his permission. My partner kept said "We are sorry, we apologize", all the people around turned to see how this man is yelling at us. He wanted to send us back but in the meantime, someone else sit on our seats. I understand our mistake about asking permission to move to another seat, but his reaction was aggressive.

### "I will not fly ever again with KLM"
Outdated check in processes and software. KLM app is not working. Despite their email saying it is a seamless process with a digital boarding pass, it is impossible to get a digital pass. I had to wait through the 25’ drop off queue to get my pass printed. The Hungarian airport staff is rude and aggressive and unhelpful as well. There is no “check in here” link in any of the emails I received before the flight but those are full of unrelated information that you get lost by it. Those emails are absolutely useless. Once I found a link it brought be to the Air France home page instead of KLM’s. Astonished how bad they are. Also, the requirements for check in are so absurdly long and overwhelming, you need to upload all kind of documents and information even about your arrival day covid test, even though you have not had yet the results. Then the questions were asked again when I received the boarding pass. when arrived at Amsterdam for Transfer, there is an useless self transfer service, I would have expected that the airline would have aligned their flights, but no! The bus dropped me at the other end pf the airport from my gate to London, but I also didn’t know which gate it was as there were no board with flight information where the bus dropped me. I had to run through the normal terminal and queue for passport control again! this is unbelievable, if there wouldn’t have been one guard with a good heart and let me in front of the queue, I would have missed my transfer flight. I was sweating like a pig as I run a mile to the gate. There I told the airport crew that this is such a bad organization and I almost missed my flight. She arrogantly replied by asking: “but you didn’t did you? !” What a disgusting attitude! And I just read the negative reviews after my bad experience. I will not fly ever again with KLM.

### "Didn't load my luggage in Amsterdam"
Didn't load my luggage in Amsterdam. Found out in Las Vegas. Had no hand luggage or anything since they forced me to check it in Munich. Was stranded with nothing for an entire day. They didn't help at all. When I finally got my luggage it was damaged and the inside of my suitcase destroyed. No compensation but the run around. Never again!

### "KLM need some rejuvenation and innovation"
Flew KGL-EBB-AMS-CPH 20 December 2021. First 2 legs on A330-200 business class while the last was on an Embraer-190 in Economy. Travel preparations went smooth. An early announced cancellation postponed my travel 1 day which was fine – I also modified it further to ensure amble time in AMS in my new favorite KLM lounge at Gate 52. I had a cheap Economy ticket but decided to upgrade by Miles at check-in in Kigali Airport. To my surprise it was very easy and quick – paid 75600 miles (KGL-EBB-AMS). Lounge in Kigali was Pearl Lounge: acceptable, spacious, good savory snacks, hot foods, and uncrowded. Drink supply of very poor options – the provisions are degrading more and more since 2018. Lack of quality mitigated by quantity – liquid enough was present – even for the thirsty. I even had a shower and was given the amenities for it (towels, kit, etc.). Boarding included a ridiculous early call from the lounge to sit and stare in gate for 45 Minutes prior to an awkward, superfluous bus-gating for 300 meter, degrading business class feeling to cattle class. Upgrade was worth it as the plane was overly full due to X-mas. Only 2 seats left in business and had to change seat in EBB (from 1A to 2B) in a 2x2x2 straight configuration. That was fine for me. Aircraft old – and the hard and soft product including the FA’s was in general was a bit retro old-fashioned, but acceptable and solid, though conform. FAs on KLM are very firm limiting to surly and arrogant, having forgot what true service, customer care, positivism, and respect is. First leg, 40 Minutes, offered only champagne and a drink round. No options of beer apart from the imposed monopolizing Heineken brand. Snacks offered were industrial prepacks, one worse than the other. Seat lie flats, big monitors, and IFE offerings were very limited but functioning – incl. noise reduction headsets provided. Wi-Fi offered for payment up to 30 EUR in business class- a disgracing rip-off. Food and drink offerings acceptable, not world class. Breakfast in a tray without any exotic offerings. Tea is a joke, they provide a teabag which you have to put into lukewarm water – eventually becomes only 50-60 degrees hot which can’t do any tea any justice – should be boiled with the leaves. Coffee below all standards. Amenity kit were given out, though boring composition, not worth to take along. Lounge 52 in Amsterdam is very good – I spent easily 4 hours there and got service from the KLM helpdesks. They recovered a lost luggage tag within 1 Minute. Next flight AMS-CPH was delayed 80 Minutes which is unacceptable. They changed Aircraft in last Minute. Had a reasonable experience in Economy with full service despite full. I do like the Embraer aircraft. Luggage in CPH quickly delivered in intact condition. KLM need some rejuvenation and innovation – they are getting outdated but are solid and has never really let me down.

### "No customer service at all"
Not Verified | Birmingham to Helsinki via Amsterdam. KLM has had its flights delayed 8/8 times I have flown with them in the past year. First I lost my connection flight and despite being delayed 6h I got no compensation. Then the got my luggage stuck in Amsterdam, I got that back next day. Flying back to UK they broke my luggage. Next time flying to Finland the lost my luggage. No customer service at all. Really bad company

### "customer service is unbelievable"
The food was disgusting, the cabin crew not much better with their untidy appearance. The customer service is unbelievable. I would like is a Refund of my £45 for two seats i reserved and were never allocated to us. Phoned six times, never got and satisfaction until today after waiting a hour girl said she was putting me through to the refund department. I thought finally getting somewhere and then they hung up, I'm so angry.

### "Just a miserable day"
My flight was an hour late that made me skip my connection. After a lot of bouncing around the Amsterdam airport I have found T4. It was a machine that printed me out the tickets for tomorrow and a hotel voucher. At that point on some reason it felt like I didnt want to go to any hotel. It felt miserable. It took me couple hours just to calm myself down Some of my fellow unlucky passengers felt the same way because I’ve seen them sitting around not going to the hotel and talking how Bad it was. Just a miserable day

### "the agents are not helpful"
They have no customer service, nobody will solve any kind of problem you have, nobody answers the phone. It is a shame of a company. I have been having problems and I am not able to reach out to the company, the 2 times I got on the phone they answered to me after 1.40 hs of waiting, the agents are not helpful.

### "worst catered flights I have ever been on"
Definitely the worst catered flights I have ever been on. Although flying cattle class I was expecting a standard of catering at least equal to other airlines. This was way below. No drinks were offered before the meal, only beer soft drinks or wine with the meal and nothing after. Unfortunate as perhaps a decent drink might have numbed the disappointment in the pathetic food offered. First was the awful "vegetarian sandwich". We were offered this three times altogether on the return flight, a dry, stale scrambled egg sandwich with an nasty aftertaste of mustard. No alternative offered. As for the main meal, the first was a tasteless quinoa salad, mac and cheese with a small block of cheddar. On the return chicken and broccoli with disgusting slimy so called mashed potatoes. Breakfast on both legs was just a microwaved concoction like pizza and nothing else, no fruit, no juice, no alternative whatsoever. Entertainment was very limited compared to that offered by BA, Virgin, Emirates and Air New Zealand, the airlines I have last flown with and WiFi was chargeable Frankly we won't be flying KLM ever again. If you are trying to choose please use any alternative.

### "Short two hour flight with implacable service"
Short two hour flight with implacable service. Check in at the airport was very fast and speedy due to the flight being full I received an email stating I could check my bag in for free, which I did. During the flight a sandwich was served along with drinks, there was no inflight entertainment onboard nor wifi regardless I had some shows downloaded on my phone. Upon arriving in Amsterdam I got lost and the flight purser went out of her way to helping me which was greatly appreciated. Definitely have The Flying Dutchman on my eyes for another flight in the near future.

### "two flawless flights"
KLM is starting to become my favourite airline. Again two flawless flights: Amsterdam-Bonaire and Curaçao-Amsterdam. One of the best things: ground staff (well, in Amsterdam, definitely not in Curaçao) en crew. We were greeted at Schiphol by a very friendly lady, who made a chat. Due to Covid checks we were advised to check in at least 3 hrs before our flight, but we were at the gate within 30 minutes. We decided to treat ourselves to lounge access for 100 euro in total. KLM's Crown Lounge is okay, but not sure I would do it again. Boarding in groups and punctual departure. Tasty meals - although a bit small - and enough drinks. I like the fact that they have a self service with drinks and snacks in the pantry. Very friendly crew. We were on the very last row in J and K, which is the only row in the 777 economy that had two seats. We liked that very much, because there is no-one beside you and you have more lag space. And in times of Covid at least it feels more safe since there is no-one behind you. Highly recommended! Quite a long trip to Bonaire since there is a stop in Aruba, but no big deal. Early landing in Bonaire and in about 30 minutes through customs despite Covid checks which were well arranged at the airport. Return flight pretty much the same experience, including the last row (apart from ground staff).

### "What a nightmare"
What a nightmare. Air France cancels my flight and schedules a flight that overlaps the next leg which means we will not make the connecting flight to JFK. Worse part is I cannot get ahold of anyone. I booked thru KLM. Called and would get an auto response after many prompts that the wait time is more than 45 mins so I am disconnected and instructs me to call back or go to their web site with all these great tools. Called back several times and the same response. Went to the web site and states I cannot reschedule my flight and to call their service line. Air France is worse. On hold for an hour multiple times then I get disconnected and the response tells me they can't help me right now. So I call back at 3:30am thinking it will be slower and I can get through. No-go. Recording states their call center is closed. I depart in 10 days and I have no way of getting this fixed. Never had a leg rescheduled that conflicted with the full route. Get your systems logic fix and stop using Covid as an excuse of providing terrible service.

### "good if everything works properly"
It was a nice trip, the staff is trained well. The hotline for rebooking don't work at all nobody picked the call after 8x 30 min waiting time. Airline is good if everything works properly. The loyalty program for customers is fair.

### "Save yourself problems and avoid KLM"
Not Verified |  First a super long waiting line for checking 2 hours, people where furious because some missed their flight. The people at the front desk, couldn't recognize a Tourist visa from Mexico to the US, i stayed 30minin the front desk trying to convince them my documents were legitimate, i even had to google it to show them how a visa looks like! That's already 2:30hrs lost and obviously people behind me, very upset as i was. Everything in flight was ok but i was expecting more, considering this is a partner with Delta and that's how i got this ticket. Arriving to LAX, they lost my luggage with all my personal stuff and clothes, 3 days to get it back. Now I'm 6 weeks after submitting my refund, no email feedback so i decided to call because I'm not even finding my case online, I've been in line for 40min and no answer still. Save yourself problems and avoid KLM.

### "I will use them again soon I hope"
I flew Glasgow to Budapest return via Amsterdam for a weekend trip. Flights to and from GLA/AMS were on Cityhopper. Embraers are great aircraft for the short flight and the 2x2 seating is nice. AMS to BUD rtn were on KLM mainline 737s. Again seat was comfortable for the short flights. Transferring at AMS can be a real pain but that isn’t KLM’s fault. Cabin crew on mainline and cityhopper were very polite and professional; mainline crew have the edge though and it is nice to see the stripes on their uniforms identifying seniority. Free beer/wine and soft drinks on all flights is very welcome. Sandwich given on both flights too which was fine for short flight. Although we purchased light ticket which didn’t include checked luggage- checkin at both GLA and BUD were happy to check our bags free of charge. KLM are a fantastic airline with lovely staff and I will use them again soon I hope.

### "never know what you are going to get"
KLM is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get. Flight LCY - AMS got cancelled, which was a big negative and ruined my plans for the day. However, KLM promptly rebooked me on an earlier flight with BA. This leg with BA was quite enjoyable. The KLM Crown lounge at AMS was amazing, possibly, the most well-designed lounge I’ve been to : huge, yet cozy and has a great quiet area. The leg from AMS to SVO was nice, although with a pinch of salt. On one hand, the latest Recaro seats were very comfortable (even though being the same Economy seats), food was okay (although no better), crew monitored mask-wearing strictly and the purser was very nice and extremely helpful. On the other hand, soft product was very limited. No blankets and pillows (i understand it was only a 3-hour flight however, it was a red-eye arriving at 2am at SVO), no pre-departure drinks, no amenity kits. I was disgusted by one crew’s attitude. One of the passengers asked her something and instead, she rudely and in a clearly discriminating way demanded him to show his boarding pass to prove he was indeed in business class, no apology whatsoever. If i were that passenger, I would have filed a huge complaint to the airline. All in all, I am not complaining given that the flight was relatively cheap (£200 one way + €99 upgrade to business). However, I saw that KLM usually prices the AMS - SVO tickets similar to Aeroflot (c.£1,400 round trip), which has a million miles superior product and thus, for such a price, I would deem an experience to be completely unacceptable.

### "extra legroom seats were comfortablev"
Easy check in at Berlin even though we arrived very early. The plane was 2x2 and the extra legroom seats were comfortable. We had a small pack of chips on board but had wine too. Pilot caught up even though plane departed late. Good experience.

### "special meal requests are not attended to"
Oct 30th was our fourth flight to Curacao. Flight attendants absolutely marvellous. But the customer service on earth is the worst I ever met on any of the about 10 airlines I have booked in the last 20 years. Especially their website. It needs hours to find special info. Our special meal requests (esp. gluten free for me) once set in our Flying Blue accounts have disappeared. On the website, you are linked into nowhere or into a roundabout when you want to settle it. As we won't have dubious software on our laptops and therefore stun Messenger, Whatsapp & Cie, there is no other possibility than writing emails. But they are never answered let alone followed. On every inflight, our special meal requests are not attended to. For the return, we have to go to the not-so-far KLM office in Hato and ask for our meals at the counter. A shame for an Airline which keeps shouting on their ads: "We Care"!

### "The food was repulsive"
Not Verified |  The flight for economy class was improved as most people had their single row of 3 and 4 seats to themselves when travelling solo, this was good as allowed laying down on the 13hrs flight. However, there was limited offer of trolley service for even soft drinks - only 3 times on entire flight and not even water left if you were sleeping during that trolley visit. Cabin staff were very polite and professional, announcements were minimal and promotional adverts only during boarding and deplaning at the gates. The food was repulsive, with the main course being some sort of fine noodles with a washed out seafood taste - not edible for me. The breakfast thing with something green in the scrambled egg roll was to me a repulsive smell and taste - plus more of that washed out fish base perhaps. The S. African red wine was delicious - I will be looking for CApe brand in the wine shop and wine section at supermarkets. The food was so poor in economy that if KLM economy travelled again I will my buy food before boarding. The seats were very firm, too firm for long haul and as very empty flight that I found the seats to be super uncomfortable to lie on due to seat belt fastenings projecting above seat. The movie selection was very poor, full of outdated and poor quality movies.

### "the worst customer experience"
We flew from Bucharest to Ibiza with a layover in Amsterdam. First of all, we departure with a delay because the flight was overbooked and then upon landing, the cabin crew informs us we have missed our connection flight to Ibiza because of the delay. I even see that in the KLM mobile app and I get a text message on my phone confirming we've missed out flight. Getting out of the plane, we decide to still go at the gate and see that we really missed out flight, since anyway it was the last flight to Ibiza that day. And guess what, we did not miss the flight. The gate was still open and we were able to board our flight to Ibiza. Upon landing, I get again an email and a text message letting me know that our baggage was not transferred and it will arrive in Ibiza after 24 hours and we each can spend up to 100 euros to buy the necessities and the extra costs will be refunded by KLM. I've submitted this claim on the 8th of September and since then called 10 times different numbers, followed up on my request via the KLM website and never heard back. Everyone I'm talking to on the phone does not know how to help me and nobody replies via email. I've contacted KLM via phone, email, WhatsApp number, Facebook. I even called the number in France for AirFrance's main customer service and nobody can help. This is very frustrating and the worst customer experience.

### "stewards and stewardesses were simply amazing"
We were on flight KL0591 from Amsterdam to Johannesburg on 21 October and on Flight 0592 from Johannesburg to Amsterdam on 6 November. We were a party of 4 adults and 1 baby of 1 years and 3 months. The KLM stewards and stewardesses were simply amazing. They went out of their way to help us with the baby, were very involved with the baby's well-being, etc. They were all very professional, but still friendly. They handled the Covid-19 restrictions with a firm hand which made us felt safe and well looked after. One lady in particular was the embodiment of professional service. We fly 20 to 20 times per year and with many different airlines, but the personnel on these two flights showed again that KLM is the best airline in the world.

### "changed my flight destination"
KLM changed my flight destination from Buenos Aires to Asuncion without my agreement. I have the next flight the same day from Buenos Aires. No explanations, no refunds. Support only sends copy paste excuse.

### "overall experience is below Ryanair"
Not Verified |  The check-in service was The worst experience i had for years. The ground staff especially The manager was rude. They set up The check-in in a way that normal customers were forming a queue at the very extreme left of an alley while priority clients would have a direct access to the two sole desks available. The two sole desks were checking in the priority people arriving in front of them. Normal clients had to wait 20 minutes before being called. People got so frustrated that naturally they started to wait inside the alley to be closer to the two sole desks. A lady acting like a manager pushed everybody back to the waiting point. I had the nerve to tell to that lady that we were become frustrating. We have been told that we were not a priority. Message received! The overall experience was to make you feel frustrated and envious. It so obvious that it becomes obscene and ridiculous. It is the last time i take this company. The overall experience is below Ryanair on its worst day. I will focus on companies doing their best to make you feel welcome and not creating unnecessary tensions.

### "My luggage never arrived"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience. I was flying with KLM in Business class. My luggage never arrived and i fill out a missing form report. Next day i got a text saying my luggage is on the way to Amsterdam and they apologise. When i checked online on the worldtracking website it says that my luggage is in Brazil (I did not fly to Brazil so i have no idea). A few days later and my luggage is still missing. I called them a few times and i keep getting the same answer 'Your luggage shown in Brazil but we cannot find it'. In the meantime i received a message from Avianca saying that they have accidently found my luggage in Bogota! As a business class passenger and a silver member with KLM I found the experience dreadful. I will not be flying again anytime soon.

### "pay 75 Euros for 3.8 excess weight"
KLM could not care less about their travellers. Despite traffic in airports are still very low, I have been asked to pay 75 Euros for 3.8 excess weight on the 23 kg allowance. I removed one item and I was still 1.9 kg above. I was still required to pay 75 euros. Supervisor told me that I need to read the rules. I tell them they need to find other customers because I will never take this airline again. To provide the full Picture the cost of one way exceeded 359 euros

### "genuinely care about their passengers"
Not Verified |  I missed my flight for Amsterdam to attend my sister's graduation. I called KLM Customer Service and they were so gracious! They guided me through the whole process with minimal fee. I can tell that they genuinely care about their passengers, special thanks to Charissa, I am truly grateful that you were the one who answered my call, you made my entire year.

### "KLM doesn't care"
Always a check-in and boarding disaster with KLM. They have more employees on duty than any other airline and yet manage to be the most inefficient. Even with Priority check-in you will wait at Schipol for 20 minutes with only two persons in front of you. No one seems to know their job well. Then there is the gate disaster. Rather than board in an orderly manner like a proper airline, they force a mass crowding line for everyone in prior it's at the gate. That is half the airplane pushing and shoving. Forget a fast line and courtesy for first/business class. KLM doesn't care. On this particular flight, all the same. Also they didn't call people up for standby or upgrades. I actually went though the gate and was puzzled why my Delta one upgrade wasn't issued. I had to go back to the desk and make her look up my name. Oh, she said, here you go. Really? Then she mad me go back in line with my new boarding pass. Truly a bunch of useless people and poor management. No wonder they are the worst major airline in Europe. And Europe has terrible airlines.

### "Badly organised in Vienna."
Booked assistance for my 84-year old mother. Badly organised in Vienna. Since we were not able to check in online with only hand luggage, the whole advantage of travelling light, went up in smoke. At the desk the assistance request was unknown so we had to wait for 20 minutes for a wheelchair 'somewhere near the window'. Once the wheelchair arrived it was fine. Whisked through the very busy security and to the gate. Plane was delayed by almost an hour. First on board on our premium economy seats. They are supposed to have more legroom but I was unable to compare. Friendly crew served a sandwich and two drinks. Information in English only which is effective, but typical Dutch: we don't care much about our language. Would be unthinkable with Air France for example. On landing in Amsterdam only 20 minutes late we were supposed to deplane row by row, but that doesn't work. Greeted at the gate by a very friendly guy with wheelchair. All in all okay.

### "They don't do what they promise"
Not Verified |  Their Platinum service has decreased terribly the last 1-2 years. They don't do what they promise, you cant get them to upgrade over the phone with miles, but tell you it can be done at the airport when flying back, which was not the case. They change a ticket even if told not to touch it. Also they never refunded 25.000 miles on a ticket that was changed/cancelled (by them) KLM used to have great Platinum service, but not anymore.

### "impossible to check in online"
First, it was impossible to check in online. 2nd, due to the inability to do online check ins, the queue was very long. 3rd, someone from our travel group was put on standby. We noted at least 7 people on standby. This is bewildering - the autumn holidays is known to everyone including KLM, yet this airline chooses to over book at this time. The air crew was polite and nice though.

### "time moved back without informing us"
I received from KLM misleading SMS and Messenger information about the delayed departure time (delay by 3,5 hrs). So we came 2 hrs before the new time, but missed the flight, since the departure time moved back without informing us. There was at least 10 other passengers in the same situation. This information let to a lot of frustration, disappointment about the KLM non existing service, hardly any sleep overnight on the Schiphol airport sitting on bench till my next Easyjet flight (I was so lucky to take last from 3 empty seats). Not speaking about the hopeless efforts to communicate with KLM artificial intelligence (to wish) until now. It would be nice if KLM provides passengers with full and reliable info, so that this doesn’t happen.

### "good value for money"
Not Verified | Flew Copenhagen to Kigali via Amsterdam on my birthday 13th Oct. 2021. Both flights on time or early. Luggage handled perfectly and smoothly. Check-in at desk in CPH smooth (Sky Priority) but other passengers had long waiting times. Lounges provided prior to both departures. Boardings / deboardings were easy and on jetbridges, except when leaving at final destination. Leg 1: CPH-AMS In Copenhagen airport, lounge was provided to Aviators’ Atelier Relaxium Business Lounge – hard name to remember. Surprisingly, it was open even at these inhuman ultra-early morning hours from 05 a.m. The lounge was good with solid buffet breakfast, mainly cold, tasty sandwiches on newly baked, hot bread, “rundstykker”. Aircraft was a well maintained B737-8. Despite being full, the service onboard was granted smoothly, including a good variety of snacks and cold and hot drinks. To my surprise, KLM had learned that I had birthday and congratulated me by name in front of other passengers in the fully packed aircraft. They then provided a handwritten, personal greeting and gave me a bottle of champagne on a tray with a design glass. Nice touch and icebreaker in an otherwise cold, surly, silent, morning atmosphere at 6 a.m. Lounge in Amsterdam provided was the KLM Sky Team “Lounge 52” in non-Schengen area. Very, very impressive design, views. Spacious was incredible. Must be the biggest lounge in Europe with 1500 seats? The drinks and dining was not up to the lounge appearance. No Asian dishes available, even noodles. Only one beer brand is offered in the entire lounge: Heineken – they must have paid a lot for this monopoly? 1st floor a la carte restaurant (food for purchase) while downstairs all the buffets and bars and other “areas” dominates. Leg 2: AMS-KGL On an A330 ageing plane. Flight arrived on time, though departing 20 min. late. Smooth seating and embarking procedures. Was greeted by name. Elite status and some ground work in Lounge with KLM eventually earned me an entire row for myself (4 seats) which was appreciated in an almost full plane though IFE was not working in that row. IFE was poor, old, and many passengers could not make it work. WiFi was present but neither really useful nor accessible. FAs were walking around in raincoats making them sweat, ridiculous, slow, and uncomfortable. Two hot meals were provided within this 8-hours trip. Food quality was substandard, just palatable. I had prepaid a special “Celebration Meal” which was delivered to perfection, but the food quality was not up to specifications and turned out to be just palatable. The meal costed me 35 USD which was not worth it as I was consequently, unknowingly deprived of the standard meals as for other passengers. Drinks were provided from trolley but not really flowing, and, outside meal service times, only if passengers actively requested them were they accessible. Coffee, tea and deserts were also of poor quality. In conclusion KLM is still a legacy carrier. The trip provided good value for money as I paid only 500 USD for the ticket (t/r), returning a couple of days prior to X-mas.

### "rude and ignorant cabin staff"
Not Verified |  Worst service I ever had. I upgraded my flight to business class hoping to get a comfortable flight. Instead I felt like I'm traveling a budget airline. Despite cabin being half full, attendants were always busy with something else except passengers. No welcome drink was offered, like other airlines do. After I asked for it, flight attendant brought me only part of what I asked, saying "I didn't know you asked for something else". Empty glasses were removed after almost 4 hours sitting on my table. I didn't get a breakfast before landing, per flight attendant "because you were slipping at that time", but I saw staff passed me 4 or 5 times. When I asked for a breakfast I was told that we do not have anything except some leftovers (wonder where food has gone). Food itself looked like a fastfood. Overall impression: rude and ignorant cabin staff, avoid KLM.

### "8000 rupees for additional baggage"
Not Verified |  The customer service was horrible at the airport counter during check in at the Delhi Airport. I had a backpack and laptop bag which were way under the allowed weight limits. My back pack was a hiking backpack that could be folded in half and clipped together if there were less content in the bag. Since I was carrying only a few things I had folded and clipped the backpack. They opened it up, stretched it and measured the backpack which was then a couple cms more than the allowed height. I asked them that I could fold the bag cause it was almost empty and they said that the 'original' size of the bag should be considered which did not make sense at all. When I argued that it could be folded and if not, its still 2 cms longer - they brought down more staff to pressure me into paying 8000 rupees for additional baggage fee, when the weight was under the allowance. They were very rude and did not listen to me. Never again. Worst experience ever.

### "luggage was never loaded onto the flight"
Flew KLM from Atlanta to Kuwait through Amsterdam. My luggage was booked all the way to Kuwait but it was never loaded onto the flight from Atlanta. Now I have been stuck for several days in Kuwait with only the clothes I wore while traveling. KLM has done nothing to ensure that my luggage is sent to me. I would think that an airline could read the final destination luggage tags to ensure that luggage gets to the traveler. However, in This case KLM has not helped in any way to get my luggage to me. They made the error and have not rectified the situation in any way, shape or form.

### "What happened with their customer service?"
Two times flew with KLM - and really never again. What happened with their customer service? It's worse than terrible - it's non-existent. One of my KLM flights was delayed and we had a very short connection. I was told by KLM crew when we were in air that I won't make it to the next plane (also with KLM) and to go and exchange my ticket. They didn't even let me disembark from the plane first so I could try to make it to the next leg. The service desk they directed me to was an automated kiosk that offered me a flight in 24 hours! I then had to find a service desk with people and wait for 45 min to be served. The customer service representative then told me that apparently I would have made it to the plane if I ran and questioned me about who told me that I was not going to make it to the plane. Lesson learned - do not trust what KLM flight crew tells you. My other flight that I booked on a different date (with a much longer connection) - the ticket says I can change the dates at any time. When you go to the app, it says "sorry, you cannot change online, please contact us". After 1.5h on the phone waiting for them to pick up - no response. Their so called "24/7" social media customer service is of course also non-responsive. It's an absolute joke. Another lesson learned - avoid flying with KLM if you value your time (and money).

### "staff at the airport were terrible"
Hugely disappointed with KLM at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. Flying with them was fine, but the staff at the airport were terrible. I arrived at the airport 2 hrs pre-departure, plenty of time considering I had checked in online and wasn't checking a bag. The queue to check-in/get my boarding pass was a disaster - not moving for 40 mins, and then at a snail's pace for another 45. Every passenger seemed to have a problem & huge delay, but more consequentially, the staff were just slow, and far, far too relaxed. There was no organisation of the queue or the time being taken. Eventually I went to the neighbouring line, supposed to be for another flight, where the staff I dealt with started to produce my boarding pass (all I needed! ), but got distracted and left me. Another one finally gave me the boarding pass, and at this time all my delay margin had been used up, and I had to run through control and to the security at the (distant) gate, sweating, breaking my carrier bag, creating the worst possible start to a long, multi-stop journey. Every individual staff member I dealt with at the check-in desk was: rude, unhelpful, completely apathetic whether I caught my flight or not, unprofessionally having relaxed conversations with colleagues while ignoring passengers - all who were anxious directly because of them. The system itself must also be questioned where slower, bag-dropping passengers are queuing with those already checked in and are not expecting such a slow line. A group of kids ahead of me in the queue - who caused much of the delay - were fast-tracked to the gate, I wasn't given that option despite being behind them, and barely told which direction to walk in (getting a scoff when I asked). Again - the staff on board - fine, efficient and friendly and the service is good, and the pilot's communication excellent. But Belgrade's check-in staff - with their incompetence, unprofessionalism and lack of regard, caused massive stress, and ruined my day.

### "Delightful experience!"
Not Verified |  Delightful experience! Great polite and very attentive flight Crew. Comfortable first class seats. Great variety and quality of meals and snacks. Interesting wine and spirits menu. If KLM can do this so well, why can't any American lines manage this level of commitment to customer service?

### "took my small Samsonite hand luggage from me"
Budapest - via Amsterdam - to Aberdeen. The departures and arrivals were punctual, the flights were smooth and pleasant -- would have been pleasant but there were stressful because of the other conditions. Already at the check-in desk in Budapest they took my small Samsonite hand luggage from me saying that the flight was fully booked and my boarding pass contained a label 'Hand baggage not guaranteed in cabin'. It is a small 2-wheeled suitcase, I have been using it for years, it has never been taken from me. That is, it was not prepared for this kind of transportation (it was not locked, for example). Of course, the flight was not fully booked at all, approx. 70-80% of the seats were occupied, and there's a lot of free luggage space in the cabin. Then the worst part ensued: it was an almost one-hour waiting in a aprrox. 150m-long queue at the gate D8 (the queue stared at D2) with the passengers of UK flights for checking our documents (covid tests, passenger locator forms, etc.). We were not informed at all about what would happen when the time of closing gate was coming. One of the few helpers from KLM told me that there's no any guarantee that I could reach my flight to Aberdeen. In the 45th mintue of my "sojourn" in this queue I got the first sms from KLM, that my flight's gate was closing... Finally, when I was already sure that I missed my connecting flight, another helper of KLM cried around for passengers to Aberdeen then we (approx. 15-20 of us) had to run after her to the gate. It was absurd. I arrived in Aberdeen exactly 24 hours ago, but my suitcase has not. Allegedly it arrived on the board of another KLM flight yesterday afternoon in Aberdeen, I haven't got it yet, I don't want to imagine its condition after this journey.

### "worst flight of our lives"
It was without a doubt the worst flight of our lives. Comfort is something you won’t find flying KLM. I had a back and neck pain after flying 8 hr in a seat and full airplane without much space to move around. We were literally seating shoulder to shoulder. We couldn’t even use the entertainment center to help because it never worked properly. Cabin crew was so rude I even avoided going to the bathroom unless extremely necessary. And they changed one of our flights without informing us. I just found out because I had to fill out our plf and had to check the information for the form. When we call it was a ping pong game trying to find out who could help us. A nightmare. A complete nightmare. Never again. I just prefer stay at home if I have to deal with them again.

### "experience was very positive"
Not Verified |  I was prepared to the worst, but my experience was very positive. The check in was very fast, the crew on the plane were very kind qnd professional. The interior of a plane was spacious and clean. They offered sandwiches and various beverages. My flight from Amsterdam to Bordeaux was delayed 10 minutes and I got a notification on my phone number and via email. I think that the price of the flights were far below the service we got. I feel confident about this company and I will surely be flying with them again.

### "seats were tiny"
Amsterdam to Kiev. KLM is terrible, avoid at all costs. You must pay a crazy price for checked luggage and the price associated is higher than what is listed in the fine print. The seats were tiny and uncomfortable and the food is garbage. I would gladly pay another airline more just to avoid.

### "lied to by a KLM representative who I put my trust in"
KLM put me through a real ordeal earlier this August. I had booked a flight to visit my family in Canada a month before my travel date of August 12th 2021. I started to prepare all the necessary documentation required for my entry to Calgary, Canada. Closer to the date of my departure, I had yet to receive my approval from the IRCC Canada to be able to enter the country. Wondering if I should postpone my flight dates, I called the KLM helpline, they were unable to give me any information and informed me that only the airport would be able to give me accurate information as to whether I could fly or not. After being told that I could get a full refund if they do not allow me to board the flight due to the COVID restrictions, I would be able to get a full refund on my full purchased ticket. With this information, I packed my bags and headed to the airport with plenty of time to spare, in case anything were to go wrong. Once at the KLM check-in desk, at the Dubai Airport, I handed all the documentation I had and the KLM representative started the process of printing the boarding passes. I interrupted him and mentioned that I did not have the approval from the IRCC which was stated as a requirement on their "travel doc" site. He assured me that I would not need it, I told him to please check for me to make sure, because I did not want to be stranded anywhere, he got up of his seat and proceeded to a team leader or a manager on duty and then assured me again that I would be able to fly and would not have any issues transiting through Amsterdam or entering Canada. With this information, I was very relieved and informed him that I was not prepared to fly today as I thought that that would be a requirement, but just for the sake of trying I decided to get the information first hand at the airport. He then mentioned to me that there was not a problem because I have all the other documentation which are important except for the approval which is fine. Long story short, once I arrived at my point of transit Amsterdam, they did not let me board the flight to Calgary, and informed me that I needed the IRCC approval to get on the plane. Completely distraught and disappointed, I took the next flight back to Dubai, leaving an hour later. That was how I spent my entire day, was lied to by a KLM representative who I put my trust in, and stuck on a plane for over 13 hours with over 5 hours of layover. When I decided to take up the matter with KLM customer care, they admitted to their mistake but still refused to give me a full refund for my full ticket flight that was completely wasted. I spent a total of AED 4,955 for the flight which was not returned. I then had to spend a lot more money trying to book a last minute flight to Calgary with another airline once the approval came out. I have never been more annoyed and insulted with KLM's deceitful actions. I definitely would not recommend KLM to anyone, solely because of their customer care.

### "it was a pleasant experience"
Positives: well-maintained planes, friendly and professional crew, very convenient transfer at Schiphol airport, extremely comfortable refurbished seats on Boeing 737-800, opportunity to order ‘Economy Plus’ seats for just €18 with lots of legroom. Drawbacks: abysmal online ticket booking system (card was processed yet booking confirmation and ticket were not generated because ‘payment was pending by bank’. Eventually had to hang on the customer service phone line for 20 mins until they had to charge my card again to confirm the booking), no hot food on a 3-hour flight (just a sad-looking cheese sandwich was provided), extremely expensive even for last minute booking (£600 one-way). Despite the drawbacks, overall, it was a pleasant experience and I would be happy to fly KLM again subject to attractive pricing and that their booking systems are fixed.

### "still trying to change a flight"
Not Verified |  I am still trying to change a flight on KLM which is to take place next week. Because of a previous cancellation of a flight by KLM, I cannot change the flight online and have to use the customer service. The KLM customer service is totally overwhelmed. I tried the UK service. They just hang up saying to many inquiries. The Swiss line does not replay. The Dutch line does not take calls in English language. Unbelievable, I have never had such a bad customer service experience ! ! I doubt that I will be able to change the flight before it actually takes place next week. In that case I may have to reclaim the lost fare.

### "check-in was extremely slow"
We were pleased to fly an airline that obviously tries to help its stressed customers, in COVID times. At all levels, we were helped. However check-in was extremely slow, because most of customers were connecting to USA in AMS, and their Covid documentation was complicated. KLM should have dedicated a counter to pax not going to USA, or not connecting. It took us exactly 70 min to drop off our luggages.

### "crew was professional and friendly"
Great experience as usual with KLM. Service on the ground was friendly and quick. Boarding was swift and comfortable with biometric gate scanners. The crew was professional and friendly. The seat was comfortable with generous recline and gold legroom. 2 meals were served. Pasta and a sandwich before landing which was great. Recommended!

### "the whole catastrophe"
Not Verified |  My 10 month old baby and I had to fly from Manchester to Toronto and we connected in Amsterdam. Before getting on the plane, we handed over my baby's stroller which was supposed to meet us at our connection in Amsterdam, however it never did. The flight attendants were amazing (the only good part of the experience) and tried to help us find it, even the pilot himself came to try and help, however he informed us that someone made a mistake and never put a tag on the stroller so it went straight through to Toronto. This was just the first bump in the whole catastrophe that was my experience with KLM. I then had to carry my 10 month old along with my bag throughout the airport and wait for our next flight. Anyone with a baby can respect that workout. I was a bit upset but understood that things happen. We finally got on our plane to Toronto and after a very long day we go to get our bags and as soon as I saw the stroller bag a KLM employee walked over to me because he could see that our stroller bag was ripped to shreds. As soon as I took the stroller out it appeared as though it was hit by a car. The wheels were barely holding on, the frame was bent and even her car seat and adaptors were broken and would no longer connect into the stroller or car seat base. This bag was clearly thrown around enough that even her blanket which was inside the car seat was ripped. This was my first time ever flying with my daughter. It was stressful enough without all of this happening but again I understand that these things can happen. The KLM employee had me fill out paperwork and explain what each product was and an estimate of how much they were. He provided me with a number which later on, proved to be useless. They said to call KLM when I got home to quarantine (Canada 2 week mandatory quarantine). I called KLM when I got home and explained everything. They told me I would be contacted in 2 days. 2 days passed and still nothing so I called again. I then got a manager named Rocky who told me I would be contacted in a week. Once again, I was never contacted. I then called again and pressed the prompt to see the status of the claim and I was put on the phone with a man. The only thing he was able to do was give me the claim number that I had already provided him with. He said that he was in sales (I don't know why that prompt brought me to sales) and told me that I needed to get in touch with customer service. I asked him if he could forward me to them and he said he was not able to. I then asked if I could speak to a manager and he said he did not know who his manager was. Keep in mind each time I called I was on hold for 2-3+ hours. And multiple times I was on hold for 3 hours or more and they would hang up. I could honestly go on forever about all of the specific things that this company did but to avoid writing a novel here ... long story short I did not hear back until more than a month later. And the only reason I did hear back was because I contacted KLM's media department who I was not supposed to contact about claims but I had no clue what to do anymore and wanted to try anything possible. Keep in mind I was told that I would know when I would either get a replacement or my money back within 2 days. When I did hear back it was through email and I had to provide a plethora of information and then she told me I would receive a full refund.

### "could not find any of our tickets"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight through KLM on Saturday 8/14/21 for Sunday 8/15:21 from Dubrovnik to Boston with a layover in Amsterdam after we missed a previous flights. After we bought the ticket from KLM. We got a reference #. We called several times to get the itineraries but no one answered. We arrived to the airport at 10:30 am waiting in line for 1 hour to check in. The ticket agent checked me in first. She had a trouble printing my ticket from Amsterdam to Boston. She checked my bag. Then she get to my daughter. She said she could not find any of our tickets after we got charged for both of our luggage’s and tickets. Not sure what happened here. When we called the customer service, we were told that was our fault as we didn’t called to get the itineraries. We had to book another to fly to Paris and to Boston the next day .

### "no way of getting in touch"
Not Verified |  Inexistent customer service! I haven't even made the trip yet and will probably not fly with these chaps again. And unfortunately this is probably the way out for national carriers when they try to imitate instead of compete with low price airlines. There is absolutely no way of getting in touch with a live human being at KLM except 1 global american phone number which of course always is over-jammed with calls. They go out of their way to not have to speak to their customers and redirect you to chat bots via whatsapp och facebook messenger. They even don't have any numbers for their local ticket offices (because of course those they still have?). My request is a little unusual with special baggage and can't be handled by a simple chat bot flow chart. They also imitate the low price carriers in their baggage policies and added fees for add-ons and leg room and insurances. I expect this kind of service from Ryanair and Wizz and their likes and frankly that's those companies USP. But when previously respected national carriers start behaving the same way, I frankly don't see the point in flying with these dinosaurs anymore.

### "fighting to receive my refund"
I purchased tickets for May 2020 with KLM - New Delhi - Amsterdam - Bucharest. I couldn't fly at this time because of the virus outbreak. I received a travel voucher. I decided to exchange my voucher into cash in May 2021 because I wasn't going to use it. I filled the form online in order to do so. In the field "Remarks" I wrote clearly that the bank account that I originally purchased the tickets with is now closed and I would like to be contacted via email before the money transfer so that I could provide the employees with details of my functioning bank account and receive the amount. Instead of being contacted, I received an email that the money was transferred to my old bank account. I contacted my old bank immediately and they explained to me that if an amount gets sent to a non-existing bank account, it automatically returns to the sender account within few days. I have been in contact with KLM service agents via chat and explained the situation, asking them to process another refund. They asked for a document certifying that my old bank account is closed and that my old credit card doesn't function. I provided them with this document, issued from my old bank. Afterwards, they didn't process a new refund as they said they will, instead they told me that sometimes it could take up to 2 months for the amount that was sent to my closed bank account to return to them and that I will receive the amount on my new bank account after 2 months. 2 months have passed on the 5/08 and I have received nothing from them, no refund, no email informing me about the refund being processed. I wrote a reclamation on their website 1 month ago explaining everything because the only time when I could actually reach their customer service via phone, the employee told me that writing a reclamation is the only way to process my demand and that he cannot help me on the phone. I have received no answer to my reclamation. Customer service is impossible to reach via phone, and in Messenger/Whatsapp they reply within a day. Then you have to wait for another day for them to reply to your next message. When they do so, they ask the same questions that were already answered by me one day ago, leaving me with the impression that they haven't red the previous text messages. This really slows down the refund process, creates confusion and a feeling of complete disorder. After 2 months of fighting to receive my refund and no results, I am outraged by the incompetency of the customer service and the disorganization within this company. I have seen nothing from my 200 euros ticket refund.

### "no business class style of seat"
This plane is old and there is no business class style of seat. Shocking when you pay business class prices and rewarded with an economy seat with same legroom. No pre take off drink offered. A breakfast box offered for this 50 minute flight. The chief flight attendant was fabulous cheerful and an asset to this airline which made the journey bearable. KLM obviously don’t spend money on planes & cabins. I wouldn't personally choose to fly with them based on this experience and my previous flight from Dammam. This airline is in need of a major overhaul if they want to compete with the Middle Eastern Airlines who have fabulous cabins and young planes.

### "A tired old plane"
A tired old plane that seems to been refitted with newer business class seats which are an outdated 2-2-2 configuration so dreadful for window passengers to climb over aisle seated passengers. This is outdated & should be changed for ease of movement & relaxation for passengers. In the days of Covid you get two choices for a hot meal but at least you get a hot meal so it’s a plus here. Staff pretty friendly but disappeared after lights out & never saw them again. Although seat is flat bed you can’t move once lying flat &, it’s very claustrophobic. KLM flying old planes that have not been refitted with the passenger in mind sadly when you compare the layout to the middle eastern airlines who have a far superior product in terms of cabin layouts. It’s an OK airline but not recommended for flights over 6hrs.

### "The worst flight experience"
The worst flight experience I ever had. I book a ticket in KLM from Mumbai to Amsterdam. The flight suppose to departure at 2:30 am. But they extended the time to 5:30 due to bad weather, then extended to 7:30am. Then by 8am they said the flight is canceled because the crews are tired. All other flights in the airport resumed their operation by 5am. KLM forced those tired passengers to find accommodation yourself even if it is a covid 19 pandemic everywhere. Everyone needs RT PCR certificates. Most of those certificates going to expire on next day. Most of the people came to Mumbai from different parts of India in domestic flights. After making a lots of issues in airport at-last KLM agreed to book hotel for everyone. And then, hotel transportation was very poor, by 12 pm they only managed to accommodate not even half of the passengers. Then the airline rebooked ticket for every passengers, and it includes travelling via different countries, and transit visa required for those countries. Those selfish crews in the flight made everyone’s journey very pathetic. Then nothing expected about their cabin services when i departure my flight, and i was right. Very poor cabin service. Never ever travel in this flight even-if they offer a free ticket for you.

### "I would not fly with KLM againv"
Poor experience. Food was below standard. No meat served on both flights. Sandwiches and vegetarian dishes only. I received one sachet of hand sanitiser for the whole 12 hour flight. My bag went missing in Amsterdam. I was not informed and had to find this out by waiting at the bag carousel until the last bag. Worst of all, they took over a day and a half to get my bag. No phone call or apology from any staff. An absolute nightmare to contact a poorly manned customer care portal. The staff were not interested in speaking with me and tried to fob me off with generic web links for me to follow. I would not fly with KLM again after such a poor experience.

### "KLM could not care less and offered nothing"
I changed my return date weeks before my trip. When I arrived at the airport to travel home, KLM informed me I wasn't ticketed (even though I had emails from KLM saying I had a ticket). I spent hours in the re-booking line only to be told they couldn't help me and to call a 1-800 number. I spent the rest of the evening/the next morning trying to rebook my flight since the automated system kept hanging up on me. I was finally re-booked and KLM admitted it was a ticketing issue on their end but I had to spend hundreds of extra dollars and miss work due to their error. To add insult to injury, my husband and I weren't seated next to each other in the half empty plane and I had to beg to get the seat upgrade we had originally paid for. KLM could not care less and offered nothing in the way of compensation except a shrug.

### "never going use this company again"
I am a Turkish Citizen living in Cape Town/South Africa. I have a United Kingdom visa and I booked a flight from Cape Town to Kyiv via KLM. I sent a message by WhatsApp to KLM to ask if I can fly to Kyiv with my UK visa. They sent me a link to check if I need any requirements. And uploaded my documents to the KLM system and the answer I got is "Visa is not required for transit through the Netherlands" (my final destination was London but the reason I was flying to Ukraine was to vacation in Kyiv instead of staying in UK quarantine hotels) So I have been to the airport on time and the KLM staff took my passport and told me to wait. I waited for 1.5 hours and they told me they can't reach head office to ask about my situation. And then they told me they talked to Netherlands consulate and they don't allow me to fly. Today (2 days later) I reached the Netherland consulate and asked about the situation. The answer is "no one called them. KLM staff lied to me and they didn't allow me to board. only told me if i want to fly to Turkey i can but to another country they can't allow. Turkey is also on Red list countries by UK. Why should i want to fly to Turkey. I couldn't fly. My hotel booking in Kyiv is gone. I booked another flight with double price with 2 stops. And I am trying to refund my money back but it is impossible to reach anyone on KLM. They give some answers on Whatsapp but only after 15 to 20 hours later for each messages. I am never going use this company again.

### "you show no respect to your most loyal customers"
Not the first time I complain about KLM. Beside their food being the poorest and their new lounge before Covid restrictions being extremely poor now it is even worse than before. The reason for this post is that KLM does not respect it's most faithful customers and makes any FQ status a farce. My status is plat for life. Check-in in Brussels was fine and fast but then when wanting to enter the diamond lounge I was not permitted to enter. Reason was that KLM has no contract with this lounge anymore. When calling the platinum service line I am told to go to pier b next to gate 1 and use the Brussels Airlines lounge. Firstly this lounge is closed, secondly this lounge is in the non-Schengen area of the airport and as I am flying within Schengen to Amsterdam I could not go through as I needed to go through passport control. This means that all business class, as all passengers entitled to lounge entrance have no lounge to go to when flying out of Brussels airport with KLM. Very poor service and you show no respect to your most loyal customers in my case ex customer.

### "Never flying this airline again"
Not Verified |  Never flying this airline again. I never write reviews but this experience was so terrible I had to do this so others avoid this terrible company. We were 3 hours from Amsterdam to Atlanta, then had to turn around due to an “error in a backup system”. Once we landed, we were told to go to a terminal where we waited an hour and a half to even talk to anyone, then another half hour talking to someone to get a new flight and a hotel. Once we finally arrived at the hotel, we were told that they would have to check with the hotel about our service dog. Mind you that the assistant at the desk called the hotel in advance about him. We were given ramen noodles, a small bottle of water, and a stale croissant as consolidation.

### " never ever fly with them again. "
A company with no responsibility, they cancelled my flight 24 hrs before the departure for COVID reasons (and this can happen in other companies too) but the unexpected part was that they didn't respond to my messages/calls in WhatsApp/local office/Facebook/Twitter. they didn't call me or offered me another flight with another company, they simply cancelled the flight and send me a mail. unexpected behaviour from a big company. I'll never ever fly with them again.

### "shocked at the unprofessionalism of the staff and airline"
Not Verified |  I will never fly this airline again, I was flying with my family to Canada with a layover in Amsterdam. I had a broken foot, which made travel slightly more complicated, I called the airline several times (was disconnected every time) to book special assistance for the airport. I eventually got through to KLM and the woman whom I spoke with was rude and condescending (saying things like "do you even need a wheelchair" and "you're wasting my time"). She albeit reluctantly booked special assistance for my ticket and I thought that was that until I got to the airport. The flight attendant working there kept denying me wheelchair access despite my ticket saying I needed it and my visible crutches and cast. I had to get a supervisor involved to get the wheelchair I needed (the airport was far too large to use my crutches the whole time). After I finally got the wheelchair and made it to my gate, they helped me onto the plane. I had to repeat a similar song and dance during the Amsterdam layover. I finally made it to Canada and the moment I got home I changed my return flight to another airline. I was shocked at the unprofessionalism of the staff and airline. Please steer clear.

### "Overall, it was ok, at best!"
Overall, it was ok, at best! At the first leg at Guarulhos Airport to Amsterdam, I flew in one of the most uncomfortable seats in my life (that's my wife's opinion as well), and I can say that I have some mileage regarding national and international travels. The food was good, and it was served three times. A small lunch when we departed, a dinner during the night, and a good coffee with some snacks before the arrival at Amsterdam. The airline mentioned that the flight were supposed to have onboard wifi, but that wasn't true. At least, the onboard entertainment catalog was ok. The second leg, from Amsterdam to Göteborg-Landvetter was extremely pleasant. The Embraer airplane was very comfortable and roomy. We booked a seat with extra leg space, but I felt that wouldn't be necessary for this flight. So my advice is: Get a extra room seat in the flight to Amsterdam, and the regional flights with Embraers are ok, if you don't want to spend that much. Arriving at Gothenburg, we found that my wife's luggage hadn't arrived. We asked for the attendant at the airport lounge, and he informed that for some reason, the luggage was in Amsterdam yet, and he requested a transport to bring her to Sweden. They delivered it in our hotel after 24 hours, as specified.

### "KLM has certainly been a mixed bag"
Flying with KLM has certainly been a mixed bag. I was initially due to fly on May 25th, but due to issues with my Covid-19 test, KLM rescheduled me onto the May 26th flight for free which was great! The check-in staff for KLM at Incheon airport were awful, however. Despite my final destination being Manchester, the check-in lady refused to send my bag there. I explained to her that I cannot leave airside in the Netherlands as I do not have a visa, therefore I need my bag to be sent to Manchester. She didn’t care and simply had it unloaded in Amsterdam. As a result, I ended up in Manchester without my bag and had to speak to a member of staff to organise delivery of my bag from Amsterdam to my home address in the U.K. Here’s hoping it will arrive tomorrow... The KLM staff in Amsterdam were a direct contrast of the staff at Incheon. They were so kind, considerate and very willing to help in any way they could which was wonderful to see, especially as travelling has now become so much more complex and daunting. The cabin crew onboard both KLM flights were also fantastic. Very warm, welcoming and accommodating. It was great to see social distancing being observed as much as possible on both flights and standards of cleanliness onboard seemed high. Food options on the initial ICN - Amsterdam leg were not great. Everyone received a pot of fruit, a yoghurt and a pastry towards the end of the flight with some juices, tea and coffee. This was the only food service available on the 11 hour flight which was disappointing. I found the choices on the inflight entertainment system to be very limited and decided against using it in the end.

### "I will never fly with KLM again"
I found out this morning KLM would not let my husband board the plane to come be with me in the USA as we visit my mom who has cancer. I am a US citizen and he is Swedish, but by US law our marriage is valid and recognized in the USA. President Biden has also made a presidential proclamation earlier this year that a spouse of a US citizen may enter the USA (even during Covid-19). Our marriage certificate, population register, plane tickets, passport copies, and my families address and information was all not proof enough for KLM. We called TSA and we called the American Embassy and they both said these legal documents would be enough to prove our marriage and that my husband would be able to enter the USA. Apparently KLM has higher standards than the TSA, American Embassy, and American government combined. The refusal of letting my husband come is a violation to our rights and is breaking federal law. It is really sad my husband can't be here with me and my family right now. He is a part of our family, even if he is not a US citizen and he should be allowed to visit with family. I will never fly with KLM again, I will never recommend this airline, and I am not okay with this.

### "every time I was getting disconnected"
Not Verified |  I purchased a refundable ticket through my phone in the US. Later because of current covid regulations we could not travel and had to cancel. When I called the customer service line I was told that upon booking the system redirected me to the Bulgarian KLM site and that I had to cancel the tickets through them. They went ahead and transferred me, then I had to stay on a 20 min hold only to get disconnected with no answer. When I called back I was told the Bulgarian center had just closed. Called the following day, bright and early, after trying to transfer me 3 times for 10-20 min hold each and every time I was getting disconnected. When I asked to speak with a manager I was told that instead they could give me the Bulgarian # so I can try on my own and pay international phone fees. About 30 min later, still on the line trying to speak with a manager. Next I will just call my cc company and cancel.

### "Poor communication, poor customer service, lack of information"
I had other choices, but because of past pleasant experiences and the good reputation of KLM, I chose this. I realize that travel during COVID is complicated, and KLM surely made it even more so. Please let me outline my major issues: 1) First, I had trouble in the weeks leading up to my travel finding out what tests I needed to transit through Amsterdam and how I could get a PCR test that was given on 72 hours before landing in Amsterdam, yet be sure that I would receive the results on time. I realize that this is not KLM’s rule, but the people at KLM were not very helpful in guiding me on how to do this. I was told, “Other people do it, so you figure it out.” I was able to get more information from Delta. 2) The day before I left, I got an email that my flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain had been cancelled and I was rerouted through London. That was also what was shown on the KLM website, however, the Delta website had the original itinerary on it. When I got to the airport to check in, I was assured that my flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain had not been cancelled. To be sure, I asked the gate agent when I got to the gate. I was again told that I was on the originally booked flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain. However, when I arrived in Amsterdam, I found that was not the case. 3) There was no one to greet those of us on the canceled flight and tell us what to do - no signs, no guidance at all. 4) Being unable to check in at the automated site, after several attempts, I found that I had to go to the KLM transit office. The KLM person there asked for my COVID test results, and I showed her the printout of the result I had received. She said it was unacceptable! It was the official result that had been downloaded from the website, but she kept telling me it was unacceptable.Then, she told me I needed a copy of the visa to get into Bahrain, I always get the visa when I get there. She then told me that I did not have the correct paperwork to go through England. I was tired and frustrated. KLM sent me through London, then tells me I don’t have the correct paperwork to go through London! I had a copy of the quick COVID test that I had done Monday morning with my doctor’s signature, and she finally accepted that. I got my colleague at Arabian Gulf University to send me an electronic copy of the visa, and she accepted that. Then, before boarding, KLM agents wanted to see my COVID test results again. Fearing the same response, I also showed them my vaccination card that showed I had gotten two doses of Moderna in February. I was finally allowed to board the plane. Poor communication, poor customer service, lack of information. 5) When I got to London, I had no problems with my Corona Test Result report downloaded from the internet, and they did not ask for the visa. Poor communication. 6) When I arrived in Bahrain the day after I was supposed to arrive, my luggage was not there. Several passengers, those of us who were rerouted through London, did not have our luggage. I filed a missing luggage report. 7) I didn't get my luggage for two days, and I had to go pick it up from the airport. It was not delivered, and I was given no compensation.

### "I begged for an answer once, twice, thrice"
This was, hands down, the most out-of-this-world idiotic experience I’ve had in quite some time. I have contacted CS because KLM has allowed me to book and pay for a flight they then showed canceled in the confirmation page. Was this designed to trick me into paying for something that isn’t available to then rebook me on an option nobody wants, perhaps. Or perhaps it was an issue of the internal system not correctly showing customers real-time information. In either case, it’s their fault and it felt irritating. The agent offered me a second option which I confirmed I wanted, proceeded to book me, and then two seconds later informed me that that flight too was canceled. Either a sick joke, I thought to myself, or complete incompetence. However, the agent then came up with a list of other options, all that were not ok for me because were arriving either too late in the night or they had me sitting 7+ hours in layover. At one point, however, they came up with an option that was more than impossible and then simply proceeded to book me and send me a confirmation without waiting for me to even reply. Why I say this option was impossible is because the connection flight was leaving at 10.40 while the first flight there leaving after that, at 14.40. You then understand how it’s impossible for me to bend physics and time and space continuum, to catch a flight that leaves hours after I’m supposed to catch my second. Total insanity. Upon insistent questioning I didn’t get even one apology, but a passive-aggressive message informing me to make up my mind quickly because all the available flights get booked quickly. The option the agent had next for me was a flight that seemed familiar, until I realized it was the exact flight they offered the second time - the flight that they booked and then informed me it was already canceled. So this person was offering to book me on a canceled flight, once more. This, my dear reader, is when I lost the will to live in this nightmare. I asked them if they were simply mocking me at this point. I begged for an answer once, twice, thrice, as they weren’t answering my messages at this point. After about 45 min the agent comes back, untroubled and provides me with another 2 options - one of which was again not possible due to limitations in the fabric of space and time. I gave up and agreed to one of the options that required me to spend 5 hours in layover, thinking it’s better than the rest of eternity in this purgatory. Now, you judge my experience and how many stars it deserves, but I for one cannot comprehend the level of absurdity I was forced to endure for about 7 hours while on your Customer Service messenger line.

### "our booking had not been paid for"
We booked two business class seats for travel on January 7th from DPS to SIN and return SIN to DPS on the 9th of January. Payment was by bank transfer and received 2 immediate confirmations; an email from Permata Bank confirming that the money was transferred successfully to KLM's bank account; the 2nd email was from KLM with booking confirmation (UKLFCP) complete with seat numbers (1A and 1C). We got to the airport (DPS) at 7pm for a 9.30pm departure, only to be told on check-in that our booking had 'not been paid for'. We showed the check-in staff our booking confirmation and the email + text from our bank confirming that the payment had been received by KLM. After being refused travel, we called the duty manager at DPS , who appeared to take great delight as he told us we 'didn't have a ticket'. We showed him our payment confirmation and booking confirmation, which mentions ticket conditions, etc. Yet he refused to allow us to check-in. We asked him to call KLM in Holland but instead he called Air France who could not help. By this point, we had been at the customer service desk for more than an hour and a half and were unable to reach a single KLM staff member other than the passive-aggressive station manager who told us that the only way we could travel on the flight was to buy two more economy tickets (business class was full). He told us to try and book the flight online on our phones which we tried to do, having absolutely no choice to not travel (my husband's Indonesian visa meant that he had to leave Bali on the 7th, or face a hefty fine. We also had an appointment at the Indonesian embassy to get our permanent residency for Indonesia). At the same time, our phone showed that KLM was still advertising business class seats on the same flight! We tried to book those but KLM's online payment facility failed. We asked the station manager if he would let us pay for those business class seats which were still being advertised online through the customer service desk (remember we had already paid for two business class return tickets). The station manager refused to let us do that and forced us to buy two economy return tickets, for 13,501,200 RP. Our original payment for the two return business class tickets on Dec 21st was 14,340,800 Rupiah (over $1000 USD). To add insult to injury, as we were leaving the desk, we asked for a pass to the lounge to grab a quick drink and perhaps a sandwich (we'd been at the desk now for almost 2 hours). The staff said, 'you are traveling in economy'. During this process, we sent several requests for help via the KLM WhatsApp number; sending them copies of our proof of payment and booking confirmation. They did not respond for almost 2 hours and when they did, they told us that the case had been 'resolved' at the check-in desk, which of course it had not. We purchased business class tickets on Garuda to travel back from SIN. We launched a complaint to KLM. On February 18th, KLM offered us €600 euros compensation each, but on February 19th, we received the following email from KLM customer services agent  'Regarding the Denied Boarding Compensation, the legislation does not apply for trips out of Europe (DPS-SIN). Hence, I must revise what I have previously stated, and I do apologize for that. For those above reasons, this situation does not entitle you to compensation.

### "wasn't at all what we had booked"
Not Verified |  On January 24 we booked a trip on KLM from Bergen, Norway to Barcelona, Spain, for travel on September 2. We booked long ahead of our travel dates to get a good schedule at a good price. Our trip was KLM 1188, departing Bergen at 2:10pm and arriving in Amsterdam at 3:55pm, and KLM 1675, leaving at 4:45pm, and arriving in Barcelona at 6:50pm. We expected to have a nice, leisurely morning before heading to the airport. However, on March 30, we received two emails indicating that our flights had been changed. The first email stated that we were being changed from KLM 1675 to KLM 1681, leaving Amsterdam at 8:35pm and arriving in Barcelona at 10:45pm, making it impossible to make any connection to our final destination. Our layover in Amsterdam was changed from 50 minutes (a little short, but it's what we chose) to 4 hours and 40 minutes. Then, 90 minutes later, the second email stated that we had been changed from KLM 1188 to KLM 1186, leaving Bergen at 11:35am and arriving in Amsterdam at 1:20pm. Now we were not only arriving in Barcelona quite late, but our layover was changed to 7 hours and 15 minutes. This wasn't at all what we had booked, and was the first instance of poor customer support -- and we only chose KLM on Travelocity because it met our needs, not because of a specific desire to fly that airline. Unfortunately, due to other obligations, I studied KLM's flight choices on April 2, three days later, and tried to change my flights at that time. Travelocity assisted at this point, for quite a long time, but ran into problems with KLM. I stated that the first flight was acceptable, but that we'd prefer the second flight be changed to KLM 1673, departing Amsterdam at 2:15pm. This would change our layover in Amsterdam to 55 minutes, and restore the trip duration to something very similar to our original trip. Instead, KLM decided that our original flight was most comparable (in price or class) to a flight leaving at 6:05am! They would only change our tickets to KLM 1184 leaving Bergen at 6:05, and KLM 1669 leaving Amsterdam after a 2 1/2 hour layover. (And, they charged a few dollars per ticket, extra, for the privilege of this horrible start time, and longer trip.) I was informed after the fact, by Travelocity, that I should have contacted an airline within a day of being notified of unacceptable flight changes (and I'll do so in the future! ), but this wasn't my highest priority in those few days. What's most irritating, however, is that not only did KLM somehow think that changing a trip duration from less than 5 hours to more than 11 hours was "reasonable", but that the final resolution of moving a flight from 2pm to 6am was all that was offered. I'd heard that KLM was a decent airline, and we'll find out for ourselves in September, but this customer experience makes it very unlikely that they'll get our business for any of our future travels.

### "I had very pleasant and smooth flights"
By now I board KLM flights with high expectations and, once again, I had very pleasant and smooth flights. As the customer you feel in very goods hands, brand-new spotless aircrafts on both segments, thoughtful hygiene measures, decent food and drinks. Yes, it used to better in the past, and the entertainment is limited, but with all the logistics and extra-costs these days I am just super thankful that KLM goes out of its way to make short and long distance travel possible again. With many airlines still mostly grounded and in coma, the world oldest running airline is, once more, an air pioneer, at least for us in Europe.

### "Somehow I did not expect much"
3rd time on KLM flight, 2 times flew on City Hopper with unpleasant experience and this time on World Business. Decided to try their long-haul flight and it turned out different from my last experience, although on this flight there was 1 person out of many who's still have that attitude. It make me wonder if there is difference between city hopper and world business cabin crew's quality or is it just service inconsistency? Somehow I did not expect much based on previous flight experience with them. One item on the menu was not enough to cater its business class passengers, therefore I had to choose another option. Perhaps because of the ticket booked on the same day of departure. Unlike any other airlines I have flown on, the food on this flight were served in little tiny portion but tasty. Should there be any chance to fly them in near future, would give it another try to experience other crew and service to another destinations.

### "The flight attendants did not seem happy about doing their job"
I flew with KLM from Mexico City to Zurich via Amsterdam. I will go over my thoughts about the experience point by point: (1) Both the Mexico City and KLM have a mask requirement, so obviously I was wearing one, and also I had additional masks in my hand luggage. However, KLM's ground staff in Mexico City asked me if I had a mask (ignoring that I was very obviously wearing one), and when I asked to clarify, they incorrectly claimed that KLM requires FFP2 medical masks to be worn. While I did have such a mask with me, KLM does not actually have such a requirement (see https://www.klm.nl/en/information/faq/airport-on-board). In challenging times such as the COVID pandemic, it is more important than ever to know the rules and to be respectful to customers, which KLM didn't do. (2) The aircraft interior on both flight legs (Mexico City to Amsterdam and Amsterdam to Zurich) looked tired and old. The flight attendants did not seem happy about doing their job. (3) KLM Crown Lounge 25 in the Amsterdam airport had a sign that it was closed at 2 pm. My flight arrived at 3 pm and I had a connection time of almost 6 hours. (By the way, the airside hotel YOTELAIR did not have any short term stays available, and Aspire Lounge 26 only allows access three hours before a flight.) As a result, I had to walk around the airport and sit in crowded areas, which is not good in terms of social distancing. (4) On the flight leg from Amsterdam to Zurich, I was given a hand sanitizing gel only quite a while after the meal and the drink, making it useless. Overall, considering Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is also not as attractive as it used to be, I will avoid flying with KLM in the future.

### "supervisor and staff were so rude and arrogant"
I wanted to check in for a flight from Johannesburg to Amsterdam. Telephonically KLM had confirmed that a study visa will be sufficient to enter the Netherlands under Covid restrictions. At the check in counter, to my genuine surprise, they rudely and arrogantly tell me that I am not entitled to check in because a study visa is not sufficient. The supervisor and staff were so rude and arrogant, I will never fly with this airline again!

### "I have never seen less"
Not Verified |  There are so many things to day about KLM, the oldest passenger airline in the world. It has kept the same quality for many years, and it is a great representation of Dutch efficiency and thrift. So many reasons to fly them, so many reasons not to as well! But today, I want to rant about one thing: the KLM “entertainment” system. It is indeed entertaining to see a major airline with this ridiculous selection of TV and film choices. Imagine you have flown any airline at all (ok, not Ryanair, but you know what I am talking about! ): you probably get a system with at least 5-10 comedy, and as much Drama and Lifestyle and Docu options, usually a full season. Then you get at least 5-7 full “box sets” (entire TV shows). I have never seen less. For films, by my count the average is 50-70 films, with about 5-10 new films, and staples like Harry Potter or ET and things of the sort. Now, we have KLM’s entertaining system: Two episodes of of TV comedies. I kid you not. Two single episodes! Three episodes of Drama shows. Three full seasons (season 2 of the Handmaid’s Tale!). Four episodes of “lifestyle” Five episodes of “docu” (incl two KLM promotionals!) Films: 30 films total, including “children’s programme” featuring a ridiculous KLM aircraft, Docus, promotionals, etc, the highlight of which is Benjamin Button! There is not a single film that a blind man doing sentence in a dark cell in Burkina Faso had not seen. I mean, how many people want to see Yogi Bear? I am glad I have an ipad.

### "Loyalty doesn't always pay off"
Das mag tausend gute Erfahrungen geben, aber wenn man selbst betroffen ist, und das nun schon mehrmals, und das kann eben sowieso jedem jederzeit passieren, ist man verloren. Keine Hilfe, hirnlose Verweise auf Ihre Internetseite, keinerlei persönliche Hilfestellung, das alles im Ausland, bei dem nicht immer stabile Wifi Verbindungen vorhanden sind. Schade, jahrelang gerne KLM geflogen, demnächst werden wohl andere mein Geld kriegen um ihre Gesellschaft und ihre Arbeitsplätze am Leben zu erhalten. Auch PanAm war mal toll, wie so viele andere. Warum man daraus nicht lernt, wird sich mir nie erschliessen. Aber nicht meine Gesellschaft, nicht mein Arbeitsplatz. Treue zahlt sich eben nicht immer aus. Demnächst dann statt Service und einstiger guter Erfahrung nur noch Ticketkauf beim billigsten Anbieter. Beschissener kann auch dort der Service nicht sein und vielleicht gehöre ich dann da zu den tausenden, die auch mal gute Erfahrungen machen. - That may be a thousand good experiences, but if you are affected yourself, and have done so several times, and that can happen to anyone at any time, you are lost. No help, mindless references to your website, no personal help, all of that abroad, where stable WiFi connections are not always available. It's a shame, I enjoyed flying KLM for years, soon others will probably get my money to keep their company and their jobs alive. PanAm was great too, like so many others. Why you don't learn from it will never become clear to me. But not my society, not my workplace. Loyalty doesn't always pay off. Soon, instead of service and what was once a good experience, only buy tickets from the cheapest provider. The service couldn't be poorer and maybe I'll be one of the thousands who have good experiences.

### "I would not fly with KLM in the future"
I booked a flight through Delta in October 2020 to travel to Amsterdam, Netherlands. When I booked the flight I was told to contact KLM to request a bassinet seat since I was traveling with my infant and I would be flying with KLM. I contacted KLM and was assigned economy seats for the flight to Amsterdam. I was also provided with the seat assignments in economy comfort for the return flight to New York. In October KLM informed me that I would need to pay for my husband's seat on the return flight as it was economy comfort and I made that payment. I was not informed at that time that I also needed to pay for my seat assignment. When I arrived at the airport in January for the return flight to New York and checked my bags I was told that I needed to pay 100 euros for my seat, at that time I had no opportunity to then change my seat assignment because that was the only bassinet seat available so I paid the 100 euros. KLM did not inform me about payment for a seat that I was assigned to and then I had no choice but to pay for the seat assignment because I was already at the airport checking in for my flight. I should have been informed in October when I was told that I needed to pay for my husband's seat assignment. I contacted KLM when I returned to NY and they responded weeks later stated that I could not be reimbursed because I wanted to sit next to my husband? My complaint was never understood and they only apologized for taking two weeks to respond to me. They also stated that "Fares are dynamic in nature and not guaranteed. They may change quickly depending on various factors like the period of travel, seats availability, the destination, as well as the number of passengers trying to book that particular fare at the same time. The fares may increase or decrease as per the availability. Fares increase and decrease before purchasing a flight and if there was a change in the cost of my flight I would have been notified. This experience is very disappointing since the KLM staff at the airport and on the airline were great but the customer service before and after have guaranteed that I would not fly with KLM in the future.

### "Crew very friendly and helpful"
This is a very difficult time for airlines where everything has been cut back. Fortunately the customer service remains of a very high standard and both flights with this airline were extremely pleasant. Crew very friendly and helpful. Aircraft clean. Food service on short haul was good considering this was a short flight. On the longer flight the cut backs are evident but you get a dinner snack pack and a tasty breakfast when you arrive. The dinner appetizer was a hot very tasty pizza slice. A great idea. So thanks to those making the best of a tough period and for keeping your customers happy. I understand it is not easy.

### "Both legs of my flight were pleasant"
Communication with KLM help center is painful (be prepared!) mostly due to enormously long lags in their answers, but eventually I managed to arrange my flight with a pet. The check-in was extremely thorough and took an hour while all the docs were shown, filled, signed and doublechecked. The staff in Manila is very helpful and attentive, as well as flight attendants along the way. They checked my cat (once even on their own initiative, heartfelt thanks to the flight attendant with a Russian blue cat). Both legs of my flight were pleasant, non-turbulent, with soft landings. Special appreciation to that delicious spinach pies. They did my long flights a lot easier. The set of multimedia was not that bad, too. But getting earphones upon an explicit request is a somewhat strange experience. Drawbacks: economy is quite costly, well over market.

### "their service and hospitality was truly amazing"
For my initial flight, I flew one of the COVID-19 pilot test flights with three different stages of testing. I was glad to hear KLM and their SkyTeam Alliance was offering something like this to make travel safer and to lessen the quarantine time once you arrive in the Netherlands. The cabin cleanliness and quality was excellent but it was their service and hospitality that was truly amazing. It was my first international flight and I was flying alone. I unfortunately discovered I get severely motion sick. All the other flight attendants were especially attentive and kind. The entire flight they made sure I had every possible comfort down to an extra pillow or another blanket, soothing tea and ginger sodas, crackers, and were even kind enough to provide me with a motion sickness medicine. I’ve never seen such genuine care and wonderful hospitality on both my outbound and return flights. My return flight was much busier but the crew was still just as kind and attentive, if busier.

### "This airline was like flying with a pauper"
After a immaculate service and presentation by a certain airline from Qatar to Brazil. This airline was like flying with a pauper. The 777 inside looked tired. The seat pitch was poor and when the person in-front reclines then it becomes uncomfortable. Yes I flew economy. But many airlines provide gracious service in economy. This airline offered none. The tray area was greasy & sticky, old tissues from other passengers inside the magazine holder. A measly small pasta with tiny salad & flavorless dessert. AVOD with no music just pre-recorded podcasts. Cost cutting has been taken too far and service is non-existent. Never again.

### "Worst experience with an airline"
Ground staff in Amsterdam tried to offload me. They kept telling me that I won’t be on board of this aircraft. Just got on board after 30 min. intervention, discussion and nightmare waiting time as they eventually found out that my luggage was booked straight through to Sydney (with Cathay). Seriously? My customer complaint with their Customer Satisfaction department got rejected if not totally ignored: Original reply, translated: According to our records, there is no irregularity or other occurrence in relation to your booking. It seems likely that KLM had to check that you could travel. This can sometimes take some time. Due to the current situation in particular, additional audit measures are unfortunately necessary. This is not satisfying as the airline called me 2 days prior to the flight to make sure that I hold all necessary documents to avoid any issues during my travel. Also, these documents were checked even on the first leg, from Stuttgart to Amsterdam. The actions of their ground staff were highly unprofessional, just as their customer service desk. Never again with this Airline. Worst experience with an airline ever.

### "Arrogant and noisy staff"
Arrogant and noisy staff. Extremely old and dirty plane. It was a 6am flight and staff were  super noisy chatting loudly at the back of the plane for the whole trip. Staff are also very arrogant and rude when you approach them to ask something. A Finnish women not speaking good English was treated badly and then ignored because of that fact. The plane is extremely old, it must have more than 15 years old and inside it looks horrible because it was also dirty. For a 6am flight that should have been disinfected and during Covid times this is unbearable.

### "Service was courteous throughout"
This is the first flight I took after the whole world locked down. I was slightly anxious due to risks of flight cancellations, covid infection, immigration issues thru transit, etc. When I boarded the plane, I was greeted by an energetic and friendly crew. I would have excused them if they were not in their best mood due to job stress their industry has been going thru. But I appreciated they made us feel welcomed. We flew with the Boeing 787 , so it was a nice and new plane. Service was courteous throughout, so kudos to the team. I also noticed their site has changed and became more appealing and modern looking.

### "KLM only refunded me 22.00 dollar"
I bought my daughter tickets to come see me here in Germany which I haven't seen her in 7yrs. She is six months pregnant. The German government changed their laws not allowing America's in do to the pandemic plus the airline already changed their flight once. So I asked for a refund so I can buy them a ticket later. These tickets cost over 2000.00 dollar and KLM only refunded me 22.00 dollar.

### "I had an excellent experience with KLM"
I had an excellent experience with KLM, the crew were just incredible from check in, lounge and on board! Considering how much service is being reduced on other airlines during this COVID time, I was pleasantly surprised to receive my welcome drink and full meal and drinks service. Staff wore masks and gloves for the entire journey, even when resting in galley. I am looking forward to my return leg. Thanks KLM!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Not Verified |  This was the worst experience of my life. My wife and son who are Hungarian were denied tickets I paid for. It took a month before my wife was finally able to join me, my son stayed in Hungary because of the treatment he received by this airline. My bag was lost by the airline and they refuse to pay my claim, I am also out money they refuse to reimburse for my son's ticket. I have spent over 35 hours on the phone with this airline.

### "blame COVID-19 for everything!"
Due to a change in schedule in my MIA-ATL-AMS flights last June, I was informed by Delta that I would have a long layover in Atlanta if I went on my original booking, leaving me in Atlanta for over 8 hours while waiting on the interconnecting flight to Amsterdam. As i knew the lounges were probably closed and I didn't want to subject myself to a COVID-19 potential in a large airport for an entire day, I was obviously not at all pleased with this change. As I had bought the ticket from Air France, I called them directly and after explaining my distinct unhappiness with this change, which was a fault of the scheduling change, and not from my side, was offered another option of going with KLM instead of Delta and this would reduce my layover in Atlanta to 4 hours, so I decided to change to this option, especially since the business class flight being offered ha the same seating configuration as my original booking, which was in a configuration of 1x2x1. I specifically asked for confirmation of this and it was confirmed by the AF agent and they put me in the same seat number of 4A and I had double checked again when checking in was still accurate. When I boarded the plane in Atlanta, I was shocked and dismayed to see that the configuration of the plane was 2 - 3 - 2 instead and there was never any notification about this. They had still kept my boarding card at 4A but now there was a 4B next to me and what's worse, the entire business class section was packed with passengers, offering no social distancing whatsoever, and the person next to me had brought in a greasy back of food from one of the fast food restaurants and I had that smell with me the entire journey from Atlanta to Amsterdam, and in my clothes the remainder of the following day. Also there was no real food service, only a terrible pasta dish (economy fare) and soggy sandwich dropped on my seat later on, only served water and flight attendants literally disappeared. Upon returning home, as a Platinum member of Flying Blue, I complained a number of occasions to KLM and, each time they finally decided to respond after weeks of waiting, they persisted to blame COVID-19 for everything! They gave no excuse why COVID-19 caused an aircraft change and them not dutifully informing me, why it was so full with no social distancing possible, why no drink service apart from water was offered, and why flight attendants disappeared. I got nowhere with them and gave up finally vowing never to darken the door again with them. I had traveled to the US with Delta Airlines from Amsterdam, and they were 100X better, and they have implemented a block middle seat policy in all classes of travel to assure social distancing. No such thing in KLM it seems even though they blame the COVID-19 situation on all their faults. I told them categorically that I will always go with Delta from now on and they couldn't care less in all my correspondences!

### "Very poor customer service"
The flight itself was fine. However, if the check in desk staff had had her way, I might never have got on the flight. I realize that during this current climate of additional rules and regulations, staff may not be able to keep up with all the constant changes and will need to verify whether or not they do actually have a good understanding of Covid protocols and procedures for different countries but this needs to happen before inflicting their incorrect knowledge on the customer. I arrived to check in my bags for a long 2 stop trip to Colombia and the staff member promptly informed me that tourists weren’t being allowed in and that I would not be able to travel. Having not had any sleep and checking in at 4 in the morning, I was not quite ready for this and was wondering how I had got my information so wrong. I queried it and she called someone who evidently told her she was right. I told her that this was not true and that tourist flights had begun at the beginning of October. She said I was wrong and showed me an ambiguous statement on the KLM site and then said she didn’t have time to deal with disagreements and had other people to check in. I asked for a number so that I could call KLM about it so she gave me an emergency number and shooed me away. I then realized the emergency call number only took calls after 8am. My flight was at 6am. I decided to look up government websites to show her that tourists were being admitted. I found the proof and went back to the desk. After some more telephone calls she then came off the phone to tell me that in actual fact I was right and that I could fly. I was just shocked at how easily she could say no and then say yes without even a lame apology. Very poor customer service. I did not speak to her as I did not want to hold up the queue or stress out even more about it but staff should be trained well enough to not treat customers in such an off hand manner, especially when I could have lost my flight over it.

### "Very pleasant flight with KLM"
Very pleasant flight with KLM. Efficient boarding procedure and aircraft clean and well maintained. Cabin crew very friendly and chatty and obviously enjoying their job. A small snack box containing a sandwich, cookie and water were served along with a muffin and a choice of hot and cold drinks. Flight arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule.

### "do not recommend this airline"
My flight was canceled the day after buying the ticket and I was never informed about this, I had to notice it myself on the app. After seeing the cancelation I requested a refund and bought a ticket with a different airline to reach my destination. A few weeks later I received an email updating me about "my flight" which had a changed time and a stopover which I was not informed about and which I have not agreed to. At this point, I reached out to your support and asked if my refund will be processed anyway in addition to how this is even possible without my agreement. I was assured multiple times that there's nothing to worry about. After more than 10 weeks of waiting, I received an email saying "We are sorry to inform you that we are unable to handle your refund request mentioned in the subject, as the ticket submitted for refund has been exchanged in the meantime into a new document". What does that even mean!? At the end of this, I am left with no flight, no money (160 EU is big money for a student going to visit family), lost 3 hours filling in forms you keep on directing me to, 20 mins + the phone bill for calling your customer service with no result, and the Facebook support is still not taking me seriously and asking to wait for something more. Horrible experience, do not recommend this airline. Even Ryanair and Wizzair are more transparent about their flight changes.

### "cash refund request was sent and declined"
It has been 182 days since KLM cancelled my flight. It has been 155 days since my first cash refund request was sent and declined. It has been 65 days since my second cash refund was requested. They’re in breach of EU Regulations. Never book with this airline.

### "the usual professional and friendly KLM service"
Flying from an almost deserted Amsterdam Schiphol Airport on an E175. Apart from the personnel no one at the security check. Nice, but unreal for a major airport. Other than that the airport has sectioned off parts of the airport. Services and shops seemed to operate as normal. A very light load for this flight, no more than half full. Aircraft clean and well maintained. The crew friendly and professional. The usual uneventful flight with all passengers wearing the mandatory facemasks. A complimentary small sandwich and a beverage was served. Landed on time in Copenhagen where the arrival procedure was changed with a route via passport control, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The return flight was equally uneventful, with the remark that Copenhagen airport has closed a great number of shops and food outlets. Service is good, but it feels like a shopping mall on a Sunday morning. This flight on a B737-700 was about a third full. With the usual professional and friendly KLM service.

### "the cabin crew were not nice at all"
The pandemic has influenced the services provided a lot, which is understandable. However, I don't enjoy the way the flight attendants treated customers on that flight. I brought the ticket with Delta, and I wasn't informed that no meals will be provided. But the cabin crew were not nice at all. They told me that they can't talk to me or provide any services, due to the pandemic. But I saw them coming out with a tray to provide services to some other customer. In fact, all I wanted to do is asking them to file this situation that customers who brought tickets with Delta was not informed. But they deny to do so. I think they should treat everybody equally and be more pleasant with their way of communication.

### "staff were really nice"
Amsterdam to Zagreb. The staff were really nice, the plane clean despite being a bit outdated. A snack was served. The boarding area in Amsterdam is a bit confusing. On a very personal note, I want to say KLM has the best uniforms ever!

### "the last choice to fly with"
I was going back from my 2 weeks stay in Mexico with the connection (Mexico) SLP-MEX-AMS-KRK (Poland) A day before the trip (10/09/2020) I received information from KLM confirming that I will travel next day and can check in - so just confirming that everything is fine. At SLP airport I received a ticket to MEX and was told that for next part of my trip I should go to the KLM Check-In Desk to collect remaining tickets. My baggage at SLP was sent directly to KRK. At MEX airport I went to the KLM check-in desk. During check-in it appeared that there is some problems with my tickets - I was waiting about 1 hour to get some explanation and the person was contacting with many other people next to him and calling by phone many others. After that I received information that my reservation is OK but my tickets are not OK due to some mistakes in the system done by my travel agent who was selling ticket to me - I could not understand such explanation - how can happen that reservation is OK but tickets are NOK. And was told that if I want to travel I need to contact my travel agency to clarify or buy new tickets. It was during the night and I was during my trip with total duration about 24h. Finally I manage to contact my travel agency and to due to emergency situation the new ticket was issued - but the whole process took probably more than 2 hours. I received some explanation from KLM with the screen shot of their system - and they were telling me that in one column there is a letter "E" in their system but it should be something else. But the same letter "E" was with the flight I had just before from SLP-MEX done by Aeromexico operator. I asked why it was possible to fly with Aeromexico with identical status and it's not possible with KLM - they told me - yes because it was domestic carrier but with KLM you can not. I do not know who created the problem: KLM or my travel agency - but from my point of view full responsibility is on KLM side. Why did they confirm a day before that everything is fine - do they know what they have in their electronic systems ? - looks like that they do not know. Why the same ticket status was OK for Aeromexico and NOK for KLM. Why in the middle of the night they told me - you can not fly - it's your problem - in our KLM system there is status with letter "E" but should be something else. KLM from now on is the last choice to fly with.

### "safety measures concerning COVID-19 was good"
The information shared before departures were comprehensive. Check-in in Amsterdam was fast and safety measures concerning COVID-19 was good. They checked the documentation necessary to enter Japan as a foreign resident. There were 60 passengers, which meant that everyone had an individual seat row to themselves. There were no passengers in the rows surrounding me. The crew were very welcoming and smiling. Food was limited, there was no choice in menu, but they handed out an additional bag full of snacks a few hours into the flight. Departure and arrival on time. A smooth ride once more.

### "nobody social distanced whilst queuing"
Even though the airport is not too busy, the ground staff were not very friendly. They were just stern when checking your boarding pass and passport. We also needed to check in our suitcases ourselves, which seems to be a feature at the CDG airport. Everyone is required to wear a face mask in order to board the plane, and nobody social distanced whilst queuing to board. On board, we had a lemon cake and water. The main things that changed following the pandemic is that KLM now requires face masks, whilst the selection of food and drinks on board have shrunk. For example, this flight no longer serves alcoholic drinks but only soft drinks, water and coffee/tea. Upon arrival, passengers were encouraged to wait for the person in front to leave first prior to leaving the airplane. However, none of the passengers did that. There was virtually no social distancing when disembarking as well. No space was left between passenger groups either. It does not appear that this airline takes safety very seriously, as the only thing required is a face mask. On board, when passengers were not wearing face masks properly, they were not asked to put them on well either.

### "very similar to pre-pandemic times"
This flight is in July 2020, in the middle of the COVID19 pandemic. At check-in, the ground staff was meticulous and helpful. He helped us to check if we needed any special rules whilst going to Paris. KLM requires face masks to be worn throughout the flight, except during meal times. When boarding, the announcement encouraged social distancing although this is not generally maintained by most passengers. KLM also does not maintain separate seats between passenger groups. In economy class, the flight was full just like before the pandemic. For the flight, only a lemon cake with water was provided in a box. This is not too dissimilar from before the pandemic, except the sandwich has been replaced with a slice of cake. Overall, the entire flight on KLM is very similar to pre-pandemic times, with the exception of face masks required throughout the flight.

### "Very poor seat, no service"
Very poor seat, no service. As shown on my boarding pass we were registered in business but the seats were given to crew passengers. A company to avoid. When they have a difficulty (and clearly the situation is difficult) it not their problem, it’s yours, without any adapted service or help provided on board or at the airports. I had may flights to change and even cancel during the last months, and the only company unable to provide any help is KLM.

### "had to pay 70 euros for my trolley"
I travelled from Amsterdam to Milan, and I had to pay 70 euros for my trolley to be put in the back of plane only because I knew the regulations of the italian government for covid-19. Knowing that I went to the check-in desk to ask if I had to hand in my trolley there (as I knew that the check in of the hand-luggage was free of charge), and they checked the weight of it, and as it was exceeding of 0.6 kilo, I had to pay 70 euors. The real problem is that more than half of the passengers of my flight as they didn't know about the new covid-19 regulations for flying to italy, took their trolleys and hand-baggage at the gate and they were not checked for the weight. This means that doing like this I didn't have to pay. I think this is not fair.

### "never want to travel with KLM again"
Came to Helsinki from Amsterdam on June 22 with KLM. I paid an extra € 45 for my luggage and in the end my luggage did not arrive in Helsinki. Calling for 5 days in a row and very difficult to reach and very unclear via website. My luggage is still not back and has to wait for KLM to answer online only. I get all of my insurance back in full as long as they provide confirmation that it is lost, but even that is difficult and is sent from chop to branch every time. I have chosen KLM for years and now that a problem has arisen from KLM itself, they cannot even offer a service or help properly. I now have a very bad experience and never want to travel with KLM again. Op 22 juni vanuit Amsterdam naar Helsinki gekomen met KLM. Ik heb €45 extra betaald voor mijn bagage en uiteindelijk was mijn bagage niet aangekomen in Helsinki. 5 dagen achter elkaar aan het bellen en zeer slecht bereikbaar en via website zeer onoverzichtelijk. Mijn bagage is nog steeds niet terug en moet maar afwachten op KLM die alleen online antwoordt. Ik krijg alles van mijn verzekering volledig terug als ze maar een bevestiging geven dat het verloren is, maar zelfs dat is moeilijk en word elke keer van de hak naar de tak gestuurd. Ik heb al jaren voor KLM gekozen en nu dat er een probleem is ontstaan door KLM zelf kunnen ze niet eens een service aanbieden of fatsoenlijk helpen. Ik heb nu zeer slechte ervaring en wil nooit meer met KLM reizen.

### "driven to support customers"
Not Verified |  The customer service and care I have experienced from KLM has been beyond anything I've experienced from any other airline. During the Coronavirus epidemic, I left London to isolate with my family in Sweden, just as London went into a full lockdown. I didn't know when I would get back, what was happening with my work. KLM were phenomenal. Getting through to speak to someone was surprisingly quick every time. I had a pet in cabin as a special request on my booking, so had to call each time I needed to make changes. This could have been super frustrating, but it wasn't at all. Their reps were always super kind and friendly, very helpful - every time just went out of their way to help me. I had to change my ticket 5 different times. Each was quick and easy to do. My dad also had a booking with them that did not fall under the cancellation / rescheduling rules linked with COVID, but they still went above and beyond to offer him a travel voucher, which he wasn't really entitled to. Using their app is easy. Their prices are good. Service on the plane was good too. I have just been so super impressed with their company - they genuinely seem driven to support customers, rather than just to make capital.

### "parents were denied boarding"
Toronto to Amsterdam. My parents were denied boarding after KLM rescheduled their flight. They speak no english and they refused to talk to us over phone. They provided no help whatsoever just left them there overnight without any help. The next day we make a complaint and we get an email saying that their records show they landed in Denmark. Is this a joke to you KLM? With everything that is happening we trusted KLM to rebook the tickets. Staff super rude and unprofessional. No one has called us back to this day.

### "especially rude in her attitude"
The flight from Quito to Amsterdam stopped at Guayaquil, and although I was aware of this, I had not anticipated having to get off the plane with all our hand baggage for the plane to be fully serviced and refuelled. We also had to go through check in and security again, which was also irritating having already done this at Quito after arriving there for check in the required 3 hours before boarding. During the flight, I found one of the stewardesses to be especially rude in her attitude to passengers. I had a seat with extra legroom, and I and adjacent passengers had placed our empty food trays on the floor in front of us, and the stewardess demanded that I pick them up saying that she hadn’t got time to do this. I complied with my own tray but declined to do the same for the other passengers who meanwhile had gone back to sleep. We had also paid extra for comfort seats, which offered additional recline, but these were very little different from the standard seats on the outward flight

### "never fly with this airline again"
Not Verified |  I am deeply disappointed with this airline. I was suppose to fly from Sofia (in Bulgaria) to New York with a 6h transit in Amsterdam. I waited 6h and when we were suppose to board the airline staff did not let me board due to the current travel restrictions. However, according to the US you are allowed to enter the country if you come from a non-Schengen country like Bulgaria. Yet, they refused to board me (I'm a student with an F1 visa and work authorization in the US). Two days later I call customer support for a refund. The woman I talked to refused to give me a refund. I asked her why she wouldn't let me and she said that the decision was made (she wouldn't give me a valid reason) and I couldn't argue against her. To me, this is unacceptable. I paid over 700 euros for a service they did not provide. Why would they let me buy the ticket in the first place if they would refuse me to board the plane? Based on these two extremely bad experiences, I am certain I will never fly with this airline again.

### "told they had run out of food"
London to San Jose via Amsterdam in January 20209. The short hop from Heathrow to Amsterdam was fine and we were surprised to be offered refreshments on such a short flight, including wine and beer which I declined as it was only 9:00am. However for the long haul flight from Amsterdam to San Jose, we waited almost two hours after take off for drinks to be offered, and when the food service eventually arrived, we were the last two passengers to be served in that section and were told they had run out of food. The staff were very apologetic but seemed to suggest that we could simply miss the meal. I suggested that they provide something from the Business or First Class menu but this was declined. They did eventually put something together, I suspect from leftovers, but it was very unsatisfactory. The flight was booked through an agent as part of a holiday package, but we reserved seats directly with KLM. This was problematic, because even though we paid for the seat allocation, they wouldn't guarantee them until the tickets had been issued, and meanwhile we could have lost them.

### "very disappointed with KLM"
Not Verified |  I am very disappointed with KLM, I feel they have no respect for customers and are not interested in nurturing a reputation with customers. We were due to fly out in March, but because of the current situation the flight was cancelled and also Abu Dhabi had closed borders and still do at the time of writing this. I am fed up with being ignored and getting a generic answer of we are busy! I am sure they are but they have not helped themselves, they refunded my ticket, yet I am still trying to get a refund for my husband’s ticket. I don’t want a voucher I have no interest in travelling in the foreseeable future and I am entitled to a full refund of my hard worked for money.

### "I have been ignored, lied to"
Ho Chi Minh City to Birmingham via Paris / Amsterdam with Air France and KLM. Ripped off like many. I like many others had my Flights cancelled and have since spent many weeks of email correspondence trying to get a Refund. I have been ignored, lied to, mislead and led down the garden path by a Company which is defying International Regulations.

### "staff were friendly and efficient"
London to Amsterdam in October 2019. The check-in was efficient and it was my first time in ages flying from Heathrow T4. The boarding was also on time and staff were friendly and efficient. Unfortunately, after boarding we were held on the tarmac for half an hour but this was due to fog in Holland so was not the fault of the airline. The plane was comfortable and new and very clean.

### "The service was abhorrent"
Not Verified |  The service was abhorrent. They did not provide any choice of food, they never once even asked if anyone wanted anything to drink and when I had to ask for something the only thing that was offered was water. While the crew was making coffee behind the curtain, I was in the first seat in business class, when another passenger asked if he could get a cuppa coffee he was told no there wasn’t any. The crew was completely in attentive, I don’t even know why they were on board. The plane was an hour and a half late because the gate agents never told passengers before boarding that there was an additional security check and there was a line of at least 40 people. Have they been organized they could have told everyone and people would have been at the game earlier and not had a 1 1/2+ hour delay! This is the absolute worst flight I have ever had.

### "They send you a voucher"
Milan to Recife via Amsterdam. They cancel flights but are unable to refund them. They send you a voucher that you must use within a year.

### "just issued the voucher"
My flight never actually happened. It was cancelled by KLM and KLM refused to pay me a refund. They never even offered a choice refund or voucher but instead just issued the voucher. Since I have been trying to receive my money back but as thousands others I am unsuccessful. Horrible customer service. Avoid at all cost as you won't fly and won't see your money back.

### "not get a refund but a voucher"
Birmingham to St Martin via Amsterdam. After KLM cancelled our flights, due to COVID-19, we filled in the refund form online, expecting, as it said on the form, to get reimbursed. When this did not happen I called / e mailed & contacted everybody I could connected to KLM only to be told that the form was a Robot error & we would not get a refund but a voucher. I am still chasing my refund of £2,900 and will never fly or recommend KLM to anyone in the future.

### "never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Worse than budget airline service but without the budget airline prices. As a family we took over 20 flights last year and all but 3 were delayed (by over 3 hours) or cancelled. Trying to claim compensation for one of the delays (over 3 hours) has been impossible, and this was before corona crisis. The customer service is non existent and what little response I have had has made absolutely no sense and has just sent me back to the beginning of the complaint process. I will never use this airline again.

### "denying any compensation"
On my way back from Indonesia to Europe in June 2019, our main flight to Amsterdam was slightly delayed. If I was on time for checking in (Amsterdam-Cork), my checked luggages were not. Rather than letting me onboard to then deliver my luggags the next day by delivery, KLM found more appropriate and cheaper for the airline to make me wait another 12 hours in the airport (after an already strenuous travel from SE Asia.) When attempting to board the final plane as I was queuing with other passengers, I was denied boarding by KLM agents at the Gate while other passengers were allowed boarding (Flight operated by Air Lingus). I was told to go to another gate (T for transfer). Once at the T gate, I was told to wait 12 hours in the airport for the next flight. I was fuming and asked for compensation as I could have boarded this damn plane! KLM staff in the airport told me to contact customer service online to ask for compensation. According Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, I should have been informed by KLM about my rights regarding this flight delay, my meal and drink should have been covered, and I was entitled to get compensation. They claimed that I was late for my flight and missed it thus denying any compensation request.

### "horrible customer service"
KLM cancelled our flight three times. It was rescheduled in order to find a solution because of the current crisis. Absolutely horrible customer service that makes you feel like absolute garbage. This company doesn't respect EU laws as they refuse to refund cancelled flights. Customers must hold this company accountable and never fly with them again in the future.

### "refused to refund me"
I have been appalled by the treatment from KLM. They cancelled my biz class flight from Manchester to Bangkok and refused to refund me, giving me a voucher for £130 less than what I paid . I don’t want a voucher which I might never use but the fact that they refuse to honour the full amount I paid is deplorable.

### "I really enjoyed my flight"
Nairobi to Amsterdam. I flew with KLM on from the 20th to the 21st of April during the pandamic through a charter flight. As a teenager travelling alone for the first time, half way across the globe, it was important for me to feel safe which the KLM succeeded in. The food was definitely one of the best airplane foods I've had. In addition to this the entertainment available on each flight; they have music of all genres available, featured movies from all over the world, video games, and podcasts! I really enjoyed my flight everything surpassed my expectation, which is why I felt the need to take some time write this review.

### "won't recommend flying with them"
Rome to Stockholm via Amsterdam. I experienced the worst customer service ever. I received multiple emails every day either changing flights or cancelling the trip. It was so confusing that I had to call the customer support for confirmation. After my flights were confirmed to be cancelled, KLM kept urging me to opt for a voucher. They kept repeating that a voucher (1 year, non-refundable) was a fair option for customers and the companies. Even though I had a pleasant experience with KLM-AirFrance during my previous business trip, I won't recommend flying with them.

### "one big thank you to KLM!"
Cancun to Sofia via Mexico City / Amsterdam. I want to say one big thank you to KLM! I was trying to go back from Mexico to Europe for about two weeks, after my initial flight with another airline got canceled without even been told. KLM were extremely helpful, my flights were keep getting canceled due to the situation at the moment. But they were very nice and doing their best to put me on a flight back home as soon as possible. Yes, it was very difficult to reach them atm, but at the end I succeed. The journey itself was long and exhausting, but they took measures on their flights and cabin crew was very attentive and nice. They were also keeping me Uup to date with emails of whats going on with my flights, which at the moment was so so important. Aircraft were nice, clean and comfortable. I will definitely fly with you guys, again!

### "lucky to have very friendly crews"
Rio de Janeiro to Berlin via Amsterdam. Thanks to KLM our daughter could come back home safe from the other end of the world, although it took several days and rebooking. KLM was the first airline to offer rebooking as good as it was possible with the many customers around the world. Our family has been flying KLM quite often and has always been lucky to have very friendly crews!

### "voucher would take multiple weeks"
Los Angeles to Frankfurt via Amsterdam for 8th April. My flight from LA to Amsterdam was announced to be delayed for 2 hours due to the coronavirus, so I would not have reached my connecting flight to Frankfurt (the only one during the day). So I canceled my flight online and was told I would get a voucher. Finally, I got a message that issuing the voucher would take multiple weeks! I want to get out of here in about 2 weeks, not after "multiple" weeks. After complaining, I was told to be patient and report back if I haven't heard from them within 4 weeks! Now I'm stuck in LA.

### "the worst customer service I have ever received"
The airline canceled the flight, and it was nearly impossible to speak with a customer service agent capable of switching me to a different flight. I was not able to switch my flight on the website because of the type of luggage I was bringing, so I was forced to deal with their extremely rude and unknowledgeable customer service agents. I ended up being on the phone with them for hours. I was transfered around and spoke with several different agents, all of which gave me different answers about flight availabilty and refunds available. When one of their very unintelligent agents finally switched my flight to a new date, he also changed the baggage policy and wouldn't tell me why. When I asked if I could add another piece of luggage, he said "Thanks for calling", then just hung up. I am a very active flyer and have flown with many different airlines, but this was the worst customer service I have ever received, and will avoid flying with KLM in the future. I will happily spend double the money to fly with a half-decent airline.

### "cabin crew was very friendly"
Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. The cabin crew was very friendly, which is a good thing for me who is a nervous flyer. The seat is comfortable for a tall person, and spacious. The food was okay for me.

### "couldn't reach customer service"
Not Verified | Lusaka to Zurich via Amsterdam. Disastrous. Got a notice that my return flight from Zambia to Zurich was cancelled two days before flying without any alternatives. They have no office in Zambia. I couldn't reach customer service via Whatsapp, Email or phone service, I tried to call them for 4 days countless hours. The online rebooking tool didn't work, just told me to call customer service. That was even before Zambia had reported cases of Corona so all other airlines were still flying. I ended up waiting until the very last minute and as I couldn't reach them and the German embassy issued a statement that travellers should leave the country immediately I purchased a list minute one-way flight with another airline back to Zürich over Nairobi, London, Paris and Geneva for a very very high price. If anyone has an idea how to get this money back, please let me know. Still haven't heard from KLM despite writing to them. Of course, this is an exceptional situation for all airlines but just dumping people somewhere. I mean. Never imagines such a big airline could behave like this.

### "disappointed in KLM"
Booked to return from Malaysia to Amsterdam on 31/03/2020. Flight cancelled by KLM one week prior to departure, the reason being Coronavirus. No options given except refund voucher to the value of the flight. I appreciate the problem the airlines are currently having, however: 1. KLM had a daily service to Malaysia. However, they reduced this by half in the two weeks before my flight was due to depart. Last KLM flight from Malaysia was on 28/03/2020 although both Kuala Lumpur and Amsterdam airport remained open thereafter. 2. I repeatedly tried to reschedule (bring forward) on the KLM website, but it would not allow. I did have a very basic economy ticket, but the website advised that all change costs were being waived by KLM in the current circumstances. But still not allowed to change. 3. If KLM had allowed me to reschedule and if they had kept their daily service up to 28/03/2020, I and numerous other KLM customers could have safely travelled with KLM. 4. I am of the opinion that the reasons behind the cancellation were purely financial; KLM calculated it was cheaper to cancel the tickets outstanding rather than send aircraft to Malaysia to pick up the passengers (many of whom would have very cheap tickets). A very cynical attitude from a major aviation operator when people are understandably anxious in the circumstances. I was able to buy a ticket on Malaysia Airlines (who were truly excellent in the circumstances) however I know there were many other people who were having great difficulty in getting/affording an alternative flight. Very disappointed in KLM, an airline that I have used for over 25 years both for business and pleasure and where once I had a platinum flyer card.

### "they even didn't say sorry"
Not Verified |  They lost my and my wifes baggage. The worst thing is not that they lost it, but how they treated after. Nobody cares, not answering emails or Facebook support by messenger. We received our baggage by own expenses from destination airport after almost one week and they even didn't say sorry. I only got email with 'case closed' and etc. They are not as royal as they pretend.

### "no charge for the phone"
Bergen to Moscow in economy class on a very old plane, the seats are bad and not comfortable. There is no charge for the phone. There is almost no food, there are drinks, but the choice is not large. We were treated to a cake in honor of the 100th anniversary

### "There is almost no food"
Moscow to Amsterdam on a very old plane, the seats are bad, sitting is not comfortable. There is no charge for the phone. There is almost no food, there are drinks, but the choice is not large.

### "Thin seats, not soft enough"
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. This is an intermediate flight from Europe. Big new plane. Thin seats, not soft enough. Offered a warm appetizer and drinks to choose from. There were not many passengers.

### "they couldn't rebook this flight"
Bergen to Denpasar via Amsterdam. I was meant to get a flight after this one on Thursday. Without notifying us. Luckily we saw it in the app. No information in the app. We also went to talk to KLM at the airport two hours before since they've cancelled part of our flight before. Amsterdam to Bergen. They said they couldn't rebook this flight cause the next flight was full. However you could still book this flight in KLM's app to a nice 800 euro. I showed the women this and she still said no. I've had minor problems with airlines before but the way handled this is just to absolutely disgraceful. We tried to contact them by calling them in Sweden, Australia, Indonesia and Norway. Always the same. 10 minutes then they said sorry all our operators are busy. Also tried contacting them through messenger, whatsapp and fc. I know these are tough times but dont cut your staff til 20 percent and cancel flights and dont respond anywhere.

### "cancelled without decent reason"
Not Verified |  Lima to Zürich via Amsterdam. My access to a flight I paid (transatlantic flight for 1100€) was cancelled without decent reason or informing me. The day before the flight KLM even accepted an additional piece of luggage for 85€ for the flight they knew I wasn't allowed to take.

### "I won't fly with them again"
Budapest to Rio de Janeiro via Amsterdam. Seems I won't fly with them again. I usually book this flight from Budapest to Sao Paulo with them and this time they charged me my only 23kg luggage. It is an intercontinental flight. I got to know that when I was dropping off my luggage at the airport. I was lucky I had a working credit card with me so then I purchase it online for USD 61.42. It was about 5am and there was nobody in the customer service of KLM to help me. It means they are careless with their clients who are travelling out of their working hours. The woman on the check-in at the airport was also helpless. When I asked her where I can go or which number I can contact to discuss this case she told me to look it up on the internet.

### "my first choice for now"
Manchester to Entebbe via Amsterdam. I find KLM a useful airline for my needs. They fly from AMS to most places I travel to and using their MAN service I can connect without the hassle of London. I fly in from home to MAN with another airline to connect. Fares are reasonable and their booking system works well. I have few complaints. I want a seat to my destination at a decent price and that is what I get. It irks to have to pay to reserve a specific seat, which could be inclusive in the ticket to remove the irritation. They generally are very good at keeping to time and seem able to catch up late departures on longer legs. We were delayed by weather in KGL by an hour but still made the connection in AMS comfortably by making up some time in flight. Flight crew are up to the job and seem friendly and pleasant when not under pressure. I will keep using them as my first choice for now.

### "charged $60 for baggage"
My experience with KLM is horrible. They charged $60 for baggage on the international flight and blamed Cheap O Air for not explaning that. An Economy Light ticket was purchased for a family friend coming from Riga to Los Angeles for one month. When she came from Riga to LAX she was not charged but coming back they charged. My suggestion pay few dollars more and stay away as far as you can from KLM. Also not only they charged for baggage it did not come both times when she came to LAX it took few days to deliver.

### "two great flights with KLM"
Again two great flights with KLM. Cheerfull crew who gladly serves a second round on request (or a sandwich). Seat pitch okay, crew allowed us to relocate so we could have a free middle seat. Good information from the cockpit and a punctual flight. Though it's a Dutch airline the safety information is in English only and I think that's good. One can always ask. Will definitely book again.

### "a very bad experience"
Billund to Amsterdam. I had a very bad experience flying with KLM this time. I had to book a short trip of three days to Amsterdam , because of a funeral. I booked online and booked for the 26 February from Billund to Amsterdam and the 28th back again. By a small mistake, the return ticket was booked on the 28th march. The receipt of the flight was written in very small letters, almost unreadable. Without internet and busy times in Amsterdam I did not check in for the return flight on time and wanted to check in on the airport. There the mistake was discovered and I had to buy a new ticket! The lady in the desk said there was no other way , and I had to buy a very expensive (almost twice the price of my previously bought ticket) return ticket. She said there were no other seats available, but once in the airplane, I saw there were a lot of seats empty. So no stars for this experience.

### "seat pitch is very limited"
This trip was - for the good and for the bad - what I expected from KLM and the same held for the return flight. The cabin has nice colours but a 2-2-2 configuration in C is clearly below standard, even of most 4 star airlines. In addition, seat pitch is very limited, no chance to get out of a window seat without your neighbour having to get up. Best of KLM continues to be their very hospitable and warm crews but this is about the ony thing which could be ranked 5 stars. KLM's problem is that they are a stingy airline and always have been. Food is among the poorest you can find in a renowned international business class, on this flight I could not eat it, first time this has ever happened to me. Same applies to their wine cellar. Great cellar master, but they don't give her money. Investing around 7-8 € into their C class wines is what QR and EK do in their eco cabins. The same stingyness I found on a previous flight in the food offerings of their AMS lounge, really poor. So limited seat comfort, poor food and beverages, but nice crews. But: they often make up for their deficiencies by attractive prices. Like in real life: you get what you pay for.

### "inadvertently cancelled the tickets"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Amsterdam. We booked tickets in January for a March 20 trip. Our cruise was cancelled due to the corona virus and we tried to change our tickets. Due to KLM's clumsy online forms, we inadvertently cancelled the tickets. When we spoke to KLM customer service, they refused to reinstate or change the ticket.

### "the most uncomfortable flight"
Birmingham to Las Vegas via Amsterdam. Not my first time flying a Boeing 787 (previous was an Aeromexico Boeing 787-8 which was relatively comfy) but my first time on a Boeing 787-9. By far the most uncomfortable flight I’ve ever taken! I’d paid a very modest fee to sit in economy comfort which is KLM’s equivalent of premium economy although it’s literally economy with an enhanced seat pitch! Aside from the leg room the seat was shocking. No support, very little cushioning or padding and for 10 hours. Not sure how people do it in economy. I flew JetBlue a few days later and that was so much more comfortable, even on a 5 hour flight. KLM have a good soft product, crews are usually nice, food and drink good, as is the entertainment but I’d avoid them in future and the Boeing 787 in general.

### "customer support is the worst"
Gdansk to Rio de Janeiro via Amsterdam. The company is not that bad, but the customer support is the worst thing I have ever seen in my life. Conflicting (or simply wrong) information is given all the time. Nobody assumes the responsibility for anything. I tried to complain but the response was "if you don't like our services you should fly by some other company". Between me and my family there were 5 trips already by KLM and not in a single one I did not have any problem. The issue is that they have the shortest path from where I live and the place I have to travel to.

### "not recommend this flight"
Was meant to fly KJLM from Amsterdam to Munich before connecting on Oman Air to Bangalore. When I arrived at the airport they told me the flight was overbooked and I had to go wait at the gates until it was boarding time to wait and see if there will be any no shows, although I had arrived at the airport 2 hours early. Initially the staff were incredibly rude. The staff did not want to help except for one exceptional women who I wish I got her name, went the extra effort after realizing how distressed I was. After a long time discussing things with her and her calling her senior staff I finally managed to get a seat. I would not recommend this flight to anyone. You must be able to check in online and have no other flights to catch.

### "a big kudos to KLM"
I want to give a big kudos to KLM. My husband who is in Johanesburg was supposed to come back to USA tomorrow but because of work that needs to be completed, he is not able to catch his flight tomorrow. He called KLM, and with no effort at all, the customer service agent on the phone was able to give him an extension for the trip. I will definitely recommend this company.

### "friendly and accommodating"
Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. The crew on KLM are so friendly and accommodating. Amenity kit handed out with menus and hot towels. Welcome drink served champagne. For dinner I had beef lasagne, also served with chicken satay entree and mango cake for dessert. Seat was comfortable and entertainment had lots of content. Thank you to the KLM crew for being awesome.

### "Worst customer service"
Amsterdam to Berlin. Worst customer service experience I’ve  had. Had to wait in the airport line for more than an 90 minutes, there was no delay whatsoever to my flight, no one could properly assist me, they told me I would get a free ticket for the next flight to the city that I was going to and when I went to claim that ticket they denied the service. Staff lack of empathy and understanding. I spent more than three hours in the Schiphol airport not being able to get any help. I’ve never felt so irrelevant and mistreated. Great way for KLM to make money!

### "most horrible seating"
Cape Town to Atlanta via Amsterdam. We had the most horrible seating experience I have ever had on a flight. We spent over 11.5 hours (from Cape Town to Amsterdam) either on top of the passengers next to me or visa-versa. The plane was configured 3x4x3 with the narrowest isles I have seen. Only 3 of the 4 seats had a designated place for your legs. I had no place for my legs. I will never fly KLM again. Clearly making their passengers comfortable is NOT their priority. I booked Delta and ended up in KLM... In addition, the flights to Amsterdam and Atlanta were completely Full!! Never, never, never again!!! What a horrible travel experience! !

### "Fare was pretty affordable"
Copenhagen to Amsterdam. Good flight. Good food. On time departure. On board staff were friendly. Comfortable trip and reached before scheduled time. Fare was pretty affordable. Food was good.

### "staff were friendly"
Amsterdam to Helsinki in June 2019. Good flight. Good food. On time departure. On board staff were friendly. The flight was delayed due to rain in the Netherlands.

### "Such a disappointment"
Barcelona to Amsterdam. Nonexistent Customer Service in KLM. My flight was cancelled while we were on the runway, causing major problems. I submitted a claim on the same day, February 3rd. Today is February 12th and I have not received any answer from them. Absolutely unacceptable. Way worse than low-cost airlines. Such a disappointment.

### "KLM is my preferred airline"
Torp Sandefjord to Singapore via Amsterdam. KLM is my preferred airline, mainly due to a good connection from my local airport. Reliable and helpful in case of any problems. In general a good impression of them!

### "treating customers with such indifference"
Me and my husband went Bristol to Sao Paulo via Amsterdam and arrived there without our luggage. In Sao Paulo, KLM staff told us that we could buy some things that we needed until we got our luggage back and when we come back from our trip we could claim the money back. Then after 3 days of a very difficult time without our luggage, they sent it to another city about 1 hour away from where we were. So we had to spend more money + time to go there to pick it up. Them when I came back to England I've tried to claim the money that we spent daily back and they have told me then that I had only 21 days to claim it back. But the staff in the airport did not told us about this, they gave us only some paper works about lost luggage but even on the paper works does not say anything about we having only 21 days to claim it back. So I don't know how we would have to know it. I think that this is very wrong as there was no way for us to know about the time limit to claim it back. I have sent all the paperwork to then and they can see that we haven't been told about it and still they do not care about us. Very bad company treating customers like this with such indifference. It looks like they don't give you enough information so they don't have to pay you back.

### "total waste of money"
Dublin to Amsterdam business class. had bought a semi flex ticket and upgraded at check in to business class. Huge queues for check in at Dublin so would guess many were running for their flights . Did not use the lounge - boarding on time - no air bridge - Seats old and in need of replacing - Aircraft + 16 years old and needs a refurb badly/ The seat had little padding. and standard Y class seats with middle free . Crew ok, went about the job no smiles. catering awful - was totally inedible and was a salad. Couple of drinks served with no problem. Landed on time - bags out first I would not pay for this service for 90 minutes - total waste of money.

### "good flight and service"
Flew on the KL 0947 City Hopper from Amsterdam to Belfast. As I had already checked my baggage through from another flight I was able to relax in the KLM lounge. The lounge is quite large and has a very good selection of food, snacks and drinks. The plane was located in a remote area, therefore we had to board via a bus, however the boarding process was quick and orderly. The flight itself was good and the cabin served a small lunch with drinks. We arrived in Belfast 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Overall good flight and service and will certainly try it again.

### "betrayed as a passenger"
Rio de Janeiro to Helsinki via Amsterdam. I have flown to Argentina with KLM before, and I have never had to pay extra for checked luggage before. Especially considering KLM is not a low-cost carrier, I would have never expected to pay extra for checked luggage on an international flight with KLM (or with any other carrier for that matter). When I performed the reservation process, at no time did I see a clear and visible placard stating that baggage was not included in the fare. This should have, in the first place, been clearly stated when I was searching for the price of tickets through KLM. I found out that my luggage had to be paid for at Helsinki airport when I went to drop it off. Furthermore, the fact that checked luggage was not included was also not clear during the on-line check-in process (because I could have corrected it there and paid for it). This is misleading and shows poor business practices on the part of KLM, tricking their customers into viewing low fares that so not include something as basic as checked luggage. Furthermore, they charge so much for the checked luggage at the airport (€60 at Helsinki, and €76 at Cordoba), that the fare ends up being more expensive than competitors. This is quite simply a scam. Also, when I tried to check-in online, I was unable to, because neither KLM, nor the other carrier GOL would allow online check-in. This meant that I was forced to pay even more for the checked luggage at Cordoba airport because I was unable to pay for it on-line (which would have costed less). I am very angry, and disappointed, and feel betrayed as a passenger, by my until-now favorite airline.

### "On board staff were friendly"
Amsterdam to Helsinki in June 2019. Good flight. Good food. On time departure. On board staff were friendly. The flight was delayed due to rain in the Netherland

### "service was excellent"
I travelled from Buenos Aires to Mumbai via Amsterdam on KLM. The service was excellent and appreciable. But on the leg from Amsterdam to Mumbai the cuisine on board was only vegetarian in spite of having passengers from many nations. Just because a certain percentage of passengers were vegetarians, this should not be forced on to other passengers.

### "Would highly recommend"
Amsterdam to Inverness. I have been flying with KLM for a while now and have not had any bad experiences. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Since I have been flying only within the Europe, there is always a choice of a snack and a drink. Even though the tickets are a little bit expensive but I do not regret paying more, as it pays off. Would highly recommend this airline.

### "a wonderful trip"
Not Verified | Amsterdam to Vancouver. Had a wonderful trip from Amsterdam to Vancouver on flight 681 on January 9th. I would like to thank purser and his whole team for an amazing and memorable flight! Thank you for everything

### "something goes wrong"
Amsterdam to Munich. Every 2nd time something goes wrong. Customer service is clueless and not at all customer oriented. It feels like talking to a wall, totally helpless and the customer is not valued. From now on when I have a choice I will book with someone else instead of KLM.

### "Was not happy at all!"
Seoul ICN to Amsterdam. Extremely old aircraft. My seat pocket was partially torn. Seat pitch was really narrow even for a small-framed female like myself. I can’t imagine how a tall Dutch man can manage to sit there for 11 painful hours. The IDF screen resolution was really low, I couldn’t read the English subtitle when I tried to watch “Pavalotti” (subtitles were blurred). Not all the movies listed on KLM website were available. The meal service was mediocre. I asked for both white wine and red wine with my meal, and the FA said, “One drink at a time.” Later, I finished my white wine and called an FA (they finished distributing meals by then), but nobody came. They just ignore your calls. I usually fly with Cathay to Europe, but I couldn’t because of the ongoing situation in Hong Kong, so I chose KLM. Bad mistake! Flying Blue is a joke. You get very little % of actual mileage, and the mileage expires. Was not happy at all!

### "The food was outright horrible"
Worst value for money amongst the vast majority of airlines I have used. I travelled KLM to and from Manila in December 2019. The service on KLM flights generally is a minimum required service level. Staff are polite and practical but adds no elegance or service excellence in any way. The food was outright horrible. I honestly think it was prison grade, a tasteless mushy and grey colored omelette for breakfast and a nasty macaroni for dinner on a 13 hour flight. Really? Can you really not do any better than that. I paid over 1000 euros for a return ticket and got 1 piece of check in luggage. This is unheard of with other international airlines. Are they trying to compete with Ryanair? Perhaps they should measure their standards more by the Middle Eastern airlines. I really wonder whether KLM executives ever travel economy class. If they would I am pretty sure it would be an eye opener and a rude awakening. Whenever I have a choice I will choose other airlines over KLM.

### "Extremely kind staff and good food"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Prague. Great airline, KLM. Flown in economy with very comfortable and super clean seat. Extremely kind staff and good food. Supplied with a good sandwich, free of charge. Asked for more food, gave two sandwiches away for free! Great value for money. Nice entertainment (magazines) and fine selection of food. Great WIFI too. Perfect for European travel!

### "KLM placed us standby"
Amsterdam to Singapore. After buying an upgrade for almost EUR 4000 1 day before departure, KLM placed us standby without letting us know, within 10 minutes after buying ánd paying for the upgrade. KLM downgraded one of us to Economy Class and staff provided us wrong alternative flight information for an alternative flight option would give us right to a fee for delay. They offered us a so called compensation, contrary to their own compensation rules, their opinion is that we should be glad with a KLM voucher and worthless given seats. Their final advice given for next time: ‘check in earlier’.

### "a wonderful flight"
Amsterdam to Bucharest. Had a wonderful flight with KLM. Flight left pretty much on time, friendly crew, smooth flight, good quality warm snack, and lots of legroom in economy plus.

### "attendants were hospitable"
Not Verified |  Dar es Salaam to Toronto via Amsterdam. The aircraft were nice, the meals were nice. The flight attendants were hospitable and courteous. I still give it a 4 stars in terms of value for money since it was a last minute booking in a very busy season. Our baggage was lost (all our 4 bags) from Toronto to Dar es Salaam. We filed a complaint in Dar es Salaam and the Swissport employee  was very courteous and told us we are not able to file compensation since at that time Dar es Salaam was our home country but said that he could deliver the baggage at home. 72 hours later, all 4 bags arrived and one hand luggage that went into the checked baggage. initially 1 came than 2 than 2, than another 2, but we missed delivery since we were sleeping or would have got 3 bags within 48hrs, but all the bags arrived after 72 hours. I dont blame them since we did not need those items right away and the items reached intact, even the unlocked hand luggage.

### "paid extra to choose our seats"
Not Verified |  Edinburgh to Amsterdam. The flight was fine and the staff were lovely, but we had paid extra to choose our seats so we could sit together. At the gate we explained we had been given different rows but they said they couldn’t do anything as the plane had been changed but to complain when we got back. We complained when we got back and they said they couldn’t do anything as we had used the tickets. What a lot of rubbish, were we not meant to get on the flight ?

### "no one got back to me"
Manchester to Barcelona via Amsterdam. The flights on 26th October 19 were on time and comfortable enough for economy class. My issue is that when we arrived in Barcelona my case was damaged. I reported at the KLM desk where I filled in a damage report and was given a claim number. I had to contact KLM via the email on my copy of the claim within a week of making the claim which I did. 21st November 19 I contacted KLM to ask why I had had no response and was told to wait another two weeks for them to contact me. So today 11th December 19 I telephoned their service center and was told by the person dealing with me that she would have to ring Barcelona and could I hold. I stayed on the line for a further 25 minutes and as no one got back to me I hung up.

### "very good and comfortable trip"
Whilst this review covers my trip from Abu Dhabi to Rome via Amsterdam, my comments mainly relate to the Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam flight. On the long leg of our trip, we chose to pay extra for Economy Comfort class seats, which provides more leg room and greater recline. You might only get a couple of inches extra leg room, but it is surprising the difference this can make. Other than the extra leg room/greater seat recline, the service on board is the same as standard economy. The meals on the flight were very good as too was the overall cabin service. In flight entertainment was also good, with enough content to keep you entertained. In summary, our flight to Amsterdam, in Economy Comfort Class, was very good and I managed to get some sleep. Overall, I think it was well worth the extra cost. For our flight from Amsterdam to Rome, there is little to report, given that it is considered a short, domestic flight in Europe. The service was good. No in flight entertainment. A snack was served on the flight. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient. The only minor complaint was the amount of carry on luggage some passengers were allowed to carry on, meaning that most of the overhead lockers were quickly filled and some of our stuff had to placed on the floor. This wasn't a great inconvenience though, but if you had more bulky items, it could have been. This is the first time I have travelled with KLM and I was pleasantly surprised. A very good and comfortable trip.

### "pleased with the quality of service"
Kuala Lumpur to Stockholm via Amsterdam. It was a pleasant journey. We felt welcomed and the crew members are polite and professional. Despite the flight delayed, KLM crew had texted me via WhatsApp, to notify our new booking no. and inform us to reprint the new boarding pass. In additional, after we knew that 2 of my friends who didn't get the same flight as us could have missed the next cruise to Helsinki, i immediately request via WhatsApp on the situation we are facing. KLM crew replied in 7 minutes, all 6 of us got the same flights. Isn't amazing? They had definitely impressed us with the swift response!! As a frequent traveler, we felt that KLM had shown utmost respect to their customer and really care for them. Due to the flight delayed, our baggage was lost too. With the assistance from Mr/Ms Rohit Rai, who is so patient waiting for our response, we manage to get our compensation. We want you to know that we are very pleased with the quality of service your company provides!

### "kind and took care of me"
Amsterdam to Washington in August 2019. I wanted to write this for the crew aboard of the KLM flight I was on. They were kind to me and took care of me. Before I took off I was struggling from a fever, I had to fly back immediately. I arrived on the place and I couldn’t think about how long it was. I am 6’6 sitting in a tight area with a good amount of room but sick as a dog. They came out gave me tons of blankets and made me feel as comfortable as I possible can. I cannot thank them enough for what they have done. You may say they get paid to take care of the passengers, but they did more than take care of their passengers. I would love to find out the crew aboard and thank them personally. I will recommend KLM to all my employees, friends, and family as it was a safe travel and a caring environment!

### "really enjoyed our experience"
We flew Manchester to JFK via Amsterdam and back from Panama. We chose KLM again as we flew them to LIM last year and really enjoyed our experience. Check-in smooth and effortless in Manchester and also has a great lounge, providing a very comfortable environment and good choice to eat and drink. FA's on both flights were brilliant and engaging, had a good chat with all of them who served us. Seats really comfy and in cabin temperature just right. Tasty food served and reasonably good drink selection - service takes about 2 hours for dinner, so leisurely. Had a nice kip on the way to JFK and slept well back form PTY. I'm 5'11 and could stretch out fully lying down.

### "I booked for more legroom"
Aruba to Amsterdam. Beware!! KLM sells seats with extra legroom (surcharge about 150$) which are located in the first row after a wall. They don't mention that they will install baby beds in front of you at this wall. Complaining about this the staff said to me that I booked for more legroom and I have the legroom under the baby bed. The parents of the children behaved like pigs, holding their bare feet on the wall and putting their trash everywhere. A child was banging a cushion several times on to my head but when the crew came by they were smiling and chatting with the family and playing with the children. When I complained again about my situation they told me in a rough manner, that they can't do anything for me. Never again.

### "lot of troubles with our visa"
Not Verified |  Brussels to Delhi via Amsterdam. We had a lot of troubles with our visa, luckily everything got solved the last minute. Unfortunately this meant we only had 20 minutes to catch our transfer flight to Delhi in Amsterdam. During the flight, we were updated by the sincerely concerned stewardesses Laura & Melissa who did everything they could to help, Captain Tromp was amazing: arrived in Amsterdam, he guided my wife and me personally to the second check-in, as he knew we wouldn't have made it that quickly without the authority of a captain next to us. We are extremely grateful for the efforts of an amazing,  empathic KLM-team.

### "very comfortable plane"
Superb service on a very comfortable plane. Attendants are helpful and professional. They keep washrooms clean and are already ready to help passengers. Food was nice enough.

### "Cabin crew are excellent"
Santiago to Manchester via Amsterdam. Considering that KLM and Air France are one company there could not be more difference in their product. KLM is, for me, by far the better product. The biggest perk of flying with KLM is that at the end of the flight the cabin crew come round with a tray of miniature Deft Houses filled with Bols gin! There are I think 100 of these to choose from and each flight offers about 10 different ones. Sitting at the front of the cabin gets first to pick. Cabin crew are excellent and the catering on both short and long haul sectors was very good. The seat on the long haul sector was a lie-flat offering with plenty of storage space. As this was an overnight flight that fact was much appreciated. Transfer at Schipol was smooth and easy and the short hop to Manchester was in the European standard 3x3 narrow body economy seats with the middle one left empty. The only let down was the relatively poor quality of the IFE choices although the large screen was better than many competitors offer.

### "Never flying again with them"
Not Verified | Amsterdam to Vancouver. We use to love KLM. I'm a gold flying blue member. My wife is traveling with a 2 and 3-year-old children. We take front row seats to manage this with minimal disturbance to others. KLM changed the plane and did not give us equivalent seats. All of this without a simple warning. Complete disregard for their customers. Called 3 times. One supposed to get back to me, one hung up, one transferred to nowhere. They really insensitive and show no concern for young children. They even sited seat policy change to justify themselves. Never flying again with them.

### "enjoy this flight very much"
Dublin to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam. Great! This was my second business flight with KLM in 2 months and this one to KL was just as good as my Vancouver flight. I had a bad experience with KLM some years ago and avoided this airline but as my Xiaman flight was grounded (Cat 4 Typhoon at Xiamen airport) I was changed onto this flight. Big thanks to the staff at the Xiamen flight gate who went all out to get me to my destination as I had to be there. The flight crew was absolutely excellent. So professional and attentive. The food excellent, fresh and a good choice. The drinks selection was equally good. The lie-flat seat was just as usual and the IFE had a very wide choice. I did enjoy this flight very much and KLM are back on my radar!

### "recommend this airline"
Brussels to Lyon via Amsterdam. Excellent flight. Friendly crew, frequent flight update from the crew. Very satisfactory snack and drinks. Departed on time, arrived early. Plane very clean and well maintained. I recommend this airline.

### "refused to pay extra expenses"
Amsterdam to Birmingham. My flight was overbooked , so that i had to wait an additional 2 hrs at the airport to catch my next flight. When I finally arrived in Birmingham, my luggage was not there. They've forgotten my luggage at the Amsterdam airport. My house keys and other important items that i needed were in that bag. The bag turned up 3 days later ...  everything was inside at least. KLM refused to pay for the extra expenses i had to pay because they've lost my bag. They say it's not their responsibility. I'm very unhappy + angry.

### "foul mouth steward"
Lima to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam. I was on KL0744 from Lima to Amsterdam on 28th October 2019 and my seat was 19D. The flight started well as usual and I had no complaints for the first half of the flight. In fact, I'm not someone who likes to make fuss however this incident happened to me was a true shock and turned my usual good opinion of KLM to nearly zero. The foul mouth steward who served the front seats and my aisle said 'F' word because I didn't finish my tea. This happened during the second meal KLM served, I asked for a cup of hot tea after finishing the meal but didn't finish it as I was already full. This particular steward who served my aisle took away my dish tray but returned the tea to me, so I politely thanked him and told him I didn't want the tea anymore. However, he said F*** xxx with his lips. I was completely shocked and wasn't sure what I should do at that moment. I was on the verge of asking him to repeat what he had said to me but after thinking twice, I decided to talk to the chief of cabin crew. The chief of cabin crew came and I told him what his crew member had done and he said he would talk to him. A few minutes later, the foul mouth steward came back with a little souvenir of Dutch building telling me that it was a joke with his sneaky smile on face. Instead of a sincere apology, I didn't see any remorseful from him at all. I am so angry at myself that I didn't ask for his name and the name of the chief of cabin crew. I whatsapped KLM during my layover at Amsterdam Airport but don't think I received a fair answer from their people at all. So here I am for SKYTRAX

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Seating configuration is 2-2-2. Seat are very comfortable with a Lie Flat Bed. Inflight food tasty and drinks are plenty to order from the menu. Cabin Crew very friendly, helpful, cheerful and give suggestion when come to meals or drinks choices. Although the cabin crew are mostly senior their service are superb. I will fly with them in Business Class again.

### "checkin experience was very sad"
Amsterdam to Dubai. First the checkin experience was very sad at the airport. The staff was testing some new system and it was not working at all and then they were sending customers to a check-in counter (where only 1 person was sitting) and it was leading to long line. Very bad experience. Then at the checkin date again their system was not working properly and not able to read the passport well and they were least bothered about customer at all. They are advertising big things about 100 years of airlines but very poor staff. Only saving grace was staff in aircraft. The seats were too narrow. My food was bad.

### "requesting a 50% refund"
Houston to Vienna via Amsterdam return. First segment was unable to select seats, tried several times but system would dump them out. Unable to check-in online as advertised. When talking with Delta and KLM agents they seemed uninterested in helping at all, terrible customer service! Changed flights VIE to IAH from 20 Oct to 17 Oct, was charged $500 change fee and the nightmare began. Unable to select seats, unable to check-in online, via app, or at VIE kiosk. Talked with Delta and KLM customer service six times all within 24hr of flight and nobody was able to correct these issues. Delta and KLM agents did not seem to care. Walked 1/2 mile to KLM counter in VIE took 20 minutes to check-in, "could not find in system". KL1838 no provisioning on aircraft. Asked for water and was told there was none, meanwhile flight attendants drank bottled water and made hot tea for pilots in plain view of Business pax. KL 661 no seat assigned, had to sit in last row behind coach galleys. Terrible experience! Will never fly on KLM again! Customer service non-existent! Requested a refund of change fee to no avail. Now requesting a 50% refund of roudtrip fare.

### "Definitely fly with KLM again"
Not Verified |  Athens to Aberdeen via Amsterdam. Great airline. Was really impressed with them from the lovely friendly staff to the food you get on board. I usually fly with BA but after the way I was treated during the computer failure and after was appalling so I will not fly with then again. I was also impressed with the usb charging ports on the KLM flight from Athens to Amsterdam. Definitely fly with KLM again.

### "A mess for a weekend trip"
Zurich to Bucharest via Amsterdam. First flight heavily delayed, the second a little. All due to a runway repair. I was able to do the connection, my luggage did not, although there were 50 minutes time in between. It was then not even on the next flight but on the second, so that I got it just 23 hours later. A mess for a weekend trip, flying back just 12 hours later. The flights themselves were unspectacular and of good quality. Always nice crews on these KLM flights.

### "our luggage didn’t come"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Delhi via Amsterdam. It was my first experience with KLM which was really worst. When we landed in Delhi our luggage didn’t come, we made a complaint about it and it’s been 15 days but they are unable to track our luggage. After 5 days I have to go back to Canada but they are unable to give any response. Customer care is so poor they never call about the status of the bag. Such a shame on big airlines like this a person is traveling for 20 days if somehow the bag is lost you will not get any response or any claim before 21 days.

### "awful overall experience"
Delta partner KLM Charged me for my luggage on return flight saying it’s their policy even though I purchased the ticket from Delta but got on KLM. Food was small tiny frozen plastic containers with boiled rice and disgusting smelling 3 pieces of chicken with small muffin was served on 11 hours international flights and nothing else. Such an unhealthy and shamefully discussing choice. Thankfully I had some nuts in my bag to munch on. The seats on KLM are so small and closed together that I was shoulder to shoulder with other passengers and I’m a small size person so were the other passengers. I couldn’t put my back seat lower because the person behind me has no space for his legs and he was an average size person. It was an awful overall experience.

### "pretty messy in case of failures"
Helsinki to Dublin via Amsterdam. Ground services are nasty (especially in Dublin), forced people to check in a hand luggage even it was following KLM standards. Pretty inaccurate and irresponsible of the schedule, they are unable to handle delays. Ground services in Amsterdam had given a worse route as a replacement of original one and provide support after delay happens. Nice to deal with KLM only on direct routes, pretty messy in case of failures.

### "first and also the last time"
This is the first and also the last time I fly KLM I have 2 pieces of carryon. Did not know KLM policy of 12 kg total for carry on. At KLM ticketing, they did not tell us. And then made us check in the luggage at the gate. They profiled people, my friends. I saw others just went through with 2 pieces of luggage, looked heavier than mine. Be careful if you book KLM. I usually flew Delta and got shuttles to KLM and did not realize. KLM you fooled me once but not twice. I will never fly on KLM again.

### "Would fly with them again"
Delta flight from New York to Amsterdam operated by KLM. Smooth boarding, clean aircraft, refitted business class with full-flat seats. The new design looks simple with some elements like a plastic flower in the lavatory making it look cheap. The cabin crew was attentive and friendly. Decent choice of movies. Food was good (s. photos), nicely presented. The seat was quite comfortable. A nice touch in the end - ceramic traditional Dutch house to collect (a total of 99 models with 1 more coming to match 100 years of KLM history). Unimpressive new design and lack of wifi (in 2019!) are the major minuses, but overall, the flight left a good impression. Would fly with them again.

### "Upgraded with no meal"
Stavanger to Glasgow via Amsterdam. Upgraded with no meal made to look like a fool. There was no upgrade it was only done as the plane was full. I was degraded then I spent 1 hour on the phone talking the same thing over and over again to get no help. Worst airline I have ever dealt with I would avoid.

### "really poor customer service"
Amsterdam to Basel. The online booking procedure is confusing and irritating. There should be a flexibility option available but it simply isn't. The procedure seems to alter, though it is impossible to find out what the alterations depend on. The webchat "support" I just experienced was rather indifferent, in fact, so indifferent that it was borderline rude. The phone support was rather kind and eager to help at first but ultimately also couldn't solve the issue (the phone call went on for over 40 minutes, I quit after having been put on hold for about 15 minutes). Long story short: the KLM booking procedure is a mess, the customer support are clueless and whether or not one can add flexibility to the booking seems to purely depend on chance/circumstance. This all adds up to really, really poor customer service.

### "Overall a very bad experience"
Prague to Moscow via Amsterdam on September 23rd. I purchased KLM ticket to Moscow via Amsterdam and have SkyTeam Elite Plus status. When check in for the flight in Prague, I have learned that the flight is codeshare and operated by CSA. Much to my surprise, I have been rejected to check my luggage through to Moscow and was explained, that CSA does not have an agreement with KLM. Therefore, I have to leave the terminal in Amsterdam and drop off my luggage again in Amsterdam. Due to this, I had to cancel my meeting in Amsterdam and have to deal with my luggage rather than with my business. Strangely enough, I have been checked in through to Moscow, unlike my luggage. Both companies are SkyTeam members. I would expect, if KLM is selling flight from Prague to Moscow as one KLM trip, they should also secure seamless transfer in Amsterdam. Moreover, CSA flight is operated by Smartwings. Consequently, you buy ticket to end up in a 2 star lowcost airlines, which does not allow even change your the seat for free. Instead of, I was automatically assigned a seat close to toilets. Overall a very bad experience. KLM should think in terms of customer experience rather than on its 100 years anniversary.

### "The crew was excellent"
Bangkok via Amsterdam. I have nothing to complain. The crew was excellent, they spoke perfect English and were always smiling and helpful. Someone behind us had a birthday and they brought her two bottles of sparkling wine, a card and cookies. They served a small warm meal and a muffin+coffee on our journey from Helsinki to Amsterdam which is only a 2h flight. The meals were very nice, pretty standard airplane food.

### "Attentive, friendly and cheerful crew"
Booked Oman Air, got KLM. When I checked I saw that this flight booked via Oman Air was much cheaper than booked via KLM, so that might be worth a check. The only disadvantage is that you can't reserve a seat, but that turned out to be no problem at all. Long Q at the automated check in, since in our row only one ground staff member was assisting. In another row a saw a second. Still at the gate within the hour of entering Schiphol Airport. The flight to Muscat makes a stop in Dammam (KSA) on both legs, so the total travel time is around 9 hrs. A330 had good leg room and a wide range of movies. We got a rather tasty lunch and a snack and I counted three rounds of drinks on the outbound flight, which could have been more. Inbound, two nice snacks and a breakfast, which wasn't very good. Plenty of drinks, so that was better. Attentive, friendly and cheerful crew on both flights. You can see that the crewmembers like their jobs. Speaking of that: in the weeks before we flew there were three strikes by KLM ground staff at Schiphol and there were threats of more strikes. The payment conflict still isn't solved, so that might by a consideration to book a different airline when possible. I liked KLM very much but am hesitant to book again, because of the threat of strikes.

### "lose the connection to Copenhagen"
Valencia to Copenhagen via Amsterdam. I have flied with KLM only three times, a round trip and a single trip, look what happened to me: Copenhagen to Valencia: the flight to Valencia, the flight to Amesterdam is delayed, so we didn't catch the flight to Valencia, 5 hours delay, they even didnt give a snack for compensation; the flight back, they hadn't sent the luggage so they had to deliver it the day after Single journey from Venecia to Copenhagen: I was with my family so I prefered to get KLM instead of going to Milan and get a direct flight, KLM was an expensive option but I preferred for the comfort of my parents, I also said ok my previous experience was just a coincident, and here I am, again the flight to Amsterdam is late, so we lose the connection to Copenhagen and we will be late for 3 hours, in three hours I could have gone to Milan and then take a much cheaper direct flight

### "made no effort to get me home"
Not Verified | Zurich to Norwich via Amsterdam. Original return flight cancelled and the airline rebooking meant a one day delay in getting home. Working with a travel agent meant an additional stop but should have gotten me home on time. Further delays meant that I will now not get home until 12 hours later than booked. To make matters worse, the airline chose to bus dozens of passengers to a hotel more than 30 minute from the airport rather than a hotel closer to the airport (many of which had rooms, according to Internet booking sites). Any airline can fly you from A to B, it is how an airline performs when the chips are down that matter. I can't see that KLM did one thing right - they made no effort to get me home on time, they met their customer service obligations in the most cost effective manner for them - nothing taking the customer into account.

### "Food was good"
Flew Fortaleza to London Heathrow via Amsterdam Schipol in J/Business: FOR to AMS on an A330: On-time departure. Clean aircraft. Solicitous crew. Good IFE. Pre-dinner wine was a disappointment. Food was good (better than British Airways) but again the wine with it was a disappointment (I think KLM are cutting corners here - British Airways definitely have better wine). The bed was fully lie-flat and long but a bit narrow/pinched at the shoulders, so much so that it interfered with attempts to sleep. Decent breakfast. Admirably short and to-the-point announcements (many airlines e.g. British Airways, Emirates) have far too many interruptions. AMS-LHR sector was fine on a 737 except for a late departure, blamed on a lack of ATC capacity on the inbound. On arrival at LHR my bags had been badly beaten up but I am not sure by who.

### "delighted by the kindness"
Amsterdam to São Paulo. We traveled to Amsterdam in September / 19 on KLM. It was our first flight with this company. Both on and off we were delighted by the kindness and attention of the cabin crew. From the moment they passed the departure gate smiling and greeting everyone, including in Portuguese until the farewell at the final destination. The drinks and meals were spotless. Very good movie options, and video attractions, but the "icing on the cake" was the memory they gave us of Amsterdam. The famous Delft Blue houses. We already have four! I hope to increase the collection in the next trips. Thank you KLM and congratulations on your 100th birthday! | Viajamos para Amsterdam em setembro/19 pela KLM. Foi nosso primeiro vôo com essa companhia. Tanto na ida quanto na volta ficamos encantados com a simpatia, gentileza e atenção da equipe de comissários da cabine. Desde o momento em que passaram pelo portão de embarque sorrindo e cumprimentando à todos, inclusive em português até a despedida no destino final. As bebidas e refeições estavam impecáveis. As opções de filmes, e atrações no vídeo muito boas, mas a "cereja do bolo" foi a lembrança que nos deram de Amsterdam. As famosas Delf Blue houses.Já temos quatro! Espero aumentar a coleção nas próximas viagens. Obrigada, KLM e parabéns pelos 100 anos no ar!

### "Love you KLM"
Not Verified | Houston to Barcelona via Amsterdam. My Family and I were supposed to have a connection to Zurich and then onwards to Barcelona. Until there was one problem. Swiss Air's aircraft had a mechanical problem and everyone was rushing to the check-in. It looked like everyone was going to Zurich as their final destination. There was a very long line. My sister was very sick but KLM let us in through their line. All of the cabin crew were awesome. We arrived to BCN safely. Love you KLM!

### "Cramped with little leg room"
Paris to Amsterdam. Cramped with little leg room. Dinner came in a box, which I refused. There is also little room available in the overhead compartment due to extra payments to be made for check in baggage. Fortunately, it was only an hour’s flight - but definitely not comfortable.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Oslo to Luxembourg via Amsterdam. I have flown with KLM several times and it always have had delay. Last time because of my first delayed flight (20-30 minutes) I missed my short connected flight (one hour stop between flights so by this delay I only had approximately 15 minutes to get to the gate before it's closed) and KLM staff at Amsterdam airport were not helpful and behaved very rude with me and instead of compensation, they said it was your own fault that you missed the flight and you had enough time to get to the gate, we should claim compensation from you because you didn'tbshow up at the gate! That was really rude. They kept me waiting for 4 hours and put me on the waiting list of next KLM flight same evening that if somebody doesn't show up at the gate I could go instead, it didn't work out though, and finally they gave me a confirmed ticket for next day morning with KLM, they didn't give me hotel either so i had to stay at the airport all the night. They didn't even give me the opportunity for flights with other airlines and only looked for KLM flights and they make this much trouble and inconvenience for passengers with their delays.

### "Service from the cabin crew seemed very rushed"
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Flight with KLM is not as beautiful as I imagined. The boarding process is so complicated and takes a long time. Service from the cabin crew seemed very rushed. When I asked for a cup of tea, they said they would immediately deliver it to me but until the plane landed in Jakarta the tea I asked for never came. The seat is a bit narrow with a 3-4-3 configuration. But I still recommend this airline if you want to fly with a full service airline but at a friendly price.

### "Seats were really tight"
Amsterdam to Paris with KLM. 45 mins to drop off luggage due to the massive queue. The plane was old - fortunately the flight was only 50 minutes. Sad sandwiches for lunch. Seats were really tight - it’s a true cattle class but bearable for 50 minutes.

### "very unhappy with KLM"
Hanover to Vancouver via Amsterdam. I bought a KLM roundtrip ticket online from Germany and paid 1200€ and bought a flexible option. But now, when I want to change my return date, they don’t accept it, despite paying for a flexible changeable ticket. Now, I have to buy a new ticket and I’ll miss this flight completely. I’m very unhappy with KLM.

### "Seat very thin but comfortable"
Amsterdam to Kigali. Check- in via Whatsapp, seat reservation quite expensive, best seats already taken, inside, not taken seats are blocked. Seat is very thin but comfortable, own touchscreen, but lousy earphones, medium selection of movies etc. Food was disgusting, drink service so so. Toilets extremely small.

### "second class airline service"
Not Verified |  Durham Tees Valley to Cape Town via Amsterdam. KLM used to be a first class airline, and having traveled with them for over fifteen years without a single complaint, now find that in the past eighteen months they are devolving into a second class airline service. Passengers part with large sums of money sometimes months in advance of travel and one of the perks used to that the passenger could pick their set at the time of booking. I think a fair gesture give that KLM will have the Customers money in their bank. The the introduction of having to pay for the seat came in. The introduction of a cost for "Preferred" seating. All as KLM say for the interests of travelers by offering more choice. The cessation last September (2018) of the welcome on board drinks service. I did not think that the food could get any worse, but it has. I would like to invite their CEO to try the infamous pizza slice served on the Schiphol to Cape Town flight. A meal I have endured for the past ten years. And now the final straw, the introduction of a "Cost" to check in a bag. How long before a cost to use the toilet, or maybe the cost for the use of a knife and fork. Customers could always use their fingers. Who is thinking up this deplorable degrading service. And try using their Customer Service to complain. Utter utter waste of time. They ask stupid question which can be done through the Flying Blue membership.

### "really enjoyed all four flights"
Taipei to Lisbon via Amsterdam and return. The ambience of the aircrafts was nice and quiet. The service was good. The seats were very comfortable. The food and drinks were fresh and healthy. I really enjoyed all four flights!

### "The worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Copenhagen to Glasgow via Amsterdam. The worst customer service experience of my life belongs to KLM & City Bags. Nevertake a KLM 40 minute transfer through Amsterdam. You might make your flight but if your bags don't you won't see them for days, you'll spend hours on hold waiting to find out nothing and nobody will at any point initiate contact with you. After 5 days of utter incompetence and total indifference from both KLM & City Bags I called the Police. I asked if I could report them stolen, get an incident number and claim my insurance. They called a contact at Glasgow Airport and 20 minutes later I was given the location of the courier and collected the bags myself. I raised a complaint directly with KLM which was closed automatically because the bags were with the courier. They completely abdicated all responsibility and should be held to account for using such a shambolic courier service.

### "seats terrible to sit and rest in"
Berlin to Cape Town via Amsterdam. Very mixed experience with KLM. I liked the airline for three reasons, they have nice staff, often very good deals, and it's relaxing in their planes, at least I thought so. On this trip, staff was super-friendly, charming, and pleasant That certainly is a big plus. Food and entertainment were ok, but nothing to speak of. What’s really annoying/disturbing/painful are the seats in their Boeing's. They are terrible to sit and rest in, of lowest possible quality (tray table, for instance, would not fit back in front seat) and super uncomfortable. As most decent European carriers have their Airbus fleet, I haven’t been in a Boeing on a long-haul flight for a while, and I must say it’s just painful. Other than that flights were uneventful and on time.

### "threatened to off board me"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Singapore. Very rude customer service. They threatened to off board me because I was reading my kindle during take off. The hostess was scared the kindle would slip my hand and reach her head. A kindle is lighter than a book (which the other passengers did read) and I would assume if the stop is so strong she would most probably have to handle much more than a kindle slipping from hands. They could not provide any rules around this specific ask and still were threatening to off board.

### "horrible customer service"
Toronto to Amsterdam. Absolutely horrible customer service! They canceled my plane (not delayed just cancelled) making me late for wedding and missing my connection in Amsterdam and now I have no way to get back either and no one there is willing to help! What a joke! Never fly with them.

### "unscrupulous and devious"
Not Verified |  KLM having changed their website earlier this year have made it very difficult for passengers to clearly understand the Terms and Conditions. Having travelled with KLM for over 15 years primarily to Cape Town and Europe have always understood that the cost of the ticket includes one checked in bag per person (23kilos) and hand baggage. My wife and I have just fallen foul of their atrocious web site after all of these years of loyal travel with them. Having travelled down to Cape Town we had to pay for a check in bag on the return flight at a cost of £60.00 in addition to the ticket. As I am a Flying Silver member I am entitled to an extra checked in bag which they refused and insisted that my wife had to pay for her bag. It transpires that many customers are falling foul of this new rule. So, anyone travelling with KLM beware. This is an unscrupulous and devious behaviour. I have spent all day complaining in writing and they now say one of the bags was one kilo over weight. But say nothing of the bag which was only 16kilos. This was never brought to our attention at check in. My combined check is 46 kilos. KLM have also reduces the on board staff making the inflight service very very slow. They have ceased the welcome on board drinks service, very welcome on a long haul flight. Reduced the standard of the food. Introduced a cost for selecting a preferred seat (standard seat) which used to be free for passengers booking ten months in advance which considering KLM have banked the money is a small reward for passengers booking early, The food quality has diminished considerably. This was not a good end to an enjoyable break. We used to sing the praises of KLM. But no longer. Having just checked our trip with KLM for February 2020, we have discovered we have no checked in baggage for the outward bound flight, but do have checked in luggage for the return flight. Come on KLM what on earth are you up to?

### "Will never fly them again"
Kilimanjaro to Amsterdam in July. Worst flight of my life. Had a passenger get on and worst body odor ever, it literally made me ill. Flight attendants thought it was funny. Sprayed light mist in my area and then laughed when I sat on flight attendant jump seat for 4 hours. Would not move me and I offered to pay for any other seat on the plane. Could not eat, drink, or do anything the entire flight. I have contacted KLM multiple times about this and they don't care. Will never fly them again. Flight attendants did their basic duties and that is all - no interest in helping me. Cannot rate the food, drink or entertainment as I could not eat or drink due to the overwhelming smell.

### "found KLM to be satisfactory"
Not Verified | My family and I flew Tel Aviv to Bali via Amsterdam for our holiday. We were with 10 of us in total. We found KLM to be satisfactory. We had a long layover in Amsterdam. The service on the ground and in the air were good, special meal kosher food can be better though. No toys provided for the kids. The flight made a stop in Singapore, we all had to disembark and embark again which was a bit of a hassle.

### "very unwilling to help"
Consistently late in regional flights, rude personnel at the Amsterdam airport and most importantly very unwilling to help solve booking/passenger issues. I tried changing the name on my suitcase booked under my girlfriend's name and they just told me very rudely that this is impossible. I've done it before on various other airlines and it has never been a problem before. For a ticket that costs so much I would expect a better customer service . Never again for me, there are plenty other options to fly nowadays.

### "KLM has improved so much"
Flight from IAD to AMS was abolutely delightful. Although fully booked there was plenty of space. Seats comfortable. Service was superb which was a nice surprise. KLM has improved so much. Food was ok. Transfer im AMS was easy. Flight AMS to BSL just as good as the previous. All in all a very nice experience.

### "KLM is a terrible company"
Gothenburg to Lima via Amsterdam. KLM has done wrong by us on all parts below: On the flight April 10th 2019 from Amsterdam to Sweden my wife didn’t get any notice about that her flight was canceled until after the flight time. Then she got a new flight the day after but no stay at a hotel over the night which mainly is KLM policy. The day after on flight to Sweden her bag got stuck in transfer in Amsterdam. We called KLM about this and they said that we are entitled to 100 euros for every day the bag still was missing and that we would get back the money if we attach the receipts. One day later the bag came to us totally broken. We took pictures of the bag and sent it to KLM and asked for a refund our bag several times. The answer we got was: "I note that you incurred additional expenses due to delay baggage. We will be pleased to reimburse the direct expenses. Additionally, in regards to your damage baggage, we would be grateful if you could send us the following supporting documents: The receipt for the cost of repair to your baggage or a written confirmation from any nearest stockiest with the following specifications: 1. The age and the current value of the damaged baggage 2. The type of damage inflicted to the bag 3. A confirmation that the suitcase cannot be satisfactorily repaired 4. The original purchase receipt for the damaged case" Then they sent us to the same website we got this answer from. We don't have the purchase receipt and we shouldn't need it, because we didn't break it. They broke it and they should pay with the amount for a similar bag, around 100 euros. When we bought a new flight in June 2019 the website didn't work. On the website they offer a Premium package where you can change your flight without the extra fine on 150 euros and only pay for the difference in flight price. It also included the benefits of choosing the seats. I had to call to book the same flight as I tried to book on the website but on the phone they said the option to skip the fine wasn't available. I later had to change the flight and also had to pay the fine. When I tried to book the flight through the website there was an error but the money was reserved from my card. And I had to wait two business days and because of that, the ticket price raised with 200 euros. To sum everything up: KLM is a terrible company who never takes any responsibility for their actions and tries to shower their poor customers in bureaucracy instead of helping them out when they have made mistakes. Next time, I rather fly around the world than taking KLM again.

### "the worst flight experience"
Amsterdam to Wroclaw was the worst flight experience I have ever had. The first thing I have to tell about is the extra luggage I bought before the trip, but I couldn’t even put my small bag close to the seat. So cabin crew without an apology asked me to put it in front of the plane, but my seat was far away from there. And I was not the only one passenger who had such a problem. During the flight cabin crew asked what drinks we would like to order. To some guests they given 2 bottles of wine per person and 2 pieces of cake they prepared for the flight, for others one bottle and one cake. when we asked about the possibility to order 2 bottles what was the answer? Excuse me, but we have limited quantity, so we can give only one per person.” Why someone of guests located close to us without any Golden Flying blue cards and so on, have more advantages than others? And also I cannot mention the behavior of cabin crew. It was not professional to treat all guests different and also I am not sure about their English knowledges. For me it seams to be strange that I have to repeat phrases twice. That is not the treat I expected for. And definitely it doesn’t have nothing to share with worlds “royal airlines”.

### "upgrades aren't what they seem"
Toronto to Amsterdam. I have flown KLM about three times (return) in the past years since moving to Germany. Each time something goes wrong. I've had delays twice between 3-5 hours, I've been told different things by the customer service on the phone that suddenly are told different by the staff in person on the day (once I was forced to wait 13 hours in Amsterdam because of this) and just this past week I fell for their unclear advertising and was again mislead by conflicting statements by the customer service. As I checked in online for my flight, I was offered an upgrade to business class for only 89€, almost too good to be true, but as it was only a few hours before the flight, I assumed they were hoping to get rid of the seats. Just having gotten engaged and bought a house, my fiancee and I decided to spend the €178 to celebrate and get some sleep over the ocean. After we paid, however, we got business class only for the connecting 45 minute flight from Paris to Amsterdam! Not at all what originally was offered for 89€ each. We called the service number and were told it happens often, and we would get our money back when we talk to the service desk in Paris. So we flew economy over the ocean but in randomly assigned middle seats (at the back where the veggie meals had run out) and got no sleep. In Paris, they told us that the customer service was wrong and they would not give us our money back. We decided our luck was bad and we would enjoy the business class anyway, but on this small plane, the business class had seats identical to the economy, just without someone beside you. And there was a small breakfast, which we couldn't finish because the flight was so short! All in all a waste of money, and beware of "upgrades" that aren't what they seem! It's how they make money! At least the service is always friendly.

### "one of the best airlines"
Not Verified |  Tel Aviv to Bogota via Amsterdam. For me KLM is one of the best airlines. Service is outstanding. The staff is very profesional, very attentive and receptive to the customer needs. All is nice and clean. Its a pleasure to flight with KLM and I will do it again in the future.

### "I didn't use the first flight"
After purchasing two flights Madrid to Amsterdam return, the company decides to cancel my second flight without not letting me know. The reason why they excused doing that was that I didn't use the first flight. This company has sold my sit in the plane (without communicating to me supposing that I will have not to show up in the second flight) and refused to give me the refund or provide me with other flight tickets.

### "superior to Delta"
Not Verified |  We flew Delta 1 to Barcelona, and then KLM world business from Amsterdam to Atlanta. the experience with KLM was so superior to Delta, that we will go out of our way to fly Klm

### "offered me a seat in business class"
Toulouse to Amsterdam. First, staff were wandering around attaching tags to people's carry on bag that you would be guaranteed to take your cabin baggage on board as long as you stowed under the seat in front of you. Then, as people started boarding, it was chaos, as people went through boarding they were then stopped  to see if they had been tagged. This slowed everyone down even further. I decided to wait to the very end to board given I had paid extra for a seat up front (6F) and didn't want to be caught in the crush. When I did board, there was a still a queue of people waiting to board the plane. Why, because of the crazy boarding operation. When I finally boarded he plane, the captain made an announcement that passengers needed to hurry up so the plane would not miss its departure slot or we would be delayed up to 30 minutes. By the time I reached my seat, I sat down quickly. I watched passengers with children negotiating with others to swap seats so their families wouldn't be split up. And then, a father approached me to ask me to move so he could sit with his two children. I was frustrated having paid more for my seat, having been organised months in advance, and waited until last to board the plane to avoid any issues. I was angry by his demanding nature. I said no. Then he carried on to flight attendants and created a scene. So, feeling sorry for him, I stood up, and said where do you want me to sit then. It was seat 23E. This was in between two passengers, which I hate. I had a window seat. Then when I made my way down the back, I saw an empty window seat and asked the FA if I could sit there. She was angry with me because she didn't know what was going on or why I was moving. And she said she wasn't sure if all the passengers had boarded. Fed up, I said "You know what, I am evicted from my seat by a demanding father, I paid extra for that seat six months in advance, and now maybe I should just stand all the way to Amsterdam. Suddenly, she said to have the window seat. I shouted this for all the plane to hear. After take off, the purser apologised profusely. I told her exactly what I thought of KLM's boarding procedure. I also told her that parents should not be demanding others move. It is up the staff at check-in to sort this out or the boarding staff or FA, not other passengers. She agreed and told me she had told him to wait until we took off given we were about to leave and his last minute arrival on the place. But he was as usual, feeling entitled. She offered me a seat in business class to compensate and went out of her way to ensure I was okay. She was lovely and very embarrassed for me. She also acknowledged that the other passenger had been totally in the wrong to do what he did. However, given the chaotic boarding operation, perhaps he was just as caught out as I was.

### "would especially recommend if you need special assistance"
Not Verified |  I had a daughter with a wheelchair with me and I found them extremely helpful, we had connecting flights with another airline so I could compare and KLM were the best with helping with my daughter, did not make me feel like a burden or troublesome at all. All the staff I met from checkout to cabin crew and in Amsterdam airport were super friendly and helpful all the way. I would definitely travel with them again and would especially recommend if you need special assistance.

### "so angry with the customer services"
Helsinki to Cardiff to via Amsterdam. I am so angry with the customer services of KLM so i want to write. My flight was been canceled on 25.7 they arrange me next flight on 26.7. A guy in KLM service counter in Helsinki airport told me I am eligible to get 400 euro refund from this changes so I apply for reclamation last week. Since then i am trying to find out my status of my refund process. I have been calling several times to customer service but it was one of the awful costumer services i have ever been dealing in my whole life time. Lady on my phone tells me she will transfer my call then hang up my call. This didn't happen one or two time but several times. They are so so irresponsible.

### "problems started at the check in"
Nice to Prague via Amsterdam. The problems started already at the check in. I could not drop off my luggage as the flight was to be delayed until further notice. After several postponements we were finally able to board the plane at around 8pm, although we were supposed to fly at 5pm. This meant of course that I will miss my connection and I was rebooked for the next day already before departure from NCE. Anyway, when already seated in plane we were waiting for more than an hour more before take off. The information from cockpit were kind, but useless. Incredible but true, the second KLM flight that was supposed to fly two hours after ours, took off before ours. We arrived to Amsterdam around midnight, i.e. 3 hours delay. Nobody waited for us at the gate, although it was promised they will. We were left to the unfriendly security staff, that sent us wrong way. When I finally got to transfer desk another chock: no hotel for me, although they knew for more that 5 hours already that I am arriving. I must book it by myself and if I don't have money I must sleep at airport.

### "not had any issue with KLM"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Dubai via Amsterdam. Over the last five years I have been traveling on KLM every 3 months between Toronto and Dubai via Amsterdam. I have not had any issue with KLM. KLM customer service has been great. A few examples are storing my carry on when there is lack of space in the over head bins,  going out of their way to provide me with the Heineken-KLM 100 special can, getting the meal that i pre-ordered, surprise business class upgrade, personable service, asking for a meal later on, in the even I fall asleep during regular meal service. No airline comes close to the service levels of KLM for me. I am happy with the amount of entertainment on KLM, happy with the meals, legspace, comfort, service of staff.

### "a cheap no frills airline"
Glasgow to Kiev via Amsterdam. KLM are a cheap no frills airline. If they loose your case, and they probably will, don't expect compensation, if the online check in doesn't work, expect to pay a boarding charge and if ground crew say talk to customer service about a refund, don't waste your time, expect a polite reply in 2 weeks saying they are very sorry but essentially they don't care. With the exception of a complimentary sandwich it's got all the class of Ryanair, without the upfront honesty. I'd honestly pick any other airline if your route allows.

### "Diabolical customer service"
Not Verified |  Leeds to Bremen via Amsterdam. Diabolical customer service. I’m a flying blue passenger and work overseas. Flew out in April and they lost my luggage a didn’t get it for 4 days. Had to buy new clothes and toiletries as they promised they would be reimbursed. It’s now the end of July and I haven’t heard anything apart from wrong bank details which is funny because my salary gets there every month. Won’t give KLM another Dime.

### "rip you off for a little bit of cash"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to St. Petersburg via Amsterdam. FRA to AMS flight delayed 3 hrs 10 minutes. Therefore we missed our connecting KLM flight to St Petersburg LED. KLM gave us, after 1 night in AMS hotel we paid by ourselves, a connecting flight to LED which caused delay of 16 hrs and missing our prepaid hotel in St. Petersburg. No support at AMS airport, very rude staff although we used business class. Worst of all we lost 1 complete day of our holidays. To top this very sad story we exchanged now 27 mails with KLM. Once they say compensation is 600 EUR per person. Then they wrote us our 20 years old bank account "was incorrect". Then they tell us compensation is 250 EUR. After that they overrule themselves by saying compensation is 400 EUR. We sent them KLM all personal, flights and bank details. We never received any compensation from them or at least any excuse for this catastrophe. Avoid this airline in all circumstances. They make you mad with 100s of paperwork completely red tape style just to prevent you from getting your rights under EU legislation. Those employees of KLM obviously do not understand their work. They rip you off for a little bit of cash.

### "KLM has gotten out of control"
KLM has gotten out of control recently. It maybe mainly Schiphol overloaded, but I had frequent delays (one more than three hours) and now with the fuel issue at Schiphol a full black out. They were disorganized, not helping, I am back home since yesterday by train and a flight from Dusseldorf to MUC, all done by myself. Now today I receive a note, that I have been re-booked for the earliest return on Saturday (tomorrow). This is completely crazy. Avoid KLM, avoid Schiphol. It is simply over capacity and under organizational capability!

### "nothing but headaches"
On the way from Amsterdam to Munich, the plane was too hot because the air conditioning had broken. Instead of letting us off the plane, they made us sit in place for almost two hours before unloading us and making us walk across the airport to the next flight. No big deal, but the heat inside and then the rush to reboard could have been dangerous Then, from Munich to Amsterdam, everyone on the flight was forced to check our carry ons with no compensation or credit. This airline is nothing but headaches. Also, on the flight they give you about 30ml of drinking water. I won't be flying with this airline again.

### "Complete lack of response"
Honestly the worst flight experience of my life. Not only were we delayed over 3 hours, but they kept us on a plane in the summer with a/c malfunction while heat blasted the cabin to 100°F, for an hour. Everyone was covered in sweat and felt faint from the heat while they made us stay and wait while they tried to fix it. I am young and even I had a headache, I can’t imagine an elderly person being able to breathe in those conditions. Complete lack of response to a dangerous situation. They seriously wanted to put that plane in the air. They handed out tiny cups of water and apologized. Then finally had us get on another plane. Not to mention they checked our carry on luggage because they ran out of room. Do not fly with KLM. Nothing but trouble.

### "so insulted and humiliated"
Amsterdam to Bangkok. I have never been so insulted and humiliated as on my recent flight after 29 years of long haul travel. Everyone has their plan of dealing with time zones and jet lag etc. Mine is to have the meal, watch a movie, a decent length sleep and wake 2 hours before landing for breakfast. It is a plan that has served me well. I had a glass of wine with the early nibbles and when the stewardess came with the starter she asked if I wanted anything else to drink as if most people would be happy with 1 glass of wine in a 10.5 hour trip. Mind, apart from bringing the food, we didn’t see much of her apart from a quick walk through very occasionally but eyes upwards so no-one could ask her to do anything. After the meal I sat quietly finishing off the film with some wine. 45 minutes before sleep time I asked for a glass of wine to help me get off to sleep at a strange time. I was just sitting quietly watching a film. The purser came with the glass of wine and said, and this is in business class, “this is not a free bar and I have been told you have had enough wine and you won’t get any more”. You can’t begin to guess my astonishment, treating me like a drunkard when I am one of the best, most polite people you could ever meet. Insulting and humiliating doesn’t really begin to describe it. During breakfast the purser tried to apologise saying he had got it all wrong but I wasn’t interested, the damage had been done.

### "best described as adequate"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Sandefjord via Amsterdam. First leg of the flight, DUB-AMS, was operated a plane from Stobart Air, with a KLM crew. Upon check-in, I was informed of a 25 minute delay but that I should be able to make my booked connections. However, at the gate, the delay just kept getting longer and longer. As I was standing around, I received an email informing me that my flight would not make the original connection to CPH and that I had automatically been re-booked onto another flight, however this meant I would miss my rail connection to Sweden. The gate staff were not able to do much, as they were only local Irish contractors and not KLM staff. The delay was progressively made later and later. The flight was almost 2 hours late and was causing great stress and worry for me about being stranded in CPH. Only suggestion was to see the transfer desk in Amsterdam, who were helpful and professional. I asked if I could be rebooked onto Oslo, but initially they said it was booked out. They had only been looking at OSL and did not even consider TRF, until I suggested it. It was a very late flight option but it was better than everything else presented to me. The delayed DUB-AMS Stobart Air flight was best described as adequate. It was quite obvious that the air crew were thrown together and were disjointed in their operations. However they were very professional in their appearance and interactions with the passengers. The AMS-TRF flight was a proper KLM flight, on the same plane type. The aircrew were much better than the first, most likely because of working together before. Thankfully so, to ease my nerves from the first leg.

### "it was a great flight"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Lima, it was a great flight enough legroom and great service! The food was good we got enough drinks in 12 hours. The movies where all new movies, just came out of the cinema. Great flight good experience.

### "have started avoiding KLM"
Stavanger to Alicante via Oslo in April 2019. For many years I have been flying exclusively with KLM just because they were the most helpful with nice crew and customer service. After this flight I have started avoiding KLM as much as possible. I simply called customer service to ask about the luggage condition for the ticket I booked online. The lady on the phone told me she has no information and told me to go and read on the website. I asked where on the website and how do I know that what I read there is applied to my ticket? Again, She said she has no information and everything is on the website. I called the complaints line and perhaps the same lady answered because I explained the situation and she said they cannot offer help for each individual and all the info is online. I just do not understand why they cannot find info about a ticket that I already booked. How hard it can be. It feels like KLM somehow in the past few years has replaced the helpful and nice crew with a cheap and rude one.

### "cheaper than budget airlines"
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Once again, KLM was cheaper than budget airlines on this date. Friendly crew, good selection of movies but once again tasteless food (just a wrap) given.

### "I was not able to board the flight"
Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. My friend and I have had an appalling experience with KLM. Due to an emergency, I was not able to board the flight on that day. In response to this, an employee at the KLM counter had helped us made another reservation on next day. However, when I had arrived at the KLM counter, the KLM employees told me that there were no seats available. Therefore, I have no choice but buy another ticket with other Airline. I worried KLM will cancel my flight for returning ticket. So I contacted  KLM, and they promised me that they will have a seat for me but I need to pay some penalty. However, KLM didn't achieve what they guaranteed. When I arrived KLM counter, they told me it was fully booked. I talked to Manager, she told me that what HQ promised to you is not our business.

### "cheaper than budget airlines"
Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Surprisingly, KLM was cheaper than budget airlines on this date. Despite the short distance flown, there was a hot meal (tasting awful), personal movie screens and 23 kg checked-in luggage allowance. The main complaint might be the boarding process. Zones made no sense, with 90% of passengers in Zone 5.

### "I would fly KLM again"
Stockholm to Amsterdam. Our flight was delayed due to a tyre requiring change. We had to disembark but the plane was ready for take off about 1.5 hours later. On flight meal is a sandwich plus one round of drinks for the 2 hour flight. The seats were comfortable for the 2 hour flight, staff were very friendly and professional. Despite the delay, I would fly KLM again.

### "impressed by the service"
Rome to Buenos Aires via Amsterdam. I was impressed by the service, quality of the aircraft, cleanliness and food. There was just an hour and 15 minutes transit time in Amsterdam but in fact due to a delay leaving from Rome the transit time was reduced to only 40 minutes. Despite this I made it to my flight and even my suitcase made it to Buenos Aires as normal which was a pleasant surprise.

### "seat itself is fairly comfortable"
Amsterdam to Beijing. Flew on KLM’s new Boeing 787-9, so the cabin overall is new and modern. The seat itself is fairly comfortable and legroom is average (I’m 175cm tall) however, KLM only provide a blanket on long haul flights, which do make trying to sleep harder. The amount of movies and shows available on the IFE is one of the best I’ve seen. While the range of shows is great, most only do have 1 episode. The huge selection and modern IFE is, unfortunately, undermined by the horrible audio quality. I’m not sure if this is true only for my seat, but there was a lot of background noise, meaning that I had to half-guess what the actors are saying (as there aren’t any English subtitles available either). Dinner was served with a choice of beef or chicken (I went for the chicken), which was a little bland in my opinion but the rest of the meal is fine. Overall, I enjoyed my flight, however, there's nothing about their service that would make me pay extra to fly with them, but it's definitely an airline to choose when the price is right.

### "Good flight with KLM"
Not Verified |  Tokyo to Amsterdam. Good flight with KLM. Always really good service and nice cabin crew. Crew speaks good English and on Japan flights they have Japanese speaking crew. Two good meals and in between I was mostly sleeping. Really quiet nice flight.

### "excellent service"
Amsterdam to Manchester. As ever, excellent service and flight with KLM. I also enjoyed the Crown Lounge 52 at Schipol, which was great. The flight was short and sweet, and very comfortable in seat 2F. As a new plane, it had in-seat USB charging too, which came in handy. Excellent food and drinks as well. Very happy customer!

### "dropped its standard considerably"
London City to Amsterdam. The check in was an hour. The flight delayed and seat at I'm sitting in has vomit on it and I was not offered an alternate seat. This is the worst flight I've been on. KLM has dropped its standard considerably. I will not use KLM now.

### "service was good"
Wroclaw to Amsterdam. It was a bit delayed leaving but arrived on time. Everything was okay but the snacks were very small. The service was good and all the processes were smooth and I really like the colour of the aircraft.

### "service was lovely"
Manchester to Amsterdam. I was originally booked onto another flight with Flybe however due to technical problems, the flight was downgraded and I was booked onto another flight. As I had arrived really early, I was booked onto the 5:55am flight with KLM. The service was lovely, the flight attendants were very nice and cheerful even at 6am. The pilot let us know what was happening and informed us due to a favourable tailwind, it was likely we would arrive at Amsterdam early. I also assumed because it was a short flight that no refreshments would be provided which was not the case.

### "Very comfortable trip"
Early morning flight Manchester to Amsterdam. I was sitting in seat 2F in Business Class. Flight departed nearly half an hour late due to the weather in Amsterdam, but we arrived ahead of schedule. Very comfortable trip and service from the cabin crew was superb. They served a delicious breakfast, which I enjoyed. I cannot recommend KLM highly enough.

### "Service was ok"
Amsterdam to Stockholm with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. After being delayed for nearly an hour on board, we finally took off to a smooth flight. No entertainment on board the 2 hour flight. Our snack was a small slice of cake, water and a selection of drinks, although alcoholic beverages were also available. Service was ok. We didn’t test it out much on the 2 hour flight. Seats are ok. Leg space is narrow. I noted Business Class looks exactly the same except they sit right in front - looks completely pointless to fly business.

### "great service from the KLM staff"
When we arrived at the airport and through security check, we received a message that our flight from Amsterdam to Shanghai was cancelled. (From Amsterdam to Shanghai with KLM, from Shanghai to Bali with China Eastern) This message came 2 hours before scheduled departure (21:30). Reason: technical problem with the Dreamliner. We went directly to the transfer desk, where they could inform us they rebooked our flight to the next day at 14:30 via Dubai - very dissappointed. Because we knew there was a direct flight to Denpasar (Bali) departing at 21:00, we were offered to go to the ticketing and service desk. At this desk they luckily rescheduled our flight to the direct one to Bali. So we arrived 5 hours earlier than expected, because we now flew via Singapore instead of Shanghai. Unfortunately, our gluten free meal could not be rescheduled. Very great service from the KLM staff, besides the meals.

### "attendants were so kind"
❎ Not Verified | New York to Amsterdam. The flight attendants were so kind to me and my wife. We are celebrating our 25th anniversary and they surprised us with a nice token to celebrate. We sat towards the end of the plane but we will never forget the crew who treated us wonderfully. We did not get their names but two of them stood out.

### "never received any compensation"
Not Verified |  We had a 16-hours-delay in Amsterdam due to a much too late connecting KLM flight. No assistance given at AMS airport, so we booked a hotel at our costs and took flight KL 1395 instead. After our holidays we made a claim with KLM: first they wrote us compensation would be 250 EUR which is wrong. We protested. Then KLM sent us a mail that the compensation would be 600 EUR which KLM overruled by themselves by stating the compensation was 450 EUR. We gave them all bank details 3 weeks ago but never received any compensation. This airline is a shame. Avoid in all circumstances.

### "bad low-cost approach"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Turin. Always delayed. Since three years I’m regularly flying with KLM on the same route and every time the delays are getting worse. On average 45-minute delay is standard. But it can easily reach the 2:50 (notice, never 3 to ask for a refund). Another important aspect is also the ticket price which raised from about 120EUR to about 200EUR on the same route, but the ticket the same period in advance. Very bad “low-cost" approach in a nice package or without anything or with the luggage and space seat for 100EUR more per person.

### "Waste of time and money"
Berlin to Amsterdam with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. I'm not happy with their service. Not only did they cancel the flight, they delayed it, never offered a refund or compensation but a cheap voucher and an option to choose the next flight. When I checked in my baggage, they forced me to check in my hand carry on luggage saying that there weren't enough spaces. I had a big laptop and a camera inside, how am I supposed to carry it all without a proper bag? So I said I needed an insurance policy if my electronics are destroyed I need compensation, and your staff gave me a sour face. Seriously, stay away from this flight! Waste of time and money.

### "thoroughly impressed"
Amsterdam to Frankfurt. First time flying KLM and thoroughly impressed! The flight was delayed for 10 minutes but the cabin crew and the pilots were exceptional. They carry a genuine smile whenever they interact with passengers, something that is hardly seen. Upon deplaning, the pilot stood at the door and said good-bye to passengers, even helping carry one of the strollers down to the bus. Food (egg salad tortilla wraps + water) was very decent for a 45-minute flight. I am a frequent flyer with Star Alliance but would fly again with KLM any day.

### "never fly again with this airline"
Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. It was an unpleasant experienced. I was given the seat no 35G in the middle row. At first, I figured out a big trash inside of my seat pocket in front of me. After about half an hour when the steward hand out wet tissues to the passengers, I asked the steward politely to help me with the trash. He refused by saying "No" and I understood from his face he might think that the trash is belong to me. To make it worse I asked the second officer which is stewardess to help me up with the trash and she said that she will get back to me for a few minutes as she was busy delivering snacks. But nothing has changed until me myself throw it away when the flight are about to landed. I  will never fly again with this airline.

### "this airline truly does not care"
Manchester to Amsterdam. Left me a voicemail 12 hours before I was due to fly (parking booked, business meeting arranged for 2 months, bags packed etc) telling me they'd overbooked and I was no longer on the flight. Instead I was flying to Brussels, then on to Amsterdam and arriving 6 hours after my scheduled meeting. After 2 hours of pleading, they still couldn't care less. Basically spoke to a human robot for 2 hours. Ended up getting 2 hours sleep, going to Aberdeen first then Amsterdam, and still missed my meeting due to a delay and then having to wait 40 mins for my bag which was hand luggage that they insisted on putting in the hold. All they have to say is they were within their rights to do so. Ignoring the lack of morals involved and stress it caused me. I wasn't interested in their measly offer of compensation, I just wanted my original flight. To do this to people - which I believe they do regularly - at such short notice is immoral and wrong. Sent a complaint afterwards and today - 8 days later - no response. When I rang for an update, I got another of their human robots who just repeated they were within their rights to do it. The stress this caused me at the time, as well as forcing me to take a different flight which left me with virtually no sleep, is not patched up by some lowball monetary offer. Their lack of understanding compounds that this airline truly does not care.

### "been a terrible experience"
Amsterdam to Hamburg. Avoid if at all possible. The flight cabin, food and flight crew are of an acceptable quality but the logistics are terrible. The website and app are really difficult to use. The luggage was lost for the whole plane load of passengers. Imagine how poor the procedures are if you can lose not one but a plane load of luggage. The subsequent experience of trying to get it back beggars belief. Three days later, still no bag, no apology and no money to buy new clothes. They don’t read and respond to complaints, just give a standard message noting they received your complaint. This has been a terrible experience of an airline that doesn’t have its act together and does not care about its passengers.

### "Stay away from KLM"
Frankfurt to Saint Petersburg via Amsterdam. KL flight 1770 departure FRA postponed from 17.50 to 18.40 h. Finally departed 20.50. No reason given by KLM, no excuse, nothing. Arrived AMS 21.55. Had time if not so much delayed to reach KL flight 1399 to Saint Petersburg at 20.55. Missed connecting flight. No support at AMS airport. Booked hotel for the night at our own costs. Got rebooked flight on next day 13.00. Missed 1 complete day of our holidays. Had to pay prebooked 5-star-hotel at Petersburg without using it. Filled a form for compensation under EU legislation. KLM refused, 'you have to fill in some other forms'. Filled in some other forms with bank account. KLM wrote back they hadn't got our bank account. Filled in some more forms. KLM told then compensation would be 600 EUR for each of us. 1 hour later came another mail we are sorry compensation is only 250 EUR per person. We answered both 250 EUR and 600 EUR were wrong because these were flights far above 1.500 km, both flights starting in EU, KLM seated in EU and the delay was 15 hours. So compensation must be 400 EUR each one. Finally sent them the text of EU rules. Never got any reply. Stay away from KLM.

### "the perfect, cheap choice"
Aberdeen to Prague via Amsterdam. I personally feel safer, more welcome and more comfortable on a KLM flight than I do flying with anyone else. KLM is the perfect, cheap choice for a safe and enjoyable journey.

### "a very good flight experience"
Toronto to Amsterdam. I had not flown with KLM for a number of years so was interested to fly them again. It was a full flight to Amsterdam, the flight crew were very attentive and professional. Service before, during and after the meal was excellent. The cabin was warm so no need for the blanket on this flight and managed a few hours sleep, the pillow was great. All in all a very good flight experience on the way over to Amsterdam and also on the flight back 4 days later. Well done to all of the KLM crew and staff.

### "cabin crew was very pleasant"
Amsterdam to Aruba. Booked a flight to Aruba for a short week with KLM for a price what I've found quite steep for such a flight, though I was not in the mood to use Arkefly. On the day of travel, the public transport was striking forcing me to go to Amsterdam early to prevent being late to my flight. Flight itself boarded on time and departed about 25 minutes late as ground staff was late bringing a passenger on board who needed assistance. Eventually airborne, a round of drinks were served about 30 minutes after airborne. About an hour later, food was served and I chose for Chicken in BBQ sauce which was ok in size and quality, though a tad sweet. About midway through a flight, the only round of drinks (water only) and icecream was served. Another meal service was initiated about 90 minutes to landing which was ok (sort of Pizza slice) and some dessert and salad. Enjoyable. The flight itself was decent and cabin crew was very pleasant, though KLM could have offered a better service by providing us with more drinks instead of continuously asking for a drink.

### "KLM offers a very good product"
Vienna to Sao Paulo via Amsterdam. The new lounge at Schiphol is excellent with plenty of space to choose from and drink and food options are plenty, fresh and the area is well kept by smiling and helpful staff. Boarding was well organised with priorities well taken care of. After boarding cabin crew make you feel comfortable. Pre departure drinks were offered and the flight attendant offered to prepare my favourite cocktail. Menus, very nice amenity kits and warm towels distributed. After take-off, more drinks and warm salted almonds were served. In flight entertainment options are varied. A delicious lunch followed with two choices of appetisers, three choises of main dishes, dessert and cheese. A mid flight snack was seved and yet a light meal before landing completed a no non sense catering experience. Quantity and quality were both outstanding and presented by attentive cabin crew. One point that deserves KLM attention is their long haul product is the seat, while on short haul it offers a good seat pitch and recline, their long haul product needs an update urgently. The seat is too narrow limiting the choice of a good sleeping position even though it stretches to a full horizontal position, space for the feet is minimal and if you need to go to the toilet, you will have to jump over your neighbours legs, most airlines are now offering seats in a staggering position to avoid this. Alll in all KLM offers a very good product and special kudos to their great staff.

### "onboard service was good"
This was the last flight of the day from Amsterdam to Manchester. It departed significantly later than scheduled, which was quite frustrating. However, the onboard service was good, as ever, and a snack and drinks were provided.

### "seats were cheap looking"
Seoul to Basel via Amsterdam. Service was the best out of 3 airlines I have recently flown. The seats were cheap looking and very old. The aircraft was very old, chipped bathroom etc. The food was okay but tasted a little a bit of plastic from the melted base or the lid. Overall it was an okay meal. In-flight entertainment was satisfactory and this flight didn't have WiFi.

### "Manchester to Amsterdam"
This was the early morning flight from Manchester to Amsterdam, which I have flown several times before. This flight was punctual, and we arrived on time. Onboard service was excellent, with a breakfast sandwich and hot and cold drinks provided. I recommend KLM for short haul and long haul flights. They've never let me down.

### "good luck, you will need it"
KL 1073 Amsterdam to Manchester flight. Arrived at Schiphol Airport 3.5 hours before the 1 hour 15 mins flight to Manchester. Upon arrival at Manchester half the passengers received their luggage and half did not! No excuses can rectify that happening. We had to fill out paperwork and then leave for our hotel with nothing and hope our luggage would be delivered. It was delivered a day and a half later, in the evening. Upon inquiring at the airport and from the baggage company employees handling this issue for KLM, I found out that this is a regular occurrence each day and not a one off. Apparently they leave your luggage behind in order to ship cargo to Manchester as it is a big money earner for them. They inconvenience the paying customer and spoil their vacation. Luckily we were at a hotel for 4 days but if you are renting a car and moving around Britain - good luck, you will need it. I suggest check out other airlines rather than have this happen to you. We will never fly KLM again!

### "never book a flight with KLM again"
Not Verified |  Leeds to Bremen via Amsterdam. Flew in May but my baggage turned up 4 days later, bought £30 worth of toiletries but no clothes as I’m staying in offshore. Was promised £30 back and £100 compensation. Haven’t received anything but emails telling me my bank details are incorrect. Not the first time it has happened. But certainly the last as I will never book a flight with KLM again

### "Smooth morning flight"
Smooth morning flight from Zurich to Amsterdam. Full plane but nevertheless very fast boarding. Exit row seat 11D. Exceptional large legroom. Catering consisted out of a cake, can of water and an additional drink. Only minus was the far away landing runway, so we had to taxi 12 minutes after landing to the terminal.

### "Excellent experience"
Excellent experience, staff are first class, food and entertainment very high standard, easy of travel and ground support excellent, 5 stars all round, seat very comfortable with loads of space, highly recommend.

### "the worst day of my life"
Milan to Amsterdam. KLM just made the worst day of my life! The whole operation and customer service is a joke. They oversold their tickets and put me on the waiting list twice for both of my return flights in the same week. I checked in online early, selected seats, and even traveling with my boyfriend who got a seat. And the customer service just let me down again the staff don’t give a damn and not Helpful at all and won’t even give any apologies!

### "seats were quite comfortable"
Paris to Amsterdam on a new 737-800. Boarding was done quickly and the flight was quite full. We had seats 26E and F, which are behind the wing. The interior was equipped with new slimline seats with USB-ports and a adjustable headrest, and the seats were quite comfortable. The legroom was also okay for this short flight. After the on time take-off the cabin crew started to distribute water and cake, and coffee and tea. The crew was quite in a hurry because the flight lasted only for 45-50 minutes, but they managed to serve everyone. Overall, my experience with KLM was very good; good seats, efficient and professional crew with a nice Dutch touch.

### "Never again"
Xiamen to Luxembourg via Amsterdam. Customer service hotline not helpful / efficient in context of ticket rebooking, contacting airline and not any form of willingness to help. Even for 15 hours flight rarely drinks, snacks or good food. If you want water or drink or snack you must go to front on own initiative and staff allow you to take something - general harshness, unflexibility and not sincere treatment of passengers - when asking to get luggage during 14 hours stay or cancelling a last flight and getting luggage earlier, they are worried about money and ask you to pay 300€ if you want your luggage. If you pay 3 flights but want to take only 2 flights they insist to send luggage to last destination or pay 300€. Never again.

### "cant give us good seats"
Amsterdam to Singapore. I had heard from colleagues that airlines give you good treatment if you book them for your honeymoon. With this expectation I contacted the crew and informed them of it, they acted cute and nice at first. Later a lady bluntly asks us for our passports and informs us how they cant give us good seats. What dissapointment I feel.

### "Would not recommend"
Not Verified |  Luxembourg to Oslo via Amsterdam. Early morning flight from Luxembourg to Oslo via Amsterdam. Shortly before boarding they announce there is a technical problem. About 45 minutes later I call KLM for advice whether to rebook immediately for fear of missing the connection in Amsterdam. Person on the other end is of no help and barely understands my question. About 90 minutes after we were supposed to board, flight is cancelled and we are advised to go to counters for rebooking. While waiting in line I discover an e-mail from KLM saying they've rebooked us to an evening flight, which means delay in arrival of about 12 hours, midnight instead of noon. At the counter we are informed there are no available earlier flights and we get zero information about EU directive for compensation in case of delay, just a useless peace of paper saying they're sorry and how I can contact customer service on Twitter. We get vouchers for 10 EUR of airport food and that's it. On the evening flight there are problems as the airport system says the flight is closed and we cannot go to security, takes about 20 minutes to clear that up. Flight to Amsterdam goes smoothly and we arrive practically on the gate for the connection. Flight Amsterdam to Oslo is delayed about 15 minutes. On the way back, Oslo-Amsterdam goes well. Amsterdam to Luxembourg, they put us in the plane and announce there is a delay due to strike of Belgian air control, will take about 20 minutes, ends up taking 35, and then they discover a technical problem and call maintenance. Another good 20 minutes until they reset something, and we are good to go. Which means another 10-15 minutes plus long taxi. During lift-off, drops of water fall on my husband sitting next to the window, most likely condensate due to poor isolation on the cabin roof. Also once during the flight. First time flying KLM, two delays in a week, and one of those significant. We planned a day and a half in Oslo and this delay significantly influenced our schedule, not to mention we were horribly tired after waking up at 4 to catch the first flight and then waiting an entire day for the next one. The only reason they are getting 4/10 is that the customer service answered my e-mail quickly and said we were eligible for compensation according to the EU directive. However, had I not known my rights, KLM certainly would not have informed me of them. Would not recommend and will not fly again.

### "very pleased with staff"
Delhi to Amsterdam. I am very pleased with staff and services of KLM. My economy seating was upgraded to Business with miles. Staff at Delhi airport was kind and professional. Lounge staff, airline staff was courteous and polite. I thank airline and their staff for outstanding service.

### "done with KLM and Delta"
This International Delta flight was operated by KLM on the return way. I missed my connection due to delay in Berlin at take off and was off-put by the just okay behaviour of the crew. Messy on boarding, very light apologies when we started to face heavy delays, scarce information, except at the very end. At  Schiphol airport, the experience shifted from average to bad. My flight got rescheduled though Atlanta, not what I wanted, with no means to change. Pretty rude, snarky people and I got a 5-euro voucher compensation for snacks. I got to the new lounge. Icy reception from the lady at the entrance. At that point, I had reached a point of frustration where I wouldn't want to go through the KLM website. I tried as an experimental thing is there a way I could ask to talk to one of these human beings, and just share my experience (and name and ticket) via an actual conversation, so that it would end up being logged somewhere? TI had to press a button "Other requests" and find out that I was #3 in the queue before someone would talk to me. But since there was no actual way for anyone to identify me I  finally approached someone. Quietly and politely. She acted quite professionally but said she could do nothing for me unless "I would go on line and fill a form". Wonders of rationalism. I am done with KLM and Delta. I booked my next flight via Lufthansa.

### "Shocking customer service"
Manchester to Delhi via Amsterdam. The poor relation in business class travel. Shocking customer service when our flight was delayed all other connecting flights overbooked - re-routed us to another airport - had to arrange our own taxi to drive over 300 miles - we had a 10 hour delay and will find a loop hole to avoid any compensation - blaming re-routing air traffic out of their control. Much better airlines who care and follow up professional. Wouldn't fly again BC or indeed recommend.

### "hot and stuffy during boarding"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Oslo. Flight KL1147 was delayed by 1 hour. The first reason given was “late arrival of incoming aircraft”. The second reason was “strike in France”. The third and later excuse from the flight deck was “new system of air traffic control”. I had preciously noted that this week this flight had been delayed regularly. Inside the cabin it was extremely hot and stuffy during boarding. It was a fairly new plane and the purser had to be told by a cabin crew how to shut the overhead lockers. Apart from this it was a good flight.

### "They overbook flights"
Amsterdam to London. Never fly KLM. They overbook flights leaving your journey stressful and unplannable. Was not communicated to me at all why I couldn’t check in my flight remotely online when I got the hint and then going to airport I wasn’t given a seat.

### "never fly with KLM again"
Berlin to Amsterdam. I will certainly never fly with KLM again. The flight wasn’t a nightmare but it was definitely one of the worse ones I’ve been on. While it was severely delayed that is not why I am rating it so low. My issue with the flight lies mainly in the impolite attitude of the stewardesses and the horrendous food. Flying in business class I expected the food and service to be at least somewhat decent but was thoroughly disappointed. Not only were the stewardesses impolite but also almost shouting to each other, which got rather annoying after a short while. The business class passengers were only offered a small cup of tea once during the entire flight, as far as beverages are concerned. The food was also worse than most economy class meals I have eaten in my life.

### "Pleasant, nice staff"
Gdansk to Split via Amsterdam. A nice KLM journey, all in scheduled time, without problems, like for budget flight on a short distance, good service. Pleasant, nice staff. I have made several KLM flights a week, still the same sandwich is tiring, however it was not a big problem.

### "never will fly KLM again"
Helsinki to Amsterdam. My first experience with KLM was about 2 years ago ( AMS-Malaga & return ) and it was horrible. On May 1 I was re-booked by Finnair to fly with KLM due to a delayed flight from BKK. On board food was tasteless plus a horrible service provided. Had 1 hr 40 minutes lay over in HEL which I thought more than enough time to transfer my luggage from Finnair to KLM aircraft but it did not. Claim missing luggage report made at KLM arrival service desk at Schiphol, they sent me to Swissport office at arrival to make my report despite flying in their KLM aircraft. Was very nice of Swissport staff escorted me back to KLM desk and explained to them that it is their responsibility for this loss but they refused at first. To sum up, if it were not a re-booked flight, i would never get to experience KLM and never will fly KLM again.

### "decade behind competition"
Montreal to Amsterdam. Horrible business class seat. This aircraft was in the old business class cabin configuration, and I must say that I never would have thought of a frontline European airline being able to offer such dysmal seats and amenities. I have seen these seats previously over 10 years ago in some other airlines in old planes like MD-11, but nowhere else in 2018. Not a lie flat, but angled seat with a tiny pivoting TV screen. Very difficult to sleep in! I understand KLM is about to (or has already) replaced now the seats but still in late 2018 this was incomprehensible how they even dared to offer such service in business class - a decade behind competition.

### "I was well cared for"
My partner and I were travelling from Rome to Edinburgh via Amsterdam on 7/5/2019. Unfortunately, the flight from Rome was delayed due to factors outside of KLM's control, and we missed our connection. The KLM team were very professional and helpful. They apologised to us in person on the flight and advised us that we would be put up in a hotel overnight and rebooked onto a flight the next morning (there were no flights to Schiphol that night after our missed connection). The staff on the flight gave us instructions on how to use the appropriate self service terminals within Schiphol to obtain our vouchers for accommodation, transport and food overnight. Through the terminal at Schiphol, we were easily able to check in for our flight the next morning (already rebooked for us), select our seats, and print vouchers for a hotel stay, airport food and a shuttle bus to and from the hotel. The vouchers for food worked at the terminal and transport to the Ibis hotel was efficient and straightforward. On arrival at the hotel, there was a special check in desk for delayed KLM customers and we were served promptly and professionally, with a timetable provided for the shuttle bus the next day. Our room was pleasant and transport to the airport the next day was once again straightforward. The hotel stay even included dinner and breakfast, though we did not partake. This was my first time flying with KLM, and I am pleased to say that I was well cared for, especially when we were delayed. The cabin crew were lovely and did their best in a difficult situation. The logistics of the rebooking and overnight stay were impressively handled. I would not hesitate to fly with KLM again.

### "a below par performance"
I am a fairly regular and satisfied user of KLM in Business Class, albeit normally long haul. On this occasion it was a relatively short flight from Amsterdam to Malaga with my family. Check in was speedy but no notification was given that there was an aircraft type and configuration change (already known at check-in by the way). Consequently it came as a surprise when we boarded to find that some of us had been re-assigned. One could argue that we should have checked our seat assignments at check in. My excuse is that I have never experienced an unannounced seat re-allocation in all the 20 years or so I have travelled with KLM. Advance warning of the fact would have been welcomed. Lounge was adequate. Boarding procedure reasonably adequate. Comfort factor in Business Class was no more than one can expect on European flights these days! Cabin crew friendly but lacked concentration. In a cabin of 11 passengers the Purser somehow managed to forget to serve both my wife's and my meal. These things can happen, although one can question why in such a small cabin. If we were not regulars on KLM it could have left a very poor impression of the airline to a newcomer. All in all I think it is fair to conclude that on this occasion it was a below par performance for the fare paid.

### "Will never fly KLM again"
Bristol to Prague via Amsterdam. My flight was delayed from Bristol, so missed our connecting flight, spent 8 hours in Schiphol, then flew to Prague alone and spent the night and next day on my own while the rest of my party stayed together, got a nice hotel and €250 compensation. Apparently I wasn’t eligible for compensation. Rude staff. Worst airline I’ve ever flown on. Will never fly KLM again.

### "customer service of KLM kept silent"
Bangkok to Amsterdam. Some delay, chaotic incheck and rude staff. Lack of meals onboard especially when you sit in the back of the airplane. No extra services (like in the past). Only sorry or arrogant behaviour. Seats that malfunctioned during the flight. Staff didn't stop her but encouraged her. Gave her a VIP treatment and me the cold shoulder. Also the only language they were willing to speak was English. So far customer service of KLM kept silent although they stated that within 10 working days there's answer.

### "Unwilling to do anything"
I flew to Venice to enjoy a week of paragliding with some friends. When I booked the ticket, I had to pay extra for checked baggage (standard for most airlines) but KLM decided not to load the baggage onto the aircraft. This looks like a new little trick to make extra cash. Overbooking the bagage and then send it via the next flight. While we were waiting to board the aircraft, I actually saw my luggage being handled by bagage handlers, it was at the aircraft. KLM did not load my baggage, it was not by error or mistake, but by decision. Obviously I was very surprised that my baggage were "delayed". It took me 2 hours at the the lost baggage counter to complete the lost baggage claim form. I was traveling with two other persons, so they also had to wait. I'm not going to go into detail, but you can imagine the repercussion of this. The next day was Easter Sunday, not a single shop was open. I went to Italy to paraglide, but that's not an option if you don't have your paraglider. So in an instant my holiday was ruined. A financial loss that does not get covered by the airline or insurance. The complete lack of empathy of the customer service is amazing. Unwilling to do anything other than telling me I have to wait. Lying to me that the bagage will be delivered within 24 hours while they were fully aware it was a public holiday and nothing will be done. I offered to fetch the baggage myself at the airport, but that was too much trouble for the customer service employee to get that organised. So she just lied to me and said that it was not possible and the baggage is probably already on its way. It arrived 2 days later. I decided to file a complaint, hopeful that I could get a reason why my bagage was not loaded onto the aircraft. This is the most disgusting service I ever experienced. Basically they copy paste text from your complaint and add "We are sorry for" or even better "I am concerned to read about" in front of it. I had to ask the person to reread my complaint as their response made no sense. They offered me a 100 euro voucher which I turned down, what an insult. I don't measure how well a business runs, I measure them how they resolve a problem. The only response so far were "We are sorry for your inconvenience

### "I would fly with them again"
The staff were very friendly on the planes. The KLM app was a lifesaver and had all the information we needed so would definitely recommend people downloading this app when flying. On our way there the plane took off 40 minutes from the time it was suppose to and on the way back it took off 45 minutes from when it was suppose to, there wasn’t too much difference in the time we landed as it was only about 10-20 minutes difference but this was slightly inconvenient due to our transfers and pick ups waiting. On the flight home the airline overbooked and were trying to get people to get on another flight, they also started saying they wanted to check in carry on luggage and one man working for KLM lied and said that we were all only suppose to have one carry on and not another small bag- just an item like a purse or an umbrella, not a backpack, I looked this up immediately after and could see clearly on the website that it stated we were allowed a carry on luggage bag to go in the top and another small bag (40cm etc) that can fit under the seat in front of you which means he definitely only said it because they over booked and wanted peoples hand luggage checked in which was a bit sly. Overall all though it got us to where we needed to be safely, the staff were very nice, the snacks on the plane were tasty and it was good. I would fly with them again!

### "very pleasant flight"
Smooth ground service, attentive, smiling and capable cabin crew. You do not encounter complimentary wine in many short haul flights, their Sauvignon/Chardonnay accompanied this flight very well. Wraps were served. No complaints at all. A very pleasant flight.

### "appalled by customer service"
London to Rio de Janeiro  via Amsterdam. I am so appalled by the customer service of this company. I travelled with them twice in 2 years and both times they delayed my luggage. After an 11 hour flight I was told that I would be missing my luggage for 2 days (and both were 6 day trips). What was more annoying was that on my 14 hour journey to Rio I was not allowed any check in pieces so I packed everything for hand carry. I was then told I had to check it in. I got an email when I landed to say only my husbands luggage was delayed, which meant I wasted time at the carousel waiting for mine. When I checked with the counter mine was also delayed. They promised to deliver in the next day but it actually came almost 48 hours later. I expected a decent compensation since this happened the second time but they didn’t even offer a discount voucher or money to make up for it. They have ruined my holiday twice now and I will never be flying with them again. I tried calling them and speaking to them several times but it was a nightmare.

### "never again fly with KLM"
Southampton to Amsterdam. This company should not be operating. They issued the wrong ticket, misleading me in my luggage allowance and then never followed it up to say it was wrong, followed by a suspension of service, moving our flight to a different company who’s luggage policy is completely different to theirs meaning a smaller amount of kilograms without ever informing me. When I dealt with their customer service, they refused to put a manager on the phone and were absolutely appalling saying my options are to get a full refund ( meaning I would lose all my hotel booking money for the holiday) or just buy extra luggage allowance from the new company without any contribution towards it. I will never again fly with KLM and will never recommend to anyone. They caused a lot of upset days before a lovely holiday!

### "smooth ground service"
Amsterdam to Berlin. As a foreigner who lives in Amsterdam, KLM eventually became one of my favorite airlines. But their 737-700's are pretty worn and outdated that all beg for renovation or retirement. Upgrading to Economy Comfort usually helps, in terms of better seat pitch, however for short-haul flights like AMS-TXL this is not a deal breaker anyway. I was a bit disappointed by their single-bite sandwich this time, but a full board drinks selection was alright, smiling faces of cabin crew and smooth ground service. You can not break many points when you see such a great crew each time.

### "good crew and hospitality"
Amsterdam to Helsinki. Very good crew and hospitality. Tasty foods and cakes. Smiling and happy crew. On time performance. I wish i have more food or on time purchasable foods.

### "Staff were so obnoxious"
Johannesburg to Manchester via Amsterdam. Poor service at check-in desk in Johannesburg, I  checked in 2 hours before boarding time. I was told by the staff they are waiting for seat, when I asked how long they didn't know. After waiting for 30 minute  asked what was going on and was told the flight was over booked, had no seat I will have  to fly the following day. Staff were so obnoxious no apologies nothing, then i was told i should have checked in online thats why i had no seat. I insisted on speaking to manager in charge she was also of no help. Cabin staff took their time to answer call.

### "Service totally absent"
Paris CDG to Amsterdam with KLM. Average service for the Class. Some delay at CDG. Priority passengers must do their own check in. The airline lost my baggage. It has been 4 days and have not been contacted by the airline. Service totally absent.

### "Great customer service"
Edinburgh to Amsterdam via Helsinki. Great customer service on board, food is good enough. Had some trouble catching my connecting flight on my way to Edinburgh (which was mostly on me to be honest, but plane arriving a bit late was a part of it), but absolutely no trouble on my way back home. Every flight attendant was very nice and considerate, and kept on a smile for the customers, even when busy.

### "half an hour late departing"
I got from Oslo to Amsterdam without incident. The catering was OK. However, the flight which was operated by Stobart was half an hour late departing. The crew spoke english with a strong Irish accent which was difficult to understand. The KLM booking site needs improving and the “ welcome home” email did not work.

### "will never fly with them again"
Beijing to Newcastle via Amsterdam. The actual flight was ok. Nothing special. But the worst part of this whole ordeal was the way they handled things behind the scenes. On my way to Newcastle they lost my bag. Ok no problem. Mistakes can happen. I get my claim reference number and then get a text the next day that my bag will be arriving. I go check for the bag they said they left at reception and it is the wrong bag. In my description of the bag I said that it is a hard shell gray suitcase. The bag that showed up was a soft black bag. I call KLM letting them know that the wrong bag showed up and they tell me that I have to bring the bag back to the airport. I tell them no because it was their mistake and why should I go out of my way on my 13 day vacation to fix their mistake. They apologized and said they would send someone over to pick it up. In my 13 days in Newcastle I probably called them over 27 times. Each time being told that they are still looking for the bag. I come back home after my trip to Korea and keep calling. Finally one component employee let's me know that they have actually put the search for my bag on hold because I hadn't returned the wrong bag. Mind you, this is over 2 months now and no one has ever mentioned this to me in my previous calls after the first call I gave them when they delivered the wrong bag. I told them that I have told a KLM representative to pick up the bag and they said that they would. They apologized and sent someone over and then a few days later my bag arrived. I have never been so stressed about travelling until this. I wasn't unhappy about them losing my bag, but was extremely frustrated with the KLM handled the whole situation. Each time I called, it seemed that the employee was more confused about my situation. My phone calls consisted of me asking them to open my case for the search which they said they would request their supervisor, but my case was only opened 2 months later. Each employee guaranteed the case would be opened, but it was all a lie. Communication is not a quality the company has within their team. My friend has also flown with them recently to visit me in which both of her flights got cancelled. No notification was given about these cancellations until the actual day of the flight and they also lost her bag on her way back home. I couldn't believe it when I heard that this happened. I will never fly with them again.

### "Excellent customer service"
Excellent customer service desk of KLM! We needed to reschedule some tickets, due to the problems with Jet Airways. When you call their customer service center, they picked up the phone in 1 minute - - they know already based on my  phone who I am - for whom I  booked - the problem and - within 2 minutes they solved the problem and before I  hang up I had new tickets in my mailbox. Needed them three times in the last week. Three times really excellent service. Costs a bit more, but worthwhile.

### "Will not fly with KLM anymore"
Amsterdam to Montreal. I had a bad experience during my last trip. I was supposed to initially board on an AtlasGlobal plane from Istanbul to Amsterdam, and then after 2 hours of layover get on the KLM plane towards Montreal. Original plane takeoff time in Istanbul was scheduled at 10:40 AM , but the boarding did not start till 10:50 AM without even updating the billboard notifications. After everyone got boarded on the plane it took a long time for it to be allowed to take off (about 2 hours delay). Therefore, when we got to Amsterdam Schiphol airport we had only 20 minutes to pass security and run for the KLM flight. So had to run from 1 end of airport to the other (including running down the stairs). The plane was already boarded and we barely made it. After the plane landed on Montreal and got internet, we saw a notification on KLM mobile app that the baggage did not make it in time to the airplane. After going through a lot of forms and extra wait and stress we were able to file a delivery request for our baggage as we live in Ottawa which is 2 hours driving distance from Montreal The next day, after a long unhappy flight experience, we got another notification mentioning that our baggage is still on its way, and we should go to KL baggage service desk at "the airport". I wish this was a bad joke but it is not. Is it really ok to send such confusing and uncanny notifications? I don't think so! Will not fly with KLM anymore and suggest you do not either.

### "no menu for Business class"
Singapore to Denpasar. I am a platinum member on Finnair and I have never encountered such awful service on an airline. I flew KLM a few times in the past (even this same route), and it was actually pretty good. I know this flight was different when the stewardess told me ‘We don’t do that in this route’. What they don’t do for this 2.5 hour flight, no blankets, no menu for Business class, no chocolate desert for business class, limited choices for food on business class (we were given one choice). It took them 20 mins to get me a cup of tea, and no choices of the tea bag. I could hear the flight attendants laughing  and chatting in the galley. If KLM don’t intend to serve business class on this route don’t sell it as business class! Seats were OK, comfortable but lacking storage space and privacy. Entertainment system was very good and selection was amazing.

### "Next time another airline"
San Jose to Amsterdam. Quality of the catering in the business class could not be worse. The dinner was served about 45 minutes after take-off, the whole dinner at the same time. There was nothing to choose. The food served was not suitable for me. Soup was not warm. The dessert was about the cheapest stuff, a very small vanilla pudding. Next time another airline.

### "steady decline in quality"
Not Verified |  Birmingham to Sao Paulo via Amsterdam. I've been flying with KLM for about 10 years and have seen the steady decline in the quality of service. Last trip booked reminded me to leave KLM as a last resort from now on. Booked flights for me and my wife to Brazil. We chose the option with no checked luggage as we're only going for a week. Then I added one piece on top of tickets, for £60. All seemed fine, until they tell you after payment that the £60 was only for the return flight! Fair enough, so I ask to add one on the way out, and surprisingly I can't because it's a FlyBE / AirFrance flight. What kind of airline sells tickets for it's partner airlines but not luggage allowance? Thanks to that 'clever' service, we're bound to whatever they'll charge us at the airport. Next time, Lufthansa it is.

### "Overall really nice"
I used KLM from Düsseldorf to Osaka via Amsterdam and on the return flight as well, it was my first time using this airline and i can only recommend it! The planes were punctual, the cabin crew very friendly, the food was ok (for plane food) and i had enough leg space. They have less shows to watch compared to Lufthansa (they have complete seasons instead of random episodes like KLM) but that didn't bother me that much. Overall really nice and i would definitely use it again.

### "no customer service whatsoever"
Dublin to Milan. I was extremely disappointed with my trip. The ground people were very nice, but the other staff or management I needed help from were extremely non-flexible, did not listen, and had no customer service whatsoever. This ruined my experience so much that I have to give a 1-star rating. I have never experienced something like this in my life. I will never fly with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines again. I was shocked by such a lack of customer service.

### "A fantastic airline"
Newcastle to Amsterdam. A fantastic airline. Both flights on time, excellent food and beverage service despite only a 1 hour flight time and the most friendly and attentive cabin crew I've had looking after me in 100+ flights. A perfect service. I am taking a longer flight with this KLM next month from Newcastle to Miami via Amsterdam and Atlanta and it's something I'm really looking forward to. A quick word about that; We only had a 1hr 25m layover in Amsterdam which leaves little margin for error and could become a stressful situation with a young child especially as we were flying in on a smaller plane which parks up away from the terminal and requires a shuttle bus to the airport. I called KLM customer service and despite me not having a flexible ticket they have kindly allowed us to travel on an earlier flight meaning that we can now relax safe in the knowledge that we will definitely make our connection to Atlanta. Great customer service.

### "no help was provided"
I was travelling with my wife and daughter 3 year old from Birmingham to Alicante via Amsterdam. The flight from BHX was late by more than 2 hours. And I was stranded at the airport with my 3 year old without any help. I called the customer care three times; the first two representatives were very rude but got no answer even after 30 min. The ground staff was horrible. They appeared at the gate only after 1 hr and were very unprofessional. The airline could have asked the ground staff to distribute some water bottles to the passengers at least. When I reached at Amsterdam airport, I have to run to the gate with my daughter in the lap for almost 20 minutes because the connection time was less 10 min. Again no help was provided by the ground staff. I was exhausted my back continued to ache for the next 2 days, our daughter was exhausted and my wife was tired. Our first 2 days of holiday in Spain was a complete waste. Also, our baggage was not on the same flight and got it delivered next day at 5 p.m..

### "lovely couple of flights"
Helsinki to Vienna via Amsterdam. I had a lovely couple of flights on KLM. Booked Economy Comfort with slightly better legroom and recline. Cabins were a bit old, but perfectly decent. The crew were lovely, smiley and jokey, and for only £90 for both flights, this was perfectly decent, especially after factoring in the fact that you get complimentary food and drink, and we got 2 services on the flight. Overall lovely, happy and friendly flight and crew

### "searching for the booking option"
Ljubljana to Malaga via Amsterdam. I chose a flight, in the following steps they promise I can purchase check in baggage afterwards online but in reality I was searching for the online booking option for one hour and in the end called the company to hear that this was not possible! The woman on the telephone tells me that I have to buy the check in baggage on the airport counter on my day of check in. Worst is that she can't even cant even tell me how much this will more or less cost!

### "definitely fly KLM again"
Not Verified |  Our family of 9 flew Jakarta to Tel Aviv via Amsterdam and back. Usually for this route we take Turkish Airlines but as we are not happy with Turkish lately, we chose to fly KLM. We are quite satisfied with the service KLM has given us. We were all seated together on each leg, cabin crew were funny and friendly, we were given our kosher meals and the layover in Amsterdam was easy. Also all of our bags came with us on time in Tel Aviv and Jakarta. Only on the return leg Amsterdam to Jakarta (this flight stops in Kuala Lumpur) my IFE screen stopped working. But that wasn't a big deal for me. We will definitely fly KLM again for our future trips to Israel.

### "service was very impressive"
My first time flying KLM on from Dubai to Birmingham via Amsterdam, the service in both KL428 and KL1421 was very impressive. The cabin crew was very engaged and were friendly. I noticed that most of the women cabin crew to Amsterdam were more mature, but they were switched on and experienced. Breakfast was not that bad, the cost of the ticket was worth it. The inflight movies are updated with recent releases. The selection is not a lot but at least it had the good new ones. Their SMS reminders/ messages are helpful. Plus, they have a Whatsapp account that keeps you on track. KLM thank you for the seamless first experience. Hopefully my return flight to Dubai would be a wonderful experience.

### "change was done without fuss or charge"
Arrived from Brazil into Heathrow and asked to be put on an earlier flight. (I was not confident enough to book earlier flight in case my inbound was delayed). The change was done without fuss or charge. I had important work in Amsterdam (photographing my first Champions League game) so the extra time was invaluable in terms of preparation time at the stadium. The flight itself followed the familiar format of a KLM European flight, sandwich and drinks served by as always friendly crew in a well presented 737 cabin. I have flown a lot of these short hops with KLM in the last 2 years and its a really nice way to fly. Flight was expensive but I did only book it 48 hours before.

### "a very comfortable flight"
I had a great flight with KLM from Tokyo to Amsterdam in  Business Class. Decided to upgrade during online check-in for a reasonable amount of Flying Blue miles because there were a lot of open seats left. Check-in at the airport went smooth and security check was a breeze. Decided to spend some time in the Delta SkyClub lounge but wasn't really impressed by the breakfast they had on offer. Some fruits and bread rolls but nothing fancy. The seating options and the views over the tarmac were fine though. Boarding started on time and immediately after taking my seat the purser introduced herself and offered me a welcome drink. The crew on this flight was great and everything was done with a personal touch. One hour after takeoff lunch was served and the meal was great. After lunch I was able to get a couple of hours sleep in the lie-flat-seat. Think it was pretty comfortable. A second meal could be ordered any time you liked. I decided to try the guilty pleasure burger which tasted good but unfortunately the meat was still cold. After notifying the crew it went back to the oven again and after a few minutes the burger was hot and perfectly cooked. This B777-300ER was equipped with wifi but it didn't work for most of the time, probably because we flew on a very northern lattitude. When flying business class with KLM you also have to pay for using the wifi. Only the very slow message service is provided for free. I had a very comfortable flight with KLM. Their hard business class product is not the most fancy one up to todays standards but the crew really made this flight very special.

### "excellent team leader"
Johannesburg to London via Amsterdam. First time in Business Class with this airline. Very comfy layover in Skyteam Lounge with wide choice of food and drink. Fascinating to compare in flight operation with recent experience on Air France. More down to earth cabin crew, warmer welcome and more care and attention throughout the flight. Senior Purser excellent team leader. Midnight departure from JNB but they still managed a drinks run, dinner service and second drinks run in less than 90 minutes. Seat too narrow for my shoulders in full lie-flat mode, but slept ok once I put it into recline instead. Excellent breakfast. Arrived slightly early. Only a short hop to LHR but crew still managed to serve a light lunch. Arrived ahead of schedule.

### "getting better and better"
Amsterdam to Bangkok. KLM is getting better and better. Friendly staff, good food, also in between you can get enough drinks and bites. And nice new interior. Seat pitch not superb.

### "airline could not care less"
Booked KLM flight from Houston to Copenhagen (via Amsterdam). A few hours prior to departure KLM advised the Amsterdam/Copenhagen had been cancelled due to weather. I asked to remain on the Houston/Amsterdam flight but shortly after they advised me this flight too had been cancelled due to weather. Much to my surprise/dismay the Houston/Amsterdam flight took off on time whereas they re-booked me with Air France via Paris. This resulted in a more than 8 hours layover in Paris. Once in Paris I found a flight which could bring me to Copenhagen more than 3 hours earlier but KLM refused to move me to same as it was not a partner airline. I asked KLM for a lunch voucher (as per EC regulations 261/2004) and they refused same as well. This airline could not care less about your rights or needs as a customer and I would strongly warn anybody to book with same.

### "crew friendly and attentive"
Good experience, crew friendly and attentive, meals tasty and seat full lie flat and reasonably comfortable. IFE screen was not a bad size but in comparison with other airlines was a bit small. The content choice was not to my particular taste but there was enough to get me through the flight. The Indonesian meal option was one of the tastiest I've had on a plane I do like the delft house gifts that’s a nice touch. If I've got a criticism of KLM its their website. Its not that easy to find what you want and when you do find it not all the information is correct. Their webmaster could do with a shake up to sort out the content.

### "Absolute worst experience"
Mumbai to Amsterdam. Worst Airline to travel. Extremely rude and unhelpful staff. I needed water and called the air hostess multiple times but no one paid heed. It might sound unreal but I had to wait for 2 hours before someone attended me! When the air hostess finally came, she says we will serve water with breakfast. I have waited for 2 hours to get you and you want me to wait more. Ridiculous. Absolute worst experience. Have travelled so many times through various airlines but even the cheapest of airlines do not have this bad service.

### "quality of meals was very poor"
Not Verified |  Humberside to Santiago de Chile via Amsterdam. I am coeliac (gluten free) and requested the special meals. There were provided but the quality of the meals on the return flight in particular was very poor. There was not really enough to eat with the dinner (as they could or did not pad it out with bread.) I was hungry again straight after. The breakfast was particularly poor. Sometimes the special meals are provided jointly with another special type (often dairy and lactose free) and then they are particularly unappetizing. The hot part of this was small chunks of boiled potato, a quarter of a small cooked tomato and boiled spinach. Yuk! This was followed by a small fruit salad and a very small pack of some crisp bread that sticks to the teeth. At least on the way out they attempted to provided gluten free bread rolls. Those crisp breads are poor and so airy they do not curb an appetite. On a 13 hour flight this was not adequate and all the galley could offer at night were small bags of crisps (chips in American). I was lucky I had taken food of my own.

### "refuses to refund our expenses"
Munich to Havana via Amsterdam. We are still extremely angry, because KLM refuses to refund our expenses of 400 Euros that we hadbecause they did not manage to send us our luggage. We got it on day 9 of our trip – and only because we no longer let KLM handle the situation. The communication of KLM is really outrageous. KLM refused to call us back on telephone due to their "social media strategy"! You do not want to read that wearing the same clothing for more than a week. No goodwill at all on the part of KLM. I have never had to complain before in this manner (I am not one of those annoying customers). We were really looking forward to this trip and treated ourselves to business class tickets for our anniversary to have a memorable experience. Well, we have got that now. Positive points: nice food on flight from Amsterdam (much better catering than from Havana), very friendly flight attendants.

### "Service was below average"
Amsterdam to Quito and Guayaquil to Amsterdam with KLM in economy. Check-in was fine on both flights. Very average service and aircraft. I don't like the narrow seats in the 3-4-3 configuration of the B777-200ER aircraft. Hot towels have disappeared which is a shame. Taste of the meals was okay but lukewarm. Toilets were clean and entertainment was good (not that many movies). Service was below average. Service button calls were often neglected by the crew. Once I asked for a snack/drinks in between meal services. Instead of bringing me a snack they requested me to go to the service galley in the back of the aircraft. On the way back to Amsterdam KLM ran out of meal choices (only one available instead of two). After flying numerous times with Singapore Airlines in the past years I notice a big difference in hard product and service between these two airlines. Singapore Airlines is way better (hot towels, better meals with more choices, metal cutlery, bigger trays, no wine from plastic bottles, wider seats and much better service). Flights were expensive too, but not much competition to Ecuador.

### "not the same as it used to be"
Gdansk to Hong Kong via Amsterdam. The flight from Europe to Asia took place on the deck B747. It is impossible to hide that it is an old plane, there were visible traces of a long-term service. An old entertainment system, seats - deviating from the modern ones, however this plane has a soul and the journey was quite nice. Previously, many times I flew KLM and I remember it very well, very likely that the same B747. The old plane still gives a lot of joy, however the service is not the same as it used to be in the past. I asked for a beer and I am waiting till today, the rest was fine.

### "would fly with them again"
Amsterdam to London. Am really bad at flying and have a nut allergy. The staff both on the ground and in the air were amazing. They took amazing care asking if I was ok and explaining when I was worried about what was going on. I would fly with them again.

### "staff was very rude"
Not Verified |  The KLM lounge 52 in Schiphol was overcrowded and the staff was very rude (that actually applies to the whole airport). Food in the plane was awful, everything felt dirty and again, the staff lacked manners. This was a Amsterdam to London service following a fantastic trip with Garuda from Jakarta. Next time I will book the last leg separately with another company.

### "Never again KLM"
Durham to Amsterdam. Never again! Flight which was early hours got cancel and rearranged, then cancelled again and a bus taking us to Newcastle. Lost all my connections, hotel, transfers and spoiled a start of a nice holiday. Never again KLM.

### "service is nowhere near acceptable"
Toronto to Delhi via Amsterdam. I usually travel with British Airways so I was actually very excited to fly with KLM for the first time. Huge disappointment. A terrible airline with a horrible service. I was travelling with my wife and an infant son which made this journey even worse. The staff are blatantly rude to your face. For example, I was refused a bottled water for my son. Bottled water! Also, no one came when I called for an attendent using the call button. The Entertainment system is from the ancient times. In short, the service is nowhere near acceptable. They make BA look like a 7 star airline.

### "Service was strange"
Amsterdam to Curacao with KLM. Experienced a slight delay to the flight, which was explained at least. Boarding was swift. Problems started shortly after takeoff, our entertainment system didn't work, must have been the whole row as the guys next to us wasn't working either, this continued for around an hour and a half, the call bell didn't work and no flight crew came near us during this time. It was eventually fixed. The entertainment system itself wasn't great quality, sound was awful and picture was poor (to be expected on these aging jets). But it did the job. Service was strange. For some reason they stated service to rows behind us instead of just starting at the bulkhead, so the 2 rows in the middle bulkhead most have been last to be served by some margin. The food was great, just what I needed and more than I was expecting. The crew themselves seemed very friendly and seemed to enjoy their job which is a major plus, just didn't understand why they started meal service 2 rows down instead of at the front. Mostly enjoyed this smooth flight, aside from some problems that we encountered unfortunately.

### "an asset to the airline"
Denpasar to London via Singapore. An old school cabin with very dated food. The Staff though on all four of our KLM flights were exceptional and an asset to the airline. They made it a great experience. We had damaged luggage on return but don't know which leg it was from. Air France have got the quirks but they've got nothing on KLM when it comes to looking after people.

### "Extremely bad service"
Amsterdam to Washington. Extremely bad service from KLM Ground and air staff. Their computer systems are outdated and they haven't updated the latest visa on arrival countries for Indian passport holders. I was refused a boarding pass even though I showed them the new rules as published by UAE government. After an hour they issued me a boarding pass to Amsterdam and told me to fight it out in Amsterdam. It was either this or miss the flight. The food and service was average and the look you get if you order an extra coffee is priceless. The IAD-AMS route flies old planes which have the 3 pin attachment for headphones. I was lucky on both my flights to get a seat with loose headphone attachments which meant only the left earpiece worked. On my final leg, KLM managed to tear the bottom of my bag and I haven't heard a word from them and I have complained on mail, website and facebook. Took this flight as it was the cheapest option in December. I do regret my decision now.

### "Overall reasonably happy"
Not Verified |  Bristol to Atlanta via Amsterdam. Nothing either good or bad to say about the experience. Everything seemed to function smoothly including the crew. Tight 50 min connection in AMS, but still made the connecting flight with time to spare. Although huge I always the AMS is a very efficient airport. I didn't think too much of the food, but was also not the worst I've ever had. FA's seemed happy even though it was a NYE flight. They came with champagne to help celebrate the new year somewhere over Canada, but at the Dutch midnight hour. Overall reasonably happy.

### "I will avoid flying with KLM"
Amsterdam to Cape Town. Flight was fine. Food is always poor. Staff is less friendly than other major airlines. Once you sign up for their Flying blue program, prepare for spam. They will use multiple different email addresses and require you to cancel each one separately. After having cancelled all newsletters (and waiting for 2 days as described), I still receive emails. Then, try and cancel your Flying blue program. Until recently, you still had to send a paper letter to France in order to stop the program. KLM provides multiple options for contact, all which are unresponsive and slow. Multiple people have called and waited for hours for urgent matters. They respond quickly on their facebook page in order to save face, but continue to tell customers to private message them, which is terribly slow. I will avoid flying with KLM and Air France again, even though I was a loyal customer.

### "service is not the best"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Atlanta. It was a good flight with good legroom, food and IFE. But the service is not the best for Economy. KLM have a little selection of music and movies.

### "avoid this airline"
Stockholm to Amsterdam. Please avoid this airline at all costs. In the past month, my fiancé and I have travelled by air on two occasions, both including KLM. The first occasion consisted of 2 KLM connections and one IcelandAir. During this process, my checked in luggage was misplaced for two whole weeks. When it finally arrived after I travelled to Sweden, I checked the baggage tags and realised it never made it to Iceland at all (meaning one of the first two flights messed up: both KLM. They put the onus completely on IcelandAir (which is fine) and made no customer service attempt to help the customer (not fine). Now, today: we awoke for an international flight 4 hours before it departed, and found an email notifying is that our flight had been cancelled and that we'd been put on an 'earlier flight'. The flight's checkin closed the same time we woke up. Rude awakening to say the least. Our travel agent couldn't help because KLM had confirmed the tickets without getting our input, nor even attempting to contact us directly. Mind you, our notification came in at 12.30am (from our travel agent), and when we arrived at the airport, the ticket staff grilled us asking us 'why we were checking in so late. (and this was after explaining the situation). In my experience: KLM operate in bad practice, lose baggage, and point the finger at others every chance they get. Again, please reconsider using this airline if you can help it.

### "Plainly dissatisfied"
London to Amsterdam nothing special, Amsterdam to Mumbai a wonderful flight crew, biz section full. Aisle seat, comfortable weird indent on left side armrest, food awful, a smoked salmon/Thai salad? Mashed potatoes with green beans and two pieces of truly overlooked fish, no Dutch cheese lots of info about new cuisine. Crew there with drinks etc no interesting snacks and Dutch snacks can be superb, do not fly for food but expected better. Return flight on 6th January was transferred to Jet airways as KLM was over booked, seats face aisle so had two screens flashing away all night but got some sleep and only half a breakfast delivered. Lounge in AMS was packed so no food here and flight to London was super cold sandwiches. The crew to London were great. Plainly dissatisfied.

### "We will avoid this airline"
My wife and I flew from Jakarta to Atlanta with KLM. When I booked the flight it was nowhere mentioned that we would stop in Kuala Lumpur, as happened when I booked the flight from Amsterdam to Denpasar, that included a stopover in Singapore. That is not honest for such a “serious” airline. Therefore, in both flights we “lost“ around one hour and a half because of those stopovers. Besides, KLM’s system seems to be that of a third class airline since I was never able to change seats even though the system was inviting and “allowing” me to do it. Food in the Jakarta- Kuala Lumpur leg was indeed awful and in the rest of the trip was just bearable. After boarding the plane for the leg Amsterdam - Atlanta we observed something that was “strange”: the cabin crew in the back part of the plane did not show any interest in helping passengers solve their seat and hand luggage problems. The two crew ladies were very happy chatting aloud between themselves and showed no concern for the passengers. Poor service! We had’nt flown with KLM since a long time ago. We will avoid this airline as much as possible. In flight entertainment, movies in particular, is very limited. They have a limited and poor assortment of films.

### "booking still not in order"
Not Verified |  Geneva to Vancouver via Amsterdam. I initially booked this over the phone and then the trouble started, 10 one hour expensive internationals calls, each time with a different agent who had no clue about the previous call to fix payment issues, errors etc. 2 months later a day before the flight booking still not in order, more errors, promised to fix things not lived up to etc. KLM never again for me. They need to learn first what a client is.

### "Very bad customer service"
We had a flight from Oslo to Amsterdam. Because of fog at Schiphol airport the flight was cancelled. I had to take another fight from Brussels the day after and my friend had important meetings the day after. We called the call center in Amsterdam but it was too busy. We could not speak to a call center agent. We decided to immediately book a new KLM ticket for the same day but earlier. This flight was not cancelled. The tickets were 355 EUR for a very short flight. We expected KLM to refund the tickets as the call center was too busy and because of the force majeure situation. In the plane we met people that took the same flight as us but initially booked the later flight like us. They went to the airport and KLM (in fact SAS) staff booked them to the earlier flight FREE OF CHARGE. We called several times with the call center the day after but they didn't want to refund the 710 EUR. They said we had chosen ourselves to make extra costs. But for the airline (apart from credit card charges) it wasn't an extra cost at all. There were enough empty seats and we didn't take the flight the day after KLM booked us on later in the evening. They said we could try to get money back from travel insurance. They offered 2 vouchers as leniency but this was by far not the 710 EUR we had to pay for a very short European flight. Apart from the issue described my plane chair was broken and could not stand completely straight. It was a very old aircraft and they did not invest in a new chair which is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE and UNSAFE. So for a price of 355 EUR I had to sit in a broken chair. Very bad customer service and we never thought KLM was capable of doing this. Even Ryanair treats his customers better.Shame on you KLM!

### "It was a great flight"
Amsterdam to Freetown. I've become a big fan of KLM lately, having taken them numerous times on long-haul flights in the past year. Once again, they didn't disappoint. I always find their staff are cheerful, upbeat, and clearly enjoying their work; there's a real sense of fun about them, and they're always happy and willing to provide extra drinks. The cabin was recently refurbished, and was stunning: bright, airy and light - it felt really spacious, modern and minimalist. The legroom was spacious, the seats comfortable, and the IFE screens large and crystal-clear. The selection of entertainment was good. I enjoyed the meal - especially the large salad they served, and a pizza shortly before landing - as well as the copious rounds of drinks. The staff were always present and attentive. It was a great flight.

### "have three seats to myself"
Amsterdam to Bogotá, such friendly staff and delicious food on board. I always go for the cheapest tickets and I guess this time I was super lucky, my outbound flight was with KLM because I was pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. From boarding on time to getting served a meal even when you weren't starving to the stewardess actually remembering how I drank my tea.! I was lucky to have three seats to myself so I could properly sleep, but the great film selection didn't encourage that much.

### "disrespected and offended"
Amsterdam to Copenhagen. Although my flight was on time the staff was incredibly rude making the journey a very unpleasant experience. I fly quite a lot, at least once a month, and have never experienced anything quite like this before. Having worked with service myself I am always very carefully to treat service personnel with respect, and in return I expect to be respected as a passenger. After an unpleasant encounter with one of the ground staff in Amsterdam I felt incredibly uncomfortable and disrespected. I was required to check in my hand luggage as the flight was fully booked, as this would mean further delays for me I kindly asked if perhaps would have been possible for me to bring my hand luggage on the flight. The lady behind the counter told me no, without additional expressions such as "unfortunately" or "I am sorry but...". She then threatened to rebook my flight. When I told her that I had already been delayed and that it would not be possible for me to catch a later flight she replied with "that is not my problem". When I told her that I would try to repack my bag, according to her own instructions, she once again threatened to rebook my flight, despite me having told her no once already. She phrased this as a threat rather than a kind suggestion. I understand that she was tired and that her understanding of English was limited. However, I found my self entering the flight feeling incredibly disrespected and offended.

### "staff were abrupt and unhelpful"
Not Verified |  We flew KLM from Vancouver to Athens via Amsterdam on December 24th and returned on December 30th (in fact I am sitting in the airport waiting for my connection as I wrote this). Overall  the airline was on time, food offered was quite good and seats were semi-comfortable. The one big glaring issue with this airline is the ground staff and cabin crew. Ground staff were abrupt and unhelpful when asked a question and cabin crew even worse! I asked a cabin crew for some hot water with lemon slice and she was extremely abrupt and rude. I heard same cabin crew tell another passenger that he would have to wait to go to his seat as she had her drinks cart out (understandable of course and passenger wasn't asking her to move, but patiently waiting his turn); however she asked him if he expected to "jump" over the cart! Each leg of our flight contained a one or two cabin crew who were dismissive and cold - we kept hoping we would meet a friendly crew as we took 4 flights with KLM- but alas no! I was disappointed with the service of the crew as that is a huge part of the passenger's experience.

### "express my deepest disappointment"
Not Verified |  Calgary to Khartoum via Amsterdam. I am writing this review not to discuss the flight itself, which was great regarding travel times ground staff and flight attendants. I am to express my deepest disappointment in KLM as a company and how it reacts to solving customer problems. I booked a returning fight from Khartoum to Calgary and was stunned that there is a layover off 22hr in Amsterdam, and with such most airlines offer an overnight hotel stay, but I was amazed when they said they won't offer such facility despite the hefty ticket price, so I am issuing an advice to all African travelers to choose a different airline if you are traveling to and from Africa, just simply choose an airline that cares.

### "I can recommend KLM"
Athens to Mexico city via Amsterdam. Both legs were on time. Seat pitch on the ATH-AMS sector was average but on the AMS-MEX sector was excellent with plenty of space and a 180 degrees recline. Food was excellent and the service from the FA's was amazing .The whole experience was satisfying, and I can recommend KLM specially on long haul flights.

### "have to go through so much stress"
Atlanta to Lagos via Amsterdam. Issue started from ATL airport. My flight was originally meant to leave at about 8:25 pm today but because they overbooked people on this flight they downgraded me to economy class without my knowledge. I complained to the agent about my seat not being what I booked and paid for. They made me leave that airplane to sort out the issue all by myself. I spoke to one of the KLM agents and showed her my itinerary at the airport gate - who told me they were overbooked while another agent rebooked me on a business seat on another flight leaving tonight at 10:30pm after so much confusion and frustration. I called the customer service number and the Lady was nice but on getting to the lady supervisor on the phone with a three way call, she was rude, insensitive, inhumane to my plight for help after I and my wife explained the situation to her. All she kept saying was my flight was not confirmed and she can not help me even after the gate KLM agent told me it was due to overbooked flight. She went on to say the flight the KLM airport agent gave me would not work because she can not see it on the computer and she refused to talk to the airport agent at any time to resolve the issue after explaining to her the need to...so they could discuss their findings on their individual klm computers. My question to KLM corporate is why do some KLM clients have to go through so much stress and why did they choose me to be downgraded, inconvenienced and embarrassed? I would have appreciated if someone explained to me honestly what was going on instead of some KLM staff especially the supervisor being so so so nonchalant about the situation. However, I would like to commend the last KLM customer service rep my wife spoke to tonight on the phone. He was empathetic and understanding. I am really disappointed with the lady supervisor who did not make any attempt to understand the issue, not to talk about even resolving the issue. I am really disappointed with KLM as a whole and some agents do need to be retrained in dealing with issues at hand. I sincerely hope corporate will look into this matter and find ways to resolve issues like this and more. Overall, my experience today has been my teacher. I will seriously give it a deep thought before booking another flight on KLM for my future travels.

### "will be the last time"
Frankfurt to Amsterdam. First time flying and will be the last time. Flying out on 23.12.18 flight plan was 14.15 pm they open for boarding at 13.25 already so the voracious was complete at 13.05 already. Then captain announced the will be 10 min delay coz of lot of bags need to be loaded, which is understandable coz of the Xmas time 30 min later captain was announcing again in some other games issues beating around the bush not know what happen, will taking off as soon as possible etc. I am ok of the flight is Delay, it can happen but why boarding us so fast and let us stay in small box with very hot heat and I could not breath.

### "wouldn't use this airline again"
Not Verified | Amsterdam to Kiev. Just right before boarding - near the entrance to the plane - the KLM personnel took my hand luggage and did not even ask if I needed it in the cabin. My hand luggage was checked-in and sent to the rest of checked-in baggage. All the necessary things were left inside. Everything what I need between 2 flights and during a busines meeting was taken away and will be delievered to the last destination. Qualification of staff - score zero. I wouldn't use this airline again.

### "bad service and late"
Amsterdam to Rome. Expensive​, unfriendly staff, bad service and late! I chose a more expensive KLM flight for the comfort and service. Flight ended up being operated by Transavia. No problem for that, until the flight personnel said that the aircraft was smaller than expected and full, so they started to randomly check hand luggage, including mine. Of course this was free of charge, but this meant delaying my trip to pick up my luggage destination. Once on the aircraft I saw that the plane was not full at all and the overhead compartments had plenty of free space left. In addition to this, the plane took off and landed late.

### "pledged never to fly KLM again"
Norwich to Rio de Janeiro via Amsterdam. I was recently charged £90 by KLM for just being 2kg overweight on one of my suitcases even though underweight on another? I have no issue with paying for excess baggage, but I feel the loyal customers are being ripped off at £45/kg!! The excess baggage fees are applied at the airport and do not appear on the KLM website. Beware of this dreadful scam! We previously loved the airline but have pledged never to fly with KLM again.

### "customer service was incredible"
Not Verified |  Cape Town to Amsterdam. When changing my ticket for my return flight I ran into some problems on KLM's website but was quickly helped when messaging customer service. The customer service was incredible and quick and so helpful. I would definitely use KLM again.

### "Appalling and inexcusable"
I was supposed to fly from Nairobi to Amsterdam on a midnight flight. KLM let us sit on the plane for almost two hours before they admitted what they already knew when we boarded: the plane had a mechanical problem. We finally left the plane and went to baggage claim to get our bags. The Nairobi baggage claim has no chairs. There was no communication from KLM during the 3-hour wait for our luggage. When we finally got our luggage we went outside to catch a bus to a hotel. There was one bus for hundreds of passengers. We had to wait in the rain for more buses. I waited for an hour and a half before I got on a bus. Many passengers were still waiting in the rain when I left on a bus with no luggage compartment, with my bags piled on my lap and in the aisle. I reached my hotel 7 hours after my flight was scheduled to leave. Appalling and inexcusable.

### "great business class product"
New York to Sierra Leone via Amsterdam. KLM offer a great business class product. The hard product is excellent - comfortable, attractive and new lie-flat seats - but what really stands out is the service. All of the staff were friendly, cheerful, attentive, and clearly enjoying their job. Drinks were regularly and proactively offered, and the food was excellent; one dish in particular is the best meal I've ever eaten on a plane, and was presented in such a way that you'd be impressed even in a restaurant. The IFE was great - a strong selection of new and old movies, and the screens were large and clear. Since last flying KLM in September, they have improved their amenity kits with the addition of a lip balm and moisturizer (Rituals brand). Seated upstairs in the B747 was lovely, as it's such an intimate cabin.

### "300€ added to each of tickets"
Dublin to Bangkok via Amsterdam. I booked 2 tickets for the price of €670 each back in August. After getting my bank statement it turned out that the tickets were over 900€ each. After contacting KLM I was told that the price must have went up while I was in the process of buying it and they can't do anything abut it. Sent them few more emails just to been ignored. Customer service is the worst I've dealt with. I did pay extra for the leg room which I do not dispute about, it was paid separately, but to have 300€ added to each of tickets was a little bit too much.

### "should have been treated better"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to New York. Our flight got canceled. More than 300 people were lined up to re book the flights. It was a chaotic experience. Not organized for something like that. We could not get our luggage in case we want to fly on our own. Took us 4 hours to wait in line to re book the flight. Finally we got a flight that will be the next day and with transfer. I think KLM is a big company and may stand and help their customers to have better easier experience. Send us to a motel where we were given the worse food ever. And that after waiting for shuttle bus for another 2 hours. I never complain, but here we definitely should have been treated better. Such companies must be better organized. Allow people to choose the options of flying on their own. Be able to get out luggage. Be able to let people have choices. I would leave on my own if my luggage would be available to me. Hopefully someone will read that and help improve for others to have better experience in such situations.

### "nobody seemed to know or care"
London to Jakarta via Amsterdam. It’s been a week now since I left the UK. First organising the dogs at Heathrow was a nightmare, four large bags, two large crates and two worried dogs did nothing to help my stress levels and then you add the complete incompetence of KLM that gradually got worse and worse. Iit took 5 hours to get the dogs and myself thru security and check in, had to buy a bigger crate for Bluebell and then the debacle of 'unsure if they can travel now as one crates much bigger than the other one, which only made their first comment of 'oh you have two different sized crates' slightly less irritating, all organised while standing in the middle of Heathrow as the world watched with eager if not a tad annoying interest. I landed at Amsterdam in near hysterics, almost lost it with the KLM staff who gave not one jot of help. I also had nowhere to go as I was told my next flight wouldn't be until the next day at 10am and where’s my dogs? I demanded again and again, finally I heard they were in a pet hotel (which apparently is good, but that didn’t really help my anger. Remember this was business class, I expected something a bit better, no I expected a whole lot better) but that didn’t change my rage. I was then told to 'go out of airport get a shuttle bus to such and such where there is a hotel' - this was when I completely lost it - apparently KLM are supposed to organise all of that rather than leaving this man with four heavy bags in the middle of an airport. I found a hotel in the airport and tried to relax, some hope, then woken at 5am with the phone ringing and a voice telling me, 'that my flight had been cancelled as they didn’t take dogs, next flight 18.00'. Then KLM rang an hour later saying last flight been cancelled and my new flight 20.50. How are my dogs, nobody seemed to know or care. So if you are thinking of traveling great distances with your beloved pets, think one hundred times before you make this decision, KLM have offered some apology and some money back, which I find insulting but I will take it. Not the start to this new life that I had so meticulously planned and still angry at the lack of concern throughout this entire journey and to add insult to injury a very valuable collection of my photographs/posters has disappeared and even after waiting for any response as when I might see this valuable collection, there has been no help whatsoever nor have I been paid the offered compensation.

### "The food was so bad"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Buenos Aires. Old seats, old configuration. Choices on the menu incredibly horrible. The food on a long flight like this one was so bad. The crew is very good is not their fault at all. Breakfast not good. Lounge distance from the gate is miles away you can perfectly miss the flight. I would not choose KLM for the route Amsterdam Buenos Aires again.

### "a bit of a disappointment"
Overall this is a bit of a disappointment I have to say. I upgraded with SkyTeam miles (89,900 miles to be precise) from Buenos Aires to Amsterdam (my full itinerary was Santiago de Chile-Edinburgh, but only the previous segment got upgraded). I have been a customer of AF/KLM for well over 10 years, and have never been offered an upgrade or anything, which I believe says a lot about how they value their loyal customers. For this upgrade, I had to repeatedly ask the purser on Santiago-Buenos, then ground staff, before finally getting an answer! Which is still better than when you ask on Messenger or WhatsApp, and they just say 'no' without any kind of explanation--this also needs improving. Anyway, preamble over and onto the product itself. I was in seat 1 C, which had a not very charming view of a corridor leading to the flight deck, past the kitchen etc. There was also some foot traffic around here. There are only 2 toilets for the whole of Biz class on this plane, this is too little as there were queues, and also the toilets are no different from Economy, I believe they should have special touch to justify the increased cost. The seat had some pros, one being turning into lie-flat bed and various other comfy positions; there was a 17 inch IFE screen, but I didn't use it. The blanket was warm enough, and the pillow of good size. I did find the seat a bit dirty (lots of crumbs on the side) and scuffed in some areas. There was also too little storage space (I like having phone, tablets, headphones etc. in easy reach and there was barely enough space for that). The most annoying is the absence of direct aisle access, meaning the person next to you has to step over you or wake you up to get to bathroom etc. This is a big minus in terms of convenience/privacy. The staff were generally helpful, friendly and efficient, though they should come by more often to offer drinks etc. I got extremely dehydrated at one point. The food I'd say was average: a starter of prawns was tasty (though very few prawns! ), while the beef mains was chewy and bland; the dessert was dry, and the cheese selection was very limited and not that tasty. There were some good wines (though a limited range), a very tasty cocktail (but awful, dry and not fresh nuts!). The breakfast was certainly better than in economy but a bit so-so too. Coffee was tasty enough. Good touch in terms of cutlery and crockery design, especially the Delft porcelain-style mugs and bowls, very pretty. The little present a Dutch house model filled with Gin, to take home and collect (there are 99 in total) is a sweet touch. Overall, I would keep my miles and spend them on a better business class. I slept poorly due to heavy turbulence (not their fault of course!) and an overheated cabin. The seating lacked privacy and convenience, and the business cabin decor, and food, are lacklustre.

### "efficient and friendly"
Amsterdam to Lima flight was a daytime flight. Shortly after departure, lunch service commenced. A choice of 3 main courses was available served in Delft porcelain crockery and using cutlery designed by Dutch designer Marcel Wanders. Before landing in Lima, a light snack was served. I had the Angus hamburger which was quite ordinary. Overall the cabin crew were efficient and friendly throughout the flight. As it was a daytime flight, I managed to watch a movie and listen to some misic before taking a short nap before landing. The choice of entertainment onboard was adequate although I would have liked a wider and more eclectic selection from the classical music section.

### "Seat very comfortable"
Not Verified |  Taipei to London City via Amsterdam in World Business Class. Check in at Taipei airport was very easy. Terminal 2 was empty late at night and there was no queue for both business and economy class check in. Check in process was smooth and the ground agent was friendly and helpful. Immigration and security was also straight forward. In both terminals in Taipei there was no priority security lane for business class passengers. KLM uses an older China Airlines lounge in T2. Its basic but comfortable enough and I even prefer it to the flagship T1 lounge. Boarding had commenced when I reached the gate but there was a “Sky Priority” lane for all business class passengers. Once onboard a hot towel and selection of drinks (inc champagne) were offered. We were served two meals – dinner right after taking off and breakfast before landing. Dinner service was efficient so that passengers can catch up some sleep. The crew walked around often to refill champagne and wine which was appreciated. Breakfast was standard quality but after breakfast the crew came out with champagne and it was a nice touch. Overall the service was efficient and faultless although not as personal. Seat on KLM was actually very comfortable. I had a window seat and luckily the seat next to me was not occupied otherwise it would have been a task to step over the neighbour to go to the toilet. The second lag of the journey (AMS – LCY) was carried out by an E-175. The plane was new but the seat was tight. Service was really friendly, and the new catering concept worked well. Landed at LCY on time but the priority luggage didn’t come out first.

### "the seat was comfortable"
Amsterdam to Singapore. The business class cabin is laid out in a 2-2-2 configuration. It was full in business class. Shortly after take off, dinner service commenced with the senior purser coming around to take orders. She was friendly and chatty. When I told her that I had just flown in from Rio, she remarked that South America is very different culturally from Singapore and that it must have been a fulfilling experience which indeed it was. Dinner was served over the next 2 hours and I finally got to sleep for 6 full hours on this red eye 12- hour flight. With fully reclining flat bed and retractable arm rest, the seat was comfortable for a good night’s sleep. As always before landing, a flight attendant came around to hand out the Delft porcelain houses as souvenirs for business class passengers.

### "as unpleasant as possible"
Zurich to Gdansk via Amsterdam. Because we wanted to marry in a different country than we live in, I needed to transport my wedding dress on the plane. We bought the flight tickets for us both 8 months before the wedding and immediately asked KLM customer service if we could transport the wedding dress with us on board (it couldn't be sent as a luggage, because a) it would be destroyed and b) it could go missing because we had to change planes on our way). Customer service answered that yes, it's not a problem, we just need to send the exact dimensions of the dress a few days before the flight. We sent this information 3 weeks before our flight - and then it turned out that our request to take the dress has been denied because it was "too big". Of course before no one informed us that they would accept it just if it fits to a given sizes! Very upset and angry, we decided to buy an extra seat for the dress (which, because the flight was so already so close, turned out to be more expensive than the tickets for both of us together!) And then our request was denied once more. The reason: the dress is TOO FRAGILE. They suggested we put it into the luggage. You see, it was too fragile for onboard but apparently not too fragile to be sent with the luggage even though everyone knows how the airlines treat your luggage! Then we told them it's ridiculous and sent the request for buying the extra seat again, and again we were denied! This time they said that the dress is "too big" (even though it was smaller and much lighter than e.g. musical instruments, which KLM allows to transport!) We have requested again and again have been denied that it's too big and then we requested again, promising that we gonna bend it three times, so it will be smaller (which of course we were not going to do, because then the dress would be completely destroyed!) - and then finally we were allowed to buy our overpriced seat. Of course, when we were actually flying, the crew was surprised that we had been forced to buy an extra seat - because they were immediately offering us space in the storage closet, which we had requested at the very beginning! And of course no one was trying to force us to bend the dress and of course the dress fit the seat perfectly and wasn't disturbing anyone. What I do not understand, is: what do the people who make such decisions at KLM have against weddings? Why did they force us to go through all that unnecessary stress just before our wedding? The crews and the people from the customer service were really nice - why some decision making clerk, hiding behind the firewall of the customer service, was trying to make our life so unnecessarily miserable? Really, KLM, you should rethink the attitude of some of your managers - who have no direct contact with the customers, yet are doing their best to make the experience as unpleasant as possible!

### "completely disorganized mess"
Trondheim to Florence via Amsterdam. The flight was canceled so we were re-scheduled and arrived 10 hours late. The problem is that the company has made a mess with the expenses for delayed arrival. Three months after, they have not initiated the transfer of money yet despite asking me for the same receipts over 5 times. Now they claim it is due to technical error. The whole situation seems like a completely disorganized mess. This has made me never want to fly with KLM again. I get the impression that they do not care at all about customer support.

### "WiFi costly at €10 per 50MB"
Rio de Janeiro to Amsterdam. The business class on KLM’s B787 Dreamliner is configured in a 1-2-1 arrangement in reverse herringbone layout. I had the window seat 2A. As the seat is angled facing the window, there is a lot of privacy in the window seat. Even in upright mode, a person of average height like myself at 178 cm is able to rest my legs on the ottoman. There is a small storage compartment at the side with a vanity mirror which comes in useful when you want to style your hair after waking up from sleep. A 3-course dinner was served shortly after takeoff from GIG. I opted for the cream of sweet potato soup which was delicious. For the main course, I had the grilled chicken with quail risotto. It was something unusual but nevertheless tasty. Courses were served course by course and the entire dinner service took almost 2.5 hours before I was able to recline into bed mode for a restful 6-hour sleep before breakfast. It was a very pleasant experience and do hope that KLM will have more aircraft with the reverse herringbone configuration in business class. This aircraft was wifi enabled. However it was rather costly at €10 per 50MB and speed was just about adequate. Somehow this data tends to be used up very quickly after making a few Facebook posts and uploads and you will have to purchase another voucher to continue.

### "do not care about their customer needs"
Ridiculous service. I recieved a message saying my luggage was delayed when I arrived at my final destination. They said they would drive it to my location even though it was 3-4 hours away from the airport. I would receive the luggage either the same day or the day after they said. Didn’t hear anything from them this day so I called them. Then they said it was going to another address, and were about to send it in the wrong direction. They said they would fly it to the nearest airport to me instead. Then they sent it back to Amsterdam in order to send it to the nearest airport, and now they said they weren’t sure I would receive it today either. I am on holiday for two days, and I basically have no clothes and equipment for the activities I prepared. There are no stores nearby either. They really do not care about their customer needs and my whole trip is basically ruined because of their lack of service. Really do not recommend to fly with KLM.

### "nothing good to say"
Delhi to Rio de Janeiro via Amsterdam. Hopeless service. Delhi to Amsterdam only food served vegetarian, that too only rice and pulses (daal bhaat in Indian), uncomfortable seats. The steward,asked me to get water from the back of the plane as 'they don't serve at the seat'. I will never ever travel on KLM again. Seats uncomfortable. Drinks - don't ever think of a repeat, you won't be served. I have nothing good to say about this airline.

### "Not overly enthusiastic"
Not Verified |  Denpasar to Amsterdam via Singapore with KLM. Not overly enthusiastic. Aircraft was tidy. Legroom was good. Good information from flight deck. Meal service far below average. In both flights no meal option was presented, you get what is on offer. In my opinion not sufficient for a long-haul flight while other airlines standard is to present a menu with meal options. Staff seemed a bit rushed and didn't really spend a lot of attention to its customers. Inflight entertainment is so-so. Movie options just about OK, but more options would be preferable. On the AMS-SIN flight there was an electronic malfunction while at the gate. Took an hour to be fixed while aircon was off. Will choose Singapore Airlines again next time.

### "I would fly again with KLM"
Not Verified |  Manchester to Houston via Amsterdam. Superb service, great flight and comfortable seats. The only thing they could improve would be the food. Great selection of movies, music and TV Shows to select from and I found the KLM app to be incredibly helpful. As a nervous flyer, I'm always cautious when using a new airline but I would fly again with KLM without hesitation. Thank you

### "Crew was very friendly"
Bangkok to Prague via Amsterdam. Crew was very friendly and paying attention. Food on long haul flight was delicious and seats was comfortable. For next time a would be happy if crew dim the lights for the flight, even if its day flight.

### "nothing to complain about"
Amsterdam to Southampton with KLM Cityhopper. I was bumped up from a regular coach seat to their extra legroom seat at no additional cost. The airplane was  new and pulling up to the area where they all were it looks like their  fleet of Embraer’s are also new. Because these are short hop flights you have to go from a bus and up a staircase. On this short flight that is 1hr 10 mins you  get half a sandwich, soft drink, water, and  a small dessert. There was nothing to complain about. The plane was new, comfortable, and they even fed you, something that an USA based airline would never do.

### "I upgraded to business"
This was a Delta flight operated by KLM. I upgraded to business from economy for around $500 at the gate. I was a bit disappointed to find out that the equipment had been changed from a Boeing 787  to a 777 however I was looking forward to the KLM business experience. If you have Air France points always ask because the original price to upgrade was around $900 however just for being a member of the Air France loyalty program, the price dropped down to a little bit under $500 and I did not have to use points. Keep in mind you have to ask and hopefully find an agent that is nice enough to do it for you. Upon boarding, it was obvious that the 777 was old however it was well-kept. The bathroom was very nice and had Dutch themed wallpaper with all kinds of amenities inside. They serve you a hot meal that includes an appetizer,  entrée, and everything you can drink every two hours. They use beautiful china, glass, nice silverware, and beautiful linen napkins. Two hours before landing they serve you a  hot breakfast. They also give you a nice little Dutch themed ceramic house with liquor inside as a  gift which I thought was a lovely touch and your choice of chocolate. The seat was large, very comfortable, and with plenty of storage. The  amenity kit however was quite basic. It included a pair of poorly made socks, something to cover your eyes that resembled a mask, earplugs, only flimsy toothbrush with a tiny bit of toothpaste, all inside a cheap looking zipper bag that looked like a coin purse. Needless to say after using a few items inside I left it on board. There was no Wi-Fi on this flight and the entertainment options were decent for a 7 hour flight. Overall I have always been a fan of KLM they do it right whether you are in coach or in business, I would fly them every  time if I could. They leave on time, they take care of you on board, the airplanes have plenty of space, and even the old ones are well-kept.

### "don't stand behind stated policies"
San Francisco to Glasgow via Amsterdam. As an airline, KLM does a nice job. However they totally give lip service to a stated policy for extra seats. On my recent trip to Scotland, I purchased an extra seat round trip to accommodate my size, so that I would not inconvenience anyone sitting next to me. On KLM's website, they state they will refund the cost of the extra seat should the flight[s] not be sold out. On all 4 legs of my journey, there were open seats. Upon return home, I submitted my request [with supporting documentation] for reimbursement. A month later, and my request has been met with stonewalling and silence. I am not wealthy, and it took a long time to save for that ticket. I resent the fact that they don't stand behind their stated policies, and want to warn anyone else thinking they are an upstanding business to think twice.

### "cheerful and efficient"
Singapore to Amsterdam. The KLM B777-300ER used on KL836 on 19 October 2018 was the SkyTeam livery aircraft. Business class was full. Seating is in 2-2-2 configuration. I was seated at 1H. The cubby hole below the TV console was spacious and when fully reckoned, the bed is 6 feet in length. The flight attendants were cheerful and efficient for both supper service and breakfast service. Unlike Asian airlines which serve course by course, KLM serves every course on a tray in the interest of efficiency. Before landing, each business class passenger is given one of 99 Dutch Delft Porcelain Houses containing Bols Dutch gin. I had a full uninterrupted 7 hours of sleep after supper before breakfast was served. Overall, KLM World Business Class is what it is called - business class for the business traveller who wants to maximise his time catching up on work and sleep.

### "very few passengers on board"
Nice to Amsterdam. Although I booked a KLM flight, this particular flight was operated by Transavia -in KLM style (service etc). Everyone knows that seat pitches of Transavia planes are terrible, unless you get a seat from the exit row which I did. There were very few passengers on board and this made the flight a great chill and fun for everyone. Cabin crew was excellent, meal was a decent sandwich and drinks were served twice, KLM should move themselves to Terminal 1 at the Nice Cote d'Azur airport, they really do not fit to Terminal 2 there. I have lounge access and spent my time in there rather than the terminal waiting area, but not everyone does. I also had second thoughts about Transavia operating a KLM flight for obvious reasons. Although I enjoyed this particular flight very much, I know I would not have enjoyed this if the plane would have been packed. However, I will rate according to the specific experience, which I enjoyed a lot.

### "journey was really a pleasant one"
Amsterdam to Nice. I really like KLM. Ground service worked like a charm in Amsterdam, everything was on time, our seats on Economy Comfort had great pitch. KLM's meals on short haul flights are simple little bites, but I am a fan of their delicious wrap. Although the plane was relatively worn, there was no follow-up coffee service, and no IFE as usual by their in-Europe flights. This journey was really a pleasant one.

### "poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Humberside to Sydney via Amsterdam / Abu Dhabi. They simply did not care. I am a gold member of their loyalty program - I booked my flight on the KLM website - after specifically asking questions about benefits privileges and differences - as the flight was a code share - was told there would be no difference. Lie number 1. I booked the ticket and went to book seats online. I could book KLM seats but not partner (the message on screen said seating plan is currently unavailable try later) - Lie number 2. I called after booking to reserve seats and was told I needed to do this with Etihad, I called Etihad and they said it wasn’t possible and I needed to do this with KLM or at the airport: meaning that I would get whatever seat was available 3 hours before the plane would leave - for an 8 hour and a 14 hr flight that’s just not acceptable - and certainly not like for like with KLM operated flights. When I complained I was told I could cancel my flight at a cost. In the time taken going backwards and forwards between the many KLM service departments other flight costs had risen significantly and I was trapped. After this experience on the way out I asked about upgrades I couldn’t use points for the KLM part and I couldn’t pay for the Etihad part my option was to upgrade to business class which cost more than the original ticket. I have done many long haul flights with various operators - KLM included - some code share some not. I am now sat at the airport waiting for the check in desk to open, I tried on the KLM app where it was not possible, they advised to use the self service at the airport - that’s not possible. So I’m sat here until the desks open, thank you KLM. This is not as described when I specifically asked this stuff before booking. The flights in themselves were ok but this level of misinformation and poor customer service is inexcusable. I would not have booked this flight if I had been told the truth when I called before booking. And I will not put up with this again

### "Excellent service onboard"
Amsterdam to Helsinki. Excellent service onboard. Comfortable seats and all in all a very smooth and pleasant flight from Amsterdam to Helsinki. Lost luggage was delivered prompt the following day and the airline kept us well informed about the situation all the time. Thank you - we´ll come back!

### "pleased to have flown with KLM"
Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam. I am delighted to say that I am very pleased to have flown with KLM. An overall clean airplane, great customer services and well done on anti age discrimination. Thats a number 1 for me. I usually see young bloods running around serving customers but with KLM there was more mature ladies then young ones. They smile more and get things done quickly and correctly. Thank you KLM.

### "Thank you wonderful crew"
From a nightmare to the best plane trip ever. Amsterdam to Montreal. My husband had his wallet stolen the day before in Rome with passport, 2 credit cards and 400 euros. We were desperate after running to the Canadian Embassy to get an emergency passport which was successful. We told our story to the crew and asked if we could sit from where we were in front of the lavatory, no recline. The crew took care of us and found seats in front comfort E, great food, wine, a card with a lovely message, small gifts we appreciate. We hope to visit one day the Netherlands and of course it would be with KLM. Thank you wonderful crew.

### "flight was good"
Amsterdam to Stuttgart. This flight was good! Friendly staff who did put my luggage in another place so not to have it under the seat. A service on board that is a "service" and not only water, and landing in time at the gate without the need to use the bus (which never happens with the Germans).

### "the worst customer service"
KLM has the worst customer service ever. I tried to book a flight online yesterday evening and something in the system went wrong. During the booking, I was redirected to log in - which I did, and there is was said that the flight was booked. I couldn't get to the payment page at all. We contacted the helpdesk, informing them about the situation but no direct answer. Today, when we checked, the booking was gone and the flight now was suddenly double the price. I contacted KLM on 3 different ways to discuss the matter, as they say on their website - FB, whatsapp and customer form. The reply on FB was not at all towards what my complain was about. On whatsapp there was no reply at all and the customer form has been left unreplied up to now. I find it unacceptable that due to their system error, I now need to pay 2x as much for the same flight and then, that there is no one facing the customer for answers.

### "Worst customer service"
Amsterdam to Ibiza. Worst customer service ever. We booked a KLM flight Via Amsterdam. After first leg was delayed more than 1h (operated by Pegasus) and we missed our connection, as well as the automatic rebooking due to the huge airports and long security lines, they refused to help us and sent us out of the terminal to Pegasus who sent us back to KLM . No desire to help at the transfer desk. Made us feel totally helpless.

### "one of the best flights I've had"
Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi . This turned out to be a great flight. We chose KLM because it was cheaper and this ended up being one of the best flights I've had. The food was really really good and the best food Ive had on a plane. The staff was really friendly and helpful.

### "I have heard nothing back"
Amsterdam to Salt Lake City (a KLM booked flight operated by Delta Air Lines) was delayed, which caused, that we had to take a later flight from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas. All-in-all a 7 hour delay. I fully understand, that this can happen from time to time and EU regulations dictate, that we are entitled to a €600 compensation each. As soon as we came home again, I filed the claim for compensation and after more than a month, I have heard nothing back from KLM yet. I have even requested information about expected processing time with no reply at all.

### "unable to make my outbound flight"
I booked a return flight from London to Medellin in Colombia with KLM (and LATAM domestic flight from cartagena to medellin). Due to unforseen circumstances i was unable to make my outbound flight and was forced to rebook the outbound leg. When it came to return to London I checked in for my LATAM flight no problem however the KLM website would not allow me to check in. Upon phoning the customer service department i was told that KLM have a policy that if you miss your first flight they are legally allowed to cancel all of the other flights you have with them. They are not required to inform you that this will happen or provide you with a refund. I was forced to also rebook my return flight with another airline.

### "40 Euro per checked bag fee"
Southampton to Strasbourg via Amsterdam. I chose to fly with KLM via AMS, with the return journey via CDG - by TGV train to CDG and onward with Flybe (Air France flight number). I made my booking with Expedia. Basically, everything was fine. The flights via Amsterdam were fine but the connection time was a bit tight because of passport control. The return journey was fine - Strasbourg station check-in was excellent, as was the TGV - I shall definitely consider TGV connections via CDG again. However, FlyBE is an experience I do without. Late. Appalling on board catering which they have the cheek to charge for. The flights to AMS and Strasbourg offered acceptable food and drink for free and the service was very correct. What did surprise me was the 40 Euro per checked bag fee in each direction. The Expedia site did not give a warning of this and it was not clear from the ticketing documentation - it came as a surprise at check-in.I hace flown a couple of thousand times and consider myself a seasoned traveller, I know that such fees are common with budget airlines like Ryanair, Easyjet and some US domestic airlines, but I have never experienced this with established airlines like KLM or AF, I normally fly Star Alliance (LH, TK, LX) or Aeroflot. So I was unpleasantly surprised. This represented a hidden charge of ca 30%, and it was not at all clear in the booking process. It would probably not have changed my airline choice or route planning, nut I would have liked to know in advance. The Southampton experience was good (particularly on the return - the train connection is outstanding, but the departure lounge somewhat dismal). I live in West Dorset, so it is great to have a hassle free airport as an alternative to LHR or LGW. My wife is a Russian national, so the passport queue on arrival was a pleasant surprise.

### "experience has really been bad"
Milan to Trondheim via Amsterdam. Delayed baggage, simply not managed. Flying via connecting airports may result in delayed luggage; it's annoying but it happens. what I can't understand about this flight is why: my luggage was not boarded in the next flight (in the afternoon), but in the one after that (in the evening). The  communication about my luggage from KLM or their handling partner has been virtually nonexistent. I had to purposedly go to TRD Airport the day following my arrival, since there has been no attempt to deliver my luggage to my hotel I had previously flown KLM and via AMS; this time the experience has really been bad with awful baggage service (comparing to other times my baggage has been delayed in other airports)

### " Staff are always friendly and efficient"
Another great journey with KLM. The airline provided excellent lounge facilities, 3rd party at Barcelona and its own at Amsterdam. Flights were both very nice, Economy Comfort provided at no cost to Platinum card holders is an excellent benefit and the few extra inches make the flights much more comfortable. In-flight refreshments were excellent, I was upgraded for the second flight so they were even better but even in economy there is a good selection of drinks. Staff are always friendly and efficient in my experience and these flights did not disappoint. My only suggestion would be that KLM/Air France follow the rest of the market and offer the Economy Plus "comfort" benefit to 1 passenger accompanying the Platinum cardholder, its really the only thing that I don't like about these airlines. Thanks again KLM.

### "Very impressed on this short flight"
Very impressed on this short flight from LBA to AMS on KL1550 on the 19th of June. The flight departed on time. The cabin crew were very polite and offered us a snack and drink on this short flight. Landed on time too. Honestly cant fault them. The price was fantastic too in comparison to low cost carriers! I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again, given other airlines like BA now charge for food and drink on European flights. Well done KLM!

### "meals wasn't competitive"
Los Angeles to Istanbul via Amsterdam. First of all, check-in was not good at all. The lady was so sullen. She kept answering my questions like: No, no and no! She never smiled, never! I mean like it was a bad experience checking in. I'd give the flight crew somewhere between 8 to 9 out of 10. They were friendly. There were 2 meals served during an 11-hour flight which wasn't competitive when compared to its competitors like Delta, Turkish Airlines, and Qatar Airways. Although the food was good. There was also a box made of cardboard where you could get some snacks (4 kinds) Salty crackers, mentos, raisin bar and also small chocolates. But the curtain was closed almost everytime during the flight and the flight attendants were chatting inside so you couldn't get in. I could get snacks for only like an hour or so.

### "most incompetent flight crew"
Amsterdam to Vienna. Rudest and most incompetent flight crew I ever encountered. Super chaotic boarding, bad planning and no politeness whatsoever when they talk to customers - a flight attendant hits me on the head because he is not paying attention where he shoves his elbow and then instead of saying “Im sorry” and being polite, he is rude. Never book this airline if you have an alternative.

### "the worst quality plane"
Amsterdam to Copenhagen. We purchased Flight tickets for KLM for a business trip, but were put in the worst quality plane from Carpatair, a Fokker 100, which is a plane built before 1997. It had a computer error causing us a 1.5 hour delay. Never want to fly with KLM again if I can avoid it.

### "Staff were among the best"
Amsterdam to Ibiza. I checked-in online and traveled only with a hand-luggage, so everything was extremely smooth and fast on the ground - loved it. Plane was pretty worn and old, I even had a leakage for a few minutes above my head from the air-conditioning and I was not the only one, there goes a point. Staff were among the best I have ever seen - very good service with lots of smile. I was satisfied with the meal service, both pasta and wine were better than I expected. However, there was no IFE at all - there goes another point. Overall: Price-Quality range of KLM is pretty high.

### "aircraft was really old"
Amsterdam to Toronto. The aircraft was really old, charging port was not working, IFE was really really limited, basically few movies from 2000s, the ones that were at least popular. It was really pain on a long flight because there was not even 1 good movie. The food was pretty good, cabin crew were nice, but it was full flight so they were slower. Value for Money not worth it. Seat were OK but limited IFE touchscreen were not working or really needed to punch the screen to work.

### "love the personable approach"
Amsterdam to Singapore. Love the KLM personable approach. Sure, Garuda has inflight chef (business) and probably twice the staff, but I miss the personality. With KLM crew you can expect a good service plus a nice chat about the destination or purpose of your trip. If you want to at least. They make me feel at home and that's why I chose flying blue as my program of preference and almost three years as Platinum member. KLM for 5 star airline!

### "two very good flights"
Seoul to Freetown via Amsterdam. I think KLM has a great product in their new Business seats - fully flat, spacious, and well designed. Whilst the AMSto  Freetown  leg was in their old recliner seats, it was comfortable enough for a relatively short trip. I found staff consistently good - they are friendly, cheerful and fun, and they seem to enjoy their work. The second leg in particular was very attentive, proactive staff, who addressed passengers by name, and were generous with drinks and food. KLM has great tableware, and all of the meals were pretty good too. Their amenity kits leave a lot to be desired (no skin care) but little touches - like coming around with a box of chocolates, offering plenty of snacks, and the gift of the gin-filled Delft house - really make up for it. IFE was good - they often have an interesting selection, and not just mainstream blockbusters. All in all, two very good flights.

### "wheels broken off my luggage"
Budapest to Boston via Amsterdam. This is the second time I have had the wheels broken off my luggage by KLM or Delta Air Lines. On this particular flight I was traveling for business from Europe to the East Coast and my luggage never arrived. I had a conference to attend on Wednesday evening when I landed which I missed because I had to go buy work clothes. My conference ran through Thursday and I am lucky that I bought more than one outfit because my bag didn’t arrive until Friday even though I was told my bag would arrive the next day! Every time I called the baggage claims department it would take an hour to even speak to anyone. When my bag finally did arrive it was damaged and missing a wheel. I had to submit two claims one for reimbursement of the clothes I bought and another for my damaged bag. A check was finally received a month later for my damaged bag but to this day I am still waiting to receive a check for the clothes.

### "never fly with them again"
Amsterdam to Singapore. Greedy airline  that fits 10 tiny seats in a row in a 777-300 plane, which makes it impossible to sit comfortable in a 13 hours flight. It is so horrible that there is no way to avoid not sitting squeezed, shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you, and I am not a big person. And my seat was a so called "economy comfort" seat, the other seats clearly had a matching small leg space as well. Not clean plane had a face mark on the window from the previous passenger, I cleaned it myself. Terrible food.. They used to be a very nice airline but after that experience I will never fly with them again.

### "Absolutely terrible."
Catania to Amsterdam. Absolutely terrible. Currently sitting in a boiling aircraft beside a soiled seat with no drink, food, or entertainment options. We asked about all the above and were told this is the way it is and that "our complaining would not solve the problem". Do not fly KLM, pay the extra bucks and keep your comfort and sanity in check!

### "comfy way to travel overall"
Amsterdam to Toronto. KLM's long-haul business class service in their new aircraft models offers a good product and a comfy way to travel overall. At the airport boarding was smooth and biz class passengers used their own door to enter (in YYZ only one door used for deboarding but they asked eco passengers to wait for us to get out first). The flight was fully booked but everything worked well and the crew had the nice touch of addressing passengers with their names. Selection of drinks and food was good, and can't be complained at all. The new seats fold fully flat and are spacious, though lacking in storage space (apart from overhead bins). IFE had a reasonable selection of movies and the ability to play multiplayer games against another passenger (like Yatzee) was fun. I was missing the aircraft (outside) camera options from IFE but I assume B787 does not have this option in the way for example A350 has... Wifi was available but ridicuously priced, by megabytes instead of time used. And surprisingly it was not free even in business class, like with some competitors.

### "Below par short-haul business class"
Helsinki to Amsterdam. Below par European short-haul business class service. Ground services worked very well at HEL airport. Onboard the seat is the normal, comparable to economy seat but with middle seat blocked (by unnecessary plastic box), and in shorthaul you pay for the service and convenience of skipping queues when in biz class. Compared to other airlines KLM's short-haul business product is lacking a bit. In this morning flight there were no newspapers, their bubbly wine was of the cheapest possible kind (Codorniu, vs. actual champagne served by some airlines, and KLM longhaul), and the breakfast options ran out when they got to row 2 already (though the food I got was still okay, just nothing to choose from). Cabin crew was also rather relaxed in letting economy class pax cross the curtain and use biz class toilets. No IFE at all. No Wifi. Crew were nice and cheerful.

### "friendly, outgoing, and attentive"
Freetown to Hong Kong via Amsterdam. The Freetown - Amsterdam leg was with the old Business Class seats, whereas the second leg to Hong Kong was with their new World Business Class seats. Whilst the second leg was obviously a superior product, the old seats were acceptable for a reasonably short flight. Crew on both legs were very good - friendly, outgoing, and attentive, and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Food was good, though the selection of wine was reasonably limited and not particularly exciting nor high-end. Crew made sure I was constantly topped up. Really loved their crockery and cutlery - cool designs and a nice touch. Bathrooms had good Zenology products, but the amenity kits were seriously lacking - no body care products at all. The IFE was good - there was enough choice, and it was a pleasure to watch on the large screens. Loved the little houses filled with gin that they passed out. Really enjoyed both flights.

### "I am very disappointed"
Amsterdam to Bangkok. Whilst the flight was boarding and I was in my seat I noticed a sickening Sweaty feet smell. Someone had taken of their shoes and the smell was horrendous. I was trying to figure out where it was coming from. After take off when I got up to go to the toilet I saw the lady sitting behind me holding a tissue covering her nose and mouth. The man in 60b next to her was the one were the bad smell came from. I went to speak to the purser and told her the situation and she told me she had smelt it too but also didnt know where it was coming from. I asked her if she could please do something. She basically giggled and said "what do you expect me to do or say about it" that is not how you deal with a problem, especially not when you are a customer service manager. (they get trained for these situations) She went to the man and told him carefully about the smell and asked him "could you please put your shoes in a plastic bag" and left it at that. It didn't make it any better as the smell was coming from his dirty feet and socks too! After about 20min the smell still hadn't gone and when the purser walked by I told her that it still smells really bad. She said "the gentleman had put the shoes in a plastic bag" when I said it is not only his shoes that were the problem but also his socks and feet she basically gave me an angry look and walked away not to been seen for the rest of the flight. I among others were forced to sit in this smell for 10.5 hours from take off till landing. This is unacceptable. I felt super bad for the Thai lady behind me in 60a as she was squashed in her seat as the man was also very big and showed no consideration for her space plus the smell was even more unbearable for her. I think the way the purser went about it was ridiculous. She should have asked him to put his shoes back on and show a little bit more customer care. It is a long haul flight and to sit in that smell for that amount of time is unacceptable, especially if you have paid almost 900 euros for a ticket. I am very disappointed with this service. To make matters worse, after they served breakfast about 1.5 hours before landing the lady in 59c next to me started vomiting. I was handing her more sickbags from other seat pockets. In this time flight attendant walked by and didn't ask the poor woman if she was okay when she was clearly sitting with a sickbag on an aisles seat in full view of the crew passing by. I must say this has been the worst flight I have ever had. I am very disappointed in the lack of care of the crew and ground staff.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Amsterdam to London. Due to terrible traffic I arrived a few minutes late at baggage drop off in Amsterdam. Unfortunately, the computer said no and I was unable to check my baggage. Customer service was very helpful and put me on standby for the next flight, not to LCY but LHR, helped me check my bags and gave me a boarding pass for the flight one hour later. At the gate, KLM ground staff were very understanding and friendly and informed me I would be able to board. In my experience, KLM staff on board is helpful and nice.

### "crew were very impressive"
Santiago de Chile to Buenos Aires. Check in at Santiago de Chile was easy, no queues at bag drop (2:15 before scheduled departure), check in assistant was very helpful and explained arrivals information for Buenos Aires. Aircraft left Santiago early and landed in EZE early- nice cabin didn’t look worn at all and the seats had decent leg room. The aircraft was about half full which meant there was plenty of space to stretch out on this 1:35 minute flight. The crew were very impressive most were trilingual speaking Dutch, English and Spanish. Lunch consitisting of a tasty pasty was offered, a drinks service followed and the flight finished with tea and coffee about 40 minutes before landing. Upon arriving in EZE the ground crew were there ready to assist passengers continuing to Amsterdam. Baggage arrived swiftly and in good condition. The ticket cost £150 for a single.

### "sitting in a pile of claims"
Birmingham to Minneapolis via Amsterdam. When an airline has so many lost luggage claims that after 45 days, your claim still hasn't been started, you have to ask yourself "Is KLM the right airline to fly with?". I have no complaint about the the planes, the staff or the on board experience, they're all pretty good. Where this airline fails is when they delay your flights because of missing catering, lose your luggage, smash that luggage and I lost some valuables. All of this happened to me in one flight. Trying to get their customer care team to acknowledge my claim and begin the investigation is proving to be more difficult than landing a vehicle on Mars. The day after I arrived back, my luggage arrived at my house and it was broken beyond repair, and missing several items. As I write this, it's been 45 days since I made first contact about this, and my claim is still sitting in a pile of claims, waiting to be started. Each time I call, my claim is being "escalated to a manager", only to find out the next time I call that this didn't happen. I've had every excuse available and not their staff hang up when I call. I have to use my colleague's mobiles so the support team does not recognise my number. If you are planning to book with KLM, only do so if you are only taking hand luggage with you, and you're prepared never to make a claim against the airline for anything else because, it's highly unlikely they will process your claim. The biggest frustration is, I enjoyed flying with them, it's just their Customer Care team that letting the airline down.

### "where is the hot meal?"
Porto to Berlin via Amsterdam. This is my first time with KLM and the leg from OPO-AMS was a disillusion mainly by the meal. The flight departed at 11.00am and arrived arround 14.20pm (2.20h flight - in OPO we've CET-1) and according to the KLM site, at lunch time and in flights with more than 2 hours, it shall be served a hot meal. But the meal had water, a juice, a cup of tea or coffe and a small slice of limon cake. Where is the hot meal? The meal in leg AMS-TXL (an 1 hour flight) the meal was better - a wrap with the same beverages. The seat is ok with medium legroom (but I've 1.93m). The flight from OPO to AMS was delayed by 20 minutes due to traffic in Porto city that cause the late arrival of all the crew. However, should be a company which I'll use again.

### "I would highly recommend"
Singapore to Denpasar. This was my first time flying KLM  World Business Class. The flight left slightly later than scheduled due to the late arrival of the aircraft. This flight is a 5th freedom flight from SIN to DPS as the flight originated in AMS. I was In seat 1A and was very impressed with the seat. Highly adjustable to whatever position you want. There is power available to charge your electronics. The seat was a little dirty but I put this down to it not being the first flight and the tight turnaround, nothing abhorrent. The only downside is the immovable ottoman footrest. If you are under 5’7” you may struggle to reach it. The inflight entertainment was very good with a wide range of movies and tv shows as well as an interactive map showing you the route. It was much more responsive than other IFE systems that I have used recently and the remote is touch screen which helps a lot. The food was respectable for such a short flight, with two choices for the main, either chicken or beef with all the trimmings. Altogether when the salad and desert it was very tasty and the crew kept filling up drinks and offering bread rolls. I was surprised to get a meal on this flight but I was glad I did. The crew themselves were very happy which was pleasant and they were very attentive. The KLM houses were a unique experience as no other airlines do this. I got house number 28 and it is filled with a Dutch Gin. Overall it was a nice flight compared to the competitors on the route and was very well priced for a business product. I would highly recommend.

### "on time, very comfortable"
Washington to Amsterdam continuing to Tallinn via KLM/airBaltic codeshare. As a general rule the long-haul flight went well - on time, very comfortable Economy Comfort seats, friendly and attentive cabin crew, plus very smooth connections via Schiphol. However, I must agree with an earlier poster here that KLM's catering department does appear to have lost the plot a bit, at least in tourist class, with meals featuring very fatty chicken. (This had happened to me before with KLM, as I mentioned in an earlier post in this forum about a year ago). At least they did do two drinks-trolley runs, which were much appreciated. If they'd just pick up their game a bit on inflight meals, these annual trips of mine via Amsterdam to the Baltics would be close to perfect. I remember some years ago being served on a KLM AMS-IAD flight a delightful platter of meatballs and mash - please reinstate that!

### "Boarding was efficient"
Today's flight was 100% booked which was to be expected since our flight was on the first Sunday of the Dutch School holidays. Through the Dutch media we were warned that Amsterdam Schiphol airport should be overcrowded. Through the KLM website we received the advise to arrive at the airport 3hrs before departure. Since we can use the Skypriortity fast track services at this airport we took our chance and arrived 2 1/2hrs before flight and slipped through luggage drop-off and security in less than 15 minutes! Boarding was efficient and on time, on board we were welcomed by the crew who had the time for a chit-chat with all passengers while boarding. The flight departed and arrived well on time. The onboard service consisted of a warm sandwich and a drink followed by a 2nd round when muffins were distributed. We had exit seats (pre-booked) which are the best seats on the plane with tons of legroom. Disembarkation in Lisbon was OK but we had to wait over 30minutes for our luggage to arrive on the belt. However our golf bags who arrived on a separate belt for special luggage were delivered promptly.

### "would greatly recommend"
Amsterdam to Athens. A friend and I missed our flight due to unforeseen circumstances and the KLM transfer lady went out of her way to accommodate us. She was super nice and understanding. We received outstanding customer service and would greatly recommend this airline to anyone.

### "deserves better food"
Rome to Calgary via Amsterdam. The flight and seats themselves were fine. The entertainment excellent, but the food was disgusting. We were literally given a frozen salad like substance called “pesto”, the chicken was all a fatty substance, the stroop waffle dessert was like a giant mushy just thawed mess. The pizza? Gummy, and my child couldn’t even tolerate it. Premier economy deserves better food. I can’t suffer through 20 hours of travel with such poor food again at the cost we paid of 2000$ a ticket.

### "KLM lost a customer"
Budapest to Amsterdam. Today KLM lost a customer, i'll mever flight with KLM again. Thestaff was very rude and forced us to check in our hand luggage while we specifically upgraded to seat in the fronts as premium economy in order to be sure to catch our connection. The flight was late 45 minutes so we made sure to be at the gate early in order to get in as soon as possible. We who were on time have been punished to check our luggage while everyone who arrived late could keep their luggage. Klm's policy to punish people on time and to reward late on is very unfair.

### " never booking  KLM/Air France again"
I am never booking a flight with KLM/Air France again! I travelled with my 5 year old son for the first time. They booked us on seats two rows apart. I called them several times but they could do nothing and told me to handle it myself on the airport (just be sure to be at least 4 hours in advance!) also the booked food (I have a gluten allergy) were not served. Even when I showed them the details of the booking where you could see the preferences they could not do anything. So no food for 11 hours and no apologies. In the end I send an email with the details and the only thing I received was a summary of my complaint and we hope that you fly with us again! No never!

### "unhelpful and unapologetic"
I was traveling with 3 other people from Genoa to Amsterdam. We were expected to land in Amsterdam 5 hours before our flight from Amsterdam to the US. This did not happen. KLM cancelled our flight and despite my efforts of keeping our travel group together the KLM staff separated me and the people I was traveling with into two groups. My friend and I were placed on a plane that landed in Frankfurt, Germany so late we were unable to grab our connecting flight to Amsterdam. The KLM staff was very unhelpful and unapologetic. My friend and I were forced to buy a separate ticket to get back to the U.S. from Frankfurt which cost us over $2,000.00 each. and caused us to have two tickets for one plane. Once we got back we expressed our concerns and KLM only refunded us $300.00. I wanted to share my experience so that others know what you may run into when using this airline. Safe travels!

### "worst experiences ever"
Cardiff to Turin via Amsterdam. KLM always gives me the worst experiences ever. And this time again. The hand luggage was taken from me when I was already on the plane due to lack of space: it has not arrived to destination and the risk is that it has gone lost. Tthe 2 connecting flights were both operated by KLM but they did not manage the delay and did not organise any transfer in Amsterdam that make sure that we would not miss our flight. Many travelled complained since many connecting flights were not managed and people had to stay overnight in Amsterdam. While staying overnight I was not allowed to have my hand luggage back. In the end such hand luggage didn't reach the final destination and since the ticket on the suitcase was handwritten (done onboard as explained). I really doubt it will ever get back to destination. Last but not least the personnel in the planes and in the airport was always very unfair and it was impossible to speak to a responsible manager. It's the 3rd time I have this same kind of adventure with KLM. I strongly recommend to choose another company I will never fly KLM again. When I had similar problems with Lufthansa they always managed the situation very properly and fairly.

### "Fantastic customer service"
Delayed at Athens due to thunderstorms over Germany we missed our connection to Durham Tees Valley. On our flight to Amsterdam we were kept informed of status regarding connection flights. KLM cabin crew and ground staff handled the situation efficiently and with a smile. We were transferred onto the next flight the following morning and a voucher given for a free courtesy bus to/from the Ibis Hotel at no extra cost to ourselves. Fantastic customer service and an airline we'll be using again.

### "very satisfied with this flight"
Prague to Amsterdam. I am very satisfied with this KLM flight. The plane seemed in a very good condition, provided spacious economy seating, had very professional treatment from the ground staff, to the cabin crew, and to the pilot himself who kept us updated at all times, and was able to arrive just on time. The only negative thing I would say is that it lacked entertainment system.

### "a very bad experience"
Nairobi to Washington via Amsterdam. I had a very bad experience flying KLM. I bought my round trip tickets from the KLM official website to fly from Dulles airport to Nairobi and back. I'm a green card holder but my 2 children that flew with me (ages 3 and 11) are American citizens. Flying into Kenya had 1 connection stop at Paris CDG which went fine. Our return flight had 2 connections, Paris and Amsterdam which, to my greatest shock, is not okay with a green card but is ok with an American passport. I requested to have my children fly as unaccompanied minors while I reschedule my flight at extra fees bit I was denied that. All I was told is to exit the airport go home until I could raise enough money to buy new tickets with 1 connection in Europe or reschedule our flight at $817 each to fly the next morning. So, I had to pay an additional $1634 for my children that were in time and didn't need visas to make 2 connections in Europe.

### "Very nice flight"
Bangkok-Amsterdam with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Friendly crew. The food was good with a locally cooked pad thai for lunch. Wine was served, in small bottles, which makes a nice change compared with the wine served straight in plastic glass. You could ask for more, without being given the usual nasty stare. Another meal was served 3hr before landing, nice potato salad with raviolis in tomato sauce. Rounds of drinks were provided during the flight. The IFE was OK. Very nice flight, in a refurbished aircraft. Given the price paid, the flight was excellent.

### "Good value for money"
Flew KLM from Stuttgart to Amsterdam. They were on time, even earlier in Amsterdam, however that time has been consumed by poor airport operations. Good value for money, average seats and meal.

### " ground service at London very poor"
KLM is a very efficient carrier in terms of its online check in and customer service interface. However the ground service at London was very poor, so were its lounges. Check in at Heathrow Terminal 4 was a nightmare. Despite being a Sky Priority member traveling on business class the queue was long. Later I realised there was technical issue with the luggage belt in the business class check in section. No explanation was given and there was no attempt to serve business class passengers using economy class check in. The Skyteam lounge in T4 was also very poor. It is a very boring and dated lounge and the F&B offers weren’t great. It was far inferior to the Plaza Premium lounge on the other side of the airport. It was very disappointing to see a substandard Skyteam lounge considering they have so many flights out of T4. The service inflight is what really makes KLM a reputable airlines. The crew were chatty and extremely friendly. Everyone received a warm welcome – not only for business class passengers. Breakfast served was decent – fresh juice, good quality yoghurt and warm pastry. Returning journey was as good as outbound. Skyteam (KLM) lounge 52 was large but very basic considering its KLM’s hub. It felt like a waiting room in a large train station. Gate at Schiphol was crowded and boarding was late, but ground staff were friendly. Crew in the cabin again was first class and very elegant. Unfortunately my luggage didn’t arrive in Heathrow, perhaps due to the short connection (1 hour) in Schiphol. The queuing system at luggage enquiry wasn’t great but the handling agent was very sympathetic and knowledgeable. I was united with my luggage later in the evening so nothing to complain!

### "crew were very efficient"
Not Verified | Business class return - over night flight. Check in fast with return boarding card offered. DAA lounge ok - flight on time, seats are the same as Y class within more leg space and recline. Business class was full but the crew were very efficient on both legs, friendly, professional, efficient and immaculate presentation. Drinks were flowing and the food for the one hour flight was grilled salmon salad, etc. Bussed to terminal and on the train within 15 minutes. Well impressed with all staff on the ground and air, would use again for sure.

### "the staff is friendly"
Inverness to Zürich via Amsterdam. I always use KLM when I travel in Europe because the staff is friendly, the app is very simple and you get quick notifications when the gate changes or anything else important happens, when my bag got lost, they retrieved it to my house two days later and called me in advance to ask if I am around (luggage can always get lost and is not the fault of the airline). KLM is very professional.

### "a 48 hour nightmare"
We flew as a family of four from Chicago to Cape Town in June 2018, with tickets booked on Delta.com in January. One among our teenage children is a minor. Apparently, we are required to carry a birth certificate for minor children regardless of being on a US passport, to enter South Africa. KLM did not inform us (1) at the time of booking with their Skyteam partner, Delta, on delta.com (2) during online check-in on klm.com and (3) during check-in at O'Hare. Imagine our shock when they did not allow us to board the Amsterdam to Cape Town flight! What followed was a 48 hour nightmare where KLM showed that they did not care about us as customers. Eventually, we did continue our trip after a lot of welcome help from Delta and a lot of personal cost borne by us. The true worth of an airline shows up when things do not go to script. KLM showed that it has neither the technology, nor the process, or the people to operate as a customer-oriented international airline in the 21st century. Shame on you, KLM, for not taking accountability for your deficiencies and for putting us through hell. KLM does not deserve to be on SkyTeam, and in fact should go extinct just like the 747s it continues to fly from US to Amsterdam or its time honored tradition of skimping on meal service.

### "satisfied with the service"
I was booked to fly from Paris to Amsterdam in the evening on KLM, but when I arrived in Paris off another flight, I found out that my flight had been cancelled (maybe due to strikes?). I checked my email and I had already received an email telling me that I had been automatically re-booked onto another flight, which was an awful red-eye overnight journey via Munich - the last thing that I wanted to do after just getting off another 12 hour flight. I went to the Air France/KLM help desk and the kind lady there managed to change my auto-booking to a convenient early morning, direct flight on Air France. She also organised a hotel for the night close to the airport, meal, shuttle and food vouchers, and an amenities kit. The wait time for all this was not too long — maybe less than half an hour — quite good given that there were quite a number of people stuck there. Even though it was quite annoying that I arrived a day late in Amsterdam, I was satisfied with the overall service of Air France/KLM and the way they handled the cancellation.

### "Overall a good experience"
KLM is quite a nice airline to fly - I would recommend them. The check-in at Schiphol airport was very efficient, although the attendant that served me was not friendly. The food on-board was quite good. I ordered a gluten free meal and this was tasty and included a GF bread roll, which is a rare bonus. They also offered me a drink at the same time as they served my special meal, which doesn't usually happen - quite a nice touch. They brought plenty of drinks out throughout the flight. I thought the seat was really comfortable for economy class, with a good head rest, and unusually for me I even managed to sleep for an hour or two. The flight attendants were quite warm and friendly and graciously obliged my requests for extra drinks and snacks. Were were given hot wipes (disposable towels) in the morning before landing. The entertainment was also quite good, with user interface being one of the simplest and easiest to use in my experience, although I think that there is room for improvement with their range of TV shows. The pilots gave several clear updates throughout the flight, which I always appreciate. Plane landed basically on time. Overall a good experience!

### "does not reward you"
Bahrain to Cardiff via Amsterdam. KLM new "revenue" based customer rewards program that does not reward you when you spend more revenue. I fly with KLM on medium haul and short haul flights 8 times a month. When they changed their loyal program earlier this year I kept away from posting anything and waited to see how it would affect me. I am sorry to say that KLM staff on this flight have at best misunderstood the terms and conditions or at worst are purposely misleading customers on the terms and conditions of KLM's new loyalty program. I always upgrade to business class when there are seats available from my economy ticket and more often than not pay full price. On this occasion i paid $900 ontop of my existing ticket to upgrade after confirming with the KLM staff that I would indeed receive the 24XP points in order to retrain my gold status. The flight went well until i noticed that I had only been awarded 8XP points via my KLM app. Upon questioning KLM on this after the flight they informed me that although their system is now revenue based that this "revenue based" program do not recognise this type of revenue based spend?? I am now in the process of changing airlines. 8 x minimum and short haul flights worth of revenue based pending walking our the door for KLM.

### "didn't meet the standard size"
London to Bengaluru via Amsterdam. Terrible service, rude employees, extremely unhelpful. I had 2 small baggage which were under weight limit for check-in but I was charged additional whereas most of the other passengers with huge baggage that didn't meet the standard size were allowed without any additional money being charged. Also the food was really bad, the sandwich was too dry.

### "rebooked flight also cancelled"
London to Amsterdam return. Original outbound flight cancelled due to staff shortages. To make matters worse, my rebooked flight was also cancelled, as was the one afterwards. One angry phone call later, I discovered my rebooked flights had not been cancelled, rather KLM had not entered by booking in to the flight correctly. I was eventually rebooked on to a convenient alternative KLM flight, but lo and behold, on the day I was due to fly, my flight was cancelled. After another angry phone call, I took an pleasant and uneventful BA flight to Amsterdam. Sure enough, my return flight on KLM was cancelled due to technical issues with the plane and my rebooked flight delayed by an hour. To their credit, KLM air crew were very nice and their planes clean. However, the chaos in which KLM seem to operate has put me off flying with them in the future.

### "rude and unhelpful"
Flew KLM from Amsterdam to Nice. Just shocking how rude and unhelpful the airline staff are at the airport. No such thing as customer service. Several times now I have been overly disappointed in the service by this arline and their staff.

### "refused as carry on"
Madrid to Amsterdam. Medical equipment that is essential for me was refused to be allowed as carry on. I showed doctor letters explaining the necessity of the equipment. They threatened to not let me on the plane unless I agreed to let them put it in the hold with other luggage. Eventually this was my only option, with compliance and management contact being refused. This is especially disappointing of an allegedly high class airline.

### "two restrooms for 5 hour flight"
Tel Aviv to San Francisco via Amsterdam. The flight from Tel Aviv to Amsterdam was aircraft Boeing 737. It was a fully packed plane with only two restrooms for 5 hour flight. The aircraft had no entertainment and the two restrooms were not sufficient for the entire economy class section. There were lines constantly for the use of the facility. I don't know why KLM would use such an aircraft for 5 hour trip. On the other hand, the flight from Amsterdam to SFO in Boeing 767 was a totally different experience. The aircraft was much larger and it didn't fill to the capacity so it was much more pleasant flight with less aggravated passengers. Each seat had its individual screen for the entertainment.

### "cabin crew were wonderful"
It was my first time flying with KLM on a non-European flight, the boarding was easy, it's Schipol. The seat was comfortable, the cabin crew were wonderful, the in-flight entertainment was good, could be a little broader but cannot complain. The food though was rubbish, they ran out of beef when they got to me but that isn't the problem it's more the quality of food, they do come round with drinks a lot which is great. Really smooth flight. I've been on an American airline and they're terrible, so it's an overall thumbs up for KLM long haul flights.

### "Overall really impressed"
Manchester to Lima return via Amsterdam, for the first time in KLM's new world business class.The day we flew there was a power outage at Schiphol airport. Fortunately none of our flights were cancelled, though our connecting flight from Manchester  was delayed and gave only us 20 mins in Amsterdam to catch our Lima flight. Staff were extremely good in up-dating the information and honest, saying if we were late the next flight would not wait. Our long-haul experience was fantastic, no delays or luggage issues, the FA's were really friendly and engaging; it was obvious that they took pride in their jobs. The seats are really comfortable and lie flat - on return flight slept for 6 hours. The IFE was current, good resolution and although the screen was fixed never felt I wanted to adjust the screen. Catering was of a high standard and tasty (though not as great variety of choice as offered by middle eastern airlines) and was never left lacking. One the subject of catering, the photos of short-haul sector catering - the chicken salad with accompaniment is what KLM presented on AMS to MAN compared with our BA Club Europe meagre offering of an unappetising  chicken sandwich (GOT to MAN in Feb 2018). Overall really impressed and would not hesitate flying KLM business class long-haul again.

### "is the cheapest ticket"
Bahrain to Kuwait on an A330 in December 2017. On this 1 hr flight, they served juices and waffle. The plane looks old and the crew looked tired which resonates as a gloomy trip. This is the cheapest ticket compare to the legacy and budget airlines flying between this route. Seat pitch is ok. Upon landing, we were stranded in the taxi way due to some other delayed airline blocking our designated gate. Since we were not moving, the air became really hard to breathe in as it smelled like the exhaust from the engine. A female passenger went ill and her children got out of their seats to seek assistance but a crew sitting behind a few rows shouted at them to sit since the plane is still taxiing. Unfortunately, none of the crew who were assisting can speak Arabic. How can an airline send their plane to an Arab country with arabic speaking travelers with cabin crew who do not speak the language? !

### "a pleasure to fly KLM"
Oslo to Amsterdam. I would like to thank KLM for the excellent service offered. Boarding was on time and fast. Nice and very clean Boeing 737 aircraft. The Captain gave a warm welcome message in perfect English. The cabin crew did a professional job and were perfectly groomed and polite. It is a pleasure to fly KLM.

### "Service during the flight was good"
Excellent flight with KLM. I flew from Amsterdam to Mauritius. Besides the little delay (20min) due to a catering problem, we were able to arrive before schedule in Mauritius. Both the cabin and cockpit crew gave us an excellent heads up on the situation. Service during the flight was good, friendly cabin crew who often walked through the cabin with a tray filled with glasses of water and juices during the night. WIFI System in the B787-9 works well, pricing is a bit expensive but the speed was good enough for checking out social media, emails and messages.

### "refused to refund my upgrade"
Birmingham to Entebbe via Amsterdam. Worst service on check in, and after-sales I have ever received from any airline. I took an upgrade to Business class, advertised on the website as allowing cabin baggage of 18kg, and check in of 32kg per bag for 2 pieces. My bags were 27kg each, but they declined to take them. Also they declined to reverse the upgrade. I dropped off valuable excess luggage to fit in 23kg allowance for economy class and travelled economy, but after sales service still refused to refund my upgrade. On the flight, I received no business class service as cabin crew told me it was not pre-booked for me. Very disappointed, I will never use or recommend their airline to anyone again.

### "my second flight canceled"
I had an international flight from Tehran to Los Angeles via Amsterdam, but my second flight canceled. They sent us to Boston for 11 hours stop there and then on United Airlines to LA. I had to carry all my luggage in airport there was no connection flight to carry my luggage. It was awful hospitality during the flight to Los Angeles because we have to send with better flight because our flight was international. Long, and so low class flight with poor condition in airplane. No working the tv front of the chair and so old. I asked for another blanket, they didn’t have extra.

### "my bag was broken and damaged"
Muscat to Luxembourg via Amsterdam. My bag was delayed, they promised me at the airport to deliver it to my residence. Unfortunately, my bag was held at the custom, and only after two weeks of nagging they finally clarified that they can't deliver it and I need to take it personally from Luxembourg custom. Since I live in France, (in Pau, very far away from Luxembourg), I had to travel back to get it. The transportation is already expensive and if the delay didn't happen I would have avoided this problem. So I talked to the costumer service to refund me the transportation and until Now I get rejection. When I got my bag, it was completely broken and damaged but they told me that I could not send a reclamation because I did mot get my bag only after 3 weeks of my flight.

### "a very relaxing mood"
Amsterdam to Birmingham. Since I'm not feeling very comfortable flying I am always searching for more information on internet on how to feel better etc. and I read an article that if you tell the flight attendant when you arrive in the aircraft that you are not feeling confident to fly then they can give you a bit more attention and believe me, it feels much better. I do that each time now but this time was very different as the flight attendant actually directed me to the pilots before take off so that I could ask questions and talk to both (pilot and co-pilot). They asked me at which moment of flying is uncomfortable for me and they gave me some explanations and answered to my questions for 5 minutes. I had no issue after that flying in the aircraft anymore that day. I was really relax and could attend my business meeting on a very relaxing mood too. I felt home! That's why I am choosing for KLM.

### "represented value for money"
Manchester to Los Angeles via Amsterdam. The flight from MAN to AMS was punctual and excellent. I had upgraded to an extra legroom seat for £5 and it was more than worth it. The cabin layout is 3-3 and there was nobody else in my entire row either side! A small breakfast sandwich and hot and cold drinks were served. The cabin crew were excellent. The flight from AMS to LAX left slightly late but arrived bang on time. The cabin crew were wonderful, and my favourite thing about this flight. Last minute at AMS I upgraded to an extra legroom emergency exit seat; it wasn't worth it. The seat was narrow and, frankly, uncomfortable. Two meals were served during the flight, as well as snacks and regular drinks. There was also a self service bar for drinks and snacks; excellent feature. The food and drink were fine. Unfortunately, the IFE didn't work for most of the flight, which was disappointing. Overall, KLM wasn't perfect, but represented value for money and a fairly good product. The cabin crew on both flights were superb.

### "broken head support"
Calgary to Bangalore via Amsterdam. The seat has a broken head support and when I mentioned that there was no help provided. I had to travel a long flight of approx 9 hours without proper head support. Staff are not friendly at all they won’t respond well. I would never prefer this flight until this is my last option. Air Canada is  good with friendly staff and the give the best service in terms of seating and comfort and provide fine food.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Amsterdam to London City. KLM have really got it right on this route and show that short haul can still be pleasant. Charming cabin crew, nice seats and even a snack of a sandwich, biscuit and drink served during the short 45 minute journey. Nothing at all to complain about. I will definitely fly with them again.

### "Very friendly cabin crew"
I was a bit apprehensive as this was my first flight with our young kids, but it went very smoothly. Very friendly cabin crew, and on time arrival both directions for Aberdeen to Amsterdam. The stewardess went out of her way to help us with our infant son. Passport control was not enjoyable on departure from Schipol (extremely long queues at 8.50am) but otherwise a pleasant journey.

### "Horrible service"
KLM is the worst airline I have ever had opportunity to fly with. Horrible service from the beginning to the very end. They lost my son's luggage twice. When missed connecting flight on my way back was forced to pay for a new ticket. I was told that if I decide to fly with another airline (some of them were 3 times cheaper) I would have to pay 200 euro to get my luggage back (for the luggage that was lost anyway). Service on the plane was below any standard. Lady who was serving us obviously had a bad day and she was extremely rude. She was shouting at people. not enough food so never got what I wanted to. When asked for a drink I was told the bar was closed while someone behind me was served by other person.

### "a very enjoyable flight"
Had a nice flight on KLM from Helsinki to Amsterdam. No problems checking in at an automated counter, but in case there were any, a happy looking KLM worker was there in case one needed help. We were boarding on time and although the flight was full, we departed a few minutes early. The crew were polite and funny and made listening to them a joy. On the 2hr flight we were even served a warm meal (Penne Arabiatta), a small dessert (muffin) along with a wide variety of drinks (juices, sodas, wine and beer). Later throughout the flight, the flight attendants came one more time to serve coffe or tea and some water. After a very enjoyable flight we landed in Amsterdam 10min ahead of schedule. It was a very nice economy experience and very worth the price!

### "pleasant and polite cabin crew"
Round Trip, Cracow - Lima via Amsterdam with KLM. Good service, slight 10-15 min slips with the departure, usually communicated and explained. Arrivals always on time. Very pleasant and polite cabin crew. Great job, I was really impressed.

### "KLM is still worth it"
This is the first time I took KLM flight. The trip was from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Passengers were board 10 or 15 minutes late from the initial boarding time. Unfortunately, the flight was delayed for additional one hour due to technical issue. During the flight, stewards were unfriendly at some point. The seats were okay, but it is not comfy enough. The headrest is great and seat recline is surprisingly good. The foods were acceptable. There are many selection of drinks, including alcohol beverages. With the affordable price, KLM is still worth it.

### "put me on standby"
Amsterdam to Toronto. They overbooked the flight that I was meant to be on and put me on standby. The counter staff at the airport were demeaning and condescending as they explained that this is a common practice across airlines. They also refused to put me on an earlier flight. I stayed at the airport in limbo before my flight for 3+ hours before getting a seat on my flight.

### "the worst service"
London to Abu Dhabi via Amsterdam. KLM provides the worst service I have ever experienced in my life. It started at London City Airport where there was only one person dealing with check-in/bag drop-off. Despite the fact I came much earlier I did not manage to drop off my luggage on time. When I asked someone from the staff about my concern I was ensured there was still enough time. When I landed in Abu Dhabi 20 hours later (long transfer) it turned out my luggage was lost. When I talked to the airline it was told it was not loaded in Amsterdam. 2 days later I found out it was not loaded in London. It took them 4 day to get my luggage to be delivered. Another problem with the airline was service on the plane. No food choice. When asked for a drink I was told the bar was closed while someone behind me was served by another person.

### "a very pleasant experience"
London to Bogota via Amsterdam. We had a very pleasant experience flying KLM. Having read the reviews, we did not have high expectations but apart from a mean and uninformed check-in lady, we loved every bit of our flights. Service was very attentive, food was tasty, wine selection was ok (Champagne was dreadful though). Transit in Amsterdam was extremely easy. But what impressed me most was how friendly the crew was and the very comfortable seat, similar to Cathay Pacific and others but much more spacious. Due to late arrival in Amsterdam because of fog our bags did not make it but at Bogotá airport someone was waiting for us with the necessary paperwork already done. A lovely airline I look forward to travel with again.

### "had a very pleasant experience"
Flew Berlin to Tokyo via Amsterdam. I had a very pleasant experience with KLM on my last four flights: Very nice staff. Great IFE with lots of movies in several languages. Good choice of drinks. Small snacks available the whole time in the galley. Decent food even in economy. I will choose KLM again for sure.

### "very good internet service"
I was flying from Gdańsk to Hamburg through Amsterdam. At the beginning, during dropping my luggage ground staff informed me, my plane is overbooked and if I agree to fly with Lufthansa instead of KLM in case everybody check-in at the airport. I agreed. Security control in Gdańsk was terrible nightmare which take me around 40 minutes. At the end somebody didn't came so finally I flied by KLM. Anyway plane was full so they upgrade me to Business class. Food on first leg was much better than in Economy, but worse than in business class in other airlines. Then I had to wait 4 hours in Amsterdam airport for next flight. On the second flight I was able to choose a seat in Economy Comfort area (more space for legs), but service was poor. At the destination my luggage with tools comes completely mixed. Any of the tools wasn't in his place and I wasted around 15 minutes to count them to check if nothing has been stolen. This is unacceptable. Ground staff was very kind and helpful (especially in Gdańsk), cabin crews was also OK. Big advantage of KLM is very good internet service (apps and webpage) where you can find a lot of informations and change a lot of things.

### "no comfortable seats available"
Prague to Moscow (SVO) via Amsterdam. Buy KLM - get Transavia for free. For my trip from Prague to Moscow, March 14th, I had to make a quick stop in Amsterdam and therefore booked KL1356/KL3178 flights. However, before the flight, I got informed that Amsterdam lag will be operated by Transavia. As a consequence, no comfortable seats available. Such a change makes a big difference, given ridiculously small seat pitch at Transavia. If you value a basic level of comfort, you would avoid Transavia. Unfortunately, I was given no choice. During my online check-in at KLM websites I was also invited to “choose seat for free”. Just to learn, such a choice is in fact not available for me, given Moscow lag is operated by Aeroflot. Puzzled, I asked why it cannot be done given both KLM and Aeroflot are members of SkyTeam alliance. I learned that this is due to the fact that the respective systems are not interconnected as yet and "choose your seat" therefore no option. Expression "as yet" sounds real pathetic, given KLM is member of SkyTeam for already 14 years and Aeroflot for 12 years. Management of Sky Alliance must be real preoccupied by other issues if there was no time to implement such a simple feature like seat selection. In a summary, my KLM flight was no KLM flight. And as a SkyTeam ElitePlus customer I was not given a chance to choose my seat.

### "Seriously unpleasant experience"
Amsterdam to Luxembourg. They forced me to stow my small bag under the seat, just because half of the passengers travel with max cabin size luggage. So because I travel light, I am forced impolitely to be kicking my bag. Brilliant logic. The plastic yogurt like cups with water makes you feel like drinking from garbage. Seriously unpleasant experience.

### "It wasn't a personalised service"
Flew Amsterdam to Atlanta. I upgraded to Business Class at check in for a reduced price, but to be honest I wish I hadn't bothered. KLM's Business Class product is inferior to that of other airlines I've flown with (e.g. BA, Emirates, Malaysia, Qatar, Singapore) and worse than it used to be. The amenity kit was terrible and nothing more than you get with some airlines in Economy (socks, eye mask, toothbrush, tiny toothpaste). The food was no better than most economy food I've had. Some flight attendants weren't as friendly as they should be in Business Class, didn't smile much and didn't act like they were happy to serve you. It wasn't a personalised service as it is on Emirates and Qatar. Tip: Save your money and upgrade with another airline instead.

### "typical KLM short haul service"
Amsterdam to Lyon. A one-day return without any checked-in luggage. I checked-in using the KLM app which is easy to use. In Amsterdam I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. Both flights were typical KLM short haul service operated by a KLM Boeing 737-800. On board service consists of a pre-packed sandwich and a drink of choice. The flight was 20 minutes delayed partly due to the late arrival of the aircraft and partly due to air traffic constraints over France. We arrived only 5 minutes late. Less pleasant was the 45min queue in front of the French border police. (Remember that France and The Netherlands are both founding members of the Schengen treaty). During the flight I have been consequently approached in English, even when I returned in Dutch! When returning at Lyon airport I found out there was a power cut at the airport. There was a long queue of passengers who could not be checked in. Security was closed. The Air France ground crew has done all they could fixing the issue and after a while all passengers were moved from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1B where we could pass security and head to a new gate. At the gate the airbridges did not work and all passengers had to embark after a short walk over the tarmac. Boarding was done manually by checking each passenger on a list. At the end we left 30 minutes late. The AF ground staff did a great job, considering there were no computers and no PA systems available. The return flight was operated by KLM Cityhopper EMB 190, a full flight with only 2 enthusiastic flight-attendants. What always strikes me is the difference in attitude between the mainline KLM and Cityhopper crews, when disembarking I was personally greeted by the First officer who checked if I was satisfied with the flight?

### "They even didn't say sorry"
Amsterdam to Malta return. I bought tickets on KLM web site and payed by iDeal. In 10 days before my flight I found out what KLM cancelled my tickets. I have called to their support service and spent 1 hour trying to figure out what was going on. They said what they have lost my payment and cancelled my tickets (without even informing me about it). After 1 hour of not pleasant conversation with their support person they have found my payment somehow and I have finally got my tickets. They even didn't say sorry.

### "Legroom not spacious but okay"
Cityhopper FRA-AMS: On time, enough space for hand luggage. Snack is just cheap junk. Wheat-fat-sugar. You don't have the choice for gluten free or diabetes food. If only they would serve some nuts, that would be better. AMS-CUR was a delight. In time, enough space for hand luggage. Rather good food and the friendliest flight attendant we have ever met, and we had traveled a lot with Malaysia Airlines, who till then were the champions of kindness. Seats a bit narrow but okay. Legroom not spacious but okay. Entertainment mostly boring trivial mainstream or old movies. The earphones are so incredibly bad - from my mother's language I didn't catch 25% of the dialogues, from French (my stepmother's language) and English I understood almost nothing. My husband decided to sleep and gave me his private earphones - that made a huge difference. Screens are very cheap, too. After one film, my eyes hurt and I decided to listen to one of my audiobooks. Arrival in time. After all, a rather smooth traveling experience, in as much as we had been able to catch a very interesting flight tariff.

### "onboard service very kind"
CUR-AMS with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines: Night flight. Started a little bit later but arrived 45 min. before schedule. Ground and onboard service very kind, food was average, but we had brought own provisions, mainly because they are not able to combine at least two food restrictions (for instance low carb and gluten free). Entertainment was poor, earphones same scrap as on the inflight. As I always bring my own comfortable down cushion, I manage to sleep even in Economy seats, so that was no problem. AMS-FRA: Started a bit later, same annoying snack as on the inflight, of course. Waited very long for the luggage, luckily we checked it on the spot, found one of our trunks demolished and reported it to the counter. That went well and was served kindly, now we wait for the refund.

### "been very happy with KLM"
This short KLM cityhopper flight from Amsterdam to Nice was very well organised. Boarding was smooth and the aircraft was very clean. It felt spacious with a 2-2 seating configuration. A snack and a soft drink were served. This was really welcome in these days when most airlines are adapting the low cost approach on short haul flights where you have to purchase everything. Cabin crew was efficient and friendly. So far I've been very happy with KLM.

### "quality has gone downhill"
Amsterdam to Nairobi on B747-400. I have noticed that the level and quality of service of KLM has gone downhill. Small things that used to make the 8,5 hour trip nicer eg the Entertainment screens are old, the entertainment was not working on this trip for the entire way, the food has gone down in quality, less options for Economy class. One really big annoyance is my spouse had to pay for a seat to sit by me. One can see the cutbacks to service and this is not too good. The airline used to have a section for you too hydrate, have a small snack etc - that has disappeared. Unfortunate as I wanted to keep using this like even though it means a stop over in AMS from the USA, but with the new competition from Delta airlines codeshare with Kenyan Airways to begin in late 2018, lets see how KLM does

### "Customer services non existent"
Party of 8 travelling out for long weekend flying from Munich to Newcastle via Amsterdam. They lost all suitcases for 2 days. Customer services non existent in Airport, referred to handling agent, must of been first day on the job as he did not have a clue what he should do! We missed return connection due to crew sickness, which meant a six hour delay. On return we submitted a claim for lost luggage and essentials we had to buy, and a claim for delayed flight. Five months later we are still forwarding emails back and forth. They take up to two weeks to reply to every email and send links that don't work. Customer services are very poor.

### "staff were friendly and respectful"
Upon arrival at the airport, I went to the KLM/Air France counter as I had one piece of luggage to check in. Only one desk was open and no one was at the Sky Priority line. About 20-25 minutes later, the luggage was given and headed to the lounge (different reviews). The boarding of the flight KL1358 started 20 minutes late and we were in the sky about 10 minutes behind schedule so it was quite an efficient boarding process. My seat (1F) was very comfortable with plenty of leg room. As the Embraer 190 has a 2-2 seat configuration even in business, I had someone seated next to me. After the take-off, a dinner was served even with the short flight time. The appetizer consisted of beetroot and apple salad and smoked trout and was delicious for an airline appetizer. The main course was a chicken salad for which was also really good. The flight arrived on time and parked in the gates A, which is the standard one for KLM Connect. We deplaned via the front door and a bus dropped us at the gates C. The staff were friendly and respectful.

### "Late and delayed"
Bordeaux to Trondheim via Amsterdam. Late and delayed for the past three trips. How is it possible that we arrived at the destination two days later than the initial plan. Cheap tickets but they came with cost that we cannot bear. After we get home, I will deactivate and delete our accounts. No more!

### "difference in attitude"
Amsterdam to Oslo. A one-day return without any checked-in luggage. This trip was booked using Flying Blue miles in economy and for both flights seat 11F (exit rows) was selected. I checked-in using the KLM app which is easy to use. In both Amsterdam as well in Oslo I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. Both flights were the typical KLM short haul service consisting of a pre-packed sandwich and a cup of coffee. What always strikes me is the difference in attitude between the mainline KLM and Cityhopper crews. The outbound flight to Oslo was operated by KLM Cityhopper EMB 190, a full flight with only 2 enthusiastic flight-attendants who managed to do 2 drink runs. The return flight was a 80% filled Boeing 737 with one purser and 4 male flight-attendants which were very busy studying their iPads during boarding. These 4 gentlemen just managed to do only one drink run. Both flights left and arrived on time.

### "Appalling customer service"
The worst airline I have ever flown with! They might seem value for money but I would rather pay more as the service I received was appalling. First of all was advised there were no seats for me when I was boarding so had to go back and sit down and wait for another flight which was very inconvient to me! Then I was brought last onto the plane because someone didn't show. We weren't even put on a KLM flight, it was City Jet and was tiny! You just about fitted on the seat, that's how uncomfortable it was. In comparison to it, easyJet seats etc are huge! Then I had to climb over people to get to my seat. There was no room for my bag had to have it on my knee. When I attracted the attention of the flight attendant and asked him to put my bag somewhere he said that I was supposed to tell them if I had a bag. They knew I had a bag because I carried it on the flight. They also walked passed me numerous times and saw it on my knee. Appalling customer service on top of everything else that happened. My feet are now on my bag, the heat is atrocious and the room is ridiculous. I've flown with other airlines and never again would I fly with KLM.

### "efficient, friendly, elegant crew members"
Lucky, unlucky: this month I have flown 3 times with KLM, first to Quito, Ecuador, then to Bali, return from Singapore, definitely not a Cityhopper experience! Despite my Skyteam Platinum status, I have never been upgraded, that’s for the unlucky part but on the three long, demanding flights, I have been surprised by efficient, friendly, elegant crew members! The food also was quite acceptable, and the pitch of the Comfort seat (only Platinum advantage!) as well, although a bit narrow, and I am skinny!

### "pleasant and safe flights"
Flew KLM from Madrid to Oslo via Amsterdam. It is always nice to fly a new B-737-800. The Boarding was fluent and on time. The aircraft was very clean, both outside and inside. Nice and warm welcome when entering the plane. Lots of space for my carry on. Reasonable legroom. Power sockets in every seat. Free in-flight snacks and beverages to all passengers. The KLM Crews were very professional and groomed on both flights. The Captain gave a Dutch and English comfort message. One of the flight attendants gave a nice Spanish message. I felt I had pleasant and safe flights.

### "had a wonderful experience"
I had a wonderful experience with KLM on their Dublin to Amsterdam route. The seats were very comfortable, very wide, and plenty of leg room (even more leg room than I have had on long haul flights with other airlines). Each passenger on board received a complimentary snack and drink. Both members of the cabin crew were very friendly and always had a positive attitude towards the passengers. I would certainly fly with KLM in the future.

### "Very nice staff"
Muscat to Amsterdam. Very nice staff that will always try to help you, and quite comfortable seating. The air conditinning is way too cold though. Are they trying to copy the dutch climate into the cabin? Another small note are the earphones and adaptors they hand out before take-off. They never seem to work properly for me.

### "I had plenty of legroom"
Flew KLM from Amsterdam to Birmingham. Great airline and very friendly staff. The seat is very comfortable and even with my 1.94m I had plenty of legroom. Even though the plane was completely full the attendants had attention for everyone. It was a short flight but they didn't seem rushed at all. Check-in online was easy and fast and because I wanted a boarding pass it was no problem to have it printed out at the airport. The food and drinks are fine too, you get one drink, water and a sandwich, as well as a small stroopwafel. Will fly again next week and I'm looking forward to it!

### "service provided were really good"
Edinburgh to Amsterdam. At Edinburgh airport, quick check-in and security. Boarding on time, departure also on time. Friendly crew. Told them I was not feeling well due to a chronic lung condition (have a FREMEC card). They immediately made aware and made a note. During the flight all went well. I found a diamond ring on the floor in front of me and handed it over to the purser. He checked for the person sitting in that row on the previous flight immediately to make sure that they could give the item back. The flight itself was short. The crew managed service in a breeze, Always friendly and smiling, the purser recognised me from previous flights (I am a flying blue platinum member). After landing and finally at the gate (which at Schiphol can take up to 15 minutes) everyone stood up. The family in front of me was apparently in a hurry, getting out all the hand luggage with a rush, even hitting me on the head, and the placing it even on the seats around them including mine. When walking out of the plane and being at the gate I realised that I left my iPad on my seat. But I was not allowed to go back. They told me that "they will collect it for you" and I had to go to "lost and found". There they told me to fill in an electronic document and within five days they would notify me. Well, after five days I received a message that the iPad had not been found and that they could not help me any further. What a pity, I mean I was less than a fewyards out of the plane and not even half of the passengers had left the plane so I could easily had picked it up. But on the other hand I understand that "rules are rules". Overall, the flight itself and the service provided were really good and that is why I love to fly KLM.

### "unethical and unprofessional"
I purchased 4 tickets online. We were due to fly from LHR to AMS by KLM on 18th January but due to “unfavourable wind conditions” (as notified by KLM), that flight was cancelled and we were subsequently rebooked by KLM on BA. However, when we checked in at LHR T5, we were informed that we had no allowance for checked in baggage, despite having purchased such allowance for 2 pieces at the time of purchase of our tickets. As a consequence, I had to repurchase baggage allowance. I subsequently emailed both KLM and the travel agency through which I purchased our tickets to have my baggage allowance refunded. However, despite my persistence and an exchange of emails, I have been told by KLM to claim my refund from the travel agency, whilst that travel agency told me to claim from KLM! It is obvious that either one is lying! I am very disappointed to say the least. I have been fobbed off by both KLM and the travel agency, both of which deny their responsibility to a paying customer. I expected much better from KLM, a supposedly reputable premier airline. But KLM is unethical and unprofessional, ignoring my latest email.

### "read the terms and conditions"
We booked KLM flights together from Malaga to Panama (via Amsterdam). We paid 1487.76 euros for the two tickets. Unfortunately I could not get back to Malaga in time to check in, so decided to go straight to Amsterdam and meet my partner there to catch the next leg of the flight. My partner  checked in at Malaga as planned and informed the representative at the check in counter that I couldn't get back to Malaga so was going to meet her in Amsterdam. My partner asked if the rep could arrange for our seats to be together for the Amsterdam to Panama flight. The rep advised it was best to both check in again together at Amsterdam. Once at Amsterdam check in desk the representative advised there is a problem and they need to go to the ticket desk. The ticket desk assistant tells me I will have to pay a 500 euro 'penalty' for missing the first flight. Even though I felt like he was being held to ransom I had little choice but to pay the 500 euro 'penalty' if I wanted to continue on the holiday. It took the ticket desk assistant at Amsterdam 10 minutes to carry out some admin and issue a new ticket. How can KLM justify 500 euros for this? It wasn't like we just 'no showed'. My partner checked in as scheduled and informed KLM at the check in desk at Malaga the situation. Why was nothing about penalties mentioned then? So disappointed at KLM's 'computer says no' attitude and their failure to see the customers point of view. Companies that hide behind t's & c's can not be trusted in my opinion. It's easy to be smiley and helpful when things are running to plan, it takes a real customer focused company to actually look into customers problems and come up with win win solutions. If you're flying KLM make sure you read the terms and conditions and don't expect any help if things go wrong.

### "attendants  courteous and professional"
Manila to Amsterdam. Had a pleasant flight. Plane left Manila on time and we had a 2 hour technical stop in Taipei. Aircraft was clean and the seats were comfortable although the pillow was quite small and thin. Food was delicious and filling and flight attendants were courteous and professional.

### "provide a dollar store ear plug"
Los Angeles to Amsterdam on Boeing 747-400. Entertainment is a joke, no good collection, no touch screen and they provide a dollar store ear plug and not head phone. The staff are so resistant about serving you an extra drink if you ask one. During boarding the plane, one  person said I have redo checkin as the machine seems to be not recognizing my boarding pass, when I went to get it redone the other person after standing in line again said it’s already checked in. The overhead had no space for my luggage.

### "plane was dirty and old"
I travel a lot with work and this was my first time with KLM flying from Milan to Billund via Amsterdam. Never have I experienced such a bad airline. Not on time, unprofessional staff and just poor in general. The plane was dirty and old. They were 55 minutes delayed on my flight with no explanation and no help to make my connection flight.

### "These were amazing attendants"
Amsterdam to Minneapolis-St. Paul. My son and I were on this flight, coming home from a 17 day, four country European vacation. We were quite tired from staying up the entire night before watching the Minnesota Vikings play ina championship game. When he sleeps, my son wears an expensive, custom-made mouth guard to prevent teeth grinding. Meals were served on the flight, and when he woke he put his mouthguard on the tray and forgot about it. Yep - he then handed the tray to a flight attendant and didnt think about the mouth guard for about 1/2 hour. He ran to the back and explained his predicament. The attendant we thought had taken his tray said he would check the trays. We were not feeling optimitistic, and also felt bad to be putting them to this work. He came to our seats later and said it wasnt in any of his trays. This was the answer we expected. We thanked him for his time and considered it a costly mistake. About an hour later, this gentleman came back and asked my son to come to the back. The attendants went through every single tray and found it! These were amazing attendants and fantastic trhoughout the flight, which ended up having to be rerouted to Detroit at the last minute due to snowstorms in Minneapolis. A huge thank you to KLM and this anazing crew! I wish we had been able to thank you more personally on the flight.

### "seat change outrageous"
Evening flights Zurich to Bucharest via Amsterdam with KLM on Boeing 737-900 each. I am Flying Blue Platinum For Life member, so having the highest status you can get with AF and KL. I had at check-in seat 7D on the first leg. Shortly before boarding I was called with a few other passengers to the gate manager, being informed that our seats have been changed. The gentleman right before me to 7F, me to 29D although he had no connection and even though the flight was delayed about 40 minutes. As reason I was told that the plane (originally B737-800) had been changed to a smaller airplane. That happens and I understand. But when boarding the aircraft was a bigger B737-900 - making my seat change outrageous unacceptable! I was telling this to a crew member in the back of the plane and she saved the situation, organizing me seat 3D. What a great crew also later during service! On the other hand, I do not understand and accept the decisions of the station management in Zurich. It's dangerous to gamble with the loyalty of the top tier frequent flyer members. There is a vast choice for flights all over the globe and as frequent flyer I am able to make my choice! Either I get my tiers privileges or not and then I not booking anymore. So a my big gratitude and thank to the crew. The flights themselves were eventless and I arrived just 25 minutes late in OTP.

### "thanks for good flights"
Flew out of Copenhagen, 6am on KL1124. Spent the day in transfer in Amsterdam. Came back to Schiphol at night to fly KL461 to Tel Aviv. Economy class both flights. Efficient all the way. On time departures. Early arrivals. Both flights fully booked. Good cabin service from great staff. Served vegetarian meal on Tel Aviv flight: very good indeed. No inflight entertainment on neither flights, not a problem for me. Have flown KLM before and will do again. Only annoying thing is fellow passengers with lots of hand luggage in cabin. One passenger got very aggressive with one crew member who needed to call the captain to get things calmed down. Problem was that the passenger was carrying too much hand luggage into the cabin. Airlines need to be strict on the rules. But I compliment the female hostess skills in handling the very rude and emotionally hysterical male passenger. Good on you KLM, thanks for good flights.

### "never offered any apology or a hotel"
We booked a flight with KLM for our child using the Chaperone service, may I advise anyone not to do this. It cost us an extra £92 on top of the flight which was already more expensive than other airlines. The flight was due to land at Leeds at just after 10pm. However the flight took off and then due to a technical issue had to return to Amsterdam. This is ok but no-one informed us of this, then after waiting we heard the flight the cancelled. Again no one called to say our son was safe, the chaperone we heard took our son to the KLM lounge and left him there with the lounge staff, neither the chaperone or the lounge staff thought to use the big folder around the child's neck to call the parents. Therefore we were running around Leeds trying to find out what was going on. We had called family in Amsterdam whom had return to the airport to see what was going on there also but no-one knew. Eventually at 01.30 we tracked him down to the KLM lounge. KLM never offered any apology or a hotel as thy are supposed to. Why didn't the chaperone or lounge staff call us. To me this is nothing more than neglect. KLM took 2 weeks to answer my email of complaint and then took 2 more to come back with an offer of the flight payment up to £250 plus £92 for the service and £100 family day if we paid for it first and sent them the receipt. The way they have been with us I am not sure they would do this so wouldn't spend that extra money on the off chance. I believe this is totally unacceptable as we are entitled by eu law for the flight money back so they for company like this to offer a £100 voucher for child neglect just goes to show how much emphasis they put on childrens well being. I suggest you never use this service from this airline as this is totally unacceptable.

### "staff are not even paying attention"
Los Angeles to Amsterdam. Jan 18, 2018. I am sitting on my seat in flight KL0602 departing for AMS from LAX and I don't need a minute longer to wait to give a review based on my experience so far. I literally had to yell at two people who were forcefully trying to fit their bags over my laptop in the overhead compartment. After the third person attempting the same thing I had to pull my laptop out. This is ridiculous the staff are not even paying attention.

### "high and consistent standard"
Flew Oslo to Frankfurt via Amsterdam. Four KLM intra-European flights in three days, all of the same high and consistent standard. On time, good legroom, decent snacks (especially the typical Dutch cheese-sandwich), very good choice of drinks. Best of all was the crew spirit! Cabin crew were charming on each and every flight, no matter how full the aircraft was. On one flight even the pilot came out of his cockpit and made his pre-departure announcement whilst standing in front of the guests giving the whole flight a personal touch. For this high service level I am absolutely willing to pay the extra Euro compared to no-frill-carriers.

### "The crew was nice"
Amsterdam to Oslo. Really good service overall, the boarding was fast and easy, we got direct connection to terminal even though we were flying a small plane (Embraer 190). The crew was nice, the flight was on time and seats were comfortable. Just a little bit expensive.

### "great experience with KLM"
Rome to Amsterdam. I had a great experience with KLM . Good value for money, fast and efficient ground service, kind and friendly staff and very tasty food served with the typical Dutch products. Looking forward to flying with them soon again.

### "KLM has a lot to catch up on"
Amsterdam to Cape Town. After a rushed flight from Nice to Amsterdam we were left with only 45 minutes, but I  wanted to have a freshen-up in the lounge. The airport is chaotic, but the KLM lounge was worse. I have never seen so many people in such a crowded space. You can’t find any decent seats and then there isn’t any space between chairs. After a quick coffee and a toilet break we left for the boarding gate. Well, even worse - there is a long queue for passport control. When we got to the gate it was already boarding time. The 777 was ok. Slightly angled seats with a tiny tiny foothold. I am 5.6 and my feet barely fit in it. When flat the bed is comfy but one has to angle ones feet sideways. The blanket is soft and warm. Service was very efficient but at times I couldn’t find any staff. Since it was a daylight flight I had to watch TV and eat. Food wasn’t great - beef curry was a reconstituted shredded beef without any flavour. The other choices were worse. Drinks were good. The pre-arrival snack was a dec3nt hamburger but it was cold. The amenity kit was poor - worse than most economy class. Just a pair of sock, toothbrush and toothpaste. And an eyeshade. We had a 1.5 hour delay due to a technical issue, which is not the airline’s fault, but still, they didn’t give us any drinks or snacks until after an hour. All in all, KLM has a lot to catch up on, even just within its group, to Air Feance’s standard. We flew AF in March, also business class, and it is a much superior airline. The French has a flair for service and food, while the Dutch has efficiency. Well, in this competitive age of world travels, I’m afraid efficiency is not enough to woo customers back.

### "luggage did not make it"
Accra to Geneva via Amsterdam. As I boarded flight from Amsterdam to Geneva, yesterday, 9 January, I was informed by the flight attendant that my baggage may not make it Geneva and will arrive on the next flight. The luggage did not make it on my flight, nor the next. As I write at 15:17 pm, 10 January, I have not received my baggage. The airline should improve on its customer service and contract a more efficient courier company to handle baggage delays.

### "will not recommend to anyone"
Amsterdam to Vancouver. This airline and customer care centre has been nothing but a whirlwind and they do not have a customer care centre. I have been writing and phoning and waiting since October 9th 2017 for my case to be sorted out and it is now January 9th 2018. When I landed from Amsterdam to Vancouver part of my bag was missing and I went straight away to KLM desk they told me I need make police report at airport soo I did then KLM said I need to call customer care but every  time I call there is no way to get real person to talk to in customer care and I wrote emails after emails when someone finally calls me they say u need feel out this and that form but I already did, it's like they just put me though to someone else. I finally got someone to handle the case and they said the case is closed and we will send you a cheque for your lost items. That was at beginning of November and it's now January and when I call or write they say the cheque it's in mail. But it's in the mail from November 10th to January 9th to me this don't make sense and the customer service from KLM Delta has been the worst in my life. I will not recommend this to anyone.

### "did not offer an alternative flight"
Terrible service. Long haul flight from London to Taipei was cancelled the day before. KLM made no attempt to notify me or transfer me to another flight. No refund was given as they claimed that it "was not their fault'. Was forced to book a different flight to Taipei out of my own pocket because KLM did not offer an alternative flight.

### "I was very impressed"
Singapore to Denpasar. I had not flown KLM for many years but given the low fare cost for a return trip to Bali from Singapore for business class tickets it was a deal to good to miss. Admittedly the flight originated in Amsterdam so there was always the chance the arriving flight would be late. This proved to be the case and we left Singapore almost forty minutes late. The configuration of two seats by three per row (thirty seats per cabin) is ideal and there is plenty of leg room and the seats very comfortable. Despite being a flight of little over two hours the well trained and friendly cabin crew managed to serve a tasty full meal with all the complimentary drinks on offer. All in all I was very impressed and the overall cleanliness of the cabin was most pleasing.

### "Very poor customer care"
Kilimanjaro to Birmingham via Amsterdam. It is a nightmare to contact and speak to a human being with KLM - almost impossible. I lost my baggage since a month. They sent me back an email to contact back KLM, but nobody picks up the phone for many minutes, often it goes dead. They have all glossy Social Media on the website, but you only receive standard replies - nothing useful, no one cares. UK Customer Care do not care for anyone calling as they do not pick-up the phone - simple. Next time you book the flights, just dial the number and experience yourself. Use those airline, who will care for you in case of any un-certainty. KLM is not one of them as per my experience. I am a regular traveler and experiencing the poorest response from a giant airline on lost baggage. Very poor customer care.

### "Cabin crew were very polite"
Amsterdam to Athens, it was a pretty good flight but the touchdown was hard. Cabin crew were very polite and very helpful with every passengers request. Dinner (pasta with pesto) wasn't very tasty but it was just OK. The last 1 hour of the flight water had run out, that was a problem but it was ok because they had other drinks. Legroom was OK but not big. I recommend KLM, it was very good.

### "Worst flight ever"
New York to Geneva via Amsterdam. Worst flight ever. We booked seats in advance for more space at exit. KLM agent did not mention my seat was in front of exit. Therefore no gain. The food on KLM is the worst I had. Headphones given could not deliver stereo. A passenger vomited. He tried to reach the toilets but couldn’t make it. However, we tried to reach attendant during 10 Minutes until he realized we were searching for them. And another 7 Minutes to decide how to clean, unbelievable.

### "Watch out if you pay for an upgrade"
Dammam to Amsterdam. Watch out if you pay for an upgrade and are unlucky enough to either get downgraded or have a cancelled flights. You may find yourself in a position of receiving a email or notice on KLM's app that you can upgrade to a economy comfort or business class seat for anything between 50 Euros to 500 Euros. A word of warning if you do. 1- If you upgrade from your original seat and pay between 50 Euros to 500 Euros for the upgrade and then have your flight cancelled KLM will rebook your flights back to the original seat class only with no automatic refund on your upgrade. You have to go through a 2 week refund process which you have to initiate by applying for first with no guarantee of a refund at the end! You will be told "the reason we could not rebook your upgraded seat is because these are not available on your rebooked flight". But when I logged on to KLM's website or App I notice that the upgraded seats are still available. Only this time they are substantially more expensive to upgrade to, because they know that there are more people willing to upgrade because of the cancelled flights. If like me you check the upgrade as soon as you get your ticket and find the highest upgrade available is a economy comfort seat and you pay for that upgrade as soon as you can you may find yourself in a sticky situation if business class becomes available closer to departure time and you upgrade further. Because, and I quote a customer services rep on the phone "It is KLM's policy not to refund any earlier upgrade to economy comfort if you then upgrade to business class". KLM has already failed to honour your original upgrade from the day before, failed to give you a automatic refund and will keep your money for 14 days and then hiked the price of that upgrade to around $100 more for the same flight the next day. And now are refusing to give a refund for a lesser upgrade booked earlier which has been superseded by paying the premium price for business class upgrade. All in all KLM are  not customer focused and are only focused on your money, making it easy for you to hand over and hard for you to get back if anything goes wrong. Whilst flying out of Dammam we have had our flight delayed (above flight) due to fog, we watched as all the other airlines gave their passengers information, hotel, transport as it was very clear that we would not be leaving that night. It took KLM 15 hours to get their passengers out of the airport, and still we were not given any information. We were told by the KLM business lounge rep " I will cancel your exit stamp and you can go and sort yourself out until the next flight". And with that we were escorted through passport control which took 2 hours and dumped back in the departures area of the airport, landslide.

### "Very pleasant flight"
Very pleasant flight. The crew were fantastic, they gave you a hot meal and a beverage/wine/beer for you to choose from even though the flight was only 2 hours long. They checked our hand bags for free since it was winter and there was minimum space it was likely that we would have to check them upon boarding.

### "not able to check online"
Kuwait to Toronto return via Amsterdam. In July 2017 I found a good deal with KLM and went for it. I was not able to check online and get my free preferred aisle seat. My luggage was not delivered in Toronto. I received it 24hrs later with items broken. Amsterdam to Toronto flight entertainment system was broken in the whole plane. Every time I called the call center I was on hold for approximately 1 hour. When I emailed them with my complaint about check in I received a reply after 3 weeks stating  "please ask one of our agent at the check in counter to help you". Today is my flight from Toronto back to Kuwait and I was not able to check in online again, receiving this message "unfortunately, you can not check in with this booking. please check in at the airport desk". Called the customer service and after 1 hour hold this was their answer "sorry, we dont know why this is happening, please check in at the airport.

### "very polite staff"
Gdańsk to Nuremberg via Amsterdam. One of my favourite airlines. Stable product with very polite staff in my opinion. Rich service on european regional routes including alcoholic beverages. There could be alternative for sandwiches if somebody does not prefer. Large legroom is another advantage of KLM. Nice airport in AMS. Subtracted a point due to overbooking that is practiced by this airline.

### "worth the upgrade cost"
I was pleasantly surprised by KLM. The premium economy seat was worth the upgrade cost. The meals were better than average, too. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient. We were delayed by weather, but the Captain made up the time. The extra legroom was nice, too. In flight entertainment was fine. All in all, it was a good flight from Vancouver to Amsterdam via Edmonton.

### "failure when it comes to lost baggage"
Kilimanjaro to Birmingham via Amsterdam. Overall a good airline, but complete failure when it comes to lost baggage, delays etc. KLM has failed to return my lost luggage almost a month now. I travelled from Tanzania to Birmingham on the 9th December. Bag was lost due to snow delays from snow. But KLM fails to bring it back, it is almost a month. KLM dealing at Amsterdam during snow delays was very poor with an waiting time in the queue reaching 90 minutes.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
Amsterdam to San Francisco. Its my worst flying experience so far. We were travelling with my 1 year old daughter. The staff was extremely rude. They were never ready to go out of their way to help. When one of their air hostess was roaming around with a tray with juice, on asking which juice it was, she replied - "I have only 2 hands and I am carrying the tray". This was  rude and uncalled for. The food was substandard, and I paid for their wifi but the wifi just did not work and I lost my money. When my baby was playing with toys and making a bit of noise - the air hostess was making faces at the baby. They did not even have good baby food. I am extremely disappointed with my experience and would never fly KLM again.

### "definitely fly KLM again"
Manchester to Seoul via Amsterdam. First time flying KLM, had high expectations. All flights departed and landed on timee. Flight from MAN-AMS was very short, we were served a free snack and a free drink. Amsterdam to Seoul was less bearable. The Boeing 747 is very old and cramped, IFE is outdated and there are no USB sockets. The seat controls are kept in the arm rest and every time I leaned that way while trying to sleep I would accidentally lean onto the buttons and turn either the overhead light or the IFE on. Food was edible, wasn't really expecting much from economy. We were served dinner first, and the Korean option was available, then breakfast was served before landing. The FA's were amazing, very attentive, always refilling drinks without being called on. I would definitely fly KLM again, so long as the route wasn't operated by one of their 747's.

### "Bad horrible experience"
London to Dresden via Amsterdam. Bad horrible experience with rude unprofessional staff. I flew yesterday with my 2 little children. First the plane was delayed over an hour and 15 mins from London,  the next plane from Amsterdam to Dresden I had 20 mins to run with my little ones in such a big airport. No one helped and the staff very rude and we didn't get any assistance. Really upset about it. We arrived to out final destination, the bags didn't arrive. Waiting then I asked been told they will be delivered the next day evening. 3 bags lost calling every 10 mins, the airline seems to talk to the wall, they don't know any thing. Still waiting until now didn't get my bags.

### "rude, unprofessional and unhelpful"
Amsterdam to Bergen. KLM lost our bags at Amsterdam and have failed to return them us. The bags got into the airport (20 minutes from our hotel) last night and 24 hours later still have not arrived at our hotel. We have been calling KLM every 10 minutes since 8am this morning and every time we get a new person and they tell us there’s nothing they can do. We leave on a 12-day cruise in an hour with only the clothes on our backs. Every time we call KLM they just tell us to go out and buy more clothes. No sympathy or apologies. And it’s not that simple. We have suitcases full of expensive snow gear for our winter getaway. We can’t replace it easily. And by now the shops are shut where we are and we can’t even get more underwear. Every person at KLM has been rude, unprofessional and unhelpful. I would never fly with this company again. Outrageous service. On top of that Ethihad/KLM lost our gluten free order for food and we went for 27 hours without food on our flights from Melbourne. I don’t know who is running these airlines but they have not got it together.

### "My last trip was uneventful"
As a frequent flyer I do a lot of hops on different airlines both within Europe and intercontinentally, and can say that the best option in Europe is now KLM due to their extensive network, frequencies and good hub in Schiphol. My last trip was uneventful. I was able to purchase comfort seats online, I was able to do mobile check in via app, mobile boarding passes worked, and I had no delay at any point at all airports of my travel. Check in desks in Kiev and Dusseldorf are well staffed and provide a very smooth and competent treatment. Onboard it was all right. Clean cabins, clean toilets, cheerful staff and smart snack concept including bar service. Somehow there was no battle over overhead luggage space despite full flights. Flights out were bang on time. Flights back both delayed by 50 min due to snow, but with excellent communication from the gate staff and then from the crew. Announcements onboard about connection gates and delays are much appreciated. Overall I had around 40 flights with AirFrance/KLM within last 12 months, and can say that at any case including flight cancellations I got very responsible and reasonable treatment. Highly recommended. P.S. I paid just 150 USD for roundtrip, so great value. P.P.S. Due to constant rush in Amsterdam only bus gates both ways for both Schengen and non-Schengen flights. Not convenient in bad weather.

### "Never fly this airline again"
Amsterdam to Nairobi. Took my carry on bag promising a dozen times that the bag would be waiting for me at the door of the airplane when I arrived in Nairobi. I told them several times that my bag would be stolen or lost and please do not take it, that I was allowed my carry on. But they refused to let me on without it. Got to Nairobi, the man outside the door of the plane yelled at me when I asked very politely for my bag. I explained I was told it would be at the door. I was yelled at again and told to pick it up with the rest of my bags. Three hours of waiting for that bag and of course no bag. We had to delay our trip to go to back to the airport the next day to search for it again. When it was retrieved of course things were missing from my bag. Never will fly this airline again.

### "always felt well taken care of"
Tokyo to Berlin via Amsterdam, and had an excellent experience. Though the first flight had a delay and we hardly arrived on time at the connecting flight to Amsterdam, the ground staff reopened the gate and let us in. At Amsterdam Schiphol airport there was bad weather so there were a lot of passengers coming late. Unfortunately our baggage did not make it in time which I totally understand considering the circumstance of a connecting time below 20 min. When we arrived in Tokyo Narita the ground staff already prepared a baggage loss claim form with our names on it and informed us that the baggage will probably arrive the next day but latest the day after the next day. So we went shopping to get some necessary clothes for the next day, assuming that the baggage will arrive soon. I got e-mails, facebook, whatsapp and sms notifications that the baggage is already on the flight to Tokyo-Narita. The next I called the ground staff to ask for any news and they could not say anything specific, but called back a few hours later to inform us, that our baggage will arrive in the evening between 5 and 10 pm at the place in Tokyo, where we stayed. About half past 6 the baggage arrived. Excellent. Then I filled in the compensation form for the clothes I had to buy, and got a response within 2 days that the total cost of about 110 EUR will be refunded within 2-3 weeks. With Etihad I am still waiting after more than 1 month for any response for the reimbursement after I had a flight cancellation with a nightmare experience. With KLM I  felt that all the people are very concerned about any detail that is relevant for the passenger experience. Problems always arise at some point but how an airline company deals with it, makes a difference. From a passenger perspective, I really don't know, what they could have done better. The ticket price was also very competitive, especially considering that I booked 2 days in advance. It was the second inexpensive option and the connection with the shortest travel time. So value for money was really excellent! So if KLM offers a competitive price I would always this airline to an alternative. The service quality was remarkable and I always felt well taken care of.

### "never again with KLM"
I'm studying abroad in Holland and won a scholarship from school which paid for my round trip from LAX to AMS and back. I left in early August and now sitting at the airport waiting to go back to LAX (now December 18). Come to my surprise that KLM has cancelled my flight because they listed me as a no-show on my flight from LAX to AMS. My question is: the how do you think I got here? Anyhow, I arrived 3 hours early and I still did not make my plan flight and now KLM has to buy me another ticket out. The worst part is the service. I'm not one to complain and make a scene. I know mistakes happen but a smile goes a long way especially for a customer who's patient. But anyways KLM did purchase me a new flight and that's it. I got nothing else from it. So basically never again with KLM or Delta because apparently they can't keep track of the passengers or give decent service.

### "Very bad experience"
Amsterdam to JFK New York. Very bad experience - in snowy conditions, but not honest updates. The aircraft had 5 hours (or longer) delay. They did manage to fly us from Amsterdam to New York - no extra treats to say thank you. At the landing - 10 minutes before touch down), the crew made an announcement that they had not taken our luggage and that we would get info at the gate. The info was a little card with a phone number to call -delta (my airline / code share). The person at the phone told me that she could not help me and that I needed to file claim with klm. I filed claim online - very long process at the end of which I got the standard legal disclaimer (that the airline took no responsibility what so ever). I spent another hour trying to talk to a person, was directed to delta baggage who were polite and helpful - gave me reference number and phone number.

### "didn't manage to provide any support"
Flew Copenhagen to Amsterdam. Good if nothing bad happens. Overall KLM offers a good service and has a great flight network. However, as soon as something goes wrong, don't count on this airline. I have now experienced it for the second time that a flight has been cancelled due to bad weather conditions and KLM just did not manage to provide any support. There is a busy hotline and the fact that you may miss your original connection once bad weather hits is totally understandable. The way how KLM reacts to this, however, is incredibly bad. In both cases, the airline sent an e-mail telling us that they would contact us within the next three hours, but in fact, they never (not even after two days) write or call back. You cannot reach the hotline (you get disconnected after one hour of waiting) or their Whatsapp support. When I tried to re-book online (which they offer for free under these conditions and advice you to do in their cancellation e-mail), the online-system aborts the re-booking process and displays a random error message. What worked for me last time is to book a flight with another airline and ask for a ticket refund at KLM. In sum, the airline just dumped me and didn't manage to provide any support. I would therefore not recommend this airline if you fly via Schiphol (frequently strong winds and flight cancellations) or you need support after something goes wrong.

### "Very bad experience"
Helsinki to Barcelona via Amsterdam. First the flight was delayed 1:30h and when we arrived to Barcelona they send sms that they are sorry but the baby stroller will be delayed, and it came to us the next day, so the ruined our first day of our vacation. In the return flight at the airport they said the airplane is full so the forced us to put our handbags which contains all of our important things in luggage, and they did it again and send a (sorry sms) that the bag (which contains the car and home keys) will be delayed.. We live in another town, we had to stay in our friend's house until 6pm the next day,  and more they dont have 24/7 customer service so anyone would help in such cases. Very bad experience.

### "The service was impeccable"
Amsterdam to Bangkok. The New Business Class service project is tested on this route. Dine anytime you want, personal service, no use of trolleys. The service was impeccable, food was perfect and the crew warm and welcoming. A great uneventful flight with excellent catering.

### "high price for luggage"
Amsterdam to Rome. It was a long time ago since I flew KLM, mainly because of the price: KLM always turns out to be more expensive than other airlines. This time it was slightly more expensive than Alitalia, but since I was looking for a reliable airline -and not an insolvent one like Alitalia or Air Berlin, or an unreliable airline which cancels thousands of flights like Ryanair- I booked KLM. And I wasn't disappointed: smooth online check-in, super fast luggage drop-off at both airports, very friendly crew, rather good legroom, a decent snack and a drink, smooth flight and punctual arrival.. Just great. The only downside: the high price for luggage. I paid 100 euros for two bags. That's way too much, especially if you have a look at the big suitcases brought on board. If i only had known. KLM should really be more strict with hand luggage. Otherwise: would definitely fly again.

### "very friendly and helpful"
Amsterdam to Cape Town via Amsterdam. I would highly recommend KLM to anyone The food was amazing and the flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. Every connecting flight was on on time. Smooth takeoff and landing.

### "cabin service excellent"
Hamburg to Manchester via Amsterdam, cabin service excellent and connection in Amsterdam excellent (45mins). Aircraft and seat comfort is excellent. I think KLM exceed most European airlines in short haul and the product is excellent. I will definitely fly KLM in the future.

### "unprofessional and unacceptable"
Singapore to Munich via Amsterdam. I am really disappointed about yesterdays behaviour of KLM. I was supposed to fly out from Singapore at 1:30 on December 1st. On November 30st around 7pm, so just a few hours before the flight I checked my e-mail (I was lucky because I checked them already a few hours before and didn’t see any KLM e-mail) and saw a mail by KLM saying that my flight has been cancelled and that I have been booked on a flight at 1.35pm on December 1st! So what? Is this even legal? My husband (booked on the same flight) called KLM and because we had to be home within noon on December 1st, they booked us on a Emirates flight via Dubai on 9pm on November 30st. We almost didn’t make it to the check in, couldn’t get seats next to each other anymore. So how is this working: they just send a mail, hoping people are just accepting the change? How about plans, unbooked hotels etc - if I hadn’t checked my mails, where we supposed to sleep on the airport? How about plans when getting home? This is completely unprofessional and unacceptable!

### "Never again with KLM"
Warsaw to Accra via Amsterdam. The plane from Warsaw was late so I had to hurry up to catch my flight to Ghana in Amsterdam. Very short time for transfer. During boarding to Accra I told the staff that its very important to fly with my luggage and asked them to reassure its packed to the plane. They replied me they would do it for me. I boarded the plane with trusting them. They delayed my luggage (4 bags 23 kg each). I did not know when I would get it back so had to book the hotel in Accra instead of going by the car directly to Kumasi after landing. I went to Ghana during my time off from work. Delaying my luggage ruined my trip! The third day I had to buy some aids to be able to start my work with kids. Meantime I had to struggle with organizing picking my luggage up from the airport as I was in Kumasi when it finally arrived. They did not organized delivery to Kumasi. I involve few people to help me with my challenge. They called the airport every few hours, they were looking for somebody we can trust to pick my luggage up. I paid for the man who came at the airport to do that instead of me, he passed the bags to the bus to Kumasi, I also paid for the taxi to the place I stayed near Kumasi. Etc. I had to buy items like clothes, shoes, cosmetics, drops, etc. I had to buy to use as I landed just in pair of jeans, trainers and jacket. I did not know when my luggage would be with me. I wrote a letter of complaint to KLM. Attached about 10 invoices for the items I had to buy. KLM replied me after one week. They decide to pay me only 100 EUR compensation. For delaying 4 bags! I had to organize by myself picking the bags up and delivery to different city and paid a lot for that. I did not agree with their decision. But they are not going to change their mind. Its very sad and unfair how they treated me in a very challenging situation. No empathy. No sense of responsibility. I learnt the lesson. Never again with KLM!

### "problem was with AirBaltic"
Birmingham to Tallin via Amsterdam. The first leg of the trip from Birmingham to Amsterdam, which was on KLM's own plane, was fine. However, the second leg of the journey, from Amsterdam to Tallinn, which was on AirBaltic and was dreadful. Staff were miserable. On the two hour flight, from Amsterdam to Tallinn, they did not even offer a glass of water free of charge. On the 55 minute flight, from Birmingham to Amsterdam, we were well looked after. The AirBaltic aircraft was old, noisy and cold too. Next time, I will find another route to Tallinn, just to avoid AirBaltic. No complaint about the service on KLM's own planes. The problem was with AirBaltic that KLM use for their passengers from Amsterdam to Tallinn.

### "recommend this 4 Star airline"
Bangkok to Hamburg via Amsterdam. Online check in very easy and convenience. KLM ground staff at BKK very nice and helpful/Baggage drop of very quick and efficient. Boeing 777-300ER took off punctually, cabin very clean but flight 100% full and 10 seats/row very cramp and uncomfortable. Flew KLM in 2013 and noted that 4 years later in 2017 KLM new Y seat of B777-300ER is narrower than the seats of 2013 and there was no footrest anymore which makes the long range travel less comfortable. But new excellent IFE with more choices of music and movies in several languages. Cabin crews were aged but very friendly, professional and enthusiasm throughout the flight. One hour after taken off hot towel was given before serving lunch. Quantity and quality of lunch in 2017 was average of Y class standard. After lunch duty free sales with great selections at attractive price (cheaper than Airport Bangkok). Unlike other airlines after lunch and duty free sale most of crews were still on duty and came often with soft drinks and ice cream during the rest time. Before landing at AMS we got 1 cold meal. After landing KLM crews still on “enthusiasm service” helping passengers took out the cabin baggage/ saying thank you and goodbye with smiles. Negative points compare with 2013 is narrow seat and food/beverage. In 2017 we got only 1 hot meal (lunch) and 1 cold meal (snack) for 12 hours flight compared with 2 hot meals (Lunch & Dinner) in 2013 but KLM’s enthusiasm cabin crews made these 2 negative points quit. Transit at Amsterdam is easy and convenience as always. On AMS-HAM short leg with better service than other European airlines. KLM served sandwich and full drinks including beer and wine on this short leg. All in all best value for money and KLM’s Y-class is beside Air France one of the best Y class of European airlines. I would recommend this 4 Star airline.

### "satisfied with their service"
Amsterdam to Boston return. I am very satisfied with their service. All the flights have been in time. Their customer service is very good, they reply almost immediately through their Facebook account if you have any questions. Specially for long distance trips I  recommend spending a bit more and being sure that you will arrive at your destination without any surprises.

### "Quick boarding at Madrid"
Madrid to Amsterdam. Quick boarding at Madrid Airport. Very clean Boeing 737 aircraft. Nice comfortable seat for an economy class cabin. Professional cabin crew looked fresh and groomed. Flight on time. The Captain gave a  Dutch, English and Spanish message.

### "outstanding customer support"
Amsterdam to Mumbai. My review is about outstanding customer support I received in Amsterdam airport from KLM. Having missed a flight and exhausted all opportunities with my unhelpful travel agent. My original KLM operated flight to Mumbai was changed in minutes by most helpful and cheerful transit desk ladies. There was a nominal transfer charge compared to a €1000 new flight charge from my travel agent. These ladies really saved my day. Thank you KLM and your wonderful team.

### "the great service offered"
Oslo to Madrid via Amsterdam. I would like to thank KLM for the great service offered. Fast and fluent boarding. Very clean Boeing 737 aircraft. Cabin Crew gave a warm welcome. We had a very early flight, the takeoff time was at 06:30 am, and all flight attendants had a very fresh and groomed look, smiling at all times and paying attention to safety. There were Power Plugs in every seat. The Captain gave a nice flight info. Very good Food options on both flights, with a broad beverages, offer. All flights were on time.

### "upward battle against limited options"
Houston to Brussels via Amsterdam. If things go wrong, you face an upward battle against limited options (flights), limited resources (costumer services, customer assistance). I paid 1700 euro for a comfort seat and they left me stranded in Amsterdam. No duty of care to be sure that I reach my final destination from the KLM side. Out the door the EU legal requirements. The plane out of Houston has an issue, KLM needs to get it fixed. Paperworks and repairs take 4 hours. Most passengers already miss the connecting flights before departure. Staff at the gate scare people away which see the issues coming because of their prior experiences. Before we fly, they have to get some drunken passengers of the plane including the one sitting next to me. Not even a Sorry Sir. Service degree as in nineties, AC dripping, cold all night, no new water bottle - I will fill it up for you Sir (really in comfort). Inflight entertainment system bad, no subtitle, breaks down and restarts issues etc. We get to Amsterdam. The whole 747 with connecting issues floods the service desk. They get annoyed by the passengers frustration, this situation ends up being hostile at the desk. The staff is well aware that due to end of holiday week KLM basically has no options  to offer passengers. Air France is full, KLM flights are full, Speed train are full (see later train desk told me). They give me a regular train ticket. While waiting the same women as at the gate reiterates her problem of meeting her connection to the river cruise in Basel. I suggest to call Lufthansa desk immediately as the only option to meet her deadline. The Service women all get hostile towards me. While the train ticket system breaksdown again, I notice the KLM assistance going in the Lufthansa option eventually. I get a train ticket no date no hour only a destination. The service assistant write down the departure time of the train by hand. Insists seat is numbered and I need to make it on time. I file a claim for my luggage and hope to meet my train. No train that fits departure time on screen. Queue to the train desk - no this is a train ticket but one for any train. No Sir Thalys is full  to Brussels. No regular train service, only this weekend works on the line. I find the Service desk in Terminal 2, have the 24 H desk of the Travel agency speak to the KLM rep. Travel agency insist KLM book me on the 8PM flight in Business, KLM refuses on grounds that there is awaiting list of economy passengers. With no drivers license I'm with one option left : 4 hours + trip of 4 trains, replacement bus service and taxi to Brussels Airport. So instead of the 10+ hours KLM, I arrive 21+ hours at the Airport not thanks to KLM though.

### "hope for a journey without the complications"
My customer journey with KLM left an incredible impact that marketing specialists can only dream of. It kept going on for over a month longer than my actual journey with KLM and created a number of lasting memories. The actual journey, however, never quite unfolded its full potential like a butterfly that's stuck in his cocoon. What a shame, I've heard many others say that KLM is a great airline. I can only verify this partially as out of the 4 flights I booked with KLM, I ended up only taking one. Here is why: One day before my departure from Berlin to Osaka, I received news that my connecting flight from Amsterdam to Osaka was cancelled. During the darkest hours of the night, some courageous customer service worker managed to put me on a Finnair flight which turned out to be a more than decent replacement. However, my chance to experience the Dutch Air Hospitality that KLM is renowned for was delayed. Talking about delayed, let me tell you the story of my flight home. The long haul from Osaka to Amsterdam was the only one out of the 4 KLM flights that I ended up taking. Once you manage to actually catch a KLM flight that's not cancelled, you receive warm and friendly service by the crew, decent-tasting food and a wide range of the latest cinematic enterainment options plus games and series. They even had some automatic kind of window blinds that turned the windows into a dark shade of blue (instead of the typical plastic blinds you get). This was very nice. I only wish I'd stayed up in the air for longer because as soon as we touched down in Amsterdam Schiphol, the chaos resumed. My flight to Berlin-Tegel was cancelled and I had to search for a replacement along with the numbers of other passengers who experienced a similar fate on that day. I arrived at Schiphol at 2 pm. The following hours included: me waiting in line - me being booked on a Lufthansa flight - being sent back from Lufthansa boarding because my name didn't get forwarded to Lufthansa - waiting in line again - being put on the waiting list for the KLM flight to Berlin later that evening - being sent back from boarding again because I didn't make it off the waiting list into the plane. Gotta mention that the customer service at Schiphol was very helpful the whole time, going through all possible options with me (I was disappointed that a rental car wasn't one, though!). You should have seen the look on the lady's face when I came back after the second failed connection around 9 pm. After 7 hours of from-A-to-B at Schiphol I resigned and agreed to a train connection the next morning and a hotel stay. These worked out. Unfortunately, my backpack got stuck in the loop at Schiphol and couldn't be given to me while I was there. It had to be claimed as "missing" and mailed to my address afterwards. Turns out the claim became real. My backpack really went missing and I had to wait 3 more weeks for it until receiving basically my whole wardrobe and souvenirs. Now that I am writing this, the compensation for products I had to buy as replacements for my delayed baggage has finally been paid (without problems) and I feel like my soul is finally at peace with this adventurous episode of being a KLM customer. When time has done its job mending the wounds, I will not hesitate to give KLM a second try. Looking forward to this future experience, a part of me hopes for another story to tell. Most of me however just hopes for a journey without the complications of this one.

### "Staff was very helpful and polite"
Amsterdam to Dar es Salaam return. First time with KLM and a very good surprise. Boeing 777 aircraft looks pretty new and offer great leg space in economy. Entertainment system was good as well with plenty of new movie. Staff was very helpful and polite. Food was ok. Will fly again with KLM.

### "miss the faithful little Fokkers"
Amsterdam to Billund. This trip was made in conjunction with the phase out of the Fokker F70 in KLM Cityhopper service. I deliberately booked this flight as a last salute to one of my favourite aircraft in which I logged almost 150 flights in the last 10 years. The outbound flight from Amsterdam to Billund was with a KLM mainline Boeing 737, nothing special, on time departure and arrival with the standard onboard service of a coffee and a snack. The return flight, in this case the very last Fokker 70 flight from Billund to Amsterdam ever started as a complete let-down at the gate, business as usual, just a bunch of absolutely unfriendly gate agents. However when boarding the aircraft everything changed totally. The aircraft cabin was decorated with little flags and once all passengers boarded, the captain entered the cabin and welcomed all passengers and explained why this flight was a special event. It was also the entire crew's last flight on the Fokker 70. Upon departure to the main runway we received a water salute from the Billund fire brigade, followed by a very powerful take-off and a low-level bye bye pass over the airport. Onboard service during the flight was standard but the cabin crew did everything to make the flight memorable, well done! Landing in Amsterdam was on the rarely used Eastern runway which is the runway used in the past by the Fokker company to test fly and deliver their aircraft to their customers. Upon disembarking all passengers were personally greeted by the captain and both cabin crew. We will miss the faithful little Fokkers!

### "in-flight service was outstanding"
Lisbon to Amsterdam. I never thought you could fit this many passengers on a 737, even EasyJet doesn’t pack them in this tightly. Seats are cramped and tight, also, no in-seat monitors, as a matter of fact, no monitors at all and also no onboard entertainment via WiFi nor any WiFi for that matter. The APU wasn’t turned on until 5 minutes prior to departure time and even though it was a 5 am departure, the aircraft was stuffy and hot. Given the tight seating, I was expecting a barebones service. This, however, was not the case, the in-flight service was outstanding. For breakfast, they served a tasty omelet sandwich. Service was fast, friendly and efficient, KLM unlike their American counterparts manage to serve the food and drinks at the same time. A+ for service and food, C for comfort and seating in general.

### "no sense of practical approach"
New York to Berlin via Amsterdam. KLM lost luggage. Customer service was beyond useless almost automated with no sense of practical approach. My mother’s luggage was lost for more than 45 days but I went directly to TXL airport and some nice personnel took the time to search the database and identified the lost luggage with on hand number. I contacted KLM that I found the luggage and if they could help me/ let me know how to retrieve it. KLM customer service pretty much said we do not care get lost. KLM does not assist in retrieving the luggage and returning the property to its owner.

### "equally unhelpful and rude"
Manchester to Antananarivo via Amsterdam. My new husband lost his passport 2 days before our wedding, 5 days before flying to Madagascar. After a  passport office appointment they said it would likely be done by Mon/Tues when we were meant to be flying Monday. On Monday we were home waiting for the post hoping the passport would arrive before our evening flight that we booked with lastminute.com (spoiler alert, it didn't.) First thing we rang lastminute.com  to ask the costs for changing flights and get advice on the best options if it didn't arrive, after being on hold for a whole 60 minutes they said not their problem they wont help and we need to ring KLM . So we rang KLM and the first person said they didnt know how much but it wouldn't be a problem to change and they would email the details through, so we waited a while. Then rang KLM again who said not sure whats happening but they would email again, then they of course didnt. Then rang KLM again who said not their problem we should ring last minute.com Long story short we bounced between lastminute.com and KLM and not a single person we spoke to would help us or point us in the right direction. Now we treated ourselves with an expensive holiday for our once in a lifetime honeymoon but we are by no means able to just throw money away, and as noone would help after 6 solid hours of ringing people, we drove to manchester airport to see if anyone on a desk there would help. Turns out as i stand there making a fool out of myself sobbing my eyes out at the KLM desk they won't help us either and told us to ring the KLM number. So I had to make a decision, as we were unable to see if our flights could be changed to another day for a reasonable cost and in a panic of not being able to afford new flights for both of us I checked in myself and left him behind to sort this mess, in the end he just had to buy completely new flights, which also meant he couldn't fly back with me. I appreciate this whole mess was caused by a stupid mistake of my husbands, but seriously how hard is it to talk to someone about a change of flight . And even if it isn't something you can help with, how hard is it to not lie and say you will help but then don't, or even how hard is it to treat people with a little empathy and kindness. Every single person i have had to deal with from KLM, from the phone, helpdesk, check in desk and flight attendants were rude and looked like the last thing they wanted to do was do their job properly. And on the way back our bags were lost and every person dealing with that was equally unhelpful and rude.

### "really impressed with the quality"
DXB-AMS-UIO and GYE-AMS-DXB. Dubai to Quito and Guayaquil to Amsterdam, 3 legs in B777-200 and last leg in B777-300. It is the first time I have travelled with KLM and I must say it won’t be the last. I am really impressed with the quality of everything: fantastic clean aircrafts, comfortable seats, leg space which is the largest in the industry I believe for economy class, very experienced Pilots with smooth take offs and landings (in the Andes Mountains to be specific) amazing entertainment with Arabic movies and Halal food options on the Dubai legs, but most important I have to praise the flight attendants. They might be mostly above the 45 age range but they were all very active throughout the 4 legs I had with KLM, even the 12 hrs flights and they handled the situation of the delay due to the technical error with a lot of experience and patience and never showed any attitude to any passenger even the Humble Andean old ladies sitting next to me. They were very friendly and helpful especially to me to make me catch my connection in Amsterdam and they let me go first off the plane. They kept me informed about my Dubai flight situation. Even when my luggage didn’t make it to my Dubai flight the situation was handled in a very professional way. I arrived in Dubai and headed to the lost luggage desk to be surprised that the agent was emailed by KLM about my luggage situation and informed me that my luggage would be delivered on the next flight which was emailed to me as well by the airline. My luggage arrived safely and was delivered to me followed by another apology email for the incident. No wonder KLM is the oldest airline still in service and celebrating 98 years. Thank you KLM for making my birthday trip across the Atlantic so memorable and unforgettable and you will be my airline of choice for the future.

### "Really nice airline"
Amsterdam to Copenhagen. Really nice airline, great service. Everything was clean in the aircraft also the staff was very friendly and on-time. The KLM app also worked great with checkin and had all the information I needed for my flight. Next time I am flying again with KLM.

### "rude, unhelpful customer service"
I called KLM customer service in Canada to make sure that they will take my pet in cabin from Edmonton to Dublin via Amsterdam, and they confirmed over the phone that they will, all the way to Dublin. So of course I booked the flight and submitted all information about my pet, and was ready to go. One week before flight I sent facebook message to KLM to make sure that all paperwork is in order. They didn’t answer right away, so the next morning I received a message saying that they are not taking my pet in the cabin from Amsterdam to Dublin because they are not approved carrier and it's only possible in cargo, which I understand but don’t understand why they never said anything while I was booking my flight? I was very disappointed, had to change all plans, rebook hotels etc. When I called customer service for explanation I did not receive any answer and they didn’t even know what i’m talking about, being very rude. Flew KLM many times and always had good time, but this situation is absolutely crazy. And what’s bothers me the most is how rude and unhelpful is customer service over phone in North America.

### "put me on Lufthansa flight"
Birmingham to Munich via Amsterdam. Efficient and very helpful re-booking (even on a different airline) after cancelling due to high wind. I got a text at 5pm the evening before my flight (original booking 11.20am next morning) to say that my flight had been cancelled due to high winds at Schiphol (Amsterdam); obviously there will have been a lot of planes affected and thousands of passengers so I was anxious about how I would get to my niece's wedding! I sent a personal message on Facebook (couldn't get hold of them any other way - all lines busy etc, not surprisingly) asking if there was any chance they could put me on the Lufthansa flight at 10.40am (direct, so avoiding Schiphol altogether); there was no reply by the time I went to bed but I awoke to a text message at 6.45am saying they had rebooked me on the direct Lufthansa flight to Munich as requested! I was totally amazed but really really pleased, and am very grateful to them. I am so glad I wasn't booked with a less reputable airline who would have offered bus/train vouchers instead and generally done as little as possible until forced to by the powers that be.

### "Seat very uncomfortable"
Flew Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi with KLM. Seat quite narrow, certainly with passenger of size sitting next to me. Seat very uncomfortable after a few hours, lack of support. Metal entertainment box under seat in front of me takes away 15% of leg space. Entertainment system stems from 20th century and is completely outdated. Didn't work for the first hour of the flight, resolution worse than a 10 year old phone. No response from flight attendant to service call. Food quality poor: bland and boring. I am a proud Dutchman, but why would you still fly KLM when you get a better service for a lower price at Asian and ME airlines. On the bright side: pilots are well trained and did a super smooth landing.

### "food totally unpalatable"
To start with positives, the plane was pretty tidy and well maintained and the supplies given were clean. The cabin crew was very soft spoken and helpful. Now the tough ones. The inflight entertainment system was horrible. Tiny screen with horrible viewing angles and resolution, could barely watch anything properly. The earbuds provided were of very poor quality. The food served, twice to be precise, was totally unpalatable. And to top it all up, we had baggage problems and no response received from the KLM's customer care. Would not recommend, would not fly KLM again.

### "cramped and uncomfortable"
Flew Amsterdam to Toronto with KLM. Staff were courteous. Flight was cramped and uncomfortable which is the norm on overseas economy class trips. We paid for assigned seats ($24 each) and did not receive them. Complained and was told the money was not refundable even though the service was not provided.

### "loyal customer with no extra benefits"
Bahrain to Cardiff via Amsterdam. As customers we have to except that cancellations do happen & that more often than not the decision to cancel is taken with our safety in mind. Every airline can run well under normal circumstances but a good test of a airline is to see how they cope with situations like these. KLM were aware of bad weather & by the time my flight had arrived had already cancelled a lot of flights, with this in mind you would of thought that a large business would ensure that they have enough staff on hand not only in the airport but also online & on the end of the phone to cope with the very predictable customer demand that would inevitably ensue. Not the case with KLM. Arrived in Amsterdam to a flight board of mostly delayed or cancelled flights, then had to virtually beg to get into the Crown Lounge with a Petroleum card despite being fully entitled to enter, I was later told that KLM staff were trying to reduce the amount of people in the lounge due to the cancellations. What is the point of issuing loyal customers with a privilege card if you are not prepared to give them the privilege in the first place? Upon being emailed & texted that my flight was cancelled I was given a link to click to re-arrange my flight, brilliant I thought, not brilliant as the link took me to a blank page. Not a problem I will go to the customer service desk & sort this. I (together with a lot of other people) had to wait for over 1hr and 30mins just to be seen, by which time all other seats were taken & waiting lists were at least ten deep for that days remaining flights. Not a problem, as I (& many others) hold a privilege card this takes my to the front of the "waiting list" for last minute seats, this is one of the major selling point of the privilege card system. But apparently when you most need this service KLM are not ready to honour it, leaving you as a loyal customer with no extra benefits that KLM had previously promised you in order to get your business & loyalty in the first place. 3 hours later I managed to re-book my flight, 5 hours later I managed to get to the hotel, to be far after this everything seems to be running ok. However, when you compare this airline to how other airlines cope with disruption KLM falls well short of just achieving basic organisation let alone good customer service. When you have your flight cancelled with KLM you will receive a voucher for 15 euros off inflight duty free which was not valid on my flight as my flight is under 70 minutes in duration. Or 2000 air miles credited to your account but only after you learn to read Dutch to decipher the voucher you have been given & then post in all your boarding passes & receipts to a international address, which will probably cost you the same in postage as the miles are worth. This is after you have tried to re-book your flight using one of the three online services they advertise, non of them worked & no response was received from any for over 12 hours. So in all likely hood you will have a 1 hour 30 minute wait to see a (understandably) fed up customer service rep.

### "a pleasant experience"
Newcastle to Venice via Amsterdam. First time with KLM and a pleasant experience. Outward flight in Boeing 737 was delayed for 25 mins because of early-morning fog at Schipol, and arrived similarly late. Aircraft clean and comfortable, although would prefer non-reclining seats for these short-haul flights to prevent interaction with inconsiderate passengers in front. Good connection at Schipol onto Embreaer 190 - what a nice little aircraft this is! But take-off again delayed owing to air traffic control, and landed 30 mins late. Return journey had 737 for both legs. Delayed again leaving Venice, but flight to Newcastle on schedule. Aircraft staff very pleasant and efficient, although would prefer some imposition of rules on cabin bags as too many oversize bags on board, greatly reducing the available locker space for those of us who observe the rules. Small snacks dispensed on all legs of flight - very welcome. Nice experience - will certainly use KLM again.

### "everything I need is in my suitcase"
Amsterdam to Bangkok via Paris. Very disappointed. After the flight from Amsterdam was delayed for 1h30m, we took off to Paris to transfer to the Air France flight to Bangkok, I had to run my ass off to make it just in time for boarding. Once in the plane there was a guy next to me taking up half my chair and half on the other side, cos of his huge size. After 12 painful hours I arrived in Bangkok. But my suitcase did not. It should have arrived today, but now they say it will probably be tomorrow. My holiday is on a hold right now because everything I need is in my suitcase, also this forces me to buy clothes and other things i need in daily life. There was no choice in meals. In flight entertainment seemed like it came from the stoneage. And poor service on board.

### "feel thoroughly cheated"
Amsterdam to Edmonton. The seats did not recline to horizontal. You slide off them so sleep is not possible. We paid some C$3000 each and expected normal business class accommodation. No warning of this sub-standard accommodation was given when booking through Expedia. Detailed research failed to reveal it. The senior purser agreed that it was well below standard. So did the station-manager in Edmonton. KLM customer support ignored their views. It dismissed our subsequent complaint on the basis that information about the seats "is explicitly presented on our website". In fact it is far from explicit. Firstly, you do not expect to pay a full business class fare and get nothing more than oversize economy seating. Secondly even if you spend time trying to check it is virtually impossible to work out which aircraft you will be on. In addition the promise that you will have a privacy canopy is surprising. There was none visible nor any sign that there ever had been. We feel thoroughly cheated. The casual dismissal of our complaint has made it worse. We shall avoid using KLM again where possible.

### "rock solid and uncomfortable"
Washington to Amsterdam. After a comedy of errors by KLM customer service which is unusual abnormal, we find KLM pretty decent. We boarded the refitted KlM Boeing 777-200 : accountants and profit were obviously the driving force here. The new slimmer lighter 17.5 seat width so plane now has a 3-4-3 configuration to squeeze in more passengers. Not only are they narrower but are rock solid and uncomfortable, still numb after spending 7 hours in them. Did anyone at KLM actually try sitting in these new seats for any length of time before buying them? Doubt it! If this is the way forward for KlM refitting these planes then its time to change airlines. Would have given no stars for seat comfort, but no option.

### "staff performance was very good and professional"
Flew Buenos Aires to Amsterdam. We received a warm welcome aboard. The captain came to greet every passenger in Business Class. The seats are very comfy and could be transformed into a fully-flat bed which can even accomodate persons with a larger frame. However, people with large feet could find it difficult to squeeze them into the rather small cutout in the back of the seat in front. The inflight entertainment system was very good and the movies on offer were entertaining. There were three mains to choose from for dinner. Food quality was very good. They served a breakfast before landing. The flight attendant in our aisle was friendly and professional, but we felt she did not want to go into conversations any further than her service duties required. But overall staff performance was very good and professional, the only exception being the check-in staff in Buenos Aires. The guy looked like he had just got out of bed. But we assume they are not directly employed by KLM.

### "a mediocre experience"
Zurich to Bangkok via Amsterdam. First leg from Zurich with a fabulous, socially very competent, young crew. Flight departed late but made up the time. On time arrival at the gate in Amsterdam. Service enthusiastic and personalized. Chicken wraps, small salad, a passionfruit cream and a bun as lunch. Less pleased on the second leg on board a Boeing 777-300ER with 2-2-2 seating in biz class. Not bad hard product, including the movie selection and the meal options. Ok wine/drink selection. Regarding the soft factors, the flight was just ok. The only personell interacting top professionally was the purser. His team members were not very interactive, very reserved, rarely smiling and not much around but during the food services. Comparing the two flights you might have guessed that you were using two different airlines. Therefore a mediocre experience. But at least for a competitive price.

### "worst experience I have had"
Glasgow to Tel Aviv via Amsterdam. The seating in business class on the flight from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv was poor. Just standard airline seating with a vacant seat in the middle and a tray insert there. So not at all a comfortable journey. Upon Arrival at Tel Aviv a piece of my baggage did not arrive. When I enquired at the baggage desk the person there told me they had been notified that the baggage had "not made the plane at Amsterdam" Clearly the fault of the baggage. I was assured it would be put on the next flight and would be delivered to me at my hotel. Sad to say this never happened. On contacting the baggage handlers at the airport, they again assured me the item would be on that night's flight and forwarded to me etc. Again it did not happen and this was repeated for the duration of my stay in Israel, from the 9th until 14th of Sept. It is now the 25th of September and despite being assured by KLM that my missing baggage would now be forwarded to my home address, it has not happened. I have contacted KLM via twitter, Email and Facebook and it is clear that one section does not talk to the other. I have now received an off hand twitter message telling me to complete the claim from online. In my more than 40 years of international air travel this is without doubt the worst experience I have had with any airline. Most upsetting of all is the feeling that there is an attitude of could not care less.

### "charged seating selection "
Singapore to Bali. Got a quite reasonable price for the tickets but the charged seating selection part was a little disappointing as most airlines would offer a non-chargeble seating selection upon check in. Flight back to Singapore was delayed 2 hours with some meal box provided, sounds fair.

### "nothing but praise for KLM"
Birmingham to St. Petersburg via Amsterdam. I have nothing but praise for KLM, I fly to St.Petersburg Russia via Amsterdam at least 4 times a year, and all flights have gone smoothly, the odd delay was due to airport problems, but connections were never missed. The price is good, the food nothing special, but that is not important to me. The seating, staff and whole experience has been excellent.

### "all legs of the trip were good"
Flew Freetown to Paris via Amsterdam. This was my first time flying KLM, and I was pleasantly surprised. I thought all legs of the trip were good. Cabin crew on all flights were polite, friendly and cheerful. The food was very good and plentiful, with a meal and snack served on the flight between Amsterdam and Freetown. They were generous with the alcohol, and I liked the fact that after dinner they came around with a small selection of spirits - quite rare in economy class these days. Though the TV screens were tiny, the IFE was adequate for the reasonably short flights, and there was a good selection of movies. I enjoyed flying KLM and feel they are superior in terms of both food and service to Air France.

### "outbound flight was ok"
Flew for weekend break to Ansterdam from Manchester. Terminal 3 at Manchester is appalling. The outbound flight was ok. Service was fine, though the cabin crew did not seem that friendly. Though it was acknowledged this was a short flight, a anack was provided. However for travelling at midday, the expectation would have been to have been served ay least a sandwich, not a small piece of cake, which was inadequate meaning searching for good at artival in Schipol Airport. Return flight was much better. The cabin crew was more friendly and alert and very attentive. Snack on this occasion was appopriate, for a 45 minute flight.

### "service doesn't meet expectations"
Flew Amsterdam to Copenhagen. Even though KLM is said to be a premium airline, service doesn't meet expectations. Also regarding the sustainability of the airline: you can't even get snacks without meat on their short flights. Unfriendly staff. Would not recommend flying with them.

### "avoid this provider"
Johannesburg to Amsterdam. I was on an 11 hour flight with a transfer to another 9 hour flight. The seats are tiny, so much so that if anyone sits next to you that has any mass whatsoever they are laying on you and or in your seat. We make it to Amsterdam where we have a layover and head to the KLM lounge where my wife has a membership. I'm flying with her, and at the lounge they advise us that no guests are allowed despite being married and a member of the lounge service. Customer service wouldn't budge on this. I'm confused, and letting everyone I know to avoid this provider at all possible.

### "experience was horrendous"
KLM has one flight a day from Denpasar to Singapore. On Sep 1st due to a technical fault they delayed and then subsequently cancelled the flight the next day. My experience was horrendous. We were dropped at a DPS hotel at 2am and told to be ready to fly tomorrow. That was the last I saw or heard from KLM staff. For 2 days I was left without any information, food vouchers or a rebooked flight. The hotel did their best to provide support but they weren't even in contact with KLM for most of the time. I received a letter 2 days later saying that the ground crew would assist, they never did. It said they would contact me via phone or email with my rebooked flight, they never did. It took 3 nights in a hotel before KLM rebooked me onto a new flight, even though there are 15+ flights a day on that route. I still haven't heard from anyone at KLM and any attempts at speaking to someone who is responsible for the welfare of the passengers on that failed flight falls on deaf ears. I couldn't imagine an organisation demonstrating such arrogance and a lack of care but I have now seen it with KLM. If they are cheap and you can afford to take the risk of being left in a hotel for 3 days with no help or information then go ahead and fly, however after experiencing how KLM deal with delays and cancellations you would be far safer to fly a Low cost carrier, especially on inter-Asia routes.

### "KLM was using Bulgarian Air"
Glasgow to Sofia via Amsterdam. The flight left Glasgow and arrived in Amsterdam on time. then it went downhill. The next flight was 2 hours late. I had to ask the staff at the airport which were no great help and after 40mins didn't know when the plane was even landing as the screen had not been updated. Eventually the plane arrived. KLM was using Bulgarian Air. The seats on board were very tight together. I had paid for a little extra room but didn't get any, the plane was dirty, no toilet roll in the toilets and the passenger safety leaflet was stuck together with chewing gum. None of the cabin crew could speak English. All the emergency instructions on the plane were in English. The cabin crew did not instruct the passengers on how to open the doors over the wings in case of emergency. Cabin crew didn't give instruction on life vest or oxygen mask proceedure. Throughout flight the cockpit door was left open for long periods of time. Cabin crew tried to hide this fact by closing the curtain. In this day and age this is shocking. Flight was so bad I booked a return trip from Sofia to London on Qatar with BA. The return from KLM I threw in the bin. Would I use KLM again - don't know?

### "hand luggage didn't show up"
Hannover to Jakarta via Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur. At first, someone sat on my seat and had my seat number. Thank God there was a seat empty so that the other passenger could sit during the flight. My flight was delayed for almost an hour. And then, another poor service from KLM airport crew was that I had to put my hand luggage in the luggage compartment of the aircraft. I was told that I could pick it in Amsterdam Schipol Airport. But it was so complicated and took three to four hours for me to get that. So I gave up, and they said that it would be safely send with the other luggage (the 23kg suitcase) to my final destination. In Jakarta, after two hours waiting, my hand luggage didn't show up. So I filed a report, and after three days it was sent to the airport but in a very poor condition. The handle and lock are severely broken. Today is the 21st day after my arrival and I have received only one e-mail that asked me to give the luggage details, which I replied as soon as I could. But until now, not even a single mail or call have I received. KLM should be able to handle baggage properly and not disappoint passenger like this. I have bought the ticket for round trip and hope this is my last flight with KLM. I would definitely prefer to pay more for more comfort and baggage safety.

### "didn't have the tools to give a good service"
Flew Amsterdam to Dubai. Unfortunately I am extremly disappointed with the poor Service that KLM have in Business Class. KLM is unfortunately lower than airlines like Lufthansa, Swiss or Alitalia (which I have flown a lot lately and they have really improved). I am not even considering some other airlines I fly every year like Qatar and Cathay Pacific. The seats are below market competition (I compare with Alitalia, Swiss, Iberia, Cathay and Qatar), and the food is not up to the standards of a Business Class. At least not what I use to fly regularly. The lounge is nice but the way you provide drinks and food is definetely the cheapest I have seen so far. Not a Business Class lounge at all. I had to go to the British Airways one that as I am a Gold member so they allowed me to enter even though I wasn't flying OneWorld. One good thing I have to admit. The people on the flight were extremly nice, they just didn't have the tools to give a good service.

### "airline that embraces its identity"
Warsaw to London via Amsterdam. First time flying with KLM since 1988. Very easy to check in online. Upon arrival at WAW, we used the self service kiosk to print our boarding passes, but could not print the luggage tags. Had to wait until the check in desks opened. At this point, there was no formal queueing system, so it was a bit chaotic. Once checked in, we were in the departure lounge within minutes. Both aircraft were clean and seats were relatively comfortable. Cabin crew were very friendly and courteous. A full bar service was available. I was particularly pleased to see KLM is very proud of its Dutch heritage - even the plastic cups have the KLM emblem, a clog, a tulip and a bicycle on them. Other airlines are choosing to look away from their nationality, so it is nice to see an airline that embraces its identity.

### "seat very comfortable"
Santiago de Chile to Amsterdam via Buenos Aires. A good solid Business Class product, although with the old World Business Class cabin. Seats are comfortable, as I did not want anyone to climb over me I chose seat 5D (in the aisle): I found the seat very comfortable, wide and long enough to support a few hours of sleep, as well as pillog (very soft) and blanket. In flight entertainment with a large screen and good selection of movies and content, noise-cancelling earphones not doing their job very well (but it happens in most airlines) therefore audio was not amazing. Service impeccable, crew attentive and present (but not overly present) made the journey pleasant. Food good, nothing to remember but above many business class products on the same route, the cold starter was good and the chicken was soft and juicy. The only small disappointment was the amenity kit - different between ladies and gents: the gents one is basically an empty bag with socks eyemask and teethbrush, no lotion no nothing. And the nice little touch of the Delft house is always a plus for KLM.

### "decent quality and service"
Flew Zurich to Bucharest via Amsterdam. I like KLM, nothing special, but decent quality and service. Seats and pitch better than with Lufthansa Group airlines. Food also better, especially on second leg with a pasta dinner during the 2 hour 20 minutes long flight time. No hassle at the airports, respected priority checkin, security and boarding. Second leg late due to a thunderstorm. Good communication from the cockpit. Distribution of water during waiting time. Somehow the flight was one of the last able to leave AMS after the services had restarted, so 1 hour and 30 minutes late arrival. Baggage delivery at OTP as always slow and disorganized. But that's the problem of the handling agent.

### "customer service was horrific"
I had an absolutely terrible experience with this airline. Originally my flight was delayed and at the gate we were being told that we were going to be able to board soon. The pilot would come on and keep pushing the boarding time back. Finally after spending over almost 5 hours waiting to board we were told that our flight was rescheduled and we wouldn't be able to leave until that evening. I was hours away from home and extremely upset. The customer service representative that I spoke to was extremely rude and claimed that there were no sooner flights with any other airline. I asked her to check and she kept saying that there was nothing. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she actually told me "no I had to listen to her first" before I could be transferred. When I eventually got in contact with a supervisor (45 minutes later) I requested to file a complaint in regards to how I was being treated. The supervisor refused to give me anyone's names, employee ID numbers, or any type of reference to my complaint and claimed it'd be noted on their file. After over two hours on the phone trying to get the issue resolved/being told they checked numerous times and no sooner flight was available I went online and found a sooner flight within 5 minutes! They claimed that they didn't see that flight and I was rescheduled for it. The whole ordeal was mentally and physically exhausting as I spent the whole day at the airport and ended up missing a day and a half of my trip to Budapest! I've traveled frequently but this time the customer service was horrific.

### "service very attentive and friendly"
Red eye flight from Abu Dhabi to Barcelona with 1 hour connection in Amsterdam. Aircraft from Abu Dhabi was an old A330, old business class seats with 2-2-2 configuration and not full lie flat. It's a similar type of seats that you'll get flying Air Asia X. Onboard service was very attentive and friendly, excellent cabin crews who made up the lack lustre hard products like the seats and the food/beverages. My luggage didn't make it in Barcelona and it took more than 30 hours to arrive. KLM refused my compensation claim due to I took more than 21 days to complaint in writing. This experience had left a sour taste in my first experience with this airline. I would not recommend a short lay over in Amsterdam airport with this airline due to KLM's incompetence in luggage handling, even if you are flying the premium cabin with Priority tag on your luggage!

### "new cabin is much improved"
I have not flown KLM for many years as I was unimpressed with their business product in the past but as a partner airline of Korean Air and the promise of an improved product I decided to give them another go. Flew from Incheon to Birmingham via Amsterdam. The new cabin is much improved however I was lucky enough on both inbound and outbound to get the single seats - I would have been very unhappy climbing over a seat mate as an individual traveler. The seat itself was very comfortable and I slept well. The major disappointment was the IFE the resolution on the screen was so poor it felt 20 years old and I couldn't watch for very long. Service was adequate but slow and sadly the food was rather boring for business class considering it was supposed to have been designed by a top Dutch chef. Overall my flights were fine but I'm unlikely to choose KLM again where Korean Air is available - their overall level of service is far superior. Final note never, ever serve warm champagne.

### "compliment on food and staff service"
Washington to Johannesburg return via Amsterdam. I chose KLM for this trip because of an extremely attractive price offered at the time of booking. The price was so good I upgraded to Economy Comfort which I believe is worth the extra cost. Upon arrival in Amsterdam, I deplaned and set about exploring options for occupying my 3-hour layover. After using the facilities and finding an open seating area for some relaxation and online activities, I discovered that my cell phone in its clip-on holster was missing from my belt. Panic set in an I retraced my steps and searched wherever I had been. I checked in with Lost & Found and while sympathetic and very helpful, they did not have my phone. What a depressing start to my safari adventure. I resigned myself to the likelihood that my phone was gone and I’d have to pay to replace it upon return to the USA. I boarded my connecting flight and had just gotten settled when I was approached by one of the flight attendants who held out an object in a plastic bag and said, “I believe this is yours.”  Life was good again. The phone had come un-clipped sometime during the first flight and fallen between the seat and the outside wall of the plane (I was in a window seat). The cleaning crew found it and turned it in along with the seat number where it was found. KLM staff researched the flight manifest and found my name and then looked up my itinerary and determined the next flight I would be on and forwarded the phone to the flight attendants on that flight. Now, that’s what I consider service. Thank you KLM. I would also compliment KLM on the food and staff service. Both were great. I will be checking KLM first in the future when looking to book flights.

### "irresponsibility and bad manners"
Barcelona to Lima via Amsterdam. The overall experience with KLM was a nightmare. We arrived at the airport in Barcelona and Transavia was not able to print our boarding cards for the second flight (Amsterdam - Lima). Due to bad weather, we had to sit for 90 minutes in the aircraft, waiting to take off. Due to the delay, we had 15 minutes to make it to the second flight in Amsterdam but since we had no boarding cards, we had to rush in to the transfer desk. At that point the Schiphol airport was already a completely chaos. Queues everywhere. Not info at all where should you start queueing and so on. We lost our flight and had to wait in line for 8 hours to get a re-booking. KLM told us that the next flight (the following day) was full, but we could fly via Bogotá to Lima. We didn't want to do another connection but KLM said that they would only cover the hotel for one night (August in Amsterdam, not a lot of budget options to stay overnight). Our agent in Schiphol was extremely rude. I can understand that she had an awful day, but waiting in line for 8 hours is neither fun. We ended up accepting the flight via Bogotá and headed to a hotel we booked (KLM hotels were all booked out but KLM explained that they will cover the hotel expenses afterwards). The following day we took the flight and landed in Lima without luggage. Nobody knew where it was. When contacting KLM they said that they were not responsible for our accommodation but Transavia and that regarding our baggage, we had to contact Avianca, the airline which brought us from Bogotá. 64 hours later (plus an overnight in Amsterdam with our luggage locked at the airport) we just received our bags. I can understand bad weather. I can understand chaos and delays. But I won't accept irresponsibility and bad manners. To me it seems as they just want to clean their hands as soon as possible, even if you buy the tickets from them.

### "you will not be helped"
On August 16th I would fly KLM Malaga to Amsterdam. In the morning when I woke up, both the mail and text came in. The flight has been canceled. Further information follows. Still confident that it would be good. A few hours ago, the news came that the flight we were in was now the next day. And then with a stopover. We would arrive at our destination more than 24 hours later. I could not afford this delay, considering work-related matters. Then you call. Wait for 40 minutes and you will not be helped. Eventually via Facebook Messenger had contact. But beyond that this was the best possible option and a referral to the complaint form, we did not arrive. Additional hotel accommodation was not offered. So I had to book myself. We are not informed about any refund or compensation. I have because I could not afford this delay to book a ticket with another company of € 400! While waiting at the airport, KLM had several flights to Amsterdam. Apparently, with a flight that goes beyond 24 hours later than planned, you can arrange everything yourself, at least when you fly with KLM. An annoying end of a vacation. Not on the same flight as my partner back. And huge costs due to cancellation. I am definitely going to file a claim.

### "very attentive service"
Long haul flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo with KLM. We paid a bit extra to have Economy Comfort seats. While Premium Economy (which is offered by other airlines) is usually a different service class with more generous seats and slightly better service, Economy Comfort seats are standard economy seats with more legroom and 50% more recline (on long haul flights). The service is exactly the same as in Economy. However, Economy Comfort seats are usually much more affordable than Premium Economy seats. We thought that the extra money was well worth it on this long flight. But the highlight of the flight was not the seat, but the excellent and very attentive service of the flight attendants. We will definitely take KLM again.

### "best service by far"
KLM is one of the best airlines with the best service I have flown. It was one of the cheaper flights on this route from Amsterdam to Barcelona and with the best service by far. They even serve free food on short haul flights wich is amazing. And a free water and another complimentary drink of my own choosing.

### "low fare, full service"
Very impressed With their service on this short hop from Copenhagen to Amsterdam with KLM. Cheapest ticket on specific dates. Full service done by very engaged staff who attended passengers special needs with a smile. Both flights were smooth and on time and flight deck kept us updated all through the flight. A complimentary snack served With drinks. Only minor issue would be the wait for baggage in Amsterdam but 50 min is better than most airports anyways. Would recommend KLM any day. Low fare and full service

### "30 inch seat pitch is just far too little"
Okay, let us take the good things first, even on the short trip from Düsseldorf to Amsterdam you were served something free of charge even though it was just water and crackers. Now to the bad thing. KLM will let you choose a seat but if you want an emergency exit seat you have to pay extra. On almost all other airlines you an choose an emergency row seat when you are lucky enough to be one of the first to check in. But on KLM, no way. If you do not want to pay extra then you are stuck in the seats with less than 30 inch seat pitch. Now I am 196 cm tall where most of my height is in the legs, so a 30 inch seat pitch is just far too little. KLM won't even let you move after the freight has started unless you pay. On most other airlines I have never complained about this because I had a chance to choose an emergency row seat, but I am a really strong believer in the fact that I should not pay more to have the same kind of comfort as a person only being 170 cm. So dear KLM drop this policy and maybe people will like you a little bit more.

### "good quality KLM transatlantic flights"
Washington to Amsterdam return. For the most part these were good quality KLM transatlantic flights, with on-time departure/arrival, comfortable seating (Economy Comfort leg-room is well worth the extra outlay when you're flying long-haul) and a friendly cabin crew. The only sour note was the food, featuring rather fatty chicken which disagreed with me considerably. I'll just put it down to an off week in their catering department (people do have cold periods from time to time) and fly them again sometime, since on a number of past flights I have found KLM's service (including the food) to be of a very high standard.

### "not a business class service"
Calgary to Amsterdam. The seat in business class are very uncomfortable. Not fully lay flat and no privacy having another passenger near to me. Every time he went to toilet I had to modify seat position and wake up in the night. Very bad food service. My seat was number 2 and flying dutchman cocktail was already finished. The lady did not apologise for that. I skipped dinner because of the smell of cheese of Alfredo pasta that permeate the cabin for a long time. I had breakfast. Film selection is ridiculous,  add few titles more. Bus at the arrival instead of the finger. Definitely not a business class service you expect.

### "better not to serve anything"
Aberdeen to Amsterdam in an old Boeing 737-700. Flight was on time and the crew polite. Before boarding in Aberdeen was a massive confusion everyone was put in queues mixed with other flights and ended up have to show my boarding pass 3 times. The service is a joke. To give people a tiny piece of cake and a plastic thing with water better not to serve anything. Just the rubbish that makes certain it is not environmentally friendly!

### "We enjoyed the flight"
Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Our first time fly with KLM. Good ticket price one way. Waiting for take off almost 1 hour but it was okay because watching the movies and playing the games. Friendly ground staff & stewardess and good service. We enjoyed the flight.

### "most pleasant flight"
Amsterdam to New York. This was the most pleasant flight. The pilot and cabin crew and waiting time were fantastic. Flight on time, cabin crew support and attitude was fantastic, very calming and relaxing. The pilot invited us when he saw us to see cockpit after landing and took picture from me. Many many thanks to him for warm greetings and fantastic landing.

### "Overall very average"
Cape Town to Amsterdam and back with KLM. First time flying with KLM. Usually fly Emirates but KLM offered a direct flight. Was very disappointed with the in-flight service. First impressions were good but as the 11 hour long flight progressed service got worse. To get the attention of the flight attendant is impossible unless you walk to the back of the aircraft. The button to get attention means nothing as they either keep switching it off at the back or ignore it. The attendants were a bit rude when asking for more alcoholic beverages. Food was average. In-flight entertainment was okay. A Few new movies. No structure to the series that they have. Overall very average. Wouldnt fly KLM again.

### "I am forever grateful"
Flew from London to Los Angeles via Amsterdam. Sometime during my flight, I realized my hearing aids - which I had removed, placed in the KLM sickness bag, and tucked into the seat pocket - were gone. I contacted the flight attendant and every effort was made to help me find them, including searching through discarded dinner trays and on board trash. After landing, KLM employees contacted the gate agent and arranged for the last possible place - the trash in the bathroom - to be searched. My hearing aids were found! The effort put out by the crew of my flight and the grounds crew was amazing, it was time consuming and a distraction as they turned the plane for the next flight. I am forever grateful! It is such a joy to fly an airline that truly does care about the passengers and goes the extra mile for them.

### "flights left and arrived spot on time"
Today's trip was a one-day return without any checked-in luggage flying from Amsterdam to Munich. This trip was booked using Flying Blue miles in Business class and for both flights seat 4F was selected. When checking in using the KLM app all was OK, but when I printed my boarding card at the airport I found out that I still had seat 4F in the outbound flight but that this was located in the Y section! When inquiring about this with the KLM check-in staff they informed me that this was due to a configuration change. But you are seated in Y+ and have the same legroom, so don't complain". In both Amsterdam as well in Munich I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security but could not use the Crown Lounge in Amsterdam. On the return flight (which was not changed) I could use the lounge in Munich. This is a dedicated KL/AF lounge which has limited amenities but featured a reasonable WIFI network. Both flights were the typical KLM short haul service, a pre-packed sandwich and a cup of coffee/tea in Y and a salad and 2 drink runs in C. Both flights left and arrived spot on time.

### "Incredibly frustrating being lied to"
Flew KLM from Paris to Aalborg via Amsterdam. 3 out of 4 flights in a row were delayed. The captain explicitly promised that the connecting flights were notified, and that everyone would make their flights. We ran all that we could, and arrived at the gate after five minutes. The doors had closed two minutes prior, and we were refused entry to the flight, despite staff still visibly boarding. According to staff, the captain had said one thing to passengers and reported another to staff. Apparantly this happens several times every day. Incredibly frustrating being lied to!

### "plane was clean and looked fresh"
Flew Kiev to Hong Kong via Amsterdam. KLM surpassed my expectations in terms of service quality and integrity. Booking at klm.com was easy. Options sold via simple and attractive interface. Mobile check in worked well. Bag drop at Borispil airport took 2 minutes. Boarding was a breeze. The plane was clean and looked fresh. Crews were polite and attentive. Eco comfort seating was lovely. Their European catering is strange, but since there is a full bar service, not much to be unhappy about. Transfer at Amsterdam requires lots of walking, but terminal is perfectly organized, signage is easy and smart, security search was efficient (but not overly fast), so I have easily made a connection of 55 minutes. My bag made it as well. On the plane I loved the Eco Comfort small and private cabin. The seating was perfectly comfortable with good legroom. Entertainment had loads of films and shows and kept me occupied for the whole flight. No USB, no touchscreen, but ok. I loved the crews (very friendly, hard working and caring). Catering was of very good quality. My Japanese option was delivered first and didn't disappoint me. Lots of drink rounds. Great plane. Sorry to see 747s being grounded and replaced. The only annoyance was an 80 min delay due to wrong balance of cargo load (the plane was 747-combi). Finally they unloaded the wrong cargo to let us go, but even after that we spent 30 minutes waiting for available time slot. Great communication from cockpit and cabin crew. 10 out of 10 despite delay and tasteless food on European flight.

### "A great experience "
Kuwait to Washington via Amsterdam. We had an early morning start in Kuwait, the Airbus was an older aircraft with angled lie flat bed seats but quite comfortable , the IFE was a little dated with quite an old selection of TV programs which I quite enjoyed the memories they brought back but the movie selection was quite new, food was tasty, I had the dal curry which was delicious. Flight attendants were very attentive and service was professional. We arrived on time in Amsterdam and enjoyed the 4 hours wait at the airport, the aircraft to IAD was a new Boeing 777-200 with huge lie flat beds in business class and and a much newer IFE, flight attendants as good as the first leg and the food was good too! A great experience and flight and they will be high on my list.

### "crew friendly and pretty attentive"
Amsterdam to Toronto with KLM in 787-9 Dreamliner economy class. It was a while ago flying a long haul flight with KLM and I was a bit concerned after many good flights with Singapore Airlines in recent years. But I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, service was much better than my last KLM long haul flight to Dar es Salaam. The crew were friendly and pretty attentive. Secondly, the food was tasty. It started with dinner (evening flight), finished with cheese quiche and ice cream in between. No problem to get more food if you left hungry and ask for. Enough drinks including wine, beer etc. Last but not least, the aircraft and IFE. For an 8 hour flight the seat width and pitch are reasonable. The electronic dimmable shades do work, mood lighting is nice and cabin noise is relatively low. In my opinion the biggest advantage of the 787 is the increased humidity compared to older aircraft. Nice IFE touch screen. However, if you look at the details my previous A350 flights with Singapore Airlines scored better on almost every aspect. KLM 787-9 is lacking a separate IFE control unit (for people who like gaming) and the screen is not adjustable, there could be more lavatories and it would be better if it had manual shades. Also the A350 cabin is a little bit wider. It would be nice if KLM replace their plastic cutlery for metal and replace the paper hot towels for cotton. The efficiency of meal service could be better as well (it was not very organised). Overall I was satisfied.

### "lovely cabin crew"
Flew KLM from Amsterdam to Curacao. It was a very nice flight, lovely cabin crew and the food was good! Not all of it but I liked the pizza. The seats and the seat pitch was also good, I am 5'5 and had a lot of leg space. The entertainment screen was a bit outdated but it worked nicely. The aircraft was old, if I remember it was 26 years old, there was no wifi on board but I didn't mind. Overall it was a very nice flight, with nice flight attendants.

### "cares about its passengers"
I was traveling on the 7th of June from Edinburgh to Zagreb via Amsterdam. I knew the weather was bad in Amsterdam and expected delays. The problem was that I only had 45mins to connect. Of course there was a delay in Edinburgh due to wind problems in Amsterdam. After waiting an extra 30 mins or so, we finally took off. On the plane I was told that I had missed my flight and I was re-booked with another airline. Being hopeful I still ran to the gate to try and catch my flight. Thankfully people were still boarding the plane, but apparently because I was re-booked to another flight I could not board. The lady at the gate though was very determined and did everything she could to get me booked on this flight again. After 15mins she managed to do so and I managed to board the plane. Very helpful staff! Very organized airline and cares about its passengers!

### "I recommend KLM!"
Miami to Dusseldorf via Amsterdam. KLM check in at Miami airport very slow. Very long cue behind us waiting for doing the check in. Flight to Amsterdam was completely full. Crew was very polite and friendly, food was very good. Flight arrived on time! Amsterdam to Dusseldorf leg was completely full too. Friendly crew on this 30 minute flight. I recommend KLM!

### "pleasantly surprised with my flight"
Pleasantly surprised with my flight on KLM from Amsterdam to Kiev. Flight was about 2.5 hours long but a decently tasting warm pasta meal was served along with a dessert treat. Wine and beer both offered. Flight left a few mins late due to staffing issues but those waiting were notified promptly. Ended up only a few mins late. Compared to what we get in coach in America now a days, this was refreshing.

### "very unprofessional cabin-service"
Flew Amsterdam to Belfast. Both KLM-flights operated by an ageing Cityjet Avro RJ85 to and from Belfast City were delayed by >2hrs. Both delays - on different tail-numbers - were caused because of technical problems which "had to be signed OK to fly" by called-in engineers. Very unprofessional cabin-service, far below KLM-standards. No transfer assistance upon delayed arrival in AMS, consequently connecting flight was missed by a few minutes and overnight stay became necessary.

### "a very comfortable plane"
Singapore to Denpasar. A short trip enhanced by a very comfortable plane, a decent meal and an excellent efficient crew. An extension of their Amsterdam Singapore route enables this flight to be operated by a long range well outfitted aircraft and it really made the difference. No Wi-Fi which would be an issue on a longer segment. Flight departed on time and arrived early.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service! I had a ticket from Ibiza to Amsterdam, and a separate ticket from Amsterdam to Oslo the same night. Without contacting me, they sent me an email the same morning informing me that my ticket was rescheduled for the day after due to overbooking. They did not even ask if it was ok and just cancelled the ticket, making me lose my flight from Amsterdam to Oslo. So I had to buy a new ticket from Amsterdam to Oslo. If you overbook, please ask the customer before canceling a ticket. And please be respectful when you speak with your customers.

### "staff exceptionally unhelpful"
Amsterdam to Montreal. With 8 hours delay the KLM staff were exceptionally unhelpful telling a customer that they can't make the airport more comfortable or the plane arrive on time but she can guarantee he'll sleep on the flight and asked him to move so she can serve another customer just to tell them the same thing. Nothing was offered for the delay except a tenner for food. And they announced the delay by 2 hour increments instead of allowing passengers to make other plans or even catch some sleep. I wouldn't recommend KLM and won't be travelling with them again.

### "cabin crew were friendly and professional"
Today's trip was a one-day return without any checked-in luggage. In both Amsterdam as well in Norwich I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. The Crown Lounge in the Non-Schengen area of Schiphol Airport was crowded but well stocked for breakfast. The lounge in Norwich is a contractor lounge with limited amenities but featured a reasonable WIFI network. The flights were the typical KLM Cityhopper regional service. The outbound flight was delayed with approx. 45 min and the return flight with almost 2 hours. On both airports the ground staff had chosen to provide their passengers only the bare minimum of information about the delay. I only learned from the captain on the return flight that today's delays were due to faults in the underground fuel system at Amsterdam Schiphol airport. On both flights, the onboard service consisted of a pre-packed waffle and a pre-packed cup of water. To my surprise on the flight to Norwich coffee or tea were offered considering the 30min. flying time. The outbound flight to Norwich was a Embrear 190 substituting the usual Embrear 175 while the return flight was operated by a Fokker 70. Both aircraft are fitted with leather-covered slimline seats, however the older Fokker offers a more generous legroom then the Embrear. In contrast to the Ground staff at both airports, cabin crew were friendly and professional.

### "very decent snacks and drinks"
Hanover to Lisbon via Amsterdam on KLM: very good by short-haul standards. Hanover and Amsterdam ground staff friendly and efficient. Amsterdam airport was very busy. Still it was easy to move between the gates. Flights were on time, staff polite and very decent snacks and drinks were served.

### "I enjoyed flying KLM"
Zurich to Birmingham return via Amsterdam, all four flight excellent! Very friendly crew (air and ground), pleasant and happy announcements, I enjoyed flying KLM very much. Since all four flights were an hour or less, basic catering but staff did not seem stressed, still smiled and were very friendly! I had a very relaxed trip, thank you, KLM.

### "would definitely recommend"
Very pleasant experience overall flying KLM for the first time. From Brussels to Amsterdam we flew on a Fokker 70 - no surprise it was a bit cramped on this flight considering the size of the aircraft. However the staff and service on board was nice. From Amsterdam to LHR we flew on a more spacious E175. Despite the short flights we were given snacks/refreshments on board as well. Lovely experience with KLM, would definitely recommend.

### "not a pleasant experience"
Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi. I did not have a pleasant experience with KLM . I booked a flight with Etihad and didn't realise that one of the flights was with KLM until day of departure, which I didn't think was going to be a problem. First of all, the seats were not comfortable compared to other airlines I've flown with. You can't pull the arm rest up to get it out of the way. I requested a vegan meal which did not go through to them, so I was left with no options on the flight for food - the flight attendant just offered me an apple when I brought it to their attention - this was a mistake of the airline. I accidentally left a jumper on the plane and contacted KLM immediately. They were quite hard to get a hold of - I waited on the phone for ages before giving up and messaging them through facebook which they have finally responded (slowly). In regards the the jumper they told me to contact abu dhabi airport and when I did, abu dhabi told me it was the responsibility of the airline if I left it on their plane. KLM said that if they found anything, they would give it to the lost and found at the airport - Abu Dhabi found nothing so they obviously did not hand anything in to the lost and found.

### "Very poor service"
Flew KLM from Sao Paulo to Amsterdam. Very poor service. Seats are terrible, as is the food. Very little food as well, I think there was less than 70 grams of protein in my fish dish. The placed some water and snacks in the galley but when it is all taken they arrogantly don't replace it so you need to ask. They seem more interested in chatting among themselves. Really bad. The website is bad as well and they don't inform you adequately about how many points you will make and always offer the worst ones for this, which only gives you 25%. All in all, bad. But punctuality is good and Amsterdam as a transit airport is efficient and hassle free.

### "The staff were great"
Amsterdam to Bangkok. This is the first time I've flown KLM, I've heard good things from the airline from family members which is why I booked. At the time KLM was best value for this route which was also a deal breaker. The aircraft was new with the 3-4-3 layout in economy. The seats on KLM did feel a bit narrow however may be due to the design of the seat. But the legroom was amazing, the slimm seats give you more room. i could slouch in my seat with the person in front reclined and still have room to spare. The in flight infotainment was ok, a few movies were good, some good series but no where near as good as other carriers. I was expecting a larger screen, it was ok but could have been better. Each seat had a USB and plug socket, very helpful. The staff were great, very friendly and came round often enough with drinks, food and snacks. Couldn't fault the staff. I was sat in the first economy cabin, a few rows after the economy confort seats, so I was a bit annoyed that I couldn't have my choice on the inflight meal, so I had to get the pasta but it was tastey and the aribiatta sauce was nice. The breakfast option was weird. It was a scrambled egg/omelette, was edible but not nice or horrible. Would fly KLM again but think I'll pre order and upgrade my meal choice.

### "Staff rude and condescending"
Cape Town to Amsterdam. Business class disappointing. Unlike other carriers 2 seats were together so you had to step over the person next to you who was sleeping in a flat bed to get out. No privacy. Food was just ok though in flight service by staff was very good. No sheets for the bed like on Asian carriers. Just OK. Lounge in Amsterdam very disappointing. Staff were rude and condescending. Value for money was poor. Food was just so so.

### "just a regular flight"
My boarding pass could not be generated by mobile check in system for CGK-KUL sector, so I have to queue at check in counter just to print my boarding pass, but it worked for KUL-CGK sector. Flight departed on time and so did the return flight. Boarding was done efficiently for both sector. The cabin crew seemed tired. In flight entertainment is ok. It's just a regular flight.

### "Had a great experience"
Berlin to Amsterdam. Had a great experience with my 2 short flights. The staff was as friendly as possibly can, my wife is flying anxious and they offered their help throughout the flights. They even showed her an app on an iPad to help her overcome her fear! For a 55 min flight we even got snacks and drinks, I did not expect that. Pretty tasty too. And the ticket was quite cheap. I would love flying with KLM more often!

### "don't mind someone climbing over you"
Toronto to Amsterdam. This was my first business class flight since I retired 10 years ago. The pre-departure lounge was quite good, and I loved being able to lie down to sleep on this overnight flight - very comfy pillow and blanket. I had a window seat and the drawback was that in order to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I had to literally climb over the bed of the person next to me. Try that when the plane is bouncing around! The window was so far from my seat that I had to unbuckle to look out. In an economy or comfort seat, one has under the seat in front of you, or the back of the seat in front, to put things. In business class, there was only one small shelf available and couldn't use it during takeoff and landings. There was no wifi on the flight but the movie, etc. selections were fine. I have flown in KLM comfort class before and for the money, I think it is the best choice, unless you get an aisle seat and don't mind someone climbing over you.

### "would rather not fly with the airline"
Have been flying with KLM all over Northern Europe with bussniess for the past 10 years and if honest, would rather not fly with the airline. They aren't the worst out there but many a time the flight has been delayed due to the connection via Amsterdam. Ground Staff at the airports are a mixture. Some excellent people however more often than not others are well lets just say they should be working in another industry if they can't be bothered to have basic manners. This has been my experience over the years at least in various airports in different countries. Food on the flight is pretty basic and disappointing however lounges are good and would recommend.

### "Had a great flight"
Rio de Janeiro to Amsterdam on one of KLM's new Boeing 787-9 aircraft. Upon arrival at the airport I was upgraded to an economy comfort seat for and the check in went super fast. As a sky priority elite plus menner, I was handed an invitation letter to the GOL lounge. The food and drinks in the lounge were nice and there was sufficient variety. Boarding was on time and went in an orderly fashion. After an on time departure soon dinner was served. The seats were comfortable and the entertainement system had lots of new)movies. Halfway I decided to stretch my legs and walked over to the galley. A variety of snacks and drinks were available and the stewardess offered coffee. About two hours before landing breakfast was served containing scrambled eggs, bread, cheese, fruit and pastry. After landing luggage was on the carrousel within minutes. Had a great flight.

### "Terrible experience with KLM"
Terrible experience with KLM on Lima to Edinburgh via Amsterdam and Paris. A long trip by any standard, made further complicated by KLM routing me via CDG when there is a direct flight from AMS to EDI! Firstly, check in at Lima was a mess, taking an hour in a badly organised queue with people getting angry. Then departure was 40 mins late with no explanation given. Also, despite checking in as soon as check in was open, KLM did not let me choose a seat ('unavailable' for some reason) and placed me in a middle seat, between 2 strangers! For a 12 hour flight. The seats were very hard on the Boeing 777, and the food was quite bad, at the level of hospital food or worse. IFE showed the same films I'd seen on the way there (with AF, a better experience). Then, arriving in AMS and tired after a long trip, I asked if I could not be put on the direct flight to EDI so as to save time and hassle; I was given robotic answers that this was 'impossible' with no explanation. After that, I find out that the Amsterdam to Paris flight is 30 minutes, then 1 hr late, making me fear I'd lose my connection! I barely made it, having to run in Paris CDG. Of course, luggage did not make it. I am very disappointed as I am an AF-KLM customer for 15 years with close to 100k miles and no consideration was given to this; the airline labels itself as the 'most punctual in the world' in its literature, which makes me laugh based on my experience. I have put in a formal complaint and will try to avoid this airline in the future.

### "good, friendly, professional"
Milan MXP to Amsterdam. This was a very short flight operated by KLM City Hopper. The flight was approximately two hours, service was good, friendly, professional, and a cheese sandwich with a beverage was served which is more than any US-based airline will ever give you on such a short flight in an economy cabin. I booked an economy comfort seat but to be honest I did not notice more legroom or more recline on my seat in this aircraft. Because it was only a few dollars I really did not look into it however I am not sure that the city hopper aircrafts have such seats available.

### "Wi-Fi was not offered"
Amsterdam to Manila via Taipei. In Taipei We had to exit the airplane, go through customs, wait in the terminal and then return on board. This was a nice break for such a long flight and the fact that we did not have to change aircraft was also very nice. I paid extra for an economy comfort seat and for a gourmet meal. The meal was amazing and worth the extra $20.00. The economy comfort seat had decent legroom however I did not find it that comfortable, I also understand that on a 16 hour flight at some point your seat will become uncomfortable. KLM flight attendants did a great job at ensuring that there were some space in between the rows. For example I was seated in a three seat configuration and they made sure that the middle seat was empty. I learned a good lesson however which is never to book a window seat on such a long flight that way you avoid disturbing the person in the aisle seat specially if you are the restless type that needs to walk around the aircraft. I normally do not get up from my seat much but somehow I found myself quite restless and uncomfortable at times on the seat. I do have to say that I was very disappointed at the fact that on this flight and on this excellent aircraft Wi-Fi was not offered however the entertainment choices on the interactive screen were decent. 3 hot meals were served and every two hours they passed by with the trolley and offered snacks and beverages. With the excellent service provided by Asian airlines like EVA I am not sure I would book KLM again for this type of a journey however they remain one of my top favorite airlines for flights from and within Europe.

### "new slimline seat is just too invasive"
Kuala Lumpar to Amsterdam in a code share with MH due to its attractive flight times and the ability to fly into HUM in the UK, transiting through Schiphol. Boeing 777-200 with new slimline seats. Having now experienced at first hand this seat I can only agree with the many reviewers that the closeness to the passenger sitting next to you is just too invasive. What I did like was its firmness and especially for taller passengers the vertically extendable headsets for good support but it desperately needs to be a few centimeters wider to win over my seal of approval. Even the so-called Economy Comfort seats (not to be confused with Premium Economy on other airlines) are only a fraction better as the added comfort might be in length and recline but not in width. Immensely appreciated the mixture of young and older stewardesses and top marks for the way they interacted with all passengers during the flight. On my two trips the pursers were situated in my section, whose professionalism I greatly enjoyed. And one of the stewardesses was working on her last flight before getting married. This was with great fanfare announced by the captain followed by a guest appearance of one the off-duty pilots to congratulate her in person and making himself available to answer questions from passengers. Usage of the inflight entertainment system was easy and had a good selection of new, recent and foreign movies that I was able to catch up on. A few notes on the preparation of the trip, it was disappointing not being able to bid for an upgrade to business class as stated on the KLM website for the legs. Oddly enough, on this leg some business class seats were available to which I happily would have made a competitive bid.

### "customer service is unacceptable"
Terrible experience! I arrived in Newcastle at 830am on Thursday and discovered that my luggage had not arrived with me. I have experience this before with other airlines and understand that losing your luggage is a risk you take when flying. However, that was 3 days ago and I have called the airline 6 times to be told 6 different stories and different times to expect my luggage. They confirmed that my luggage was found and arrived in the UK (1 hour from when I am staying) on Thursday evening and said it had been picked up by the courier they hire on Friday morning. Currently the earliest expected delivery time they can give me is Monday evening. This is 5 and a half days after arriving in the country (and that is providing this information is not false like the previous 5 expected arrival times). I have asked to speak to the department manager but have been told that one is not available every time I have called. We travelled to England for a special occasion and ultimately do not have clothes to wear to that occasion. We have altered our travel plans in order to always be at the delivery location we provided in case the luggage does show up. This type of customer service is unacceptable in my eyes. I will never flying KLM or recommend it to anyone again.

### "not really premium at all"
Houston to Amsterdam. I fly regularly between the US and Europe, usually on premium economy. Most times I end up on Lufthansa, British Airways or SAS, who all have wider seats, bigger screens and power supply in their premium economy class (I avoid the US airlines for all it's worth). The additional leg space and seat width makes the difference for me. For the first time I chose to try KLM premium economy for my Houston to Amsterdam trip. What a disappointment! The seats were the same as in economy class, i.e. exactly the same width. The only difference was a few inches extra of leg space. If you choose an emergency seat, which costs less than the premium economy on KLM, you basically get a better product. The screens looked like they came from a different era, pixelated and tiring to look at. Also, there was no power supply at all. Comparing with standard economy class it is of course much better to have the extra leg space, but compared to the competitors the KLM 'premium economy' is not really premium at all!

### "very pleasant flight"
Very pleasant flight with KLM flying from Lisbon to Warsaw via Amsterdam. On both flights airplanes were pretty old, a bit worn out, old fashioned, no any kind of inflight entertainment, but both flights were right on time and very nice. Catering was decent (either warm pasta with cookie or wrap, full soft and alcohol bar), but the best thing with KLM are the crews who are always extra friendly, smiling, chatty and professional. Totally recommended.

### "very friendly welcome by the cabin crew"
I flew with KLM on the 3rd April from Lisbon to Newcastle via Amsterdam. Before I arrived at Lisbon Airport, I checked in online using the KLM app which was a very smooth and easy experience compared to some airline apps. On arrival at the airport I checked in my bags at the bag drop using the boarding pass which I had on my phone. The staff around check-in were absolutely fantastic, couldn't have been more helpful. As I boarded the aircraft, I was given a very friendly welcome by the cabin crew. The flight departed 15 minutes behind schedule due to an issue with ATC in Amsterdam. Once we were airborne the crew began to serve breakfast which consisted of a Dutch breakfast sandwich and a choice of drink. The sandwich was actually quite nice although the appearance did not look so tasty. Throughout the flight the cabin crew continued to serve light snacks and beverages, and the service was outstanding. The time lost at Lisbon had been made up during the flight and we actually arrived at the destination 5 minutes early than anticipated. I would certainly fly with KLM again for their outstanding service and value for money.

### "always a pleasure to fly with KLM"
It's always a pleasure to fly with KLM on this route from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Check in and boarding is always easy and hassle free. Enough information was given before the flight-boarding time, gates, etc. The ground crew were efficient and friendly. However I was not aware the departure time was 16.20, as I remembered it being 17.10. But no matter because we have reached the gate early. On board, the FA's only serve veggie pie which was not delicious. Beverage selection was great with wine served on request. The airline should seriously consider to change their "veggie pie" menu.

### "flight with a great service"
Copenhagen to Tehran via Amsterdam. Nice flight with a great service. Business class was full and lots of children hopping around. Crew was exceptionally good, getting things done efficiently as well. I liked the starters. Saw two films and service ended with a traditionally Dutch snack. Seats had good lounge position. Toilets were kept clean throughout the flight. My suitcase was one of the first out. Could not have been better.

### "staff extremely friendly and helpful"
Frankfurt to Curaçao via Amsterdam. I had read a lot of negative remarks that we chose KLM rather resentfully, but the itinerary from FRA was more convenient than Air Berlin. For Curaçao, there was no other reasonable choice. This little competition makes the tickets rather pricy in comparison to flights to Asia. Their website is awful in many respects (I would have to fill pages, so I don't write why), that made our expectations not very happy either. We were very surprised that none of our prejudices turned out to be confirmed. Not a single delay, on the contrary - we reached all destinations up to 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Friendly staff on ground and in the air. On both long hauls, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful - we are accustomed to Asian Airlines and have become quite fastidious about service, but this reached the same level. Our prebookings of gluten free and Hindu meals had been lost by their sappy website, but the staff did their utmost to compose some convenient replacement food for us and re-ordered instantly our meals for the return flight (with success). The quality of the food itself was average but edible. The movie entertainment consisted mainly of stale news, mainstream thrillery, or animations which I preferred because the screens are not good enough for any dark scene in a normal movie - you see nothing but a black screen. Because of the cheap earbuds, acoustics qualities are very low and it was hard to understand much of the dialogues in English (English subtitles would help a lot!) - and there were few films in German. Seats were okay and there was enough legroom, so that we could even slide down a bit and sleep. For flights to the west, we will certainly book KLM again.

### "it lived up to expectations"
Amsterdam to Nairobi. First time trying the New World Business Class and it lived up to expectations. The cabin staff is very friendly, attentive and looks natural. This is the best cabin staff I have experienced, and I typically fly Economy. The new seat design puts KLM in a higher league, and the cabin space is quite relaxing, not giving impression of being full. Meal service is well time and diverse enough, good choice and what you expect in a normal Business Class. KLM fares are high for the Dutch market, but their scheduling is the best for making most of your work days. IFE is a bit dating as most aircraft now have some high def screens, but like many people I pack my own gear so this is not much relevant. All in all KLM is living up to expectation, no delays and the ground service is Schiphol is flawless. Time to upgrade the A330 fleet!

### "consider them for the next trip"
London to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam. First flight with KLM and was a bit apprehensive, as connection from London was very short. The SkyTeam Lounge at Heathrow is adequate, enough space to sit and have a quiet drink and a snack. There is WiFi. Catering OK, but my usual carrier is Etihad, so the experience was a little different, no a la carte table service. Flight boarded at T4 from the gate opposite the Lounge, very convenient. At Schipol we had just about 50 minutes from touchdown to the onward connection, which was enough time to have a quick drink, find our way to the gate and immediately board the next flight. With such a short connection I was worried our luggage wouldn't make the flight, but when we arrived at KUL there it was! The new World Business Class is very open and comfortable. The seating is great, save for the fact that you have no direct aisle access for the window seat. If you are travelling as a couple this is fine, for solo travellers it might prove tiresome. The on-board service was great, the staff were attentive and extremely helpful. The catering was OK, very Dutch shall we say! The drinks were good quality, but a bit mean. Nothing that one could really grumble about. The in-flight entertainment is good quality and there was an adequate range of new and classic programming to keep me entertained until bed time! The bed is great and I slept like a baby. Even though they are older aircraft I like the sense of space you get with the Boeing 777, which somehow you don't quite feel on other aircraft even the 380. The price was comparable to Etihad (about GBP 300 more) but the flight is 1hr to AMS, a 1hr layover and then a 12hr leg to KUL. Reverse journey the same timings. For EY you have a 3 or 4 hour layover and now they have adjusted their timetable you have to either leave UK early in the morning or arrive very late to KUL. The KLM timings are much friendlier. We left LHR at 17.00 and arrived in KUL 16.00 a much less stressful journey. Am flying back KLM and will definitely consider them for the next trip too.

### "fantastic 2 flights"
Fantastic 2 flights from Vienna to Oslo via Amsterdam. Economy Comfort seat had generous pitch. Flight attendants on both flights were the warmest and friendliest I have encountered in years. Usually fly Lufthansa/Austrian and the difference in the level of service offered by these attendants was incredible. Both flights left on time and landed early. Small snack and drinks offered, plane clean and presentable. Would definitely recommend KLM.

### "the service is great"
San Francisco to Nairobi via Amsterdam with KLM. I take this trip at least once a year. The aircraft is new and kept clean. In December 2016 we flew the new planes and that was a pleasure even with so many people on the flight. The trip from Amsterdam to Nairobi, the planes are not as new for some reason, but the service is great though.

### "Beware of KLM"
Stuttgart to Lisbon via Amsterdam. Booked thi9s as KLM, they chose Transavia. Paid for KLM, transavia although a daughter of KLM acknowledges absolutely nothing of KLM. Sardine seating plan. Absolutely everything extra for a charge. No priority boarding which means the last 50 get to check in all hand luggage. Beware of KLM.

### "I would recommend this airline"
Amsterdam to Oslo return. Outward journey perfect, on time, snack a cheese salad wrap (an improvement on the falafel wrap). Return journey, just under an hour delay, no problem for me but some people missed their connecting flights. I would recommend this airline.

### "crew was friendly"
Bali to Singapore. First time flying KLM - awesome food. Low sodium meal given as requested and still as delicious. Inflight entertainment has good variety and was updated and easy to navigate. Crew was friendly. Leg space was cramped for a even a petite girl like me.

### "quality was extremely low"
Amsterdam to Vancouver. Outdated plane. Very small entertainment system screens, not even a screen in front of us, we had to look from aside. Old, fabric seats (didn't seem very hygiënic). I did like the food. Enough variation and a veggie option. Crew members were friendly overall, except for one lady. We paid the same as we did last year, but the quality from this flight was extremely low. Too bad they arect consistent regarding the quality.

### "a truly superior product"
Amsterdam to Buenos Aires. The new busienss class seats are excellent. Full flat, enough small ledges to put ones glasses etc. on. Also enough 'free' space for shoes and small carry-on accesories.Good color scheme, friendly crew and a good meal. The meal was served in a relatively quick way, not like some other airlines which take two hours to serve dinner in C-class. Very pleasant experience. This new business class is a truly superior product.

### "KLM, never again"
Dusseldorf to Kilimanjaro via Amsterdam. KLM, never again. First flight in Düsseldorf delayed, time for stopover in Amsterdam 1 hour planned by KLM, missed connecting flight in Amsterdam, waiting time on transfer desks 2 hours, waiting time in Amsterdam 9 hours without getting any vouchers for drinks or food, next flight with additional stopover in Nairobi, arriving Kilmanjaro 12 hours delayed and missing our luggage This is our third and our last failing flight operated by KLM without luggage and it is always KLM. It seams there is a precious big chance of that happening when you book KLM. We are travelling a lot and we had never problems with flights or airlines except KLM. Certainly KLM is not responsible - because of weather etc.

### "head and shoulders above any US airline"
KLM stands head and shoulders above any US airline for international service. Flew from New York JFK to Kilimanjaro via Amsterdam. My seat wasn't great (the in-arm movie screen didn't seem to want to cooperate), but they got it working. In the end I moved to another seat and all was well. We were served a hot dinner (with two choices) after a complimentary beverage. The during dinner we were offered another beverage. After dinner we were offered yet another beverage. All complimentary. The movie selection was atrocious! Am hour before landing we were offered a breakfast snack - it was fine. Again, more than you would ever get on a US carrier. Flight to Kilamanjaro was equally good. Great food and beverages. Same mediocre entertainment. On time arrival. Overall excellent!

### "No more KLM for us"
Mexico to Amsterdam via Paris. What a disappointment flying with KLM. They have a policy now to not put family and couples next to each other automatically so you will be forced to pay extra per seat during check in. In addition, our flight back was delayed which resulted in us missing our connecting flight and having to wait 6 more hours. To top it up, just when the nightmare is over, one luggage went missing and still missing at this time. Very frustrating. No more KLM for us ever again. Book at your risk.

### "TV screen is so small"
Amsterdam to Washington. I had no other choice but flying with KLM. It doesn't seem to have other options from Brussels on Fridays. It was such a bad experience : the meal. Despite a paid meal I didn't know what I was eating. The TV screen is so small (or the way info are displayed) that I needed the support of the person beside me to be able to use it. No question to ask the help of the cabin crew, they are too busy to help. After the duty free service (crew is very active to do it), the crew disappeared, you need to chase them if you need anything. They don't serve anything like water during the whle flight after services.

### "don't trust them anymore"
Humberside to Berlin via Amsterdam. This was a most stressful and unpleasant flight I ever had in my life. I used KLM in the past and was ok. This time it was different. It started with delay 1h 15 min because aircraft break down from start, then in Amsterdam another delay because pilot discovered that there are linkage on landing gear. In Berlin I want to change my ticket and staff were unfriendly and finally I tried to call KLM. It was nightmare and I never got through. I hope other people will not have not have the same experience I had. I will never fly with KLM, don't trust them anymore.

### "must have really gone downhill"
Frankfurt to Washington via Amsterdam. I chose KLM because of hearing in passing how great KLM's service is and their food. They must have really gone downhill. The passenger next to me agreed we could not tell what the frozen green mush was next to our frozen meatballs. The food was disgusting and tasteless. The only thing really worth eating after thinking about it was the roll. And KLM's service was mediocre at best, the attendants seemed run down and not chipper at all. The flight was ok but the airplane has very outdated entertainment systems. Not touch screen. I could get past that but really don't waste your time thinking you would have some type of exceptional service if you fly KLM. By the way bring a pillow their seats have no back cushioning at all.

### "staff were extremely polite"
Lisbon to Amsterdam. The staff were extremely polite, attentive and smiling. Information was provided at all times and it was a smooth ride. I was served by an extremely nice lady at the check-in who listened to some concerns I had and arranged for everything to be perfect. The only thing I would look into : the seat was a bit too tilting.

### "Cabin crew were friendly and professional"
Today's trip was a one-day return without any checked-in luggage. In both Amsterdam as well in Hannover I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. The Crown Lounge in the Schengen area of Schiphol Airport was not too crowded and well stocked for breakfast. The lounge in Hannover is a contractor lounge with limited amenities but featured a good WIFI network. The flights were the typical KLM Cityhopper regional service, both left reasonably in time but arrived spot on time at destination. On both flights, the onboard service consisted of a pre-packed muffin and a pre-packed cup of water. To my surprise no coffee or tea was offered, probably due to the 40min. flying time. The outbound flight to Hannover was a brand new Embrear 175 while the return flight was operated by a Fokker 70. Both aircraft are fitted wit leather-covered slimline seats, however the older Fokker offers a more generous legroom then the Embrear. Cabin crew were friendly and professional.

### "configuration seriously outdated"
Flying to Kigali out of Amsterdam, where luckily KLM has direct flights. A great crew, attentive and the friendliest of other airlines I've flown. The only negative point remains that KLM charges a hefty price, as flyers on this route are captive (and mostly business travel). I would understand this if the Business Class cabin had already been renewed; but as the A330 fleet is the last to be upgraded and I would have found fair that, until these have been modernised, Business Class fares would reflect as the actual comfort level which is nowhere like the updated AF/KLM quality. Older seats and a slightly worn out cabin are a bit expensive to swallow when you have experienced the New World Business Class. Service is great but the configuration is just seriously outdated when prices are not!

### "this was a good experience"
❎ Unverified |  Amsterdam to Curacao on 11/02. Flight left with 2 hours delay, due to snow and de-icing procedures at Amsterdam, which was beyond the control of KLM. The new business class at KLM is a major improvement compared to the old style, yet the 2 aside seating still requires that your you have to crawl over your fellow passenger when seated in a window seat. The seat itself is spacious and transforms to a comfy bed. Unfortunately not much stowage space around the seat. IFE system is decent. We had a wonderful purser in business class, very friendly. The 'Indische rijsttafel' was without a doubt the best food I have had on a plane. We avoided flying KLM for several years as they were far behind vis à vis other airlines on their business class product but we did not have much of a choice on the Curacao travel, and I have to state that I was pleasantly surprised to experience that they have catched up. All in all this was a good experience, with an extra thumbs up for the food.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Düsseldorf to Amsterdam. Since I had no baggage for check-in I cannot review the check-in queue. However boarding commenced on time. The seat onboard the Embraer 190 was a bit tight, but this was not too relevant for me on a 25 mins flight. The legroom was okay as well. After taking-off on time, I was surprised that KLM provided food and beverages on a 25min flight. We were handed a muffin and a water, very convincing for such a short flight. I was satisfied by the friendly cabin crew and the pilots, who let me enter the cockpit after the flight and congratulated me since I flew on my birthday. We arrived 10 mins early. All in all it was one of the best experiences onboard an aircraft although the flight was just very short.

### "atmosphere was very pleasant"
A wonderful experience with KLM, which is our favourite airline. We booked a city trip from Vienna to Helsinki via Amsterdam with KLM. Everything worked as smooth as it can be. Fast and simple online checkin, on time departures of all four flights, cabin crew amazing. On the return trip, one of the flight attendants continued with us to Vienna and she was happy to see us again and we felt treated really special. The economy class service on KLM's short and medium haul is exceptional, and the shorter legs (VIE-AMS) we were served a tasty sandwich/wrap and hot and cold drinks, on the longer legs (AMS-HEL), we got a hot sandwich and two rounds of drinks. On the return flight they served a regular hot meal (pasta with tomato sauce) and a dessert. Transfer in Amsterdam efficient, arriving to C7 and departing from C8 was really convenient. For all flights, the atmosphere was very pleasant and the crew members looked like they enjoyed their work.

### "chaotic and I was disappointed"
Houston to St Petersburg via Amsterdam. The flight was scheduled to leave Houston at 15:35 and the day of the flight an email was sent out stating there would be a delay until 17:00, this was fine. The delay was "due to operational constraints", which I understood as issues with the plane's usual functions. At the rescheduled time of departure, one would expect that the issue would be resolved. This was not the case. The pilot was able to explain to us that one of the engines was having mechanical issues and an engineer would assess the situation. After an additional hour or so of delay it was decided that the plane was not in suitable condition to fly. I'm grateful for the discretion here. The passengers were asked to leave the plane and given no direction afterward. They offered hotel accommodation for out of town visitors as reparation. After exiting the secure area of the terminal the crowd of passengers could not find anyone to help us. I personally heard four contradictory statements on who to contact to reschedule the flight. After calling the number provided to me by an unruly ground worker for KLM, I was put on hold for a Delta helpline and the call was lost. The second time I called I contacted a helpful worker who rescheduled the flight for the following day. Overall I was looking forward to this experience and it was nice until we were asked to leave the plane. After we left it was slightly chaotic and I was disappointed.

### "won't fly KLM any more"
Singapore to Denpasar Bali. Seats configured 3x4x3 for Boeing 777 is crowded. Service also not nice, I asked for a coca cola, but I think they almost run out, so the crew asked me back: "why I don't know everyone asking for coca cola! I put my drone inside a hard shell case, then put inside the Rimowa metal luggage, but still break the controller, try to request for repair, but after sent a email then no response. I won't fly KLM any more.

### "seat very comfortable"
Fabulous flight with KLM flying from Newcastle to Mexico via Amsterdam. Seat very comfortable, lots of space. Excellent food, pumpkin soup was nicest soup I've tasted in ages, great service. Gift at the end of flight was a nice touch. Crown Lounge in Amsterdam is good. Highly recommended. Looking forward to my flight in June already.

### "staff who make the difference"
Amsterdam to Southampton is a 50 minute KLM Cityhopper regional flight. The Fokker 70 aircraft are being phased out by KLM and replaced by more fuel efficient Embraer 190/175's. Having logged over more than 140 flights in this aircraft since 2002, usually being seated in the front, I chose for this flight seat 15A, which has a view behind the wing and in front of the (rear mounted) engines in order to make a set of this typical "Fokker shots". This flight contained only 22 passengers and while boarding I was greeted by one of the FA's who wanted to direct me to a much more comfortable and less noisy seat than the seat allocated. I explained her that I chose these seat on purpose, which was OK for her, but she mentioned to me: "I will serve you a snack and a drink on row 11, which is more comfortable". (Row 11 on a Fokker is an exit row with extra legroom) Before landing she came again to me asking whether the fotos were OK? She told me that, after working som many years for KLM she still loves to fly! It is not the hardware but the staff who make the difference!

### "crew so polite and friendly"
Manchester to Amsterdam. I have never felt so welcome on an airline. This weekend was my first experience of KLM, and will be looking at KLM for long haul flights. Cabin crew so polite and friendly. The Amsterdam to Manchester flight (15 January) 16:25 from Amsterdam, crew were fantastic!

### "I will avoid traveling by it"
On Jan 14, I was flying from Los Angeles to Moscow via Amsterdam by Delta operated KLM (KL602). Because of the problems with engine, we had to land in Chicago. After this unexpected rupture of the flight, my friends and I had to wait for more than two hours to receive hotel vouchers. KLM personnel told us to wait outside of the airport for a free shuttle to get to the hotel, but the shuttle never arrived (we were waiting for more than one hour). We were calling and calling the hotel, but it never responded. After we took a taxi and reached, finally, the hotel, it turned out there were no vacant rooms for us there. The hotel's personnel sent us to another location (another taxi on our expense), and we were lucky to find vacant rooms there - it was about 3 am. Overall, it took us about five hours to have finally a rest after we landed. The next day, I found out that the route of my flight was changed - now, I had to take a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt and an Aeroflot flight to Moscow, Lufthansa assigned me a seat to fly to Frankfurt, but they could not issue a boarding pass from FRA to SVO saying that they are not partners with Aeroflot. So, until I arrived to Frankfurt, I did not know whether Aeroflot would take me or not, Thanks God, it did. I am shocked by how KLM mishandled the whole situation; it should train its personnel how to manage emergency issues in more effective ways. Before this trip, KLM was one of my favourite airlines; now, I will avoid traveling by it.

### "Flight was really nice"
Amsterdam to Helsinki. Flight was really nice, the staff was present and were making everyone comfortable with their attitude. The seats were correct for a European flight and the selection of beverage was really great. I really enjoyed as there was no major disruptions and I was feeling at ease.

### "100% worth it"
Flew KLM from Dubai to Amsterdam. Spent a few extra euros and upgraded to Comfort Economy seats. Better recline and a few cm of extra legroom. 100% worth it. Good food. Good inflight entertainment and excellent flight attendants. I am thinking of any reason to complain but honestly can't find any.

### "very good experience"
Amsterdam to Madrid. A very good experience. Very nice flight attendants, free drinks and snacks, basically everything you need for a reasonable price. Unfortunately I couldn't enjoy the comfort of having Wi-Fi on the airplane, nor was there any form of in-flight entertainment. The actual seat comfort itself was very good. The above average price makes up for comfort, free drinks and snacks and nice service. An airline that I enjoyed flying with!

### "my luggage was still in Amsterdam"
I flew from Amsterdam to Frankfurt with KLM, connecting with China Eastern to Nagoya via Shanghai under a single booking. Unfortunately, they didn't fly my check-in baggage along with my flight until I arrived in Nagoya. I was shocked that my luggage was still in Amsterdam when I already arrived. They ruined my holiday for the next 3 days where I didn't have my baggage back. I already contacted KLM, they just asked me to contact the final carrier that I flew with. The final carrier didn't want to take responsibility since KLM didn't flew my baggage for the next connecting flight. No compensation had been made by them meanwhile I was asked to pay for sending the delayed baggage by the final carrier.

### "Breakfast could be better"
Amsterdam to Cape Town. Cabin staff was nice and friendly. Breakfast could be better. The seat reclines a little bit more than economy. The service is just the same as in regular economy. The extra legroom economy comfort offers is OK. the service exists of several meals, snacks and drinks, all free of charge. Unfortunately no WIFI (yet).

### "modern renovated cabin"
Flew back from a business trip in Las Vegas, from New York JFK to Amsterdam with KLM. Very modern renovated cabin, they did a good job on this. The seats are pretty new and very comfortable. The new HD screens are really nice, way better than the old ones in KLM Boeing 747. Food was OK, and (alcoholic beverages are for free). Downside was, this plane was really loaded. I was lucky to book the last economy comfort seat. I think it was because the holidays in the Netherlands and a lot of people were flying back home.

### "Overall, a great flight"
We traveled with our family of six from Atlanta via Amsterdam on Delta and then from Amsterdam to Johannesburg on KLM, and were pleasantly surprise by many aspects of the KLM flight. We have read many negative reviews about KLM's new ergonomically designed seats but I have to give them credit where due. The seats were very comfortable and offer excellent legroom. I am 6'2" tall and had ample space in comparison with Delta's economy seats. The entertainment system on board was fairly new, all touch screens with an adequate selection of movies, music etc. to keep you busy on a long haul flight.I never find airlines provide you with "good food", but I was surprised by the quality of meals onboard, although we were only offered vegetarian pasta or meatballs for lunch. KLM can definitely improve in this area. Snacks were served throughout the flight and I found the snacks to be edible, unlike Delta airlines inflight snacks that normally consist of a green banana and a ham sandwich. Service is the part that impressed me the most. We were greeted by friendly upbeat staff. Throughout the flight the crew were friendly and polite. Great job everyone! Overall, a great flight!

### "customer service is appalling"
Geneva to Amsterdam. KLM is without a doubt one of the least friendly airlines I have flown and the customer service is appalling. The staff were rude and not understanding at all. When there was an issue on their side where they had not issued me a ticket and I sent a complaint in having to pay 75CHF to 'change my flight', they rudely responded that it was my fault that I "did not possess the correct documentation to fly". This completely shocked me as it is impossible to carry documentation which has not been issued to you As our plane was delayed due to weather conditions, many people were missing their transfer and tried to approach the cabin staff who cut them off and told them to see the person who would be waiting at the gate. This is not the way to treat clearly concerned customers flying home for the Christmas season. If you have a choice, avoid KLM. The service is subpar, the staff are unfriendly and should anything go wrong, the customer support is not understanding at all.

### "no staff helped me"
Belfast to Manila via Amsterdam. Flight ok. I was travelling with 18 months daughter and during my journey as any other mother on her own with baby needed help with getting on board. I was struggling with buggy to bring with me and so I've asked staff for help. No staff helped me, they all looked at me and not even smallest gesture in my direction. Then some gentleman helped me carrying buggy in which I am very grateful. I thought it was one off maybe they really didn't hear me. But on my return to Amsterdam few weeks later I needed a help again only to bring my buggy down to the bus. And again I asked staff if they could they help me out just to bring it down the stairs. Response was they don't deal with this kind of requests and she walked away. Bus driver heard that and stopped engine and came to help me out. Again lovely gesture from stranger. I hope some mothers will have opportunity to read this and reflect on perhaps changing airlines to another.

### "the seats were okay"
Amsterdam to Los Angeles with KLM. Flight in general was okay. Seats were in Economy Comfort Zone. Although the Boeing 747 planes are pretty old, the seats were okay. The IFE screens could be a bit larger like in KLM's Boeing 777/787. Food was OK, enough choice and alcoholic beverages are free.

### "cabin crew the best part of this flight"
My flight to Europe Houston to Brussels via Amsterdam with KLM was simply delightful, the seating upstairs, the meal, service on board and the shorter flight time were all perfect. Due to the strong tail winds we arrived in Europe an hour ahead of schedule, the seating was confortable especially the window seats as they allow for one to stick long legs (like mine) some what diagonal towards the cabin wall. The meal was served immediately after take off, the beef bourguignon was outstanding, it was paired with a very delicious red Spanish wine. The cabin crew was the absolute best part of this flight, so attentive without being overbearing, Always with a smile making you feel welcome. I got to sleep at least three hours and arrived well rested. In Amsterdam I visited the lounge on the Schengen side, I was somewhat hungry and the breakfast available was plentiful including fried eggs. My flight got to Brussels was only 35 min but the cabin crew was able to serve a delicious sandwich and a drink. This flight too arrived on time. KLM is a great choice and I highly recommend it.

### "the flight was comfortable"
Manchester to Amsterdam on 15th December. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. The flight was delayed by about 1.5 hours after we had boarded, due to fog in Amsterdam. This affected a number of passengers who had connecting flights and many of them missed their connections. Although this didn't affect me as I didn't have a connection, I highly impressed by the captain and crew were in handling the situation, ensuring passengers were kept updated and gave plenty of advice to those who had missed their connections. The flight was comfortable and a nice little snack was served mid-flight.

### "delicious meals for business class"
Flew on KL836 business class from Bali to Singapore. KLM is no doubt my most favorite airline, especially the helpful Facebook Team and the cabin crews. I was sick in Bali and cut short the trip by five days, I contacted the KLM Facebook team and ask for a date change (change my returning flight from 18 Dec to 13 Dec), I managed to get a fast reply and get on the flight on 13 Dec. I'm very impressed by KLM's service attitude, as they do their best to serve passengers. Onboard the flight, the 777-200 cabin was refurbished with the new World Business Class cabin, the seat and the IFE screen had been gorgeous. There are two choices of delicious meals for business class. And every business class passengers will get a little souvenir from the kind and polite crews. I enjoyed this rather short but utmost enjoyable flight, and it is worth the price tag for business class.

### "excellent service and customer care"
Rebooked onto KLM due to an AF equipment change on the Dubai-Paris route on 11 December. The Dubai based Air France / KLM team insured that I was looked after and that there was no issue with rebooking and placing me on another flight. I was extremely impressed with the professional and caring attitude of the entire Dubai based team where they were quite obviously busy with the change of aircraft. Excellent service and customer care.

### "cramped economy seats on 787"
Flight from Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi on KLM continuing to Colombo with Etihad. Flights were ok, noting special, though I was shocked how cramped the economy seats on KLM's new Boeing 787 are. And, due to fixed video screens one could hardly see it when fully reclined due to wrong corner of the position of the screen. Had again a strange experience at check in when the lady informed me that I might have to check luggage again at Abu Dhabi due to security. When I asked what she meant by 'might', she told she did not know sure and that I 'should ask in Abu Dhabi'. When I commented that I booked a KLM flight number and expected KLM could tell me what luggage procedures on their flights are, she mentioned just replied 'KLM is not responsible for your luggage'. I did not believe my ears. The first FA I asked did not know either but informed me later that luggage was checked through. Unfortunately the continuing flight was carried out as a regional flight by Etihad with a small A320, so sat for another 4.5 hours in a even more uncomfortable seat.

### "food is very delicious"
Flew on new KLM world business class cabin on KL835 from Singapore to Denpasar. The food is very delicious and the highly responsive touch screen IFE system offers a great variety of movies and music. The business class passengers are provided with a headset with noise cancellation. The captain and the crews are very friendly. The business class lavatory is cleaner than the economy class. I would highly recommend KLM for this route.

### "providing unhealthy snacks"
Rome to Hong Kong via Amsterdam. Overall a good company, however food on board is really bad. KLM is providing unhealthy snacks, and little or no options for vegetarians (only two meals available which were both meat based). On the way to Hong Kong I couldn't order a vegetarian meal and I was given just a cold cheese sandwich. Seats are not really confortable compared to other airlines and temperature onboard is always a way too cold.

### "very comfortable seats"
After my mediocre flight to Kuala Lumpur from Jakarta with KLM, this flight has give back my faith in the airline. Boarding in KL was fast and efficient. The plane was new with very comfortable seats and updated IFE. The food was the same, a small pie but this time the FAs were watching if the passangers need anything else. They happily give me two small bottles of wine which I greatly appreciate. KLM should apply consistent standards of service for all flights.

### "crew disappeared until landing"
I was surprised when I saw KLM flew from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur and decided to book a round trip ticket. The ticket prices were very reasonable, even below Garuda for that route. However, the boarding process was slow and chaotic because the boarding lounge was too small. Around 20 mins after take off, the crew served small pie which was quite tasty and beverages. However, after that they disappeared until landing. I had to walk to the pantry to ask for some water. I was shocked when I saw the FAs just doing nothing in the back while a lot of passangers needed help in the front. The entertainment system was old but adequate for short flight.

### "overall disappointing flight"
Good sandwich on the CDG-AMS leg with friendly crew. The AMS-IST leg which is 3h20 long was not agreeable. Just a small sandwich and one serve of drinks for the whole flight. No IFE whatsoever. KLM needs to install on board entertainment on flights longer than 3H, such as wifi, or IFE. Overall disappointing flight.

### "could not have been less helpful"
Stockholm to New York JFK via Amsterdam. Missed the flight to JFK from Amsterdam because the KLM connection was delayed due to weather. KLM could not have been less helpful. Declined to give us so much as a tooth brush. Basically said they had no responsibility. Fortunately we'd used a travel agency that did rebook us but we had to pay for 1 night in a hotel (without any luggage of course) We will never fly KLM again - a truly horrible experience.

### "utterly disgraceful"
On November 13th I flew KLM from Geneva to Panama via Amsterdam. The crew, quality of food, service and entertainment onboard were excellent. However, this afternoon I tried to check in online for my return flight, only to be told I was 'on standby'. Incidentally, KLM had not bothered to inform me of this themselves, despite having my contact details. I hold a confirmed ticket purchased last August. Angry protests via their Facebook page and over the phone have elicited nothing beyond 'come to the airport to find out your options'. That will take at least two hours and may be pointless, but since they will not confirm whether or not I will be able to take the flight before tomorrow evening, I have no choice. Also, because it leaves at 19,00, so if they do bump me, as they apparently intend to do, all other alternative flights will have left, and there will be no chance of getting away before 19th - at the earliest. My employer paid over 6500 Swiss francs for a business class seat on this flight, on this day. An utterly disgraceful way to treat customers, and sadly I cannot imagine any circumstances in which I would voluntarily fly KLM again.

### "flights were beyond bad"
I flew from Miami to Doha via Amsterdam in business class with KLM. Flight departs close to midnight. Inflight service begins with flight attendant question of "Do you want to eat or not? No menus, no idea what is offered. Service is grumpy and abrupt with no warmth or welcome. This continues on the next flight to Doha (and in fact on the return trip to Miami). All beverages are one-time only - refills are begrudgingly provided on request. Seats are most uncomfortable, video is provided on a tiny grainy fuzzy screen, and crew really does not care for or about the passenger. On the last leg, AMS-MIA, business fills up inflight with family, friends, and co-workers who get the care and attention of the crew. I could tolerate this (and have) on their shorter intra-Europe flights, but these 4 flights were beyond bad. Long-haul on KLM never again.

### "staff were very friendly "
Amsterdam to St Maarten. We were on the first Airbus flight to St Maarten with KLM. Upon arrival, we were given a water salute, which made this an even more special experience. The flight itself was perfect. The staff were very friendly and courteous. The food was delicious and we were given plenty of drinks and other snacks.

### "KLM inflight hardware is so bad"
I fly 4 or 5 times a year to Asia with Asian carriers to avoid KLM. This time no choice so had to take KLM or SLM from Paramaribo (Suriname) to Amsterdam. I expected a mature plane, but have to say that the Boeing 747 cabin and economy comfort seats were ok. Good recline and space feeling in a row of 2 in the front cabin along the main galley. Unfortunately the inflight entertainment system was horrible. The purser announced she had to reset the whole system twice, this ment that the first 1,5 hours basically there was nothing to watch. The food was extremely bad : chicken with sauce meant sauce with one tiny piece of chicken, and slimy rice. I did nit touch the breakfast which existed of among other strange things, a roll with an undefined stinking substance (egg?). Too bad that KLM inflight hardware is so bad, since the crew was extremely friendly and efficient. Felt pity for them that they have to work for a carrier that is economizing on everything.

### "it was a bad experience"
We just flew from Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam with KL450 and it was a bad experience. A we entered the plane it smelt, no TV's were working all the flight (more than 7 hours) and there was no apology or comment about it - in fact we all were given headphones, with a comment that adaptor was "complimentary". There was no information about where we are, what time, nothing - only at very beginning and before landing. The seats are small, and there were lots of very tall people and one of them from the seat behind kept of stretching his legs, constantly kicking me

### "crew extraordinarily friendly and efficient"
Dusseldorf to Amsterdam with KLM. I was positively surprised by the service on this flight. Boarding began on time, and the passengers were all on board quite fast. We took off a bit earlier than our schedule told us. I was not expecting any service from KLM on this short 25mim flight, but when the crew went through the cabin and served a muffin and a water, I was surprised. The crew itself was extraordinarily friendly and efficient. All in all the flight on board KLM'S E190 was very pleasant and I would definetly recommend it, as the flight is worth it's 100€.

### "an awful experience with KLM"
Dublin to New York via Amsterdam. My husband and I had an awful experience with KLM. We missed our connection to NY. Us and about 30/40 others. When arriving in Amsterdam we were just left to figure it out for ourselves. No guidance. Booked us on flight for the next day. Gave us a bag with a toothbrush. Told us we could not get our luggage. Put us in a hotel in the middle of no where. The KLM ground staff are rude. No one was helpful in any way. The flight staff were lovely. We were stuck in the very back of the plane. Totally cramped it was awful, but the food and staff were good though. On landing in NY we discovered one of our bags was lost. Our cab had to wait for an hour and twenty minutes while we made a lost baggage claim. Again. No help from the ground staff. No KLM staff available in lost baggage office. Got nasty Delta lady who told us it's a KLM problem. We at least got a reference number. So I just called KLM to ask when I could expect my bag. I was asked to ham up and call back as this representative's computer was down. I called back and was eventually told I could expect my back within 8 hours. Our bags were at the airport in Amsterdam for 20 hours! How can one bag not make the flight? Do not use KLM. If there is a problem they suck. And if you do decide to fly with them, upgrade your seat. Economy is for anyone 95 lbs or less.

### "I was very impressed"
The KLM flight from Durham to Amsterdam was just as you'd expect on a short hop, nothing out of the ordinary. The flight from Amsterdam to Bangkok was very good for economy, it was either a new aircraft or refurbished one. It was the best economy flight I have had and the seat was very comfortable. The inflight entertainment system was good, all touch screen, I was very impressed.

### "a pleasant flight"
A pleasant flight to Copenhagen from Paris via Amsterdam with KLM, both flights were on time. The airplane was clean, cheerful air hostesses on both legs of the flights. Within Europe only flag carrier airlines provide snacks thus served with sandwiches on both flights, can't complain. For the price and service offered I will consider KLM for further voyages.

### "seat pitch is mediocre"
KLM is overall a good airline. Ground staff and cabin crew are friendly and very capable. Aircraft's are clean and well-maintained. Customer service, e.g. via Facebook, is good. Frequent flyers are not always treated as such. Added value of being KLM Flying Blue gold or platinum only holds value at the airport (priority for check-in, security, boarding, baggage handling). Economy catering on China flight was not good. Food isn't very tasty so I often don't eat it and it is always the same on the flights into China, and the same on outbound flights. In-flight entertainment on KLMs 747s is limited. On KLMs 787 and renewed 777 choice is good. On the other hand the 747 seats are better (softer, wider) than the 787/777 seats. Seat pitch is mediocre.

### "disappointing flying experience "
Amsterdam to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. This was my first time flying with KLM and hopefully my last. This was by far the most uncomfortable, disappointing flying experience I have had. They lost my seat confirmation in comfort economy and was instead placed at the very back of the aircraft. My Vegan special meal request was also somehow lost so I did not get any proper meal. The seats are incredibly narrow and unpleasant. The gentleman beside me had a larger shoulder span than the seat itself so was intruding into my space (he was not a large man). I usually am a great sleeper on planes but wasn't able to sleep at all on the 12 hour flight.

### "uncomfortable, disappointing flying experience"
As a frequent flyer, this was my first time flying with KLM and hopefully my last. This was by far the most uncomfortable, disappointing flying experience I have ever had. They lost my seat confirmation in comfort economy and was instead placed at the very back of the aircraft. My Vegan special meal request was also somehow lost so I did not get any proper meal. The seats are incredibly narrow and unpleasant. The gentleman beside me had a larger shoulder span than the seat itself so was intruding into my space (he was not a large man). I usually am a great sleeper on planes but wasnt able to sleep at all on the 12 hour flight. I feel broken after that and I still have 1 leg to go.

### "plane in general was old"
Flew Houston to Hamburg via Amsterdam with KLM. The plane was very old, the entertainment system didn’t work, had to be reset for the entire plan, and still went out halfway through the flight. Clearly the crew were aware that it was a recurring problem. If you know your entertainment system is not working, you should disclose it in advance. Also, 8,000 points is not adequate compensation for it not working. If you listed a seat for sale and disclosed the fact that the entertainment system didn't work, you would have to offer more than an 8,000 point discount for someone to purchase it vs. a working seat. The plane in general was old, seats did not recline and return properly. The complete disregard for these obvious issues made me wonder what other, less visible, ways the maintenance of the plane was neglected.

### "straightforward and professional"
Round-trip Berlin to Bangkok return via Amsterdam with KLM. All flights on time, everything straightforward and professional. Friendly and attentive cabin crews, good catering, very good IFE. Comfort regarding "slimline" seats & legspace fair, but I would strongly recommend everyone 175 up to book a seat to the aisle (what I did). No comment on Wifi as did not use.

### "I was thoroughly impressed"
On my recent flight from Calgary to Amsterdam to run the Amsterdam Marathon, I flew with KLM, and as my first time flying with the airline, I was thoroughly impressed. The service was prefessional onboard the aircraft, and my needs were attended to. I was asked if I wanted to move to another seat to allow for a family with children to sit together. I agreed (I was originally sitting in a bulkhead seat for the extra legroom), and I was upgraded to Premium Economy! The flight attendant who asked me to move was very professional and was so helpful throughout the flight. The food onboard was very good, and I was impressed by the amount of legroom and recline in Premium Economy. I will be flying with KLM again!

### "very happy with trip"
Very happy with trip from Birmingham to San Francisco via Amsterdam on KLM. Food tasty, good beverages that were complimentary unlike US carriers who nickel and dime you if you want a G&T. Onboard staff with a smile. Quick baggage delivery, too. On the 45-minute flight from Birmingham to Amsterdam the crew served choice of beverage and a snack, while on connexion flight of 82" from SFO-PSP on Alaska, no one smiled, you could only choose OJ or water, and they started to prepare for landing 30" before actual landing so they could go back to their jumpseats and chat about their schedules.

### "lack of taking responsibility"
Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi. Checked in online a day prior to departure and arrived more than 2 hours prior to departure as advised by KLM. But queues at KLM "bags drop off" were chaotic and a complete disaster. Despite asking various KLM staff for assistance, we had to wait so long in queues that we arrived late at the gate. KLM staff had more pleasure in telling us that they were going to take us off the passenger list and offload our bags from the aircraft. Had to reschedule flight which cost of EUR3,000 - KLM doesn't care of course. They don't even want to investigate what happened. Appalling service and total lack of taking responsibility.

### "crew professional and polite"
It must be over 20 years since I last used KLM I travel this route often (London Heathrow - Amsterdam) but always with the competitor, check in at T4 quick and polite as was the fast track security. I used the sky team lounge which I like and possibly prefer to my normal BA lounge, boarding quick seat 1A on a clean looking 737-800 which was full in both classes. Departed on time only a short 1 hour flight (Actually marketed as a Garuda flight) a small meal with drinks served on route, crew professional and polite. Arrived on time in to Amsterdam, no difference really to my preferred carrier other than using T4 as apposed to T5.

### "very highly recommended"
We flew from Humberside airport to Montreal (for F1 race) via Amsterdam Schiphol with KLM.This saved the long drive to Gatwick, Heathrow or Manchester. I live only 15 minutes from Humberside airport so this was a bonus. We actually left my house only 2 hours before the flight. There are 5 flights a day by KLM to Schiphol from Humberside so it will fit into any connection time to anywhere in the world. I have travelled extensively in my life time with most of the large airlines but none felt as satisfying as this trip did. All 4 flights were by KLM and I found them to be a very professional, curtious. The cabin staff were very friendly and very helpful. I thought that the inflight food was accecptable. All in all it was a very enjoyable experience and am about to plan another F1 trip to Singapore 2017 using KLM. Very highly recommended.

### "quick and efficient flight"
Belfast to Amsterdam with KLM. Quick and efficient flight in what must be an old, but well maintained mini-jet. Check in and boarding were satisfactory and pleasant. Small snack and drinks served, by friendly cabin crew. Arrival was on time even after the usual long taxi, which was followed by a seemly equally long bus ride to the terminal. A good flight

### "best part were the staff"
I flew with KLM from Warsaw to New York via Amsterdam. It was my third year in a row when I have chosen KLM on my way to the US. Flights WAW-AMS-WAW on board 737-800 and 700. Aircraft were clean, snack and sandwich were served, quick flights, crew ok. Both flights on time. AMS-JFK-AMS. Both flights aboard B777-200ER. Aircraft were clean with very nice interior. Seat comfortable with personal IFE. Good choice of movies and music. You can use IFE on by touching the screen, the remote is not provided. Food was fine but last year it was a bit better I think. Alcoholic beverages available for free which is a great thing. The best part of the flights were the staff. Everyone was very helpful and polite. They were always smiled with personal attitude to each passenger. The most professional service I have ever seen on both flights. Always someone was present at the galley to help and serve passengers. They really made me feel comfortable and atmosphere was good. The staff behavior and kindness was the best part of my flights and because of this professionalism I will definitely choose KLM on my next trip.

### "KLM have got it right"
This was the best experience of travelling long haul economy class. The aircraft's were clean and comfortable but what made the experience enjoyable was the cabin crew and their wonderful service. They were friendly warm and delightful. Nothing was too much trouble and they were very visible throughout the flight offering water and soft drinks to combat dehydration. Our flight attendant was delightful. KLM have got it right. I had never flown with them before but they will now be my first choice whenever possible.

### "very cramped and a little outdated"
Flying KLM from Taipei to Amsterdam. The original flight scheduled for September 27 was cancelled because of typhoon hitting Taiwan, but KLM informed us even the day before (they cancelled the AMS-TPE flight as well) and they sent us new boarding documents immediately. As our schedule has been postponed for 24 hours, I contacted the KLM support via Facebook, which was very effective and friendly option of customer care, they even offered us another flight on the original day of departure with China Airlines, but we chose to stick to the original rebooked flight mostly because of the typhoon (the CI finally departed with a huge delay). The Facebook support also helped us arrange the seats we wanted to, very good way to communicate with customer! The flight itself was just OK. Their B777-300ER in the original configuration (no new economy class) feels very cramped and a little outdated, the seats are not very comfortable, IFE has a great selection of movies, but is very slow and only controllable via remote (which sometimes did not work properly). We paid a little extra to get the coupled seats in the rear of the cabin, and it was definitely worth it, but still for a 13 hour flight it wasn't ideal. Food was good, quite lot of fresh fruit and vegetables. But what made the flight awesome was the crew, they were just great. Smiling from the beginning to the end. After a small chat with us when they found out this was our honeymoon, they came with a glass of champagne for us and and a card, what a beutiful experience! So overall very positive, KLM's customer care is great, just watch out for aircraft type, because this B777 definitely isn't the most comfortable option.

### "subsequently excused themselves"
Our first experience with KLM was certainly not optimal, but they have their subsequently excused themselves. Hopefully this was a one-off less pleasant experience. We left with KLM from Brussels to Amsterdam Schiphol to switch to another KLM flight to Bangkok. At our first flight was already wrong: technical problem with the brakes, impossible to leave. After an hour delay we left, and we find out onboard the plane that just connections after 18h (we left at 17:45) were possible. We finally came to Amsterdam to 17h15, where we walked fast with the whole family (traveling with two children) to be told at the gate that we were rebooked via Kuala Lumpur. First of all, we have never asked this but eventually I assume KLM does this only with good intentions. Yet when we were at the gate with children and luggage, the plane was still there, and more people were still boarding and we were not allowed on the plane! KLM decided us to book via Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok, adding a lot of time to our booked journey. The reaction of the staff on the spot was not friendly at all. Eventually, we have to abide by their decision, we were not allowed on the flight, so we went back to the KLM information counter. There they confirmed we had an extra few hours waiting to catch the flight to Kuala Lumpur. When you take such a long journey with children and you book in advance your seats on the plane, we then discovered that we could not sit together as a group of 4, but the staff was able to keep us places 2-2 adjacant in the middle row with 4 seats and 2 seats next to us free so that we would have more space . How do you explain to me that we cannot sit side by side with 4 seats, but with two and two empty seats?Leaving Kuala Lumpur again a technical fault with our plane to Bangkok, again more than 30min delay. Finally arrived in Bangkok over 8hrs later than planned. Booked taxi had gone, extra costs, and less travel enjoyment. Once at home we reported in writing to KLM, who provided an immediate apology and compensation to help mitigate the negative experience. The positive must certainly be said!

### "Seats quite comfortable"
This was my first time flying with KLM from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. The air fare was reasonable if compared with Garuda or MAS. Boarding was fast and easy. Seats quite comfortable. IFE was great with updated content. Arrived 10 minutes early. However the food was mediocre. I believe a hot meal or supper will be more appropriate.

### "inflight service average"
Kuala Lumpur to Berlin via Amsterdam. Inflight service average. Attendants not that friendly. Food as expected for economy but the omelette for breakfast was dry and a little tasteless, and coffee seemed very low quality. Please supply milk instead of powdered creamer. Entertainment options acceptable. Easy to check-in online. No problems there. Premium economy seat had great legroom and recline. But you have to share the underseat space with the person next to you. So that is annoying. Who gets to put their bag there? I would use them again if the price was right.

### "very friendly and efficient staff"
This trip to South Africa was our honeymoon and KLM played a very big role in making this a very special trip. Besides the clean cabin, very friendly and efficient staff and good food we got champagne and a nice friendly chat on the way to Johannesburg. On the flight back flight attendants asked us how our trip was. Flights were very good and on time / ahead of schedule. Highly recommended.

### "worst flying experiences"
London to Istanbul via Amsterdam. One of the worst flying experiences I have bad. The staff at Heathrow were very rude, the ticket was sold without making it clear there was no luggage allowance so we had to pay extra. They had only two staff at the airport so we had to queue for a long time to get this done. The plane was delayed by 3 hours so we lost the connection. KLM also lost the luggage (which we had to pay more for!) In all I found their staff to be extremely rude, the service on the aircraft was appalling and they are unable to fly even 100 miles without having a several hour delay.

### "overall good value for the money"
Amsterdam to Los Angeles. Due to better pricing I used a Delta ticket to LAX, which gave me the inbound flight on KLM and outbound on Air France. KLM was great service, a good seat you can sleep on, good IFE and good food. No delays, nice lounge at AMS, efficient boarding, so overall good value for the money.

### "excellent boarding and flight"
Zurich to Amsterdam. Swift checkin at ZRH Checkin 2, excellent boarding and flight. Had 12F seat with double legroom, due to the fact that the seat directly at the emergency exit is missing. Only point to criticize was the plane piece of cake they were serving on a flight during lunch time. For me something salty would have been more adequate.

### "comfort seats ... a joke"
We have flown KLM twice, from Singapore to Bali return. We paid extra for comfort seats, but what a joke. The seats were offset so my tv screen was halfway between mine and the next seat (I was window). My husband was middle. The aisle seat had an armrest tv and tray because there were only 2 seats infront of us. My husbands tv was overlapping her space and his tray hit hers. More importantly, her tv totally blocked the row. It was a nightmare. On the 13th we flew back. Had paid extra for comfort and were seated several rows back, so didnt get them. Never again.

### "plenty of seat space"
Manchester to Johannesburg via Amsterdam. Excellent flight and service on both legs, good food and snacks served with additions if required. Both legs on time. Plenty of seat space and leg room in economy. Although the 3x4x3 layout of seats means if you choose a window seat it is difficult to move during the flight and disturbs the other two seats. Problem retrieving my bag was dealt with efficiently although this was not due to KLM but a passenger collecting the wrong bag.

### "friendly and professional"
This was my first time flying KLM. The flight attendants for the four segments I flew were friendly and professional. They served a small snack and drink for a 50 min flight between BHX and AMS as well as AMS and ZRH. They offered wine and beer as well. Certainly better than what BA offers. Good job KLM. Keep it up.

### "service on board was simply spectacular"
Flew KLM from Amsterdam to Montreal and this was one of the most pleasant services I have experienced. Even though the plane is not even two years old (and therefore very clean/crisp), this aircraft still features the old world business class. Since this was a daytime flight this is ok. The service on board was simply spectacular. KLM has invested a lot in the 'be my guest' program, to refocus staff attention on the well being of the customers anfd this is clearly paying of. After the meal service, slept for the remainder of the flight. The Delft blue houses are a unique gift, that adds a pleasant souvenir. Even though we left Schiphol about 45 minutes late. The captain made it up and ensured an on time arrival. I can recommend KLM to anyone.

### "my experience was just ok"
Amsterdam to Los Angeles. It was my first time with KLM, and overall, my experience was just ok. The general feel of the airplane was that it needs to be updated. The food was ok, the seat and leg room were ok (although the reclining seat was clunky and didn't work very well), the staff was great, but the entertainment part was definitely behind, and there were no plugs for smart phones or computers. First, they didn't provide ear buds. I came prepared and had my own. Even if you have your own, you need to ask for an adapter, precisely because of the age of their entertainment system. Their entertainment system is old (think probably from the early 90s). The colors on the screen were awful and you could barely see anything. I skipped all the major blockbusters in the selection, because watching them in such poor conditions would be ridiculous. The choice of movies was ok, but quite average compared to other modern airlines. On top of all that, my unit was not working properly for the whole beginning of the trip, and because of that, the call button for the staff was also not working. Eventually, I was able to grab someone from the staff and they had to reset the unit. All this to say that, although I would still be ok recommending the airline, it would be with some serious reserves. In an age when connectivity and entertainment have become such important things on a trip, they can ruin a whole part of your journey if they don't live up to modern standards.

### "seats are fine with good leg room"
I flew from Southampton to Amsterdam with KLM on a Fokker 70. We left and arrived on time and the aircraft was full. The Fokker 70 despite its age is a very good aircraft for these short routes, the seats are fine with good leg room. Served cake and drinks on this 55 minute leg. Crew good.

### "inflight entertainment system did not work"
Flew KLM from Dubai to New York JFK via Amsterdam. Check in was smooth and easy and departure was early. On board, we we were served a snack and prior to arrival in Amsterdam, a hot breakfast. Surprisingly, from AMS to JFK, the inflight entertainment system did not work at all. Two people seated next to me, I was in 29H, left. The cabin crew tried a few times to fix the issue but it was not solved. Thus, for the entire duration of the trip, I was without entertainment. I was told by an flight crew that she would come see me and document the issue. This did not happen at all. There was more legroom on the 747 compared to the 777 from DXB to AMS.

### "service was the best"
Osaka to Brussels via Amsterdam with KLM. Kudos to this airline for being so efficient and helpful. The Boeing 787-9 on KL868 was a treat. Nothing can beat the 1-2-1 seating. I was seated in 1K and my wife in 2K. Service was the best that you could imagine. What stunned me was that the lavatories were decorated in the Delft Blue House wallpaper which I think was a wonderful idea. An old B77W on the way back on KL867. However, this flight did not disappoint us because the service was better than on the leg coming in. And what a coincidence. Our chief purser was the same charming gentlemen as one week again. He remembered us and chit chatted with out during the flight. I love the Dutch service and Dutch hospitality provided to us. We will definitely travel KLM when we are going to Europe again.

### "crew were helpful but not jovial"
Flew KLM from Amsterdam to Taïpei. The B777 cabin was new and very well suited for a long-haul flight. I particularly enjoyed the inflight entertainment system, that was efficient with great choice of movies, music and games. Lot of languages were available, that's a good point. The seat was comfortable, but I noticed that there was no footrest. The inflight service was complete, with the crew serving short drinks and refreshing towels before to serve the diner (that always comes a long time after take-off on long-haul flights). Hot bread was also a good point. The only thing that I missed on this flight was the crews smile. Apart from a very nice steward, the whole crew were helpful but not jovial. I did not get any smiles.

### "service was to me of a very high order"
Flew from Cardiff to Beijing via Amsterdam with KLM. Left Cardiff at 10:25 arrived Amsterdam on time at 12:45. Good flight,  plane (Fokker 70) was comfortable, coffee and a small snack served, aircraft clean and cabin staff very good. Long layover at Amsterdam, nearly 5 hours for flight to Beijing, flight to Beijing (Boeing 747-400 mixed configuration) left on time, again plane was clean and tidy, two meals during the flight which I really enjoyed, seats were comfortable, watched a film on the video screen to pass the time, toilets were clean and tidy and the cabin crew were wonderful. The rest of the travel from Beijing to Beihai was with China Southern Airlines who are partners to KLM on this route and again there were no problems their planes were clean and tidy, food was good and some of the cabin crew spoke English. I was very happy with the flights and the service was to me of a very high order and I will certainly fly with them again, I have flown with KLM - China Southern 3 times now and will continue to do so in the future.

### "more than acceptable"
Flew Schiphol to Jakarta. KLM were the cheapest and had the most convenient flight times. All flights on time. Boarding and luggage dropoff at Schipol were effortless and smooth. In terms of inflight service I found it to be more than acceptable. Seat backs were good and overall 12+ hours in their seats did not feel unbearable at all. IFE was up to date. No complaints about the IFE. The flight attendants were always visible and very attentive. They keep you well stocked up with food and drink during the flights. Overall my experience was good and I would fly with KLM on a long haul trip again.

### "best described as business basic"
Both flights with KLM (Toronto - Amsterdam and Amsterdam - Shanghai) were on time and the lay-flat seats were comfortable, especially on the Amsterdam-Shanghai route where I enjoyed the single seat 1A, the best one on B747. The crew was courteous, but the food was mediocre and the amenities kit very basic (socks, eye cover, toothbrush, comb) even when compared to their close Skyteam partners (AF and AZ). Overall a positive experience, but best described as business basic.

### "a huge disappointment"
This was our first time traveling with KLM and it was a huge disappointment. I traveled with a second person and we bought our tickets a month before the date. We started at Baltimore and got assigned seats for our Baltimore to New JFK flight as well as the flight from New York JFK to Amsterdam. When we landed in Amsterdam for our travel to Stockholm we were told that we weren't guaranteed a ticket and that we had to fly standby. This made no sense because we had bought our tickets a month ago and because we checked in to all our flights more than 24 hours before the flight to Stockholm. After much drama and waiting, we ended up getting seats but not sitting together. After more than 24 hours of travel and hundreds of dollars spent on these tickets it was a huge disappointment to not be able to sit next to my partner. We definitely were not the last ones to buy the tickets or to check in at the airport. The staff didn't have a good explanation and while they were friendly and courteous I am not inclined to fly with this airline again due to their incompetent way of assigning seats. This was too stressful and there are dozens of other airlines to choose from. In summary I felt cheated - I did not get what I paid for when traveling with KLM.

### "was expecting more from this airline"
I bought a ticket for my business trip to the Netherlands from Athens with this airline, because it was the only available option. It is the first time I flew this airline. The tickets were not cheap and I was shocked to learn later that my ATH-AMS-ATH flight did not include checked baggage allowance. So I had to pack for cabin luggage. KLM is normal, good airline, but I was expecting more from this airline. For example, the meal service was only a small sandwich. I would use it again, but not as my first preference.

### "catering was above expectation"
Amsterdam to Athens. Check in was efficient, boarding well organized. this aircraft had two rows of business seat, with the middle seat blocked (making 8 in total), although a standard economy seat the seat pitch is extended and the recline is better. The flight itself was on-time and smooth, the updates from the flight deck only that was necessary. The inflight service was personal and abundant, they went the extra mile to make the service worth remembering. Catering was above expectation: drinks, a three course hot meal served on one tray and coffee and digestive. Drinks topped up regularly. After arrival our Priority tagged bags where swiftly delivered. All in all a good experience.

### "nice and fresh plane"
Dusseldorf  to Amsterdam - a short flight with KLM. Food was good and services were as expected good. In 40 minutes we took off, had breakfast and landed at Amsterdam. Cabin attendants were polite and did a good job. Nice and fresh plane, definitely worth the money. It's hard to say a lot about a short flight but I again was very satisfied with KLM and choose them for my next flights.

### "love to fly with KLM"
Amsterdam to Los Angeles and I always love to fly with KLM. Always great service, food is good and a great amount of available beverages. The Boeing 747 in KLM's fleet are old, you can see it in the entertainment system, but the movies and series they offer are great. Overall a great experience.

### "everything was transformed"
I used to avoid KLM - the planes were old, the service poor, Schipol is a zoo and while not bad there were usually plenty of better choices. This time I was flying from Muscat to Amsterdam with my dog and this was the cheapest routing. I was amazed, everything was transformed - the service was excellent, the seats reasonably comfortable (in economy so all things are relative), the entertainment system was good and the food was OK. Schipol is still a zoo but it is much better organized now too.

### "never felt so cramped in a seat"
Berlin to Mexico City via Amsterdam. I have always got great reviews from this airline so I was expecting the same for this flight. Schiphol airport is a great piece of engineering/architecture. Onboard attention was great, I told my steward that neither of the sound jacks were working , immediately he knew how to solve it and gave me an adapter, it seems that they have this problem because most jacks are already worn out. The entertainment system was horrible, the remote control was aside of my legs and with a really small seat every time I moved a little I unintended pushed a button. The system could not resume to the point in the movie I was at, instead i had to 4x 15 minutes to get to the scene I was watching. The space is incredibly limited, trust me, I have always flown Economy and have previous experience with trans continental flights but I had never felt so cramped in a seat. The only way I will fly KLM again is to at least ensure the aircraft is newer.

### "this was a nice flight"
Flew from Amsterdam to Berlin. Despite the fact that this was a small airplane and we were seated in one of the last rows this was a nice flight. The seats are very ergonomic and give some extra room even for tall people like me. The service was provided with a smile and the sandwiches where probably some of the best I have had on a short flight like this. Well done, KLM.

### "was a very pleasant flight"
Xiamen to Amsterdam was an excellent flight (KL 884) on 27th May 2016. The flight was operated by a new Boeing 787-9 (PH-BHE). We were personally greeted by the captain who told us that we would get a delay due to air traffic control. But although we left about half an hour later than scheduled, we arrived in time at Amsterdam. The service on board was great and efficient, cabin crew was very friendly and professional. The food was good, the business class seat comfort in the reverse herringbone seat is perfect for sitting, working and sleeping. The only thing which I didn't like was the airbag in the seat belt. It takes a lot of space and it is not fine for sleeping. But nevertheless, this was a very pleasant flight.

### "never experienced such discomfort"
Lima to Helsinki via Amsterdam. I flew out with Air France to Lima and all went okay the plane was nice, staff and food were great. On my way back I had KLM, it was a 12h flight from Lima to Amsterdam. Firstly, I didn't find earphones on my seat so I went to ask for them. The steward rudely replied that they will only hand these out when we are in the air. I enquired why and he said that in business and first they are on the seats and I'm flying in economy where they are never given out prior to departure. Weird that I have always had them before waiting for me (so did their sister air France). The worst aspect was the seat. Absolutely no leg space. I have rather average legs for a female and there wasn't enough space for them. And the seat did not recline. I fly on a weekly basis and annually board long haul flights multiple times and have never experienced such discomfort on a plane. Worst of all, upon reviewing the flight the reply to the complaint was to imply that passengers in economy get what they deserve when they don't upgrade to a better class. Unbelievable. At least own it KLM and apologize. Otherwise: boarding arrangements were terrible. Passengers were made to queue for an hour plus. Service on board was good though and plenty of food was offered.

### "quick departure and attentive staff"
Kraków to Edinburgh via Amsterdam with KLM. We were a group booking and arrived at Kraków and taken to a quiet check in area, very prompt and arrived on board. Good seating together as a group. Only disappointment was the snack served were not gluten free and myself and another in the group are Coeaclics. Good flight with attentive attendants. We arrived in Schiphol and had a two hours wait for our next flight to Edinburgh, again very quick departure and attentive staff.

### "staff were nice and planes were clean"
We had 2 really good flights with KLM from Amsterdam to Johannesburg and from Cape Town back to Amsterdam. Our plane was equipped with the "KLM New Economy Class" which means that the seats are thinner than usual and you will now have a touch screen with a brilliant entertainment system in front of your seat. You can also charge your laptop or mobile phone with an USB cable. As on our previous flights with KLM we really enjoy the food on the long-haul flights. The desserts, salads and also mains are always delicious (for plane food). The drinks are good and they offer you many times water, juice etc. The space between our seats and the front seats were quite spacious. I am 1.70m tall and my boyfriend 1.80m. The selection of movies is quite good. You will find recent films and all-time classics. We would always recommend the flight with KLM. Flights were in time. Staff were nice and planes were clean and comfortable.

### "a poor experience with KLM"
Sao Paulo to Amsterdam and a poor experience with KLM and their "new ergonomically designed seats". Sitting in the window seat, I felt pressed to the wall, by the passenger next to me, a normally built man. Whatever position I sat, resulted in contact with the passenger next to me. This was never a problem with the old, comfortable seats. They had plenty of space for normally built passengers. I attempted to sleep by standing for a couple of hours by the restrooms, but was not allowed by the flight attendant. The toilet seat was actually more comfortable than the ergonomically designed seat. I was also told that the seat widths are the same as earlier on KLM, which seems to be incorrect, after reading the reviews on this site, where so many others are complaining about the narrow seat width.

### "leg room was appalling"
KLM flight from Billund to Los Angeles via Amsterdam was delayed. In-flight entertainment didn't work (10 hour flight), and was not fixed despite many "tries" - and by "tries" I mean they restarted the system every time someone complained, which didn't fix anything. Leg room was appalling. Cabin was noisy. Food was mediocre. Would not recommend.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Flew Leeds Bradford to Amsterdam with KLM City Hopper. New plane, loads of leg room, snack served on both outward and return journeys. Staff very helpful. Good communication from flight deck. All in all a very pleasant experience - well done KLM. Our first flight with them, but will certainly use them again.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur on a KLM 5th freedom flight. I was pleasantly surprised. The aircraft, a 777-300ER, was one year old but looked immaculate and featured the new slim fit economy class seats with the latest IFE version. I found very interesting the possibility of chatting from your seat with somebody else on the same plane through the IFE itself. A full hot meal was served (good quality) along with two rounds of hot drinks and spirits. Cabin crew was nice and polite but I really do not like their uniforms. Frequent announcements from the pilots in English. Flight left Jakarta ahead of schedule and did land on-time. A 20 Kg checked luggage was also included into the cheap fare. Recommended: this is a very good option especially compared to the many LCCs that fly on the same route.

### "no seats for my family"
Amsterdam to Toronto with KLM. I got to the airport for a 9:45 am flight only to find out that the plane has been overbooked and there are no seats for my family. We are then informed that we have been changed to a flight at 2:45pm and now have to travel indirect to Toronto via Montreal. We speak to the supervisor at the ticket desk and he tells us that after we pass through security, there will be some meal vouchers waiting for us at the information desk. When we arrive at the KLM desk, they kindly let us know that our names are nowhere to be found on the compensation list. After about 1 hour of hassling over the vouchers we give up. Our family should have been back in Toronto early afternoon but instead we will be arriving well into the night. Thanks a lot KLM for all your courteous service.

### "complimentary drink and sandwich"
Prague to Amsterdam with KLM. Inbound flight was delayed a bit due to passengers checking in, but not showing up. Flight crew managed to arrive on time in Amsterdam though, so kudos for that. Standard KLM service, which is good. Cabin crew were not exceptional, but good in their service. We've received a complimentary drink and sandwich, even on a short flight like this. Overall feeling is good and happy to fly a quality airline for the same price on such a short flight instead of the dreadful low cost carrier.

### "inflight service was good"
Short (leisure) flight from Amsterdam to Prague (1 hour, 15 minutes) with KLM. We had a seat at row 19 in a 2-2 configuration. Seats are good and offer enough legroom, even for me (6'2"). Inflight service was as what to expect from KLM - good. Even on a short flight like this, you receive a complimentary drink and sandwich. Not overly enthusiastic and friendly cabin crew, but nothing to be negative about. Cabin crew served us well and made us feel welcome on board, which is the most important thing in my opinion. Flight departed and arrived on time. One negative sidenote, I don't like the fact KLM charges passengers for there bagage which need to be put in the hold. I understand it, since they are forced to by competition, but it's KLM unworthy in my opinion.

### "cabin crew is excellent"
CAG to AUH via AMS with KLM. My mistake was to take flights with such short connections. Outbound lost connection and inbound nearly lost the connection as the gates of European and International flights are on opposite sides and there's at least 20 min walk + passport control. With the congestion of high season passengers should make sure that they have at least 2 hours for each connection. This is the only fault I found with KLM. Short connections flights should not be sold in my opinion. Apart from this, I flew with the B787 Dreamliner, a different story of comfort in Y class. Meal (sweet and sour chicken) wasn't exceptional, but the snack (quiche) was quite nice. Cabin crew is excellent. Couldn't expect any better. WiFi is charged at almost $10 for 40 MB, which compared to what the Gulf carrier offer it's a rip off.

### "crew were very professional and friendly"
Very nice KLM flight from New York to Stuttgart via Amsterdam. Regarding the long-haul flight, the interior of the plane seemed very new, with very modern slim seats that still gave you the feeling of enough space. The entertainment system was modern and worked flawlessly - however, the choice of films was a bit poor in my personal opinion. The crew were very professional and friendly, the catering (vegetarian meal) average. All in all, compared to an already fine Air France flight to Chicago a week before, KLM seemed to offer a more professional and higher quality product. The short-leg on an Embraer175 from Amsterdam to Stuttgart only lastet 50 minutes and was uneventful, everything running smoothly.

### "seats were wonderfully comfortable"
An excellent experience with KLM from Toronto to Paris CDG via Amsterdam. From the bag drop to the lounge to the easy boarding process to the pleasant welcome on board. Lie Flat seats were wonderfully comfortable, IFE excellent and food was plentiful. A really tasty curry chicken with wine and after dinner drinks (and champagne upon sitting down) were timely and very filling. As was the breakfast served just prior to landing. Also, the flight from Amsterdam to Paris was quick and uneventful. A little warm on the flight though. A quick transfer time between flights went smooth. AMS has a quick transfer time passport control/immigration (ours was 70 minutes) line.

### "premium economy seats were narrow"
We flew with my family from Nairobi to Washington Dulles with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The Nairobi to Amsterdam route was an old out dated 747. The premium economy seats were narrow and no different than regular economy seats. The IFE was the old remote system. The food was average but the Flight attendants were very attentive which made the journey great. The Amsterdam to Dulles sector was a newer Airbus with all the news equipment and better seats in economy comfort.

### "Without doubt to be repeated and recommended"
Amsterdam to Santiago with KLM. I have not flown KLM business class before but decided to fly it when flying back to Chile. I was genuinely impressed. Great flat bed and the usual efficient and polite Dutch service. Food is never anything special on any flight but I was very impressed by the dishes although it was an either or choice. Without doubt to be repeated and recommended.

### "looking forward to more flights on the 787"
With the renewal of its cabins and now of its fleet, KLM definitely is in the lift. I had the pleasure of flying its brand new 787 from Osaka to Amsterdam and what a pleasure it was. The cabin lay-out is similar to what is found in other upmarket companies like EVA Air, with all the latest gadgets, including wifi on board. Checking in Osaka was standard, straightforward and fast, but the line for security was long. The lounge was nice and well-catered, but a bit cramped. Boarding was smooth and well-organised. The inflight service was excellent - good catering (both Japanese-based on the recipes of the famous Yamasato restaurant at the Okura in Amsterdam and western), and portions were copious. The atmosphere in the 787 cabin is very pleasant. However, staff hinted that there was little space for them in the pantries and that this hindered them in providing the desired service levels - not noted by me, at least. The flight departed on time and arrived 30 minutes early. With the upgraded cabin lay-out in its old 747s and its 777s, KLM is now scoring high among its European competitors. Transit at Schiphol airport was smooth. And at the end of the flight I was lucky that Delft bleu house 96 was on board, so I have my collection complete again. Looking forward to more flights on the KLM 787.

### "everything was really good"
I was a gold frequent flyer with AF/KLM (admittedly due to routes not out of choice) and my experiences of KLM were generally not great - particularly out of the Middle East - and I avoided them. However this last week I had to fly via AMS twice for the first time in 4 years and I eat my words. Everything was really good. The new dreamliner is excellent, the new AVOD is excellent, the food is good, the seats are good (for economy) and the customer service was world-class. In fact the only memory of the old KLM was the uniform. Now I'm not going to rush to transit via Schipol because it is so big but they have really massively improved their game

### "cabin crew were excellent"
Vienna to Amsterdam with KLM. The cabin crew, as on all my flights with KLM, were excellent but this early morning flight had an added bonus. When entering the plane, I could smell the delicious fragrance of freshly brewed coffee. It was served promptly at the beginning of the flight and was very welcome by this sleepy traveller. A thoughtful touch.

### "delightful staff on board"
Birmingham to Quito via Amsterdam with KLM in Business Class. Excellent flight throughout both outbound and on return. Delightful staff on board. Food in business was very acceptable and served at just the right times. Very comfortable seats with best pillows of any business class we have flown. Ground staff also excellent in each airport. Crown Lounge in Schiphol gets very crowded.

### "staff professional and courteous"
Johannesburg to Amsterdam with KLM. I find KLM economy very good. Seats are normal and economy is comfortable enough. Inflight entertainment is very good, it works, screens are big and touch screen. What really sets the airline apart for me are the staff. They are great. Professional and courteous. Food is good. All in all a very good experience and who I use to travel with to Europe.

### "kept sliding down my seat"
I fly KLM because I'm Dutch born, but after my flight with them from Amsterdam to Bangkok, I'm rethinking that choice. Their 170 degree seats are not for a 6' 2" person, I kept sliding down my seat. The meals are upscale economy meals, not what one expects in business class. My return flight was with Air France, although the seats are not much better, the meals made up for that. KLM might want to get together with their partner airline, and learn what business class meals should be like. Flying that route again in August, but NOT with KLM.

### "new cabin is very nice"
Buenos Aires to Amsterdam with KLM. The new cabin is very nice, with flat bed seats that are very comfortable, although already a little bit dated in comparison with other airlines. The flight attendants offer an extraordinary service, incredibly professional and warm. Food was ok. The amenitiy kit is a little bit poor for such a personalized service.

### "wonderful experience of KLM"
Quick weekend break to Madrid and a wonderful experience of KLM. The price was outstanding via a travel website. Ground staff, in Newcastle, Amsterdam and Madrid were  friendly, proactive and efficient. Onboard, cabin staff were possibly the most friendly I've encountered. They couldn't do enough and  never seemed harassed. The seats were more than adequate for 2-3 hours. On the shorter Newcastle sectors we were served a small cake and a drink, and the longer hop to Madrid a hot pizza. Bags were rapidly delivered. They were trialling the new AirFi system on the Madrid route - it wasn't internet access, but streaming entertainment, games and news loaded on which you could access with your wifi device - a great idea. Amsterdam was easy to navigate (much more than CDG or LHR). The transit into/out of the Schengen area  without any  queuing. Schiphol itself is a lovely airport (but I can't understand why literally every shop/bar/eatery closes at 2100)!

### "flight attendants very nice"
Amsterdam to St. Maarten. I had a little doubt about the old Boeing 747 but I was wrong. This airplane is very well maintained, entertainment is up-to-date and the food and beverage selection were great. Also flight attendants were very nice and easy going. I'm going to be choosing KLM in the future.

### "do not have a competitive product"
Guayaquil to Lyon via Amsterdam. It has been the first time I flew Business class on KLM and my experience was somehow disappointing mainly because of the seat confort and the disappointing onboard gastronomical experience. Very surspisingly KLM didn't offer on this 11 hour flight a full flat seat which should be a standard today for a 4 star airline. The seat did not completely recline in horizontal position, which made sleeping very difficult and unconfortable. As I complained to the cabin crew, they told me that on various KLM planes there are still the old business class seats (as the one I was in). So, be aware when booking KLM business class because you could experience a very unconfortable night flight without much sleep as I had. I also found the catering experience disappointing. The food quality of the main course was not good, meat was dry and hard. It looked like an economy class meal, just heated up and presented in nice porcelane. I don't like neither the way food was served in business class as flight attendant serve it from the usual economy class trolleys and they still serve you a plastic (I guess it was hard plastic) tray on your table. I found it a real lack of class, KLM should really improve the way they serve this dishes to its guests in the business class. The quality of the coffee served on board was undrinkeable. IFE should be updated to todays standard. Its not user friendly, it looks old and the choice could be better. The staff is very friendly, helpful and caring about its guests, they really like to interact with the passenger. The quality and personnality of KLM flight attendants is probaly what makes KLM so unique. On the short leg from Amsterdam to Guayaquil everything was perfect. A good and tasteful light meal was served and again the staff was very nice and caring. VIP Lounge in Guayaquil is of really poor quality. It looks old, somehow dirty, food choice is not that much great as there is a lot of junk food and you have to pay for alcoholic drinks. However KLM offers a welcome beer or a glass of wine to its passenger which is very appreciated. To summarize I would say that KLM has a very good product for shorthaul and transatlantic economy class whic defeats many of its competitors. However KLM should really speed up in updating its Business Class experience because they do not have a competitive product today. For me it was not good value for money.

### "quality of food was good"
First leg Lyon to Amsterdam on time, fast boarding, tasteful snack and drink on board economy class, friendly staff. Second Leg from Amsterdam to Guayaquil. Very fast and efficient boarding, comfortable seats. IFE is ok but should be renewed because it does not offer that much choice as other airlines, I didn't find the IFE that user frendly either. The staff was friendly and caring about its passenger, great service for economy. More than enough food was served, plenty of drinks were served through the flight. Quality of food was good. KLM flight attendants know how to care about its guests making that long trip more enjoyable.

### "FA's were very professional"
Swift, on time, comfortable flight from Chicago to Amsterdam with KLM. FA's were very professional with good quality of foods and drinks served. The IFE in the 747 is a bit dated in Economy Class, but the seats are nonetheless quite comfortable. Really like the way KLM tries to do a bit extra on the design side of the meal boxes, stewardess card with by adding a bit of "Delfts Blue" Dutch design.

### "staff friendly and professional"
Bangkok to Amsterdam, and my first time to Europe with KLM and it was a pleasant one. I am not a fan of a long haul flight but 12 hr flight with this airline made the time flew fast. Staff were friendly and professional. Food and drink were plenty throughout the flight. The seat with decent legroom and entertainment is ok. KLM is my first choice for Europe.

### "seat is very relaxing"
Flew on the new World Business Class on KL836 for my flight from Denpasar to Singapore. As a fan of KLM, I decided to purchase an upgrade to business class. The legroom is big and seat is very relaxing. Meals and drinks are served during this 2 hours flight. The cabin crew are very welcoming to every passengers. I will definitely choose KLM for my next trip.

### "expected much better"
Went for a weekend to Prague and chose KLM for the flight time with connection in Amsterdam. The aircraft looked dated and their system to make people pay to chose a seat is rather annoying, plus pay extra for checking in a bag too. Inflight service is a joke, a microscopic bag of crisps and tea or coffee. For the price I paid expected much better. Connecting in Amsterdam was chaotic, the line for passport check was so long that myself and many other people had to run to catch my next flight.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Amsterdam to Dubai with KLM was an excellent trip, on time, comfortable and extremely attentive friendly cabin crew. Genuine welcome on board, prompt response to any requests. New lay flat bed a dream - no sliding onto the floor when you nod off ! In-flight catering also improved and well presented. Only slight irritation was the IFE - not very intuitive and the selection of music and films is well behind other carriers, not really an issue for me as I always travel with my own music but could imagine that it could be a disappointment when compared to other airlines travelling into this region. I will be back soon.

### "seats very narrow"
Pleasant flight with KLM from Johannesburg to Amsterdam, on time with good service from crew. Seats very narrow in economy class and limited recline. The seating arrangement of the 777 of 3/4/3 is not good for people in the 3 area as each has to disturb the other to move out of the seat and climb over each.

### "would recommend KLM"
Flew KLM from Singapore to Bali on a Boeing 777-200ER with a refitted cabin. The legroom was good, and the IFE offers music and movie choices. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful and food delicious with two drinks services on this 2 hour flight. I would recommend KLM.

### "pretty tasty food"
Vancouver to Barcelona via Amsterdam with KLM. I've flown with KLM for years, and I always choose them. I have never had a delay, customer service is excellent and the inflight entertainment is abundant. I never had problems with airline catering, and KLM always has pretty tasty food. The food and beverage carts seem to always be coming by so I'm never hungry or thirsty.

### "crew were very professional"
Excellent flight on KLM B787-9 Dreamliner (PH-BHC) in business class seat 3A from Amsterdam AMS to Xiamen XMN (May 10, 2016). Boarding was very efficient, a pre-departure drink and amenity kit were offered and we departed just on time. The Zodiac reverse herringbone seat was very comfortable, both for sitting and for sleeping. The crew were very professional and friendly. Both the dinner and the breakfast were OK. This was my 100th flight overall and when I told this to the crew I got an extra amenity kit and they did all their best to make this flight an unforgettable experience. This flight was fantastic and I can highly recommend KLM! I am looking forward for the next KLM-flight.

### "service onboard was swift"
Curacao to Amsterdam was my first experience with KLM's New World Business Class. This new interior looks decent. However I think that the screens for the entertainment system were a bit small for a business class. Moreover the resolution of the films in the entertainment was quite low, and compression artefacts were quite often very visible. Between flights cleaning wasn't satisfactory: tray had coffee stains and on the floor at my seat I found a crumbled cookie. However the service onboard was swift and the attitude of the attendants was warm and professional. Despite the fact that all seats on the upper deck were occupied, I experienced  a comfortable, relaxed flight. KLM baggage handling at arrival was also very fast. I never left Amsterdam airport, after a transatlantic flight, so quickly.

### "chaos with overbooked flight"
London to Amsterdam. Appalled by KLM chaos at Heathrow this evening with an overbooked flight at 20.25. Later, on the flight not allowed to bring on any trolley bags unless gold or platinum members! Checked their luggage policy and am allowed hand luggage of the size I have. Get on board and empty lockers!

### "no more KLM for our family"
Flew with my family from Curaçao to Amsterdam. Very good and friendly wheelchair assistance at Hato. Nice new world business class KLM. Great seats, spacious cabin, very friendly crew. Regular food was ok/good, gluten free food wasn't gluten free (both of my daughters were sick during the flight!) and was poor in both quantity and quality if you compare it with the regular food. No gluten free desserts, no snacks whatsoever on a 9 hour flight. So if you need to have gluten free food I strongly suggest that you bring your own. Wheelchair assistance at Schiphol was a complete chaos. It took them more then an hour to bring us from the plane to the bagage claim. 3 pieces of luggage were broken + our 2 own wheelchairs were damaged (third time in a row with KLM!) Filed a complaint at KLM Customer Care, damage to luggage and wheelchairs will be paid by KLM. As a compensation they offered me a ridicoulous low amount KLM vouchers which I didn't accept and then the CC case manager decided to close the file. Apparently KLM doesn't accept any response from their passengers. So no more KLM for our family.

### "excellent service, meals delicious"
Amsterdam to Toronto with KLM. Excellent service, meals were delicious, snacks, breakfast, very nice. Seats were comfortable, nice entertainment with a lot of selection. At 6,2" there was plenty of leg room. Clean aircraft with excellent friendly staff that flew us to our destination on time. Landings, flight, and communication by the pilots was excellent. Will fly with KLM again - highly recommended.

### "crew was extremely cheerful"
Madrid to Amsterdam with KLM. Flight was a connecting flight from ACE. After spending some time in their lounge at MAD using our PP, we boarded the flight. With an evening flight, the plane is well maintained. The crew makes and could break the flight as we have experienced the last couple of years flying KLM. This crew was extremely cheerful. The flight was full. Service was a sandwich. No choice. The full service included alcohol, sandwich and coffee was ok. Arrived on time. Our national airline has a great service. This crew really did a great job.

### "SkyPriority worked well"
Toulouse to Amsterdam with KLM. This flight, was operated by KLM but booked on the AF website. Check in was via the Air France Mobile App - although it looks different from the KLM App is identical in use. Toulouse provides SkyPriority for Business class and Flying Blue Elite passengers which worked well. Although they have a lot of flights out of Toulouse, Air France does not have its own lounge and uses a contractor lounge which was absolutely fine. Boarding was 10 minutes late, without any communication from the ground staff. SkyPriority boarding was strictly enforced. The onboard service was typical KLM which is OK as was arrival in Amsterdam. All in all it does not matter whether you fly on a KLM or AF ticket, service is 100% aligned, only uniforms and languages differ.

### "partly good, partly bad"
Manchester to Bangkok via Amsterdam with KLM and partly good, partly bad. Flight from AMS to BKK was on a geriatric B777. The 2-3-2 configuration led to a feeling of being overcrowded. Food was mediocre at best and not all options were appealing. On the return journey no menu cards were available. The excuse was that they had not been loaded. I was still able to get some sleep as the seats were not uncomfortable. The great appeal of KLM is the staff who go the extra mile and are always accommodating. Not good value for the price I am afraid and my next trip I shall revert to Qatar Airways.

### "problem was organisation in Bordeaux"
Flew KLM from Bordeaux–Mérignac back to Amsterdam, and onboard staff is great, aircraft is on time and arriving at Schiphol was stress free. The only problem was the organisation in Bordeaux (where AF-KLM is supposed to be intergrated but here not at all. First you go all the way to 1 end of the airport for check-in (the AF area), then you are sent all the way accross to the other end. There, 45 min queuing for security as there is one lane and no Sky Priority. Logically KLM flight should be handled with the AF terminal, where all is clear. After 45 min waiting the gate is not indicated, then you reach the gate where the personnel moves to another one (just telling a few pax around). At the gate, the AF personnel did not bother organising the flow, did not set the Sky Priority lane and just boarding randomly. KLM handling in smaller airports left to AF is just not up to the standard. Although there is an obvious cost saving involved, the Sky Priority service should at least be organised properly.

### "flight was punctual"
Amsterdam-Oslo and back with KLM City Hopper. On checking in for the outward journey I was not given the seat I had requested when booking. Not the first time this has happened. Why bother asking a passenger which seat he/she wants? The plane was not at the pier and the passengers had to take a bus to the plane. Comfortable seat with enough leg room. Flight was punctual. Snack was a slice of cake and coffee/tea. On the return journey I was allocated the correct seat. Again the flight was on time. The snack was a wrap, not very nice. Againt transported by bus to the terminal building at Schiphol. The cabin crew were correct both journeys but the bright red KLM regulation lipstick for the ladies clashes with the orange in their uniform.

### "crew friendly and helpful"
KLM Rio to Amsterdam on a brand new Boeing 787-900 with large inflight entertainment screens. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Flight arrived early in Amsterdam. The food out of Rio was good. Two hot meals served. On departure dinner and on arrival a hot breakfast with fresh fruit salad.

### "seat was very comfortable"
Flew on KL809, a fifth freedom flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. The check in process was smooth, flight was on time. This B777-300ER PH-BVN is equipped with new economy class cabin, legroom was big and seat was very comfortable. The IFE system offers variety of music and movie choices. Hot meal and drinks were available. We arrived Jakarta on time. This was my first experience with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the experience was very impressive, I appreciated the fabulous service from the crew and ground staff in KL and Jakarta. I will choose KLM next time.

### "extremely unhappy camper"
Chicago to Nairobi return via Amsterdam. Many times there are 2 or 3 adjoining empty seats which would allow a tired customer to lay down and get some well deserved shut eye, except you cant lie down because the armrest only folds up about half way (45 degrees). This stupid armrest design is obviously been chosen to prevent passengers to lie down. Most airlines flying this aircraft have fully foldable armrest. I flew on Emerates on the same route last month and was happy to see foldable armrests. In another matter, I was told at the gate the Nairobi to Amsterdam flight was completely full, but there was one seat available in business and I might be lucky to get upgraded. I was seated in one of the best economy comfort seats 17C. Great, after take off the stewardess approached me saying she can offer me a more comfortable seat. Having flown extensively with KLM over many years, this normally means an upgrade to business. I took my stuff and followed her only to be shown a seat behind the bulkhead, which had absolutely no foot or wiggle room. It was one of the worst seats on the plane with a crying baby right next to me. When I tried to get my great 17C seat back it was already occupied. I spend the rest of the flight of about 7 hours standing up and walking around. Needless to say I am an extremely unhappy camper.

### "a nice airplane"
Amsterdam to Rio de Janeiro on KLM Boeing 787-900. A nice airplane with big personal entertainment touchscreens. Very helpful and friendly cabin crew. Meals are tasty and of a good quality. KLM seats are not better or worse than Emirates or Qatar Airways.

### "made one feel very welcome"
Amsterdam to Toronto with KLM. Experienced the new Business Class seat which was, for the most part, satisfactory. The actual seat is comfortable. Screen is large and makes for good viewing. However, there is very little space to put anything (books, glasses, small bag, etc.) and the headphone needs to be connected to a plug that is located in an awkward spot behind one. There is also little privacy, other than an odd looking 8 inch high screen. Food was OK and the snack prior to arrival most enjoyable. The crew were great and made one feel very welcome. Service very good.

### "transported us from A to B"
KLM short-haul Cityhopper flight, from Amsterdam to Bergen. We checked-in via the KLM app and received pre-booked seats in Economy Comfort. These are the rows behind business class and offer more leg space, the service is just standard economy. These seats are bookable free of charge for Flying Blue Elite cardholders. Luggage drop off via the Skypriority entrance was fast and efficient and the lines for security check were shorter than the other lines. Breakfast choices in the KLM Crown lounge are 365 days/year the same, but OK. Boarding smooth, Skypriority was enforced. When boarding was completed the aircraft remained at the gate for 10 more minutes allowing them to load the last transfer luggage, making sure that all passengers arrived in Bergen with their luggage. Cabin service consisted of a sandwich with coffee and a 2nd drink. All in all nothing special, KLM transported us from A to B and this is what we expected them to do.

### "an incompetent airline"
Our flight was delayed from Paris to Amsterdam, and when we arrived in Amsterdam, our connecting flight to Manila had, us so we had to spend an extra night in Amsterdam. The customer assistant made a comment that we should have just taken an earlier flight if we had an important thing to do the next day. How unsympathetic! Then we were told to get a voucher for the hotel where we would be staying at and had to wait for a shuttle in the cold which took almost an hour. When we arrived at the hotel, we found out that it was under renovation and didn't even have the proper amenities for a hotel. To make things even worse, when we arrived in Manila, 1 of our checked in bags was missing! Such an incompetent airline! I will never fly with them again.

### "food selection has deteriorated"
London to Hong Kong via Amsterdam. I was happy with having a seat both directions on the upper deck in general the service was friendly and efficient. The food selection has deteriorated. Far too much attention to Chinese options because of the Asia focus. As an example the return journey had beef on three places within the menu. No specific choice for vegetarians The Chinese meals were formulated in small narrow dishes which left you feeling empty. There has definitely been a cutback in the quantity of food provided. Unless this changes then we will turn to another airline. I am always advocating KLM but not with this radical menu options.

### "onboard service pretty poor"
San Paulo to Manchester via Amsterdam. The Boeing 777-200 was the new KLM business class. Still light years away from many modern airline business class seating (CX/EK/EY etc). However, the seat is much better than the previous KLM product and the headset even plugs in at shoulder level, rather than low down in a corner. Marginally improved personal space than the old style. Onboard service pretty poor, food and drink limited. Hot towels were cold, Hot rolls were cold, even the coffee was cold. Many items missing from meal tray. Food trolley prepared far too much in advance of service. Given that the service outbound was fantastic, this inbound leg to AMS has very disappointing. The "new" amenity pack was still basic, but contents are of poorer quality than the old. The socks already unravelling & the toothbrush bristles fell apart when used. Hardly premium product for premium class. The crew on the short flight to Manchester were friendly and helpful for the short connecting flight.

### "the worst business class seat"
Manchester to Lima via Amsterdam with KLM. Very friendly cabin crew on both legs. Old style business class seat on the Boeing 777-300, which is probably the worst business class seat I have used for many years. Truly uncomfortable. The headset socket is in the most awkward position, where you have to kneel on the floor to insert it. The amenity pack is very basic with socks, eyeshade, ear plug and toothbrush. Food was OK, but could not fault the very attentive service. Inbetween meal snack availability pretty basic too. Both flights on time. For longhaul the seat was diabolical. Hardly any personal space.

### "cheapest business class ever"
Little do people know that on this particular route from Singapore to Bali (vice versa), KLM offers just about the cheapest business class ever! I had little expectation of the standard and service, I was pleasantly surprised and reassured that all is good with them. Cabin crew were very friendly and spoke fluent English, seats are angle flat which is perfectly fine for a 2 hour flight. Meals and drinks are plenty and of good quality. Inflight entertainment is great too, very impressed with the extensive CD library. The finishing touch was the souvenir BOLS alcohol filled little Blue Dutch ceramics houses for every J class passenger. This flight gives me confidence of flying with them in future from Asia to Europe.

### "stuck eating a vegetarian meal"
Vancouver to Tel Aviv via Amsterdam. Was very disappointed when they were bringing out the dinner. After serving only three rows, then got to me and they tell me that they ran out of the "meat meals" - only vegetarian! How does that happen? That means that half the aircraft didn't get the meal they wanted and got stuck eating a vegetarian meal that was absolutely sub par! Bland and just nasty. I really don't understand how a airline can stiff half the aircraft's passengers with one of the most importent parts of the flight, the food. It makes people calm after they eat what they are meant to eat. I was steaming mad, no compensation was offered in any way.

### "feel respected and appreciated"
It was such a joy to realize that Bali to Singapore has a KLM route and that business class is so affordable. Captain walked through the business class cabin, looked a little tired and dour, but thought nothing of it. The replacement crew for the Singapore to Amsterdam leg was seated in business class with us, creating a sense of calm and well-resourced and relaxed crew. Seats are the new World Business Class with full flat bed. I didn't use that feature, but definitely clicked it down to about 60 degrees to rest after my third glass of wine. The cabin amenities are great. Good food. Wine selection is incredible. I chose an Argentinian red that really kept its spice at 35,000 feet. Weather looked like we should expect quite a few bumps, but we emerged from 10,000 climbing out of Bali and captain immediately took off the seat belt sign and we cruised along quite smoothly and silky for most of the two hours of level flight. There was one moment of lightning and big hammer tops, but captain and first officer artfully wiggled around them picked up speed and got us into Singapore 35 minutes ahead of schedule. Cockpit messages were brief and not very informative, but that's okay. Professional and cool and was happy that they were clear and gave all the details about arrival and weather. For the most part this is just a lovely luxury shuttle from Bali to Singapore. I felt relaxed, calm and really satisfied with the service. I've used it three times since I learned about this route. Something about being in those big blue planes makes you feel respected and appreciated. Cabin crew was great and ratio of passenger to flight attendant was good. Each member smiled and paid attention to my needs and gave me one of those little houses they give to each passenger. I will continue to fly and I have even signed up to their frequent flyer program, Flying Blue.

### "excellent customer service "
Leeds to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam return, and a very good experience with KLM. We experienced very good customer service from the KLM social media team who resolved an issue with a inexplicable change to our inbound flight very quickly, and they were extremely responsive and helpful. The outbound flight was very good - we found there was more leg room than on a lot of flights. The entertainment was excellent with latest movie releases and good TV system. The staff were efficient and food was fine. With our inbound flight, we received an email 24 hours before the scheduled flight time stating that our flight from KL to Amsterdam was delayed by 4 hours - meaning departing at 0320 and missing our connecting flight from Amsterdam to Leeds - not good. The email stated nothing about what KLM were going to do about this, so we immediately phoned the customer service team. The lady we spoke to very quickly made alternative arrangements for us - by booking us on a completely different flight with Malaysia Airlines to London and then BA from London to Leeds - this solution meant departing at the same time as the original booked flight, and getting back to Leeds slightly earlier than with the original booking - so we were delighted with this solution and the way it was arranged so promptly, with email confirmation coming through straight away. Our only gripe is that fact that the original email was lacking in information and we had to call the customer services team rather than them proactively communicating the alternative option to us. All in all I was impressed with the quality of the outbound KLM flight and the excellent customer service received at various points throughout our experience with this airline.

### "disappointed by old business class"
Bangkok to Amsterdam on a Boeing 777-300, very disappointed by the old business class, quite crowded, and by the lack of honesty of KLM. When you book your trip, the plane type is indicated with a hyper-link, which brings you to their new 2-2-2 business class, whereas the one actually flown is 2-3-2. Entertainment system is good, but you need excellent eyes to be able to read what is on the screen from your seat. Food was excellent, service attentive, choice of wines decent if not overwhelming (the surprise being a Dutch white wine). Boarding and deplaning were fast and efficient and on-time

### "continued to go downhill"
Chicago to Amsterdam with KLM. Overall, from checking in to landing it was a poor experience. The food was awful and condescending cabin crew. As an airline, KLM have continued to go downhill for the last ten years, and they are now a long haul budget airline with full fares. If flying to the USA try Delta.

### "an excellent flight"
Superb service on AMS-SFO (had a short FCO-AMS leg earlier which was fine) and one of the best transatlantic flights I have taken. Firstly, quiet with minimal announcements. Attentive, pleasant staff and service throughout flight - friendly cabin crew. Food and drink were plentiful and of good quality. Since we were flying daytime the angle-flat (170deg) seat/bed was sufficient. Plenty of films including very recent releases. All in all an excellent flight.

### "not a pleasant experience"
I booked a business class flight from Heathrow to Accra via Amsterdam. Not a pleasant experience. I checked in early, had my seats confirmed for both legs of the journey and turned up to the Gate to be told there was a problem. The check-in guy took my boarding pass and, after a few minutes gave it back to me saying the problem had been solved and that I could board. I had the same seat on the first flight, but did not look at the second. Big mistake. They had put me on standby despite me having checked in earlier. When I got to Amsterdam I was told the flight had been heavily oversold and there was nothing they could do. I went to the gate to find total chaos. Loads of people were without seats and they were asking for volunteers to miss the flight. In the end, after much argument I got an Economy seat. I have sent two emails to KLM customer service but with no reply. I got sent a completely incomprehensible automatically generated email which nobody I show it to can explain. So, here I am - initially chucked off the flight, paid for Business class and got Economy and no response to my emails. What rubbish customer service. I fly long haul continually for business and will make sure I do not use KLM again.

### "one of the best flights with KLM"
Amsterdam to Taipei, and experienced one of the best flights with KLM so far. Ground staff at check-in were efficient and helpful, gate supervisor showed excellent customer service. Cabin crew professional and efficient, welcomed on-board and directed to seat and crew introduced themselves. New Business Class seats spacious and provided privacy. In-flight duty free shopping has a nice assortment. A nice touch that KLM still provides In-flight duty free shopping and pulling out the sales cart into the cabin.

### "good value for money"
London to Kansai via Amsterdam, and all in all a great experience with KLM. Flights on time; cabin crew were charming, the lie-flat bed in the new World Business Class was very comfortable and video screens huge, with a good choice of films and TV shows. The food was ok: on flights to Japan the choice is between 'western' and Japanese dishes - so not really a very good choice, and some of the meat was quite tough. But that is a minor gripe. The Skyteam lounge at LHR was quiet and had good food -  the KLM Crown lounge at AMS was very busy with what I thought was a poor selection. At Kansai, the KIX lounge is used by KLM and was very good: nice food and drink options and plenty of staff to help out and clear. The flight was particularly good value for money. Recommended.

### "experience isn't comfortable"
I was in love with KLM but at some point I started feeling they're a fraud. Amsterdam to Istanbul and I got the same "pretzel sandwich" from Amsterdam and on the way back. The B737-700 are ugly planes by nature, so the experience isn't comfortable. How can a plane be so noisy on the inside? I couldn't hear my own headphones at the maximum volume at some point. The miles I was supposed to get with my specific fare (100%) weren't there and the community managers of KLM didn't care and kept repeating their "apologies". I had almost the same meal to go to Milano Linate than going to Istanbul Ataturk which is ridiculous since the length of the flight is almost double. The plane was acceptably clean, but didn't smell clean. The staff are always wonderful but I believe that considering the benefits of Turkish Airlines for the same route, I would never fly KLM again.

### "plenty of leg room"
Bristol to Amsterdam was great with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. On time and plenty of leg room. For the 8 hour flight to Nairobi I had paid extra for "economy comfort" which simply meant the extra legroom seats in economy class - no other benefit that I could discern. The plane was an ageing 747 and the seats were surprisingly narrow. I am not fat but I am 6'4" and I dread to think how cramped it would feel without the legroom. Thankfully there was nobody beside me. It honestly felt narrower than bog standard short haul low cost airlines I normally fly. Quite a shock for a premium carrier on a long haul aircraft. Having said that flights were on time, staff were great, catering and IFE were good. Communications were good and the transfer in Amsterdam seamless. If they could just sort out the narrow seats I would be happy to commit to them for long haul travel in the future.

### "I would fly them again"
This was my first time flying with KLM and I would fly with them again. Punctual, staff very polite and helpful, check-in facilities easy to use. There was plenty of leg room in the plane, smooth take off and landing. It was a nice little touch where they offered a light snack and coffee.

### "seat was pretty decent"
I would like to say that KLM is just a good airline for me, however, my flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta wasn't that good! Everything before boarding to the aircraft was perfect. I sat on 33A (window seat) and the window was extremely dirty and scratched. The IFE was very annoying, it isn't touchscreen and the remote did not respond quickly. It also has lack of album, songs, and movie. The seat was pretty decent, with 3-4-3 seat configuration. I did enjoy the meal and staff service.

### "KLM is a different world"
I fly often between London and Amsterdam for work and despite alluring fares from low cost carriers, flying KLM is a different world. If KLM had a better price strategy they would be as busy as the low cost airlines. That said the service and detail on board is of great standard - Dutch prints on coffee cups and little treat boxes are a great touch delivered by their marketing team. The cake and wrap served on each flight were the best airplane snack food I've had. I'm more then happy to rate this flight as 10/10, but fares can be high for this 50 minute flight, and as such tomorrow I'm unfortunately flying a competitor.

### "will fly KLM again"
Tokyo Narita to Amsterdam was my first time with KLM and I was impressed. Online check in was very straightforward, a user-friendly website. At the airport, the check in process went smoothly. I liked how the pilot kept us informed all through out the flight. More importantly, there were no unnecessary PA announcements. The Boeing 777 seating was on a 3-4-3 configuration, but did not look and feel cramped at all. Blue, KLM's colour, made the interior look good and relaxing. Friendly and attentive cabin crew. The food was good and so was the inflight entertainment. We arrived at Schipol Airport on time and well rested. I will fly with KLM again.

### "seats in economy are extremely narrow"
I flew KLM from London Heathrow - Hong Kong via Amsterdam on 24th Jan 2015. First flight was on an Embraer 190 operated by KLM Cityhopper. Flight was good and on time so no complaints there. Flight to HKG was on an old 747 combi and was terrible. Flight was on time and cabin staff were pretty good, but the seats in economy are extremely narrow and have pretty much non existent. Also, the IFE controlls are in the armrest (at least on window seat) and are pretty difficult to access. Overall I'd recommend KLM for inter-Europe hops but I'd say stay away from long haul unless you enjoy cramped seats.

### "flight attendants were nice and helpful"
This was the early bird flight out of Copenhagen to Amsterdam at 0600 and everything work very well with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Quick boarding, departure and arrival on time and the flight attendants were nice and helpful. Even though it was a full flight it was comfortable and seats in Economy are fine without being great in any way.

### "fly with KLM again"
We were 3 hours late departing Edinburgh so missed our connecting flight from Amsterdam to Toronto. We were forced to take a flight to JFK New York and then another flight from there to Toronto. Although it was very inconvenient and tiring, I realize that sometimes things happen that you cannot control. I contacted the customer service people when we returned and they were extremely helpful and compensated us for the flight. I would fly with KLM again!

### "complete ignorance from KLM "
We were rebooked on this flight from Amsterdam to Lima due to late incoming flight from Stockholm (not KLM fault), so we missed the direct flight to Quito. Our final destination was Quito. In Amsterdam uninterested staff in the transfer area. We could not get our Boarding passes from KLM for the flight from Lima to Quito with TAME, a carrier unknown to us. Our luggage was to be sent directly to Quito with the same flights. Onboard this KLM flight, the cabin was old but the service was OK. Inflight we were told that a person would meet us and help us with the transfer in Lima. Nobody turned up so we had to find the gate for TAME by ourself. That was not open so we went to KLM gate for the returning flight, they knew nothing and were not interested to help us. Eventually we received our Boarding passes at the gate, Economy class as this was the only provided, we were not informed of that. In Quito, were we arrived 7 hours later than our original shedule, our luggage was missing so we made a search with help of a serviceminded person of TAME. The day afterwards we e-mailed KLM and asked them to contact us, they did not. Next day I called them and was told that our luggage was not their business any more but it was up to TAME to find out were it was, they did not intend to follow-up on this. In our hotel we had wonderful staff that called the airport a lot of times and at last, 40 hours after arrival we got it delivered to the hotel (sent from Lima by LAN Chile). The baggage tags were left and we could see that KLM had not redirected the luggage, no wonder that they were not transported properly. KLM has put a new standard to their device "Sky Priority": For a little more money we make your trip much more exciting. We found this trip to be extremely tiring and the complete ignorance from KLM is exceptional.

### "a great experience"
Amsterdam to New York JFK with KLM and from boarding till disembarking it was a great experience. Great meals (I would not recommend the eggs though) and friendly staff. Nice pillow and blanket and a lot of choice in the entertainment system. The prices are higher than other airlines, but my experience was worth the money.

### "it is an excellent airline"
Vancouver to Brussels via Amsterdam. As a frequent flyer on Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge, I felt as if I were in wonderland on KLM. The staff are wonderful - friendly, smiling, helpful and  passing up and down the aisles offering water, drinks, snacks, assistance. The hot meals on this flight for dinner and breakfast, were tasty and plentiful. My no red meat husband ordered a Hindu meal for no extra charge and it too was outstanding. The wine was excellent, and I noticed the cabin stewards offered a variety of alcohol if one wanted to drink. Blankets and pillows were provided, as were comfortable headphones. The entertainment was great with lots of choice of new movies and varied shows. The premium economy seats we were in were extremely comfortable, with more than adequate leg room and a good recline that enabled an easy nap. I think it is an excellent airline, and far better than the many American carriers and Air Canada flights I have flown before.

### "going to miss Schiphol"
Dammam to Amsterdam. I will say that I like KLM, Schiphol Airport and love the Dutch people. My one big complaint is Delta Airlines - an awful airline. I fly out of Dammam, Saudi Arabia and KLM is very convenient for me. On my flights to the US, KLM has turned over the trans-Atlantic and Domestic flying to Delta. Delta's aircraft are old and uncomfortable, the service is sub-par and I have had 3 instances of missed connections with Delta - and one unbelievably bad experience in Atlanta. I became so frustrated with Delta that I left KLM. I am at home in Las Vegas at the moment having flown on Lufthansa - wonderful, wonderful experience. Lufthansa now has my business. My point in this message is that Delta Airlines must be doing damage to KLM reputation. I'm going to miss Schiphol Airport. The rating below is for KLM, not Delta

### "more and more like low cost"
Atlanta to Stockholm via Amsterdam with KLM, and the flights arrived about on time. Nice staff and fair price. Inflight entertainment is okay, but the product more and more like low cost carrier. Food worse than 2-3 years ago and w below an acceptable standard now. Check in at Arlanda under staffed which led to stress. Sad to see the decline as I'm sure the product could be better - even without an increase in fares.

### "one of my favourite airlines"
Mexico City to Amsterdam and excellent ground and onboard service on this KLM flight. Nice meals (typical dutch) and good inflight entertainment. Legspace could be better. Excellent online check-in with the possibility to buy better seats (economy comfort) or upgrade with at a good discount. Definitely one of my favourite airlines.

### "never going on this airline again"
Amsterdam to Dubai with KLM. The lounge in Amsterdam was awful the food selection and quality and seating were all very poor we could not eat anything except the biscuits. Onboard, the aircraft seating was generous but lacked lumbar support I could hardly stand up from the back pain I got! We had asked for Muslim meals, apparently KLM have just one Muslim meal to offer all passengers because it was exactly the same meal we got a month ago flying to the United States - apparently KLM are cutting a lot of corners trying to reduce costs. The final straw was arriving in Dubai my connection to Doha on FlyDubai was cancelled for my 11 month old son and if it wasn't for the kindness of DNATA officials who convinced FlyDubai to take my son on an infant booking rather than a child fare which I had paid KLM for! Also my sons stroller was lost - I sent emails to KLM for an explanation and got no response. Although I am a Gold Member of flying Blue I am never going on this airline again.

### "I felt well cared for"
My husband son and I flew to Calgary from Cardiff via Amsterdam, on Dec 19th returning Jan 4th 2016. Both trips in economy class. About a week before the start of the journey I found myself having to use crutches for a knee complaint. I was quite concerned about how I would cope with everything from seat space to just getting around the airport etc, but KLM staff/cabin crew were excellent and I felt well cared for. The seat space was enough for me to feel comfortable. I was disappointed that although only in row 17, the choice of food ran out by the time it reached me leaving only a veg spicy dish which I cannot eat. Luckily there were bread rolls etc. A minor complaint but worth mentioning. Our flight from Calgary was about an hour late getting in, meaning that we missed our connection and had about 7 hrs to wait in Schipol. I was helped with a wheel chair and we were given on request vouchers towards a meal. A big thank you to the assistance team who took us out to the plane and those who took us through passport control etc. Thank you KLM.

### "good crisis management"
I have been flying with KLM to Europe regularly over the past 3 years. I am very impressed by the efficiency, cabin service and attention to detail. On my most recent flight from Singapore to Oslo, via Amsterdam, it departed 2.5 hours late from Changi Airport. I knew I would miss my connecting flight to Oslo. Anxious to know whether I would be automatically rebooked, I paid EUR 20 to use the onboard wifi on the SIN-AMS flight. The connection was fast enough and I was relieved to receive an e-mail and text message from KLM that I would be re-booked on the afternoon flight to Oslo. Well done KLM for having a good team to do crisis management in situations like this. The economy comfort seat that I had was in the centre row just behind business class. No passenger was seated in front of me and I had generous leg space and could stretch out completely to sleep.

### "good and relaxed experience"
Flew KLM Royal Dutch Airlines from Amsterdam to Vancouver. Generally good and relaxed experience with friendly cabin crew. The only downsides were: Older Airbus A330 including the in-flight entertainment system (mediocre movie selection) with a confusing remote control that is placed in the armrest and would pause/stop a movie if you accidentally bumped into it. The entertainment system requires a big metal box under every 2 seats that took up a 1/3 of available foot space making it impossible to stretch both which was rather uncomfortable on the 9+ hour flight. The seat was hard but the space and distance between other seats was good. Food was edible and nicely presented with Dutch images on the packaging.

### "only choose for the price "
KLM from Heathrow to Amsterdam on Boeing 737-800, with just two rows of business class which is honestly economy class, except the middle seats have a tray to give a division. Flight was packed so no room for cabin luggage and had to place underneath the seat. Snack was a fluffy slice of packed cake which I declined as it looked very average. I was served a chilled Heineken can and carton of water. Flight was done by the time I had finished my drink and cleverly they announced they were ahead of schedule - when in fact all they had just over extended the flight time on the ticket information. I would only choose this flight for the price and fact it flies from Heathrow.

### "cramped economy seats"
Cape Town to Berlin via Amsterdam. My first experience in the new KLM Boeing 777-200 economy class layout. Where in the past there were nine people sitting in the row, there were now ten. While sitting straight my shoulders touched the shoulders of my neighbour. That is not comfortable. To find some sleep in this narrow situation is difficult. The legroom in the extra legroom economy is fine and the recline of the seat helps. In my opinion this is worth the money. The new entertainment system in the 777-200 was fine and they had a nice collection of films and shows. The flight attendants were friendly and nice. Boarding in Cape Town as complicated and inefficient. There is so much space in the hall but they have to do it right in the smallest corner. The passengers are getting pushed around like cattle and nobody knows what is going on. The flight from Amsterdam to Berlin was fine - not special, just a flight between two cities. However, the cramped economy seats on the Boeing 777-200 makes it difficult to recommend KLM.

### "a bit more legroom"
Amsterdam to Shanghai with KLM. Nothing to complain about. Food acceptable, wines very nice. Flight left on time and arrived on the dot. Cabin crew nice and being a Platinum Flying Blue member I was greeted by name - first time I experienced this! Economy comfort seats do give you a bit more legroom and is nice on a long flight.

### "seat slightly uncomfortable"
Jakarta to Manchester, via Kuala Lumpur and Amsterdam. Boarded on time, cabin crew welcomed us nicely. Tasty food from Jakarta to KUL. We got Christmas gifts from the airline during transit. Flew again and only slept until 3am because seat was slightly uncomfortable. Had breakfast a few hours later. When we landed, the captain said that a flight attendant had completed her last flight after serving with the airline for 38 years! We congratulated her and then deplaned. Waited for 3 hours for the flight to MAN and good legroom on that flight as we sat at the emergency exit.

### "seats quite comfortable"
Flew KLM  on Christmas day from Atlanta to Accra via Amsterdam on Boeing 777-200s. Flight one hour late leaving ATL due to late arrival of inbound and baggage issues. Supper served leaving ATL (drinks, main tray with two choices, salad, dessert and hot breakfast prior to arrival). Crew efficient, pleasant and hard working as departure from ATL. Slightly better and longer meal service on 6 hour flight AMS-ACC flight. Crew  helpful and attentive. Business class seats quite comfortable and I think better than Skyteam partner Delta. Returning 777-200 leaving Accra at 10.00pm had same supper choices and hot breakfast for 6hr 30 min flight to AMS. Again the crew was delightful and very friendly. AMS to ATL on A330-200 which I did not like - IFE did not work well, seats not nearly as comfortable as 777. Crew first rate but same menu as AMS-ACC in business. Overall I was quite surprised and happy.

### "three out of four flights delayed"
VIE-AMS and three other short flights in Economy on Boeing 737-800, with three out of four flights delayed. Although I left ample transfer time of 90 minutes to catch my connection flights in AMS, the inbound delays resulted in mad run through the terminal to catch my connection both times, as Schipol has very long distances between gates. On the way out I had just carry-on luggage and made my connection at the last minute. On the way back I managed to reach my connection, but my check luggage did not, which was not really surprising. It was delivered the next day. Used Web check-in which working fine and KLM allows to pre-select seats during the reservation process at no extra cost. Checked luggage is charged extra, but prices are reasonable (EUR 10 per flight). FA´s friendly and attentive. Seats were comfortable for the length of the flights. Drinks served including beer and wine, with additional drinks on request. A cheese sandwich with no alternatives served on the inbound flights to AMS and biscuits/crisps on outbound legs. Forget the food, but the drink service was okay. Not a bad inflight product for European standards. However, room for improvement operational wise (delays and lost luggage). I had pretty much stopped flying KLM 10 years ago when service quality decreased and their previously good frequent flyer program became rubbish. While Flying Blue is still bad, KLM inflight service has improved. Recommended if delays do not become standard.

### "cabin staff was friendly"
Amsterdam to Bangkok with KLM. The outbound flight to Bangkok was great. The check-in process at Schiphol is easy. The economy cabin fits 10 seats abreast, which makes the aisles narrow. The seats are alright to sit and snooze, after about 7 hours we couldn't really find a good position to sit comfortably, but that happens when flying long haul economy I guess. Inflight entertainment is very extensive and offers a wide variety of films, series and games. The cabin staff was friendly. The return flight we had a better experience because we booked a pair of seats in the rear of the plane, so we could sit next to each other as a couple. Again friendly staff. Good value for a reliable journey.

### "fine except for the snack"
The boarding was as slow as usual. Everything else was fine except for the snack. This consisted of a tasty wrap - raw falafel in a half raw pancake. It tasted horrible. Upon examining the list of ingredients I discovered it contained, anong other things, milk, no good for the lactose intolerant. The spring water came from Turkey! I had originally planned to travel on 24th December but had to change my booking after discovering that no trains run from Oslo Gardamoen after 17:03 that day. Christmas eve Norway comes to a standstill.

### "meals and service good"
I flew from Calí to Amsterdam in Comfort seats at the front of the Economy Class, KLM charged 100€ in addition to the Y-fare which I consider good value for money. The seat is reclinable, with enough legroom and relatively good for sleeping. Meals and service were good and the friendly steward was generously offering wines and a brandy after the meal. So all in all I was highly satisfied with this KLM flight.

### "seats very uncomfortable"
Bangkok to Barcelona via Amsterdam. The flight Amsterdam to Bangkok was delayed 2 hours due to a technical problem but we proceeded to Bangkok because it was not dangerous and we arrived to Bangkok just 1 hour later. From Bangkok to Amsterdam an arrogant staff forced me to move 2 kilos of overweight from my baggage to my hand luggage in front of the rest of passengers at the checking-in desk. No problems with the same baggage/weight flying the low-cost airline Thai Smile (Thai Airways), in a domestic flight, and the ticket costs around 1500 baht (38 euros). My KLM ticket was almost 900 euros but it seems that KLM became a Ryanair partner. It seems that some KLM passengers flying to Bangkok are not an example of politeness and discipline. Impossible to sleep or relax, some passengers are noisy and unable to sit down for a while, and most cabin lights are switched on all time. Nobody is able to sleep. Seats are very uncomfortable, especially for long distance flights, and there is no legroom. Food is OK.

### "friendly and cheerful"
Athens to Amsterdam return with KLM. Flight boarded on time, however we had to wait seated inside the aircraft more than 45mins due to airport traffic in Athens airport. Return flight was also delayed about 30 mins. Clean aircraft, bright and relaxed atmosphere. Crew very friendly and cheerful. Flight about 85% and almost 100% respectively. Nice variety and plenty of drinks, however food was minimal with no option to purchase, which left me hungry. Check in luggage is charged, so lot of people carrying a lot of hand luggage, making some passengers nervous, even annoyed. In the return flight however they did ask for quite a few passengers to check in their hand luggage free of charge, which made it a bit easier. I would say their level of service is in between low cost and full service - for short/medium hall.

### "happy I am now in Hong Kong"
I have just flown my outward leg of a short break to Hong Kong and have mixed feelings about the journey. I should have left Manchester at 7.50am but the flight was apparently oversold so got bumped to a later flight which was actually listed as the 5.50am earlier flight that was delayed due to a technical problem. Given how empty this later actually flight was, I think it was more the case of me being bumped because I had no status with the airline and KLM simply moved all their Gold and Silver members to my flight. I was supposed to be connecting to a Xiamen Airlines flight (AMS-XMN then XMN-HKG) in AMS but after pointing out that I might make the connection but my baggage definitely wouldn't, the check-in staff agreed and rerouted me. The only way I could get to Hong Kong was to be rebooked onto KLM's direct flight leaving AMS at 5.45pm so had nearly 6 hours layover in Schipol airport. However I was offered 120 euros as compensation so wasn't too depressed and it meant not having to go through the nonsense of immigration at Xiamen despite being a transit passenger. The first leg of the journey (MAN-AMS) left after 9.30am and was not helped by whoever's decision it was to refuel it the plane only once all the passengers were on-board the aircraft. I ask you, this aircraft had been sat empty for at least previous 3 hours! The flight itself was comfortable with decent seat width/pitch plus crew came around with a snack and a drink. Once at AMS, I found the KLM desk and managed to bag an exit row for the 11 hour flight and was delighted until I discovered that the plane (B747-400) had no in-seat USB power in economy unlike the new Xiamen Airlines B787 Dreamliner (which is partly why I booked with Xiamen Airlines in the first place). Boarding was smooth but I was surprised how tight in width the seats were. However once into the flight, I could really understand why many airlines are now ditching the 747 in favour of more modern planes like the the 787 or the A380. However this KLM flight did have one redeeming feature that was the staff who worked hard the entire flight. The toilets which I was sat close to were cleaned around 4-5 times and crew offered drinks throughout the flight. The food offerings were beef or pasta but by the time they reached me, the pasta had run out and I thought I might be missing out but was brought along a vegetarian Indian style meal which was rather good. As we were descending into Hong Kong, I discovered my seat was broken and could not return to the upright position. One of the crew came around and fixed it but a few minutes later, I could feel it had gone again when I leant back. Given we were so close to landing, I just leant forward instead and kept quiet. The best thing about the whole flight is that I only paid £340 including credit card charge booking fees so happy that I am now in Hong Kong and enjoying my break.

### "I'm done with KLM"
Amsterdam to Hong Kong. This is probably the last time I take KLM, especially for long distance; I only did because I have flying blue and wanted the miles (not that being a FB customer for 10 years has brought me any tangible benefits). KLM is basically a low-cost, Ryanair style carried which pretends to be a proper airline. On this 10-12 hour flight, the seat in front of me was broken, so the guy was basically in my knees, as there is no legroom to start with on these horrid, narrow seats, where you will also jostle for the armrest. Food was simply awful, though less bad coming back from Hong Kong; I know the Netherlands are not a culinary hotspot but they could have made an effort, this was canteen food, everything shrink-wrapped in cellophane and unappetising to say the least. There was also way too little food on the way back, and no advertising of the measly sandwiches available in the galleys (only one choice though, slightly musty Dutch cheese and butter, healthy!). The stewardess seemed reluctant to give them away, does she take them home at the end of service? Entertainment system is ancient, not even touchscreen, with small, pixellated screen and a pathetically poor selection of movies and other stuff; really bad! Loyalty card or not, I'm done with KLM as they have no conception of passenger comfort and wellbeing.

### "attendants were professional"
Dubai to Los Angeles via Amsterdam with KLM. Both legs offered flat bed business class seats but the IFE on the Boeing 777 was a much more modern version compared with the one on the Boeing 747-400. Flight attendants were professional and did not bother you unless there was a necessity, a friendly service and we had requested Moslem Meals which were catered and very tasty and generous portions. KLM offer a very old and poor selection on their TV segment on the IFE, also the game selection is very poor especially on the 747-400s, the movie selection is a little better but seriously KLM needs to improve in this field. I really like KLM and I try to fly them whenever I can - the whole package is not perfect but it is nice and friendly .

### "Service was efficient"
Flew KLM from AMS to ICN. Airport check-in was fast with skyteam priority lane. The airplane was old but fully renovated. Seats are more comfortable with lie-flat seats. Basically 2-2 configuration in the front section of B747 with the last row on the lower deck was 2-2-2. Didn't go up to the upper deck, but it should be 2-2. Not a compartment type of business seats on newer generation of airplanes of many different airlines, but plenty of leg room and space. Seats were a little bit on hard side, but adequate. Service was efficient, Dutch style. Foods were OK, basic Western style food. Wine selection was good enough to try various kinds of wines including ports wine as a desert wine. Entertainment was basic, there is a room for improvement with more channels and movies. Departure and arrival time was puncture; actually, arrived earlier. Very comfortable ride to ICN from AMS. Much improved cabin comfort compared to the cabin of the same airplanes of KLM few years back.

### "seat pitch acceptable"
Barcelona to Amsterdam. Good and simple working internet check in by email alert. Baggage drop off convenient and friendly staff. verbal information on the gate because of "Barcelona’s" decision to hold passengers in the shopping mall by announcing the gate only shortly before boarding. Flight full, but seat pitch acceptable. Onboard staff friendly and give a feeling of competence. Slightly delayed arrival, maybe because of heavy winds in AMS which cause a bumpy final approach.

### "cancelled without notification"
Lagos to New York via Amsterdam. The connecting flight DL 0049 from Amsterdam to New York was cancelled without notification or bill or screen board alerts. At the lounge, it look forever for the scantly populated work desk to attend to frustrated customers. KLM can do better and this was unlike the usual service. Suggest the early morning issues are dealt with smoothly with more staff attending to customers. Have spent over 1hour without being attended to yet. Still waiting to get to my turn.

### "not recommend flying them"
Worst long flight. As you enter the plane you can smell that it's very old, a good to start a very long flight. Entertainment system is very old and screens need replacement, they don't have usb plug to recharge your phone or tablet. Food is terrible, me nor my partner could eat the main course (single option was provided).. They left us with trash on our trays for 3 hours making it very difficult to move, and did not clean the toilets during the flight. They say they will have renovated plane interiors by 2016, I would not recommend flying with them before that.

### "bags from London not on flight"
Arrived in Manila 4 hours ago. The flight from LHR at 1705 was cancelled and rebooked for 1750 but was late taking off which meant the connection at Schipol was a frantic run through the airport and customs - and I mean a run, through the customs and on the plane. At Taipei all 400 passengers had to get of the plane, queue through customs had a ramble round the airport with our hand carrys then queue through customs and straight back on the plane - you can imagine the queues. In Manila we queued for our luggage and after all the bags were collected was informed all those from London were not on the flight - so an hour wasted, another hour for the paperwork to be sorted. After travelling for 30 hours was not impressed, surely they could have informed us during the flight of the position with the baggage. Inflight service was usual KLM standard, but the comments KLM are getting seems to suggest many are getting the run around on flight times.

### "Very comfortable flight"
Flown in a Boeing 787 for the first time and probably the most comfortable aircraft I have flown so far. It has WIFI but it's a little expensive compared to Emirates for instance. Then the seat design makes feel almost double the reclining and space in between seat can be felt. Flight attendants were professional and courteous. Interactive system was awesome and has a single pin if one wants to plug in own headset. I was so tired that I slept and skipped my meal therefore I am unable to give an opinion about it. But before landing I have enjoyed a hot snack and refreshments which was not bad at all. Very comfortable flight.

### "getting rebooked was a disaster"
KLM from Manchester to Bogota via Amsterdam and London. Check-in online and baggage drop smooth at Manchester. Flight initially delayed because of fog but then held up due to a technical problem so missed the connecting flight in Amsterdam. Getting rebooked was a disaster with surly staff who either ignored or didn't know EU law regarding service in such cases and took an eternity to issue new boarding passes - no choice of seats offered and all requests refused. Routed via London after a 7 hour stay in Amsterdam, so 9 hours late and then another wait in London of 4 hours. Better experience on return from Bogota to Amsterdam on a new plane routing with an hour wait in Cali. Plane of 180 seats had about 40 passengers so attentive service, good IFE system 10 in screens lots of entertainment choices

### "made a lot of improvements"
An excellent KLM flight from Amsterdam to Cape Town. The flight was on-time. The new World business class seat have more space than the old one, and is full flat in rest position. The catering was delicious, good food and a nice wine selection. Also the flight entertainment is on a good level as well. KLM has made a lot of improvements.

### "seats too close to each other"
New York to Singapore via Amsterdam with KLM.The flight from Singapore to Amsterdam on 6th November 2015 was delayed for about 2 hours due to the incoming flight from Bali having been delayed by volcanic activity in Bali. The cockpit crew did a good job and managed to make up for some time and arrived in Amsterdam slightly earlier which gave me an hour to transfer to a JFK bound Delta flight instead of 30mins. The cabin crew was pleasant and efficient. There was some light snacks available in the galley although the food portions for the 2 meal service seem a little light. I did see quite a few hungry passengers approaching the cabin crew for food about 8-10 hours into the flight. The meals were satisfying and had a decent variety of items. I took the exit row seat (50K) against the wall (no windows). The seats seem cramped. Whenever the gentlemen next to me unfold his arms, his arms would come into my seat area and rest over my arms. This is not a case of his arms resting on the shared arm rest but a case of the arms coming past the armrest into my seat area. I put it down to the seats being placed too close next to each other which made for a very uncomfortable 13-14 hours flight. I'm 5'6" and not overweight so I don't think I was too large for my seat. The gentlemen was tall, large but not obese in anyway. Thankfully, the gentlemen made a point to fold his arms so that I didn't have to push my shoulders against the wall in order to give him space.

### "airline is so unreliable"
London City to Beijing via Amsterdam. The airline is so unreliable and I have not had one flight on time. The Beijing to Amsterdam has been delayed for 2 hours, due to the mechanical issues with the aircraft which has made me missing an importance family occasion. It is very tricky that the airline has set the delay as 1 hour 40 mins although the actual delay is more than 2 hours, could only guess they would like to avoid paying the foods and beverages. Then the Amsterdam to Beijing is late for another hour due to "late arrival aircraft" which does not tell you why it was delayed in the first places, which has made the connection extremely tight. Running through the airport without people to help. Finally get onboard flight to LCY, luggage not arrived and KLM is refusing on paying reimbursement for the personal goods The crews are doing a good job, entertainment system in general good and foods ok. However, KLM has missed the most fundamental operational requirements for on time arrivals.

### "last experience with KLM"
Amsterdam to Beijing, and my booked seat was changed without prior notice. Special ordered meals were of bad quality. When comparing this experience with KLM, there are much better choices available. On my continuing flight from Beijing to Nanning with China Southern, all the things missed during the long haul KLM flight were okay (seat and booked vegetarian meal). Conclusion : first and last experience with KLM.

### "not recommend on longer flights"
Living in the Netherlands, KLM is my airline of choice. I am also a member of the their flying blue program, trying to get my status to a point that makes sense. This review applies to all my flights with KLM this year. The last flight was not to bad. KLM planes are generally old and uncomfortable but on short flights that is not a problem. On longer flights (I flew to South Africa 4 times this year), I would not recommend them. The staff in almost all cases is friendly and will do all they can to make the flight bearable. But don't try to complain to KLM customer service, they are the worst in the industry and will ignore your request or simply insult you in their answer. I think KLM quality is going down over the years. They do their best to cope but I cannot help but fear that KLM will not survive in the long run as customer satisfaction is what makes us choose an airline over anything else. If any other airline would make Amsterdam an international hub, I would certainly reconsider them.

### "seat quite comfortable"
Flight was especially comfortable in one of the newer A330-300 planes of KLM. Flight was on-time, great staff and new safety video. Seat quite comfortable, better than the old Boeing 777-200 or A330-200 seats. Additionally the lighting in the cabin gave a nice atmosphere. KLM flights are good, but nothing really special.

### "prices quite high for what you get"
Flew with KLM to Lima on via Panama and direct flight back. Flight to Panama was operated by Boeing 777-200. Quite an old one, with screens 10×15cm or so. Seat space quite narrow. The crew was quite helpful. Good experience was to fly on the second leg with Copa airlines:  just 3.5 hours flight, but big touchscreens, very polite crew and comfortable seats. Flight from Lima operated by quite new Boeing 777-300. Bigger screen and better choice of entertainment, but the seats were very uncomfortable even for a person like me just 1.7m height. Almost no reclining. Vegetarian meal ordered - terrible. KLM is reliable, but the price they ask for their services is quite high for what you get. I'll definitely avoid them for flying to Asia as they are obviously still far away from service level of Middle -East carriers and when flying over the Atlantic will try some other options.

### "had to pay for carryon"
We are seniors and this is the second time using KLM. This year using a stop at Paris then to Rome to connect with a cruise we did our own booking on the KLM website. The flight from Toronto to Paris our luggage weight was okay on an Air France (sister airline) flight, also on our return two flights from Rome to Amsterdam and onto Toronto it was okay. When we checked in for our flight Paris to Rome it was at an Air France counter but the boarding pass said our flight was with Alitalia and to check in at their gate  where a the gate they had a makeshift scale and weighed everything including my wife's purse, and said I would have to check in my carryon as along with a small bag it was overweight and to pay 70 Euros ($115 Canadian). We had no choice but to pay they said that they did not have the same rules as KLM which we were not told about. We called customer service to complain when we got home and they said they could not help even though we had booked on their site, and we would have to call Alitalia. When we called we were told that we would have to e-mail them as they do not accept phone calls which we did also to KLM but have not had any replies.

### "no other flight was cancelled"
Barcelona to Edmonton via Amsterdam. Our KLM flight was cancelled due to fog in Amsterdam. No other flight that day was cancelled. We were put up in an airport hotel far from Barcelona. The hotel walls were so thin I could hear the person in the next room coughing all night. The next day KLM rebooked us on a inferior airline and when I wrote KLM about it they said they wanted to get me home to my loved ones. My loved ones were with me. We chose KLM for their reputation and it was a direct flight home. We nearly missed our connection in Toronto with the redirected flight home. We never would have booked the airlines we were put on.

### "impressed at KLM's customer care"
I fly frequently between London and Amsterdam. I used to fly British Airways but they then introduced fixed seating on a hand luggage only fare (meaning unless you paid more, you didn't get a choice of seat). KLM seem to be competitive to the BA price but allow you to choose seats and only charge more for premium seats. I have to say I am impressed at KLM's customer care. So far they have changed flights for me without me having to take out a mortgage to pay for it, on my most recent flight I accidently left my tablet in the seat pocket, no problem - a very helpful KLM representative went back to the aircraft, retrieved it for me and brought it back to me in the baggage hall.

### "Customer Care is a disaster"
A very sour KLM ground stewardess checked us in at Schiphol in Amsterdam, The boarding was a giant mess. Business Class passengers were even asked to hold up their hands in order to find them in the chaos. Quite embarrassing! A mistake has been made with our frequent flyer miles. According to the boarding passes issued on the day of the flight, our miles would be booked on our Delta accounts. Mine ended up on KLM's Flying Blue and those of my husband ended up nowhere. At first KLM tried to ignore the issue, thereafter it saw it as our problem, finally it realized that we had sufficient proof to show that KLM itself had made the mistake. It took KLM over 2 months to get the frequent flyer miles on my Delta account. My husband is still waiting. I have spent tons of time dealing with this - in itself minor - issue. KLM's Customer Care is a disaster. All apologies, but no action. I hate KLM's 'no names given' policy. I'm Dutch and in the Dutch language we have a 'formal you' and an 'informal you'. I find it highly inappropriate that an anonymous KLM associate of Customer Care approached me with the 'informal you'. It is simply not done!

### "service was great"
My first flight wih KLM on the route FRA-AMS-FRA. Service was great. Although we had some turbulence, flight attendants did provide snacks and drinks. They were kind and attentive. Due to small configuration of aircraft, our hand luggages were taken on the apron and loaded into the belly. On my flights with other airlines, I'm always told to store it under the seat which considerably restricts leg space. We departed and landed on time. So overall great experience. This certainly was not my last flight with KLM.

### "seats now 10 abreast"
Amsterdam to Fukuoka with KLM. New Boeing 777-200 cabin interior with stylish but narrow seats, now 10 abreast. AVOD got an update with somewhat bigger screens and okay but still not very big selection. Chat function was nice. Crew very nice, cheerful. The onboard catering was good and dutch style nice touch. Customer service was disappointing - not willing to make me skip an onward domestic connection due to typhoon coming to that area in the next coming days, with consequence that my return flight home would be cancelled if I actually would choose not to board this flight. Also the actual return flight got cancelled due to operational circumstances, communication was just over 2 weeks before return, got rebooked but new connection took almost six hours longer and was not non-stop. Unfortunately no form of compensation offered.

### "happier walking instead of KLM"
We, a family of 4, traveled with KLM from Düsseldorf to Bordeaux via Amsterdam. All of the passengers that connected from Düsseldorf found KLM/Air France had not put the Düsseldorf luggage on the Bordeaux bound plane. The baggage claim customer service said knowingly, "that happens all the time. It took 8 hours for the luggage to be delivered to the airport in Bordeaux. It then took KLM 5 days to deliver the luggage to the place we were staying, two hours away. I called begging for my luggage every day and even offered to come to the airport, but they would not allow it. Our vacation was a long one lasting a full 3 weeks. I got back to Germany and sent paperwork to KLM for 200€ of reimbursement for the clothes and toiletries we needed to buy in the 5 days that the luggage was not delivered. KLM, responded saying that they did not receive the claim within 21 days of the luggage being lost, so they simply did not care and would not do anything for the horrible experience they put my family through. Given the choice pay the extra 10 euro and fly with a better airline! Otherwise take the train. You may be happier walking instead of KLM!

### "happy with the service"
Amsterdam to Geneva. I'm loyal to KLM and overall was happy with the service. It's only a short flight, but seat 6F uncomfortable and in need of replacement. The inflight service provided  a drink and a snack, which is enough for a 55 minutes flight.

### "first baby trip a great pleasure"
Lisbon to Calgary via Amsterdam. We just recently got back from our trip to Portugal and a great experience on all fronts. We were traveling with our 6 month old daughter and KLM made every effort to make our lives easier (consequently making life more pleasant for every else on board)! The gate staff found us in the lounge and provided us with priority boarding, allowing us to get settled without slowing down other passengers. We had booked a bassinett for the flight which was promptly brought after take off. The cabin crew was flexible with our meals if we were in the midst of dealing with the kiddo and offered to bring food later. The airline also offers a 10kg checked bag, two pieces of baby equipment and a carry on at no charge, even when you do not have a seat booked for them, in this day and age of restrictions this was huge for us. In general the crew was incredibly understanding and unfazed by our little one, often engaging with her and trying to make her laugh if she was getting fussy. It was a huge help and stress reliever to know we weren't treated as an annoyance to be tolerated. As far as general comments the seats were standard but definitely more comfortable than some flights we've been on. The food quality was average but kudos to the variety and inventiveness; we had items such as a Mozzarella Tomato salad with pesto, tiramisu dessert and pretzel breakfast Buns. Thank you KLM for helping make our first baby travelling trip a great pleasure!

### "pretty average experience"
Flew KLM from San Francisco to Rome with a layover in Amsterdam. I had very high expectations for this airline, but found our experience to be pretty average. We made it there safely and on time which is what really matters. Meals were edible and the occasional snack was provided during the long haul (caramel waffle, cookies). A chicken sandwich was served on the Amsterdam to Rome flight. No vegetarian options available on our shorter route. Beer and wine served on both flights. Flight attendants were pretty difficult to come by and rarely responded to requests for service. Inflight entertainment was great, although became a bit redundant during our long flight back to the states (same films shown). Decent airline. I would fly KLM again and recommend to others.

### "worst flight I have had"
Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam with KLM, and a third of the footwell is taken up with the entertainment box that does not work. By the time they got to my seat for the light snack and breakfast there was no choice - I mentioned I had not been given a choice the cabin staff said she would go check in the back. Ten minutes later still no food, so I approach the cabin staff only to be told she thought I was rude! I then explain I have as much right to seat with full access a entertainment system that works and a meal choice at least one out of two. She changed her approach when I asked for a complaint form. Chief purser appears to ask if everything is ok? I have to go online to complain. Been flying with Klm for 18 years but the worst flight I have had.

### "real Dutch hospitality"
Rebooked to KLM from overbooked Ukraine International light. Check in in Kiev in the last minute and had to press the handling agent to do their work (on screen counter was shown as opened for checkin, unfortunately, agent decided that he didnt wanted to work and caused long row for checkin at just one other counter for approx.180 PAX). Flights with KLM surprisingly smooth. Seat space even well for 1,90m and more. Plane new and clean. Snacks, Sandwiches and little sweets and drinks for free - real Dutch hospitality. However, self-transfer in AMS didnt worked, but staff at transfer-desk was very helpful and attentive! 55 mins transfer-time in Schiphol are very tight, if you dont have the 2nd ticket already and to pass the passport-control. However, all worked well and in time. Pleasantly surprised! Just avoid seats 33D in the Boeing 737NG, because its opposite to toilet and it will be a bit uncomfortable!

### "clerk completely unhelpful"
I left my Ipad in the seat back and remembered immediately as I left security. Went to KLM check in clerk who was completely unhelpful. She asked for my flight info and instructed me to stand to the side. She made a phone call and told me to wait. No other info was provided. After an hour Of standing in view of her I asked for an update. She picked up the phone, made a call and said "I'm sorry sir. Your ipad is lost. There's nothing I can do". No other info was provided. It took 4 days of trying to contact KLM to figure out I should have logged a missing item report with Schiphol lost and found. When complaining to KLM about their failure to inform me of this they just quoted their policy and indicated they did everything the policy requires. I am a platinum level customer. That just changed. So long KLM! Learn to how to go above and beyond minimum requirements of your policy and you will keep customers.

### "rude and miserable"
While we paid for Premium Economy (upgraded at airport counter), when we got to the gate we looked at our boarding pass and discovered our boarding passes showed the same seats as our original ones in Economy, even though we had paid for an upgrade. When we noticed this, I asked the woman at the check in counter for help. She refused to even look and see if anyone had been placed in our upgraded seats and insisted we had to go back to the check in counter, which was impossible at this point, to get an upgrade. We tried to clarify we had already upgraded, but the agent had not issued the correct seats. She was adamant and stubborn, to the point of extreme rudness. Her two co-workers just stood there and stared at her, but they couldn't help because obviously she had the seniority. I asked her for her name and she repeatedy refused until I raised my voice and insisted. She told me I didn't need her name. As I boarded the plane, I leaned over and got her attention and announced that I had, in my many, many years of flying never run into a counter representative as rude and miserable as she was.

### "efficient service"
Bahrain to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi on KLM A330 in economy. Efficient service and crew excellent. Long overdue new Boeing 787 can't come soon enough though, the cabin's now starting to look dated and IFE screens need updating as soon as possible. Good breakfast before arrival into Schipol. Have a soft spot for KLM and the fact they fly to more points in the UK than any of our own makes them the perfect choice flying in from the Middle East.

### "Aeroflot several notches above KLM"
I agree entirely with the reviewer who was disgruntled with KLM business class between Moscow and Amsterdam. The outward business class flight (Amsterdam-Moscow) had been with Aeroflot, and I was initially disappointed to learn that it wasn't going to be KLM. I shouldn't have been! The Aeroflot experience was really good - we were greeted on arrival with a choice of sparkling white wine, orange juice or water, we were given a proper menu for lunch, and were served with a linen tablecloth and napkin. We were also offered small screen devices and headphones for watching films, but I didn't take one. There were only two seats per row, which meant they were really wide (though there's nothing separating you from your neighbour). The return, with KLM, was very disappointing. As the other reviewer mentioned, the seats were the standard narrow ones and they'd simply left the middle seat empty. That didn't bother me too much because it was only a medium haul flight, but the level of service and the quality of food was far inferior to Aeroflot. There was a choice of two main hot dishes, but no printed menu, and they had even run out of choice for the gentleman sitting behind me. He complained - justifiably - and whilst the steward serving the meals didn't seem to grasp the significance of a business class passenger not having his choice, the senior attendant did, and she was very apologetic and gave the passenger a gift of two small bottles of champagne to take with him on landing. But the hot meal was served in what was so obviously a microwaveable-type dish, with the foil cover left on it. We had been given a choice of orange juice or water on boarding - but no sparkling wine - and not until all the passengers had boarded (to be fair, the size of the plane would've made it difficult to serve us drinks as the aisles were filled with a stream of boarding passengers, but the absence of sparkling wine was disappointing - and they didn't have the finesse to give us napkins). There was no facility to watch a film. Basically, it was a standard flight that they'd just tried to 'tart up' a bit. With the Aeroflot flight, in contrast, you felt like it was a proper business class flight - we had even got toiletry bags, blankets, and a gift of speciality tea to take with us on landing. If I have to go to Moscow again, and am lucky enough to have business class flights paid for, I shall avoid KLM like the plague and make sure I get Aeroflot, who several notches above KLM.

### "business class was coach seats"
Moscow to Amsterdam. Save your money for business class with KLM! The worst of any airline I have flown. The Boeing 737-800 business class was coach class seats and the only way you knew it was business class is because the middle seat is empty. I am shocked they can even call this business class. But the good thing is they charge you as if it is world class business. Never fly KLM again.

### "would use again"
KLM is not too bad. Not the best airline I have been on, but not the worst. Legroom was acceptable for a short haul (or even a medium). Food was okay outbound, but poor on return leg. Cabin could have been a bit cleaner. I think this is more to do with aircraft age than cleanliness. Would use again for short/medium haul.

### "leg room was great"
Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam with KLM. Boarding at KUL was good. The new cabin interior is very modern. We flew economy comfort, and the added leg room for a long haul flight was great. The IFE allows recharging of devices via usb. Movie selection was ok, and IFE was easy to use. I like the earphones that are supplied, they fit over the ears and are suprisingly comfortable with good audio. Space around the seat is quite tight, (even in economy comfort) and when the person in front puts their seat back, their head is almost in your lap, can be difficult to eat your meal, while brushing away the person's hair in front of you. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. Our main problem was with a very short connection in Amsterdam, and there was not enough time to transfer into the schengen area. However after we got through passport control and with 5 minutes until our plane left, the gate was closed, so we headed straight to a transfer desk. The attendant check our tickets and immediately printed new passes for the next flight, as it was already organised that we had missed our flight, so this made things a lot easier. I am writing this as I wait for our next KLM flight to Vienna, so hopefully our bags will arrive on the same flight as the transfer desk had assured as they would. So overall, effective and efficient flight, just wish the food was a bit better.

### "shameless rip-off"
Flew to Venice notionally with Alitalia. By some trick of code sharing, the flight out was Air France and the return flight was KLM. One piece of checked in baggage free on the outward flight. On the return flight, there was no checked-in baggage allowance and I was forced to pay in order to get my baggage home. No advance warning about this either from Expedia or KLM. How can this shameless rip-off be allowed to happen. No more KLM filghts for me!

### "food was delicious"
Prague to Toronto via Amsterdam with KLM. The food was delicious, but my complaint is getting water bottle open is virtually impossible for a woman, and the flimsy mineral water containers that don't have a screw top are so full you get soaked just opening one. The ice cream was also hard to get into but worth the effort. As boomers age and travel more, we appreciate being able to comfortably access the food. Service and entertainment was excellent but seats are crowded.

### "price was very competitive"
Amsterdam to Rio de Janeiro with KLM. Very calm and relaxed flight. Friendly staff, good food. The only drawback was the control of the entertainment set was not working but the touch screen did work. I was still offered another seat but I was happy where I was using the touch screen. This was the last stretch of a long travel with 7 stops over 4 weeks and it felt good to relax before getting home. Not unimportantly, despite the many stopovers the price of the ticket was very competitive.

### "the staff so personable"
This was my first experience travelling with KLM and it was one of the best flights for me. The service, even in economy, was excellent and the staff so personable. There was no shortage of staff with so many to attend to and we were treated like royalty. The food was exceptional and there were little extras that I have never seen on any other airline. Our attendant was so calm and pleasant and made you feel like his whole heart went into his work. and I will certainly consider KLM when next I visit Europe.

### "had to find and pay our own way"
This is in conjunction with the KLM review from D Houghton (Canada) on 2nd October. I was on that flight and in that line too. It was ridiculous and uncalled for. It was nearly 6 hours in line before we were scheduled from Milan on United Airlines. I asked hours earlier if they could schedule us on another airline and was told no it must be a KLM flight. We were told we had seats on the Milan flight and when we got there we were on standby. The woman who helped us at United in Milan was kind and got us seats. In the 14 hours we were at Florence airport we were given one voucher for a sandwich. After we got our booking for Milan we had to find and pay our own way and find a hotel. Florence airport only allows one hour of free wifi which we had used early that morning so we had to pay for that too. It was 11:30pm by the time we got to our hotel in Milan and cost about 500 Euros. I wonder if KLM really will reimburse us.

### "Embraer 190 is comfortable"
KLM Cityhopper from Birmingham to Amsterdam. The Embraer 190 is comfortable, friendly crew, flights on time. Good flights. Bear in mind when flying KLM cityhopper that bus transfer to terminal at Amsterdam is necessary.

### "Will never fly KLM again"
Worse customer service experience in 40 years of international travel. Arrived at Florence at 4:30 am for our 6:30 am flight. Delayed until 9:45 am due to weather in Amsterdam. No PAs about delay, found out on the board. Boarded and waited for 2 hours on the taxiway for winds to die down. Told flight was cancelled. Pilot and cabin crew were very apologetic. No problem with the decision to cancel - can't control the weather. It is now 4:30 pm, 12 hours after arrival at airport. Ground staff totally unorganized and incompetent. No KLM supervisor onsite. Still waiting in line to find out what arrangements are being made to get us home. At one point one person was handling the entire airplane after coworker decided to end their shift. The 5:15 pm flight to Amsterdam that was also cancelled have been taken care of. Those of us from the 6:30 am flight were told to wait. Some of the people on our flight who have been taken care of were not given hotel or transport even though they have to stay overnight. Against passenger rights. Will never fly KLM again! Words fail at how miserable this experience has been. The 1 point is for the pilot and cabin crew for actually caring.

### "fly again with them"
Newcastle to Oslo via Amsterdam on KLM. Flight went okay on our first leg, free drinks and snacks (very small bag of nachos), but all in all an okay flight. Amsterdam to Oslo was good, Flight crew happy and joking. Will fly again with them. Schiphol Airport is chaos though, and there is not a lot of info for transfering passengers.

### "old seats seem at least 20 years old"
When I booked this KLM flight, the plane which was due to operate this route for my travel day had the new business class seats. Unfortunately, KLM changed the plane a few weeks before the flight I was booked on. I ended up with the old seats, which seem to be at least 20 years old. They are very unconfortable in almost all positions and when you lay down, you have the face of your neighbour from behind above yours. The service was lousy and one of the steewardess was very arrogant. Food was below average for plane food and dessert was inedible. Wine offering was also very poor. For my next flight in Business I will chose Air France which has a much better product, even if both airlines belong to the same group.

### "food decent on long-haul flights"
Cabin staff great, and very good self check-in services for boarding passes and baggage drop-off. Long queues can be avoided this way. Food is decent on long-haul flights. Inflight entertainment good, but it could be better. Doesn't have that much to do with the selection of music and movies, but the old configuration that some aircraft still have (like the B777-200 on my JFK-AMS flight) you're dealing with older screens that definitely need an upgrade.

### "a good experience with KLM"
Madrid to Amsterdam with KLM. A quick, easy and friendly check-in at the airport for this 6am flight. The lounge opened at 4.30am, and still seemed to be setting up for the next half hour. Boarding was smooth and my economy style business class seat (middle seat left empty) had plenty of legroom. A tasty breakfast was served by pleasant cabin crew. The flight operated on time, and was a good experience with KLM.

### "return day flight was rather pleasant"
London to Bangkok via Amsterdam with KLM. My inflight entertainment system did not work for 7 hours of the flight - I was not the only customer with issues but staff were uninterested. I pressed the call button and it was not answered. were nowhere to be seen after the meal service and lights were left on for an excessive amount of time. They were off for only 3 hours of a night flight that lasted over 10 hours. We were told that landing cards for Thailand would be handed out 6 hours into the flight. I stayed awake to make sure I received one and they were finally handed out 1 hour after the announcement was made. We were woken up to be given snacks in the middle of the night. It was already difficult enough to sleep. There were no eye masks to hide the bright lights. Lights were turned on to full 2.5 hours before landing with no graduation to allow eyes to adjust. Food trays were not taken away for over an hour which exacerbated the difficulty in sleeping. The food tasted good however (special lacto-ovo vegetarian meal). We were delayed because of KLM cargo that needed to get on the plane. This apparently needed to delay our arrival by almost half an hour (gate to gate) with no explanation why this had not happened earlier, instead of at take-off time. Some staff seemed to speak poor English. The return day flight was rather pleasant, with friendly, thoughful staff and good food.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
KLM Calgary to Amsterdam return is quite possibly the worst flight. The seats are tiny the flight is always packed the food is awful. The plane layout makes you feel like you are crammed in like sardines. Ancient TV system so you can hardy see the screens with remote in arm rest and leg room restricted by massive box built in under the seat. The staff however are lovely.

### "food and drink served very good"
Budapest to London via Amsterdam with KLM, and the crew were friendly and happy to help.The cabin was very nice and the seats were very comfortable. We departed and arrived on time, and the food and drink served were very good.

### "I will avoid KLM and Delta in future"
Ground staff for KLM was unnecessarily unfriendly and insisted she weigh our carry-on although it was a tiny rucksack. We were well within the weight limit. On our check-in luggage one of the bags was 1.8kgs over the limit and the lady at the counter insisted we redistribute our luggage, although our second bag was more than 3kgs under the limit. To sum up, annoying, unfriendly and unprofessional experience, I had the feeling she was just trying to give us a hard time for nothing. I will avoid KLM and Delta in future due to this and other sub-par experiences in the past.

### "change from free luggage to surcharge a huge mistake"
The KLM change from free luggage to surcharge is a huge mistake, considering that KLM fares are still very high. Their meals onboard are often sub-standard, a cheap sandwich or some unknown mixture of pennes bathing in oil. Their wine is drinkable, but nothing to hang on the tree. Beer offered is their "national" Heineken. The seats are adjusted to let as many people sit in the aircraft, which means that people who have long legs or are wider than average can't sit comfortably. Their measure for leg room must be people of 1.70m (5.7f). Yes, you can pay for more legroom. Crew is professional and friendly, no complaints there. Ground crew smashed our luggage beyond repair, most airlines have deals with suitcase shops that a claim is dealt directly. But with KLM you have to send them photos, proof of purchase, a shop's confirmation that it's beyond repair, and ten other things to their HQ. The claim then takes months to be processed. On the positive side they give you extra refund to cover for exchange expenses, bank fees etc. To sum the experience I would say you get far better quality services by airlines like Ryanair and Wizz Air, considering the price. You pay for every service on those airlines, but the fare is also very low.

### "ancient business class seat"
São Paulo to Amsterdam with KLM, and haven't encountered this type of ancient business class seat in over 10 years. I really didn't know they were still in use. Rickety uncomfortable seating with no privacy whatsoever. Impossible to sleep, no where near flat, the angle is such it isn't possible not to keep sliding down. No flat TV screens, the old pull out type of TV. The food wasn't great quality either. The staff however are pleasant and helpful. Very surprised KLM are using this aged Business cabin to and from Sao Paolo. We will not be travelling with KLM again until their product is improved.

### "the seat quality was excellent"
Good service and professional staff on my KLM flights from Tokyo to Tel Aviv via Amsterdam. The Boeing 747-400 from Tokyo was a bit old, and the entertainment system outdated. The food was okay On the Amsterdam to Tel Aviv flight there were no no TVs at all, and this is a 4.5 hour flight. The seat quality was excellent and a lot of space for Economy class.

### "include KLM luggage allowance on the email"
It would be helpful to include KLM luggage allowance on the email flight overview they send you. It took half an hour at the desk as I was told my 29kg bag was overweight but if I split it in 2 bags I was hugely under my allowance of 2 x 23K. This is madness and there is nowhere in Norwich Airport to buy another bag which would have cost less than the £73 charge by KLM.

### "what I expect when flying intercontinental"
The flight from Toronto to Amsterdam was about what I expect when flying intercontinental. The food was nothing to write home about, but definitely edible. The seats on both the Boeing 747-400 and the Embraer EJ-190 were not comfortable. However, the inflight entertainment was great. I had my viola with me, which is in a case measuring about 30"x10"x5", so it does exceed their posted baggage limit. From Toronto to Amsterdam, they didn't raise a stink about it being in the overhead, which I appreciate, but from Amsterdam to Bilbao, the attendant pulled me aside when I boarded the plane and pointed me to a storage locker that was quite large. This was quite nice, as I didn't have to worry about another passenger getting angry at me for taking up lots of overhead space (it has happened), and I didn't have to worry about it falling out when the overhead was opened. Their flight attendants are very friendly and speak perfect English. Overall, KLM is a pretty good airline.

### "old business class seat far behind other airlines"
The KLM old business class seat on this flight was far behind other airlines. The 2x3x2 configuration does not offer any privacy, the seat is very uncomfortable, and sleeping is an ordeal. I was unfortunately seated in the mid row seat, which means you have to perform acrobatics to crawl over your sleeping fellow passengers for a toilet visit. IFE is good behind some other carriers. Crew was very friendly and professional. Food and drinks were up to standard. I would avoid KLM just on the basis of this poor old seating plan.

### "good service and nice food"
On my return flights from Amsterdam Schiphol to New York JFK I was pleasantly surprised by KLM. Plenty of legroom, good service and nice food. It was a shame the airplane wasn't equipped with WiFi. The IFE system was not as advanced as the one used by Emirates, but it offered enough for me.

### "product is a vast improvement"
We were connecting on from Delta Air Lines to KLM. Our flight arrived into Amsterdam at 11.45 am and we departed at 14.30, departure was on time and the Business Class seat was amazingly better than their product on the A330 they used to operate on this route. The meal was tasty - I ordered the lamb chop which was very good. IFE screen was of good size and quality and you can play the games on either the screen or the hand set screen. There was no WiFI but this product is a vast improvement on the last one. Service was excellent.

### "wonderful experience with KLM"
The wonderful experience with KLM started at the boarding gate, where the process was very organised and boarding was smooth and quick. We departed Singapore on time and arrived in Bali 20 minutes ahead of schedule. During the short 2hr 30min flight, we were served 4 course meal even though we were flying Economy Class. The inflight entertainment was good, and the seats were nice and comfortable, with a fair pitch.

### "budget product at full service price"
KLM provides a budget product at a full service price. You now have to pay additional for all hold baggage. Pay for seat allocation - except the centre seat. No inflight entertainment on 3.15 hour flight. Typical indifferent service. Food and wine cheap and nasty.

### "attendants nice and professional"
It was my first flight and I actually loved it! It was a 16 hour KLM flight with a stopover to Amsterdam. The food was excellent, most attendants were nice and professional. The seats were confortable, I was able to sleep a little. Loved the movies, really great selection. When I came back from Africa, in Amsterdam the plane was broken, and we had to wait 3-4 hours before another plane came. The plane they found was smaller so some people had to wait until the next morning for another plane, but KLM paid every expense. I was able to go in the smaller plane and instead of an 8 hours flight, they made it a 6 hour flight, so finally we were not that late.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
This KLM flight from Amsterdam to Manila via Taipei was okay, but not as enjoyable as the first one. The Boeing 777 was older, the inflight entertainment was really poor (with a tiny screen) and there was no socket to plug my laptop and my phone. That was extremely annoying and inconvenient for a flight longer than 10 hours.

### "cabin crew best I had come across"
Unplanned flight with KLM after scheduled flight was overbooked. Flight had to be booked over the phone due to the short notice, however it was easily done. Plane was a relatively old looking Boeing 777 but was comfortable. The visual and audio quality of the Inflight entertainment system was not the best, but had a good range of films and TV shows. Legroom in seat 38D was slightly restricted due to a small electrical box - however being on the aisle compensated for this. The food was fantastic, simple but wholesome and very welcome. After take-off Dinner/Light meal consisted of chicken wrap, couscous and cake. Breakfast was between French toast or omelette (which was very good) with fruit salad, bread and juice. I found the provision of water on this flight significantly better than other airlines which give you pots of waters with meals, and cups at other services, this often leaves me thirsty and so I bring extra water on-board. KLM provided bottles with the goodnight amenities pack and at meal service. The stand out feature was the cabin crew who were the best I had come across on my travels. Genuine, friendly and appeared to care that you had a good flight. The stand out feature and one of the reasons I would choose to fly KLM again long haul.

### "business class worth every cent"
I was offered a last minute upgrade to KLM's business class and it was worth every cent. Wonderful staff, excellent meals. Good IFE with a nice variety. I have previously flown Premium Economy with KLM which was also a good experience.

### "worth every penny"
Flew with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines from Manchester to Beijing via Schipol. Manchester to Amsterdam was on an Embraer E-190 that was late coming in but was turned around fast. Short flight on a small but comfortable aircraft, crew efficient and informative. Captain came in fast as lots of passengers needed to make connections. Mad dash across Schipol to make flight. I am biased I like the B747, and "Rio" looked magnificent in the afternoon sunshine. I paid the extra for the premium economy seat and its worth every penny. Long but comfortable overnight flight to Beijing. Food was good, nice G&T and a drinkable red wine. Snacks can be had at anytime. The combi Premium economy area was very civilised, the babies well behaved. I have a toddler daughter so I know what its like to feel like a lepper amongst passengers when you have a little one with you. KLM aircrew are often "more mature" but that makes them far better at helping family flyers. If you can pay the premium KLM is a far better and time saving alternative to flying via the middle east to get to the far east. Saw a last glance of "Rio " as I left the airport in Beijing. I will be sad to see these big birds go. Yes I know the A380 is bigger and I fly them too but the jumbo has soul. Few whinges? Why does a full price airline have a 23kg luggage limit when the middle easterners have 30kg? Its daft. People will plump for the bigger luggage carriers. They did allow me to take a large box with a bike (25kg) for free. I did take 120kg in luggage pre-booked with KLM but no porters to be found in Manchester or Beijing. Overall worth the extra for a sociable timed flight and not to transit through a hostile airport in the small hours.

### "great quality for the prices"
I flew KLM for the first time in April 2015 from Budapest to Osaka, via Amsterdam and I was very positively surprised by this airline. Especially the staff and the easy transfer at Amsterdam Schiphol. The food served on the flight was very good, and the inflight entertainment pretty diverse. Great quality for the prices they practice. Will fly again if I have the chance.

### "helpful when needed"
Flight from Singapore to Amsterdam (KL836). Did not notice any problems as I slept most of the time. Cabin crew very friendly and helpful when needed. Food is okay, Inflight entertainment not bad too. The plane looked like it was not cleaned before, but later I was told that the plane was coming from Denpasar (Bali, Indonesia) via Singapore to Amsterdam. For the price I paid, I would rather take a flight with a stopover and pay less. Overall good rating.

### "KLM exceeded my expectations"
Booked in advanced and managed to get the KLM return flight cheaper than easyjet and other low cost competitors. Cabin crews were efficient and friendly, although the flight was only 1hr long, the 2 crews managed to run a meal service that didn't seemed rush! The crew took time to offer my friend and I some tourist advice, which was much appreciated. Overall on the ground and in the air, KLM has exceeded my expectations, looking forward to fly with them, and would use them long haul.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Shanghai Pudong is is a very busy airport and flights tend to leave late. So was this flight, but we made up time on route, only 5 minutes late in Amsterdam. Nothing to complain about. Food was nice, service excellent and a sleep for a couple of hours. Enough drinks and snacks available (self service) through the flight.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Excellent flight with lots of surprisingly delicious foods, excellent staff and captain whom kept us informed about everything that was happening during the flight. Especially nice since whe we were flying through rough turbulance for an hour or so just above Mynamar, but we knew what we are getting into thanks to all the updates of the captain. Another small thing that I always fancy when flying with KLM, is that the food and drinks are served at the same time (as it's supposed to be with dinner) unlike many of the gulf carriers where I experienced many times that my meal was already finished when the drinks were served finally arrived. Inflight entertaimrnt system is good, but not excellent, definitly up to standaard with the airline industry. Overall great flight, KLM is my airline of choice. Product consistancy like no other airline.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
This review is about KLM ground personnel. My wife and I had cabin luggage only, in order to meet an appointment at London City Airport in time. Logical, I think. At the gate KLM ground personnel asked for passengers with a trolley to come to the desk and hand in their trolley. As I have flown in all kinds of planes, I knew that in smaller planes some put larger cabin luggage in a space in the back of the cabin. So my wife handed in her trolley. A few minutes later I saw her trolley sitting on the tarmac, ready to be loaded into the belly of the plane, together with the checked-in suitcases. The announcement made through the speakers had not mentioned that the trolleys would be loaded into the belly of the plane. I would not have handed in our trolley. I first asked KLM ground personnel and later instisted that they would give me our trolley that sat there visible just below us. The ground personnel would not even politely acknowkledge the justification of my request and started to handle a request of another passenger about luggage.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew New York JFK to Amsterdam on 777-300ER. Had hoped for newer aircraft but our plane was perfectly fine. Everything was clean on boarding, and the crew were welcoming from the start. The plane feels huge inside, although economy can feel a bit cramped in the 3-4-3 layout. I sat in a window seat, which felt far from the aisle. The seats are fairly standard for economy, anyone taller (i.e. more than 5'10") may feel a bit cramped but the pitch is generally OK. The IFE did feel a bit antique, but only crashed once due to me overloading it. The stewardess quickly reset the system when asked. The catering is better than most, albeit the choice was a bit meager (only 2 options for dinner and a small breakfast), but everything tasted fine and was served with a smile. No complaints about timings, besides a short delay on the ground at JFK, made up for by an early arrival in Amsterdam.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I flew with them for the first time in more than 4 years and once again, it was a nice experience. The price was good so I gave them a chance after being disappointed several times by a major Middle East airline. The flight was good. The food is very light but that's actually a good thing since it's a night flight (people just want to sleep). The service was very quiet and peaceful: light is not bright and crew are not running up and down. For that reason, I will fly with them again if I have a long haul night flight. The in-flight system was defective: the flight tracking system didn't work after we took off from Tapei, which was annoying in such a long flight but the crew was nice so that's fine. KLM now plays with a strong Dutch identity (Dutch snacks, Dutch symbols on the food packages and even on the plastic cups), that really gives a charm that made that flight even better than the one I had 4 years ago. The seats look very modern and there's more space between seats than what I experienced with the other major airlines in Asia. I guess that's because the Dutch people are so tall.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Despite fully booked flight, the FA's were personal and extremely hospitable and friendly on both legs: JFK-AMS and AMS-CPH. What a surprise. Even FA's were taking the time telling passengers about the Delft Blue design on the display on the tray and paper cups.Must say this airline have improved immensely through the last few years. Despite crowded flights I give my 5 this time - and look forward flying with KLM again soon as possible.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
We upgraded our seats due to limited availability however, seats were very cramped and uncomfortable especially for a long flight compared with other airlines. Also flight was very hot. Have always gone with KLM previously but was disappointed this time, not looking forward to the long flight back.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew KLM WBC (the new flat bed) from LAX to AMS seat 1A. Really appreciated the flight, very comfortable seat/bed with a lot of privacy. Slept for 6 hours. Cabin staff were very friendly and forthcoming, would assign a score of 9/10 for the overall flight/airline experience. However it got to a definite 10/10 the next day. I forgot a personal item in my seat. Got contacted by email by their lost and found service at AMS while waiting for my connecting flight in the KLM Crown lounge the next day. They asked me if I was missing something as they had found an item in my seat in that flight. When confirming this by email and having described the item, I received a phonecall and the lost item was personally delivered at the lounge. This is great customer service.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I had a pleasant stay onboard this KLM flight. I flew Economy Comfort, the extra legroom was really nice. The cabin crew wasn't very nice. They even were very rude to the passenger sitting next to me. The food onboard was a sandwich with scrambled eggs, it was okay. The aircraft arrived exactly on time, even though we had a 20 minutes delay at Barcelona.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
We flew the new Business Class with full flat beds. Slept like a baby. Excellent product and great cabin layout and colors. The staff, food and entertainment were also very good. KLM can definitely compete with this new product.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
New business seat was stuck and couldn't go down. My seat still had the old socks, earplugs and tissues from previous passenger. Food was Ok. Baggage got lost (3rd time this year). Baggage claim service was very friendly in Mexico but not the support line back in France.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
First time flying with KLM and I was very pleased. The premium economy service was very attentive. The crew were very pleasant and professional. When I realized the plane had no port with which to share my phone the cabin steward offered to charge it in the galley. When I woke up it was fully charged and in the seat pocket in front of me. The food was better than average, and love the homage to the Dutch Delft Blue on the meal trays. The seats were very comfortable with thick dense cushioning.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Our flight to Amsterdam in a Boeing 777 with the new KLM interior was very smooth and pleasant. Boarding was quick, and crew was friendly. Service impeccable and the food was generally good. I had a very good night's rest on the flat bed. The only issue was that the IFE wasn't working properly in my seat, and it took about an hour to fix. The KLM lounge in Amsterdam is large and spacious, with plenty of facilities and friendly staff. Boarding for Manchester was smooth. The plane had the European business class (Y seats with a vacant seat in the middle), but we had an excellent breakfast and crew was friendly and efficient. Both flights operated on time. Overall very good flights for the price.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
BOG-AMS-TXL return, flights on-time. Although KLM Business class cabin was refurbished, the 13-year old aircrafts looked old and tired. Reasonable lie-flat seating but not up to other airlines' standard. Very nice, friendly crew, the captain took time to chat with the passengers. Mediocre catering and wine offer, including an awful Brazilian red. Snacks on return very poor. As they are launching their flight to BOG and CLO, KLM are offering both Dutch and Colombian typical fare almost unedible. Nice amenity kits, good IFE and duty free sales. Smooth connections at AMS, despite our luggage being delayed for one day in the outbound leg, due to our short connection. Will fly KLM again if they provide reasonable Business class fares as it happened this time.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew World Business Class on outward flight and return from Amsterdam. There was a two hour delay, due to weather so not KLM's fault and the other due to toilets not working correctly which were thankfully fixed before departure. We were kept informed of the former delay via e-mail and a telephone call and as the plane boarded with a personal apology which was a nice approach. Service outbound was fantastic. Excellent food and choice of wines particulary the Dutch white, also the ruby port. The new flatbed seats I found spacious and speedily adjustable. The flight back was OK but lacked the personal and efficient element of outbound which is why I didn't give full marks. Staff friendly but I gained the impression staff just wanted passengers fed and watered as quickly as possible and many things were forgotten, from cognac to museli, everything was a rush. To confirm what others have said, boarding chaotic at Schipol which was nothing to do with security, just the insistence of moving children with associated buggies, people with special requirements and business class all at the same time. BA stagger boarding in that order which is more sensible as one might have priority boarding but you have to climb over everyone else in the waiting area which is so small. Didn't happen on European hopper flights however we flew economy as didn't see the point of an upgrade on a 45 min flight. Efficient, organised service from boarding to arrival. We had no problems with any of the reservation part and seat allocation. All in all a service and would definitely use KLM in the future.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I woke up at 5.30am and I had received an e-mail and a text message informing me of a delay. I headed to AMS where I checked in via a self-service kiosk and I dropped my bag at an self-service drop-off point. After that I had to go through security, it was the first time that I used the new central security filter at AMS which opened in June. It went really well. A nice and smooth process. AMS is being renewed, lounge 2 and the Holland boulevard were one big construction site. There were some improvised shops but it wasn’t the AMS standard, I was a bit disappointed that some facilities were not available, for example the Airport Library and the Aiprort’s mini Rijksmuseum. The boarding process took some time but it wasn’t too bad. When we boarded it was a bit chaotic, but the cabin crew were doing their best to get everyone seated as quickly as possible. We had a 2 hr 20 min delay due to a malfunction in a toilet and a late arrival of the aircraft due to delay in LAX. We took off smoothly from Amsterdam Schiphol. Headphones were distributed followed by a non-alcoholic drink and some salted cashew nuts. After that the crew distributed a hot towel. 45 minutes after departure, the first meal service commenced. There 2 options: chicken with rice or Italian penne pasta. I had the chicken and it was delicious. The meal came with a bottle of water and a drink of your choice, beers and wines were available for free as well. After the meal the cabin crew passed by to collect the empty trays and to serve a cup of coffee or tea with a liquor. Afterwards the lights went out to give passengers a chance to take a nap, immigration cards were handed-out. Half through the flight vanilla ice cream and a cup of water was distributed. The IFE on this B744 was a bit old and was  maybe a bit small but there is a large selection of films, music and TV programs.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Quick check-in at Vancouver and proceeded through security to Business Class lounge - clean and comfortable. Boarding was quick and efficient and the crew seated us and offered a drink (after take off) plus hot towels. Service throughout both flights was excellent and crew were efficient and helpful. Plane was clean, comfortable and everything worked. Schiphol airport was doing some construction and so there were a few delays, but on the whole the transfer was quick and fairly easy. Our return flight from Amsterdam to Vancouver again was great. Flight left on time and service, meals, and crew were wonderful. Arrived in Vancouver early and going through Canadian customs was one of the quickest and nicest experiences in a long time! !

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Daytime flight. The best cabin service I have experienced in years, including much better service than other airlines in business class. Great IFE, plenty of movies. Non stop cabin crew attention, good main meals, plenty of snacks and drinks available throughout the entire flight. Nothing but praise for this airline. Cabin crew to be praised.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Berlin to AMS was pain-free, a short hop in Premium Economy. Changing in AMS on a weekday morning was okay, too. Cabin of the A330 is extremely outdated and tired, I presume many airlines that fly to Africa use their oldest, clapped-out planes. The seat was not very comfortable, the screen for entertainment was tiny, perhaps 10 cm across. Other than more legroom, there are no perks in Premium Economy. Service was perfunctory, which is what I am used from KLM. What was really annoying was a medical emergency, which led us to divert to Luxor. As a doctor, I offered my help, but it appears the decision had already been made, and we stopped in Luxor for about 4 hours to offload a passenger. This went on for 2 hours, then a further two hours wait to get permission to continue. At 1 am we were in Dar es Salaam, stuck in an unknown city in the middle of the night, with no assistance from KLM whatsoever.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Return leg from business trip, Comfort Economy again. This was a night flight which departed late. Departure procedures in Dar es Salaam a complete shambles, about 90 minute queueing to leave the country, before that queuing outside the airport to enter, then another queue to check-in (you will need to be at the airport at least 2 hours in advance). No decicated queues for frequent flyers or Comfort Economy. Once onboard, the seats showed their age and lack of comfort on a night flight. In-flight entertainment system is very old, with ancient games, tiny screens, not easy to operate. Choice of films is not too bad. The food was, simply put, inedible. Hardly any drinks service on the night flight - or maybe I missed them as I was trying to sleep. Sleeping is barely possible, as the seats in Comfort Economy are still narrow, even though the legroom is okay. The cabin is noisy. Cabin crew impoite, even rude at times - did not feel welcome. Once in Amsterdam, we learnt that both our connecting flights (to different airports in different countries) had been cancelled. No help from ground staff whatsoever. We finally managed to change our bookings on the self-service machines and were "compensated" with a paltry food voucher for 5 EURO and 15 EURO for a 3 hour and a 7 hour delay, respectively. Finally, flight to Berlin was late and chock-a-block full. After a sleepless night and five hour wait I had to sit with bits of hand luggage on my lap because only one piece of luggage was allowed in the overhead bins. I am not going to fly KLM again if I can avoid it.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I was impressed with both flights. The Edinburgh to Amsterdam leg was comfortable and the cabin crew extremely professional. The flight to Dammam was also excellent. The seating was comfortable and I had ample leg room. The food and inflight entertainment was great too.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
The plane's interior was updated and nice. The food was the best I've eaten on any flight in economy flying from Europe to US. I was very impressed. Other than that the rest was average. There wasn't any real or major disappointments with the cabin crew but I didn't real feel extra special or overly accommodated for. It was just average. Other than that no complaints.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
KLM Business Class from Barcelona via AMS to DFW. Early morning flight started with KLM from Barcelona at 7.00am, Boarding was simple with two lines one for Business class other for economy. Once on the plane and departed morning service began with breakfast followed by coffee and juices. Food good and fresh compared to US carriers where the breakfast is usual not good. Amsterdam airport great undergoing a renovation at some parts. Lounge massive with two food area's and a huge selection of food for breakfast with good selection of liquor, and beer if wanted and coffee/soda/juices. KLM flight from AMS to DFW on the Airbus 330-200 seat old business class seats but the recline was enough for a day flight to DFW of nine hours. Service onboard was great food much better compared to US carriers along with dessert though KLM lacks in drinks offers with a limited selection of mainly wine and beer. Overall KLM has really good service in Business class, and once the A330 aircraft get the new business class seat the product offered will on par with others.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
YYZ-AMS-WAW and return. I usually fly to Europe with Air France but opted for KLM this time because of more suitable connection and the fact that they flew A330 (2-4-2 seats) rather than B747 (3-4-3). Had economy comfort seat (window) on A330 to AMS which gives you extra 4 inches of space, nice Indonesian-inspired meal, uneventful flight. Schiphol non-Schengen section under renovation and therefore confusing, but it is still one of the best transfer airports, though the lounges in CDG offer better food. Flights AMS-WAW-AMS were fine and on time. Return AMS-YYZ delayed 2 hrs and A330 replaced by B747, however, when boarding got upgrade to business so can't complain. New cabin layout and seats in C class, nice service, but surprisingly I found the economy meal tastier. KLM remains a solid, reliable airline. I wish they introduced Premium Economy class.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I have been flying KLM for the last 5 years, approx. 20-30 flight per year. The aircraft are getting on a bit however they are upgrading some interiors which makes a difference and I believe new aircrafts are coming in for long haul late 2015. I find Schiphol good with always something to do. KLM allow short changeover times so you don't have to hang around the airport for hours on end. The flights have been on time bar one recently. The staff have always been fantastic both on board and on the phone. I often need to change my flights at the last min and they have always accommodated unlike BA who want to charge you and give you a terrible seat etc.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Used to be my favorite as far as we consider this airline as fairly cheap but delivering what you paid for. But unfortunately, prices are now as expensive as the best Middle East or Asian airlines. Food is awful, no comment about the wines - the new seats are extremly unconfortable and seem to have been designed for short people. This airline policy is applicable for couples with no children. Only one guest is allowed, strict rule with no exception.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Boeing 777-300 seat was quite cramped but the amount of legroom and overall space is like many major airlines. The food was tasty and there is a box with different kind of bites placed in the galley throughout the flight. The captain provided the passengers with extensive updates twice throughout the flight. KLM  service is top notch and their cabin crew know how to handle situations very well.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I flew with KLM from NRT to AMS on July 3rd. The cabin was clean and the seat was very comfortable. Tasty meal was served properly both in timing and amount. Drinks and snacks were served frequently. Flight attendants were very friendly, but never officious. I didn't have to wait in a long line at the security check area thanks to the separate lane for "SKY PRIORITY".

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
A mixed performance by KLM. Arrived at Heathrow for a connecting flight to Amsterdam. Although checked in, there were clearly inadequate number of check in staff at Heathrow - just three dealing with KLM and Air France flights. A lot of passengers were travelling in groups and had a lot of luggage. The queuing times were excessive - was just glad I arrived early. Others had to jump the queue because their flights were due to depart in 30 minutes. The aircraft left late and there were operational problems with loading luggage at Heathrow. This meant the connection time at Amsterdam was very tight. However, it was a different story between Amsterdam and Tokyo with an excellent crew, One stewardess, in particular, went out of her way to provide me with refreshments throughout the flight - and this was economy!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
The business class seats on both legs of our flight were comfortable but not as good as CX, QA, EK or EY, they were great in the seating position but in laying down they became very narrow around the shoulders. The entertainment system though is far behind all competition and KLM really needs to work on the selection they offer, as for the food - instead of the normal 3 choices other airlines offer, KLM only give 2 but the portions are very generous and the taste is very good. Where KLM excelles is in the service, they make you feel welcome they are warm and serve with professionalism and respect. I will always prefer them for their personal touch.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
On our flight (KL1221) from Schiphol to Torp there was some trouble landing because of the heavy fog over Sandefjord. The captain tried landing three times before we turned to Gardermoen OSL to land instead. Although i wasn't at home until 5am, I am very pleased with all the information we got on our way, and I would just like to thank the Captain and crew for keeping us updated and answering questions. I will most definitely fly with KLM again!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
The ground crew were polite, professional, and cared about trying to make us happy. We had a baby, so we had to go to the transfers desk to print our boarding passes. They helped us bypass long lines so that we could make our connection on time. Because we were boarding from a connecting flight we weren't able to arrive early enough to claim the bassinet seating (there were lots of babies on the plane) but the flight hostess was able to find another seat for the woman sitting beside my wife, so we had a place to put out 6 month old instead of holding him the whole time. The plane was clean and comfortable, and the food was acceptably good for airplane food. The hostesses were very friendly, professional and presentable. I would recommend this airline.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Absolute chaos at check-in. Many passengers connecting to China and all with a full trolley of baggage (and more) to check in. Not all desks were staffed and the agent controlling access seemed to have lost heart and surrendered. It was a hot day and the aircraft was stuffed full of people so boarding was highly stressful. It was not great for anybody when stressed kids made their presence known. The cabin crew were of little assistance, seemingly just wanting to get home. I too wanted to be off this very badly managed flight. In contrast, my onward flight to Aberdeen was tranquil. I guess it's all down to KLM management of pressure.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Reserved and paid extra for an EconomyComfort seat with extra leg space 3 months before the flight. 3 minutes before boarding I was called to the boarding desk and was told that my seat was double booked, they put me in a cheaper Economy seat and was told I should ask for a refund myself after landing. The boarding was chaotic and took a long time, as it appeared more passengers had to change seats. The seat I was put in was the most cramped one on the plane. Once aboard the plane I told the purser about the situation, she refused to believe me and went out of her way to deny I even paid for an EconomyComfort seat. A nasty experience that ruined the positive holiday mood I was in. Food was so so: the classic choice between pasta and chicken/rice. Other cabin crew was friendly and helpful. Toilets were kept tidy and clean. Inflight entertainment somewhat outdated.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
We had a good flight, great service but the seats in this Boeing 777 were like KLM'S business class, somewhat austere. Our Boeing 777 outbound from YYC had power points and easily accessible USB. Some exec got cheap at KLM and we had to hunting on our hands and knees for the headphone jack which was buried in a strange place and no power points for our electronics. It was quite a sight to see business class passengers on their hands and knees trying to plug their headphones in. We are going to try Air France business class in the future and if that doesn't pan out we are switching back to Lufthansa. I suspect that Cathay Pacific, Korean and Emirates still have a far nicer business class with more perks for the same fare.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
My family and I recently flew from LAX to Copenhagen after a layover in Amsterdam. We returned about two weeks later on KLM, flying Copenhagen to Amsterdam, then on to Atlanta and finally LAX. Both flights were the smoothest we have experienced. The flight crews were attentive and professional. The onboard meals and snacks were pretty good considering it was on an airline. The only issue we had was the leg room on the flight over. The Boeing 747 had the worst of any plane we had been on. The Boeing 737 from Amsterdam to Copenhagen had more. Best of all was the flight from Amsterdam to Atlanta on a Boeing 777 - comfortable, with plenty of seat space and leg room. Overall, KLM did an outstanding job.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Paid for upgrade to business - it was somewhat disappointing. The new lie flat seats are great but service was under par. The welcome drink took a while to arrive, wasn't offered coat service. My carry on didn't fit in bin (upper deck, small bins), the flight attendent sent me to her colleagues in the back, but they were too busy, so I left the suitcase in the aisle, and it took about 30 minutes for someone to take care of it - not a very friendly experience in general. No particular attention to passengers asking about drinks, and serving wasn't good - food served with foil cover labeled "remove before serving", etc. I felt like I was in economy premium, rather than business. What mattered was the lie flat and the ability to sleep, but at this price, even for a discounted upgrade, it's not worth it.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew with KLM from Singapore to Amsterdam. I have tried to a avoid KLM due to previous bad experiences. This flight was nice surprise since KLM "economy comfort" was very good. Enough leg space and seats were not too bad. Food served during the flight was typical (chicken and rice for dinner and fruits and yougurt for breakfast). In fact only negative thing in this flight was extremely narrow aisles. Cabin crew bumped to passengers shoulders and elbows all the time and it is not their fault since their is absolutely not enough room to walk or serve food without touching or pushing accidentally passengers.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Very good service and quite good food. Crew very professional, went out of their way to try and solve customer's issues with a smile. AVOD was a bit tricky to operate and not nearly the number of choices available as on some carriers. The TV offerings were a little weak, the film offerings were a little better. Aircraft was clean and well maintained. The two biggest problems were the AVOD box under several seats in each row, which significantly impacted leg room if it was under the seat in front of you. Also, for some reason the armrests only raised to 45 degrees, making it difficult for a person in a center seat to get up to use the lavatory. Seat pitch a little tight for such a long haul.

CAI-AMS, May 12th. AMS-IAD, May 14th: Check in went smoothly and fast through sky priority, the Lounge was perfect, but again overcrowded. For boarding Sky priority is not very good as we were placed in an adjacent seating area to the Economy and the boarding was altogether with everybody on the same buses.

professional and very organized, it was A330 airbus that looked brand new and it was a pleasant flight. The day was spoilt with the endless immigration queues at Washington Dulles Airport, and an even longer one for the customs. It took me almost 3 hrs to pass all of this.

Travelled Glasgow-Amsterdam-Stockholm and return Amsterdam-Glasgow. Inflight very poor. Sandwich offered but on brown bread only also no choice of filling. Drinks offered were tea coffee/wine/juice-beer, I prefer a spirit but again nothing. I have travelled long haul with KLM (Hong Kong twice, South African once) and enjoyed excellent service and quality but short haul I would not use again, as well using the budget airlines.

Dublin - Zagreb route via Amsterdam. Return. Baggage allowance not clear because one of the route is operated by another airline. Aer Lingus. Phoned KLM they said check with Aer Lingus. Phoned Aer Lingus and were told check with KLM. Gave up just carried a small bag. Online check in not possible because one of the route operated once again by another airline. Clearly said on my ticket that food and drink included in all the routes but on Dublin - Amsterdam and Amsterdam - Dublin route I was told its a short trip so no food will be served plus its a pay as a you go service. The price I paid was the best around. Planes were clean. Check in was smooth. Unfortunately I have to fly the same route 3 more times this year. No other airlines price are so competitive. would love to fly this route with Lufthansa but they are overpriced. Overall KLM is a decent airline. Would recommend them but they are not perfect.

We came home May 22nd 2015 flight KL 695. We paid extra to have two seats only side by side with more leg room we ended up with three seats and were very crowded. Service was terrible put my light on for a coffee - 4 hours later still no one wanted to see how long it would take to get service. Food was awful the whole experience with KLM was terrible I understand WestJet will be starting flights soon from Canada to Amsterdam I strongly recommend you check them out.

First time with KLM. KL to Amsterdam on B777 Amsterdam To Abu Dhabi on A330. Both flights were full. The seats were typical economy so nothing flash. The cabin crew were really friendly and proactive throughout both flights. Water and or juice was offered quite frequently a courtesy bar area was available with drinks and snacks ie help yourself not that you needed it because staff were very attentive to requests. Food was ok with staff working well as a team when some options were short on supply. All flights were right on time. I flew on with them to and out and of Norwich. Anyone travelling into England might chose this to avoid Heathrow. I was in my hire car 15 minutes after arriving in Norwich. I would fly with KLM again.

In Amsterdam May 12th trying to get my boarding pass for my connecting flight to Kilimanjaro Airport. No reservation. Next kiosk no reservation. Tried both the Delta and the KLM flight #'s. Found KLM rep who sent me down to transfers who then tried it for me typing in both KLM and Delta flight #'s. No reservation so sent me on to Transfer rep who eventually found me and sent me back to a kiosk for seat assignment. Return trip from Kilimanjaro to Amsterdam I previously paid for Economy Plus seat upgrade with confirmation printed in hand and also on my Iphone. My seat 10J was also sold to someone else who checked in just before me. No other windows for the 12.5 hour flight so he finally gave me a window seat farther back. What a way to do business! Hopefully no KLM flights in the future.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I was travelling last week with my 90 year old and very infirm husband we were told at the airport that we were being put on standby and might not get on the flight which we had booked many weeks in advance (and in respect of which KLM had several times emailed us confirming our seat numbers)? We were told that it was KLM policy to overbook flights and that this was "in the small print". I am revolted by this policy. We had bought and paid for our tickets and received several email confirmations from KLM about this. I was travelling with somebody who was simply not physically fit to be transported to another city to catch an alternative flight (the suggestion which was made to us at the airport). If an airline sell tickets which people pay for in good faith and intend to oversell the flight so that these tickets will be meaningless this needs to made explicit and clearly spelt out to customers - not hidden in "the small print".

Flew with this airline on 5th May from Bristol to Mexico City via Amsterdam. Snacks and drinks on the short trip to AMS and then great cabin service food and entertainment from AMS to MEX. Much better than BA in my opinion. Would definitely use them again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I flew KL 791 AMS-GRU a flight of almost 12 hrs so Business Class was a huge plus and the free seat next to me gave me even more space - great! The downside was that I felt like being served without a personal touch why? 1) No second pre departure drink. 2) I was asked what I like to eat without receiving the menu first and the FA forgot to ask which appetizer I want (normally that is fixed). 3) During the flight it was hard to get snacks and drinks (I had to walk to the economy class FA's and ask them). 4) In preparation for landing I had to bring my hand luggage back in the overhead bins on my own (FA asked me to get up and do it while she was standing next to me without helping me). The good stuff was the taste of the food and the good wines/drinks as well as a comfortable lie flat seat with an angle (only a few of the 25 KLM 777 are lie flat without an angle today). Speaking about the FA's on board they where always smiling and the economy FA's have been very helpful fast and with a personal touch. I slept a pretty long time and it was all in all a good flight - well they could do more on the service part.

BHX-DOH and return. KLM was convenient for me as I live in Birmingham and could therefore travel to Doha via Amsterdam without the need to travel down to London. The ticket price was also the cheapest available for this trip. The short hop from Birmingham to Amsterdam only takes about an hour but the 06.00 departure always serves a cold breakfast sandwich with tea coffee or juices. The layover in Amsterdam was 1 hour 55 minutes giving more than enough time to make my connection. The flight to Doha was not full whereas most Qatar Airways flights are as most of the passengers will be transiting. Once airborne the passenger next to me was offered the choice of moving seats so that we could all spread out a little making the journey much more comfortable. The IFE is adequate but the screen a little small though there is a good range of entertainment. On the outbound flight there were only two options for economy main course but the food was reasonable as airline food goes. All flights departed and arrived on time the crew were very good and I was pleasantly surprised that despite being the cheapest choice for my route KLM provided a service that I was more than happy with. I will look to see if I can get to my destinations via Amsterdam with KLM in the future and recommend for value for money.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Our first flight on KLM. YYC to AMS. Since it was an 8 hour plus flight we flew business class. The aircraft was a newer Boeing 777-200 which for reasons that evade me did not have sequential seating (ABC etc). We booked our seats on-line and thought we were sitting together which upon boarding we discovered we were not. This happened to 5 other couples as well. The flight attendants were reasonable and everybody affected were willing to swap seats even though business class was a full bus to Amsterdam. The meals were tasty and there lots of snacks. My one beef is that KLM should monitor their cleaning contractors more closely. I lost some change and some items from amenity kit under the pod. In the course of reaching underneath I found all sorts of goodies which could have been vacuumed up. I enjoyed the flight and the lie flat bed even though flying east and trying to sleep is a Herculean effort. I recommend KLM and will gladly fly with them again. One last caveat: I am old school and believe that one should fly the national airline within reason to the country you are visiting. Flying discount airlines is a recipe for disaster and personal misery. I cite the most vilified Air Canada Rouge as an example.

AMS-DUS-AMS two short hops on nice Fokker 70. AMS-DUS: all non-Dutch speaking crew felt a little strange on a KLM-flight. Efficient service on a short hop: water and some nuts. Good information from crew. Flight back was delayed. Crew announced which flights could be caught and which couldn't. Very good in my opinion since passenger know what they're up to. Professional crew handled all questions. Delay because of fog but there was hardly any fog to be seen at Schiphol.

We recently flew short haul from Manchester (UK) to Amsterdam return fro a short trip. The planes were 737-700 on way out and -800 on return. Planes were clean even though the turn around time was quick staff was friendly and smiling served a quick snack packet with a choice of a drink on this under an hour flight! both the flights were on time and we didn't feel the stress of flying. Recommended.

Amsterdam to KL aboard 777-300. This was probably the best business class flight of my life to date. The seats were comfortable and reclined to a full flat bed parallel with the floor not on an angle!). It was so clean and smartly laid out. The entertainment system looked brand new was high quality and featured something for everyone without being annoyingly edited. Service was very attentive and friendly. The soup entree was something of a revelation and I was surprisingly keen to get the recipe. The main was fairly good and after settling down with a bit of cheese and dessert wine from the trolley I slept for about 7.5 hours straight. The power plugs headphone outlets and a little shelving cleverly located behind the right shoulder and a nice divider from your neighbour. Really happy signed up for their frequent flyer program. Lounge in Amsterdam was fine and large with some surprisingly nice food on offer.

April 4 Toronto to Nuremberg via Amsterdam. Old style 2x3x2 seating but comfortable. Staff were first rate. Travelling with my mother who's is 95 and has a serious gluten allergy. Her special meal was adequate my meal was adequate. Meals out of Toronto are always poorer than out of Amsterdam or Paris. Somehow KLM seems to have nicer wines that Air France even though they are one and the same now. Entertainment was good with a side choice of movies and tv.

KL808 MNL-AMS 8 April 2015. Bought an upgrade with FB miles which is pretty affordable when you have the N Booking class of Eco fare (Middle of the week the Business Class often has spare seats). Since KLM moved to T3 the service at the airport has greatly improved! FA's as usual are very friendly attentive and considerate and the flight is always on time with a consistent service. The only downside of this flight is the stop in Taipei which by law oblige passengers to disembark and board again. Flight without issues despite the older Business Class seats (which should be replaced urgently). KLM has the convenient flight schedules to/from Asia with no change of plane in the middle of the night so you arrive fresh and ready to work in AMS. Had 2 music instruments at check-in in Manila and the ground crew proposed to load them by hand to avoid breaking and they were delivered at the special luggage in AMS (Ok the Platinum level helps but still). Despite the price a bit above competition i will continue fly KLM to the Philippines to enjoy the free EcoPremium upgrades and best flight schedules available from AMS.

Three recent flights: AUH-AMS-NCL-AMS-INC all good no problems. AUH-AMS was quite comfortable being a night flight all was very quiet AMS-NCL short hop across the North Sea very pleasant cabin crew on a smooth flight. NCL-AMS again no problems. AMS-INC was a night flight the cabin crew were exemplary and diligent in their duties making for a very comfortable flight. The food was very good and service was excellent although the World Business class doesn't have individual cocoons like the middle eastern airlines the seats are more spacious and overall more comfortable. I can certainly recommend KLM.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Rio to AMS in EcoComfort. KLM asks for absurd prices for the upgrade in this case approximately one third of the full return fare of just one leg upgrade. Got seat 14A last seat in the Economy Comfort section which on KLM is not cordoned off from ordinary Eco section. I usually opt for a window seat so as to be able to lean against the wall to catch some sleep. This seat and I trust 14K as well suffers from a major design flaw. It misses a window and when it reclines the pax head levels off with the window of the rear Eco seat making it impossible to lean against the wall. Trying to fill the void with a pillow won't help either because the pillows provided are just too tiny for that. Moreover probably due to being in the last row in the EcoComfort section the seat does not recline as much as other seats in the section. Understandably so obviously because if it did it would leave too little space for the Economy seat behind. My clear verdict is that this seat is not worth a dime let alone the absurd price asked and paid for it. The fellow passenger behind me in row 15 made a better judgement. He saved the upgrade money and had 3 seats for himself alone to lay down and doze off while I was trying to find the least painful position to close an eye on an 11 hour flight. As if the dismal seating were not enough the service was truly KLM unworthy. Flight left around 9.15pm and it took 1hr 30 mins to start dinner service. Food itself was very much inedible. The flight attendant assigned to my section was very unfriendly in fact bordering on obnoxious. All in all one of the worst experiences I have had with KLM. An inferior seat compounded by a dismal service.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I flew from IAD-JRO via AMS round-trip four legs of 7+ hours each. The food and service are decent enough perhaps slightly better than United. However their aircraft are certainly ageing and there is no aspect of the airline that could really be qualified as "excellent. Further they actually prevented me from accruing airline miles with a partner carrier something generally unheard of. Apparently this is because my flight was "discounted" despite carrying a four-figure price tag. Most legs were also delayed. I have flown on all of the other large Western European carriers and would generally recommend virtually all of them before KLM.

LHR-AMS round trip in economy comfort. KLM flies from T4 at LHR which is so quiet by comparison with the others. Everything worked like clockwork: bag drop boarding departure on time. Lovely crew on board the 737-900 and the economy comfort seats are definitely more spacious and with a good recline. Return leg was very similar: fast bag drop (with the hi-tech DIY machines) easy boarding (although remote stand this time) friendly crew on time departure and the economy comfort seats were actually business class seats on the Embraer 190. All round good job and I would definitely fly KLM again.

MUC-AMS-GIG on B738 and B772 aircraft. All flights on time. The long haul flight to Rio was even 40 min early. Crew was friendly and attentive and made several drink rounds. Food was good and plenty too. My complaint is the very uncomfortable seat on the B 777-200. I like KLM and will fly with them again but they definitely have to update their economy seats on their B772.

I traveled from Nuernberg to Dubai via Amsterdam Business Class on KL1888 connecting to KL429 on 28th February and had two exceptionally enjoyable flights with excellent crew service and catering. The one hour flight to Amsterdam was with KLM Cityhopper on an Embraer 190. The crew were attentive and jolly and the meal a salad was excellent. The connection at Amsterdam was easy and despite being just over one hour was not a rushed one. On board the Boeing 747-400 I was seated in 1A (a seat by itself). The Purser and crew in this cabin were excellent and I truly was pampered. The Captain came to me as a high level frequent flyer while on the ground at Schipol to pass on his thanks to me for choosing KLM. The meal service was high quality and very good with wine and smiles available throughout.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Booked flights with KLM for our honeymoon 5 months in advance including reserving seats. When we came to check in we found our seats had been changed and we had been seated far apart on all 3 flights from Cancun to Leeds. We had not been contacted to tell us of this and so were stuck without any option and no time to alter the flight. Spent hours on phone to their customer service team but completely unable to help. Eventually had to pay additional fare on one of our flights to sit next to my wife on our honeymoon despite us previously booking seats next to each other. No apologies no suggestion that they would refund the additional fee paid. The outward bound flight from Amsterdam to LA was on a 747 that is in serious need of updating. uncomfortable rock solid and narrow seats with very little leg room. They ran out of one of the dinner options before they got to our seat no apologies or explanations just put in on our table and said 'here is your dinner' didn't even say what it was. As it turns out it was bland and terrible. Stewardess became quite stroppy when complained at lack of choice of meals and made it seam like she was performing heroic acts to try and get an alternative meal. Inflight entertainment has much less choice than competitors and the technology is dated and slow with poor picture quality. Thoroughly unimpressed throughout and would not use again. changes in service are sometimes unavoidable but poor manners and customer service is unacceptable.

KL1158 KL0643. May 20 2014. We flew from Gothenburg Sweden to New York JFK via Amsterdam.

The staff were genuinely friendly and made the whole trip a brilliant experience. I would gladly fly them again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew Business Class from NRT to BCN (via AMS) in seat 4E of the updated 747-400 aircraft. Besides this plane being ancient and the fact that I felt sorry for all the people by the windows with no direct aisle access I had a terrifically smooth flight. I had heard about and seen photos of odd dishes served but not on this flight. All food throughout the flight was delicious plentiful and served on interestingly designed dishware. Previously I experienced some plastic items but not this time. The AVOD was OK but did not have as recent offerings as their partner Delta and the quality of the large screen was milky. The seat was surprisingly soft and was comfortable in any position including lie flat. The toilets were cleaned throughout and FA were always available in the galley with smiles. The FA were remarkably genial and good at their jobs. There were two toilets dedicated to all of business class and I never once saw an economy passenger try to enter. Overall I loved my flights. The connection on a 737-700 was more of the same with continued good service and food though the intra-Europe seats are not that comfortable.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Excellent flight crews but horrible customer service. Flew IAD to AMS to LYS and had attentive and friendly flight crews. But when checking in on-line saw banner advertising 80% business class and upgraded for IAD-AMS. At IAD learned that I had been ticketed business class only AMS-LYS which is not what I had bought. Of three customer service reps at IAD only one spoke passable English. That one explained that he could not change my ticketing and issue a refund but charged me $64 extra to have two seats by themselves. At AMS friendly customer service also told me they could take money but not issue refunds and could not change seat assignments. Back at home after my trip I called KLM which transfers you to Delta customer service whose recording says it's 2-3 hours to talk to a customer service rep. On-line refund app allows you 200 characters to state your case and (per an annoying pop-up banner) allows no punctuation. Took 40 minutes to submit my refund request. So I would give their in-flight crews the highest rating but their customer service the lowest.

LHR - Cape Town via Amsterdam. Because my wife and I are tall we purchased seats in the 'Economy Comfort' zone not cheap at £130 each but money well spent for a trip of 11.5 hours. The flight experience was as good as it could be. The crew were friendly and attentive offering plenty of food and drinks. The entertainment offered on the 777-200 was a bit limited but there was enough to keep us amused. It's the first time was have used KLM for long-haul and based on this trip we'd be happy to use them again.

Amsterdam to Bangkok Business class. Booked seats 9 months before travel and selected seats. On check in day found computer had decided to sit us on opposite sides of the aircraft: as it was our 40th wedding anniversary celebration didn't go down well. Eventually managed to get two seats together. Boarding at Amsterdam was a bit chaotic. Aircraft was B777-300: unsure of the age of the plane but business class cabin in my opinion looked drab and dingy when compared to say Qatar. Seats were OK and everything worked. AVOD worked but choice of movies was definitely limited. Food choice was also limited and wine selection was restricted. General comfort was OK. The really good aspect of this flight was the cabin crew. They were extremely attentive and welcoming especially the senior purser and they were all very professional. In spite of that I will not be considering KLM again especially as the flights undertaken do not appear to have been added to my Flying Blue account.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Bangkok-Amsterdam in world business class. Boarding at Bangkok was OK. Travelled in seats 77a and 77b on 747-400. This cabin is reasonably laid out but the decor reminded me of early thirties Odeon cinema: rather lifeless and lacking warmth. Seats were OK and everything worked although the headrest was non adjustable. AVOD worked but limited choice of movies. Toilets were clean and had a good range of toiletries. Food was OK not outstanding although compared to the outward journey it was better. As on outward journey the cabin crew were excellent and went out of their way to ensure that wherever possible they made the journey as comfortable as possible. I can't say that I was over impressed with KLM and would not travel with them again I would use Air France.

CGK-AMS-LHR-AMS-CGK. Took 4 flights with KLM in one week first leg is the long haul CGK-AMS with a Boeing 777-200 unfortunately KLM is still in the middle of refitting the cabin of B777 and we still get the old plane with very small PTV with blurry picture. Paid for Economy Comfort for this leg and got the first row bulkhead seats which has tremendous legroom. In flight service is good and friendly but the hard products really needs to be improved. Second leg AMS-LHR in a very old and small Fokker 70. KLM should already retire this type of aircraft but they did maintain the plane well it was clean and in good condition. Only the noise of the jet engine really bothering us as we sit all the way in the back (Fokker planes has the engines near the tail of the aircraft) luckily the flight to London is only 45 minutes. A cake and drink service is provided during this flight. Third leg London Heathrow to Amsterdam in a Skyteam livery Boeing 737-900 good legroom and service is similar as the AMS-LHR where we get a cake and a drink. Last leg AMS-CGK with a stopover in KUL also in an old non refurbished Boeing 777-200. Good thing the crew really performed well and deliver prompt and good service most of the time. Hopefully KLM is refitting their Boeing 777 flights quick enough as their fare is quite competitive and quite satisfied with their inflight service only hard products need improvement.

Glasgow to Johannesburg via Amsterdam return. First flight in the morning at 06.00 on a 737-700 on the short flight to Amsterdam. The next flight to Johannesburg was on a 777-300 sitting in the aisle seat in the middle row of four which was comfortable and had enough room and it was the same on the return flight too. On both flights there was nobody beside us so my wife had three seats to stretch out and sleep. The flight back to Glasgow was on an Embraer 190. The crews on all the flights were excellent on the short flights we received a sandwich/snack with coffee and juice and on the long haul flights we received a very tasty hot meal a liqueur with coffee ice cream and the crews came around with plenty of water and juice to keep us hydrated. For economy class the level of service was very good and will happily fly with KLM again.

KLM Asia: Was an interesting flight and was glad to get to the destination in the end! Flight was delayed in leaving due to a crew change pilot then took a wrong turn on the run way and we were stuck waiting for a while. Most of the passengers were just stuck waiting in their seats - the crew had not passed around the headsets so there was nothing to do. Had pressed the service button while waiting to get a set but the crew just stayed in the galley talking to each other (not in their seats waiting for take off). Once we left the IFE was good food was ok - they were serving cups of coke but not cans - although if you asked for a Heineken you got a can?

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew from SIN to AMS return. Very poor economy class seat especially for intercontinental flights above 10 hours. Seats are extremely squashed (not sure why KLM adopted a 3x4x3 seat layout when other long haul airlines rarely do). Recline is absolutely horrendous for an overnight flight - the seat was definitely not suitable for a night's sleep maybe only a short 30 minutes nap. Furthermore KLM's economy class tickets are not cheap - merely cheaper than top notch Singapore Airlines by 120 euros. Therefore I do not get why KLM is so cheapskate to pack so many people in economy class on very poor quality seats. The seats are so cramped that passengers have so much difficulty getting in and out of their seats to use the lavatory! That said the service was good and the flight attendants were meticulous and more than happy to walk around offering snacks and drinks every hour even when passengers are asleep. Nonetheless never on this airline again for long haul flights maybe a short 2-3 hour one.

I had seat 1A a single seat which was comfortable offered plenty of personal space and was quiet.

Everything about the flight went well from check-in to arrival in Surinam. I like this new KLM product and will be back to try it again!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew from Seoul/Incheon to Amsterdam on a midnight flight and couldn't be happier with how the staff handled us. We were travelling with a 2 year old but they made sure we had everything we needed (probably so the other passengers wouldn't have to endure the rath of a 2 year old but nonetheless) and we ended up having a very pleasant flight and didn't bother anyone else on the plane. We had seats at the bulkhead which have some extra legroom but compared to Air China Southern who we flew back with on a codeshare the plane was very cramped considering the average Dutch person is quite a bit taller than the average Chinese person. Overall though very happy with the flight on time despite bad weather and especially the crew who are very friendly and helpful.

Flew with KLM Business Class from London Heathrow via Amsterdam to Dubai. Check in at the Sky Priority desks was quick polite and seamless. FastTrack was quick and the Skyteam Lounge at Terminal 4 Heathrow is excellent. Boarding was efficient with priority very clear for Sky Priority passengers. The short flight to Amsterdam was very good with a high quality snack and very friendly crew. Arrival at Schipol was 20 minutes early. Unfortunately Schipol Airport is undergoing refurbishment which makes it something of a mess but the lounge was welcoming and not too crowded. Boarding from Gate E7 was very disappointing. It was a mess. Everyone had to go thru a security check and the queues were long. Then once thru security it was standing room only. Boarding was just a rugby scrum as people tried to get out of the claustrophobic boarding area. On board the Dubai flight the crew were very welcoming. Departure was on time and the on board product was very good. I am used to the KLM Business Class seat and while it may not be a flat bed it is fine for the approx. 6 hour flight to Dubai. Food was as usual of a high standard as was the overall cabin service. I have been loyal to KLM for many years and that loyalty will continue.

KL808 7 Jan 2015. KL807 25 Dec 2014. I have been flying KLM rather regularly now since I need to maintain my Flying Blue membership. Sadly I still miss my Miles and More days especially flying Lufthansa. Like Lufthansa KLM is indeed reliable. But it is bland - or blander if one doesn't think highly of Lufthansa. My last flight with KLM - long haul to MNL and back to AMS was ok but the business class seats were the old ones. Service was rather poor as the flight attendants designated to and fro TPE (both) failed to deliver on my request for a drink and when followed up would say that they can no longer serve any drink. The lounge in MNL is awful. And the stop in TPE wastes passengers' time.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
What can I say about long haul KLM? A true tale of extremes: Pros: Value for money (only £560 return ABZ-SIN via AMS). Lounge at AMS (free food drinks wifi and showers via Petroleum Card). Food and Beverage onboard was to a surprisingly good standard for economy airline food and freely available. Staff were attentive and helpful. Cons: Seat didn't recline anywhere near as much as it does in any other airline Ive flown with and felt really cramped - I found this odd given the Dutch are the tallest in the world! IFE was so dated and a limited poor selection of music films and TV. Cabin decor is dull. All in all not too bad but the cons niggled away at me.

I travelled YYC-JNB return. They made the 22 hour journey enjoyable! KLM staff are professional and friendly my seat was comfortable the plane was clean and the food was good. My only complaint is the lounge at AMS. What a waste of time and load of unnecessary aggravation. Crowded staff ignored me and I never did get my much needed shower. I didn't even bother with it on the trip home and just did a modified sponge bath in the public bathroom with wet wipes.

Stockholm - Amsterdam - Nairobi return. The outbound journey was very pleasant with everything going very smoothly and the comfort in terms of seating food and entertainment was just fine. However when going back home we were notified that our flight was cancelled for unclear reasons that KLM did not want to tell us (we still haven't gott any explanation more than two months later). We got a less comfortable alternative journey home which worked out alright. I guess cancellations can happen but the way KLM handled this one makes me a bit hesitant to choose them again.

Return flights from BRU to YVR via AMS after New Year. BRU to AMS flight delayed due to late arrival of incoming aircraft by 15 minutes we boarded the plane Captain was there to greet all pax upon boarding. Then captain took PA to inform us of further delay by 30 minutes as Schipol Airport have strong winds and to delay take-off in BRU until weather in destination cleared. Most pax including me had tight connections but again managed to catch onward flight. KLM is a very efficient airlines when it comes to baggage handling with tight connections. Food and drinks offered are ample and nothing to complain about. What amazed me is during second meal service 2 hours before touchdown in YVR I asked the purser for coffee but responded that it will be offered after the meal service are all done and after an hour she still recall that I asked for a coffee given the flight is totally full and very busy.

Flew from YVR to LHR via AMS and it was eventful one as cabin crew dealt with medical emergency 10 minutes before scheduled touchdown in AMS. Captain asked all pax to remain seated for 20 minutes but still managed to catch my onward connection. Service by flight attendants are warm and friendly food offered for dinner and breakfast were sufficient and tasty. Rounds of water and juices offered very frequently between meals even though snacks and drinks are available at the rear of the cabin.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
BKK-AMS B747 in the updated business class. Despite booking a specific seat and confirming it 3X I did not receive the seat. This was unacceptable and the airlines response was sorry too bad. Not the most intelligent way of treating a business class client. Check-in was disorganized and time consuming which was very odd for BKK because I have never experienced this at BKK. Part of the problem is that there is a scrum approach to check in. Boarding was equally disorganized and unusually unpleasant for business class on a BKK long haul. The plane departed late and arrived late but the Captain's honest explanation made it a non issue. The professionalism carried through to the on board service crew who were some of the most cheerful and efficient FAs I have experienced. Meals were disappointing as they were uninspiring and overly salty. Beverage selection was decent. The new seat left me with a sore back after 12 hours. KLM missed an opportunity to catch up with airlines such as Cathay EVA and ANA as the new seats are nothing special and still leaves KLM as a class below the aforementioned airlines. The amenity kit while nice looking was basic and again not as useful as Asian carriers no slippers were provided which is unusual on an Asian flight. Nor was I able to get a newspaper. First time on a long haul flight where newspapers were not available to me in the cabin. IFE was varied and ok although the map program is as bad as Air France's and not very informative. Overall it was a generic flight that got me where I had to go safely. The Dutch flight crew were excellent while the Air France/KLM ground crew in BKK were mediocre. I would not recommend KLM as a carrier on this route unless a direct flight to AMS was required as there are much better options available with the Asian carriers.

Abu Dhabi - Amsterdam - Billund. Flight crew were ok. Not very helpful at times. Food was below average. Toilets were not very clean and my seat was Broken! Entertainment system out-dated and on occasion had ear piercing noises. Wont be booking with them again.

Mexico City - Amsterdam B747-400 Combi Check-in was very efficient the flight was delayed 10 minutes. Food wasn't really good Crew were friendly and very professional IFE was good with lots of recent movies and music. Flight was good overall with just the delay and the bad food.

CPH-AMS-LIM and return in November 2014. All flight were on time or a little below schedule and on all flights the staff were friendly and informal - a nice experience as usual. Food was OK nothing very fashionable and drink service as expected (although on return flight no vodka for Bloody Mary was available). IFE good especially - as expected - in audio rock music section which in KLM is among the best in the air. The only complaints are about the seating in B777-300ER. Formerly I have flew the 777-200 with 3x3x3 option and found that very comfortable. The 3x4x3 is not ideal. You could for a small fee get slightly more space for legs but not broader seats and the new arrangements are both narrow and hard. Paradoxically seats in the short-haul B737 are much better. But KLM offers in other aspects great service and often good prices.

Comfort Plus section is a major disappointment. Seats are narrow extremely uncomfortable and offer actually less value than some economy seats. As much as possible I will not choose KLM for future flights. I have flown Air France's and British Airways' Premium Economy classes and they are much better.

AMS-BUD return. Decent price of 110 euros. Both flights on time airplanes were clean and cabin crew were friendly and spontaneous as usually with KLM. Was very nice to see how the company is trying to become more 'green' sandwich on the inbound leg was with free range chicken and on the outbound with special cheese and cream cheese from the north of the Netherlands. When collecting the rubbish everything was neatly sorted in to paper-plastic- metal bins. Seat just like any other European airline you can live with it. Biscuit +tea/coffee after the meal is a nice touch. KLM is decent airline and I would recommend their European flights.

Flew LHR to AMS then AMS to KIX Osaka. Check in at LHR was fast and efficient good fast track through customs. The lounge at T4 was clean spacious and bright. Had a very nice English breakfast. Flight to AMS was perfect considering the very high winds with no delays left and arrived on time. Skyteam lounge at Schiphol was large with plenty of comfy seating with bubbles wine and spirits and snacks. One of the nicest lounges I have visited. Again the flight on 777-200 was on time even a little early pushing back. Although the seats were the older style seats found to be quite comfortable. the recline was not as much as I hoped but still got 5 hours sleep. The staff on board were nothing but accommodating friendly and very efficient chose the Japanese menu to get me off to a good start even had great sakai on board. The return from KIX to AMS was good with a fast check in and efficient pass through customs (although no fast track was offered). The lounge is small but very comfortable with some odd seats looking out over the runway. Flight home was on a 777-300 which had better seating than on flight out. Again the staff were excellent funny and friendly. Could not ask for more. The food was well prepared tasty and very hot. The cabin was almost empty which meant could spread out. Got at least 6 hours of perfect sleep. The flight home from AMS to LHR was on KLM city hopper. Very small plane and it was packed. The seats are no different than those in economy and would in future not bother with Business on this service. To be fair flight only 45 minutes so small seat not a problem. All in all an excellent service from KLM - I would definitely fly with them again.

BOS to BHX via AMS. We booked in advance but were informed a couple days later that the second leg of our journey was cancelled and that we were rebooked on a much later flight. A sensible connection was available but we were told that it was impossible to make. When we took the flight we made it to earlier connection with plenty of time to spare but were told it was now impossible to transfer. Even with an eight-hour layover it was impossible to transfer to another other flights because of our baggage. The transfer desk was extraordinarily curt “Impossible” and “No” were all we got. Our rebooked flight gave us separate seats and we were offered the option to change for €10. Shoddy treatment all in all.

My wife and I flew from Singapore to Bali on 23rd December 2014 - never again. First problem was with an officious male steward who although I knew where my seat was insisted on looking at our tickets telling me that was why he was stood there and then proceeded to direct us to the starboard side of the plane rather than the port side where our seats A + B were which resulted in us having to walk on down the plane on the wrong side and then cut through and then try to walk back up the plane against the flow of passengers to get to our seats. Second problem was on our return flight to Singapore on the evening of the 27th all the passengers were hanging around for hours at Bali airport as there was a problem with the plane. Not a problem until we heard that the flight was cancelled and that we would be moved to hotels. No one who could speak English or Dutch was available to liaise with the passengers to advise us of the arrangements. The crowd sort of drifted towards the exit but no one came to tell us about reclaiming our baggage or times of the buses etc. We then drifted towards to baggage reclaim hall down some service steps and then had to find where the cases were coming in. We then drifted towards the exit and then the fun started. The buses turned up again with no explanation and we were trampled on by the Dutch in their efforts to get on the buses. We eventually got on to a bus. but had to stand with our luggage dumped along the aisles. We then were again trampled on by them in their effort to get into the hotel so we stood back to let them fight it out. We then eventually got our room but no mention of how we were getting back to the airport the following day. We did get a phone call from KLM telling us we needed to be at the airport first thing in the morning to get a flight with Silk Air. We got a taxi back and thankfully the flight went OK no thanks to the very poor communication skills shown by KLM. Problems arise and safety is of course paramount but if there was some one there who could lead the tired passengers through the situation and keep them informed the matter would have been far less traumatic instead it was the blind leading the blind.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flying from Hannover (Germany) via Amsterdam to Sydney (Australia) and had booked a cityhopper flight to Amsterdam a day prior to the intercontinental flight to spend a day in Holland for business as well as personal. That flight KL1904 HAJ-AMS got cancelled (no early info no reason given) and the way the KLM staff (incl. agent in Hannover) handled information assistance rebooking was terrible. Unfriendly not knowledgeable uninterested - passengers were treated with a "don't know can't do take it or leave it" attitude. This is being continued at Amsterdam airport where no interest or customer focus is shown (ie. by lounge staff) when after all I am a day late (having missed all appointments in Holland). KLM is cheap and nasty. If nothing goes wrong quite acceptable but customer service leaves a lot to desire that includes their website and phone service.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-PTY and return. I flew with KLM for the first time. The reason was the price and the flight schedule. Departure was late because of the fog. The captain informed us well and during the flight they gave information about the connection flights in PTY. Onboard the seat felt very narrow. It was onboard of a 777-300ER. Not much choice on the IFE but for me it was enough. The crew was very attentive and friendly. The food was good especially the icecream the served half way the flight. On the return I flew with a 777-200. It was on old plane but the seats were more spacious. The screen for the IFE was bad smaal and you couldn't see much on te screen in some positions. The crew was friendly again and there was good food. What I also liked is that the crew offering you plenty of drinks and after dinner they offer you liquor. Nice touch I didn't saw it on other airlines I flew with. We departed and arrived on time. So overall a good experience. I would definitely choose KLM again if the price is right. It's not very special but it's good and they have a nice crew. The only thing is that they have to renew their fleet. The 777-200 feels quite outdated.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Taipei to Amsterdam. I am quite familiar with that flight and I already know the defects (old air plane etc.) but I chose it nonetheless because of the convenient schedule. On my last trip the impression is that the company was saving money on every aspect. The food was shameful. The main dinner dish was pieces of chicken in a brown sauce with some peanuts in it. The breakfast made even less sense - the main food was one square omelette with one bacon slice served with two pieces of cheese and one stale croissant. The inflight entertainment / control did not work and this meant no reading light throughout the whole trip no possibility to call the cabin attendants (even to get a glass of water I had to jump over my neighbour). All this on top of the old airplane lack of privacy and an extremely uncomfortable sleeping position (as the seat is not horizontal every time you turn then you have to climb up the seat again). The ticket cost 5000EUR return I would not recommend it - a shame KLM fell so low.

KL1383 Amsterdam-Warschau (19/11) on Boeing 737-700. Wonderful flight as always! Nice crew tasty sandwiches a good selection of drinks (served twice!) and comfortable seats!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
KL1602 (FCO-AMS): I would describe the whole experience as efficient yet comfortable. As this is a short flight (2 hours) the crew managed to make the flight pleasant. The service was offered twice the first with sandwich with cheese and selection of drinks (hot beverages and soft drinks) and followed with tea and coffee with biscuits. Crew were nice and helpful for the full flight and noticed how they are really aware on recycling meal packaging after meal service was completed. Totally recommend KLM for the regional Europe flights as they have managed to make the flight comfortable and seamless.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Rio de Janeiro - London via Amsterdam B777-200. Overnight flight from Rio to London - lucky for me I got an empty seat next to me. The seat actually felt quite roomy for economy class seat pitch seemed generous. The exit row upgrade was absurdly priced at £120 (on a £490 flight) at time of booking - for comparison the first leg with Air France was £50 which I paid. KLM also offers 'economy comfort' which seems to be premium economy but at €180 to upgrade I ignored - you can check out on the seat map if you actually get more room but I looked closely on the way out of the plane and there is no discernible difference in pitch and still a 3x3x3 configuration. IFE was exceptionally poor on this flight - I'm not sure if 2014 has been a bad year for blockbusters but very little worth watching and each TV show only has one episode which is very annoying. Why would you only want to watch one episode is beyond me. Food was pretty decent though and the service attentive so overall a positive flight. Amsterdam Schipol a nice airport to transfer through as well.

Early Sunday morning flight on 9 Nov AMS to MAN on a KLM 737-800. Flight left a little late but the very short flight time made up for the delay. Arrival 10 minutes before scheduled arrival time. Professional and friendly crew. Service with a smile. Catering was nothing special tea and a cookie but nothing more was expected. Excellent value for money only 112 euro return. Actually much cheaper than so-called low cost carrier on this route. Return pretty much the same. Arriving just 5 minutes late in AMS due to the long taxiing after landing. Well recommended.

Flew JFK-JNB via AMS. Seats were uncomfortable close to no recline cabin was hot and the food was pretty poor. Heard a lot about Schipol airport but it turned out to be a cross of La Guardia and Frankfurt. I don't recommend KLM if the flight is over 7 hours long.

Flew from Toronto - Amsterdam and return. The first flight was one of the last for the MD11. The return was 747. The seats on the 747 were excellent. The upper deck was like a private room. Staff were first rate. The captain came and introduced himself as did the chief purser. Staff were attentive and often anticipated requests. The meal out of Toronto was fair at best but it always is. Out of Amsterdam it was very good. The sole was one of the best meals I have had on an aircraft in years. My only negative is the departure gate in Schiphol. Security is cleared at the gate. This meant the flight was called an hour and a half before departure. All the passengers were squeezed sardine lik in the tiny waiting area. There was not enough seating. Wheelchairs had to push through with the result that people were stepping on each other. I mentioned this to the KLM attendant at the gate. She told me to write the management. Bottom line avoid Schipol for departures.

Flew KUL-CGK and return - travelling with a 2 year old toddler. Crew were generally attentive. The crew who served our aisle on the return flight was exceptionally pleasant to our little girl. Meals were appropriate for a 2-hour flight and and suited time of the day however no options were offered.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
First off the plane was clean and the crew were smiling friendly and very helpful. Every time someone called an attendant you could see several of them jump to attention and immediately attend to the passengers needs. The food was pretty good. My partner got the Dutch style meal and it was always delicious and I kept getting the Asian meal which was just ok. The website said that economy would get an amenity bag but these were missing from our flights so we didn't have an eye mask and toothbrush as we thought they would be provided but they were not. The seats were awful. My partner and I are not big or tall and we are usually quite comfortable in standard economy seats but these were horrible. My knees were touching the seat in front of me and there was a box under the seat in front of me so I couldn't put my feet anywhere. At mealtimes it was difficult to eat because we had to keep our elbows in to keep from elbowing our neighboring passengers. By the end of our going flight we had decided pay for the exit row seats for the return flight (AMS-NRT return). I don't get it because this is not a budget airline but the seats were so tight. There were cheaper airlines flying to Tokyo but we chose this one thinking it would be more comfortable. We have flown KLM for intercontinental flights and they are good but the long haul flights we probably won't do again and opt for a more comfortable airline.

Manchester-Manila return 03/10/14 and returned 19/10/14. Flights delayed after stop over in Taiwan going to Manila and from Taiwan going back to Amsterdam. Had to disembark twice in Taiwan as transit passengers. Air conditioning system not working properly on the ground going back to Amsterdam. So hot and inconvenient with no proper updated announcement as to what's going on. Very cheap and inconvenient earphones. Very limited inflight entertainment choices. No inflight menu selection food so so and the cabin crews just shove the trays in front of you - not very hospitable. Poor handling of ground staff about transfer and connecting flights due to delays. Messy chaotic and tiring flights. First time to fly KLM and the experience puts me off using their service again. Overall experience not enjoyable and won't recommend it. Needs improvement.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
KLM are generally a safe choice. Their economy short haul service is up there with the best. Free sandwich alcoholic drink coffee and biscuit. Flights are always on time and staff are professional. If I pulled them up the first point would be on the use of the Fokker F70s this is 1996 technology and long overdue for replacement with with Embraer's or Bombadier's latest product. If you sit next to the emergency exit you can practically hear the air leaking. Secondly their prices can vary for no reason at all. Would choose again if price works.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Delayed flights. Poor air conditioning system. Poor communication with passengers regarding delays. So-so food no inflight menu selection. Very poor and cheap earphones.

Overall rating: Poor needs improvement. Not a very good first time experience flying with KLM. Not good value for money and I would not definitely recommend it.

Having booked a series of long-haul Business Class flights with KLM I searched their website and their Terms and Conditions just to make sure that in line with all other airlines they allow the inflight use of CPAP machines (CPAP = Continuous Positive Airway Pressure - a small air pump that prevents sleep apnoea). As they provide power sockets to their long-haul Business Class seats I assumed that this would be no problem but believe it or not KLM will not allow passengers to connect medical equipment to their power sockets! KLM allow passengers to connect anything else to their power sockets (computers tablets DVD players phone chargers electric razors etc) but not medical equipment. I have told KLM that my little CPAP machine is electrically tested and internationally certified for aircraft use - but still they say no. When asked why they refuse to answer. What a disgraceful disgusting policy and what an arrogant attitude!

Flight from Helsinki to Amsterdam this morning has so far been a joke. For check in and boarding they had 2 clerks and 1 priority lane for a full flight. Even if queue was extremely long (schools autumn break) no additional measures were taken and queue time was an hour. When the given boarding time was close two clerks left even if there was still a queue. Now we are about to take off (delayed) as a drunk passenger had to be removed let's see what's next.

I flew KL876 9 Oct BKK-AMS and KL875 AMS-BKK. I was delighted to see that KL has retained its Dutch identity and good service. I flew in Economy Comfort outbound economy to BKK. Leg room was good in economy and of course better in Comfort. Two hot meals served in each direction. Meals were good quality. Fresh and tasty. Free wind and beer offered during the flight. KL allows small personal electronics from gate to gate (in airplane mode) so I enjoyed reading from my Kindle as I liked. Crews and ground staff were friendly and helpful. KLM is a professional airline that is putting US carriers to shame!

First time flying KLM for a long haul flight from Geneva-Amsterdam-Jakarta (via Kuala Lumpur) vv. Had a ticketing issue in Geneva but ground staff handled it. Both flights boarded on time however my flight from Amsterdam to Jakarta was delayed 30 minutes. Arrived on time in Jakarta. My flight back from Jakarta also had some issues first the ticketing (again) and also the baggage handling as I have Elite Status on Skyteam I was supposed to get 10 kg extra however I needed to pay 100USD for my 5 kg extra. The food was tasty cabin crew did what they should although they were not willing to fill my bottle of water on my flight from Jakarta to Amsterdam. the entertainment was good. The seats were uncomfortable especially on their 777-300ER (very narrow and not enough legroom for me 178cm tall).

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-NBO Left on time KLM is not the best of airlines although it still would like to consider itself one of them. Their tickets are overpriced compared to the comfort you get with Middle East carriers. The food is poor. The economy class menu is never changed - you eat the same food over and over again. The food is way below the standard of some other 4 and 5 star airlines. Same goes for the inflight entertainment. Not many new movies lot's of old stuff. And the screens and remote controls are old small and cumbersome. However the crew was as always most helpful and friendly and gave me the feeling of being valued as a frequent flyer and most importantly they got the job done on time. They get you from A to B without any / much delays which these days is more of an exception than standard at most airlines. I live in Amsterdam which is KLM's homebase if I lived somewhere else I would not fly KLM this much.

DFW-AMS-VIE on Aug 25 DFW-AMS on an old Airbus 330-200 AMS-VIE on a 737-700 both legs in World Business Class / Business Europe. DFW-AMS was on-time FA's were very attentive and friendly addressing passengers by name and in at least 4 different languages based on the passengers nationality brilliant crew! WBC seats on the old Airbus 330-200 were tired angle-flats which although comfortable for resting were not comfortable enough for a decent sleep which I consider the most important requirement for a night flight in Business Class. Configuration was old style 2-2-2. IFE was AVOD but screens were again low quality and system has seen better time; e.g. only the third pair of headphones I received actually worked. Meals served were Cajun Tuna and Chicken Tikka Masala (or Steak or Cannelloni) for dinner and Blueberry Pancakes (or Feta Omelette) for breakfast. Food served was ok catering on the flight out of KLMs home base Amsterdam on the way to the US was far superior to the offerings on this flight back. Wine list again nice with some interesting choices out of the box. AMS-VIE was fine and on-time with nothing special to report seats were economy seats with the middle seat left vacant KLM uses a rented lounge facility in DFW which was OK with a good selection of drinks and limited food offerings definitely better than the typical lounges run by the US airlines. KLMs Schengen lounge in AMS was again comfortable again with a decent drink selection and limited food offerings. Transfer in AMS meant walking long distances but was eventless otherwise. Transfer immigration and security control involved considerable less waiting time than I remember from previous instances. I have flown with AA BA AY IB and LX on transatlantic routes over the past years and all featured more modern planes with better business class seating. KLM needs to retire or update these old planes to offer a really competitive transatlantic product. So except for the seating a good flight but due to the old seats far from perfect product for a night flight. Recommended if available at a very competitive price.

We flew from Amsterdam to Quito and Panama to Amsterdam in economy on B777. Both flights were a few minutes late departing. Food was average and the entertainment system was quite good. Seat comfort was about average. However there was one area where the airline excelled and that was the friendliness and helpfulness of the the cabin crew. We have used Iberia before for flights to Latin America and I have to say KLM was much better. The generally surly crews on Iberia could learn a thing or two about customer service!

KL1699 AMS-MAD (23/9) and KL1706 MAD-AMS (03/10). Both flights on Boeing 737-800. Self-service bag drop was as always problematic. My bag was refused 4 times. I really hate the self-service bag drop off units and will try to avoid them next time. Luckily there is always a standard manned bag drop unit available. One of the main reasons that I prefer flying KLM is the 'welcome feeling' you get when you enter the plane. On both flights the crew was very friendly and attentive. Several drinks two sandwiches and a cookie were served on both flights. Inflight entertainment could be better. I missed a personal or central AVOD to follow the course of the flight.

Whenever possible I will fly KLM - Schiphol was also a very user friendly airport.

VIE-AMS-DFW on Aug 8 VIE-AMS on a 737-700 AMS-DFW on an old Airbus 330-200 both legs in Business Europe / World Business Class – VIE-AMS was on time FAs were friendly and attentive continental breakfast served was decent although not stellar as with most flight in Europe seats were economy seats with the middle seat left vacant. – AMS-DFW on-time on a tired but clean Airbus 330-200 with vintage 2-2-2 configuration. IFE was AVOD but screens were from previous century and picture quality poor selection was OK. WBC seats were just angle-flat and rather tired but comfortable for resting on a day flight. FAs were brilliant attentive and doing their job with a smile. Food served was quite good. Salmon Tartare and Indonesian Chicken Curry (or 2 other choices of Beef or Plaice) for lunch. Chili Prawns and Indonesian Beef (or Cod) for the second meal. It was nice that the product featured some Dutch (Indonesian) elements throughout the flight and was not just generic. Wines served were also nice with some interesting choices not just the standard fare. KL uses a shared airport lounge in VIE which is not particularly great but in line with other lounges in VIE and at least not overcrowded. KL’s Non-Schengen lounge in AMS was nice and spacious with a decent selection of drinks but with limited food choices. Transfer in AMS involved walking long distances but was otherwise hassle free. Overall I found KL to offer a good product for a day flight thanks to the soft product on board and the flights' on-time performance. Recommended for a day flight in spite of the old planes used on this particular transatlantic route.

My wife and I flew with KLM from London to Amsterdam and then on to Aruba in September. Our outgoing flights were outstanding. Good food good entertainment and good staff we could not be more pleased. However our return flight was the opposite food was extremely poor seen very little of the staff but the entertainment was ok. I fail to understand how an airline can achieve the two extremes in a very short space of time. KLM showed us that the airline has the potential to be outstanding but appears to have continuity issues.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I have flown KLM on hundreds of flights. KLM is great in a lot of ways - clean responsive and a friendly staff. However they seem to really dislike Delta Sky Miles members. I have been a SkyTeam Diamond Member due to travel for more than four years straight. It never fails. KLM will guarantee great seats for its direct ticket passengers but it will ALWAYS shove the Delta passengers into middle rows/seats no matter what. You might get lucky on occasion. But typically KLM will not support its partner airline programs. I did not have similar experiences with Kenya Air or Air France. KLM seems to be the only member of the team that acts this way.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
We took KLM from LAX to Amsterdam in September 2014 we booked two seats together with "extra legroom" (an extra $180) and arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before the flight to check-in. When we checked in we were told that our seats had been sold. The ground crew made no effort to apologize nor offer an alternative solution. Ultimately we were seated in the back of the plane adjacent to the restrooms terrible seats. I think this is called a "bait and switch" on our return flight they did same thing to couple behind us.

Flight from Toronto to Amsterdam was delayed (4 hours). The $20 voucher that was given for the delayed was invalid throughout the airport and KLM staff was rude and refused an explanation when asked. Flight from Amsterdam to Toronto was once again delayed and the entertainment screen in approximately half of the seats (including mine) did not work. Not a good experience and will not travel again with KLM.

Sao Paulo - Amsterdam - London and back. Their website was very efficient and online check-in worked fine. Picked up the boarding pass at the airport via self service machine without any trouble. Boarding was efficient and quick. Plane (B777-300ER) left on time. I am not that big but leg (and knee) space was more than enough (considering it was economy). Enjoyed the IFE although I do believe the movie selection could have been better (however it changes monthly). Food was good and I must state that the fact that KLM constantly replaces the snacks on the back of the plane is very good: If you are ever thirsty or hungry you can always find a constantly renewed set of snacks and drinks at the back. I had a good short haul experience (B737-800). Leg space good and nice crew. Nice snacks were served there as well. I had the same experience on return and I must say that I considered KLM a great airline.

CAI-AMS-EDI. LON-AMS-CAI: The flight from CAI to AMS was ok and comfortable that is due to an empty flight so I could take a row of 3 seats to stretch out the food was good and basic service was very good. Arrived to AMS on time but for no obvious reason the jetway to disembark the plane was not working! So they made us go down the plane by stairs and then climb side stairs again of that broken jetway to get into the terminal. It was very tiring especially with your carry on's. 2.5 hrs connecting time at Schipol then flew KL again to Edinburgh B737-400 nice and new aircraft snack was fine and service was very good. LON-AMS was in that Small Fokker 70 it is really a very small plane thank goodness the flight was really short AMS-CAI the boarding was chaotic security was endless the flight was full and the seating was really very narrow and annoying. Food was ok and entertainment was fine.

IAH-AMS-SVO. Departure from IAH on time and early arrival to AMS. Flew in Economy Comfort but without comfort as seats are the same as without the "comfort" attribute except they have 2" of extra legroom. Service onboard decent and staff friendly as long as you do not ask for another something. AMS-SVO on B737-800 with seat configuration that charter airlines use. Practically no legroom at all. STW very rude when I asked her to move rows and although boarding was over she insisted that I could not move in order not to disturb the weight balance of the aircraft! I am a FF with a gold elite status and such answer left me shocked. Overall except comfort onboard KLM is ok.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Traveled in July and Aug From Amsterdam to Arusha and back. I had heard KLM consistently had less than stellar reviews and they lived up to their reputation. Their food customer service and cabin quality paled in comparison to Delta who handled the second leg of the trip. If There was another option I would not travel KLM again but I expect that is why the get away with what they do.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Amsterdam-Lima 777-300ER. 10 abreast seating in the 300 made for a very cramped experience especially in the middle. This coupled with the outdated infotainment the plane being totally full and ridiculously tough 'calzone' and the odd decision to freeze the passengers with the air conditioning midway through the flight made the 12.5 hour journey uncomfortable.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
KLM trying to become the airline with the worse pr as no respect or appreciation for fq travelers. Two days ago BRU-AMS-TLV all well until now. When arriving in lounge at AMS airport I discovered we would not fly non-stop to TLV as booked and paid for. We had to endure a one hour stop in Larnaca for no valid reason whatsoever as a very late arrival in TLV. No compensation no refund no re-routing. I am a platinum for life member of AF/KLM (skyteam) I will not fly KLM anymore.

KLM has the best e-checkin service that I've seen. They make getting to your flight an efficient and easy process. And although this Amsterdam to Barcelona flight on an 737-800 is only 100min in duration they served wonderfully packaged fresh food and drinks.

KL1774 FRA-AMS 16/8/2014 on Embraer 190. Efficient online check-in and friendly staff at baggage drop off. The seat comfort was remarkable (seat 4A) comfortable leather seats and more than enough space. The flight had a delay of 30 minutes due to late arrival of the plane. Many passengers were afraid to miss their connection but the co-pilot and crew informed them well. Flight attendants were not as friendly as they use to be (both flight attendants were British and not Dutch). One drink and a snack was served.

KL1927 AMS-GVA 23/7/2014 on Boeing 737-800. Efficient online check-in and very friendly staff at baggage drop off. The flight had a delay of 20 minutes due to the busy summer holiday schedule at Schiphol Airport but the co- pilot kept us well informed. Flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. Two drinks and chips were served.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
My experience with KLM on my roundtrip AMS-YUL-AMS was absolutely positive. The staff (ground and crew) was very friendly helpful and inviting. The meals were of good quality and more than I expected. At almost any given time of the flight a member of the cabin crew was present in the cabin. Announcements from the cockpit informed us in time about possible delay due to heavy traffic in AMS. My economy seat was quite comfortable. I really enjoyed the flight and definitely recommend the travel product KLM offers.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Having heard about KLM's new business class product being fitted on KLM's 777 fleet from April I was hopeful to experience it on my trip to Lima (after all why on earth did it take them so long to introduce proper flatbeds in the first place). No such luck the cabin crew told me the roll-out on the 777's won't now start till October. The old business class seats in a 2-3-2 configuration simply isn't what you expect on a premium airline. Also due to staff shortages there wasn't a fast-track channel opened up on boarding. The crew were excellent and to some extent made up for the lack in comfort and sophistication of the product but until the fleet is properly kitted out I'll avoid KLM for long haul flights.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew from Bristol to Amsterdam then back again in August 2014. Have done the same journey twice with EasyJet and Ryanair in the last year. KLM was a big improvement! Competitive prices great service friendly staff pleasant flights free snack and beverage on board. It's a shame to read some of the bad reviews on here and I can only assume they are few and far between as my experience with KLM was magnificent. Highly recommended will be flying with them again for sure!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
After a beautiful week in St. Petersburg and Moscow it was time to fly back with the KLM from Moscow (SVO) to Amsterdam (AMS). The Moscow airport (SVO) is in fact a very dull airport. Some shops and restaurants in the middle and that’s about it. Our flight (PH-BXP 737-900) arrived on time and we started boarding approx half an hour before scheduled departure. We already checked in the day before and were offered an economy comfort seat for a small extra price. I took seat 5c since I prefer to always sit on the aisle. We took off about 15 minutes after scheduled departure and soon after we reached cruising altitude a hot meal was offered in economy. I was pleasantly surprised by this service since on the way in to St. Petersburg only a hot snack was offered. Finally a cup of tea or coffee was served. Arrival was on time and soon after I found myself waiting for the train to take me home.

Flew Bristol to Lima business class. No delays on either journey. Seats were comfortable able to catch a few hours sleep on the overnight flight on the way back. The entertainment system was good the cabin crew very attentive. Travelling to and from Bristol went without a hitch despite a tight connection on the way back.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
First time to fly KLM based on their new World Business Class Product. We flew return from Toronto to Amsterdam. Both flights on time service outstanding although slightly higher marks to the crew on the outbound. The new WBC seat was the most comfortable ever flown in and unlike other airline layouts the main cabin (747) was extremely spacious. Even the upper deck was well laid out. Will be using them again on our next flight and would recommend their new World Business Class on the 747's only at the moment.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I have taken 4 international flights in the last week with KLM. One was canceled-I was given the offer to take a partner flight so went to the airport but all seats had been taken-went home and took the next day flight. On arriving in Amsterdam for a connecting flight to London there was over a 3 hour delay - finally got on the plane to London and there wasn't any running water in the lavatory! I am just back in Japan minus my checked-in bags! I do not know if this is the norm with KLM but it has been a nightmare as 3 out of 4 flights I have taken have had problems. I have an exceedingly bad taste in my mouth-my 12 year old son too.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Dreadful experience. 28th July. 3 hours on the Tarmac at Glasgow because Schiphol airport was closed due to weather conditions. Yet they still flew us into the chaos knowing that we had missed our connecting flight and that all flights out of Amsterdam were cancelled or delayed. Long story cut short 200000 cases lying in the hold in Amsterdam KLM staff rude and not enough of them to deal with the amount of people requiring flights. Stood for 8 hours in queues along with hundreds of others with only a bottle of water given to us free of charge they told us to find our own hotel rooms for the night and they would refund the cost first night of our holiday lost luggage then lost for 4 days! Holiday to Lake Como completely ruined. No customer service whatsoever! £25 voucher given to us with our lost luggage for our next flight with KLM- no thanks KLM we will use other airlines. Never again will we fly through Schiphol or use KLM.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
LHR-AMS-DXB in business class. By far the best part of the flight was the Skyteam lounge at H/row T4 Amsterdam's lounge was tired unwelcoming huge queue to enter and poor selection of refreshments. Schiphol is undergoing a major refit avoid until completed! Very old aircraft with equally tired crew who did the minimum to service a full flight. I can only imagine that the KLM cabin crew are on fantastic salaries otherwise why would they want to be there? It certainly had nothing to do with wanting to provide any level of service. Food average frequent beverage service and on schedule arrival. As a FB Platinum for life member I have tried to remain loyal although with so many airlines flying into the ME region now I will certainly shop around. What's the point of being loyal if there is absolutely zero interest from KLM when giving them your business?

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Amsterdam to LHR - travelled on KLM after 14 years and now I wish that I hadn't. As a very frequent flyer KLM staff are some of the most unfriendly I have come across. The only positive experience of the whole journey was the check in/baggage drop. I personally believe that as consumers we have other better options than KLM to choose from.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
We flew direct from Amsterdam to Calgary on July 18th 2014 in economy class and had a great flight. We had a very pleasant male flight attendant who was excellent. It was our first KLM flight and we were very pleased with everything from superior service to piping hot food movie selection timely arrival and the comfy pillow and blanket provided. We highly recommend them. The plane was full but the service and pleasantness of staff was still great even though they were kept very busy.

Return flight from Thailand to Bristol UK via Amsterdam outward journey went as smooth as silk checked in online arrived early and dropped my baggage - took about 30 seconds. Everything ok with boarding tiny uncomfortable seat. I had already booked a comfort seat for return very glad that I did. Amsterdam was a good transfer arrived at Bristol with no problems. The return was horrible first of all checking in online for Bristol was a waste of time check-in opened late and no baggage drop. Informed that I was 3 kilos overweight and must pay £79. Onboard staff and food were excellent. Probably the first and last time with KLM.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Just flew R/T from IAD-AMS-Dammam Saudi Aradia. I have not been on KLM international for years and based on European flights I had taken I was not expecting much. They had exceptional fares to Middle East so I tried them out. I was really very pleasantly surprised. Outstanding service on all 4 legs of the journey. Staff very attentive with the purser speaking to every business class passenger. Food about average for an international airline. Planes were A330's seats much like Qatar Airways I rarely lay flat but it looked like others were able to. Amsterdam is a very good transit airport and the KLM lounge is very good thought it does not have a great variety of foods (what it has is good). Best part of the lounge for me was the "deep rest" room with chaise lounges in carrells in a very dark room with just enough light to get around. My other European favourite airline is BA and I give KLM the edge with the more people-friendly airport. Too bad for me they're not in the OneWorld Alliance.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Booked flights from Abu Dhabi to Glasgow on three separate dates in July for family of four. Experienced problems with each flight on the 8th daughter missed connection to Glasgow due to flight delay from Abu Dhabi as a result spent 6 hours in Amsterdam airport and as compensation was given €10! On the 17th luggage failed to make the connection again due to flight delay and today the 25th my wife failed to make the connection again due to flight delay and was sent via Birmingham to Glasgow on the last FlyBe flight (further delayed by one hour) resulting in a total travel time of over 17 hours. The luggage was received the next afternoon however KLM could not advise delivery time therefore day wasted waiting in hotel room. KLM support found to be very poor particularly the Dubai call center and on line check in facilities. Why offer flights when the connection cannot be made?

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-SFO. Was keen to take this flight because of the unusual schedule leaves AMS at 09.50 not uncivilised but with a ten hour flight time and an eight hour time difference it lands in SFO at 11.45. Wake up in Europe and be on the Pacific coast before noon! I tracked the punctuality of the flight in the two days before my own and it was five hours late and four hours late respectively so I should have been relieved that we were taxiing only one hour late although my dream of a morning arrival in California was dashed. The reason given was late arrival of the inbound aircraft but with all the flight tracking apps these days airlines are going to have to be more creative with their excuses - our aircraft had arrived from Paramaribo hours earlier and on schedule. New business class seat on KLM is pretty good note that only window seats have a little shelf next to the headrest so I had room for books iPod et al but not sure what aisle pax are supposed to do with their stuff. Food was excellent was sorry they didn't have a spare as I would have eaten it up despite being quite full. Only downside was the crew were not very friendly overall and one in particular was extremely unhappy to be there a lot of hostility on show which is inappropriate given what biz class pax have paid. Landed half an hour late still one of the first international arrivals of the day so immigration took only a couple of minutes and bags were delivered promptly. I would take this flight again but hope for a happier crew next time.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
My recent (July 2014) flight from Johannesburg to Amsterdam on KLM was one of the worst flights. I had a terribly uncomfortable seat (15A) in what KLM ironically calls economy comfort class and for which it even charges a premium economy price. The slightly friendly cabin crew were among the least competent cabin staff I have ever seen on a flight. There were people still standing when the flight took off and no crew to be found. The crew tells passengers to close the overhead bins and finally the crew left the cabin lights on for several hours into into the flight and probably would have left them on the whole flight if I had not asked them to turn them off. The cramped seat made sleeping impossible the food was average to poor and served without salt pepper or utensils which I had to request separately. Departure was delayed the arrival late (although not too late) and nobody was on hand to provide connecting flight information. Definitely to be avoided.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Years since I last flew with KLM. Just a short trip from Manchester to Amsterdam and back. We booked "Economy Comfort" which gave an additional 4" of legroom. Pleasant flight each way. just time for a snack of either a bag of "chips" (crisps) or a cookie and a quick drink before we were preparing to land. Delay on landing because a vehicle has broken down at the gate and delay of 30 minutes coming back due to late arrival of the plane otherwise all OK as far as the airline experience was concerned. Staff on board were excellent and tried their best to accommodate everyone's needs. Very full flights each way.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
KL0888 - I flew from Hong Kong to Amsterdam on the B747-Combi. It was a really pleasant flight. Boarding and check-in was easily done and the seat itself was comfortable although a bit hard for the back which made it a hard to sleep. The recline was really good and made the flight really comfortable and the legroom was great as I could stretch out fully (I'm 5"8). The meals were delicious a lot better than the meals served on other long haul flights. The entertainment was excellent and included a wide range of new movies and it had videos about KLM and what it does to help our world and it surely was impressive. The cabin crew were really friendly and had a smile on their faces which made the flight more pleasant. All in all the Economy Comfort cabin was located in between Business and Economy class cabins and was isolated from both of the cabins which gave a really private feel which was great. I will definitely fly KLM again!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
KLM 1845 from Amsterdam to Vienna on of July. We had booked the flight over a month before the flight departure date. Upon online check-in one of us was at the front of the plane and the other at the very rear. We had to ring up customer support as the online check in gave no other seating options and asked to change this so that we could sit together. We were told the only seats next to each other had the aisle in between. We were also told if we got to the airport early the check-in staff should change this so we could sit in the same row together. We arrived at airport check-in more than 3 hours early but we were told the airplane was full and there was no way to get around this. We were also told that we had to pay 30 Euro to check in our baggage since we had not done it online (but we couldn't do it online or else we wouldn't have been able to change our seats at the airport!). We discussed our experience with the lady at the check-in desk and she told us if we used one of the computers located on the other side of the airport we would be able to check our luggage in for free. So we went and found an internet kiosk checked in and still had to pay 15 Euro per suitcase. We then went back to the check in desk paid an extra 20 Euro each to sit in an 'Economy Comfort' seat because we were told there was simply nothing else that could be done. Long story short: this two hour flight cost us $900 AUD up front to be seated nowhere near each other. When we tried to alter this so we could sit next to each other it cost us an extra $120 AUD. Would never ever fly again nor recommend to anybody else.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I would definitely recommend KLM. Recently flew KRS-AMS-CDG. All flights were really comfortable due to KLM's big legroom (so that tall Dutch people can have a decent flight). Staff were polite and efficient. Flights were always on time.

Flew from KUL-AMS and return AMS-KUL. Flight to Amsterdam was on a 777-200 and flight to Kuala Lumpur was on a 777-300. The flights were excellent with a cheery and efficient cabin crew. In-flight entertainment on the 777-200 was mediocre - although sleeping had a higher priority than checking all the movies and series. Flight to Kuala Lumpur unfortunately was overbooked but luckily KLM managed to get us a seat. All in all flights were very comfortable perfectly on-time and yes I would choose them again.

LAX-AMS. Flight 602. Boarding was quick. Onboard they offered free newspapers pillows blankets earphones good entertainment system alcohol and 2 meals - dinner and breakfast. The crew offered good service but definitely nothing special. Legroom was typical for the airline and the aircraft type but I wouldn't mind just a bit more space. The highlight of the trip was punctuality. We were on time when flew to LA. We arrived earlier when we flew back to Amsterdam. Bags travelled safe. I would recommend KLM on long-haul flights.

NBO-AMS-NCL. Slightly disappointing flight from Nairobi - cramped narrow seats on B747 and in-flight entertainment completely broken (although KLM very quick to credit 6000 miles to Flying Blue account by way of apology). Difficult to sleep due to lack of legroom. Food pretty good and cabin crew friendly and efficient. Not a bad flight just poor in comparison to Kenya Airways who codeshare on the same route. Short hop from AMS-NCL efficient and easy as ever. I would stick with Kenya Airways for this route in the future.

Flight #603 (Delta #9298) 16 June 2014 Amsterdam to Los Angeles.Once aboard the airplane the trip was a very pleasant and enjoyable experience. The upper cabin of this Boeing 747 was spacious and very comfortable. The stewardesses directed us to our seats and helped stow our carry-on luggage. The meals and beverage service were delicious and generous. The fully reclining seats were the most comfortable of any airline we traveled. Throughout the trip the cabin staff showed they were interested in helping us and making us comfortable. The take-off and landing were very smooth and on-time. Our checked baggage arrived in good shape. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is a real "jewel".

GLA-AMS-DEL. The connecting flight to Amsterdam departed on time and arrived early. The catering on this admittedly short flight is poor. I expect more than 1 biscuit on a full fare airline! The flight to Delhi on an Airbus A320 left punctually. The service was friendly and the economy class food was actually quite good. Arrived 30 minutes early. The return flight was delayed 2 hours due to technical problems at Amsterdam. A replacement aircraft had to be found. Communication from KLM was excellent.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
FRA-AMS-LAX on E190 and then 744. Check-in in FRA was quick AF Lounge good. Easy Transfer in AMS but a long wait at a crowded gate before boarding due to plane change and more security checks (which is good). Seat 1A in front of Business class cabin probably the best Business class seat in the western hemisphere. Crew was amazing IFE broke down several times but after a good 2hours ok with average selection. Only real downside is the food instead of trying fancy things I suggest a better mainstream selection. With a 34seat Business class only SQ like service should be no issue with little extra investment. Wine and Drinks selection was ok with regular refill.

Inflight entertainment was excellent great choice of Dutch and international movies. Again a very positive experience with KLM.

UIO-AMS-GVA-AMS-UIO. UIO check-in and boarding were excellent but amazed me only two ground agents were using KL uniforms the rest were with common clothing helping passengers. Flight to GYE a beverage service was provided buy service excellent. At GYE boarding was also excellent and flight to AMS: excellent on board service from flight attendants dinner and breakfast provided with good food as tasty as this can be on an airplane free spirits served with dinner inflight entertainment excellent. At AMS to GVA boarding was excellent snack provided also excellent service from flight attendants. GVA check in was good not as excellent as at other flights but no boarding pass was provided for connecting flight as check-in agent told me she was unable to issue it. GVA boarding was good but not as in previous flights many people boarded when they should not. Good breakfast provided on flight to AMS and excellent service from flight attendants. Arriving at AMS only machine check-in was possible to obtain boarding pass not issued for connecting flight but pre-reserved seat one month in advance was not honored instead an aisle was provided; as a claustrophobic I always need a window seat but agents at AMS gate told me there was not a possibility to give my pre-reserved seat neither another window seat and only a not sincere "I'm sorry" was provided. Flight to UIO was very good flight attendants service excellent a good meal and refreshment were served free spirits given with lunch inflight entertainment was excellent and for all flights seats were good. Unluckily the aisle seat gave me a not so pleasant flight for reasons explained before this makes me question why the possibility of pre-reserved seats are open when they don't honor them? Not good customer service in this aspect. Thinking if recommending KL to others.

Flew NCL-AMS-FUK-HND with my wife and 11 month old baby then returned NRT-AMS-NCL alone. The service regarding my infant son was fantastic. He was presented with a very cute bib and given a bassinet to sleep in. The stewards also provided baby food for him and hot water so we could make up our own things for him to eat. Also they were quite happy for us to spread a blanket on the floor near the exit for him to play on. It's the third time we've used KLM with our son the second long haul trip we've made with them - and they've been wonderful and friendly every time. No hitches everything smooth and on time and an excellent price!

October 2013 I flew KLM to the UK from Vancouver Island. I was very impressed with this airline. I had tricky connections coming from the Island on the Pacific to Leeds returning from Heathrow. The service was amazing food was tasty wine great. The only criticism had nothing to do with the airline. The Schiphol airport had a weird system of going from a secure area to a non-secure area only to be frisked again to get into a different secure area. I was going to buy a bottle of duty-free whiskey for a relative but was advised that I was risking it being confiscated as I passed through multiple screens.

LBA-AMS-SFO/IAD-AMS-LBA. Flew with KLM as part of our honeymoon in the USA. Both Cityhopper flights were excellent – no hassle quick decent snack and good attendants. Transfer going out was a bit tight but comfortable with a brisk walk and knowing your way through Schiphol. Boeing 747 to SFO was a little dated the IFE in my seat didn't work due to a broken audio input socket (not ideal on an 11 hour flight!). Luckily the gentleman on the aisle agreed to move to the only remaining seat on the plane had this not happened I think I would have lost my mind with boredom. Flight attendants were great - brought us a couple of glasses of champagne from Business Class for our honeymoon which was a nice touch. The journey back from Dulles was a different experience. Modern 330 again good selection of IFE. Cabin crew weren't particularly friendly - gave the impression of doing the bare minimum didn't want to ask for anything extra. Food was also a lot better going out than on return Our transfer at Amsterdam was scheduled to be 50 minutes between flights however with our first flight being 10 mins late and with taxiing etc we only made our flight to Leeds by 4 minutes with a sprint through Schiphol. There was no help in the terminal available or information to help us get there and the KLM staff at the gate made us to feel it was our fault we nearly missed the connection. The luggage wasn't so lucky – no apology was given but they did arrive at our home in Leeds later that day. I would only use KLM again if they were the most competitive - a very mixed experience and the transfer issues at Schiphol have seriously put us off.

Terrible experience and we haven't even gotten to the airport yet. We had assigned seats. When I checked in online one of our seats was changed to the back of the plane. We paid for upgrade to Economy comfort in the front of the plane. KLM changed the seats - no explanation no effort to make the change. We are going to have a great time at the airport tomorrow.

VIE-AMS- SFO return. We booked (my Wife and me) a Delta Ticket all flights operated by KLM which provides an overall good trip experience. Everything very good on board! Friendly Staff acceptable seating good catering. But both directions long haul flights the seats reserved during booking process were not any more reserved during check in. On AMS SFO it was a minor issue because of availability and assignment of two other seats located together. On the return it was worse. Assignment was 15 rows between the seats. To solve the topic found out during internet checkin I wanted to use the customer service hotline during check in which was not available by phone despite of 20 minute Queuing at the phone. The other communication methods offered by KLM (facebook communicator were not accessible from my mobile device using for internet check in). I solved the problem afterwards by myself finding close seats and negotiating with other passengers. All checked luggage from VIE to SFO delayed for one day because of baggage transfer problems in AMS despite of on time arrival of the aircraft VIE-AMS.

We bought tickets to fly round trip to Amsterdam from Oslo. My husband inadvertently pressed the wrong day for return but immediately called them within 5 minutes. They changed the date but made us pay 270 euros for the change refusing to consider an honest mistake. We received an email saying our day was changed. On the day of return we arrive at the airport and after waiting in line for 30 minutes we were told that we don't have a booking. We had to then go to another line to purchase our ticket and had to pay the difference of 270 euros again. We were told at that counter that we don't have to pay for our luggage as we are Delta frequent flyers but the lady at the luggage drop off refused to listen and made us pay 30 euros but after paying it our bag was returned due to an error so we went to another full service counter with our baggage where we were told we shouldn't have to pay for luggage. So now we have to claim the 30 euros online. So frustrated and disappointed with KLM. The ground staff were trying be helpful but were disconnected from each other.

I flew from LA to Amsterdam. The service and entertainment was excellent. They had many options for movies and music! There was no need for me to ask the staff for anything since it was offered to me. The staff were friendly attentive and courteous. I had the best yoghurt I have had as well my favorite alcoholic drink. My economy class truly felt like premium economy or business class.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
KWI-DMM-AMS-MME Economy Comfort. I have worked in the Gulf for almost 3 years now and have only recently started flying with KLM. I generally use Saudia and have sometimes flown with Air France but I wish I'd decided to try KLM sooner. The caring and friendly service on board is great and the in-flight product is proving to be reliably good. Upgrading to Economy Comfort is definitely worthwhile. Seats 11D and 11G on the A330-200 to Kuwait and Dammam offer amazingly generous legroom. The catering service is the same as standard Economy but the options are interesting and have tasted appetizing. KLM also offers wine and beers once flights have departed Kuwaiti and Saudi airspace and these have been enjoyable. Movies on demand include current releases and the newer aircraft have decent sized seatback TV screens. There is no amenity pack - not even a simple pair of eyeshades and a toothbrush - on the overnight sector. This would make a nice difference when you are leaving the Gulf around midnight and landing at Schiphol at 6 in the morning. The in-flight management of services by the Purser was very polished and as previous reviewers have noted KLM seems to offer a solid choice. I took a connecting flight with KLM Cityhopper to Durham Tees Valley and the service was similarly friendly and professional on a Fokker 70 with two by three seating and the option of extra legroom. Bags were checked from Kuwait right through to Durham and the amenities at Schiphol whilst in transit were high quality. It is worth checking the schedule as some KLM Gulf destinations involve double hops and the order of these will vary from day to day. A flight from Dammam may stop at Kuwait before Amsterdam or call at Dammam en-route from Kuwait. If you board at the first call or leave at the second this will add a good ninety minutes to your journey whilst the aircraft is refuelled and cleaned. Passengers travelling onwards do not have to leave the plane and you can stretch your legs on board before additional passengers take their seats but travelling on the previous or the following day might remove the need for this inconvenience. Fares especially the least flexible economy fares have been very reasonable indeed in relation to the overall quality provided.

Had seat 10A which is the front row of the A330-300 which has a huge amount of legroom. Flight left and arrived on time. Food was quite good. Staff very friendly and one of the stewards was gorgeous. I would recommend KLM.

TLV-AMS-TLV in economy comfort flew in old but very clean 737-800 plenty of space in economy comfort and managed to sleep both ways quite well. Staff are always pleasant enough and a bit more professional than on most Middle Eastern carriers. The food was reasonable for airline food but definitely nothing special. The price was also quite good. KLM is an old solid European airline. Reliable even if a bit spartan. Would certainly use again if the price is right.

KL1010/1012 return LHR to AMS for short city break. Both flights on time despite being very busy and circling over LHR. Well thought out light 3 course meal (even a menu) newspapers offered by very friendly cabin crew (on return journey they even offered best wishes to a bridal couple). Apart from being a bit expensive this was a delightful experience. Economy on this route is also very good value and includes drink and snack biscuits. Prefer to use LGW or LCY but KLM made the trek to Heathrow worthwhile.

Apr 2014 KL809 KUL-JKT and KL810 JKT-KUL. Check in at KUL was hassle free as I was the first to arrive. For the 1.5 hrs flight only snacks were served which wasn't so filling. Wished they would have serve a more filling meal. Return flight the meal was nasi lemak which was too salty! I would recommend you choose a special meal so you get a better meal than others. Plus the air con on the aircraft wasn't that cold. They should turn down the air con temperature so everyone would be comfortable. Return flight was on 28 April 2014 (KL810).

March 2014: KL 672 and KL 671 - Montreal to AMS and back on the old MD11 in business. The seats are old and I am looking forward to October 2014 when the MD11 will be replaced. However service on this route is always good. Dedicated staff easy going and attentive.

KL0410 Almaty-AMS 25/4/2014 on an Airbus 330-200. Plane was the last in a series bought in 2010 and chairs (old business class) are similar to Air France. Not full-flat. Easy to sit in a trouble to lie down on/sleep in if not on the first row (more space no leg restrictions but still not flat). Service was good/food very nice. Flight was a little delayed. Entertainment was good with plenty of choice and reasonable LCD-screen. If only they would install decent chairs in these planes as well.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
FRA-AMS-BCN-AMS-FRA in March. All flights on time so transfer in Amsterdam was quite easy. Walkways at Schiphol airport can be very long beware of too short connection times. Short flights FRA-AMS uneventful but KLM provides a free drink and a snack. Flights to Barcelona were on 737. Seats were ok. Cabin staff food (excellent sandwich) and drinks (two drink rounds) were great. Only Entertainment was poor. I don't expect personal TV on European flights but a selection of free newspapers would be adequate.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-MAN April 2014. This was the last flight of an 8 flight holiday and was by far the worst of all. The flight was delayed because of the inefficient security checks at the gate which took nearly an hour and a half to clear the flight making the plane 30 mins late. Another flight was allocated the same gate going to Anatalya so confusion reigned throughout! Plane was cramped worse than a charter flight staff were surly and service was slow and we were still finishing our snack on final approach. When will short haul operators remove the tilt back buttons on short haul flights it just makes for extra discomfort on an already cramped seating.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew last night with KLM from Chicago to Amsterdam in business class. This was the old business class in a 747 must be one of the last planes they have not converted the crew said it would be done in 6 weeks and I feel pity for anyone who has to fly this plane in the next 6 weeks. KLM old business class product is the worst in the industry outdated and very uncomfortable seats. On top of this as they are phasing them out they apparently also do not keep up maintenance. My chair power and motor to recline we're not working. I am staying away from any flight where they have the old business class the value for money is not acceptable.

SIN-AMS-GVA. The plane from SIN-AMS had what appeared to be folded paper forced in the gaps between the plastic pieces overhead probably to prevent noisy squeaking. The seat was hard. The screen was small. The movies were not the latest. The FA's were okay.

KL 0612 April 20th. At check-in in Chicago: given a free upgrade to business class for the flight to Amsterdam Schiphol. When you really want all the luxury and attention choose business class from KLM. Great service lots of space with the abillity to take a fully horizontal sleeping position (I'm 6 ft 3). Good size LCD screen etc. We enjoyed this champagne-experience.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I have traveled YYZ-AMS-BOM through KLM for 5 times in last 8 years and the quality of service is deteriorating as time progresses. I was happy to get a good deal for my trip only to realise that now I can carry only one piece of baggage on international flight (Jet Airways still allows two pieces of luggage at same price). YYZ-AMS leg was the most uncomfortable one with hardly any legroom on Boeing 737. Once you fit yourself in the seat it is a mammoth task to pry yourself outside of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers. The seats themselves are pretty uncomfortable too. Thankfully YYZ-AMS leg lasts only 6 hours. I ordered Asian vegetarian meal - big mistake - tasteless food. Dessert contains only few pieces of fruit. The staff seemed ok - not courteous though. They seemed to be doing their duty but customer service is definitely not their focus. AMS-BOM leg was operated by Delta and hence space was not a constraint. Better service than KLM. Vegetarian food was still bad.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Was booked for a flight to Denmark on KLM. The initial leg was on Delta and I was worried about that part but I had to transfer in Amsterdam with only a 1 hour layover and almost didn't make it. Amsterdam airport is something of a mess - long long terminals and long long lines. The flight back was KLM all the way. We left Amsterdam 1/2 hr late but looked to be landing in LA on time. Then the pilots got waived off and had to go around again. Result? We were 1/2 hr late. Sat in the hot plane on the tarmac at both LAX and Amsterdam as they were having gate issues combined with AC issues. Probably won't fly them again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
JFK to AMS and then AMS to ATH. First the JFK flight: We flew on the lovely new Boeing 777-300ER on this extremely short transatlantic flight from New York to Amsterdam around 6 hours flight time. After boarding it felt very clean and new just as an airplane should be. After sitting down it was obvious the seats were incredibly small about 17.5" wide. Luckily I had an aisle seat allowing me to stretch out a little. The crew acted calm and professional and wanted to help anyone in any way possible. After takeoff I watched a quick film and then was presented with dinner. Just before they served us hot towels which was a nice touch. In my case I ordered the vegetarian pasta dish served with rolls. The flight attendant serving the food was very engaging and personable and wanted to know nearly anything about our trip. My fellow students who came on the trip were sure to ask him questions to which he responded politely. After dinner I settled down for a small nap and just about four hours later the cabin lights were turned back on in preparation for landing. A hot towel was once again given to us which helped us clean up for arrival. Upon landing the flight attendants gave a very polite goodbye and sent us on our way very quickly. Afterwards I was sure to thank the gracious flight attendant who had been so polite to which he wished me luck and great fun in my final destination. Then the flight from AMS-ATH: This flight was conducted on board a Boeing 737-800. The seats again were very similar in that they were small. I was stuck with a middle seat in this case but slept soundly. A sandwich was served which doesn't happen on flights domestically in the U.S which gave me a sense of that European spirit. After landing in Athens the flight attendants once again wished us goodbye. All in all this is one of my favorite airlines and I have not ever had a better flight attendant than the one on the flight from JFK. I look forward to my next flight on KLM!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
OSL-AMS-HAV. KLM is a really good reliable and above all friendly airline. A330-200 for AMS-HAV means much better seat-width than sister-airline Air France's 777-300 used on CDG-HAV a far more comfortable 2-4-2 seating than the 777`s 3-4-3 and of course only half the amount of passengers making arriving formalities in HAV much faster. Still the success-key is the cabin crew and the in-flight service standard. First pre lunch drinks with pringles then a hot towel followed by a good hot lunch (choice of main) and after collecting meal trays: coffee/tea with cognac/liqueur. Ice cream was offered with coffee (and/or drinks) mid-way + several offerings of water/coke/juice through flight and a hot towel again before a new hot snack/meal in good time before landing. All this offered by crew members who seem to enjoy their work. Who can ask for more in economy? (Have flown KLM several times on long hauls and this seems to be their standard service program in economy). Hopefully some day in the future KLM/AirFrance will lean totally on KLM`s service standards.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Overall an enjoyable experience. Flying BHX-AMS-IAD and cabin crew were delightful and attentive. Food was good and drinks were served regularly. Flying IAD-AMS-BHX was good and bad in some respects. Much more room to relax as the flight was only about 1/3 full but felt slightly neglected by crew and had to ask for refreshments rather than have them brought to me regularly (perhaps because it was a red eye flight? who knows). Crew also somewhat less enthusiastic on this return but not rude or unprofessional.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
My problem is that we paid 3 months in advance for premium economy seats but we did not get them. It is evident from our dealings with the airline that they can only provide about 20% of the seats they sell. Therefore they lull passengers like me into booking with them when we could in fact book a comfort seat with another more reliable airline. Offering me a refund is not acceptable in view of the fact I could have booked with someone else and had a much more pleasant trip.

Flew economy class on airbus 330-200 to Madrid from Vancouver. Both flights departed on time. The food was pretty good on both flights and staff was friendly and helpful.

Flew KUL-CGK-KUL recently on their B772 outbound and the B77W inbound. Both sectors were pleasant and KLM has a very distinct image and branding of the colour blue. Cabin crew were pleasant and friendly and the aircraft was impeccable. Departure on time and early arrival. Food was fantastic for a two hour flight. Entertainment or IFE was easy to use and useful for the short hop. I will find another excuse to fly with them again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew AMS-YUL and return on KLM on 14th and 21st February respectively. On the first leg our original plane developed a fault which resulted in a delay of 3 hours. However arrangements were swiftly made to bring in a replacement aircraft (even the same type MD-11 allowing us to keep our original seating assignments). Despite the delay the cabin crew were not grumpy in fact they were very friendly the seats were comfortable and the food delicious - KLM economy class desserts are certainly a cut above the rest. A wide range of in-flight entertainment kept us entertained throughout the flight. Return flight was even better than the first - Cabin crew were brilliant - the food quality was again high all of which contributed to a very enjoyable flight. The plane itself was in good shape - the whole point of the trip was to fly on the MD-11 and we were able to accomplish this with pleasure. We have used KLM in the past and will continue to use and recommend them in future as they can be relied upon to provide superb reliable service and to find solutions to problems swiftly when things go wrong.

Jakarta - Kuala Lumpur - Amsterdam - Helsinki in economy class. In general a very enjoyable experience. Only thing to complain about is the economy seat on the B777-300ER planes. Jakarta - Kuala Lumpur was a short hop of 1.5 hrs. Everything ran smoothly: check in at Jakarta was hassle free. Onboard a warm meal was served not the best but really good for airplane food. The salad and cake were far too cold. The cabin crew were very welcoming friendly and smiling. Overall the service was very good. I had booked myself a preferred seat (30€) from KLM website in advance. Stop over in Kuala Lumpur was very smooth. Clear announcements made onboard in Dutch and English. Arrival announcements were also made in Indonesian and Malaysian although these were not that comprehensive. Kuala Lumpur - Amsterdam was a 12 hour leg. The cabin crew were excellent. A hot meal and breakfast was served on the flight. After the meal I slept for 7 hours even though the seat was uncomfortable. Economy seats onboard the 777-300ER plane just ruins the day. The seat pitch is 32" and seat width 17.5". The seat is a little too hard in my opinion and the recline is just ridiculous. Even the 737 I flew to Helsinki had a superior economy seat compared to the long haul plane. Transfer in Amsterdam was very simple and easy no problems whatsoever. Nice and friendly staff on ground as well even though a little colder service. Amsterdam - Helsinki was a very pleasant flight. Packed flight. The cabin crew were once again very warm and smiling. The food served was two pieces of sandwich which I liked. Seat onboard this B737-800 aircraft was really comfortable and reclined more than onboard the 777. All flights were on time all the transfers were hassle free the food served onboard was tasty my bags arrived in Helsinki and the service provided by the cabin crew was excellent.

I flew a KLM B737-900ER twice and I was very impressed. This is my first time flying KLM (AMS-VCE-AMS) and it was excellent. The flight was on-time and check-in staff were very nice. I am a Skyteam "elite plus" member so I got to enter the KLM Crown Lounge once again very impressed. The seats were amazing for a European flight and they had tasty food for a 3 hour flight. The flight had a map of the flight on the screens and the FA's were all smiles and a funny safety demo on the first fight too! When we arrived almost all the baggage was off the plane before the jetway got to us! This airline was one of the best I have flown and will definitely fly KLM again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
BCN-AMS-GIG (Rio de Janeiro) March 10th. Had to fly KLM because no other option was left. In fact I did not expect anything but a bad flight. KLM went beyond its fame: just a horrific experience. BCN-AMS was delayed no explanation. Ground staff and cabin crew were both rude and ignorant: no lounge invitation despite of Premium Economy Ticket no respect of priority boarding. BCN-AMS was full of noisy Chinese passengers who left the plane extremely dirty after 30 minutes of flight. Breakfast" was a single Edam cheese sandwich no other choice so I could not eat at all. Transfer at AMS was extremely short and we had to run. Ground staff at Schiphol are just good-for-nothings. AMS-GIG: old tired Boeing 777-200. My Premium Economy ticket has been not taken into consideration and I found myself in Economy in the middle of the plane. Only one choice for meal again small portions food inedible. Snack" served prior to landing was laughable pizza OR crisps and when the trolley came to my row no pizza available. Cabin crew rude and impolite they spent all the time playing with their phones in the galley. Plane landed late at GIG luggage delivery took 1hr. Never again.

I flew on KL682 from Vancouver to Amsterdam two days ago. The seat pitch in Economy is too narrow (31") for a 10 hours flight. As headrests are not adjustable most passengers fumble with their pillow trying to squeeze it between themselves and the seat. It's quite pathetic to see actually. Results? Poor sleep and back pain. Otherwise service and IE are good.

KL809 KUL-CGK. Rude check-in counter crew at KUL flight delayed one hour because of late arrival from AMS. After one hour we boarded the aircraft then when we were near the runway suddenly the aircraft was stopped. Around 20 mins later the captain made an announcement saying that there were 2 passengers that were double booked and they were contacting ground staff regarding that matter. After a one hour wait finally the plane took off. Arrived in CGK 2 hours later than STA. I did not manage to catch my connection flight to DPS because of that. After 2 hours waiting we expected that they would serve us a hot dinner on board however they only served a vegetarian pie.

KL1477 on Feb 26th. After having issues with the booking the KLM customer service support staff were very slow to respond (certainly not within 24 hrs as claimed) and the responses were unhelpful. The actual flight was ok and close to on time (slightly delayed) in flight beverage/snack service was good. However the KLM website stopped recognizing my frequent flyer code (and all partner airline codes from what KLM tells me) and I have not been able to select my seats for 1.5 years since they had a website change in Nov 2012. To select a seat I must contact KLM directly for each flight which has proven problematic repeatedly. I found the customer support to be something that needs improvement both with the level of service and the consistency.

First and last time flying KLM. Terrible outbound and inbound experience. 8 day round trip. Outbound flight from Heathrow cancelled and I had to be rebooked onto an alternative airline with a 12 hour delay. Due to fly out on 15/02/12 on flight KL1000. Due to fly back on KL523 leaving Lusaka on 25/02/14 inbound flight grounded in Lusaka (Lusaka-AMS) for 24 hours! Poor communication from staff. I had paid for Economy Comfort seats lost them at connection in AMS. Terrible food service AMS to LHR - only egg sandwich served. My daughter doesn't eat egg and when asked for a biscuit or something else we were completely ignored. Supposed to connect from AMS to LHR on flight KL1017 on 25/02/14 but ended up on flight KL1007 on 26/02/24. Absolutely awful experience start to finish.

We recently returned from Malaga Spain on first Transavia Air Flight 2648 on Feb. 15 2014 to Amsterdam and then transferred to KLM Flight 301 to Montreal. My husband had suffered a severe leg injury the previous week and had a very difficult time walking. When I mentioned this to the staff of Transavia Air I was reassured that a wheelchair would be available and assistance given for our connection. This was handled expertly with compassion and care. Arrangements were also made by KLM for assistance to exit the plane retrieve baggage and connect to bus for the final leg of our trip to Ottawa. All staff on both planes were helpful courteous and made a long journey much easier.

AMS-ARN. Check-in went smoothly and the check in agent was polite helpful and friendly. Big plus for the Crown Lounge. The food was nice although there were only two things to choose from. Plenty of drinks though. I know it was a 2-hour flight so I didn't expect much but the service onboard was so so. Nothing special. I got my drinks and my meal nothing more. And please if you only serve cava on short haul flights then don't call it champagne please. I had some issues when I booked my flight. KLM promised to get back to me but they never did. Although I really enjoyed the lounge at AMS but because of issues during booking process the customer service the service onboard in the class I was traveling in I will try to avoid KLM in the future.

Amsterdam to San Francisco in a B747-400. Check-in was quick and easy the waiting was not so long due the amazing airport. The waiting time at the gate was not long. When we had boarded and found our seat we had a small delay due to seating problems. In the air we got beverages and delicious food. The personal entertainment system did not have amazing movies but that was because there weren't good movies that time of year. A good detail was that you could not look at the screen from the person sitting next to you. After a small amount of time they where handing out warm meals. I chose chicken with a beverage of my choice and after they collected my empty tray I got a bucket of vanilla ice cream. By the time we got to our luggage it had already been taken off the belt.

Business Class FRA via AMS to BKK 17 Jan. This was my first long haul with KLM. Check-in was done by a polite and informative staff member in FRA. The lounge was nothing exceptional but comfortable. The flight to AMS was operated by a Fokker. The middle seat was kept empty for business class. Crew were friendly and polite. The sandwiches and salad offered for this very short flight came in a very funky Dutch designed box. We had 90 min transit in AMS and paid a visit to their lounge. Very large with ample seating but very little choice of food. Flight to BKK was a B777-200 with the old business class seating. Unfortunately no flat beds on this route at the moment. I could not sleep the whole 10hr journey. That said the crew made up for the flaws. Customers were treated with respect. Although the crew were by age older than most flight attendants that you find on airlines these days their many years of experience showed. They obviously enjoyed doing their duties and did not disappear for the entire duration of the flight only to reappear 2 hrs prior to landing but paced up and down the aisles offering refreshments and snacks. Although the food is not elaborate it was simple and very tasty and was presented in fashionable Dutch designed dishes and cutlery.. I honestly enjoyed it more than some of the asian or middle east carriers food. Drinks were topped up constantly. They offered a good selection of films and music programmes. My return flight in Feb. will also be with KLM.

The new interior is fantastic. The seat is by far the biggest and most comfortable fully flat in Europe at the moment a dramatic improvement from the old World Business Class.

Hopefully they will complete the upgrade soon!

SFO-AMS. My check in at SFO was very smooth and friendly with a smile handled by Air France. Onboard it was a very warm welcome. And it was not just I. All the passengers surrounding me were served in the same professional and cordial way. Every request was met with a smile and professionally taken care of and everything was complimentary. I booked a seat with extra leg space because I planned to sleep. There was good interaction between crew and the passengers. Cockpit announcements were clear and relevant. I am starting to believe that something has fundamentally changed at KLM of course I can only judge from my last two flights. In my opinion KLM gives “Welcome on Board” its true meaning back. I will certainly look very closely at KLM’s schedule when planning my next travel.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-SFO. I ceased flying with KLM years ago because AMS is not my nearest international airport and I usually have plenty of airlines to choose from that used to offer better service on board. And I had some inferior experiences with very formal to even rude cabin attendants in the past. On this flight I chose simply because it fitted my schedule best. The check-in and security at AMS were efficient and smooth. Onboard an experienced crew that worked with enthusiasm to a passengers feel comfortable. I had some bad luck with my seat (38J) having some kind of a appliance on the floor limiting my foot space but that is the only negative note that I can think of. The staff service and hospitality were better than in business class of some airlines.

KL862 NRT-AMS Duration: 12 hrs day flight 16/1/14 Seat 1A. Most probably the best business class product of any European carrier right now. The new KLM business class on the 747 is a totally new generation product and completely in the other end of the scale compared to the outdated old product. Great privacy (especially in the single seats 1A and 4A) with fully flat beds stylish colors and designs. Wide chairs with lots of support in all directions matching pillows and blankets. Service is typically European with a certain Dutch touch which is great. Flight attendants were clearly proud of their new product and for very good reasons. Long haul flying suddenly became fun again.

As I'm Dutch I've flown KLM very frequently for the past 20 years but this was the first time I had a claustrophobic feeling when sitting down. It was a 777-300 and the aisle has been made extremely narrow in these models. The trolley's are constantly bumping into seats all economy passengers are very close to each other and to top it off the high cabin temperature prevented passengers from falling asleep. No-one used blankets which rarely happens. Despite that the Dutch are among the tallest people in the world KLM's seats will never suit us and knees are fixed in the seat in front. My earlier flight from KL to AMS was with an old MH airplane but at least there the seats were wide enough and ample leg space.

Luxembourg - Stockholm - Luxembourg (via AMS). Truly a textbook excellent customer service experience. Web for tickets and check-in worked well. Phone service to change return flights and confirm Economy Comfort seats was very good (clear instructions service-minded call centre staff etc.). Ground staff at AMS were fantastic (KL 1115 AMS-ARN on 30th Dec). Economy seats on Fokker 70 and Economy Comfort seats on 737 were both very comfortable. All cabin personnel were pleasant and helpful (travelling with an infant). Particularly on KL 1110 ARN-AMS 14th Jan. Communication from flight deck (Captain) during severe turbulence on KL 1745 AMS - LUX was clear explicative and reassuring. After web check-in glitch (assigned wrong seats after flight rebooking) phone contact solved problem immediately.

Lusaka - Istanbul via Amsterdam. KLM must have the smallest seats granted by law. Flight was on time crew were friendly only one negatives on the flight out the little box proudly claiming Dutch Cheese on the dinner tray was a wedge of processed Melrose. The return flight goes over Lusaka to Harare and then back to Lusaka. While waiting an hour on the plane in Harare the mass cleaning crew come on board you can't use the toilets no drinks are served you feel like you're in the way as you lift your legs for the vacuum cleaner. Emirates also fly the Lusaka / Harare route but at least have the consideration to stop in Lusaka then Harare so the plane is empty for cleaning before setting off again. Premium economy offers little for the extra cost. Service & Meals are the same as economy and so is the seat all you get for your money is 4 inches increased seat pitch.

EDI-AMS-DXB and DXB-AMS-EDI. Both flights with KLM excellent service friendly cabin crew and comfortable seats. Started off from Edinburgh airport for a 1 hour and 15 min flight to Amsterdam nice crew on board that flight but could have been friendlier. 1 hour transfer time in Amsterdam nice and helpful staff there and also very friendly! On the flight Dubai the crew were very friendly indeed the IFE was good and the food was also very nice. On my return flight from Dubai the crew was really friendly and helpful the food was nice and the IFE was even better than the last flight and the flight back to Edinburgh from Amsterdam was really nice once again friendly staff even friendlier than my outbound flight! All flights were on time and it was also very nice of KLM to give every passenger a £30 when you spend £150 on board but I didn't use it though.

I flew the 737-800 from Amsterdam to Venice in economy class. The Dutch airline may not have the latest in product equipment the planes can be rather old however I love their use of technology and pr to create a wonderful flying experience. Checking in in Amsterdam on my flight to Venice was easy and totally automated. No more humanoids to deal with including baggage drop-off. Online check-in is also very efficient clearly outlining the steps with various additional options given including a last minute upgrade for a fee. The service can be jarring the meal rather simple and the seat very tight (although I have to say that I do like the seats recline angle which is not as straight-up as usual in take-off/landing mode) but perhaps KLM makes up for some of this with clever use of technology and marketing.

Manchester-Amsterdam-Beijing. KLM definitely has the friendliest crew of any company that I've flown so far. There seems to be unlimited food and ice cream all served by staff who seem happy. The IFE is good as usual too much unfunny American junk but less than some others. The seat width was quite generous for Economy too. I'd advise paying extra for the premium meal.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I purchased 2 economy return tickets Dubai - Amsterdam - New York for myself and my wife. I found the aircraft comfort relatively good compared to other airlines. Staff are friendly but a bit "stiff" inflexible. When asking for a drink before the food service they said only after food service - still 45 minutes away. In the mean time at least 20 times they walked passed my seat. The main issue we faced was with our baggage. In New York at check- in one bag was 24.5kg and the other was 18kg. They still forced me to unpack the lighter bag and move 1.5kg to the other bag. I found this utterly irritating especially since the tickets where bought together and our combined allowance was higher. The only answer I got was that its the policy. We took a few days break in Schiphol. There we had an even worse baggage experience at the check in. We used one of those self baggage check in machines because the normal desk had a huge queue. We checked our first bag without a problem but the 2nd bag was 24.2kg. The machine refused to accept the overweight bag and pointed us to KLM staff. Looking at the queue we removed 1kg of clothes and put it in our hand baggage. But what a hassle and that despite that we were far below our total baggage quota for 2 persons. It may deter me from flying KLM next time.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I booked 2 seats in economy with KLM - Cape Town to Luxembourg return. I choose certain seats and paid a premium of about R5000 and my tickets reflected the seats in which I wanted to sit. On checking in at Cape Town my wife and I were placed in different seats well apart from each other. I complained and it was rectified. On return the same thing happened and I was told to check at Amsterdam to have the situation corrected. Again we were in different seats and not what we had paid for and apart from each other. The lady at the KLM counter said she was sorry but could not do anything. I had to upgrade at a cost of R25000 so that my wife and I could sit together. They shift you about no matter what you pay for and then say sorry. Thereby spoiling my holiday!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Very comfortable and direct flights. I was flying from Calgary to Kilimanjaro and return with KLM. Always enjoy the service. Several hour delay in Dar es Salaam though made for the return trip to be a little stressful. I would also say that the "snack meal" or second meal served should be improved the pizza stick was awful! on both flights! I would far sooner have fruits and veggies.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Harare to Amsterdam on A330-200. I paid business class fare expecting to get some sleep during the flight. Business class seats described as 'flat beds' but they were nowhere near that. Just an angular recline which is not comfortable at all. Would have been better off paying for an economy class seat. since I didn't notice any difference.

KL 1131 / 1128 AMS-CPH and CPH-AMS. 23/12 and 26/12. Although I'm a Flying Blue member I do travel with other airlines so I think I can assess KLM position to other benchmarks. I am actually quite satisfied with KLM. Service is above average too often it's the passenger being rude. Food is ok not better not worse it's an airplane after all. Personally I think KLM is ahead of many competitors when it comes to online check in and self-service luggage drop-off (at least at their home-base AMS) it's far more advanced and smooth than most airlines. Although my last flight was in a 737 without entertainment I know that their entire long-haul fleet now has proper personal entertainment systems so that's good. They were a bit late on their 747s though. I will use them in the future. It's important to distinguish what you can attribute to an airline and what to an airport or worse your own behavior.

KL0438 19th December. I paid a large premium to travel business class from Abu Dhabi to Luxembourg via Amsterdam in December. Despite being told that beds were flat they were anything but with beds reclining only to an angle that left you slipping down. Plane was old seats uncomfortable food inedible. My wife and kids flew economy a few days earlier and tell me this was an even worse experience. Luggage allowance is also useless. On the way back despite having 5 of of us travelling and only 4 bags we were told we'd have to pay a 75 euro premium for being slightly over on a couple of bags. We were still way below total weight allowance.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
On 9th December boarded on a flight from KUL to CGK. They served hot snacks which looked like hot vegetarian snacks but they weren't very filling. While in the holding pattern the entertainment system abruptly shuts down which was unexpected. For the entire flight I only listened to music and played games. I would give 5 for that. On the other hand the TV shows and movies in the entertainment system didn't interest me.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew today from Dubai to Amsterdam. After reading these reviews I am wondering which airline workers they had on their plane. Everyone was so thoughtful and nice on the flight. Take off and landing was smooth sailing. Food today were great. About an hour or two in I was offered eggs with bread yoghurt butter jam potatoes or pancakes. Drinks were constantly being provided. Lunch was provided. Simple hot cheese sandwiches or spicy chicken were options. Again drinks were provided. Hot towels and headphones were also given.

I made a late booking to fly Manchester (Amsterdam) Prague on 1st December return on 12th. So far so good. Unfortunately the flight on 1st was delayed - apparently to replace the co-pilot's seat - long enough to miss the connection. I spent a pleasant night in a hotel. The return journey was also delayed long enough for my luggage to be booked on a flight the next morning. In fact I could have made the connection and was turned back at the gate. (The last flight of the day was already full with a waiting list. Another pleasant night at a hotel). I had as it happens arrived at the airport at about 6.30 am for my 1405 flight so I asked if it was possible to take one of the earlier flights. The answer was 'yes' but there would be a charge I declined the offer. Bearing in mind that problems pile up during the day it must surely be to the airlines advantage to get passengers on their way earlier if possible. I had already paid for my ticket I had my luggage with me and I had not yet checked in.

RIO-AMS-BUD. The first leg of the trip was AMS-FCO with KLM and on to GRU with Alitalia. As a Dutch national living between AMS and BUD I had a separate ticket BUD-AMS that same morning connecting in AMS for above mentioned schedule which was booked through Expedia on a separate ticket. 10 days before departure tried to select a seat and modify the travel class for the leg RIO-AMS to Economy Comfort but could not access my booking. Check- in at BUD airport not overly friendly. Even though I had received an email from KLM alerting me that online check- in had commenced hey could not see any other booking and tagged my luggage only to AMS. Re-checked luggage in AMS but they also could not understand or solve issue. Online check-in Rio to AMS opens some 30 hours prior to departure. Tried to check-in and change seat selection and travel class online to no avail. System would only indicate that seat selection is not possible and check-in should be at airport. Eventually changed that during check-in at GIG which was friendly and hassle-free. Flight itself (GIG-AMS leg) was delayed by more than one hour but arrival was only 30 min behind schedule. Seat (first row of economy comfort) is comfortable enough and recline allows for relatively good sleep. Crew friendly attentive and professional. Plane clean. Food and entertainment sub-par. Would have given a 7 for the experience but for the glitch in the entire booking management process and the abysmal customer service feedback.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
MCT-AMS-MCT. This has been by far the worst long-haul flight I have had. Grotty "crown" lounge at MCT airport disorganised and unhelpful ground staff. Aircraft was an old Airbus A330-200 very cramped seats. No amenity kit for a night flight no special food for Premium Economy pitch size is nearly the same as regular economy. Our flight arrived 1 hour late at AMS with no apology. Return was horrible. Incredibly rude ground staff at Schiphol access to lounge has been denied to me despite of Sky Priority access and Premium Economy ticket. Security staff ignorant and incompetent. I could say the same about cabin crew: impolite. Same A330-200 we were packed like sardines. Food inedible and served cold. My IFE was not working and was never reset. My luggage was missing at MCT and only came 2 days after with no apology. Never again.

MSE-AMS-LIM-GIG-AMS-MSE Economy. Headed to Lima Peru and was surprised to find no direct flights from London and didn't want to mess about in Miami or travel with Iberia long haul from Madrid. So used the newish route from Manston (Kent International) near Ramsgate for short 35 min hop to AMS for a no trouble connection for direct 12hr flight to Lima. Manston is a pleasure to fly from tiny airport with KLM only operator on small 80 seater jet. To Lima was 777-300 flight full but service was excellent great inflight entertainment and comfortable enough seats for daylight flight. Return flight from Rio was overnight flight another excellent onboard service luckily not full so had a row of 3 seats to self so very comfortable. AMS back to MSE slightly delayed but only took 8 minutes for touchdown taxi unloading immigration customs and in car.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I fly about 60 times a year with KLM. Service seems to get less and less to a point where it is unacceptable. Last flight was on 7/12 AMS-SHA. After boarding in AMS they left us in the plane for about 3 hours during aircraft repair before we left off. No catering during these hours except for one glass of water and a cookie. Cabin crew was plain rude and uninterested during the whole flight. Makes you wonder whether it is a good policy to put your older staff in the front of the plane.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I flew with my family AMS - Curacao - AMS in the new business class. I have to admit great seats now. Total flat bed! The food is tasty and service is great. We all enjoyed flying with KLM. Surely I recommend it to other travellers.

Barcelona - Amsterdam - (supposed to be Dulles/IAD) - Minneapolis - Dulles. The check in and baggage check in at Barcelona airport was total chaos. The lines were mixed the self-serve kiosks were moody and the staff was pretty cold. Flight to Amsterdam was fine. Got through gate security in Amsterdam 10 minutes from boarding and they moved our gate. Five minutes at the new gate and they cancelled our flight. KLM had given our plane to another flight and cancelled our flight due to "mechanical issues". We were told to sprint down to a transfer desk where they held us in a queue with "no information" for about an hour. During this time they were already re-booking people who had access to the lounges. They slowly filtered us through the transfer desk by handing out "now serving" numbers. It was another hour before we made it to the desk and were told we were being rebooked on Delta through Minneapolis boarding now at a distant gate. Only one of our bags arrived in Minneapolis. We were told the others would meet us in Dulles. Had to stand in line at the lost baggage desk in Dulles for another hour 12 hours after we were supposed to have been in originally. The Delta staff were very helpful but we were told that the bags had never reached them so it was KLM's issue. When we contacted KLM they originally said it wasn't their problem contact Delta. The bags arrived 24 hours later having never left Amsterdam in the first place. This is the second time I have been stranded by KLM in Amsterdam. I was hoping their service had improved in 10 years but unfortunately I was mistaken.

AMS-DXB-AMS 23/11 and 27/11. Both sectors with (old) MD11 good food and drinks perfect crew inflight entertainment ok but old. Cabin a bit noisy. MD11 KLM will replaced in Oct 2014 KLM have to compete with Emirates A380 on same route which makes it difficult new KLM B787 Dreamliner equipment is coming but we have to wait until 2016.

Amsterdam-Atlanta-Amsterdam. Good food personal TV with lots of programs and movies to choose from. The legroom was not that good in economy but economy comfort has no problems.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
My wife and I fly economy with KLM a lot in most instances we have found this airline very efficient the staff have been friendly and helpful when needed. You do get some flights when there are grumpy staff maybe overworked or tired. Seating is not to bad if you take time to choose your seat when you book.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Johannesburg-Amsterdam Premium Economy. Good boarding everything on time. Fairly new 777 seats quite comfortable. Service ok but not outstanding. Food was acceptable but nothing to write home about. Entertainment program a little disappointing very few new movies. Duty free took forever one of the payment terminals was broken. Early arrival in Amsterdam. A classic 'average' for a long flight.

AMS-Curacao 25th November KL 785. Pleasant way to get there well taken care of on board. Pity that the Flight attendant on our aisle wasn't so nice like the rest of the crew. Why not change your job if you don't like dealing with people no smile not even a look at you when taking meal orders.

From AMS to Nice. The flight was on time. Served a very fresh sandwich. On the way back to AMS served alcohol which surprised me. After cockpit crew finished their paper work they came out of the cockpit and said goodbye to passengers. Very polite and professional.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew from Rome to San Francisco last September as an option having booked through Air France. Unlike Air France there was no opportunity to choose my seat even at check-in. The transfer in Amsterdam was absurd. Why list a 1-hr transfer if the 2 KLM gates are miles apart and the passport check-through is bottlenecked like rush hour traffic? Made it to the gate 2 minutes late; luckily the flight was delayed anyway. The food. High fat everything and lots of it. After lunch (meatballs mashed potatoes cheese white pudding dessert with giant chocolate balls) the attendant came through and asked "Ice cream or chips? Later pizza. The intercom was impossible to hear. I will never fly KLM again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Didn't fly them for a while because I found them expensive. Flew JFK-AMS B747 combi. At the gate they didn't articulate while calling for boarding. Received just breakfast o/b. Very old plane needs to be refurbished badly seats IFE screen. In-flight product is very well done reasonably good food and good presentation. Wouldn't want to fly the old workhorse again but KLM did provide a nice flight.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Just finished a trip from Panama to Amsterdam with KLM. Was very disappointed with the booking system and customer service. When booking online I reserved the Comfort seats both ways and requested special meals. Both were not recognised when I arrived to the airport to check-in. When I tried calling to fix the issue with my return flight it was useless not one person who answered the phones or emails was able to help. They all kept blaming each other. Luckily I had a printed copy of my reservation confirmation which helped me get the comfort seats in both flights but the special meals were nether there. I don't know why KLM offers these options and charges them to the customer if the system does not work and it is not going to recognise it.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I have flown with KLM many times (MME AMS ORD and return) never a problem all the staff and flight crew are very helpful and friendly the Dutch are just friendly people and it shows in the level of service I have used other airlines and not had good experiences with them. The KLM flight crews are always coming round with food drinks and snacks the entertainment is plentiful with many new films to choose from but more importantly they seem to fly on time or make time up I really cannot fault them so far.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-FCO-AMS. Cabin crew friendly and catering was really nice with two fresh sandwiches (morning flight) and coffee etc for free. However there wasn't in flight entertainment because it took only 2hours. I would fly KLM again as Schiphol is my home airport.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew Mexico to TLV via Amsterdam old 747 but cabin in good condition and clean had the emergency exit seat so lots of legroom even though the seats are so narrow. The new in flight system is excellent with plenty of choice. Cabin crew and food good and the usual KLM style. Its a good solid airline that can be relied upon. Schipol is also a very convenient airport to transit through. Will fly them again for sure.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
GVA-AMS-PTY with return in Business Class the rest of the legs were in Economy or Premium Economy. Overall an excellent service excellent food served. IFE is good while not at the level of the EK and SQ systems. Business Class seat does not offer a flat bed experience.

Aberdeen to Amsterdam and the service is high cost for what you get! Even if you don't book a fare that covers bags you need to pay for it. These airlines charge far too much in some routes with a very low cost service!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
ORD-AMS-AUH return. B747 and A330 aircraft in Economy Comfort. Extra space in Economy Comfort well worth it. Crews were all great and service was with a smile. Food was good and drinks while limited choice were OK. The Amarula after dinner was a nice touch. Inflight entertainment had good selection of films and music. Would definitely fly with KLM again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Amsterdam to Calgary. 19 Oct 2013. On time nice people professional trouble free piloting. Announcements from cockpit garbled poor diction and at times not audible. Main course atrocious slop. Now we are down to ground meats only and side order of vegetable is 2 slops. Mashed potato and mashed overcooked something. Almost like mashed potato. The salad was some kind of grated vegetable drowned in grease. The other flight grated carrots with no dressing. I wish I'd brought a sandwich. Desserts were ok. I shall make a separate comment about handicap service. Perhaps just do not fly through Amsterdam as the ground help is atrocious just use other carriers.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew Brussels - Amsterdam - Bonaire in business. Leg BRU-AMS was short and OK. The leg AMS-BON was mediocre. Nothing fancy old plane. They advertise to redecorating the planes but this was still not done. Service is very cold you have the impression that you have to do them a favor and not the other way around. Food quality was very basic and same for quality of wine. Last year when we flew the same routing there was not enough food for business class passengers as it was a late flight. Feel that they reduce on everything. If there was another airline who flew straight to Bonaire I would certainly not fly KLM anymore.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Travelled Johannesburg to Amsterdam on the evening 777 flight on 11 October. The rear economy cabin in the 777 is nine seats across - compared to ten seats in many other airlines - which feels quite spacious. The service on the flight was outstanding and up to KLM's usual high standards dinner and breakfast were excellent and choice of entertainment very good. The staff worked hard throughout a long night flight even managing to keep smiling during some sever turbulence. For good value economy travel KLM remains my favourite airline.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
We have travelled a lot and have used many different airlines. After reading the reviews we were worried and not looking forward to flying KLM London - Lima in October 2013. We were pleasantly surprised from start to finish of both legs. The seat was reasonably comfortable even though it did not recline very much. Also the seats are not too close to the seats in front as on some airline. The inflight entertainment was fantastic (much better than on Virgin Atlantic which was so antiquated) with many choices. The cabin staff were very good bringing water and juices every so often during the flight. Food was served four times during the flights - dinner/lunch ice cream sandwiches and breakfast/lunch.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
TLV-AMS-JNB on 9th October in world business class if compared to other airlines this can still be called a business class. TLV-AMS on a 737-900 nice flight good service even if though I tried to sleep most of the flight. AMS-JNB older 777-200 with 2-3-2 configuration in business class. Seats are old and I felt thrown back to the 1970'S. Seats do not recline as modern bus class seats do so no way of getting some sleep on this very long day time flight. The food remains the worst on European airlines the food I received was tasteless. KLM is improving its business class with modern seats but I think they should review the catering as well. Conclusion KLM business class is not worth its price and did not enjoy this flight.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Amsterdam to Buenos Aires KL707 13 September 2013. The worst flight I have experienced in 40 years of flying. Bad from so-called "security" through to arrival. Security staff at Amsterdam were surly and very rude. On the flight there were babies crying groups of people standing in front of my seat talking. Crowded seating. Then towards the end of the flight one of the flight attendants tipped water on me said "it's only water" then scuttled off: no apology no offer to dry it. I upgraded my return trip EZE-AMS to business class - it had better be of a higher standard.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew BKK-MAN April 2013 with a 7 month old baby. Paid a little extra to have seats at the back of the aircraft. Flight out slightly older 777 seat not that comfortable and screen too small. Flight attendants the best I have met slightly more mature ladies with children so they really know how to help you out with a baby. They took it turns to carry my daughter around the cabin and went out their way to be helpful with food. Schipol airport is the best airport I have ever been to for small children. Dedicated lounge staff changing facilities cots for babies playgrounds all free. Food at Schipol great value and quality. Manchester is awful no help with luggage. no baby facilities welcome to blighty (not). Second flight to Manchester efficient and well run. Flight home was on a very windy day flight had a go around at Schipol. Schipol again fantastic for the little one. We had 90kg of luggage (even a baby bath) and KLM took care of everything for a small fee. Flight home to BKK again outstanding cabin staff (no dumb pretty trolly dollies) 777 though needs a refit. Buy some A380/ dreamliners KLM and you would be one of the absolute best airlines. Highly recommended for babies.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I flew from NYC to Amsterdam and back to NYC in full planes that had such tight seating that it made it very uncomfortable. KLM is squeezing every tiny last bit of space from the cabin. The little entertainment screens are so small and of such low resolution that they are unpleasant to watch. The earphones are the cheapest of the cheap and useless. In both trips the bathrooms were smelly and unclean from the start. Not flying again with them.

I traveled on flight # KL 6120 from Amsterdam to Detroit on 10/1/13 and was extremely impressed with the customer service!

I would definitely fly KLM again and will recommend them to others! My only complaint is that my TV remote didn't work very well.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-OTP. 17/9/2013 Economy-class seat 22F B737 on time. Nice and comfortable flight. Cabin crew friendly and professional pilots informative food and drinks were above average. This airline has a feel of durability and "old-school" quality in it's operations. Also I would like to note that Schiphol is not the perfect airport. Still you can almost literally park your car in front of main building walk 5 minutes check-in walk 5 min baggage drop-off and that at a airport that handles 50+ million passengers per year.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew from Norwich to Amsterdam and then into JFK. The seats were roomy the entertainment good the meal was actually very nice and the cabin crew some of the friendliest I have come across. My mum needed a wheelchair at JFK and Amsterdam and I had booked this beforehand. As soon as we got on board the Amsterdam flight we were told that a wheelchair would await us off the plane. Same happened on the flight to the US. It was a great flight for someone (like me) who isn't keen on flying! Flying from Norwich is a real bonus for me as I only live 25 mins away from Norwich airport. Bit disappointed in the way back as JFK to Amsterdam was with Delta and although I believe they are part of KLM they weren't anywhere near as good. Meal disappointing and cabin crew not so friendly. Had to ask them about the wheelchair situation. Seats were cramped which was a real downer for a night flight.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Norwich to Montreal via Amsterdam. First sector on Fokker 70. Pleasant flight crew courteous in a mechanical kind of way biscuit tea and coffee were served. Amsterdam to Montreal was on MD-11 which surprised me since I didn't think that they were still in service. Food was adequate crew friendlier than those from Norwich. However after getting over the novelty of MD-11 I think KLM should seriously think of replacing them on such a busy long route as Montreal. The seats are excellent and roomy however this is a long trans-atlantic flight and putting an aircraft with no individual IFE's on it is inexcusable. Also the seats are old and worn and the aircraft quite noisy. All in all an acceptable flight but nothing special.

MSE-AMS-ABZ. Tried the new KLM service from Manston (Kent International) to Amsterdam then connecting to Aberdeen. MSE is a tiny airport with KLM sole operator check in security and loading was such an easy process. Flight time was only 35 mins in Fokker 70 jet. Comfortable and staff very attentive for such a short flight. Connection in Amsterdam seamless. Was going to fly BA from Heathrow but from where I live the option of flying from a UK airport to another UK airport via the Netherlands was quicker and cheaper. Have booked to go to Lima via MSE/AMS as a result.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew Business from Denpasar to Singapore after paying for an upgrade at Check-in. The shared lounge at Denpasar was not the best - food was so-so and access didn't even include free WiFi but from there the experience was great. Boarding was painless; the cabin crew were really friendly yet professional the plane was well-presented. Food was reasonable but probably of lower standard than some other airlines and as noted elsewhere the IFE product was competitive with other airlines. The stand-out though was the crew - they were brilliant and really made the flight pleasant.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Zurich to Chicago with a layover in Amsterdam. My flights to Chicago were wonderful. They upgraded the plane to a 747 from a smaller aircraft and made announcements on board that after we were in the air they would move people around. I was moved from an aisle seat with 2 people next to me to an aisle seat with 2 empty seats next to me. I found the food service quite good and the flight attendants very friendly. While I would have liked a better selection of movies to watch the amount of TV shows I could choose from made up for it. However the flight home was a bit different. When I checked in at the airport I was given a middle seat although I had specifically booked aisle seats for my entire trip even paying to upgrade when I needed to. After a bit of hassle at the check in counter this was resolved by giving me an aisle seat in the exit row. The exit row seats are very narrow I had to wedge into it and if you were very large it would be very uncomfortable. At take off and landing the flight attendant who sat facing me took away everything on our laps including coats blankets and the boo I was reading. I understand putting bags away but really my coat and book? While the food and service seemed almost as good as the first flight for some reason they kept forgetting to give drinks to my row they would start at the row behind me. I will definitely consider KLM again but they would have to be the cheaper option for me to do so.

IAD-AMS Aug 31 KL 652. Got a very good deal on an upgrade and was quite pleased. Service was friendly and sincere. Drinks and food were of very good quality. The amenity kits are standard but come in a trendy pouch. The movies selection is decent (and I like the fact that you can pause the movie or start a new one and not have to wait). At the end of the flight the Delft blue house gift is a classy touch. Most airlines threw those nice touches out in the past 15 years. Will fly again.

AMS-VIE. Overall a good flight experience. The only thing is the lack of entertainment. But that is the problem with most airlines. Good service from the cabin crew. Plenty of food and drinks. I also liked the cockpit crew who keeps us updated about the progress of the flight.

I have used KLM many times and only a handful of flights were decent. During my last flight KLM lost my Economy Premium / Extra booking and thus I was placed in Economy. This was however not nearly my largest annoyance with KLM. The largest annoyance by far is the staff service which on average is quite appalling. Staff are unfriendly and inattentive at best and if you're unlucky outright rude. The "call attendant" button/light over your head never even mind pushing it its only there for show at KLM. Appalling service both on and off the air planes. Unfortunately I live in the Netherlands so I'll probably fly with them again soon. Not looking forward to it.

Tel Aviv-Amsterdam-Tel Aviv. I flew twice with KLM: once with the Boeing 777-200ER and once with the Boeing 737-900ER. The meals were ok. The Boeing 777 was very good and the entertainment was great. On the Boeing 737 the entertainment was less good but the flight was good anyway.

Flight KL1293 from Amsterdam to Edinburgh. Had 2 kg overweight from my baggage's but that was OK. Flight departed on time. Very friendly staff and a decent snack and drink for a flight of 1 hour and 15 minutes. Didn't had to wait long for baggage so for me this flight was 9 out of 10.

Flew LUX-AMS-Quito and back from Guayaquil. KLM very efficient first class staff and service. Fantastic quality on board entertainment. Seat not great for sleeping sloping and you slide off! Couple of problems both directions with seat positions not working but was able to change seats due to lots of availability. Only downside: appalling check-in at Guayaquil don't bother with automatic check-in then bag drop it is much slower than just checking in. But that's just a local problem nothing to do with KLM though maybe they should use their influence to improve the situation.

AMS-BKK return in business. Overall a most enjoyable experience. Boarding was poor. All sky blue members were invited to board at the same time as Biz passengers. This led to a mad rush. On board service was very friendly and professional. Staff on this flight were mature and very experienced. Fast track immigration at BKK was most welcome. A very pleasant experience.

AMS-MAN 18/8. The return trip was even more disappointing. I hadn't realised that KLM is now all self service (including baggage drop off) and nobody knew what they were doing! KLM staff were few and far between and when I did find one was spoken to in a very unhelpful and abrupt manner. Again my seats were changed and very poor level of service on board. Will avoid for another 15 years!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
MAN-AMS 15/8. After a series of poor flights I hadn't flown KLM for 15 years giving them another chance proved to be a mistake! Check in was chaos and involved a 30 min wait. On their website they make a big thing about seat selection at time of booking yet on both sectors my seats were changed without apology or explanation. Although the cabin crew were friendly service is the bare minimum - a drink and 4 tiny biscuits! Not even a newspaper. Very poor overall for a national carrier.

Flew Amsterdam - Chicago on a 747-400. Whilst I can't really fault the in flight service it is hard to enjoy anything when you are allowed only the room that you might give a battery chicken. Most miserable long haul flight I have experienced.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flight 743 yesterday August 31 from Amsterdam to Lima. I was in the business class and have never experienced such uncomfortable seats impossible to lie down normally the bottom of the seat is slanted down so your feet are way down and you can slide - moreover it is so narrow that one arm falls in the alley. During the flight I pointed out to the flight attendant in the business class that there was no more toilet paper and she thanked me and put a new roll you would think she could check the other bathroom no. Some time later I was in that one no toilet paper either both rolls empty. This is not acceptable. Not once did any of the cabin staff make any effort to communicate during the flight with the passengers. They just did what needed to be done and finished (except check the lavatories). Glad I am going back with Air France.

LHR-AMS-LHR. Booked flight in May flew July. Not informed by anyone that a suitcase will require £26 surcharge. On return managed to dig up my AF/KLM frequent flyer card to avoid suitcase penalty. All airport staff at LHR and AMS indifferent and suggested it was my fault for carrying a suitcase. As such everyone else did carry cabin baggage only which caused a lack of storage space on board people checking in bags at the aircraft door (with no charge) and complete chaos on board both flights. Cabin crew good and polite a reflection of Dutch personality. Check in at Schipol airport via a machine for boarding pass then a second long queue to print your own baggage tag (after payment of course) and then load your own bag into machine oneself. Complete chaos again due to people not understanding the process how to stick tags on. Staff rude or indifferent. I would not fly with KLM again in a hurry low cost airline with high cost.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Very pleasant flights LED-AMS-MAD and back. The good things started from picking up the tickets at KLM offices in St.Pete the staff were very polite and well trained. On-time boarding without any problem. Friendly crew comfortable seats and rather good meal. The only one disappointment was no entertainment on-board at all. Ready to repeat the experience again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
CDG-AMS as part of a trip to China. Check-in very busy - not enough AF staff at Sky Priority for this busy time of year but managed to check bag all the way to China at the very last minute. Booked economy and got upgraded to Business upon check-in for the CDG-AMS segment. Was initially told they wouldn't be able to provide a meal at check-in and was told again once on-board by an apologetic AF rep who got onboard to inform me personally that there wouldn't be a meal for me. Ended up being served an AF meal which was nice as I didn't expect anything. Some passengers were served a KLM meal while others were served an AF meal which seemed strange somehow and created some confusion with the crew. Nice quick and efficient service from the KLM crew on this very short flight.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flown from AMS to LHR on July 11th and from WAW to AMS on August 19th. Both flights on-time. Great customer service on board and at Amsterdam airport from KLM staff. Excellent food and beverages and highly trained and efficient cabin crew. Will certainly recommend and fly with them again in the future.

BRS-AMS-ATL Fokker 70 and A330-300 8/8/13. Flight BRS-AMS on time take off. Cabin crew always friendly on the city hopper service. My son and I were the only ones in BC. Service quick for a short flight 2 drinks and lunch. Arrive AMS on time and bus transfer to main terminal left us with a bit of a rush to D gates. A small delay getting security clearance but still onto plane with plenty of time to spare. Service has clearly improved in the World Business class. Food much better than previous trips all served on a stylish black tray. Service good and with a smile. Had a couple of visits from the flight leader. Generally good experience. Not too many interruptions from flight deck unlike some US airlines. Pretty good entertainment. Not touch sensitive screens but fairly easy to navigate. Great movie choices. Seats are not entirely lie flat but for 9 hour flight they didn't seem uncomfortable.

AMS-FRA. Good flight on a KLM city hopper Fokker 70 professional crew and adequate flight info during the short flight. Taxi at FRA was very long after landing at remote landing strip (25 min).

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
In general I find the service of KLM terrible. On my last trip from Birmingham England to Amsterdam a stewardess just before we should have begun to taxi for take off came down the isle and said that I was too heavy to sit in an exit row seat and will need to change seats. I am not too heavy the stewardess had called the incorrect name. The other person in the exit row was not much heavier than myself though. The stewardess was followed by the co- pilot who said that we all had to be very quick because KLM was loosing a lot of money waiting. They should not have asked us to leave our seats and they also should not have waited for just before takeoff to do so. I am 6 ft 190lbs. I do not like their seats on their long haul planes. They give me a back ache as it seams that they have a type of lumbar support which I find too low.

My family and I travelled from South Africa via Amsterdam to Leeds UK. We had requested Hindu meals and I must say that I was disgusted by the food served to us. We were given only vegetarian meals the quality of which left a lot to be desired. A Hindu meal does not mean strictly vegetarian. I probably would not have minded so much if what was served to us was tasty.

LUX-AMS-Almaty return all in 48 hours. Booked economy extra seat 10B a bargain at EUR 67 per flight so ample legroom well worth the money. A330 rather new good and generous catering decent IFE but most of all excellent crew who seem to spot passengers in economy with FF-status. KLM beats Lufthansa hands down in this route in flying experience a pity they do not fly to Almaty daily. Already alone for the crew experience I would not doubt to fly KLM again.

Bahrain to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi. Check in was fast and the flight to AD took of on time. for a 45 minute flight the service was very good the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Small snacks and drinks were served. AD-Amsterdam was excellent. The inflight entertainment was amazing there was a wide range of movies and TV shows to choose from. Breakfast (pancakes or eggs) was delicious. The cabin crew were extremely attentive and friendly. They all spoke fluent English. Drinks and small snacks were regularly served. My only problem was the seats. There was little legroom and space. Other than that it was an excellent service. Would definitely fly with them again.

We were booked 3 months in advance Johannesburg to Amsterdam. Arriving at the airport 3 hours ahead of takeoff we were told that the flight was overbooked and we were on standby. This was the first leg of a flight to Barcelona for an important business trip. There would have been serious losses to ourselves had we not been able to travel. No airline has ever done this to us before. Some pleading with the staff got us on to the flight but seated a couple of rows apart. I would never trust KLM with a flight booking ever again. I would arrange my travel plans to specifically avoid travelling with them.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Deliberately overbooked flight from Amsterdam to Vancouver. Would not allow on line check-in said have to check in at airport which I now believe meant they were overbooked. Would not acknowledge this at point of departure Vienna where alternate routings were available. It seemed that the persons bumped all had carry on luggage only - a coincidence or does KLM select by whether they have to get luggage off the plane? After the flight left without us it Took KLM nearly 5 hours to get us an alternate flight now departing the following day. Staff were somewhat apologetic about the long time dealing with this. KLM understaffed the people dealing with overbooking and there were so many overbooked flights they could not manage. They gave us different information one person saying they would assist us to upgrade on return next person saying first had no authority. I will never fly KLM again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
IAD-AMS-RIX (Air Baltic codeshare on the intra-Europe portion) on 9th July returning 17th. The fare was surprisingly low for this time of year (under $900) but the service was top-dollar. Seats on A330-200 were maybe a tiny bit tight but basically comfortable overall (took an aisle seat toward the back with fewer seats in the rows). A full plane but any situations were quickly dealt with by the friendly helpful cabin crews departures and arrivals were quite punctual and connections were handled perfectly. Decent meals (with freshly warmed bread rolls served from a separate basket - a nice touch) and plenty of drinks available throughout the flight. (I don't use the IFE apart from the flight tracker so no opinion there.) All in all on this showing KLM is a solid choice for transatlantic travel - especially at such a low fare.

Sao Paulo - Amsterdam - London and back. Their website was very efficient and online check-in worked fine. Picked up the boarding pass at the airport via self service machine without any trouble. Boarding was efficient and quick. Plane (B777-300ER) left on time. I am not that big but leg (and knee) space was more than enough (considering it was economy). Enjoyed the IFE although I do believe the movie selection could have been better (however it changes monthly). Food was good and I must state that the fact that KLM constantly replaces the snacks on the back of the plane is very good: If you are ever thirsty or hungry you can always find a constantly renewed set of snacks and drinks at the back. I had a good short haul experience (B737-800). Leg space good and nice crew. Nice snacks were served there as well. I had the same experience on return and I must say that I considered KLM a great airline.

Vancouver-Amsterdam in Business Class. Overall a poor experience. Lounge shared with 5 Asian airlines looked dated not clean limited food/snacks on offer (instant noodle soup) dirty washrooms and cramped seating. Wifi OK. Boarding chaotic. Priority given to family with small children resulted in 40% of all pax moving forward. On board seating unacceptable as to be expected no lie-flat seats. Food and beverage service just acceptable. Not a fan of a Dutch Winter meal (hutspot) offered in mid-summer. Professional friendly Staff. Offering a non stop YVR-AMS service is a big plus. For me the only reason to choose KLM.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
CWL-AMS-CGK in Business Class: delayed out of Cardiff meant very tight connection in Amsterdam with no time for luggage to be loaded. I was offered a night in Amsterdam but couldn't opt for this due to business meetings in Jakarta soon after arrival. Bought a few clothes which I hope KLM will reimburse me for. Luggage delivered to my hotel room in Jakarta the following night. Service on Cityhopper F70 and B777 good and food reasonable. I thought movie choice a bit limited but music choice adequate. on AMS-KUL I thought the service was only average which was unusual for KLM in my opinion. Allowed to remain on board during brief stop in Kuala Lumpur. Looking forward to return flight in August and being able to fly into Cardiff a regional airport close to my home.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Booked and paid for our flights 8 months ahead. Arrived at airport 3 hours before our international flight - they said we were on standby because we didn't book our seats online 30 hours previous. We were on holiday and received no conditions when we booked about having to confirm online. We had connections so they probably had to put us on the flight but assured us we would be well compensated if they couldn't get us on the flight. These people were so rude and arrogant. They did put us on the flight (the one we booked and paid for 8 months out) and then somehow felt we should have been extremely grateful! Then the electronics didn't work the entire 12 hour flight so we got a voucher for 50 euro discount on our next booking. Never again.

YYZ-AMS-YYZ. The economy seats booked in February were changed. On the outbound flight my seat remained the same as booked but my wife's seat was changed to one somewhere else in the plane. We upgraded to two seats in comfort economy. On the return flight both of our seats which we had booked were changed to the row in the middle immediately behind the washroom. Trying to inquire about these changes was time consuming and useless.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Often fly KLM on Amsterdam - Vienna route either with 737-700's or Embraer 190's. For a limited amount (10-20 euro depending of your Flying Blue status) you can get a premium economy seat on the 737's resulting in 4 inch of extra space making the seat very comfortable. If you're lucky you even can get a seat with extra space in economy if business usage is limited and classes shift forward. Seats on the Embraer are fine as well mostly as it is a 2+2 layout. KLM staff are in general very friendly and often call me by name. Drinks service is ok always giving 2 drinks sometimes even an extra round. Snacks unfortunately are a shame often only providing a small bag of cookies. On the morning flights there is sometimes a sandwich but always the same (cheese spread). Also the lack of a newspaper is a pity. All together the flight and seats are fine the staff are friendly but catering is poor.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Vancouver to Oslo via Amsterdam in Economy Comfort. Aircraft B777-200. Very happy with KLM product. Excellent website where you can select your meal seat and even the person next to you if you use "Meet and Seat". Extra legroom in the Comfort zone and front of cabin with a friendly and enthusiastic steward. A drink with a nuts was served as an aperitif and the meal after that with another drink service. Meal was not large but tasty. Enormous movie and TV selection on personal screen without charge. Throughout the flight plenty of water was served a snack mid-flight and continental breakfast. Transfer at Amsterdam easy and pleasant Good signage nice cafe's and shops. Short flight to Oslo very good. KLM really have a consistent and pleasant economy product now which is excellent value. Transferring at Amsterdam Schiphol airport is much easier and nicer than Frankfurt or London. In my opinion and I fly 80 flights a year on many different airlines KLM really deserves its new 4-star status.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I was unable at the time of making my reservation to select a seat due to systems problems. I went to the site that advertises the option of seat selection and selected seats. I arrived at the airport and discovered my selected seats were not available and I was assigned a seat beside the washroom and behind infant row. My seat selection was also changed on the second leg of my journey. False advertising poor contact centre service and the seats are worse than other carriers. The food was really awful. The staff were the only positive attribute. If at all possible I will never fly KLM again.

HAM-AMS-BKK in June 2013. HAM-AMS on E195 aircraft 50 min. short Inter-European flight. Nothings expected and nothing to complain. Soft drink with cracker and nuts was served. Transit at 4 stars Schiphol-Airport was very easy. AMS-BKK on B777-300 flight on time Y Cabin full and with KLM’s with 3-4-3 seats config (like EK/EY/OS/AF) very narrow seats narrow aisle I felt like a sardine in the can. Cabin crews old but experienced professional polite and strongly enthusiastic throughout the flight. Info from cockpit came often IFE very goods with touch screen and 500 programs Dinner (2 choices) with extra 300ml bottle of water for every passenger. Presentation and quality of meals were standard Y Class. Duty free offers a lot of choices. During the flight crews came often with ice creams/ crackers and water. Before Landing continental breakfast was served. After Landing crews are still “ on enthusiasm service” with helping passenger with their handbags/ saying thank you and goodbye with smiles. For me KLM is a 4 Stars airline in Y class product.

Toronto to Amsterdam return. Flew on an A330 both ways. Cabin crew was excellent and the food and wine selection was good. The seat is not lie flat and I could not find a comfortable sleeping position. I did manage a couple hours in the recline position though. The cost of the ticket was about 30% less than similar itineraries I looked at before booking which may account for the different seat.

Amsterdam to Rio June 2013. First time traveling KLM and it was a very good experience. A hot meal served a couple of hours into the flight then mid-flight a hot snack was served. An hour prior to landing crew came around again with a choice of Ice Cream or Crisps. The presentation of the food looked a little bit cheap but the quality was good. Cabin crew were excellent. Every hour at least there were crew members in the cabin with a drinks tray offering water/juice etc. Inflight entertainment was good and the seat was comfortable. I would have no hesitation in using KLM again.

AMS-BCN. Unfortunately the service on this flight consisted (as usual) of a cheese sandwich. Now I don't like cheese so I skipped it. Nevertheless the crew managed to give me an alternative: sandwich with meat. Very good! The only disappointing thing about this flight was the lack of TV screens throughout the plane.

DXB-AMS-CGN return flight. Chaotic check-in at DXB airport. My reservation reference had been lost and ground staff were unable to retrieve it. I had to go down to the KLM airport office and resolve it. Crown Lounge is pitiful no food service no quiet zone no showers. Sky Priority boarding has been not respected we were all mixed. Aircraft operated was an old tired Airbus 330-200 we were packed like sardines and the temperature was extremely hot with no individual air setting. Seats awfully cramped. IFE was not working and was never reset. Light remained off during all flights (a night flight) no earplugs nor eye mask available. Food was a tiny cheese sandwich as a snack after take off and a "delicious" breakfast with only one option served by the most inefficient and rude crew I've seen. Return flight was similar: same equipment same food same rude cabin crew. Worse still is Schiphol Terminal: unhelpful ground staff. No way to access to the lounge even with a premium economy ticket. AMS-CGN flight delayed.

23rd June we were flying from Amsterdam to Los Angeles. Plane left 1 hour late the captain tried to explain but the sound system was so bad you could not hear what he was saying. The food was pretty bad. Inflight entertainment was outdated. Most of the crew were not interested in cleaning up after you. The crew came by once to pick up your empty meal container and let you sit with cups etc for the rest of the flight. The movie selection was good. We have used KLM for many years to fly to Holland but this will be our last trip with them.

BHX-AMS-PEK return code share with China Air. Have flown many times with BA Virgin Lufthansa Air New Zealand etc and KLM was by far the worst especially the legs operated by their code share partner (not necessarily KLM's fault but when buying tickets through an airline you expect equivalent level of service throughout). Meals and refreshments were awful IFE most rudimentary and other passengers allowed to ignore safety rules such as cabin baggage limits and seat positions for takeoff and landing. Could not discourage using KLM strongly enough.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Manchester - Amsterdam - Buenos Aires. Economy class. KLM were the cheapest and had the most convenient flight times. All flights more or less on time. Transfers at Schipol were effortless and smooth. In terms of inflight service I found it to be more than acceptable. Seat backs were a bit hard but overall 13+ hours in their seats did not feel unbearable at all. IFE was good but the outdated screens could do with an overhaul (777-200). I found the service to be good. The flight attendants were always visible and very attentive. They keep you well stocked up with food and drink during the flights. Yes attendants can be quite terse at times but this was mainly due to passengers ignoring the command to put their seatbelts on during times of turbulence. Elected to upgrade to Economy Comfort on EZE-AMS return leg in order to attempt up get some sleep and to be one of the first to disembark the plane due to a short connection time (45 minutes) and it was worth it. Overall my experience was good and I would fly with KLM on a long haul trip again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I'm elite member Flying Blue and fly to Rio de Janeiro from 4 to 5 times a year. I have determined that the value of the trip will depends very much on the cabin crew who are just on the flight. On my second last flight KLM 705 on April 10 the cabin crew were excellent whereupon KLM 705 June 16 cabin staff were of a very low level. Some staff will do everything so the guest will enjoy the journey while another crew sees the guest mostly as a distraction to their work. Aircraft's are ok but no more a major upgrade is necessary but what really makes the experience of KLM worthy as a choice is cabin crew. When you then met with such a low level that the recent trip was to the re-election of airlines to be something relevant.

I flew twice with KLM from Hamburg to Cape Town via Amsterdam. First time the return flight to Hamburg was delayed and we were stuck in Amsterdam for 10 hours without any service (not even a cup of tea) or information. The 2nd time I flew with KLM was the first time I have ever got hungry on a flight: between 6am and 2pm we only got one dry cookie on the flight to Amsterdam and a small bag of nuts on the following flight to Cape Town. First real meal was at 2 pm! On the flight back breakfast and the first hot beverages came at 11.30am (time of departure location) which is really late when you are awake since 5am.

YUL-AMS-MUC return C class. KLM is a very good product cabin crew are always smiling and providing excellent service much better than other 4 star airlines. They still fly the MD11 plane on the Montreal-Amsterdam route which I like flying but Business configuration is a retro concept with non flat bed oldish screens ageing cabin. Air France-KLM lounge in YUL is a joke in AMS is great a lot of services variety of food fast wifi comfortable coaches nice view etc. Inflight meals were OK nothing gourmet but still above the average point excellent wine selection. The only negative comment on my way back from Munich to Amsterdam the crew thought I was a non-rev KLM staff employee not allowed to get meals or refreshments due to incorrect info from the ground staff at the airport. The crew apologised and served me a different meal still good quality.

The Japanese meal selections were very tasty and large in portions.

Flew with KLM to Israel with a connection in Amsterdam both ways so 4 flights. Shorter flights (UK to Amsterdam) were more relaxing than the long ones. Staff were reasonably helpful however before a 4 hour flight took off I was moved twice. They moved me to a reserved seat for cabin crew which nobody sat in. They then moved me again. The food wasn't great but I wasn't expecting much. I won't be flying KLM again.

AMS-BKK-AMS / KL875 and KL876. Travel dates 18 May 2013 23 May 2013. KLM is in the range of 4 stars airlines: smooth logistics pristine fleet very comprehensive website and product one of the few to offer Economy Comfort between Europe and Asia (with post booking online purchase) ultra efficient staff on board not to mention the transit hub of Schiphol making it a pleasure to travel. The only dark points is the stiffness of seat cushions not enough to outshine the rest. All the years I flew them never had a delay or cancellation (unlike other skyteam members). Would gladly see them upgraded one notch.

Got a bargain sub-100EUR price for my return trip from Amsterdam-Hamburg. Absolutely brilliant experience including the price. Flight was less than an hour and without fault. Snacks and drinks still served. One leg was in an old tired 747 but I was surprised by the KLM Cityhopper serviced by a light airy and modern Embraer that was perfect for this short hop. Would fly with again particularly at those prices.

Manston UK - Amsterdam - Bangkok. I am more than happy with KLM. They have started to fly from Manston UK which means no more trailing over to Heathrow. The service was excellent my a la carte meal delicious and the seats were comfortable. I will be flying with them again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Came last night from Amsterdam to Panama. (May 31 2013). Service is excellent at airports and onboard. Inflight they are always prepared to help. Cabin crew are committed to making your flight pleasant! The food is delicious. The old planes they were using for this route were too old now with the 777 I felt much better. I recommend that since this is a very long flight that they use their best aircraft's on this route. I also took KLM flights within Europe and had the same good experience.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
BKK-AMS-BRU / MRS-AMS-BKK. Long haul leg from BKK to AMS was fine. Paid the extra for a bulk-head seat so no complaints regarding legroom there. Plane appeared to be an early generation 777-200 as the cabin was looking a bit dated and seats a bit worn. Plane was clean though. Food was decent though nothing to rave about. Arrived in AMS and checked the board for my transfer to BRU and all appeared in order. I get to the gate just in time to find out my connecting flight got cancelled because the plane had no crew. KLM offered to bus the passengers on the flight to BRU but I made my own way. KLM provided the usual voucher and an apology. Return flight from MRS to BKK via AMS was fine. On the AMS-BKK leg I was on the same 777-200 but bought the premium economy for this leg hoping to be able to get some sleep. Seat I selected lacked legroom because the seat in front of me had the equipment box underneath it so I had to sit at an angle to stretch my legs. With the exception of getting off the plane first there is little point in buying premium economy. IFE system was seriously dated. Small screen with visual static (it was visible on all the other screens I saw). Hopefully KLM upgrades these when the plane goes through its next D-check. Overall experience wasn't bad but the European carriers need to step it up when the Gulf and Asian carriers offer a superior experience at the same relative cost.

JHB-YYZ on June 1st 2013. Gold level with Flying Blue and recently took the JHB to YYZ via AMS overnight flight. Trip started fine with 'outsourced’ check-in so no KLM employees in sight just local ground agents. They helpfully got me 2 luggage locks from Emirates. Air France/KLM Lounge is a disaster. Naff 80's styled furniture which is past its prime. Lounge is outsourced and is not clean. Once white chairs are now black red carpet is fraying. Welcome desk is staffed by 2 uninterested employees who spend more time on their mobile phones. The food amounts to pre-packaged sandwiches. Onboard things get better. It is best to describe KLM service as stiff with a smile. I had the express meal option which was good and they quickly plated the main meal within 60 min from take off. Wine list is excellent and they serve very good champagne. I won't deal with the seats because we all know they are being changed to the new sleeper style (well new to KLM about 10 years behind the industry). Lounge in AMS is excellent with lots of services. All in all a fine experience.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
JFK-AMS-TLV. First leg old 747-400 with newer seats including personal screen. Seats hard pitch acceptable as we where sitting in premium economy. Staff friendly and polite food as usual tasteless to bad. Second flight 737-800 uneventful. Seats typical economy seats from European airlines. No personal TV screen no movie as no main screens. Food same issue again as usual. Crew very good and several water and juice runs after dinner. Good airline and if they would improve food quality I would fly them more.

Amsterdam to Panama Panama to Amsterdam. I am a long timer KLM user but these were my worst long haul flights for many years. Boeing 777 both ways uncomfortable seats poor seat pitch so very cramped. When the seat in front reclines it is not possible to view the seat back screen. Food is adequate airline crew do what they have to. How far KLM have fallen.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
MUC-AMS-SFO-AMS-MUC. Check-in in MUC and SFO smooth first SFO flight 3 hours delayed due to technical problems (plane change) plane (MD11) old but in very good shape and clean. I'm quite tall but leg room was sufficient. Crew friendly and helpful good information from the cockpit. Food was good enough drinks and snacks between the main meals. In the end we arrived only 2 hours later in SFO. And we get a "sightseeing" round over the Golden Gate Bridge for the delay. Return flight was a B747-400 also well kept and a helpful crew. AVOD is relatively tiny screens with a poor resolution but a good movie and music selection. Overall pleasant experience if the price is ok I'll fly them again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Schiphol to St Petersburg and return in April and May. When we arrived the previously-arranged assistance was there with a young man putting us immediately on the buggy and taking us to collect luggage and out to the station at the back. Could not have asked for better service. On the return trip passenger assistance did not want to know about us. KLM staff in Moscow messed up the luggage and told us they couldn't send it from Moscow all the way through to Brisbane so we had to find it at Schiphol with an 18-hour lay-over and manage it ourselves. One staff member took pity on us and checked our luggage in overnight. Had to beg to have use of the buggy to get to China Southern for departure back to China en route to Brisbane. Although all of this was booked from Brisbane and re-checked all along the way and we had such a good feeling about KLM we felt the attitude of most of the staff was brusque and not helpful. We can see passenger assistance is available but we had to fight for it! We will never fly KLM again and will pay more to get the service with a smile.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew MNL-AMS-MAD / BCN-AMS-MNL. The stewardess / steward just do what they need to do and seems that they do not care about the service they're giving. Food is horrible its so expensive. Seat pitch is okay but on their long- haul 777's legroom is not enough.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Istanbul-Amsterdam-Dusseldorf. We checked in quickly at the airport using the machines and bag drop. Our first leg was on a B737. Due to runway congestion at Amsterdam the flight left 15 mins late but arrived on time. The extra 30€ we paid for a premium economy seat was well worth it for the extra space. A large but bland breakfast was served. Our second leg was on an F70. The plane developed a technical fault at the gate. Another plane was ready and loaded for departure within 30 mins. A comfortable short flight with a juice and biscuit served. Both the crews were friendly.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Singapore - Cardiff yesterday in Business Class was a good experience all the way home after a couple of weeks working in the area. The long-haul B-777 had a very good cabin crew on board with excellent service and every little request handled promptly and efficiently. Departure was slightly behind schedule but the arrival was on time if not a bit earlier. No flat-beds but I seldom go full flat on seats with this function and still slept well. The lounge in Singapore was of poor quality compared to others e.g. Emirates in Kuala Lumpur or even the shared lounge used by KLM in Cardiff. The short haul flight across to Cardiff was equally as good.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I have used KLM several times now and reasonably pleased with the service provided. The entertainment system has a long list of good movies and seat comfort is good even with my glass back though it could improve with the addition of a foot rest. An extra tour with the beverage trolley would be nice on long-haul flights but you can always buzz if necessary. Planes are always clean and tidy. Cabin staff are pleasant. But the best part about KLM? Using Schipol Airport.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-SFO-AMS-SFO. Both good and on time. We paid extra for extra leg room seats in Economy. Nice lot of leg room - but I am glad my hips were not too wide as they are tight! The reason for this is the sides are rigid as they have the IFE screen and meal table included. So whilst the leg room is super the width is not so take that into consideration! FA's were nice on both flights-can sometimes be a little direct on other flights (some would say rude) but that is the Dutch way and not meant to be offensive - but can leave you a bit cross sometimes! On the whole a good experience for a long haul flight.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Cardiff - Singapore: May 10th/11th - Business Class. For various reasons I was unable to book this flight until the day of travel so it was an expensive flight but my phone reservation was handled promptly and efficiently. Check in at Cardiff was smooth and the lounge offered a selection of Welsh drinks. There was priority boarding onto the old F-70 which was not full and only 2 in business class. The aircraft looked like it had recently been refurbished. A smooth but short transfer at Schipol into 1J on B777-300ER where pre-take off drinks were offered. The whole flight was good although my AV didn't work for the first two hours. It was my birthday the next morning so I was woken with a champagne breakfast. Great crew.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-BKK. I have flown this route multiple times and with a few exceptions I find the flight KLM crew rather rude and disinterested. On the website (when I bought the ticket) I had ordered a child's meal for my 10-year old and this had not come through. The flight attendant rebuffed me by a range of arguments ranging from "you should ask at the check-in counter" to "he is too old for a child's meal". None of which answered my simple question how and why my request had not come through. IFE did not work properly. Generally seats are small but IFE screens are too small. The whole experience (this one and previous ones) shows KLM is not interested in the passenger/customer at all. It seems for KLM crew the passenger is merely an obstacle to a good salary and lots of free time in exotic locations than a purpose to serve.

AMS-CPT-AMS. All in all a good flight. Friendly flight attendants good food and onboard entertainment.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
LHR-AMS on April 27th. KLM staff were able to check our luggage all the way to Sydney even though we were changing airlines in Amsterdam and travelling via Bangkok with a long stop over in Taipei. Paid extra for extra leg room seats. $25 well spent. FA's very friendly. Offered a large Cheese Sandwich with drinks for the short 45 minute flight. Didn't use inflight entertainment.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-WAW with the B737-800 "Swan". Boarding started on time and went pretty flawless. After takeoff everybody received a fresh chicken sandwich which was pretty good. Drinks service was also decent staff were friendly and polite. Flight was uneventful and well before scheduled arrival time we arrived at Warsaw. Overall a pretty good performance seats were comfortable enough no inflight entertainment but for a 1.5 hrs flight it's no big deal.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
WAW-AMS-MAN return flights on time comfortable B737s. As a Flying Blue Gold card holder 3 times out of 4 I was approached personally by Purser and offered Economy Extra seat. Generally cabin service is the same as other European airlines but cabin crew were helpful friendly and professional (except the last sector AMS-WAW while despite almost empty flight cabin crew responsible for recognizing top customers didn't do anything).

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
BRU-KUL return. KLM service was top notch both ways. Flight attendants were very attentive and friendly they handled a few difficult and demanding passengers professionally. Food was okay. AVOD was okay but dated no touch screen and limited selection movies compared to other airlines. Missed my flight from AMS to BRU due to the short connecting time ground staff was excellent and helpful they put me on the next train to BRU. On top of that I have also received 50 euro discount coupon for next flight with them 10 euro meal voucher and phone voucher. Seat pitch was good I am 180 cm. Good value for money airline overall.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Thoroughly enjoyed SIN to Denpasar and return trip. Staff excellent in Business class. You will often find great prices on this sector as plane comes through from AMS. Have flown KLM a number of times to Europe through AMS and have found it well priced with good service.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
I flew KLM to Amsterdam-Havana-Amsterdam. The seats are good most of the food is very good. The tickets were cheap. The entertainment system has a big choice but is a bit old and small. The cabin attendants were smiling professional and came around frequently with drinks.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
MAN-AMS 19 April. Flight departed MAN almost 2 hours late due to late inbound arrival should have had 2.5 hrs to connect at AMS but by the time we deplaned had just 40 minutes to get from one end of Schipol to the other. My onward flight had already boarded but was waiting for the 3 passengers from the MAN delayed flight  otherwise it would have meant staying in AMS overnight. Food on board was awful (a piece of cake and a very weak coffee).

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Whilst the service was reasonably good I have never sat in such uncomfortable seats. The 11 hour 20 minute flight from Osaka to Amsterdam on a Boeing 777 was the most uncomfortable I've ever been. The problem wasn't the leg room which was similar to most economy cabins it was the width of the seat and the actual comfort of the seat - it's the first flight where I've experienced backache. When I transferred in Amsterdam to a KLM Fokker 70 to fly back to Leeds it was bliss the economy seats were like padded armchairs. I've made a mental note never to fly in a 777 again unless there's absolutely no choice and the journey is of extreme importance.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Flew Detroit-Amsterdam-Valencia returning via Valencia-Amsterdam-Atlanta from April 3-8. Flight over was Delta Airbus with Delta crew did not offer Economy Class seating. Overall good service food entertainment system. Return trip from Amsterdam to Atlanta was on what I'm guessing was a new KLM A330 aircraft with Economy Class seating and was exceptional in every aspect. The KLM staff are some of the best you will find. The food and drink kept on coming and was very good. Inflight entertainment did have to be re-booted once as some passengers screens stopped working but was only a minor inconvenience for those of us without the problem. My first time booking with KLM and I will certainly fly them again.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
March 15th and 26th Canada - Amsterdam - Germany and return. Staff kind and attentive many smiles and polite at all times. The food offered is below standard. I'm not picky when it comes to airline food but even I was not able to enjoy any of it. All the food served was cold or undercooked. Other than that very smooth flights.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Just returned from a round trip - Cairo to Calgary via Amsterdam. This was my first time on KLM and I must say that I was impressed. The crew worked hard on all flights and we were well fed and there were regular juice/water runs. On the Amsterdam to Calgary sector there were additional snacks and drinks available in the galley. Crew were friendly smiling and very accommodating not something that you always see these days on European airlines. The only thing I would say that could be improved is the selection of films/tv programmes on the inflight entertainment. Overall though a very good trip.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
YYZ to AMS. In general the aircraft is very dated and the seats are among the worst I have experienced in recent history most major airlines replaced this style of seats years ago.

AMS-SIN-AMS. Flights were very good. Both Flights on schedule. Flight attendants were friendly and service focused. Seat is fine leg room substantial. Good value for money. In my opinion KLM is a 4 star airline.

Flew MME via AMS to NRT return. Outbound flight from Durham Tees Valley delayed by 20 minute because of snow storm still arrived plenty of time to catch my connection nice snack and drink service for this 50 minute flight. Amsterdam to Narita good service and FA's food good. Return delayed in Narita due to technical problem by 2 hours FA's good and very forthcoming with information about my connection flight good food decent. On arrival in Amsterdam missed my connection was booked onto the next flight given £20 for food and drink 50 euros off my next flight free phone voucher so I could contact home and free shower voucher to use with the mercury hotel. Overall even with the delay could not fault KLM's customer service.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Washington Dulles via Amsterdam to Nairobi. The service was very competent and friendly. We had a mechanical problem with the aircraft from AMS-NBO which caused a significant delay. KLM did an excellent job communicating with passengers finding a new plane and calling in a new crew. Fortunately I was able to use the lounge but had friends in economy and they were all pleased with the service.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Amsterdam-Barcelona and back. Really nice service friendly staff. The connection was not very cheap but it was worth the money. On the return flight the food wasn't quite tasty but that's not so bad. If you don't have to have all the free food and stuff it's better to just fly a Low-Cost airline. I recommend this airline!

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
PBM-AMS 747-400. Seats in row 64 and 65. Late departure due to sloppy work at embarkation not to blame the airline. Bumpy flight due to turbulence again not to blame the airline. Entertainment system is OK though there is a lack of choices when flying regular with KLM. Seats are diminutive for me (being 6 ft 5). Food and beverages are good. Staff is very friendly and professional.

Flight 429 Amsterdam to Dubai 22/03/2013 dep 22.05 arr 07.30. Seat 8J economy comfort. All in all a pleasant journey with friendly and efficient crew marvellous (old) plane delicious dinner after departure and cocktail service and snack short before landing. The recline in economy comfort is helpful to relax and worth the 100 EUR extra for it. The seat is situated in the quieter part of the MD-11. The MD-11 is very roomy. A pity the aircraft will soon leave the fleet. The entertainment is a bit old and the screens small.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Warsaw - Incheon and back. Everything was so-so but the entertainment system was awful. I'm a music and movie lover so was quite dissatisfied to see such a poor selection to choose from. Also the airplanes were not the cleanest I've seen. Positive were the comfortable seats in Economy class I could even stretch out.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
A pretty good flight last year (July 2012) from Amsterdam to Narita. Excellent in-flight entertainment - not a lot of movies in French and no French introduction in general (which is pretty normal). I had problems with my headphones at the beginning of the flight I called for a stewardess. She came 30 mins after I called her with new headphones 10 minutes later. The seat pitch was not very comfortable for me. In conclusion KLM is a pretty good airline. This flight was better than my flight Paris-Tokyo on Air France.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
Economy from CPH-AMS-SIN on Fokker 70 and B777. CPH-AMS good short flight on time and with a little snack. FA very friendly. AMS-SIN slightly delayed departure and arrival into Singapore but explained and kept informed. FA very friendly and with frequent drink patrols. Food was among better I have ever had in economy. Toilets kept clean. I didn't use IFE that much but seemed responsive and good with average content. The seats was really good. Slightly on the hard side and a footrest would have been appreciated. But compared to other airlines like Air France these seats feel vastly superior. Legroom also more than acceptable. In summary a really good airline that I would use without hesitation.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
KUL to Amsterdam and return. Both ways very old aircraft. Poor food. On the return journey we were getting hungry waiting for the dinner service. Finally I asked the Purser when the dinner was coming to which she said it isn't! There is only one meal she said which was served at lunch time. For a ten hour flight we felt this was miserable.

Flew Manchester UK to Accra Ghana economy comfort. I flew economy comfort as a treat the service by the staff was excellent.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-BON (Bonaire). Very pleasantly surprised. First time with KLM and I did not expect much of the KLM economy product but it was an excellent flight. Fairly recent A330-300. Seats 2-4-2 - row 17 on the wings very quiet. Cabin could have been cleaner. Service excellent - Crew attentive and passing regularly with drinks. All requests executed with good attitude. Main meal Ice cream and evening pizza all very good for economy. Drink choice correct. Entertainment system easy to use with good and recent movies. On-time flight (incl the stop in Aruba). Definitely 4* airline.

Flew Business Class AMS-DEL as part of a DL itinerary on a 747-400. Overall excellent service and food. The cabin though is horribly dated. KL just announced an update starting this summer but it is seriously overdue. The decor seemed very 1980's to me. I haven't flown KL for a while and was delighted they are still distributing the delft Dutch houses. A very nice touch. Great professional in-flight staff.

### KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review
AMS-SIN the food was inedible breakfast was as poor. Non working IFE. I was travelling with my son and wife and one IFE was broken while the other one would not respond to the remote control. KLM is the worst choice on Europe-Asia route.
