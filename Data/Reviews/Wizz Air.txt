### advise against using this company"
I strongly advise against using this company. It’s nearly impossible to reach a live customer service representative by phone, and communication overall is extremely difficult. They also tend to add unexpected charges if you're not paying close attention. We booked a flight from Barcelona to Rome through them and purchased two tickets—one with a 20kg luggage allowance and the other with 26kg. Both suitcases were identical in size. We redistributed our items so that one bag weighed exactly 20kg and the other 24kg. In a rush at the airport and without Wi-Fi access, I didn’t double-check the baggage allowances on our tickets. At check-in, we were charged 60 euros for the second bag supposedly being 4kg over the 20kg limit. After passing security and finally connecting to Wi-Fi, I reviewed our tickets and confirmed that the second bag was actually allowed 26kg. I  ran back to the check-in desk. The agent acknowledged the mistake and admitted we were wrongly charged, but said the only way to get a refund was by submitting a claim online. Since returning home, I’ve tried repeatedly to reach someone to resolve the issue, there is no live customer service. I submitted all the necessary documentation by email, and their response was baffling: they rejected my claim, stating the luggage was "oversized. How does that make sense? Both bags were exactly the same size. If the 20kg bag was accepted without issue, how could the identical 24kg bag suddenly be "oversized"? This company lacks common sense and customer support. I strongly urge others to avoid booking with them.

### "did not fit into their metal frame"
Not Verified |  24.04.2025 in Sibiu our 40x30x20 small luggage was rejected as it somehow did not fit into their metal frame, because of the wheels, and we were forced to pay 73€ to be allowed on board. Another passenger could not (or did not want to) pay for his “over-sized” backpack and missed the flight as a result. Same trip – our 20kg checked luggage had an extra 800g of weight, for which they wanted us to pay 20-some more €. I know, technically they were right, but ethically come on.

### "offers the worst legroom"
Wizz Air’s economy class offers the worst legroom I’ve encountered - rows are so tight my knees press painfully into the seat ahead, making a short flight unbearable. Overhead bin space is routinely exhausted before boarding ends, yet staff refuse to assist despite reserved seats, forcing passengers to pay €15-30 for priority boarding just to secure luggage space. The airline’s model prioritizes fees over basic comfort: extra legroom seats (€20-50) are a necessity for tall passengers. Fares have surged  while service quality plummets, cabin cleanliness is inconsistent, and customer service dismisses complaints about space or delays. Avoid Wizz Air unless discomfort and hidden fees are acceptable trade-offs for rock-bottom fares.

### "Extremely unprofessional cabin crew"
Extremely unprofessional cabin crew - engaged in loud conversations and laughter throughout the entire flight, showing no regard for the late hour or the passengers’ need to rest, especially after a one-hour delay. The lack of respect, empathy, and professionalism was disappointing.

### "size was 2-3cm above the regulated one"
I am never using this company again. The prices are relatively low but they are out to get you every way they can. The airport staff was hassling passengers about the size of their handheld luggage. The size was 2-3cm above the regulated one and they would not let us board. Many of us ended up paying twice our ticket price to be able to get in. I am very disappointed and I won't fly with this company ever again.

### "simple and efficient flight"
Nice experience, new modern aircraft. Flight slightly delayed due to weather condition (20 minutes). Cabin crew polite and friendly. No service on-board, just simple and efficient flight.

### "Would never use again"
Low budget airline at the cost of high end airline because of all the hidden charges and forced unfair fines. In my case was unable to checkin due to booking not being available on their system but despite their own staff not being able to retrieve it I was forced to pay significant fine or miss the flight. Raised complaint providing evidence, but it was just completely ignored. Once this and the other hidden charges were paid it ended up being more expensive than other much better airlines but just seemed cheaper upfront because of hiding the costs. Would never use again.

### "saw that my backpack would not fit"
We have flown from UK to Poland - round trip with my wife. We did not purchase so called "priority" as we did not have bigger onboard luggage. We both had small back packs and personal travel purses (small). Outbound - no problems - service as designed and expected. Inbound - when in the que to the gate for non-priority boarding we suddenly became a target for member of Wizzair staff. The staff announced to my wife that she needs to pack her small travel purse to the hand luggage otherwise it will cost us 309PLN (£60). Then it came same announcement for me. We had to step out from the que to pack small purses to backpacks. After we did that my wife was free to be scanned but it came backpack challenge for me. It was a request to squeeze my back pack to size tester standing by. I saw that my backpack would not fit so I asked directly to proceed for required payment. The presented a manually written  bill and produced printed receipt after presenting credit card machine to me. During all that time most of the que were scanned in without any luggage checks. During the incident my wife has pointed out the fact that we had flown in few days ago with identical hand luggage with no issues. The staff barked back about "other" members of Wizzair not doing their job correctly when SHE did, dismissing my wife's comment and fact of inconsistency of Wizzair onboarding procedures.

### "No explanations, no reasons"
Not Verified |  Having bought the ticket Abu Dhabi-Muscat several weeks in advance, very few days before departing I received an e-mail about the flight cancellation. No explanations, no reasons, just a notice. I had to combine that flight with another from Muscat to Buenos Aires, so I had a very hard time searching for a new flight the same day and similar time. Fortunately, I found one with Etihad (paying four times the original Wizz ticket). Many people told me about Wizz policy: they sell very cheap tickets to make a cancellation. The company refunded me the original price after a couple of weeks, but the inconvenience and bad time is not compensated with money.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Horrendous, lying, disgraceful company who have lied for nine months about cost reimbursement after they cancelled the flight. Avoid at all costs. They should be shut down.

### "frustrating and absurd experience"
I recently flew with Wizz & had the most frustrating and absurd experience with their ground staff at Budapest Airport. It all started when we were asked to pay an outrageous 73 Euros for 4 chocolate boxes we had purchased from the duty-free shop. These chocolates were completely within the limits of any reasonable baggage allowance, yet somehow, the staff insisted we pay this absurd extra charge. To make matters worse, when we tried to explain, they were completely unhelpful, dismissive, and rude. The attitude was infuriating, as though they were intentionally trying to make the situation as difficult and stressful as possible. Despite telling them we are Muslim They made us THROW AWAY FOOD that we had brought with us to open and eat on the flight. We had fruits and water also bought from cafes in duty free, but according to them, it was a problem. I’ve never had an airline staff act so recklessly and without any regard for passengers' needs. It felt like they were looking for any excuse to charge extra or inconvenience passengers, and I’ll never fly with Wizz Air again. It’s one thing to enforce policies, but to do so in such a hostile & unreasonable manner is beyond comprehension. Better avoid flying with them if you value your time, money, and sanity.

### "plane was not comfortable"
Not Verified |  I was flying from Bucharest to Catania with not a good experience with a lady at the gate with someone else. The flight was delayed for 2 hours with us in the heat, more stressing, just saying delayed on the screen. Then finally we boarded and 1 more hour in the plane with the deicing and taxiing. Finally we took off and in the air on our way to Catania. The plane was not comfortable and the food disgusting. Wizz air, you may do better.

### "€48 euros if i didn't check in"
Not Verified |  I was charged €48 by wizz air for not checking in online, even though i was at the baggage check in as soon as it opened 2.5 hrs before the flight time. I got an email the day before saying check in online, but it didn't tell me I'd have to pay €48 euros if i didn't check in. Huge slap in the face.

### “Don’t let the cheap flights fool you”
Not Verified | I had one of the WORST flight experiences I have ever had. Don’t let the cheap flights fool you. If you don’t purchase a seat on the plan and go for random seat select, there is NO GURANTEE you will get on your flight. Also the people I had to deal with, the attitude and rudeness was next level, they won’t listen to you, don’t help you when you’re in need. I don’t know how they sleep at knowing they work for Wizz air, and how they constantly let passengers down. The complaints centre is a waste of space, I would get more help from talking to a brick wall. I tell EVERYONE I know never, ever, ever fly with Wizz Air, even if it is saving you £20/40, it’s not worth, ANY other airline you will be guaranteed a seat on the plane, but not Wizz air.

### "Absolute scandal"
Was unfortunate to drop my custom made hearing aid costing 7500 Euros in the seat. Seat 1C. The hearing aid is in the seat frame, all they have to do is take out the bag with the life-vest, retrieve the hearing aid, and that's it. They refuse to do so, have just sent me a lot of paragraphs that I myself am responsible for my belongings. I know that, this was an unfortunate incident, and since they are to stubborn to just take it out I will now have to purchase a new one, go through all the procedures to have it fitted. Absolute scandal.

### "duplicate charges on luggage"
I see that I am not alone here having been a Wizz Air passenger with duplicate charges on luggage. Flying with Wizz was like experiencing the lower reaches of hell: cramped space, filthy conditions on board, miserable service attendants at the gate, and to top it off they charge you twice for services. How are they able to get away with scamming passengers like that?

### “Another bad experience”
Not Verified | Another bad experience with Wizzair, but for sure the last. First they moved the schedule from 7 pm to 5.30 am. We bought this trip due to the nice schedule. The day before departure, we tried to check in online, but that was not possible, got a msg, internet check in is not available. We tried their chat, not working. We tried to call but endless lines. When we showed up early in the morning ending up in line for check in, it’s possible the clerk did not speak english, but we were sent to another line, there we had to pay 220 zloty pr person, cause we had not checked in online. Then back again, this time we got the boarding cards. We went in among the last ones, no space for the luggage. We heard the attendants tell us passengers just to put trolleys in the overhead bin. Nobody listened, small bags jackets, everything. The plane left half an hour late, not Wizz Air’s fault though, had to deice. But we have learned one thing, never ever Wizzair.

### "charge you for everything they can"
Do not fly with this company! They will charge you for everything they can. From Lisbon to Warsaw they've stopped people to demand money from luggage, from Warsaw to Lisbon, I've paid on the website but then they charged me on the airport! Other than that, on the flight itself, any request was ignored. Never again! Even RyanAir is still better than WizzAir.

### "A very bad experience"
We got a message In the morning, where we were informed that the plane was delayed 1.5 hours, so we went later to the airport. Two more delays came up, it ended up with nearly 4.5 hours late. The normal chaos inside, with people try to get all their luggage stowed away. When we started our decent, the captain informed us that Krakow airport was closed, and we had to land in Katowice. Outside Katowice airport we did not find one single representative from Wizzair. A lot of busses were lined up, but no signs on them, we tried to ask people that was on the same plane , and could speak polish, what was hoing on. Nobody knew. The busses was not for us, but Ryanair passengers. So we ended up with a taxi to Krakow, cause we gave up to find a bus. A very bad experience with Wizzair, all about their customer service is bad, started already from online check in and onward. Its many years since we travelled with Wizzair, and for sure there will be many years to the next.

### "When things go wrong, WizzAir do not care"
Not Verified | We flew from Vienna to Gatwick and due to Storm Darragh, circled in the air for an hour before landing. Landing was attempted but aborted due to strong winds and we were diverted to Cologne, Germany. Here we sat on the tarmac for 2 hours with minimal information and were still required to pay for water! We were eventually told we were flying back to Vienna. Some passengers chose to get off at Cologne but were told they would not receive compensation if they did. We then took an hours flight back to Vienna. On arrival we were told that ground staff in the airport would rebook our flights and arrange accommodation if needed, and not to do so ourselves or we wouldn't be eligible for compensation. However, we were well and truly DUMPED. We were sent through a side gate of the airport completely bypassing passport control. After collecting baggage and having no idea what to do, a staff member told us to go to arrivals and someone would be with us shortly. 2 HOURS later with no sign of any staff, police show up. Turns out us UK citizens are technically there illegally due to going through the side gate. Once the police had dealt with this, we waited a further 3-4 hours with no food or drink until the airport opened again and staff arrived. Here we were told they couldn't do anything and to book flights and hotels ourselves. To dump 250 passengers in a closed airport with no information, no drinks, no seats or anything was truly DISGUSTING. We are now all fighting for refunds and compensation and struggling to get anywhere. When things go wrong, WizzAir do not care at all about their passengers!

### "bag size restrictions are crazy"
They deliberately puts all seats away as far as they can. Bad service at the airport and on flight too. The bag size restrictions are crazy and pointless. Avoid if you can. They try to get all the money from you as much as they can.

### "not able to check in online"
Worse company and my Worse experience. As many people I couldn't Check-in online, I was traveling with my sister. When we arrived at the airport, attendant told me I have to pay 45 euros for the seats, and she says nobody guarantees we will have seats. They put us on standby Of course that was a game, at the end there were few extra seats. At the way back I experienced same issue, not able to check in online.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Only one word. Terrible experience. Avoid this airline to save your nerves , time it is not worth the money. Do not save on your comfort it will ruin your trip and your traveling experience

### "unceremoniously rescheduled the flight"
After more than eight hours aboard a stuffed plane they finally cancelled the flight, even though up to that moment they kept announcing every time and again that we would shortly. At first they made passengers pay for refreshments, later we got a small cup of water and a minuscule bar of chocolate. They promised us assistance after disembarking but no one showed up. They unceremoniously rescheduled the flight with making no announcement whatsoever, we just saw it show up on the screens. No assistance, no hotel room, no reimbursements were offered.

### "very incompetent company"
Outbound flight was delayed by 2 hours due to fog, this was only indicated just before we were to drive to the departure point on the plane. Return flight delayed by 45 minutes because the departure point was apparently occupied, this was indicated at the same point. They will send you an email that you have to be at the airport 3 hours in advance, but they inform customers earlier about a possible explanation, whatever. In 2019 I went to Budapest. On the return flight, nothing seemed to be wrong, until we spent 1 second with the wheel on the ground at Eindhoven Airport and the pilot thought, no, I can't do this. I find it absurd that they have undergone extensive training for this and that a baby can communicate even better. We finally landed in Cologne and took the bus back to Eindhoven Airport. In total we were 3 hours later and during that time we only received a sandwich with 1 slice of cheese and 1 bottle of water. The whole evening was ruined, completely exhausted by hunger. The difference in price in many countries is so large that I occasionally take the risk of flying via Wizz Air. In these expensive times it is impossible to always fly with companies such as KLM for a city trip. From now on I think I'll just book an extra day to avoid possible delays from this very incompetent company. Heen vlucht 2 uur vertraging door mist, dit werd pas aangegeven net voordat we naar het vertrekpunt zouden rijden in het vliegtuig. Terug vlucht 45 minuten vertraging omdat het vertrekpunt blijkbaar bezet was, dit werd op hetzelfde punt aangegeven. Ze sturen je wel leuk een mail dat je 3 uur van tevoren op het vliegveld aanwezig moet zijn, maar klanten eerder op de hoogte stellen over mogelijke verklaring, ho maar. In 2019 ben ik naar Boedapest geweest. Terugvlucht leek er niks aan de hand te zijn, totdat we 1 seconde met het wieletje op de grond van Eindhoven Airport waren en de piloot dacht, nee dit kan ik toch niet. Vind het absurd dat ze een hele opleiding daarvoor hebben gevolgd en een baby nog beter kan communiceren. We waren uiteindelijk geland in Keulen, zijn met de bus terug naar Eindhoven Airport gegaan. In totaal waren we 3 uur later en in die tijd hebben we alleen een boterham met 1 plakje kaas en 1 flesje water gekregen. Hele avond verpest, was helemaal kapot door de honger. Het is dat bij veel landen het verschil erg groot is qua prijs dat ik af en toe het risico aan durf om via Wizz Air te vliegen. In deze dure tijden is het onmogelijk om steeds met maatschappijen zoals KLM te vliegen voor een stedentrip. Ik denk vanaf nu dat ik gewoon een hele dag extra ga boeken voor mogelijke vertraging van dit zwaar incapabel bedrijf.

### "a violation of trust"
Not Verified |  I paid €349.99 on 29th Sept 2024 for a full-year premium membership that was supposed to run until 29th Sept 2025. Despite receiving confirmation that my membership was active, I still cannot use it. For over a week, I’ve been passed around with excuses about “technical issues,” without any real resolution or compensation offered. Each time I reach out, customer service gives vague responses, suggesting it’s “being handled by IT.” Charging customers for a service and not delivering it is unacceptable, especially when it prevents me from accessing bookings and benefits I’ve paid for. This isn’t just an inconvenience, it’s a violation of trust and feels like a failure to uphold customer rights. I’ve been more than patient, but it’s shocking that Wizz Air would treat paying customers this way. I expect my membership to be activated immediately or my money refunded in full, along with compensation for the time I’ve lost.

### “my experience was very positive”
I was pleasantly surprised by my flight from Paris Orly to Rome Fiumicino, and absolutely feel that my ticket was good value for money. Although this is a budget airline, I found Wizz Air extremely transparent about inclusions, relevant information and services that incurred additional fees; while no food or drinks were provided for free, nor was checked baggage, Wizz Air communicated this beforehand. I purchased checked luggage, early check-in and seat selection ahead of the flight and had no trouble accessing any of the services I bought. While these features all came at an extra cost, at no point did I feel this was unclear. Just make sure you read about what each ticket does (and doesn’t) include and you should be fine. All ground and cabin crew were helpful and respectful, the seats were comfortable, the flight attendants regularly checked to see if anyone wanted to purchase anything, and the flight arrived early. I would definitely fly with Wizz Air again, my experience was very positive and I hope others similarly enjoy quick, cheap and friendly service with this airline.

### "Customer service is diabolical"
Not Verified |  Wizzair is absolutely the worst low-cost airline company, not even comparable to Ryanair or Easyjet. The app system is completely fallible, illogic, customer service is non existent and I manage to find the correct call center number after more than 10 minutes of research. It's incomprehensible why they would hate their clients so much that they make asking for simple assistance so complicated. I'm sorry for people who work there as they do an amazing job and it's not their fault if its so horribly organized. In-flight experience was good. Customer service is diabolical.

### "airline sold too many tickets"
Not Verified | I bought a ticket 1.5 months ago and still didn't fly because airline sold too many tickets. Lady at the customer service stated that it is legal and that the airline is issuing 10% more tickets than they have seats, because someone is always late or can cancel. In this case, me and 2 other people did not fly. The lady from customer services notified us that they are trying to force people to buy seats, and that every day someone is not allowed to board because they do overbooking. This is the last time I bought tickets from this airline.

### “Horrible experience”
Not Verified | Horrible experience! The flights are always delayed, for starters. They are very predatory and try to milk every cent out of their clients. The "luggage patrol" ladies were very disrespectful. They charged me and others $65 extra for my backpack, which was slightly thicker than the required size. Hideous company!

### "worst experience I have ever had"
Not Verified | By far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I’d like to start by saying that all of the staff I dealt with were apologetic and respectful, but the policies this business holds are predatory and not standard. I have never experienced mandatory online check in before, and was told it’s a 90€ fee for not checking in online prior. They do not make this clear/purposely leave this information very vague hoping this situation happens to most people. Also when you book check in luggage, their standard weight is 10kg NOT 20kg. You also have to pay for any cabin overhead luggage. As to be expected, after paying all of these hidden fees our flight was delayed by several hours.

### “big delays with little information”
Not Verified | I do not recommend flying with WizzAir at all. I wish they get canceled as a company or drastically improve their standards. I regret switching to WizzAir from Lufthansa as my main travel company. I switch back to Lufthansa. WizzAir claims to be low cost, but in reality they will always scam a few passengers per flight and make them pay more for the stupidiest things. I lost 150€ these days for the stupidiest "reasons". They have big delays with little information, and their crew barely even knows the rules. They will do anything to make you pay more. Conclusion: Ryanair > Wizzair, and even better: Lufthansa.

### "certainly not use this company again"
Not Verified | We purchased a flight from Lisbon-Budapest-Lisbon for 3 people. Very attractive prices and, despite the online criticism, we decided to take a chance. We bought flights for 3 people and added 10 kg luggage to take anything else besides our backpacks. From Lisbon to Budapest everything went beautifully and we didn't have any problems. However, in Budapest it was terrible. From the service provided by the guy at the counter to the unclear information on the website that misleads the customer. We had to pay for one of the girls' backpacks, which didn't have any problems at Lisbon and we also had to pay another €53 for the 10kg luggage (which we had already paid €103 for when purchasing the flights). The information on the website is not clear regarding this luggage and misleads the customer. Furthermore, in Lisbon we didn't have any problems with this luggage. They could send an email specifying that this 10kg luggage cannot go with us and that it would have to be placed in the hold. I think once the customer buys it, they could be more specific. Furthermore, I believe that the way the boy was treating everyone is not justified. Ill-mannered, arrogant and unfriendly. I will certainly not use this company again!

### "a horrible experience"
Not Verified |  One of the worst airline. They charged almost €50/person just because we didn't check in online they didn’t gave us any information. We had round trip from London to Istanbul, while leaving London they didn't ask anything about check in online but on Istanbul they charged extra we waited for hours in line and then they gave us the news. It was a horrible experience

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified | Worst experience ever, they are taking charges for airport check-in. On the way to immigration they stopped for size of the bag. I requested so much but still rushing throughout with 2 small kids n bags, again I have to pay for baggage. But at a destination my baggage was missing now it's 40hrs of the complained a report, I didn't receive any information from the airlines yet nor they are answering my queries. It's so frustrating like am not able to track my own baggage even after Paying extra amount which was as same as of ticket amount.

### “Flight attendants were very rude”
Flight attendants were very rude, one named Khadijah was shouting at me because I brought some food and drinks which everyone does because of limited options on flight. She asked me to give her my passport! Which I didn’t and told her only the authorities at Abu Dhabi or at Rome can ask for my passport, then her colleague came and was threatening me which shocked all the passengers. It was a horrible experience and never again on this airline.

### "a good low-cost airline"
Not Verified |  Flew with Wizz Air from Warsaw to Barcelona on A321ceo. Flight is 2 hours and 40 minutes long. It was a pleasure to fly with such a friendly international cabin crew. Seats are not the best, there is no food included, from entertainment there is only one magazine. WizzAir is a good low-cost airline that gets passengers from A to B for less than 50 euros.

### “aircraft looked tired and worn out”
Not Verified | I have flown this route twice (taking time to get through their complicated website and finally book a ticket) and both times the flight has been delayed substantially. This time the delay was over three hours and there was virtually no communication whilst waiting in the lounge. The boarding of the plane was slow and chaotic. When home I tried to contact Wizz about the delay but they do not provide any way of contacting them by e mail. Their website froze when I tried to do an online complaint. Apparently if you phone them it is also impossible to get through. Clearly the management do not care to receive or deal with ordinary customer complaints. In addition to all the above the poor staff on board the aircraft looked tired and worn out. The plane was an old Airbus with some of the most worn out uncomfortable seats ever. The announcements were incomprehensible. At the airport the baggage took ages to arrive. All in all a very poor experience. Needless to say I will never book with this airline again.

### “lack of professionalism and understanding”
On September 11, at Heraklion Airport in Crete, Greece, I accompanied a disabled friend on their flight from Heraklion to Bucharest, which was scheduled to depart at 9:20 p.m. Unfortunately, the experience was marked by a lack of organization. There is no designated desk for wheelchair assistance and we had to wait until check-in opened two hours before departure. The main problem was the unavailability of a wheelchair. When one was finally found the check in agent was extremely rude. Despite the fact that the need for assistance was clearly stated on the ticket, he asked us in detail about the nature of my friend's disability. After waiting another 30 minutes for the wheelchair, the agent refused to give priority to my friend, even though this is standard procedure for passengers with disabilities. Instead, he insisted on serving others in line who did not have mobility issues. The check-in agent threatened to delay us further if we continued to ask questions, which he eventually did. In all my experience with airports, I have never encountered a situation where a disabled passenger is not given priority. The blonde lady at check-in showed a clear lack of professionalism and understanding of boarding procedures. In our opinion, she is not suited for the role and would greatly benefit from additional training. I am deeply disappointed with Wizz Air and it seems that the service with this airline continues to deteriorate.

### "staff attitude was horrible"
Not Verified |  My flight from Kutaisi to Abu Dhabi was delayed more than 1 hour to depart. This was because to wait deportation passengers to fill their vacant seats. Captain announced they will wait 5-10 minutes, but actual waiting time was 1 hour and staff attitude was horrible. I missed my connection flight because of this incident

### "terrible customer experience"
Not Verified |  Absolute worst Customer Service ever. Not only WizzAir has cancelled my flight but they almost force you into rebooking with them as the option whereby you can ask for a refund does not work online, therefore you are redirected with the rebooking credit (120% of your initial spend with them). No direct Custom Service line in the UK - nightmare to find a number that works (had to ring them in Malta multiple times). On the day I call them they say they will proceed with my refund within 10 days. The very next day I notice payments to wizzair on my bank account, ring them again to find out what it is about and clearly bookings have been made with my card details but they are not allowed to disclose the name of the passenger nor the route (which would be an easy check that we haven't booked it ourselves). Weeks pass and the money is still not in my account - even worse they supposedly investigate my case and in the end say that they cannot do anything and will leave it there - no indication that they have contacted the other person(s) who used our bank details in a fraudulent fashion, nor that they suffered a data breach (which is according to me the only viable explanation). Absolute waste of time, energy and what a terrible customer experience! Never again!

### "terrible experience at check-in"
A completely terrible experience at check-in counter #63 at Lisbon Airport. I was traveling with a friend, and we had purchased baggage allowances of 20 kg for me and 11 kg for her. The staff member at the counter checked in my friend's bag under my name and then refused to check in my suitcase, claiming that I had already checked in an 11 kg bag. The employee displayed total unprofessionalism, and I don't know what I would have done if it weren't for the help of other people.

### "receiving terrible service"
Despite being a Wizzair Plus member and selecting a priority tier to ensure a convenient flight for myself and my family—paying extra for the service—my experience with Wizzair was terrible Wizzair not only offers cheap airfare but also an equally poor experience for its customers. If you're okay with regular flight delays, standing for 2 hours during check-in, paying unnecessary fees due to tricky terms and conditions, sacrificing your comfort, receiving terrible service on board, dealing with rude flight attendants, and receiving damaged luggage after your flight then to have your complaints and inquiries ignored then Wizzair is the perfect nightmare for you.

### "Our last time with Wizz Air"
Not Verified | Wizz Air kept pushing us to check in online. So we did. At the airport in Larnaca, 60 minutes before departure we were refused bag drop and forced to delay our return trip by two days. No caring, no "what you can do next", no nothing. Our last time with Wizz Air.

### "misleading information provided"
Approximately 30 minutes after purchasing tickets online for a round-trip journey from Bucharest to Malta (confirmation code: ZDYUTB), I realized that I needed to cancel the return flight and book an alternative flight from another airline for an earlier date. I promptly contacted WIZZ AIR customer service to explain the situation. The representative assured me that it would be acceptable to cancel the return flight and that I would be reimbursed in WIZZ credits. However, contrary to what I was told, the cancellation resulted in the loss of both my outbound and return flights, leaving me without tickets and without reimbursement. Since that time, over the past week, I have repeatedly called and emailed WIZZ AIR, requesting the reinstatement of the initial booking I paid for or, at the very least, a review of the recorded conversation to verify the misleading information provided by their employee. I would like to emphasize that, had I been properly informed, I would never have voluntarily canceled the flights, knowing it would result in such a significant financial loss.

### "it’s always late"
Not Verified |   Wizz Air, just a joke, not an air transport company - it’s always late, have delays, not in time, always changing the flight in the last moment… I don’t know how other companies can be on time and this one not… never answer, never apologise. But for now on, I will not use no more…

### “Zero communication, zero compensation”
Don't travel with them if you don't have to. Zero communication, zero compensation, incredible delays of planes even on short routes, or they cancel it outright. Never never never again!

### "they refused compensation claim"
Flew with them 7 times so far, every single flight was delayed, last delay was 24 hours and they refused compensation claim, no idea how the EU letting this company keep getting away with this.

### "very unpolite and rude with us"
Not Verified |   They cancelled the flight and did not offer any reason. They said they dont have any alternative flight back and then they kept us 7 hours in the airport until they offered us a hotel for the night at 70km distance from airport and they did not offered any transport back to the airport in the morning. They did not offer us water or food during the waiting time as the law says. The staff operators there were very unpolite and rude with us and shouted many times at all of us when asking for information. They did not refund our expenses because of the cancelled flight and we ended up spending more than 500 euros to come back home, I almost lost my job because it took 3 days to return home. And we waited 7 hours to get a transport to a hotel and first time they sent a minivan with 8 places and after another hour of waiting they send a normal big bus to take us all to hotel.

### "transfer service was highly disappointing"
My dissatisfaction with the airport transfer service provided by Wizz Air in Baku, Azerbaijan. Unfortunately, our experience was far from satisfactory, and I feel compelled to share the issues we encountered. Despite the voucher indicating that the driver would wait at the arrival area, we found no one there upon our arrival. My partner called the contact number provided, only to be told that they were unaware of our scheduled transfer. After sending the confirmation voucher via WhatsApp, we had to wait for over an hour before the car finally arrived. The vehicle that arrived was old, broken, and lacked air conditioning. We paid AED 241 (approximately AZN 111.55) for this service, which is quite expensive. Considering the high cost, we expected a better experience. In comparison, using the local app BOLT, the same journey would have cost just 7 manats. Our experience with Wizz Air's airport transfer service was highly disappointing and not worth the expense. I hope that you will take this feedback seriously and take the necessary steps to improve your services to prevent other customers from having a similar experience.

### "refused my refund claim request"
Wizz Air kept the charge for luggage I didn't actually use, payment for a specific seat but then changed aircraft and after three days of my relentlessly trying to check-in both online and on the Wizz Air app I arrive at Gatwick Airport South at 01:00am for a 5:35am flight to no try and check in to no staff or self checkin kiosk and consequently had to wait until just before 4am for one person to eventual arrive and then charge me further to check-in even after explaining and then sending screenshot evidence attachments and also the receipt. Wizz Air unlawfully charged me and refused my refund claim request also even due to their having both system error, website issues and Wizz Air app technical issues today they have the audacity to send an email update stating that their system is working again for people to use and book further flights. I have never flown with Wizz Air and had taken a wellness trip via holiday prior to my having major surgery so booked via agency Loveholidays to stay in a wellness hotel in Marrakech and have never been been more stressed or treated so unfairly and disrespectfully than I have with Wizz Air and this has been my first and ONLY time ever flying with them. What a great first impression you left. I am disgusted disappointed and extremely let down ... so to now receive today's celebratory email update saying your system is working now is ignorant distasteful and a sacrilege.

### “service was severely lacking”
Not Verified | I recently flew with Wizz Air and it was the worst flight experience I've ever had. The service was severely lacking, with the cabin crew displaying rude behavior throughout the journey. To top it off, the flight was delayed by three hours, which was incredibly frustrating. I would not recommend flying with Wizz Air based on this experience.

### "Awful experience"
Not Verified |   Awful experience. We received countless emails about checking in online or face payments at the airport. I tried several times on numerous computers to check-in and enter our flight details, with the same response each time saying 'We had failed online check-in'. We tried to contact Wizz Air but you would have better luck finding the end of a rainbow. We turned up at the airport with panic and anxiety, unsure if we were able to fly. Uninterested staff checked us in telling us we have to check in at the airport. On the return flight, we had the same emails and panic but thinking we had to check-in at the airport, we didn't take any notice of them. Only for the staff at the airport to charge us more than the complete price of the flights as punishment for not checking in online! Their answer was that the two departing airports are different. Nowhere on any of the paperwork does it mention that these airports are different! A complete disgrace and impossible to contact or complain to. Completely disgusting service. Don't use them, you will regret it.

### "service is rude and unhelpful"
Not Verified |   Got my flight rescheduled one week prior to the date of the flight for a date 3 whole weeks after the original purchased date. Customer service costs five euros a call, and you have to make various to get around a reschedule, because service is rude and unhelpful. I ended up wasting 70 euros worth of calls to change the flight to a date that suited my schedule, and had a horrible experience doing so, I received responses on the light of "we have zero flexibility here", "I heard you, but will not solve your problem, I'll leave a note, call back again in an hour". I had the phone hanged up to mid-call several times, and denied information and support. Only could I solve by showing up to the actual WIZZ office on the airport

### “They have no respect for passengers”
On the 04.07.2024 I had my flight back to UK from Romania at 06:10 morning time. All good until the boarding was complete. The flight departure was settled for 06:10 and after 30 min of delay I activated the service button so I can ask one of the crew members about how long the delay will be. A lady from the crew came and she didn’t had an answer regarding how long the delay will be, I asked to be kept informed about this issue and she replied that she will ask the pilot to make an announcement. Nothing happened. No messages from Wizz Air company regarding the delay, no information provided by the crew members. I was just waiting knowing nothing. After another 20 min of waiting I see other lady from the crew coming out from the pilot cabin. Thinking that she may know something by now, especially because she stayed with the Capitan, I activated again the service button so I can ask her about the delay. She then came to me asking me straight away if I speak Romanian to which I replied yes. Then she asked me again if I'm sure I speak Romanian and I replied that for the last 40 years I keep on talking Romanian daily as I'm a Romanian citizen. This questions put me in such embarrassment and discomfort. I felt like a child at the kindergarten. The lady crew member then told me that “this is not a bus to answer how long the delay will be” to which I replied that I know and as well I haven't paid £1 for the ticket. Then, the lady crew member saw that I was having my mobile phone in my hand and told me that filming the crew is not allowed and asked me to delete the video. I replied to her that I did not film the crew or the cabin to which she demanded to handle my phone to her so she could check if there is any video with the crew. I refused to give her my personal item because she doesn't have the legal right to ask me this and only the competent authorities can ask for this. She then called the Frontier Police to escort me out from the plane. I need to specify that during the whole interaction between me and the lady crew member I had a decent language, I didn't engage other passengers, I wasn't aggressive with anyone, I wasn’t under the influence of any substance and I did no damage. Even being escorted I kept my calm. The lady crew member gave me a paper called “the final warning” in which she mentioned the fact that I was talking loud and bad towards the crew and I refused to delete the video with the crew. Which video, which bad words? I did not had the right to reply or to agree or disagree with what she wrote down on the “the final warning” sheet. The Frontier Police said that not even they are allowed to ask me to handle my personal item. This lady crew member attitude put me in such a big discomfort from all points of view. And as an end to my story, as an advice I would say: For your mental and social health avoid Wizz Air!! They have no respect for their passengers and they are abusing the power that they have as a whole company!

### "Fly with them at your own peril"
You should avoid this airline at all costs. They will be late 100% of the time, and they will rob you 50% of the times. I paid for a 1st row seat and they changed me to the row 36. No “sorry”, no money back. Just taking my money. Fly with them at your own peril

### "Every flight is delayed"
I am a regular flyer from Bucharest to Birmingham, Luton, Gatwick and Stansted. On the plus side: New planes, lots of space and more seats. Nice uniforms. Reasonable ticket prices. On the downside: Every flight is delayed up to one hour. Luggage prices are expensive, so are seat prices and then they moved me (3 times now) to let the staff have my seat during the flight, as I always choose the rear window seat, to ease my claustrophobia! Very limited in flight service, so no food or drinks etc. They change flight times and your seat number online, without notice, leading to several confrontations. Conclusion; Nice shiny planes but expensive add-ons and 9/10 flights are late by an hour! I will revert to Ryanair and their grotty old (cut cheap) planes next flight!

### "do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |   My recent experience with Wizz Air was incredibly frustrating due to their poorly highlighted online check-in process. There is no prominent information indicating that passengers need to complete online check-in before arriving at the counter, or they will face a penalty. This detail is buried at the bottom of the page, which many people, especially first-time travelers, may not notice. As a result, I found myself in a long queue at the airport only to be informed that I had to pay a penalty of AED 190 for not checking in online. This was a huge disappointment and a stressful experience. I strongly urge Wizz Air to update their website and app to clearly inform passengers about the necessity of online check-in to avoid such penalties. In addition to the check-in issue, Wizz Air has numerous hidden clauses and additional charges that passengers need to be aware of. While the initial ticket price appears low, they start adding various fees, such as admin fees and charges for baggage over 10 kg. This deceptive practice results in a much higher final cost than initially advertised. I booked with Wizz Air only once, and I will never make that mistake again. I do not recommend this airline to anyone. If you have to spend a little more, consider other airlines to avoid the dissatisfaction and hidden fees associated with Wizz Air.

### "Do not travel with this airline"
Flight W46011, on 07/03/2024, which left at 6:15 am from Rome to Madrid the boarding stewards made us pay for a suitcase when it was already included in the ticket, after trying to show them the ticket where it indicated that it included hand luggage, one of the stewards threw the suitcase at my friend and said she would call the police, In addition to giving us humiliating treatment, they intimidate you by not letting you fly. We paid for it because we had to work the next day and we are new at work. Do not travel with this airline.

### "you end up paying twice more"
Wizz Air cancelled the flight i booked, causing me approximately 1000 euro in additional expenses to book alternative flight. Initially I was offered around 30% refund. After i received 271.61 out of 405.32 euro paid under excuse that the luggage is not refundable. No matter that i explained numerous times that the company itself cancelled the flight, and that the service I paid for, to fly my luggage from A to B wasn't delivered, Nothing helped. Just got idiotic AI reply from their support. Every time you fly with these guys to save money, you end up paying twice more. Not again.

### "Miserable from any point of view!
The worst experience that I have ever had. I can’t believe that this company is still allowed to fly. Miserable from each and any point of view!

### “Best airline for backpack travelers”
Best airline for backpack travelers. The cabin crew staff Pepa very helpful. She understand our requirement and helped us immediately. As budget airline the staff is very helpful and hospitality wise great. Thank you Wizz air.

### "this is truly a nightmare"
Not Verified |   Really a bad airline. Got very expensive over the last year but only provides red eye flights which are frequently delayed or cancelled. Costs seem low initially for the flight, but really if you add luggage, seat selection you are better off just flying with an established carrier not this so called low-cost. Another hidden cost is that Wizz usually flies to airports very far away from the marketed destination. So in the end you have to spend another 20-30 euros for a bus or another transfer. So is it still low cost? Seats are cramped. Service is all at a cost, not even water is provided. Plus the very annoying sales of perfumes and other amenities which are aggressively promoted via the intercom system. For European standards this is truly a nightmare. Next time you fly just consider all the costs and maybe decide to avoid Wizz..

### "No customer support"
Not Verified |   For 2 and a half hours flight the plane had a 3 hours delay on one way and 4 hours delay on the return flight. No customer support, just a a phone number with huge extra fare where nobody answers. Terrible crew, rude and unprofessional. Not even close cheap enough for the awful service they provide.

### "extra 120 EUR for cabin luggage"
Not Verified |   I had to pay an extra 120 EUR for cabin luggage, check in and service cost and service fee. Upon doing so I complained to the check in lady who called me a psychopath and started swearing and told me she has put me on wizz airs disruptive passenger list not just for that flight but for all of wizz Air flights and I would be unable to travel. She continued swearing at me, said she would called the police, I urged her to to so but she refused as I was not aggressive nor insultive and then I falsely told me she banned me also forever from Larnaca airport. I asked for a refund for my 120 EUR I just paid to Wizz since they banned me from the flight and they refused. I then contacted the airport police who tried to get me on the flight by speaking to her and she refused.

### "refused to refund the money"
Horrible experience. They change my flights (both inbound and outbound) timings 2 hours earlier than what it was supposed to be, which made it impossible for me and my family to catch either of the flights due to other plans. Even though I booked the highest fare they have which is refundable, they refused to refund the money to me, they only offered to keep the money in my "Wizz Account", which can be used only to fly with them within 3 months, and that I definitely can not do. Their customer support is a joke. So it ended up where I can't do the flight because of their changes, but at the same time I lost my money which I paid for their so called "refundable" tickets. Please do not cheap out and book with them, check this airline's reviews, and you will know what I mean, horrible service, horrible timings. I have no idea how are they still allowed to operate.

### "Avoid Wizz Air at all cost"
Avoid Wizz Air at all cost. My flight was cancelled just 12 hours before the flight. The 'alternative' that they offered was the next day but when I tried to book it, their website was saying all seats are booked and there are no free left! I had to buy another expensive indirect flight from other airlines the last minute. Most outrageously, Wizzair refused to give me any compensation (though the EU law requires it). Please avoid these airlines, they operate like a criminal gang and the customer service does not exist.

### "Avoid Wizz Air at all cost"
Avoid Wizz Air at all cost. I couldn’t check in due to a site error that didn’t allow me to enter my phone number. It took customer support 30 minutes to figure out the issue and the solution was “enter 1234567890 as your number”. The flight has been delayed two times.

### “Unprofessional, rude Cabin Crew”
Unprofessional, rude Cabin Crew. They were talking to each other loudly, laughing loudly, mocking passengers in English understanding that the passengers from Uzbekistan knew no English, and singing songs causing disturbance to the passengers. Once informed, the team leader came and said "You can't comment on our staff". The whole team was unprofessional. I have never experienced this ever in any other airline. This incident happened on my journey on 07/03/2024 traveling from Samarkand to Abu Dhabi.

### "sad what's happening in 2024"
Not Verified |   I have been flying with this company for 11 years but today I was totally disappointed because I bought the seat at the back of the aircraft and when the meal was served I didn't have the opportunity to buy another sandwich and the peanuts I received were moldy. The flight attendant's explanation was that there were no more sandwiches for those at the back of the plane. I warn travelers who pay for their seats to buy in the front and middle only so they will be able to eat a sandwich and drink a beer or wine. It's sad what's happening in 2024. Zbor de 11 ani cu aceasta companie dar azi am fost total dezamăgită deoarece am cumpărat locul in spatele aeronavei și când s-a servit masa nu am avut ocazia sa mai cumpăr un sandvici și alunele primite erau mucegăite. Explicația stuardezei a fost ca nu au mai ajuns sandviciuri și pentru cei din spatele avionului. Avertizez călătorii care își plătesc locurile sa cumpere in fata și mijloc doar asa vor putea sa manance un sandvici și sa bea o bere sau vin. E trist ce se întâmplă în 2024.

### “Fly with someone else”
Not Verified | Avoid whenever possible. I have flown to over 20 countries with more than 15 airlines regularly traveling to Poland to visit my partners family. I always use the same carry-on bag for my laptop and a few clothes totalling around 9kg where the laptop is 5kg it comfortably and easily fits into all overhead compartments on all planes i have been on. Measuring my bag it is exactly the size they agree to for the non priority ticket, but due to a hard base and slightly protruding wheels of about 1.5cm it wouldn't fit in their overly small "measure" for this they hit you with an added £57.00. Wizz Air are money grubbing scum. Where they allowed the bag on the way out with no issue. Fly with someone else if you can. I am absolutely disgusted by their destruction of my weekend with my partner meeting her family for one of their wedding anniversary.

### “never experienced such terrible service”
Not Verified | Worst airline ever. I had to pay 44 pounds for them to print my boarding pass and 54 pounds for my carry on. This airline is an absolute robbery. I have never experienced such terrible service at any other airline. Do NOT fly with them. I for sure will never fly with this horrendous airline. The value for money rating should be negative. 1 star is WAY too generous for this airline.

### "pay for luggage again"
My flight was not only delayed but also I was mislead by staff at the gate, telling me first to wait with check-in and later to take my luggage onboard. At the gate, staff and supervisor were very rude and asked me to pay for luggage again. At their customer service, they responded with some generic respond, not really related to my case.

### "euro 45 to issue a boarding pass"
The airline charged me euro 45 to issue a boarding pass at the airport for the reason that i have not checked online. I had no checked luggage and i have paid for seat and for priority check in. I have no problem paying any cost for the airline ticket price, the seats, the priority boarding..etc.. this is the business model, however, paying a fee to issue a boarding pass is a little bit too much. When i tried to check online their app was not working.

### "charged us 135 EUR for check in"
On our way back from Bucharest the Wizz Air app for checking in was unavailable. The airline company charged us 135 EUR for check in although it was their app that did not work and they did not leave us any options for alternative check in methods. They only answer we got was to claim a refund through their homepage. When we did this they claimed that we couldn't get any refund back.

### “Worst airline ever”
Not Verified | Worst airline ever. Charged me 44 pounds to print my boarding ticket. Then charged me 54 more pounds for my carry on bag that I have never have had to pay for in 20 different airlines. Never flying with them again and please do NOT fly with them. Worst airline experience in 20+ years of travel.

### "such unruly staff"
Haven't dealt with such unruly staff ever. They were really rude to us when we asked them why the flight was delayed by an hour, then 90 minutes, and finally by a 120 minutes. This is all starting from 23:00 hours mind you. Also, how on earth does an airline not put tickets of people under the same PNR in seats next to each other? My fiancé had the emergency exit seat and had nobody sitting next to her but they still refused to seat us together after the flight took off. Horrible.

### "I would never use them again"
I never write bad reviews but feel travels must be aware what they are signing up for. They charged me £163 to check in at the airport but their website was not working for online check in. Then they changed all the seats around after our booking and my 12 year old daughter was left to sit by herself and the worse of all they did not unload half of the luggage. At least 50 people in line without any bags. The airline did nothing. In my 40 years of traveling I never felt more disrespect and they have zero customer service. I don’t care what the cost is. I would never use them again.

### "Cabin crew was friendly"
Flight slightly delayed (10-15 minutes). I do not have much expectation from them but to fly me to destination in reasonable time, which they did. Travelled light, cabin luggage only with priority boarding and XXL seat. Cabin crew was friendly and funny. Clearing the airport was slowed by luggage screen at exit.

### “there are so many additional costs”
Not Verified | Wizz Air seems very cheap at first but there are so many additional costs. At least, I should get a service for what I pay. I purchased priority boarding. Priority boarding allows to enter first without waiting but they were so bad at managing it so it was all mess. People who didn't purchase priority were trying to pass before me and nobody from Wizzair said anything looking at it. It's not even economic airline, not like Ryanair or easyJet. Seat is extremely uncomfortable as well.

### "stay in queue for another 2 hours"
Even if I had online check-in I had to stay in queue for another 2 hours to have it done in the airport. They charge you for a 3 hours flight more than a business flight to Barcelona or Turkey.

### “prioritizes profit over passenger safety”
Not Verified | Beware of Wizz Air! I purchased a croissant on my flight from Lithuania to Luton, London, only to find out it was expired for three weeks. It highlighted the complete lack of product checks by the crew. When I contacted customer service, their response was dismissive, refusing any refund for the tainted purchase. It's evident that Wizz Air prioritizes profit over passenger safety and satisfaction. Save yourself the trouble and avoid Wizz Air. Their negligence and poor customer service are inexcusable.

### "50 euro to check in at the airport"
Not Verified |   I did not manage to use the app for check in. To my surprise it will cost you 50 euro to check in at the airport. In the end this becomes another expensive airline, but with peculiar luggage allowance and not even a bottle of water included. Do not recommend.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |   I have never been so disgusted with an Airline in all my life, I booked these flights months in advance and picked the flight times wisely as I am travelling with my Toddler so we need to travel in the day, and just over a week before they inform us that they have changed the flights, so now they are flying at night, when I ring to tell them I need to cancel they say they will not refund the money as it is within the 301 minutes allowed time frame. They changed the flight by exactly 300 minutes, so now we have to buy new flights with easyjet and be £500 out of pocket because they refuse to refund us for a flight we can no longer make now because they changed the flight, simply not good enough, Disgusting behaviour from them, never fly with them again

### "no compensation from Wizz Air"
We flew from Vienna to Malaga arrival was about 10 PM, after arrival we have been waiting for the luggage and as we traveled with kids stroller as well. When the stroller arrived it was completely damaged, because the one front wheel was broken from the frame (no repair possible, later confirmed by manufacture also). I wanted to find at the airport responsible person from Wizz Air - baggage claim, however they were closed, I asked another airlines offices as Ryanair (next to Wizz Air) they are closed maybe will open, maybe not but you can wait .. it was already 10:40PM, so I wanted to reach Wizz Air support via phone - I was not successful. We decided to go to our accommodation by taking the taxi, it was approx. 100km from the airport, during the route I have submitted online claim (16th April 2024) form. Today 6th May 2024, I have received feedback that I don't have a PIR report, so they are going to close the case. Okay I understand, but how I could get the PIR report, when their office was closed? The cost of new frame - confirmed by damage report is 350 EUR - no compensation from Wizz Air. Next time it is worth to fly via more expensive airlines which they have open baggage claim office, when their plane is coming to the airport and something similar can happened.

### "a very unpleasant experience"
Not Verified |   Wizz Air is not worth it at all. better to give more money for a big and expensive airline, even if you know what awaits you. when we were supposed to go to Paris, they protested in Paris and their flight was cancelled, while other airlines just moved their flights. They didn't answer the phone, and when they did, they gave us false information and seats on planes that didn't exist, flights were constantly changed so that in the end there would be nothing. As we managed to leave, but not via them, the return flight was via them, and that's where the problem with flight confirmation turned out to be. It had to be confirmed no later than 3 hours earlier, which we tried, however, their website did not work and we could not, and they charged us an additional 25 euros per person, it did not matter that it was not our fault and that we have proof that the website did not work. No one knows how to give information to whom to file a complaint and ask for a refund, but we were only told that if we don't pay, there are no tickets for us even if we bought them. to make matters worse, we were given a seat at the exit in case of danger, and we were traveling with a child under 16 who cannot sit there because it is not allowed, so a problem arose and we had to move and beg people to switch seats with us. All in all a very unpleasant experience, which cost the same as if we had gone with AirSerbia, only in a much ruder way. Skip it, it's not worth the hassle and the money.

### "Worst staff in the world"
Worst staff in the world. Unfortunately this time I had to fly wizz Air due to no other airlines available. Never ever again. Staff keep looking for problems and want to charge you for everything and argue with you. They didn’t even have any drinks and food left on our flight. They have no respect towards customers at all. Wizz Air staff are 20 years behind our civilisation, their behaviour is old minded.

### "pay full price for carry on"
You can add a carry on type of weight with your ticket but small print says its for check in. Although I went to check in with my big laggauge they didn't alert to check it in. When boarding flight they asked me to pay full price for carry on / extra price and didn't let me check in or get a reimbursement for it. They were delaying people in front of me each one for a different carry on luggage reason. It looked like they had a quata of extra charges and the lady at the desk was behind rude.

### "Run away from this company"
I bought a return ticket with Wizzair. When checking in online I upgraded my seats, for which I paid €58. When trying to complete my check in, the message "flight overpaid" appears, as the system did not assumed thee payment of the extra amount as a seat upgrade. They didn't let me check in online. At Lisbon airport, they verified the error and checked me in, free of charge, saying that the problem had been resolved. In Budapest, when I try to check in online, the same message appears and I am not allowed to check in online. I called customer support, (a added value number) to the number indicated on the website for Portugal, and it says it doesn't work. I went to the airport, where there is no company office (but they say they´re the biggest hungarian air line company). I went to the check in counter and they forced me to pay a €40 fee for checking in at the airport. Even after checking the situation, and my inability to check in online due to the company's fault and error, I had to pay this fee or I would not come to Portugal. When a complaint was made to the company, they responded that checking in at the airport involves a fee of €40 and that there is nothing more to say. With all this, I paid €58 to upgrade my seats, plus a €40 fee for not letting me check in online and also the price of the tickets. Low cost? Run away from this company

### "Wizz Air canceled my flight"
Wizz Air canceled my flight from Rome to Kuwait (W46183) and provided no flight cancellation email to me (despite what they claim). I ended up paying hundreds of Euros for an additional night in a hotel and a new, more expensive, flight with a different airline. They are scammers, comfortable lying on the phone and hanging up on you.

### "a great experience"
Not Verified |   My flight on 28/3/2024 from Larnaca to Luton was superb. Check-in a breeze, the flight left on time and arrived early at Luton. I paid just over £35 for a 5 hour flight on a clean aircraft crewed by kind and attentive staff. A guy called Parris seemed to be the cabin steward and was polite and attentive as were all the staff on this flight. Food at best adequate but I usually take my own anyway. Comfortable seats, plenty of room and storage. I have flown with Wizz on several other occasions and have never had cause for complaint. Hold Luggage is pricy so that needs to be factored in but as I went with a free underseat wheeled bag I paid nothing other than the ticket price. Thanks again Wizz Air and thanks to Parris and the rest of the crew for what was a great experience.

### "Unbelievably unprofessional staff"
Unbelievably unprofessional staff. Rude and incompetent over their own rules with luggage and customer care. This by far was mind-blowing. Beware of their luggage size scam when at every one of their terminals. One of their staff says one thing and the other one says a different. It doesn't matter if you are premium, you will be given a hassle. If you're slightly a couple cm oversized, you will likely be charged 60 dollars if not more as they tried to do me but I refused to comply and succeeded. Management should introspect and train properly. Folks, while your luggage may be slight oversized ... stop, pack your stuff small tight! Explore your other options! Let's get it together Wizz air. Enough is enough!

### “rip off merchants”
I had a problem with online check-in, so I went to the airport without completing the online check-in. They charged me £167.62 to check-in 4 people. This process took approximately an extra minute. It involved scanning 4 passports and printing out 4 boarding passes. That is an hourly rate of approximately £10 000 an hour. In my opinion they cannot justify this, are rip off merchants, and are disgraceful organization. I will never use them again.

### "not use their airline again"
In August 2023, I flew on vacation with my family. The flight was delayed for 12 hours, sat at the airport all day, the flight was constantly rescheduled, there were absolutely no refunds. Provided information for returns and refunds. I’ve been writing to them for a year now, every month, they constantly promise to make a refund and do nothing. Terrible company! I will not use their airline again!

### "charge you extra 50 Euro"
They lock your app so you can't check in and then they charge you extra 50 Euro. They make problem to your flight in order to call them and charge you about 20 Euro or more. No one is answering. Is a ghost company. Be careful. They are stealing your money.

### "Cabin crew was nice"
Flight on time, boarding was fast and efficient. During the short flight paid catering service was provided and on-board shopping was available. Cabin crew was nice. No extras, just the flight.

### “Unacceptable company”
Unacceptable company, with frequent cancellations, does not pay any attention to the passenger, even the plane had uncomfortable seats, and the pilot made a steep landing. Overall very bad experience.

### “theres no food included”
Traveling 6h from 19h to 1am, surprised theres no food included. - Only small bag included so had to pay 130€ (60 for one flight and 70 for another one even though it was a transfer with the same company). Felt like a scam. - seats are very uncomfortable with no leg space. - toilet was very dirty and no toilet paper. - second flight was delayed more than an hour. - long waitings for the buses that connect airport gate to plane.

### “such an unreliable airline”
This is a review regarding an overbooking of my son. He was actually supposed to fly today, regularly checked in online and with some extra but left grounded for overbooking at the counter. As a medical student he will be missing his lectures and tests, and there is no way the company can compensate for such inconvenience. In case of unexcused unattendance he might be further penalised by the school. I will never book him again with such an unreliable airline and I do not recommend it to anyone who is flying on a tight/non-flexible schedule.

### "did not want to refund the payments"
I bought 2 connecting flights from Paris to Antalya with the connection point Cluj Napoca. The company cancelled the second flight and did not want to refund the payments for the non cancelled flight. Never purchase air tickets from that company if you do not want to lose your money

### "Absolutely appalling service"
Absolutely appalling service. We received an email to check in online but when we clicked the link it said our itinerary did not exist. When we arrived at check in we where informed that we had to pay about $75 per person to check in. We had screen shot proof of their problem but the so called manager refused to help.

### "one of the worst companies"
It is one of the worst companies to fly and even though initially considered as cheap, in the booking course is not! When I have the option to fly with another company on the day & route, I always avoid Wizz. Charging for cabin luggage more than ticket. Recently there is no option for random seat. It has to be paid extra! So what is the purchased ticket for? For any reason, a change is required, you will get charged for calling to their call centre, making change , even changing name is €50. Customer care is one of the worst. In most of the cases there is always a delay. Minimum of 1 hour. There is no priority to families and people with assistance.

### “never again with Wizz”
By far the worst airline I have ever traveled with in my life! They consistently cause issues for passengers, either with check-in (€45 fine if not done electronically) or with luggage if it's not precisely the size they demand, weighed down to the gram, of course. And naturally, the delays of 2 and 2.30 hours every time. But never again with Wizz!

### "not accept the certificate of death"
Booked a ticket with Wizz air and had a death in the family and they did not accept the certificate of death because he died few days earlier than their rules. I asked at least to be refunded in the Wizz account so we can use it later but they refused.

### "Good value for money"
Ground staff at Abu Dhabi good, provided by Etihad. Boarding was fairly painless and via an airbridge which does slow the process down somewhat. Once onboard, constant reminders to take seats and not block aisles but ignored by many fellow passengers as they tried to swap seats with others as they clearly hadn't paid to sit togther; basics if flying a low cost carrier. Seats OK but any longer than 4 hours becomes uncomfortable. Crew OK and provided a good service. Their authority undermined on a couple of occasions when the seat belt sign was on for turbulence and pax just getting up and walking aroumd despite being asked to sit down. Disembarking was through front and back doors which meant a speedy process to the terminal. Flight was punctual and is the norm for this route. Good value for money.

### "staff was very friendly"
I usually book an emergency exit but this time I opted for a regular seat. I was surprised by how spacious it felt. Flights were on time and the Serbian staff was very friendly. The perfumes sold on the plane are 12% - 15% cheaper than those at Hamburg Airport. Only thing I would improve is their vegetarian sandwich which is a cheesy paste. It is edible and reasonably priced but not particularly tasty.

### “Horrible customer care”
This was the worst ever experience I have had in 18 years of travelling by air. I flew from Gatwick to Vienna and back the same day with a cabin approved hand luggage. The ground team in Gatwick was super helpful and effective however this cannot be applied to personnel in Vienna airport. The hand luggage I have been using for years and two most recent trips I have used was during Christmas interestingly using Wizz Air again and yesterday, I had no issues. However the ground staff in Vienna had decided that I suddenly have an incorrect luggage demanding me to pay 60EUR or I won't be able to board the plane. I was treated like I was less than human, suffering with physical health that was very much affecting my wellbeing due to their treatment. And when trying to explain this to the personnel handling the boarding I was told that my health was my problem and I should not worry about it. They refused to provide me their names and told me they did not have time to deal with me, I should pay and get on the plane otherwise I could stay in Vienna. I would never recommend anyone to fly by Wizz Air and especially from Vienna. Horrible customer care with no human manners. Absolutely poor communication skills and definitely not suitable for working with people. The two gentlemen should reflect and maybe change their roles where customer care is not needed to prevent more vulnerable passengers to become more ill just thanks to their inhuman approach.

### "recurring issues with this airline"
Wizz Air Flight W48372 on 30.01.2024, from Baku to Rome Fiumicino was delayed for more than three hours, it was supposed to depart at 23:15 and only departed the next day 31.01.2024 at 02:48. No apologies from any cabin crew member or the pilot were presented. I have recurring issues with this airline.

### "recent nightmare with Wizz Air"
Not Verified |  I want to share a recent nightmare with Wizz Air during my flight on January 25, 2024, from Paris BVA to Vilnius. Arriving over 3.5 hours early, I got blindsided by a sneaky 47 euros check-in fee at the counter—no warning from Wizz Air or Booking.com about this hidden charge. To make matters worse, I tried paying online for the airport check-in, being well within the 3-hour window. However, the website tricked me into paying for the return flight instead of the targeted one. When I called customer service, it cost me an extra 10 euros for an international call, and the staff's irresponsiveness and rude attitude with mixed opinions only added to the chaos. This deceiving website and extra fees ended up doubling my original cost to 148 euros instead of 87 euros. Beyond the financial hit, this experience ruined my trip. Wizz Air's lack of transparency, hidden fees, and unhelpful customer service are inexcusable.

### "I really like Wizz Air"
I really like Wizz Air and feel that they come in for a lot of unnecessary criticism. The aircraft are relatively new, the seats are comfortable, the onboard catering is good and very reasonably priced, there has always been plenty of space in the overhead lockers and I have found the cabin crew to be friendly and professional. I would choose this airline over their Irish rival whenever there is a choice. The only negative remark would be that it seems unnecessary to "board" a flight when the inbound aircraft has literally just landed when that involves herding the awaiting passengers into a corridor for an almost half-hour wait (in Gdansk.)

### “You get what you pay for”
Flight departed and arrived on time, boarding was efficient. Cabin crew did little speak to the passengers, they did the minimum only. Catering only at request because of the short flight time. Non-reclining seats, no charging facilities. You get what you pay for - low cost airline with simple service.

### "unpleasant and aggressive airline"
I bought a maximum of 10 kilos of luggage which looks like a cabin trolley on Wizz Air's website. When I got to the boarding gate, I was told that I would have had to check the luggage at check-in, so my options where to pay 55 euros or leave the suitcase there. The luggage I bought was more expensive than Wizz Air priority, so the attitude of the employee was, to say the least, too intransigent. She treated me as if I had committed a serious offence. It's not the first time I've come across Wizz Air boarding staff who are very unfriendly, cold, distant and incapable of any kind of empathy. I had an unpleasant start to my holiday. The company's website is designed to confuse customers. The staff who work for the worst low-cost airline of Europe and proximities are sinister. The employee refused to show her name and moved her ID so it couldn't be seen. Another extremely unfriendly employee sent me to the back of the queue and said that they hadn't to show their names. She also moved the identification around my neck. If it weren't for the routes it serves in Eastern Europe, I would never set foot on this truly unfriendly, unpleasant and aggressive airline.

### “Online check in service not available”
Not Verified | Online check in service is not available and they send me email telling to be at the airport early so that we can do the self check in but upon checking in they let us pay for the self check in telling us pay or you will not fly.

### "a really bad experience"
Not Verified |   If you're thinking about booking a flight with Wizz Air, I'd say think again. I just had a really bad experience with their customer service. It was probably the worst I've ever seen. When I had a tricky situation with my travel, they weren't helpful at all and their communication was really confusing. In my case, Wizz Air's customer support was way below what you'd normally expect. So, if you want to avoid a lot of stress and hassle, especially when things go wrong, you might want to choose a different airline. From what I went through, it seems like saving a few bucks on tickets with them might end up costing you a lot more in terms of trouble and frustration.

### "made us pay 170 AED per bag"
Not Verified |   We booked a trip to Medinah with Wizz Air airlines at Abu Dhabi airport. They are a budget airline, we did get cheap tickets but trust me when I say this, they will try any other way to pull money out of you like what me and my relatives experienced. Nowhere while booking and checking in did we see clearly that we cannot take a trolley bag as a carry on. All that was mentioned was the size and the weight. They made us pay 170 AED per bag and that’s how they made up for being a budget airline. When we said that it wasn’t written anywhere CLEARLY, they had the audacity to say read terms and conditions. I have to mention here how rude the employees were to us. Also, In this day and age I’ll be honest with you all, who actually reads terms and conditions? All they could do was just mention along with the size and weight that we cannot carry a trolley bag but honestly I think they won’t because how else will they pull money? Really disappointed with this experience and I haven’t even boarded the flight yet. So anyone reading this particular review, please carry a bag pack with you to avoid paying 170 AED.

### “they simply didn’t care”
Not Verified | It’s so bad! First time we used Wizz, we were quite happy because for a low cost flight all went well. This time the boarding was always delayed more then 40minutes, in both ways AD-ROMANIA and ROMANIA-AD. Apart of that I’m flying pregnant, with a 3 year old with me and they do not even have used the priority properly, they simply didn’t care in both ways. And the worst thing is, in both ways we did check in at the counter and they didnt even care to mantain the 3 of us together, knowing a 3 year old will just probably cry at some point, and I believe they do this to charge you the extra 45€ per persone so you check in online. RIDICULOUS AIRLINE, nothing should make me fly away of my daugther and husband with her age. If you use the priotity properly you also could use it to prioritize kids with parents. This is a sin, haram to everything who touches family. God forbid you. I will do all in my control to not fly with you again.

### "the service is the worst"
Wizz Air forces its customers to check-in at the airport because of a not working app and a not working website and then charges them $59 to check-in at the airport. I booked a flight from Basel to Budapest leaving at 14:40 on December 26th, 2023. I tried to check-in on Wizz Air website from my phone at 9:00 the same day. It redirected me to a blank page the 3x I tried. Then I tried to check in at 11:45 on the Wizz Air app. The check-in was "closed" on the app. So my only option was to check-in at the airport. They charged me 49 CHF (~54€ ~$59) as fees to check-in at the airport. I showed the app and the website not working properly to the airport staff which didn't want to listen and wave the fees. I was not the only passenger in the queue for which one the app and website didn't work. They told me they had to check-in from a laptop because it was not working from their phone. On top of that the service is the worst I ever had to face and the staff is awful. The staff received me so badly, insinuating I was the problem not the app.

### "extremely unprofessional"
Not Verified | The worse air company ever. Flight postponed to next day without comments or explanations. Staff clueless and extremely unprofessional. They have no idea what happens with the checked in luggages when the flight is delayed. Never fly with Wizz Air! If you want reliability and professionalism do not choose Wizz Air.

### “disorganized and stressful flight”
The outbound flight from Luton to Amman on the 24th was a pretty disorganized and a stressful flight. At Luton Airport, Wizz Air management starts boarding passengers through the gate when the aircraft isn’t there. In turn theres 237 passengers jammed in a single area, on board (LTN-AMM) the crew were very attentive and energized, However the hype for Christmas was also uncomfortable as they kept making announcements every 10 minutes on a evening/night flight when everyone was already tired. I would suggest Wizz Air to at least make their Amman service a more comfortable flight since its a 6h one. On the way back on the 1st - the flight was much better mainly because there were less passengers. A crew member on the aircraft was specifically very rude with my family. We thought to ourselves she may just be tired, therefore we didn’t really say anything. However that wasn’t an excuse to constantly speak in a negative manner. I can’t complain much in the sense that Wizz Air does its job as a budget airline but there’s some management concerns which the airline should address to make the experience a bit more human. Being budget doesn’t mean that you should expect a negative experience I would also say that the onboard menu prices are just inhumane. £5 for a cheese baguette which is 10cm in length? - no thanks. On a 7h flight water should be standard as well I booked my tickets 6 weeks in advance and paid almost 250£ per passenger on a flight which is usually 50£. So it was rather expensive. But anyone traveling off season on this route I think it’s worth it.

### "Avoid at all costs"
I’ve travelled with Wizz Air countless times without any issue. That is why they felt like a safe choice for a christmas getaway. Unfortunetly, this experience turned out to be disasterous. The flight was scheduled to leave BUD at 6:35 PM. Around 15 minutes before boarding, the gate number dissapeared and a delay of 8.5 hours appeared. Staff told us to wait for more infos. At 9PM, they told us that the flight for sure will leave at 3AM, and that we should stay at the airport and wait instead of going home and coming back later. They also promised that there will be staff at the Service Desk at all time to assist us and answer our questions. It is currently 3:40AM, the flight has since been delayed 2 times again, and there hasnt been a single staff member at the service desk since 10PM, thus it is impossible to get any information about the situation. Im not even mad anymore about the delay, only about the complete lack of customer service that is present in Wizz Air. Its actually terrifying how much they dont care about their passangers. Avoid at all costs.

### “they will charge you a lot of fees”
Not Verified |  You will pay for a cheap price upon booking the ticket in their website. However, upon checking in at the airport, they will charge you a lot of fees! Also, they will let you check in online and they will not even assign seats next to each other. So me and my husband had NO CHOICE but to sit far from each other which is very inconvenient! Not in my life I flew with an airline that lets you seat apart from the same person who you booked the ticket with and same PNR. Not flying with this airline again.

### "I am not flying with them again"
I am not flying with them again after paying 60 euros for Wizz Priority, and when arriving to the gate, there was no priority boarding - there was one single queue. I paid for a service I didn't receive, and I didn't need to have paid, as my trip experience would have been the same. In addition, paid 15 euros to be seated together. When entering the plane, the cabin crew told us we couldn't seat in our allocated seats. Again, why pay for a seat and then be denied that seat?! When we mentioned we would like to be seated in the seats we paid for, she was incredibly rude. On a side note, I have also never seen a dirtier plane: the floor was totally black in the seats where we were 'forced' to seat, and it smelled.

### “Wizz Air does not take responsibility”
I have uploaded herein the e-mail sent by Wizz Air with the instructions of our flight and not the boarding ticket. You will read below the reason. We were an hour before the flight at the airport of Milan, that is 6.40, and the flight was at 7.40 in the morning! And we were denied boarding because "we were one hour before and not 2,5!". As you can see in the instructions, they had no right to deny us boarding, but not only they did, the Wizz Air service does not take responsibility, blaiming the Milan airport! We had no other choice but to buy tickets from another airline to return home, which told us that what Wizz Air did was illegal. You cannot deny boarding an hour before the flight while we have tickets and baggages paid and checked-in. Definitely would not travel again, definitely nor recommend it, and definitely will write everywhere about it, until we get all our money back!

### “crew did the minimum”
The flight was fine and passed quickly, more or less comfortable, crew did the minimum, still practical, generally clean plane, boarding staff at Tirana need manners.

### “Cabin crew was polite”
Early boarding, had to wait on stairs until aircraft was ready. Flight on time, arrived 10 minutes ahead the schedule, luggage claim took 10 minutes. Cabin crew was polite, flight was efficient but not luxurious.

### "make you pay even for check-in"
First and last time booking Wizz air. Maybe it’s cheaper initially but they will make you pay even for check-in 190 aed, if you didn’t do it online prior. They don’t send an email coz obviously for that you have to pay as well. It never ever happened to me with another airline ever before. Utterly disappointed, but obviously it’s a cheap airline, they have to get the money somewhere and cheat people wherever possible. Let’s see what else will happen.

### "never fly this airline again"
I arrive at Larnaca airport, go to the check-in counter, and they charge me 105 euros for the checkin. The ticket was 75 euros. The bottom line is. Low-costers aren't really low costing. I will never fly this airline again. it's a rip off and daylight robbery. There's no food or water,  well, there's nothing really and the seats are not reclining. How is this possible that the check-in at the airport is more expensive than the ticket

### "pleasant flight with Wizzair"
Flight departed 25 minutes late, cabin crew was friendly, arrival with bus transfer, after around 35 minutes we left the airport with our checked-in luggage collected. A short and pleasant flight with Wizzair.

### "flights have been very good"
The boarding was very friendly and organized at Malaga airport. I had Priority Boarding and managed to be the first one on the plane. It was a full plane, but it didn't feel overbearingly full. The pilot and cabin crew were there to welcome me on board, together with some good humour. The leg-room pitch was pretty decent for this route time (3.5 hours) and better than some of the other low-cost carriers I have flown with. The plane felt like it was brand spanking new - always a good sign for a nervous flyer such as myself. There was the option to purchase food and drinks, but I had a Spanish empanada in my stomach and a bottle of water. There was a slight delay in arriving to Vienna (20 minutes) but the flight left on time so there must have been some strong head winds. All in all, given that it was a low-cost flight, I have to give 10/10 for this trip. Actually, all of my Wizz air flights have been very good.

### "the most horrible I have experienced"
Horrible service, I wouldn’t repeat to take this airline even if it is free. 2 days before our flight they moved it 14 hours later. Our hotel and tours were already set up and we have to cancel the tour and get charged by the hotel for a day. In order to check in early, you need to purchase seats so we did because as per their website it says that they will not accept mobile boarding form. Boarding is not organized, no zones, no priorities so anyone can just go which makes it also difficult to board. Some of the staff are rude and they treat people like they are on the streets and not in the customer service industry. I understood that this is a budget airline but treating people like this is not acceptable. One of the flight attendants on our flight during boarding we reached our seat and were putting up our luggage so some of the passengers were waiting behind us instead of helping us at least to put up the luggage he was shouting and swerving us with his hand to the side telling us “let them pass!, let them pass!”, no manners at all, like really!?. It is not my first time to fly with budget airlines but this by far the most horrible I have experienced! So before taking this airline think first about it. It is cheap yes, but there are extra fees and weird requirements like printing the boarding card to be shown at the airport instead of flight ticket and mind you if you choose airport check-in there is payment also.

### "claimed that we cancelled the flight"
Not Verified |  Wizz Air stopped flying to and from Israel when a war started on October 7. They sent us a refund of $100 when the full cost was $500 for the 2 tickets. When we contacted them, they claimed that we cancelled the flight. I explained that we didn't and still want to go when flights are available. At that point they said the decision is final and stopped responding to email. Their phone support is useless and just refer you the online form.

### "behave very badly with the passengers"
Very bad experience with Paris Beauvais Airport and Wizz Air service! Workers of the airport and wizz air are very rude, impolite, behave very badly with the passengers. The airport must refuse to have these kinds of workers. Would never recommend flying from or to Paris Beauvais Airport with Wizz Air.

### "rudest and most unprofessional staff"
The rudest and most unprofessional staff ever! They made me pay 230zł (About 55 US$) for 7cm bag size difference! I am allowed as per my ticket with a carry on bag, mine was literally 7 cm higher than their metal measure (Despite those 7 cm being empty air and malliable/pliable) since I have a soft bag-pack. I understand you make a person pay for 1kg extra or something, but 55$? Which is what any airlines charges for a 23kg bag 4 times the size of this bag! What's worst is they never checked anyone else for the bag size, despite passengers holding bigger bags that mine. Their answer was "They have air priority", despite them knowing these passengers were coming in from the same line I came in, not the Priority lane. I asked to check anyone's bag to see if it fits in that impossible small size measuring pocket they have, they refused. Because they knew over 60% of those bags won't pass that test! Then when it came to payment, they don’t accept Euro, Not USD, & didn't accept 228zł & doesn't accept 300zł because they have no change, which is literally 2zł less than the Crazy number they wanted to charge, an amount I could've used to travel with any other decent airline (which I will from now on! ).

### "Terrible service"
Terrible service. I was forced to buy a ticket which included priority boarding and extra luggage, neither of which I needed, even though it was not included in my outbound ticket (both were bought together). No flight updates when departure is delayed. I complained and the response was a random sentences copied and pasted which had nothing to do with my complaint. In the second reply they said I had no right to complain and the argument used to support it was they they broke they own rules (i.e. admitted I was right)

### "don’t cooperate with other airlines"
I booked a ticket for my mum (citizen of Cyprus) from Vienna to Dubai with a two hour stop in Riyadh (Saudi-Arabia). As she arrived in Riyadh she had to pay an entry Visa to Saudi-Arabia and go through the immigration area, get her checked baggage and check herself again in for her next flight on another airline. The whole situation ended up with the chaos that she couldn't reach her next flight and we had to buy her a new ticket to Dubai. She needed special assistance and the service was stopped in Saudi Arabia so we had to make international phone calls to Saudi to ask for the service again. Obviously Wizzair is so cheap that they don’t cooperate with other airlines to let you reach your destination country smoothly but it will end up for you to have Stress and do everything double.

### “This airline is an absolute fraud”
This airline is an absolute fraud! We had booked a flight with them last summer, only to have our flights cancelled last minute. We were already travelling in another country and were in Venice in summer - not a cheap place to be stranded. We called their Customer Support and were told that we'd be put on the next available flight IN 4 DAYS. We were told that ALL expenses would be paid (as they have to by law) - we clarified several times on this phone call if there was a limit and she said no, as long as not 5* accommodation. Fair enough, so we paid everything out of pocket for 4 days and send the receipts to Wizz Air afterwards. This company has been refusing to pay up and only reimbursed us about 20% of our costs - they deem 336 EUR for 2 people for 4,5 extra days in Venice reasonable. That is 42 EUR per person, per day. In Venice. In summer. For accommodation, food and transportation. We have reached out multiple times requesting to be paid the remaining expenses we incurred due to their flight cancellation AND HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER. They say to go through the ODR, which we did - they had 3 months to respond and never did. Please listen to the original call that was made with your customer support and pay up as you had said you would. So yeah, if you would like to fly with an airline that will leave you stranded on vacation for four days, not reimburse you and then ignore you, definitely go with Wizz Air.

### "Just don't fly with Wizz Air"
Not Verified |  I flew Wizz Air from Suceava to Luton three months ago. My baggage, along with around 20 other passengers was not loaded onto the plane. We arrived in Luton and mobbed the arrivals carousel and eventually a wizzair person arrived and said that the pilot was supposed to tell us that our baggage wasn't here. Obviously, he hadn't done that. The poor ground handler did not explain the importance of a PIR (Property Irregularity Form) and that it had to be filled out at the airport terminal. The website does not explain that properly. Of course, that form is not available online and has to be filled out at the airport of arrival. i had to stay two extra days in London (with all of the costs incurred) and I live in Australia and of course Wizz Air does not fly to here. Two days later, I went in a taxi back to Luton Airport to collect my delayed baggage. The ground handlers did not explain the need for a PIR and I flew back to Australia. In order to try and recoup the expenses incurred, I tried the call centres. They call are no help as they say you have to physically go to the airport you arrived at. God help you if you are trying to navigate a fatal accident, or serious injury. I am around USD5k in the hole thanks to them. Just don't fly with Wizz Air.

### "the most unprofessional airline"
Not Verified |   Wizz Air is the most unprofessional airline in the world. They have cancelled my flight without any notice and refuse to provide me with a refund. When I call them, they say they have already issued a refund but when I ask for proof of transfer, they tell me to send an email and wait for a reply within 1-2 months. I went ahead and sent an email to which the auto-reply from their end was for me to contact their customer service on the phone! Their only aim is to scam people, steal their money and then ghost them so that they do not have to provide the money back. I have no idea how this airline is still operating to be honest.

### "service was friendly and helpful"
The flight and check in went well. I paid for the auto check in service and was given seat 15a at the window. If I had known that the seat would have a painful lack of cushioning and that my knees would be pressed into the seat in front I would have paid the £26 for an extra legroom seat. I didn't have that issue with the seat inbound so I suspect it is the window seat plus a broken seat that caused my difficult journey. The flight was full so there was no opportunity to swap seats so I didn't complain about the seat to the flight attendants. As the two people on the outer seats fell asleep almost immediately (and I didn't want to wake them up) I put up with it. I wonder what if anything the FA would do. The service was friendly and helpful from what I have seen. For example, one woman had a large rolling bag that was too wide for the overhead, he assisted her to reduce its shape by using the zipper. I can only recommend this airline to people who are under 5'8 otherwise it's a significant risk of a poor seat for the journey which in my case was 3.5 hours.

### “Stay away from this airline”
Stay away from this airline. They are scammers and thieves. They make it impossible for you to check in online so that later, they can charge you an arm and a leg when you have to check in at the airport. Also, my husband had to check in his luggage because we had purchased some beautiful Swiss knives, and what do you know. They were missing out of our luggage when we got to our hotel. We have tried everything we can to try to reach out to the airline and it is damn near impossible. When we try to the phone number online, it automatically disconnects us. When we try to chat with someone on their website, we’re just talking to a robot. We’ve been trying to figure out how to file a claim online and there is absolutely nothing we can do. This airline has cost me hundreds of dollars.

### "The flight was uneventful"
My first encounter with wizzair was with the iPhone app. It is solid, provides many services ancillary to the flight - such as history of flight landing - and allows you to book extra service after the booking. The booking process via the iPhone app was smooth. The charges are transparent, though I don't like how high the bag cost is, so I can compare it with the competition. I generally go with an underseat bag now, whether Ryanair or Wizzair; Aer Lingus alone gives you checked bag included in the low cost seat. Wizzair advised me to turn up 3 hours before departure due to security queue, and I am glad I did as it was a slow process of handling thousands with only 60% x-ray machine operating. We boarded 40 minutes before departure, but took off an hour later. The seats are the most limited in knee room of any of the LCC and this early boarding accentuated this - can you tell I am 6ft? The £10 charge for keeping the booking seats together leads to friends reuniting in the interval before takeoff. I was asked to swap by an attendant to a worse seat which I refused, later I was offered free extra legroom seat. The teens who had paid for these seats weren't allowed to occupy them. I bought a meal and the brioche ham cheese was good, large water and chocolate for £7 The flight was uneventful, on time and I give credit to the flight staff for their good humour.

### "simple and efficient flight"
Flight delayed by 35 minutes, arrived in time. Priority boarding respected. Cabin crew was polite and willing to help. No facilities for charging or tv screen, catering for sale, did not ask for anything. It was just a simple and efficient flight

### “Terrible customer service”
A dishonest company which recuperates money any way it can. Doesn’t end up being low cost at all. I'm not one for reviews but this was too much. Terrible customer service. Not at all responsive and accommodating. They charged me an extra 48 euros on the day of the flight because I hadn't been able to check in online. Not Verified | Their application wasn't working. I tried several times. Although they understood that the error was theirs (other travelers told me that the online check-in platform often has glitches and that this inconvenience has happened to others), they wouldn't listen and charged me for a simple on-site check-in. They then told me to file a claim for a refund. The response I got to my request for reimbursement of expenses (with an explanation of the facts and a handwritten invoice as proof) was: an automatic "noreply" e-mail sending me the invoice. I'll never travel with this company again. Worst experience I have ever had with an airline.

### “Cabin crew polite but not friendly”
Flight delayed for more than an hour, boarding a little bit chaotic (priority boarding was announced but everybody was allowed to board). Cabin crew polite but not friendly. Food on board for sale but not everything on the menu was available. Stewardess was inpatient in explaining details.

### "Awful service with rude employees"
Not Verified |  Awful service with rude employees. Charged us 88 euro to check in because we couldn’t check in on line, as we were travelling and driving from a place in France with no internet connection. They did not tell us flight was delayed 2 hours and we could have checked in at the airport online. Of course the poor service continued on the flight as well. Stay away from this Airline.

### "were denied boarding"
Three passengers (including me) could not be found in the record and therefore were denied boarding despites being checked in online (which we paid for). Wizz Air don't have their own staff on the ground and use a 3rd party company for check-in. Which means that any problem that occurs can not be solved by this staff. We called the service center and waited 50 minutes before talking to someone. So we all missed our flight. The customer service reps are extremely rude and won't hesitate to hung up on you (yes, it happened twice). The only way to ask for a refund is through their website by email only. It takes one month to get a response, and they will ask for documents that we were told about (such as a denied boarding form).

### "nothing short of a nightmare"
Not Verified |  My recent flight experience with Wizz Air was nothing short of a nightmare. I was shocked to discover that there was an additional fee for boarding at the counter, a cost that was never mentioned on my ticket or the airline's website. This lack of transparency is unacceptable and left me feeling cheated. The behavior of the boarding staff was utterly disrespectful and unprofessional. Their rudeness towards passengers was unwarranted and created a hostile atmosphere during the boarding process. To make matters worse, when I submitted nine passports for our group's boarding, we were issued with only seven boarding passes. The counter staff simply closed the counter, leaving two of our group members stranded at the airport, with no alternative but to wait an entire day for a flight change. My overall experience with Wizz Air was marred by these significant issues. I sincerely hope that Wizz Air takes immediate action to address these problems, as no passenger should have to endure such a frustrating and distressing travel experience. I strongly advise potential travelers to exercise caution when considering this airline for their journeys.

### "The aircraft is extremely dirty"
Not Verified |  Delays as usual, the gate is changing in the last minute, no information provided, arrived in the airplane 1 hr later then suppose. The aircraft is extremely dirty.

### "Worst service ever"
The restrictions about baggage size and numbers are very tight, had to buy priority ticket for what we usually able to take as a hand luggage for free. If you don't check in online three hours before the departure you will have to pay for the registration 45 eur for a person. There's no clear indication about that during the buying process so for many people it was a surprise when they got to the counter. Worst service ever. Considering the nuances above you can buy tickets from almost any other company and it will be better price and better service for less money.

### "most unreliable company ever"
Not Verified |  The most unreliable company ever. Knew about cancelation 3 hours later after check in. No representative to answer only airport staff who is claiming that they don't know anything! Terrible experience. Called to call center but useless! Will not ever use this again.

### "A very disgusting experience"
A very disgusting experience. Seats hard like on a bus, for a 6 hours flight. All boarding-exiting via remote stands and bus with long bus rides. Both flights had an extremely strong smell of human excrement on board. I don't know if it's due to the fact that Wizz Air flushes their aircraft less often than other airlines to save money, but I haven't experienced that on any airline regardless of the aircraft model and I've frequently flown the A321, hence it's not an equipment issue. Both aircraft very dirty with no cleaning done between the flights. Glitchy app often forcing customers to pay for airport check-in. Fly with Wizz Air only if you have no other choice or if they're dirt cheap.

### "Do not recommend"
The only thing reliable about this airline is that there will be delays. Do not make any time dependent plans of your day of travel as you will not be able to know if your flight is 1h or 5h delayed until you touch down on the runway. The worst part is the the absolute disregard for customer respect. They will not apologize for delays or keep you updated on why or how long the delay will be. After boarding 1.5hrs late, the plane did not start moving for 1h without a single piece of information from the crew. You will feel like your on a cattle transport rather than an airplane. Do not recommend

### "suggest avoiding this airline"
I would strongly suggest avoiding this airline at all costs. The low upfront cost is a bait and switch, you will be hit with random charges that will likely surpass regular airline cost for a lower service.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. Constantly late, rude staff and are now lying to airhelp about paying compensation. My pregnant wife had to sleep on the floor as the flight did not arrive until 4am. Compensation offered was 4 euros. I am disgusted.

### "Hardly a low cost airline"
Not Verified |  They find unbelievable ways to make you pay for everything. Hardly a low cost airline. It is all about profiteering. What a shame!

### "I would recommend"
Very okay experience. Leg space is narrow, food for purchase is just ok. But staff is very nice and professional. The ticket price was excellent value. And yes, this flight was delayed by an hour. But I would recommend.

### "nothing short of appalling"
Wizz Air's handling of our recent flight from Nice to London Gatwick was nothing short of appalling. The flight was delayed by a whopping 5 hours, departing at 2:15 am instead of the scheduled 9:15 pm, with a pitiful EUR 4 compensation offered. When all the shops closed at 11:00pm no Wizz Air staff were in sight to provide any food or water. What's worse, there was zero communication from Wizz Air throughout this ordeal. The staff, from check-in to the gate, were not only unhelpful but also incredibly rude when passengers sought information about the delays. No updates were provided about the reasons for the delays or when the flight would actually take off. Wizz Air's treatment of passengers during this experience was shameful. They failed to meet basic expectations of courtesy and transparency during a significant disruption. They are black list in my books and I would warn anyone from considering with them.

### "an absolute disgrace"
Not Verified |  My first and last time flying Wizz Air, an absolute disgrace from start to finish. Flying from London to Kosovo was a 5 hour delay and flying from North Macedonia back to London is a 3 hr delay. Still waiting. No one at the counter to give information get sent to airport information who send you back to WIZZ AIR. Whilst their lower price may be attractive you spend more money trying to correct this airline’s unreliability with plans you have made whilst delays may occur.

### "suggest everyone not to fly Wizz Air"
Apparently they don’t allow transits even if you have valid transit visa and this is not mentioned anywhere except if you fine read their terms and conditions on the website. I suggest everyone not to fly Wizz Air unless you have tourist visa or citizenship of that country you’re flying to. Also, someone told me food is bad but I didn’t get a chance to try that.

### "The biggest mistake of my travelling life"
Not Verified |  Had a great experience at airport, the staff employed by the airport and restaurants were really friendly and helpful 10/10. Unfortunately, we had booked with Wizz Air. The biggest mistake of my travelling life. Made to pay for hand luggage by a nasty little guy who seemed to enjoy making passengers pay for hand luggage (the same hand luggage that was entirely acceptable to Wizz Air on the outward journey). He informed us rules had changed but provided no evidence - this in my opinion is simply a money making scheme and I certainly wont be visiting Budapest again which is a great shame as we loved the place.

### "biggest let down for Hungary"
Not Verified | Disgraceful, greedy airline. No frills does not mean take advantage of your passengers. I should’ve read other reviews first before booking. Despite being no frills, they could still treat customers with respect. The biggest let down for Hungary!

### "we paid for 5 cabin bags"
Not Verified |  The problem started with the booking. They were not explicit they gave measurement of cabin baggage without specifying it was for priority passengers only and they did did not mention during booking that if you do not do online check in you will have to pay. We ended having to argue with the uncompromising check in staff and we paid for 5 cabin bags. I would like to mention here we paid in Turkish liras at a very inflated exchange. Their call centre is total disgrace snd utterly useless.

### "the least reliable of the LCC flying in Europe"
As most people stated in here, Wizz Air is the least reliable of the LCC flying in Europe. Yes they do have very good prices but be prepared for last minute schedule changes, and 1,2,3 hours delays. At Oporto the staff did not even care to announce gate change, people were lost and confused. The planes are brand new so cleaning and conservation is not an issue now. When booking them try to get the fare with carry on as if you add it later it can be as expensive as the flight itself. I will keep flying them as long as the price is very low.

### "by far the least reliable carrier"
Not Verified | Wizz is by far the least reliable air carrier I ever used. From the last three flights I took with them, all of them were delayed. And not "ten-twenty minutes delayed", several hours delayed. It has become so standard, staff doesn't even apologize anymore. I feel sorry every time I book them because I know it will be a shower, sadly some routes fly direct only with them. The worst airlines, the worst service. Period.

### "Customer service is not a priority"
Not Verified | Departure airport: Faro Airport, FAO Scheduled departure time: 18/08/2023 9:15 PM Actual departure time: 19/08/2023 00:24 Arrival airport: London Gatwick Airport, LGW I took the above flight with Wizz Air after a three hour and 14 minutes delay and when I contacted them to raise a customer service query I was told, you can't claim or complain as we landed 2:33 minutes after the original arrival time! That gives you an idea of the customer service approach. As it turns out, they knew the day before the departure that the flight would be severely delayed but didn't bother to let the customers know until hours before checking in so you can't change flights. Customer service is not a priority and that became apparent by the enormous charges they apply on calls to customer services. Ryanair can learn some lessons in how to rinse customers! I gave them a 1 rating as zero is not available.

### "in 2 months my flight was changed twice"
Not Verified |  Cea mai de rahat companie aeriana din toate cele care exista,in 2 luni mi-a fost schimbat zborul de doua ori ,daca vrei sa iei legatura cu ei,este imposibil ,am asteptat 45 minute sa vb cu cineva si nimeni nu a raspuns. - The worst airline out of all that exists, in 2 months my flight was changed twice, if you want to contact them, it is impossible, I waited 45 minutes to speak to someone and no one answered.

### "I will pay double just to be treated as a human"
On a flight that was to last 120 min. the "fasten your seat belts" sign stayed on for the first 90 minutes due to the alleged turbulence, which was not felt in the plane. I waited until I could afford, then rang the bell to go to the bathroom urgently. No one answered, so I took a few steps from my 34th row to the nearest toilet. At that moment all hell broke loose, the darkness and silence shattered by an authoritarian female voice ("this is not a drill" model) warning me to immediately return to my seat and threatening to have the police arrest me upon landing. I wish to have just disappeared at the astonished looks that showered me and returned to my seat, within five minutes the emergency sign was closed, the lights turned on, and the cabin crew started pulling trolleys between the rows some 20 minutes before landing. It was a night flight and my impression is that they didn't want to work unless truly necessary, at the cost of harassing passengers. I might fly Wizz Air again because of the convenient price, but if something like this happens again I will pay double just to be treated as a human. And yes, at the end they approached me to "apologize" because they thought I were pregnant (and still behaved as they did).

### “ Wizz Air is a complete joke!”
Not Verified |  Well, Wizz Air is a complete joke! The day before the flight, tried to complete online check-in, but it wouldn't let me without an account, which I didn't have. Being in the middle of a trip with limited internet, I decided to check-in at the airport. Check-in counter was scheduled to open 3 hours before the flight as per the information on the screen, so we lined up. An hour later, the check-in counter had still not opened. When it finally did, we waited another hour in line, only to be asked why we hadn't checked in when we got to the front. Above the counter where the giant words "Check-In"; the irony of not allowing people to check-in at the check-in counter was seemingly lost on all but the passengers who were redirected to a different counter, where we were charged 40 EUR PER PERSON to check-in. As far as I can tell all that happened at this second counter was a payment was made, and then we returned to the "check-in" counter 160 EUR lighter, to drop our bags (because we had now already checked in, at a different counter from the check-in counter). I won't ever fly this absolute trash airline again, and I'd advise you against it as well!

### “ no staff to explain what was going on”
The flight out of London was delayed by 2 hours, no explanation or apology. The first time any gate information came up in departure lounge it said "Gate Closed". This was an hour after the flight was scheduled to have departed and all the passengers were killing time waiting for a simple gate number. Panic!! Then at the gate was pandemonium - everyone waiting in line, no movement, no staff to explain what was going on. Return from Vienna to Gatwick was only half an hour late but trying to check in and get a boarding pass is nigh on impossible. I paid for a seat hoping that would materialise in a boarding pass. No such luck as when the bording pass did arrive in my email inbox it was a different seat from the one I had paid for. The Wizz Air app is as badly organised as the whole company.

### "worst experience of my life"
I arrived at the airport 2 1/2 hours prior to departure. Wizz had three flights leaving at similar times and only 3 staff on check in desk and only one automated desk working. By the time we checked in and got through security the gate had closed. Wizz air did not apologise and told me it would cost £430 to get on a flight the following day even though the issue was their lack of staff. Absolute joke of an airline. It cost me £700 to get a flight from Stansted. Absolutely the worst experience of my life stood at the gate with 3 children whose holiday had just been effectively cancelled. The lack of compassion or any attempt to help is deplorable.

### "Really bad experience"
Really bad experience. I have the Canadian passport and had to pay 40 JOD for a visa while I was was only transiting through Amman and not going out of the airport. There was no information at all from Wizz Air about this nor on the booking nor in the confirmation email. I didn't even have the amount on me so I had to borrow money from someone. I would not recommend this airline.

### "not find any check-in counter open"
Not Verified |  I did get a notification that my flight was moved from 18:45 to 21:00. I Arrived at 18:30 and could not find any check-in counter open. I could not even get the ticket. When I asked for general information, they pointed me to another empty counter. I lost 300 euros and don't even have access to their support.

### "cheated by a international airline"
The worst designed airline, first show basic price and then you have to pay on airport for check in and then hand luggage and then food in flight. If you calculate like this you can choose a good alternative airline, but never go to choose this airline . In my life traveled many countries but this was my first time got cheated by a international airline. Worst service

### "doesn’t follow their regulations"
Not Verified | I DO NOT recommend to buy a Wizz Air Discount! I bought, and there should be a discount 5euro if you buy online baggage. I compared the price when I’m not logged in and after when already my discount is active! And ATTENTION the price is the same, they think probably people are stupid that is why the company doesn’t follow their regulations and the of course there is no discount. Such a small thing, but better to choose Ryanair instead. Check screens I will add.

### "Wizz Air is the worst European company"
Wizz Air is the worst European company. I have flown with Wizz Air several times, regrettably. Every single time the flight gets delayed. Often it is cancelled last minute. On one occasion, the flight got cancelled as I was boarding and was on the stairs to get in. Contacting customer service by phone call costs you more than the ticket. Baggage drop off takes from one to two hours. Seats are uncomfortable and small.

### "rescheduled three times with a very short notice"
I travelled from Athens to London and back again with WizzAir. It was my first experience with the airline and will definitely be my last. My first flight (from Athens to London) was rescheduled three times with a very short notice. Later I was told by other customers that this is the norm with WizzAir. The worst part was my return flight to Athens. Not only the flight was delayed and rescheduled two times, but till the very last minute the flight was not even mentioned on the departures board. Once we got to the gate of our already delayed flight (00:40 instead of 22:05), the airlines’ stuff was measuring each and every passenger’s bag and made at least have of them pay mostly for a size difference of 2-3cm. That caused a huge extra delay and frustration to the exhausted passengers. If that wasn’t enough, at some point the staff told us that our flight would be postponed for an hour more (!) and we’d have to go back and wait again for another gate to be announced. Finally, when we went to the second gate, there were extra delays as there was only one employee to check all the passengers’ passports. When we got on the plane we had to wait for almost half an hour for them to load the baggage. We arrived in Athens at 6:35 instead of 3:55, just on time for them to not have to pay us the legal refund of a 3 hour delay.

### "Flight was cancelled"
Flight was cancelled. We had to reschedule all of our connecting flights alone and at our cost (700€). The only answer the guy gave us on the phone : we are not responsible for your other flights.

### "Wizz Air is the worst airline"
Wizz Air is the worst airline in the area. The plane was supposed to depart at 9:15 pm on 16 August. It was delayed and no one provided any further information. Later it was announced to depart at 2:55 am on 17th August, with over 5 hours of wait at the airport, then they told passengers that now the flight will be at 7:45 am. No hotel was given to sleep, no refreshments, no food, no information if passengers should go home or stay at the airport. There are many cancellations and delays if you see them by the airline. This airline should not be operating at all. Should be shut down.

### "first and last time"
Not Verified | Flight delayed by 9 hours. Lazy service which could not even bother to give us refreshments or water and even told the kids to go with the flow. It will be the first and last time to come here and fly with WIZZ

### "refused boarding at Gatwick"
Not Verified |  I will never fly with Wizz Air again. My wife, who is ill, and needs and oxygen concentrator was refused boarding at Gatwick, despite us sending details to the airline weeks in advance. We were left totally stranded as Wizz Air brutally turned us away with no alternative. All attempts to get help were in vain. We have also just been refused a refund of our flight cost. All other airlines we have travelled with have never had a problem taking an oxygen concentrator on board. Never fly with this airline.

### "rude and aggressive flight attendants"
Horrible service with very rude and aggressive flight attendants. Flight attendant refused to allow my tiny three year old granddaughter to use the bathroom after landing, claiming their rule is to lock the bathrooms after landing. In Wizz air there is no sense of hospitality or warmth with Wizz air, I have a flight booked with them for January which I am considering to cancel. I would prefer to pay more to a better airline than these people.

### "does a good job for the price"
Departed one hour later but it was not the airline’s fault, they completed the boarding in time. Cabin crew friendly, catering pay per product. Delay was 50 minutes at arrival. I still think Wizz does a good job for the price you are paying. They fly you from A to B in a simple way, no gadgets, no fancy things.

### "they denied me boarding"
Wizz Air overbooked the flight by 5 people. For of which couldn't board, me included. Then they forgot about our group at the airport. A woman in our little group of four hat a nervous breakdown and needed to be calmed down by the other passengers. 2h of discussions with the clerk: They can't provide any flight to Poland for the next week. They aren't responsible for the flight I missed from Warsaw to Vienna afterwards. They will only provide a hotel for one night if you take the flight they offer. Which they can't offer. So I had to pay my hotel myself. Had to book a flight myself. All the costs for transportation myself. Food myself. They ignore passenger laws, I filed two tickets with them by now. It's been 1 1/2 months and I haven't even seen the mandatory 250 EUR compensation they are legally required to pay and which they let us fill out a form for at the airport. Let alone all the costs for the flight itself. The clerk at the check-in said, they had multiple of those cases in the past week alone all from Wizz Air overbooking their flights. Wizz Air after 6 emails still even denies paying me back the cost for the ticket for the flight they denied me boarding to due to them overbooking it.

### "The worst company ever"
The worst company ever. I paid 2300 AED for tickets and there is no place for me and my son at the airplane! They are selling more seats that they have at the plane. And when I tried to submit the complaint - that's an endless story. Worst service ever!

### "Beware of this company"
48€ if you do not do the online check in. The company does not write this information on the ticket. They say they write it when you purchase the ticket. But I haven’t seen it. This means that you have to read even the small writing and every little detail when you book. They charge you 50€ if you bring a 10kg trolley on board. You can only take a backpack. I have never seen so many people complaining about penalties for weight and similar stuff. Beware of this company.

### "Worst, most unreliable company"
Never again. Worst, most unreliable company with non-existent customer service and zero accountability. Do not be fooled by low prices, you will end up losing money anyway, being force to wait in the airport for hours.

### "I feel like I’ve been tricked"
Not Verified |  I paid for 10kg luggage only to find out I paid for it to be checked in. What type of person checks in a 10kg bag. Rudest person at the gate told me I had to pay for my tiny bag that weighed less than 10kg costing me an additional almost £50. I feel like I’ve been tricked. I paid extra for seats and extra luggage, the app is not very clear. I suppose you pay for what you get these days.

### ""
Excellent flight, efficient boarding. Take off as scheduled, arrived 25 minutes ahead the scheduled time. I reserved premium seat (XXL - emergency exit) since I have privilege pass with them. Cabin crew polite and friendly, willing to help. I was very happy with Wizz Air.

### "a good experience"
Flying in Wizz Air was a good experience for me. The staff is very attentive, the flights were on time, the airplanes were clean and comfortable (taking into account it is an economy ticket). If you have kids under 14 they will be seated with an adult so there is not a problem regarding kids flying alone. Many people complain about this airline because it seems they pretend to have the benefits of flying first class with a famous airline but paying less. Of course, it does not have entertainment, and you have to pay for extras, etc.... But if you know you are paying less then you should have less expectations. It is what they sell, and I would definitely fly again with them.

### "$160 to check in at the airport"
Charged us $160 to check in at the airport after we already had airport check-in included in our ticket. Apparently, if you don't check-in online 3+ hours prior it's 48 euro PER PERSON to check in at the airport. What a joke of an airline.

### "staff were pretty unpleasant"
I flew return London-Prague with Wizz this weekend. Both flights were delayed, while still requiring original time-at-gate. The experience and excessive time-cost of flying with Wizz means I will not fly with them again. Delay-queue-delay-queue-be uncomfortable. Further to schedule delays substantial extra delays (and more queue's yay!) are caused on arrival by the use of bus to get to aircraft parked well away from actual terminals. The front toilet on the outbound flight was broken, and constant attempts to provide cabin service blocked access to the rear toilets causing a long queue and wait when people could finally access the toilet. The cabin staff were pretty unpleasant when we were further delayed 30 minutes prior to engine start on the return journey. There is tiny leg room, but manageable short-haul for most. I made the mistake of purchasing something off the menu - the pictures in no way represent what you will get! I'm really REALLY glad I didn't have my kids with me - the queue's and delays would have driven them crazy.

### "FA were helpful"
It was related to expectations and compliance with airline policy that was made to lower the cost and price. The check in was fast, considering there were 3 Wizz air flight at the same time. Flight was not on time. Boarding was smooth. FA were helpful and safety measures were good.

### "flights were delayed or cancelled"
The flight W43113 was supposed to take off at 19.40. At 18.40 they still did not provide the check-in info. At 19:00 they announced a 20 minutes delay Then 30 minutes Then 80 minutes - because of "weather conditions". The weather didn't seem to affect any other flight companies. Then 140 minutes delay. Then they changes the gate, from one corner of the airport to the opposite one. And then they announced the flight is cancelled. And then it is rescheduled, next day at 16.30 They said they will ask for hotel rooms, but it's not sure we'll get one. While waiting, all the wizz air flights that day were delayed or cancelled.

### "Check in took two hours"
Not Verified |  Check in took two hours and two phone calls at £71.80 call charges. Firstly my child’s DOB kept populating to a random date. Had to keep swapping from app to website then a phone call to amend . Secondly whizz air put booking under smithlawrence instead of smith-lawrence so another call to amend that as during check in you can’t amend the name. Not a good start. And very bitter at phone bill as I made £500 for to budget flights £50 for seat selection , £75 for baggage (one person only) and now this phone bill on top.

### "Relatively poor airline"
Flight delayed (3 hours) without a previous notice. Required to pay a 48 Euro fine for not being able to check in online prior to arriving at the airport. Unsatisfied from Wizz Air. Would not recommend to fly Wizz, Relatively poor airline.

### "No respect for customers whatsoever"
Not Verified | Just absolutely terrible airline. Our flight was delayed by 5 hours and all we got was a 8 euro voucher which was not enough for even a meal. Wizz Air is just a bad airline. No respect for customers whatsoever. They do not have any proper way of contacting any real person if you want to reach customer service. Would not recommend to anyone.

### "I would not recommend anyone"
The airline canceled my flight and now does not fly on this route Milan - Abu Dhabi. I received a letter that I can exchange or return funds to the Wizz Air account with a +20 percent bonus. But in fact, they want to refund me only in the amount of ‎3720.37 lei (and this is with a bonus), but I bought tickets for ‎5368 lei! The rest is fees that are non-refundable! But I also paid for them! It is possible to exchange the air ticket and the amount seems to remain full ‎5368 lei, but it cannot be done since it is impossible to change the airport of arrival and departure, the direction is canceled! In those support, they confirmed that there was no way to exchange and that they would return only 3720.37 lei. I consider this a scam! You canceled the flight and do not allow you to change tickets at full cost, even the airport of departure for Rome cannot be changed! Let me change air tickets at the full cost or return the full price to the account or card! You ruined my plans and stole money! I am very angry! I would not recommend anyone to buy flights from them.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible, disgusting, worst airline. Flights always delayed, minimum 3 hours. Plane dirty, cold air conditioner. Terrible customer service. Separate kids from parents seats on purpose, (with free seat near your child) so you will pay extra for choosing seats next time.

### "Very low quality service"
Not Verified |  System froze and we stuck 1 hour at the check in. The priority lane was slower than the regular one and was having one desk while the regular 3. The bus to reach the plane was overcrowded. The on board crew was fed up of the cabin luggages. We had our luggage between our legs because at at the check in it was not taken due to system breakdown. Very low quality service.

### "deeply disappointed and concerned"
I am deeply disappointed and concerned about the way I was treated by Wizz Air in regard to flight W64326, 27th July 2023, Eindhoven to Sofia. I have confirmed booking Wizz Go, with pre-paid and reserved seat, priority check-in at the airport and free airport check-in – 50’ before departure at Eindhoven Airport. I was not informed that the flight is overbooked, not asked if I would volunteer, no that I would be denied boarding by any means. The online check-in app was not working for whatever reason. I was at the check-in desk at 2 hours before departure, I got a boarding pass and dropped off my baggage. I was at the gate 30' before departure, it was obvious that the flight would be delayed, but there was no information in any way about new departure time and overbooking. The gate service did not asked me if I would volunteer, nor that I would be denied boarding. The flight was delayed more than 1 hour, when I was at the gate checking my boarding pass for boarding I was just ordered to step away and not allowed boarding without any explanation. When I insisted for information what was happening, the ground service girl just told me that Wizz Air had overbooked the flight and somebody else had taken my seat. I was ordered leave the gate and go to complain to Wizz Air. I was given no information what I have to do, where to go, what were my rights, just behaving rude and arrogant, ignoring. The way Wizz Air and gate service treated me put me on high emotional and physical stress, messed up my personal and working plans. I do not care about Wizz Air overbooking practice – it is a bad business practice, it is Wizz Air corporate decision, but I will take care about that for myself. I am much concerned and affected by the services not provided, thought paid, the “denied boarding” rules (if any) and the way ground staff gate service treat such cases – unprofessional, no basic skills about customer service - rude and arrogant. I have already placed a claim; however, I do believe that Wizz Air will do nothing to improve the service of boarding, including denied boarding practice. For the sake of fairness, the lady at the complains desk was quite professional and made arrangement in descent manner.

### "avoid this terrible company"
The worst company ever, the flight out we were delayed for 7 hours, we were told at the airport and by the captain when we boarded that the original plane had broken down in Cyprus, when we got home and tried to claim compensation we were told the issue was with air traffic control, they sent me an email stating [IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please note that, given the UK's exit from the European Union, as of 1 January 2021, people living in the UK (ie have a UK registered mail address) will not be able to use the European Commission online. Dispute resolution platform as an alternative dispute resolution body]. On the flight home the automatic check in we paid for did not work, also we paid for seat selection with extra leg room, a day before our flight they changed our seats to row 39 right at the back of the plane without extra leg room, when we boarded I had to ask the cabin crew for wet wipes to clean our seats as they had coke and food on them, so did the gentleman in front of us, the cabin crew stood there while we cleaned our seats, this was the first and last time I will ever use this airline, and I would advise everyone to avoid this terrible company.

### "Waste of time and money"
Awful service, flight was cancelled as we were at the gate of the airport due to one staff member feeling "ill". They make the compensation process so complicated to make a claim and they charge a fortune just to talk to someone on the phone. Waste of time and money, don't use this airline.

### "Do not fly with Wizz Air"
Cancelled my flight whilst at the airport 2 hours before I was due to fly and no prior notification. Tried to defer blame 3rd party travel agency for cancellation. Refunded all costs to a 3rd party travel agency even though some costs had been paid directly to Wizz Air via their website. Ground staff handed me a slip of paper with contact details to complain. Offered nothing - food/water or advice. Arrived at destination more than 12 hours late only after travel agency went out of their way to re-book me on another flight, even that was delayed by 2 hours. Nothing offered on the flight and crew were even ruder than ground crew. Spent more than 14 hours at the airport waiting for resolution and arrived at destination exhausted as had been awake for more than 24 hours. Do not fly with Wizz Air whatever the circumstance. Customer service refused any form of compensation even after landmark U.K. ruling that Wizzair had neglected customers.

### "the 10kg which was 65 EUR"
Not Verified |  Before the flight, I paid extra for priority check-in but when I got to the airport I was told there was no counter available for this so I was told to wait. After waiting for quite some time when I got there they told me my bag was 10 kg heavier. My bag was 30kg and I had bought 20kg for the cabin + 10kg for the plane. So I told them I have only one bag which is 30kg they said no it had to be 2 bags one 20kg and 1 10kg I said no problem, I will just take 10kg out of the bag and I will take them with me on the plane. I was told that I don't have time to do that and that if I don't pay the 10kg which was 65 EUR, I won't be able to board the flight. SO I had to pay 65E, but that's not all after all this they lost my bag and now they stopped answering my emails for the last 3 days.

### "£40 for not checking in online"
Not Verified | An absolute rip off. To charge customers £40 for not checking in online is day light robbery. Customer service then claimed they couldn't locate my file. Never had a worse experience.

### "Disgusting customer service"
Not Verified |  Disgusting customer service. Flight first delayed, then cancelled. Tried to rebook through their systems and was blocked via web, app, etc. Tried to call the customer service numbers both in italy and UK both did not work! SO tried with live chat agents, always busy and never replying. Then, they sent me a refund that i did not ask for, which is not enough for a new flight. I am yet to go back to the UK. Stuck in Italy.

### "This airline is pretty terrible"
Not Verified |  This airline is pretty terrible. I know you get what you pay for, but damn. They delayed our flight not once but three times in a row, and caused us huge headaches.

### "Worst airline in the world"
Worst airline in the world. Similar experience to many - couldn't check in online before flight due to system error and charged ridiculous amounts at airport to do so. Flight delayed. Subsequently found out they are officially worst for delays.

### "first and last time I fly with this airline"
Not Verified |  The first and last time I fly with this airline. I understand it is a low cost airline, but to not provide even water in a 6 hour flight is unbelievable. Besides the staff was full of attitude and didn't show a little gesture of kindness, at first I thought it was just bad luck with an employee, however after the second flight I understood it is a requirement to get hired, have no manners. The best happened when we landed in Dammam (Saudi Arabia), being around 240 people in the aircraft approximately 150-200 needed to get a connection flight; however, because the airline apparently doesn't have a contract with the airport, we were all obliged to pay EUR130 for a transit visa, even though none of us would step in the country. This was absolutely ridiculous and we got the explanation from the local authorities that they daily faced that issue of people flying with WizzAir. Nothing was ever explained in the reservations email, which should have been detailed even prior of making the booking. As per my experience it was a given that when you are flying internationally and have everything ready for your next flight you just have to cross de "International transfer" door at the airport, however Wizz Air had a wonderful surprise for us. I was lucky and did not miss my flight, but I will definitely pay extra next time to travel with a decent airline.

### "Absolute joke of a company"
Not Verified |  AVOID IF YOU CAN!! Absolute joke of a company. First time flying with them. We were due to depart form Baku to Rome around 14:20. Not only the flight was delayed and we almost missed the connecting flight but the online check in link also did not work. Tried checking in the night before twice and the morning of (5 hours prior) the flight, but still the link did not work and notified that we need go to the gates. Which when we did they heavily insisted that we had to pay 120 euro for Airport check- in and if not they refused to give us their ticket. The employee also insisted that he was not a Wizz Air employee but he had the right to demand such payments on the company's behalf also refused to give us any info on how to contact Wizz Air and refused to call anyone from Managerial level. We checked the website and is stated that if links did-not work airport check-in will be free but the employee insisted this is not the case and that we had to pay as there was no other choice if we wanted to fly. We have been trying to contact them for the past 2 days now. The phone numbers do not work and they charge crazy for them. Online chat is also brushing off all the options that you select and refuses to connect to a live agent. I have contacted them though other socials as well but just from the Instagram comments I can see that I will never get any answer or refund. Again if possible do not fly with them, better off paying a bit more for other decent airlines, since Wizz is still going to scam you out of the money you saved by booking with them. Hope this review helps someone.

### "need to pay 130 euro to check in"
Not Verified |  We tried to check in using the app and were unsuccessful 3 times. Then tried to use the web base check in with no success. Once we got to the airport stood in line for 50 mins only to be told we were told we had to speak to airport service so that they can rectify the fact that the app did not allow us to check in. Given we did not know to take screen shots the service representative told us we should have proof and would need to pay 130 euro to check in. Or call the whizz customer service portal. We tried to call them for which the charge was 1 euro per ‘min and yet again the app did not work. We tried to show the airport customer service representative that nothing was working only to be told they cannot help and we must pay the amount or miss our flight. This was totally unhelpful. This is absolutely unacceptable and leave a bad taste both with regards to the airline and more so with the airport authorities.

### "delayed for over 4 hours"
My flight from Bucharest to Copenhagen was delayed for over 4 hours, which made me not only missed my next flight, but also made me additionally spent more money to book hotel for one night. Over the period of delaying, not service people informed us the reason, until very late end, all the passengers got angry, they just slowly gave us a bottle of water and chocolate. I contacted the service, they just said 'sorry, we cannot reimburse your cost for booking new flight and hotel'. The airline's error cost me spend far more money. But they did nothing to solve my issue. I complained with my friends, they all complained this company. This is the first time i took the flight from this company, no more.

### "Zero Customer service"
Zero Customer service via email or social media. I had a long layover at Gatwick, ten hours. They wouldn't check me through to second flight. I put luggage in storage so I could eat. I get a note of a flight delay while I am at the airport. Who reads beyond that subject line? I’m sitting near check-in gates not worried because of delay. No names called, no announcement I and five (5) other passengers assumed delayed flight delayed, but no check-in was the same. They closed the flight. Did not get to fly. I paid for extra baggage, premiere services. No one to contact for a refund or credit of any Part of it.

### "paid more 100€ for a check in"
Not Verified |  Bad experience, bought a tickets from the internet and paid more 100€ for a check in. Dont fly with wizzair. Very bad company, its only feels cheap and at the end you are paying more than normal flights

### "will never fly this airline again"
This airline is a joke. I have a disabled child and our passports haven’t scanned properly anywhere in Europe and because I didn’t check in online I was charged $150! Of course they close online check-in 3 hours before. I will never fly this airline again. Flyers beware.

### "total waste of time and money"
Not Verified |  Don’t waste your money even looking at this airline. They will charge you everything they possibly can (pay it or don't fly at the gate). I booked extra leg room, was charged 50€ for it, of course they changed my seat and now its impossible to get anyone to help me get a refund apart from AI silly chat assistant. Utmost frustrating and unhelpful, total waste of time and money! I paid for the flight over 324 € + 50€ extra charge for one cabin suitcase +50€ for extra leg room (not respected by the airline in the end) = total of 424€! Not so low cost after all...absolute disgrace! Customer service appallingly difficult to get to!

### "worth less than what you pay for"
To Wizz air, a ‘carry on’ is actually a personal item and a trolley bag is a ‘carry on’. The staff was rude at the gate and the flight was majorly delayed due to missing flight attendant. It’s a budget airline so some of this is expected but in this case it is worth less than what you pay for.

### "Absolutely terrible from start to finish"
Absolutely terrible from start to finish. Even if you add all the upgrades (which I did, extra baggage & I still got charged for going over despite not having any hand luggage). I paid for priority boarding and at check-in had to wait for other 'non-priority' boarding passengers. There was no priority boarding. When I asked what we were paying for, they said we could bring another bag (which you can just pay for when booking). Avoid this airline, rather pay a bit extra on another airline for a less stressful trip.

### "I wont travel with them anymore"
Fly on you own risk. I was on holiday in Catania and today morning woke up at 3:30 and got to the airport on 4 a clock for the flight. Sudden it was a fire on the airport of Catania, luckily nobody was hurt but every flight was cancelled and all the the flight companies where picking up their passenger to accommodate them on the hotels near by or re-route them to the closest airport so they can fly back home, only from Wizz air no one was present. We waited but we just got an sms that the flight was cancelled and you can get refund and that's it. No help from the company, nothing, 200 people left alone in a city with no where to go thanks to Wizz air. I wont travel with them anymore and I suggest no one does and hope they go broke.

### "Travel and Book on your own risk"
I had booked my ticket online through the Wizz Air website in the month of April to go from Dammam to Abu Dhabi and return as below flights: Dammam to Abu Dhabi for 23/6/2023, Abu Dhabi to Dammam for 30/6/2023. Experience for Dammam to Abu Dhabi for 23/6/2023 - Check-in was over the counter at the airport. Flight got delayed by almost 2 hrs and nobody knew what was the reason. No complimentary refreshment was given even after this huge time delay. I missed my connecting bus and reached my hotel very late at midnight due to this delay. Experience for Abu Dhabi to Dammam for 30/6/2023 - Now this is the real deal. When we reached the airport for check-in we were informed that we have online check-in option during booking. So they will charge to do check-in at the airport. That charge is almost 2 times of the cost of ticket. Wow! By the way, they will put every details like food choice, weight limits along with all useless info in ticket but they will never mention compulsory web check-in option in ticket and charges for not complying it. Also they are so caring to send you useless mail before departure to remind you to check about destination visa but never remind you to do web check-in which is only option as per their understanding and its penalty. This strategy was used to loot almost 10 more passengers who were there on the same flight. They were also cheated in the same manner and they seemed really upset which spoiled their vacation. In short, highly unreliable and really "cheap" tactics to take your money.

### "mishandling of our baggage"
Yesterday, we encountered a distressing situation with Wizz Air. My sister and I were traveling from Abu Dhabi to Antalya on an early Saturday morning. We each had one free carry-on bag, which we placed under our seats. After checking in, we proceeded to gate 17 for departure. However at the departure gate, we were informed that the flight's cabin baggage capacity was full, and they asked us to leave our carry-on bags there. They gave us tags and assured us we could collect our bags from the airport belt later. Since we only had our carry-on bags with us, my sister and I had packed everything essential, including clothes, undergarments, makeup, toiletries, footwear, and my tablet in those bags. Upon arriving at Antalya Airport, we were dismayed to find that our bags were not on the belt. We immediately filed a complaint, but the response from the complain center was that our bags were still in Abu Dhabi; they hadn't been loaded onto the plane. Now, my sister and I are left with only our small cross bags, containing just our passports and money. We have nothing else to wear or use. Our plan was to continue from Antalya to Trabzon, but without our bags, that seem to be impossible. What was supposed to be a mini-vacation has turned into a nightmarish experience all because of Wizz Air's mishandling of our baggage. We had so many plans, but now we feel lost and don't know what to do.

### "Plane was dirtiest I ever seen"
More than 1 hour delayed. Plane was dirtiest I ever seen. Seats, floor between seats are so dirty looking as cleaned last time 10 years ago never again don't fly with Wizz Air

### "It was the worst experience"
It was the worst experience of my life. We were boarded and held in the scorching hot corridor for hours, after which they used us out without a word of explanation . Flight never took off. they never provided 1 percent of regulations 261/2004, nothing at all. In any communications they only lied to me and said something else in every letter. Refused to pay compensation.

### "No longer a budget airline"
Not Verified | No longer a budget airline as the add on fees have been hiked significantly whilst Ryanair and easyJet have kept their add ons reasonably priced. Wizz's flights are also delayed more frequently than not. Wizz Air used to be reasonable but now seems desperate for money to the point of driving their company into the ground.

### "Disappointing experience"
Disappointing experience in general. All the flights from/to Vilnius were cancelled a few months in advance due to NATO summit, but wizz air pretended they never heard of this until the last minute and were even selling tickets on those dates. Their customer line is just useless - they neither have any info nor they can help. I got to pay additionally from at my own cost to reschedule my flights, as wizz air kept silent until the very last moment and I didn't want to lose my hotel reservations or stay without a hotel.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
I would rate this airline company 0 but there is not this option. I booked a return ticket for an emergency family issue, the flight cost me £350 return next day, when was my turn to give them the ticket for check to get in the plane the person on checking was holding me and another 4 people and told us that we have no more seats available, shocking as I have done my checking on time and I had allocated seat. I asked for the reason why this is happening and to give me a reason and the answer she started shouting and raising her voice as treated as the customer as nobody, awful experience. I have raised a complaint against but talking about Wizzair with no response. My advice is : better pay a bit more and fly with decent airline. By the way I am a member with them over the last 10 years but nothing counts with this airline. I am extremely disappointed and disgusted of how they treated people.

### "we cannot get a refund"
We purchased our tickets over 4 months in advance for four of us to fly from Budapest to Bologna. One month later Wizz Air cancelled. Try as we might, we cannot get a refund, despite assurances from the airline. Sadly, all they have done is lie to us. I would never recommend this airline. Over 10 months later we have had no success in recovering the US$400 spent. We flew Ryanair instead and they have never let us down.

### "Never again"
Never again. As simple as that. Worst web check-in environment, worst delays, worst attitude. What's the point of a timetable, if it's systematically late.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. In the last year, more than four flights of mine were delayed causing a lot of money loss. The staff are disrespectful and the organization is terrible. They are changing their prices continuously, which makes the booking very, very annoying.

### "Worst flight ever in my experience"
Worst flight ever in my experience, we were advised via email and phone that flight will be delayed. I have organised in advance for more luggage to be able to carry and paid extra. Arrived at Lisbon Airport to check in 2 hours in advance to be told that the check out was closed and there is nothing we can do , even though we understood that the plane was not even landed from previous flight. It was a nightmare, we had to protest to be checked in. That is within the standard two hours before departure. We asked what is the option, they said i had to take the luggage with me at the gate and pay extra for the luggage. Then they verified again our tickets and perhaps they saw that we paid additional fees for additional luggage and they finally checked us in. Then as we went at the gate we had to endure more than an hour for the luggage to be verified for size, and there was a huge line with people corralled like cattle with no option to sit or even use toilet as you would be afraid you'd lose your place in that que. We had to wait a lot to get through there were people with luggage that were made to paid extra. After an ordeal of waiting like cattle standing and being slowly marched through to check luggage size, we were further corralled towards the embarking gate, and after another about 40 min we were marched towards the plane by foot. We got in, we arrived in Bucharest shortly after 1.00a.m. and since then we are waiting at the band for the luggage to arrive. All the passengers are waiting whilst I am writing this review for luggage and it is 2.24a.m. with NO information as to what happened to luggage and when are they going to unload the luggage

### "experience was nothing short of a nightmare"
I recently had the misfortune of flying with Wizz Air, and I must say that my experience was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment I booked my ticket until the conclusion of my journey, the airline continuously tried to charge me in every possible way, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. Firstly, during the booking process, I was bombarded with various hidden fees. What appeared to be a reasonably priced ticket quickly turned into a financial burden. Wizz Air charged exorbitant fees for everything, including choosing a seat, bringing carry-on luggage, and even printing boarding passes at the airport. It felt like every step I took required an additional payment, making the overall cost of my flight much higher than anticipated.

### "Boarding was slow"
Flight delayed at departure but arrived on time. Boarding was slow. Cabin crew friendly and willing to help but stocked to the rule (no seat changes were permitted before take-off). Because it was the last flight of the day, some food and drinks products were unavailable (eg mineral water). A good flight home.

### "3 hours delay"
We took off with 2 hours delay for our destination which was Paris. On the way the pilot said that due to weather conditions (mid summer) we will land to another airport. At 10 pm we landed in Brussels. Even though the crew member said they will arrange for us transportation to Paris and they will compensate us, they never did. We manage to go to our destination at 10 am with our expenses. On the way back we had 3 hours delay plus 26 people had to stay back because they said one crew member was sick.

### "Excellent flight overall"
Boarding slow, waited on the stairs to board the bus. Flight was within the schedule, cabin crew friendly and willing to help. Seat comfortable, with lot of space (emergency exit). We travelled light, so exit in Basel was vey fast. Excellent flight overall.

### Wizz Air customer review
The system of WizzAir is not allowing to buy a ticket for somebody else - neither in the app, not on the website. You just cannot unclick the box “I am the passenger”, no way. When I tried getting help from the Live Chat Agent, I was told to buy a ticket and request name change, and it implied you just change the name and that is it. For each chat with the Agent, you have to provide your details, like the booking number and account email address, so that they know who exactly is requesting support. I did buy the ticket, and the same agent has informed me that in order to change the name on the booking I will have to pay the fee. Right after letting me know the agent left the chat. So, you have no chance to buy a ticket for someone else from your account, and the airline is telling you to do things, you will have to pay for. The airline is manipulating you into spending money for things that you wouldn’t normally have to pay for.

### "customer services are absolutely shocking"
Dreading, customer services are absolutely shocking, cannot speak English and refuse to acknowledge because I booked through booking.com, they slam phone down and very arrogant and rude, cannot view flights on app or online because I booked through agent, cannot print off boarding because of this. Horrible company.

### "have been consistently terrible"
Wizz air from start to finish have been consistently terrible, from numerously changing our flying times to trying to check in to charging us for seat then splitting us all up. Then unable to claim that money back. The whole process at the airport and on the plane was rushed and complete chaos, then to rub salt in the wound, we were asked to take our rubbish with us because they did not have time to clean the plane ( the state of the toilets verified this). Also just a warning if you book through an agent the wizz air totally wash their hands of you, so all I can say is travel with wizz air at your peril. They have lost 6 future customers here and by the comments of many on the plane they have lost even more. I have put NA for in-flight entertainment but the cabin staff certainly looked like a cabaret act.

### "Worst flight I have ever had"
Worst flight I have ever had. The cabin crew were absolutely awful. It was almost unbelievable how rude and unprofessional they were with their tone and manner to the passenger. They spent the entire 2hr 20 minute flight on their phones or behind a closed curtain eating food, to which at one point one of the pilots also joined.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service! My flight got cancelled yesterday for a technical fault from Paris orly to Rome Fiumicino, nobody was there to help. The tel number was not working and when i managed to speak to someone had no interest nor any information. In the end i bought a new ticket with another airline to get back home! While i understand it is a lowcost i would hope and still think that there might be some sort of help and not been left stranded.

### "advise to avoid such companies"
Not Verified |  Was happy that I found this direct flight Timisoara-Rome with WizzAir back in May. Unfortunately my happiness transformed to a distaste soon enough. Had to cancel my trip due to the fact my wife was diagnosed this week with a medical problem that needed immediate attention making us cancel our whole Euro trip due to various doctors visits. Anyway calling WizzAir told us the cancellation fee is 80% or the cost of the tickets, if I have to change dates is about 65% of the original ticket costs. They have no travel voucher to offer to be used later as I asked I need no money back. They offered to “negotiate” the cancellation cost of the ticket if we can provide doctor’s records resulting that my wife cannot travel, this is outrageous as medical records are confidential. Seems that letter from my family doctor was not good enough. Anyway I remained with very bad taste of the inhuman experience this company offered basically taking advantage of peoples unfortunate situation to make some money. Would advise to avoid such companies in the future.

### "nightmarish encounter with Wizz Air"
As a frequent traveler who has experienced countless flights with various airlines, I feel compelled to share my recent nightmarish encounter with Wizz Air. This scathing review serves as a warning to fellow travelers who value their time, money, and overall peace of mind. Brace yourself for a tale of incompetence, broken promises, and an utter lack of customer care. Let's begin with the initial offense: the cancellation of our flight without any plausible reason. We got an email the morning of our departure so we rushed to the airport to get some clarity only to be informed that your flight has been abruptly scrapped. Shockingly, Wizz Air failed to provide any legitimate explanation for this cancellation, leaving passengers bewildered and stranded without any clue as to what transpired behind the scenes. Additionally, they didn't have an option for both me and my partner to fly out until 3 days later which wouldn't work because of our work schedules. In a desperate bid for assistance, I reached out to Wizz Air's customer service while at the Palma airport. Little did I know that I was about to embark on an infuriating journey of unhelpful agents and contradictory statements. Despite assuring us that we would be reimbursed if we chose to book an alternative flight outside their company, this turned out to be nothing more than a hollow promise. They had no intention of honoring their commitment, leaving us in a state of financial uncertainty and deep disappointment. Refusing to give up, we sought professional help from an external company, hoping they could navigate the treacherous waters of Wizz Air's reimbursement process. Unfortunately, this only added insult to injury. Nine long and arduous months later, we are still fighting for the reimbursement we rightfully deserve. It is inconceivable that an airline, claiming to value its customers, could display such a blatant disregard for their responsibilities. Wizz Air's inability to provide a backup flight for three days highlights their lack of contingency planning and their disregard for the inconvenience caused to their passengers. Furthermore, their callousness in denying our rightful claim and subsequent inability to fulfill their obligations demonstrates a disturbing level of unprofessionalism and an alarming lack of transparency. Traveling should be an enjoyable and stress-free experience, yet Wizz Air has turned it into a nightmare. Their cancellation without reason, broken promises, and refusal to reimburse the amount we paid for an alternative flight have left us feeling betrayed and disillusioned. It is my sincere hope that this review will serve as a cautionary tale to potential passengers considering Wizz Air, urging them to explore alternative options and spare themselves the agony we endured. In conclusion, I strongly advise against choosing Wizz Air for your travel needs. Their lack of accountability, unreliable service, and poor customer care make them an airline that should be avoided at all costs. Spare yourself the headaches and frustrations that come with dealing with this unscrupulous company.

### "No customer service"
So, upon arriving 3 hours prior to my flight, it was already delayed by 2 hours. But it was then moved again another hour, then cancelled. We were told to go to the flight desk, with many other wizz air flights. But at the flight help desk, there was no-one there. No member of staff knew what was going on. We then got told to go to gate 12. So did other flights to different locations. Not blaming the staff, they had no idea what was going on just like us. No customer service, no information as to why it was all cancelled. As flights to Spain from Wizz still went ahead but Portugal and other Spain flights (from other customers) were cancelled? So what was it? I still don't know. I can't re-book without paying an extra minimum £100 for flight plus new trains into airport, tube etc, and the affordable flights dont even leave till evening next day so I lose a day on top of it.

### "how can I be on standby"
They sold more tickets then the airplane has seats, I payed 200 Eur for the tickets to come and I was not able to check in in the app or online, I came to airport where they give me the ticket without the seat number and write on it standby in meaning I might have the seat I have already paid, if I paid and reserve my seat, how can I be on standby. The airport service center was just saying how they don’t know and that I should contact wizz Air  which by the way is charging call 1e per minute and trust me they don’t answer until they take enough money for that call.

### "avoid this company"
I think it's misleading to call this a low-fare. It was nothing but. The first indication of a campy ticket was when booking the tickets for two families I added one large (20kg) suitcase to each family. to my surprise, the cost of adding the luggage was per leg and stood at a whopping $130 per leg, per suitcase. In total, I paid $270 for the suitcase. For comparison, the ticket was $162. Additionally, the advertised ticket price changed while I was in the middle of the booking process and jumped by $20 per passenger. So a projected $140 ticket (already pricey for a 37min. flight!) actually climbed to $252 (in a family of 3). This didn't include advanced check in cost, seat selection cost, and other money grabbing options. But the real shocker was upon return. We got to the ticket counter and expected to drop our luggage and get our boarding passes when we were informed unceremoniously that we needed to pay another 50 Euro per person to be checked in. This happened despite the fact that no such fees were asked for on the way from TLV to Larnaca. The ground team threatened to deny our boarding unless we paid. The confirmation email btw only mentioned that "If possible, always check in online before leaving for the airport. Otherwise, you might have to pay a fee at the airport. - no clear language there whatsoever. Nothing in red, no advanced warning via email or sms. only an automated response from the check in rep. The supervisor wasn't offering any help either. We had to run to the other side of the terminal, pay the fees, then run all the way to the gate (threatened with a closed gate) only to be left waiting for the bus to the plane another 20 minutes in a small hall with no AC. Finally, a 20min. delay while on the plane is almost always complementary. The final ticket price then jumped to a little over $300, a truly low-low-fare experience for the price of a full-fare flight. I'd say that unless you're traveling alone, with a small backpack, and have all the time in the world, avoid this company at all cost.

### "the flight itself was provided"
Efficient boarding, it was complete almost 20 minutes before departure time, then we waited in the airplane 45 minutes because of some airspace restrictions. Landing was about 5 minutes behind schedule. Cabin crew stick to the rules and no seat change was permitted. As usual, no free catering and nothing else but the flight itself was provided. The promise to take us from A to B was fulfilled.

### "boarding was efficient"
Flight departed and landed as scheduled, boarding was efficient. The aircraft operated from Sofia Wizz airbase. Cabin crew limited the communication to security matters only. Food and drink for sale as usual, no entertainment and no charging facilities. I would suggest the cabin crew: “smile more”.

### "the most clown show boarding"
Arrived with excess time, boarding was called and everyone rushed and got in line. A bunch of people had priority but there was no designated lane for priority nor was there anyone working aside from the gate to ask where to go. Some people waited in the spot that the sign said for priority but they were ignored. So they pushed past the line of everyone else and the gate agent helped them next. Which meant the rest of us with priority were left wondering if we should do the same? Chances are half of us had priority and it would feel fair to cut in line because of that. When I asked about where priority was supposed to have been as I was boarding, the lady just shrugged with an exasperated look. It was the most clown show boarding I’ve ever seen. Luckily there was still overhead space but I imagine many priority passengers had a hard time finding space. It shouldn’t be hard to make an announcement to explain what to do. Good news is the plane departed on time, shockingly but it was still an overpriced 1 hour direct flight at almost $150 with one carryon and a personal item.

### "A low-cost but efficient flight"
Security control at Dortmund airport was slow, but had enough time. No checked baggage, only small cabin baggage. Boarding started early, we had to wait on the staircase. Seat was allocated during online check-in, I had a standard window seat with limited but still enough space. Cabin crew polite and helpful. Departure and arrival were as scheduled. Food and drinks for sale, no inflight entertainment. A low-cost (€20) but efficient flight.

### "A pleasant experience"
We travelled light, with the smallest cabin baggage allowed (a rucksack). Boarding was efficient, via bus. I paid extra for extra legroom seat. Departure late due to weather condition, but still arrived on time. Cabin crew friendly and responsive. Did not buy food or drinks. A pleasant experience.

### "Denied boarding upon arrival"
Denied boarding upon arrival. Flight was delayed 3 times. We had to go from Tbilisi to Kutaisi for the flight. No information about the denial from Wizz Air, we were informed about it from airport staff showing us the list of denied passengers (40 people!). We had to take a taxi to Tbilisi to get on the next flight. Nothing ever received from Wizz Air side and they don't reply to emails and calls.

### "Do not use this airline"
Not Verified |  The flight was not comfortable at all. I have to pay 180 euro on the airport because I have not check in online. We were trying to do online check in a day before but it does not let me do it it say check in closed. The person on the airport say you have to pay or you have to miss your flight. It is all money making business. I have never experience this in any other airline Do not use this airline.

### "treated like an idiot"
Disgraceful handling of luggage damage claim by so called 'customer service'. The airline completely damaged my new suitcase on its first ever flight, I have followed their crazy procedures and supplied beyond repair documents from two different outlets (in addition to all the other documents), certified translations included and I am still treated like an idiot by what seems like bots (I choose to believe they are bots, if not, it is institutionalized group of Wizzair employees trained to steal your money, time and energy). It's been almost half a year now of this battle, with my emails being responded to on average after 3 weeks whereas when I sent one of my responses after 3 days, I was threatened with Wizzair closing the case. Shameful

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service. We weren’t even able to board the flight, due to them not checking us in. We were notified that our flight got delayed the night before, and we weren’t aware that the check in times were that rigid and remained the same although the flight got massively delayed. We arrived 20 minutes later than the original check in time and not only were we denied boarding, but the staff were extremely mean and unprofessional about it, including mocking us in a language we did not understand. We will make sure to avoid flying with this extremely unprofessional airline in the future.

### "firm to raise money with impunity"
Unacceptable, experience. I arrived at the airport with my Boarding on the phone, the employee told me that it was useless and I had to pay 45 euros. Abuse at that time you can not choose, rather than pay, That is the firm to raise money with impunity.

### "hate flying with Wizz Air"
As always, they show no respect on messing with our lives and our plans, on our money and our time. Shame on you for these "2 hours" delays. Just hate flying with Wizz Air! Same experience on my previous trip with you from the same location.

### "treated us without respect"
Not Verified |  
Humiliating treatment. It cannot be understood that people who work in front of the public treat people so badly. We did not know that we had to do the check in online. When making the reservation, select an option for which a higher amount was paid but the bags could be checked in. As in most companies, I took it for granted that when you checked in your suitcase, they gave you your boarding pass at the counter, which was bad on my part, we should have been informed and we assumed that the mistake is ours. We had to pay €45 each, €90 in total, but although this is a significant expense for us, the displeasure was the treatment received by the employees, they spoke to us and treated us without respect and laughing. I recommend people fly with any other company, respect and education are being lost. Trato humillante. No se puede entender que personas que trabajan de cara al público traten tan mal a la gente. No sabíamos que había que hacer el c/in on line. Al hacer la reserva seleccione una opción por la que se pagaba un importe mayor pero se podían facturar las maletas. Como en la mayoría de las compañías, di por hecho que al facturar la maleta te daban la tarjeta de embarque en el mostrador, mal por mi parte, deberíamos habernos informado y asumimos que el error es nuestro. Tuvimos que pagar 45€ cada uno, 90€ en total, pero aunque para nosotros esto supone un gasto importante, el disgusto fue el trato recibido por los empleados, nos hablaron y trataron sin respeto y entre risas. Recomiendo a la gente volar con cualquier otra compañia, se está perdiendo el respeto y la educación.

### "run away from this company"
Not Verified |  Awful, if you have options run away from this company. The only one reason to choose it is price, but I prefer to pay extra money to avoid this company. There can be late flights or even cancel your flight. No customer service. App is bad. Policy with 10 euro ticket and 20 euro seat is a joke, just sell tickets at 30 euro and let me choose my seat.

### "was a risk as rated worst airline"
Have travelled for over 22 years. Have experienced delays but not on epic scale like Wizz Air - outbound and return?! 1 hour delay outbound. I can live with that. We were informed No flight crew - they called in sick? Departure schedule 20:50. Late arrival back to London - kids at school and work. Message 1 - sorry for delay your new departure 1:30am. I had to read it several times to grasp that was a 4 hour delay. Then a few hours later Message 2 - new departure 2.15am. Now I was in shock. Arrive at airport midnight to see the board with estimates departure 2.55. What happened did all your pilots call in sick. I read the reviews and knew was a risk as rated worst airline in all reviews. You certainly deserve that rating. All of us sitting here with no one at check in

### "can't fault the airline"
Excellent flight. I really can't fault the airline especially considering how reasonable the fare was. The cabin is clean, cabin crew are courteous and professional. We took off on time and arrived a few minutes earlier than scheduled. The Captain stood outside the cockpit and said goodbye to disembarking passengers which is a nice gesture.

### "Really bad experience"
Really bad experience and will not use this company again. Outbound flight was delayed and no one had any information regarding the delay. Kept us waiting on the airport for couple of hours. Now return flight in the same situation delays 95 minutes with no explanation. Made us miss connection and had to wait extra and pay extra. Does not matter really if their staff if friendly if the planes are constantly delayed. Their customer service says that they are not responsible for any missed connections. Better pay a bit extra and travel well than with this joke company.

### "Worst experience with a low-cost company"
Not Verified |  Worst experience with a low-cost company. I paid for a 10kg bag when I bought my ticket but when boarding, I was made to pay 40 euros extra because supposedly the bag must be registered and must go in the hold even though it is cabin baggage. I have never seen such a thing, even the other low-cost companies do not have this policy. When I paid the 40 euros, there they did not find a problem with my luggage, this is clearly a scam. They try to extract money from customers by all means. On top of that, the flight was delayed for more than an hour and a half. Pire expérience avec une compagnie low-cost. J'ai payé un bagage de 10kg quand j'ai acheté mon billet mais au moment de l'embarquement, on m'a fait payé 40 euros supplémentaires car soit-disant le bagage doit être enregistré et doit passer en soute alors qu'il s'agit d'un bagage cabine. Je n'ai jamais vu de tel. Même les autres compagnies low-cost n'ont pas cette politique. Quand j'ai payé les 40 euros, là ils n'ont pas trouvé de problème avec mon bagage. Il s'agit là clairement d'une arnaque. Ils essaient de soutirer de l'argent aux clients par tous les moyens. En plus de ça, le vol a été retardé de plus d'une heure et demi..

### "Bring your own food and IFE"
Venice to Riyadh return. Both flights were on time. If you travel out of Europe you have to represent your travel documents at the check-in counter. The seats are comfortable, but not reclinable. Ground staff and cabin crew are friendly and proactive. Bring your own food and IFE as these options are limited.

### "a shambles of an airline"
Not Verified | Never ever fly Wizz Air it's a shambles of an airline and any money you save on tickets will be paid for by awful experience and awful customer service! First of all the check in was a disgrace. We waited in line for nearly 2 hrs and nearly missed our flight because of the check in delays. Furthermore, my bags were checked in under another passengers name (luckily as one of friends). This wasn't the end of it! Upon arriving in Lyon airport, it turns out that Wizz hadn't bothered to put at least 30 pieces of luggage onto the flight so left my luggage in Gatwick (along with around 20 other passengers' luggage). This meant I was on a ski trip with only the contents of my rucksack. The process of getting my bags back has been a disaster. Firstly they delivered my bags in Val d'isere to the wrong address, without informing me, so I flew back to London under the impression my bags were still with Wizz. Only because I had my phone number written on my luggage did I find out where it was (still in Val d'isere). It's now been 2 months since I flew with Wizz and still no sign of either of my bags. I wouldn't wish this situation on my worst enemy as this has been hell trying to get any information/progress on my luggage. Wizz charge £1.45/min on landline calls and £15 fee for calls that could be 'handled online'. For any money you save on flying with Wizz you will pay for it in admin and awful customer service. This is a god awful airline and I will never fly with them again. Please take this advice

### "no longer allows online check in"
Not Verified |  This airline no longer allows online check in, you must join a queue with only 2 staff while over zealous staff check size and weight of bags to try and charge you. After 45 minutes queuing we then had to run to security and the gate, which I would frankly pay a bit more to avoid - so use only if you really have to.

### "paying for mockery"
I think this company exists only because it is abusing EU regulations by the letter. They even did not have a plane in site at time of go to gate. Did not bothered to announce the delay or to make sure the airport displays the delay. NO ANNOUNCEMENT in the airport. The data should have come from this company. Because of the 2 hours delay without any responsibility, they decided it is cheaper to allocate the aircraft after check in is closed. I am pretty sure the hygiene on board is missing in action. And we had a fly proudly flying around with us all the way home. Useless delays, total disrespect of the passengers, constant overbooking/oversold tickets, no time for actually hygiene in the aircraft. An air pirate of the same type as Ryan Air. It is no wonder they are the sole remaining low costs around with multiple routes. It is not complicated to be profitable if you abuse your clients with regulations on your side. Everybody dreams of selling something they don't actually have. It is sad when this is a trip to your holiday. Isn't it? Why do regulations help them? How is it possible to not announce the flight delay until the passengers passed the gate? Because of regulations. So let's change them for better. Do not protect such companies. Flight schedule is not to be taken as optional or a joke. I do not enjoy paying for mockery.

### "Worst ever flight experience"
Flight from Frankfurt Hahn to Tirana. Two months out from the flight it got rescheduled from midday to 9:30pm. Inconvenient. On the day of the flight it was then delayed by one hour. The boarding was an utter farce. We'd paid for priority boarding but it was an uncontrolled rush for the seats. Do not bother with priority boarding. Worst ever flight experience

### "Very poor service"
Very poor service, the first time flying with Wizz Air our flight was 3 hours delayed and the crew didn't offer even water, and some passengers didn't have a seat even they checked in earlier online. During the flight it was very uncomfortable and very hot, no air-conditioning inside the plane. The second time, I checked in early online and bought a seat beside the window but when I got in the plane the crew said I can seat in any free seat. Because the last row of the seat ends in 32f and my seat is 32f, so the passengers who has a seat number from seat 33 and up does not have a seat. I bought a seat online to make sure I will be seating beside the window. And my seat was already taken by a lady, I just didn't want to make a scene because we waited for an hour on queue going inside the plane and I really wanted to seat and fly home.

### "my preferred airline"
Flight took off on time and arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. All Georgian cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. The flight was full but the cabin crew made sure the carry on bags were rearranged in the overhead bins so that the disembarking process is fast and smooth. I sat in the emergency exit and that is always comfortable. Wizz Air continues to be my preferred airline for travel in Europe.

### "attendants were borderline abusive"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed by hours and landed in a different County with no mention. Then there was no transport as promised. I was travelling with 2 young kids we were in a foreign county until 130 am with no help from Wizz air. The flight attendants were borderline abusive and Wizz air had no remorse and have no compensation. We had to figure out our own transport. They wouldn’t even help me find my buggy they lost so I was having such a hard time but they were no help.

### "advise against using Wizz Air"
I am extremely dissatisfied with the service provided by Wizz Air. I had booked a flight from Ankara to Abu Dhabi, which was cancelled by Wizz Air without any prior notice or explanation just 23 hours before the scheduled departure. I had planned my trip almost two months in advance and had also purchased non-refundable tickets for connecting flights. When I contacted Wizz Air to rebook my cancelled flight and sought assistance with my other airline tickets, I was informed that they would not take any responsibility for my other tickets. Furthermore, they could not provide any assurance regarding the possibility of my connecting flights being cancelled or not. As a result, I had to reschedule all my other tickets and incurred additional expenses for hotel accommodations due to the cancelled flight. I strongly advise against using Wizz Air and do not recommend their services at all.

### "plane was very dirty"
Plane arrived on time and quick debarkation and boarding, that had a disadvantage = plane was very dirty from the previous flight. Departed on time and crew was helpful to load luggage to the bins. Legroom was limited and seat was bearable, no recline. Food you have to buy from a menu.

### "Just horrendous"
Just horrendous. I've purchased my tickets 4 months before with no seat number preferences since I fly alone and payed for automatic flight check in. I had to go through all the hassle to go to check in at the airport to get a physical ticket since there was no ticket issued due to overselling of the places. Waiting to ses if any cancellation was a lot of stress for me . I truly hate so much.

### "just horrendous"
Everything about this airline is just horrendous - unfortunately it was the only one going to my destination so I had no choice! They will charge you for everything and anything - check in, seats, water - you name it. They don’t clean the plane between flights - the staff look a mess - uniforms dirty. I anticipated all of the above seeing as it is beyond budget (not that the price reflects that!). What I didn’t anticipate, was being sat next to a drunk person who they then proceeded to serve four alcoholic beverages to in one go. I attempted to move seats but was told it would cost me £20! I complained to Wizz but you can imagine the response.

### "cannot recommend Wizz Air"
I cannot recommend Wizz Air after they refusing me a refund for broken my bag. We booked a family flight and adding an expensive 26 kg Bag. We bought the American tourister bag in Australia. They broke the bag,  it wasn't not reparable but they don't give us any kind of refund. We are very sorry of this low quality service and customer service. With kids, travelling is not easy and we were in hurry with a Uber taxi at the airport and we found out only when we were out the Terminal that the bag was broken. The funny thing is that at the service desk in Venice they told us to ask for an online procedure of the PIR who helped in case of a partially refund procedure but they totally closed the claim with no possibility to replay, explain and adding information. it's weird that in person they told us that an operator would be kind and open to help but the fact this not happened.

### "single worst experience"
This is the single worst experience with an airline I have ever had. Everything about this was just insane. Promises of 'budget Friendly' were just the start. Me and my partner flew from Athens to Gatwick, £300 with cabin overhead baggage not included? (We are from Australia where this is standard for all airlines) If the tickets were actually budget I would understand. We arrived at Athens airport to find our flight delayed 2 hours. Ok, it's bad having your flight delayed but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since this happens to a lot of airlines. We looked up the aircraft info to find that there was no previous flight. As we waited at the airport we had 5 or 6 different times given to us by Wizz. Once the gate finally opened we made our way. We sat on the ground since seating was not available. Once we were ok to board we were put onto a bus to go to the plane. Once we arrived the driver opened the doors, told us "don't exit yet" and so we were left on the bus (packed in very tightly, there are no seats) for 15-20 minutes as we watched the cabin crew cleaning the plane through the windows. Why drive us out if the aircraft is not ready? And the plane has not had a previous flight AND was delayed 2 hours, the plane should have been prepared already? Once we finally got off the bus we were met by what I would find out to be some of the rudest hosts on a plane I have ever met. Every 5 seconds over the PA "please do not block the aisles to avoid further delays" to me seemed a bit rich after our experience so far. Also people are boarding, we aren't going to be seated in 3 seconds? When we sat, the aircraft was in a disgustingly awful state. Crumbs are everywhere, rubbish was left in the seat pockets. This aircraft was sitting here at the airport for a long time and the crew had done an abysmal job at preparing for passengers. The flight itself, once we got into the air was ok. Nothing special (they like to push their 'duty free' items on you for purchase, however I found that I could buy most of this stuff at Tesco for half the price). We landed at Gatwick and this is where the true torture began. Passengers stood to collect their luggage. As we were departing, the host grabbed the PA, stared directly into passengers eyes with the most disgusting look I have ever seen from flight crew "DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT" this was met with passengers fuming, how are we meant to get our luggage down then? He repeated it as I walked towards the front door of the aircraft "DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT" he proceeded to put down the microphone then step in front of me, put his finger to my face and said "WAIT" passengers piled behind me after this man had just told us not to block the aisles. He put his finger down "ok go". Me and my partner were livid. The consistent snarky rude comments from this crew was he worst customer service experience I had ever read not just from an airline but from any company I have ever dealt with. Please if there is one thing you take from this, DO NOT BOOK A FLIGHT WITH WIZZ AIR.

### "Wizz Air never again"
Not Verified |  The worst airline anybody can come across. Their website so difficult to navigate, the App invariably does not work or the boarding card is so faint and cannot be read at the airport, the staff rude and unhelpful. When you need to contact Customer Services they direct to a overseas number (I think Romania) and you are charged £1.95 per minute. The Staff English is poor and you can hardly understand them. In addition there is a delay in their flights with no explanation or even an apology. It appears to be a budget airline but when you add the extra charges for a 20kg bag (to and from your destination) it become more expensive than other airlines. Attempted to buy tickets for a trip to Cyprus on 14 May 2023 and including the fare, two bags pf 20kg and seats it came to £965 return. I finally booked through British Airways all inclusive for £565. Wizz Air never again. I advise people to keep away from Wizz Air if they can.

### "worst company I have traveled with"
Several hours before the flight we find that electronic check in is not available, as the online system does not complete the process. Arriving at the airport 2.5 hours before the scheduled departure, we are informed that the electronic check in is already closed and can only be done at a counter and after an additional payment of 45 eur / person. To our protest about the unfair and disgraceful charge and the complete lack of relevant information, the employee replied ironically that if we want to fly we have to pay the extra amount. To pay we had to wait at another counter with a huge queue and then back to the first counter to check in, where now only two employees (one of them extremely rude) served the 400 people who were anxiously waiting to catch their flight. While we were waiting, in the queue we realized that many of our fellow passengers had also fallen victim to the same fraud. To top off all the hassle and the charge of 90 Eur (2 people) was the additional delay of the flight for about an hour. Probably the worst company I have traveled with in the last 10 years.

### "Absolutely disgraceful attitude"
Never again, our flight Tallinn-Milan had been rescheduled 3 times and delayed for 20hr in total. All 3 times reschedule happened at the gate for boarding. Absolutely disgusting. Our return flight got cancelled all together again at the gate where we were ready for boarding. They treat their passengers like a cattle. If they would bother to cancel a couple hours in advance we at least could make another travel arrangement. Absolutely disgraceful attitude, and failing to provide the service they signed up to provide. No communication whatsoever, no refund/compensation either. Wizz Air failed to perform its duties and should held responsible. We ended up wasting 3 days in total and spend fortune for another flight (trying to organise it last minute).

### "Leg space was reasonable"
I was really sceptical about Wizz, but I followed the rules and online check in process and all went well, no extra fees. I already paid for my checked in baggage when I bought my tickets and stuck to the weight category I chose. The plane was clean, had basic features, safe and comfortable. Leg space was reasonable, I was able to sleep during the flight as well.

### "Cabin staff are good"
I cannot understand why this airline gets such negative reviews. I have used WizzAir on several occasions and the service has been good to excellent every time. Food on-board isn't that good, so take your own! Cabin staff are good, helpful and attentive on my flights Hungarian, British and Cypriot and no problems. The only thing I would say is the seats are rock hard so take a cheap thin cushion if this bothers you. At Euro 35, Larnaca to Luton on time, why complain.

### "Scam airline for budget travelers"
Scam airline for budget travelers - on the return flight they didn’t provide a way to check-in through email. Then they scammed us at the airport with a 45€ fee per passenger to be able to board a plane we had already paid for a ticket to board. We had to go to a different place with a long line to pay to get boarding passes. There were others also having to pay to get a boarding pass and on this line to pay for extra luggage. Then you have to go back to counter to get a paper boarding pass. It was a very expensive, convoluted and time wasting process. Not using Wizz again!

### "toilet should be cleaned better"
Flawless flight. There was a slight delay because runway was busy but we still made it only 25 minutes behind schedule. The toilet should be cleaned better during the flight.

### "The baggage allowance is a scam"
The baggage allowance is a scam. I have paid for it was not allowed to take my small standard cabin luggage in. The staff were too keen to take more money off me. This is the second time it’s happened.

### "real issue is the check-in method"
Absolutely basic service. However the staff seemed friendly and patient. My only real issue is the check-in method. You are charged extra if you don't check in online. This is fair enough as you are told in advance. However, even using the Wizz Air App, you are not given a boarding pass until you get to the airport where this is given at the desk on checking your passport. This is a right pain in the neck. It meant that, although I had no hold luggage, I had to stand in a very long queue waiting behind others checking in luggage, just ot receive my boarding pass. As a 67 year old man with some hip problems, this was very painful and very unnecessary as it would be simple to provide a 'no hold baggage' desk with a shorter waiting time. And wouldn't cost anything either. A pity because otherwise is competes quite well with other low cost airlines

### "Don’t book with this company"
On March 20, 2023 my flight from Rome to Paris was canceled due to a strike. I received the notification 1 day before the flight. The email said that one of my options was to claim a 100% refund or 120% credit. Since I don’t live in Europe I asked for a fully refund. I received the link to process my refund, but I was surprised that the system doesn’t allow you to get the refund until you first claim for a credit. After processing my credit, the system gives you another link to process your 100% refund, but when you get to the point to enter your credit card information, the system don’t allow you to go forward. No question could be answered. I’ve been trying to get in contact with someone from customer services, but no luck. You call the number they have for customer service, but no one answer. A lot of emails have been sent, but no response. The next day I received the notification of the cancellation, I went to Rome Airport (Fiumicino) but there is no one who represent the company. The employees at the counter are employees from the airport, but they can make any kind of decision. They tell you that you must contact the company. Don’t book with this company. If your flight got canceled no one will help you out.

### "No refund, no money, no trip"
I came to the airport 2 hours in advance, but I still lost my flight. The staff of SMK airport was rude and unhelpful and told me that according to Wizz Air rules they charge 60 euros for check-in in the airport. No refund, no money, no trip.

### "abandoned in Sofia"
Flight Sofia-Tel Aviv scheduled at 0555 on April 2 was first delayed till 1425, then after all passengers had been sitting on the plane for 2 hours, it was canceled under the most weird explanations given (first like "we missed out time slot and the tower does not allow us to start engines" and then like "BGU does not accept delayed flight"). Needless to say, no support or help given, no WIZZ representative on ground, no phone to call and no contact to, well, contact. 150 passengers are abandoned in Sofia, some rebooked with other companies, some just stuck in Sofia without any perspective and any resolution attempt from WIZZ staff.

### "Definitely not the worst low cost"
When I was preparing our trip to the UAE, I read a lot of reviews about wizz air. Unfortunately, there are no other low-cost airlines flying from Yerevan (at least, other flights are much more expensive). I hated Wizz Air in advance, and expected worse. I have installed wizz mobile app, and I couldn't check in - I was getting error "Something went wrong". But I successfully checked in on the wizz site. I checked in one person for free, got the free random place, and I checked second person (my wife), purchased next to my place for 11 euro. This way you can have places near not for twice price. We traveled with 1 year child. We got 3 cabin baggage places 40x30x20 up to 10kg each included, plus stroller for free. I have to say that was enough for us. We printed "boarding cards" (not boarding passes!) because airline can take money if you don't have them. The experience starting from the airport was fine. Good people, good service. Comfortable plane. Food is not included in the ticket. Definitely not the worst low cost.

### "very poor experience"
Not Verified | My partner and I were denied boarding due to Wizz Air selling too many tickets on a fully sold flight. They offered us a next flight available which was in five days and only two days before our return flight. We were then given a compensation claim form that assured us we would get the money that we would spend trying to get to Sarajevo. We booked flights to Belgrade, hotel for one night, flights to Sarajevo the next day as there was none on the same day. Soon after our return to London, we filled in the claims and expenses. No communication from Wizz Air side, no refund and it has been more than a month, horrible! You are happy to sell too many tickets but not happy to refund the money, very poor experience!

### "cabin and toilets were clean"
Priority lanes were respected but there was an hour delay to the flight. I was sitting in the emergency exit in seat 29F which was very comfortable but the cabin staff that was sitting opposite me was not very good - she charged me 7.50 Euros for a Starbucks capuccino and chocolate croissant when in fact this should cost 5.50 Euros as it qualifies as a special offer. Rest of the crew was very nice and the cabin and toilets were clean.

### "charged me 45 euro"
Worst airline ever. They charged me 45 euro cause the check in didn't made by my phone. They cannot service quality so they are trying to take your money by this appropriate way. I don't recommend it at all.

### "Delay 2 hours for departure"
Not Verified | No communications about the procedure to fly with Wizz Air from Saudi Arabia. No transit allowed. Full visa fees charged and no-one talked anything about at the moment of purchasing. Delay 2 hours for the departure. Absolutely no service at all. Bad experience, my advice is "pay little more and never do the mistake to purchase with Wizz Air

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever - check in system is the worst and they will ask you to pay a lot. They're taking your money for the worst service. Crew are rude and wouldn't explain it. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. Attached additional charges to pay because when you check in online you have to pay and when you check in with them at the airport even with 3hrs before you will have to pay 3x. My first time and definitely my last time with this kind of service.

### "the worst airline ever"
Easily the worst airline ever. Maybe it was some kind of joke to switch my seat so that a 2 meter tall guy would sit in the smallest seat on the plane? I didn't notice it when I got the ticket and they couldn't fix it afterwards. I wish I never had to fly with WizzAir again. Even 1/10 would be too high for such service.

### "Egregious, questionable business practices!"
Egregious, questionable business practices! I purposely called customer service ahead of time the day before, due to being unable to register for the flight and I did not want to be charged. So, the day of our flight we arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance. There were 2 people there to check in hundreds of passengers for two separate flights, and the line was not moving. When it was finally our turn (about 20 minutes before the scheduled flight time, the Wizz Air rep insisted we pay 80 euros for not registering ahead of time. I tried to explain of the IT issues I had encountered, but she wouldn't listen to us, and told us that was the "procedure". So we had to run to another terminal to pay - at which time there was 5 minutes left before the flight. When we asked how to get to the terminal, it was listed at the other terminal (3) (which was a good distance away) but the Wizz Air employee told us it was terminal 4. There were other customers from all over the world (Irish, Portuguese) who had the same problem. At this stage in the game I insisted they show us where we should go. But of course, we had to go through security - where they (temporarily) lost our passports! Honestly, I was afraid of having a heart attack. They did not seem at all concerned, as I assume this is the norm for the company. It was infuriating, and so unnecessary! I hope that no one else ever has such a problem. My conclusion - total rip-off, scam operation. We will never  take Wizz Air again!

### "Very unpleasant experience"
Very unpleasant experience when came back on Friday 24th  February at Varna airport. The Bulgarian employee of Wizz Air insisted on us showing her the Settled Status Letter in UK and kept us until all people left to the plane. This request does not appear in any of the travelling documents, in England the custom officers do not ask any of this. The Settles Status Letter is not for use and I cannot have it with me. The UK visa account provides all people with a settled status in the UK just with a share code. So, at the border in England, I show just the ID.

### "Always check in online"
Not Verified | Always check in online. Paid 80€ today as we had no internet to check in. 50€ fined to modify one letter in the name passenger. This company is a scam and total disgrace

### "Highly not recommended"
The flight was delayed and they put all people in the air hall without letting to move. Very difficult to get any help online. Phone call eats all money and you have to wait for ages. Instead of adding an extra luggage bag they just upgraded the luggage with the same bag. Instead of requested 2 bags I got 1 but with the higher weight. No return of funds, only on the air company account and you should use it with them only even if you don't even want to hear about this company. Or you will just loose the money. Seats are like village benches comfort. Definitely will never travel with this company again. Highly not recommended.

### "worst airline I have ever come across"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever come across. Bought tickets Riga - Eindhoven and back through their app (which i thought was the safest option). Flights got cancelled one by one, then struggle with refunds at first seemed like a relatively small problem, they just showed that my only option is to get my refund in Wizz Air credits, but for some reason it also showed that the refundable amount is 0 eur. I tried contacting live support which took about good 40 minutes, just to get an answer - you will get your refund to you bank account in 5-7 days. When 14 days had passed and I still haven't received my refund, i contacted them again. In result of spending 2 hours trying to get a solution, all I got was - sorry, nothing shows up. Well, I lost all the money, time and energy. Will not be buying from them ever again. Horrible company and scammers.

### "never fly with this airline"
A 4 hours delay on take off, without any justification. 3 passengers travelling with only one receiving an e-mail notification in English (a language he did not speak), while all the booking process was in Greek. We could not check-in luggage, as we were supposed to do so in the originally scheduled time, meaning we should go to the airport 4 hours earlier. What if the delay was 6 or more hours? No common sense on that. We remained 30 minutes on the airport apron and 1 more hour in the plane and they didn't have the sensitivity to offer some water for free. Will never fly with this airline even if it is the last airlines in the world.

### "Flying Wizz Air was a terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Flying Wizz Air was a terrible experience. They charge you $50 pound extra to check in, due to some nonsense corporate online policy. A three hr prior to flight online check-in is required, this rip-off policy Wizz created for their own monetary benefit. When you try to talk to them Wizz hides behind the policy they created and does absolutely nothing. Poor customer service, other people on our flight were upset by the Wizz check-in rip off and being charged extra for their carry on baggage. Heard other passengers comment they fly all the time and this is the only airline that charged them extra for carry on. Wizz doesn’t hesitate to suck every extra penny they can off of you. I would definitely recommend a different airline even if it cost more. By the time Wizz Air is finished pilfering your pocket it’s cheaper to fly elsewhere.

### "I was very pleasantly surprised"
My first time flying with Wizz and I didn’t expect much given the poor reviews, however I was very pleasantly surprised by my experience. My companion and I had been allocated sears apart which whilst a nuisance was no big issue. However, on boarding we got chatting to a wonderful member of cabin crew who was able to move us into seats together in an emergency exit row. Throughout the flight he, and the rest of the crew were excellent and undertook their job with smile and humour. Our return flight 2 days later, was also excellent. We were delighted to see that the same crew member was once again onboard and he immediately recognised us. He went above and beyond to make our flight comfortable and again move us to seats together. Throughout the flight we were well looked after by all the crew who once again were so friendly, making time to chat with us between duties. The flight deck crew did an excellent job as well keeping us informed of turbulence (we had some nasty turbulence on the way out) and ensuring we were well briefed on the route. Maybe we were lucky but our experiences have been the total opposite of many on here and based on these experiences I wouldn’t hesitate to fly Wizz again.

### "Be very careful using this airline"
Booked online. Paid extra for everything! Went to add checked bags which again you pay extra for. The site was a bit confusing, and I accidently booked two bags for my travel partner instead of one. Paid for all the extras and then noticed the extra bag for check in. Went back to the site for Manage Baggage but it would not allow a change for number of bags to check in. I contacted Wizz through their Live Chat. The agent said they don't credit back on baggage even though the charge was done just a few minutes before. Be very careful using this airline. Cheap up front then you pay extra for everything, and you have to pay just for the ability to upgrade! Even to call their "customer service" will cost you.

### "100 Euros for checking in at airport"
Over 1000 NOK (100 Euros) for checking in at airport. Online check in closes 3 hrs before, no info in my reservation about this. A small fee I could understand, this is just crazy, because they know we will pay anyway.

### "Very poor service in the boarding"
Very poor service in the boarding line at Warsaw airport. I was asked to fit my backpack in this metalic structure. My backpack has never had any problems in entering a plane and I was treated in a very condescending way. After losing 15’ and just taking out my computer, I was allowed to enter the plane without the extra charge (of course no need to say that 80% of other customers were having bigger luggage and they were not stopped or asked to size theirs). No sense at all, very annoying.

### "Never fly on that airline"
The airline canceled my flight from Porto to Milan. I had another flight scheduled from Milan Malpensa to Brindisi the next day, which I also missed due to their irresponsibility. I tried several times to ask for a refund of the amount paid, and until today, 7 months later, they still haven't paid. Never fly on that airline.

### "disappointed with the poor service"
I am very disappointed with the poor service of Wizz air, first they change the route of the flight and arrived at check-in it was already closed, the destination was to land in Naples in Italy but they make us land in Rome to after getting us on a bus that has to drive 4 hours more to Naples… it's incredible we book an air ticket to find us on the road by bus. This is the first and last time to use this company and I do not recommend it to anyone, besides it is better that we close this company. Je suis très déçu du service médiocre de cet appareil Wizz air, premièrement ils changent l’itinéraire du vol et arrivé au check-in c’était déjà fermé, la destination était pour atterrir à Naples en Italy mais eux nous font atterrir à Rome pour après nous faire monté dans un bus qui doit rouler 4h de plus jusqu’à Naples… c’est incroyable on réserve un billet aérien pour nous retrouver sur la route en bus. C’est la première et dernière fois d’utiliser cette compagnie et je ne recommande à personne puis d’ailleurs c’est mieux qu’on ferme cette entreprise

### "contact with support very bad"
Not Verified | We went to Rome and at the airport, they told us, that for cancelled flight we get refund (money compensation) The first contact with support was very bad and they wanted to convince us that the flight was not made due to force majeure. But we already knew from the airport that it was a technical fault on the plane. So, after insisting, they reimbursed one ticket. I have been demanding compensation for the second one for 3 months now. Zero communication. DON'T RECOMMEND

### "second rate so called airline"
Not Verified | No regard for customer service. Left me and my family high and dry with no support or compensation due to them cancelling flights. Tried on numerous occasions to contact them, eventually they came back spouting European legislation to avoid compensation. Even the CEO ignored our emails, Worst airline ever, think twice before booking with this unhelpful, disingenuous second rate so called airline! Absolutely disgusting!

### "unprofessional and rude staff"
Not Verified | Worst of the worst airline. Firstly we was delayed by several hours no info from airline or anything. When we got onboard we was greeted by unprofessional and rude staff members who clearly hated their job. We was sat in emergency exit rows. We got no briefing on how to use the doors like I have from other airlines. Staff members constantly talking to us with attitude and talking down to all passengers

### "I will never travel with them again"
Passengers who purchased the tickets together are being separated in different rows on purpose, even when the plane is half empty. The reason to do this is to make the passengers to pay extra for the seat selection. Wiz Air is the only airline which does that. Other companies are separating the passengers which are traveling together only if there is no other option. And even if you are separated from your buddy in the other airlines, they try to make you seat next to each other when you check in. Not the case with Wizz Air. The other thing - the toy drones are not allowed and nobody from the airline cannot tell you why exactly. Also completely stupid rule which the other airlines don't have. You can bring the battery to the plane (only possibly dangerous element of the drone), but you can not bring the drone, not even disassembled into parts! Wizz Air have some serious organisational, business and personal problems, I will never travel with them again!

### "First and most definitely the last time"
Not Verified |  First and most definitely the last time. Terrible service. They made me pay 35€ after paying 45€ for 10kg hand luggage. The lady was really rude, there were at least 15 people with the same problem and she kept saying: You will not fly with us. I will never fly with this airline again!

### "the worst airline I have ever travelled with"
By far the worst airline I have ever travelled with. Myself and my husband had our Greece to UAE flight cancelled 3 times across 5 days in August 2022. We had no choice but to fly with another airline to get back to get home. I started the slow process of uploading expenses and claiming compensation via their portal. I have received no compensation or expenses and it it’s now 7 months later. This is unheard of. The flight was starting in the EU so we are supposedly protected under EC regulation 261/2004. But even with this myself and my husband are outstanding any form of compensation  It’s completely unacceptable and I really hope Wizz are seriously looked into as they are not operating under the EU law. I have had extremely poor contact from Wizz Air and on social channels have been advised to contact call Centre. Call Centre continues to tell you they cannot support with complaints / customer services. It’s something I have never experienced before and I would avoid flying with Wizz at all costs. It makes me question multiple areas of their business if this area is so shockingly poor.

### "Wizz Air refuses to help me"
I bought a refundable ticket, my flight was rescheduled and I had to cancel tickets. The money didn't go to my bank card, but went to my Wizz Air account. Support of Wizz Air refuses to help me. Now I can't get my money back, I just lost them. Now contacting my bank and reporting a scam.

### "Do not use this company"
Not Verified |  My flight was cancelled and I requested a full refund in cash. Wizz Air promised the money would be refunded to my credit card but  they actually just gave me Wizz credits and 50 euro less than I originally paid. Be aware, Wizz Air trick you with the exchange rate when you buy your ticket, and then do it again with the refund. They promise cash but refund with credits. I was charged 50 Euro for a flight that Wizz Air cancelled! Do not use this company.

### "a complete disappointment"
I filed the claim for compensation of the broken luggage, they responded with a request of some additional papers. I have provided the full list of everything they asked, and after this they just simply stopped responding. 5 email and no response, just ignoring my messages. Now I opened a dispute with my bank against them. It's a complete disappointment and 0 stars to this cheap (in terms of quality and service) airline.

### "I will not be able to travel at all"
The experience with this Wizz Flex option is like walking on the street in broad daylight, someone sneaks up on your from behind, extracts 200 Eur from your pocket and walks away. Now the long story: I specifically bought a return flight with Wizz Flex option, in total amount of 260 Eur (212 Eur the actual flight fare and the rest in fees). So I would expect (after reading the Terms & Conditions of Wizz Flex), in the eventuality of asking for refund, to be entitled to 212 Eur back. I postponed the flight once. During this process, the Wizz Air website shows you available dates and after you select the new dates, it computes the price for the new flight and shows you only if there is a difference in price in their favour (if you have to pay something extra or not). I did this, nothing extra to pay, all good here. Later it became clear I will not be able to travel at all, so I went for the second benefit of the Wizz Flex, cancelling and getting a full refund. Surprise: Wizz Air congratulates me for being eligible for a full refund: 40 Eur! At this point I spend more money to call them (the only way to contact is by phone, charge with 1.2 Eur per min), to find out that when I postponed the flight, my refund value was automatically changed to the value of the flight from those new dates. A value which was not even displayed to me during this process. Again, during flight change, Wizz Air computes the value of the new flight and only shows you if you have to pay more for the new dates. It purposely does not warn you that not only you don't have to pay more, but that you are exchanging tickets worth 260 Eur to tickets worth 40 Eur and that this will affect your refund value too. Besides this practice being so obviously mean to trick you, is this even legal? To make a parallel, it is not legal to run an online shop that shows products you can buy, to charge your customers and to not show them the price they will be charged with. Even if you add this to your Terms & Conditions, that the client must do whatever they can to figure out the price and that you're free to charge whatever you like, it is not legal to do so.

### "still have not received our refund"
Me and my wife were looking forward to flying with Wizz, with the new aircraft they where using. That's where everything changed. On the day of our flight we got a text at 09:32 to say we are sorry to inform you W9 5721 LGW-PMI flight is cancelled. To re-book or refund please visit wizzair.com. Your rights were emailed to you. Great we had about 2hours to sort this either rescheduling or finding another flight as our airport is about 2hours away. We ended up using Ryanair from Stansted which is 2 1/2 hours away. They got us there almost on time, on way home we were delayed over 4 hrs but Ryanair gave us compensation and it was handled very quickly can't complain so for that thanks Ryanair will use you again in the future. So we submitted our claim with Wizz on the 4-10-2022 we got a response on the 29-10-2022 to say they are looking into the claim. On the 29-11 they said that our claim has gone through and we will receive our monies 14 - 20 work days as we opted to have the money instead of the Wizz credits. We still have not received our refund well over the 20 workdays have emailed them still waiting to here back 8 days have passed. Avoid using Wizz as they seem to struggle to offer just a simple flight and you can't seem to get anywhere if there is a problem like a simple claim to give your money back. Never will I ever consider using Wizz again!

### "first and most definitely the last time"
This was the first and most definitely the last time I have used these scammers services. As per usual (judging by the number of negative reviews on the same matter) I was unable to check in to my flight due to a technical issue with THEIR system. Nevertheless, and despite my complaints, I had to cough up €100 so they could check me and my partner in the flight. To add insult to injury after paying the check in “penalty” to a separate booth (as per their usual tactic) and returning back to the check in area the lady had the audacity to inform me that I had not checked in. After providing the receipt that the other employee gave me to supposedly check me in the lady in the check-in counter proceeded to print our boarding passes within seconds. €100 for printing two boarding passes. Avoid these scammers at all cost. Everything from the predatory nature of their website where they charge you for things that other low-cost airlines never did, to the customer service, to the “glitches” in their system indicate one thing. Their sole purpose is to take your money.

### " a very unethical company"
Appalling customer service, or non-existent customer service should I say!! My friend and I have had problem after problem since we booked flights with them back in Sep 2022. They cancelled our outbound flight to Reykjavik without explanation, and there was no alternative with Wizz Air for the same day we wanted so we cancelled that flight with them and ended up paying more for another airline to fly on same date! They still haven't acknowledged or responded to our requests, let alone refunded the flight fare yet! It’s been 3 months. On a separate return flight with Wizz Air (that shockingly wasn’t cancelled), online check-in did not work - with a message of internal error appearing on the online portal. 3 times I tried to check in online with the same issue recurring, so I had no choice but to leave it there. At the airport, the desk staff made us pay airport check-in fees of 45Euros per person, which is outrageous in itself, despite us explaining the online error we faced, and then said you can contact Wizz Air customer service later to claim this back/ask them to waive fee. Absolutely ridiculous. There is not a Wizz Air representative present at the airport, as all their desk staff is outsourced so trying to have any matters sorted on the day is futile as these staff members have no authority to make decisions. To make matters worse, one of the in-flight crew members were also extremely rude. I was travelling with a friend who became injured during our trip and needed accessibility assistance; the crew member failed to communicate how she would be supported upon landing to get off the aircraft, and became very rude and impatient in her responses, when we asked legitimate questions after landing. We waited until all passengers had left the aircraft, and only then approached them to find out what was going on but we were just sharply told to “Wait!” without any clarification about what help will be offered. It is disgusting that they would treat a vulnerable customer with so much disrespect, and do so little to reassure them. We have been contacting them for months since our initial booking, but have not had any response or any positive action taken to resolve matters via email and through their contact form online. It is almost impossible to get hold of them. They simply don't care, and just want people's money. It seems it is not only their customers they treat so poorly since I spoke to a crew member on the flight, who also moaned that they have received many complaints and even as a staff member, she wasn’t even offered a flight with them to visit her family members who were unwell or easily given time off. It’s clear they are stone cold as a company, and care about nothing but profits. There are so many negative and worrying articles about them in the media. Still, they don’t act on customer complaints in a timely manner. I rarely waste my time and energy on writing bad reviews, but Wizz Air have been so poor with their customer service and strike me as a very unethical company given the countless bad reviews and comments I see online everywhere, that I feel compelled to write my experience also. I would not even give them a single Star but unfortunately you have to click on one to post a review!! I am fuming and will never be using this airline again. We also intend to escalate our case to the Ombudsman from here. Please do not fly Wizz Air, if there’s a reasonable alternative available to you! I would much rather pay a lit

### "Gate changed without notification"
Not Verified | The first and last time I fly with this company. 2 hour 30 mins of delay (annoying but this can happen). No communication from staff. Gate changed without notification. (only after asking) we were offered a voucher which could only be used in a shop a huge walk away from our gate, the voucher was valid for one pathetic bottle of water (no food). Flying with children who were starving. Lesson learnt. Pay a bit more for a ticket with a proper company.

### "wonderful flight attendants"
It was an amazing experience, with wonderful flight attendants Edina and Oskana. Thank you for everything. Leather seats, organized crew, no problem with luggage Check in.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever! This is the only airline I have encountered that is actively trying to bring discomfort to its passengers. Not even Ryanair is so greedy that they not only on purpose don't put companions next to each other with "random" seat assignment but it is so not random that they block the seats around you (even though they are free) so that you can only sit next to each other if you buy seats for both (changing one is never enough). In addition, they are actively searching for people who's bag might be slightly to large and force them to by "priority luggage" on the spot. Be aware that this airline does not just strictly follow its own rules but actively tries to bring you discomfort in the hope they can squeeze you for some more money

### "a pleasant experience"
Excellent service. Smooth check-in, no line, fast track at the airport for an extra 5 euro. Flight on time. Friendly staff, paid on-board catering. Overall a pleasant experience with this airline.

### "Absolutely rude and terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  By far the worst airline. 1st of all they make people pay to check in at the counter. Ridiculous! Who does that? If you check in online in advance than you don’t need to pay 50 euros per person. We had 8 people traveling and when I tried to check us all in online I couldn’t because the website had a glitch in the system that was rejecting one person to check in. I tried everything, by excluding that person from check in but the site didn’t allow it. So, when I went to the airport counter and explained the situation they completely ignored the fact that their system is not set up correctly and made me pay additional 400 euros (50 euros per person) for check in. Absolutely rude and terrible customer service. Very bad experience. Do yourself a favor. Travel with class with more established airlines.

### "Avoid at all cost"
Would give zero if could. International flight cancelled 30 minutes before take-off. Left stranded at airport 11:30 at night. Complaint and escalation via ombudsman. Found guilty and instructed to pay compensation. It has been 6 months and still no compensation paid. Avoid at all cost. It might be cheap on the surface but it will cost you so much more in the end.

### "I'll not use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Firstly, they charged every passenger AED 180 for the check-in, none of the airlines charged me for check-in. Secondly, we took more than 1 hour to do the boarding, which delayed our flight I'll not use this airline again.

### "Avoid Wizz air at all costs"
Wizz Air cancelled our flights 3 hours before our flight - no reason provided - left us stranded in London without any support, guidance, vouchers. Nothing except the ability to rebook on the next available flight 2 days later (from a different London airport). We covered all costs ourselves - hotel, taxis etc. We are now more than six months later and Wizz Air have not responded to any of my multiple emails or claims - NO reimbursement provided and no compensation which is in fact legally owed under EU law. Avoid Wizz air at all costs. Also, how are the appropriate bodies still allowing them to operate as an airline? Bizarre - they are absolutely shocking.

### "I will never use this company again"
My flight delayed 5hrs, I spent 8 hours at the airport. When I finished the complaint about delayed flight was written, that We usually solve this type of complaint within 10 days. Our team is actively working on resolving your claim in the shortest time possible. Doesn't matter, that 8 weeks is the maximum period to be resolved this kind complaint, passed almost 5 months no reaction from them. To contact them about existing complaint is impossible. I will never use this company again.

### "I can only agree with the many other bad reviews here"
Not Verified |  I can only agree with the many other bad reviews here. I cant even prove my review, because at no time did we receive any receipt. Not even for buying the ticket, not for cancelling the tickets, not for calling and asking for a receipt, not for writing to them to complain. Why is this? We had two return tickets bought directly through Wizz Air. They moved the return home time forward 12 hours, which is why we contacted them to cancel the tickets. They stated that they could and I asked thoroughly if we got all the money back, which was confirmed several times. Time passed and we heard nothing, we call again for a refund. They stated again that the money was on its way. On the 3rd call, which was 3 days before departure, they suddenly told us, that we could not get the money back! They had since the first call cancelled and deleted our tickets from our Wizz Air page, so now we were without money and tickets. The complaint has been sent, but now over one month later we haven't heard anything. Unfortunately, we only read the many reviews afterwards. There are probably many people who travel with Wizz Air every day without problems, but on the day you have to changed something or refunding, and then I would probably be nervous.

### "Absolutely appalling!"
Not Verified |  Absolutely appalling! They cancelled my flights 6 months in advance and only offered a partial refund despite not having any alternative flights available! Awful company!

### "I’d recommend avoiding them"
Flight canceled and got no refund. The flight was delayed for 3 hours and then totally canceled last minute while we were boarded in the plane, leaving no one with any provision for accommodation. Awful customer service and compensation (I got £0) even though they said they would refund me for travel and accommodation. This was clearly a lie as it’s been over 2 months since. Won’t be flying again, I’d recommend avoiding them.

### "excellent value for money"
I fly Wizz Air regularly and flights are pleasant, excellent value for money and usually take off and arrive on time. On my flight from Rome to Timisoara the flight crew was mostly Italian (and perhaps Maltese) which probably explains why they came up with the nonsense idea to tell passengers that "for the balance of the plane please do not stand in the aisle whilst waiting to disembark" which is of course false but it was a harmless idiocy nothing else.

### "Awful customer service and compensation"
Flight was delayed for 3 hours and then totally cancelled last minute after waiting for hours at the airport, leaving no one with any provision for accommodation overnight at 9pm at night or alternative flights home. Awful customer service and compensation (I got £0) even though they said they would refund me for travel and accommodation for the inconvenience. This was clearly a lie as it’s been over 2 months since. Won’t be flying again, I’d recommend to avoid them.

### "The worst rip-off an airline has ever performed on me"
The worst rip-off an airline has ever performed on me. They do go out of their ways to make you feel the pain of deciding to fly with them: they show you technical errors while you try many times to check-in online for your flight - so you cannot do it and then at the airport they charge you 40+ EUR per person for on-site check-in (4 people = 170 EUR!). They first ask for a screenshot of the technical mistake, you show it to them and then they say: "You should have called our Call centre - it\s your fault. So by their logic I should have paid 3 EUR a minute for a call in a foreign country for the sake of their technical "error" ( it is a usual "error" their system seem to be trained to create for several customers on that flight and each of their flights as we figured out at the airport talking to fellow-passengers who were ripped off the same way on the spot). I don't even mention that I paid extra for the seats but at check in they put my 5 y.o. daughter at the front of the cabin and us - at the very back! Please never use this airline - I hope it would go broke soon for such horrible business practices.

### "€55 each to check in"
Probably the worst airline I have ever used. Go out of their way to rip customers off. Would prefer to pay more with another company than have them charge my family of 3, €55 each to check in when the online check in isn't working. Then, suggest that because we didn't call the £1.49 a minute help desk it was our fault (do you see anywhere in the check in screenshot where it says call the help desk? ).

### "terrible flight attendants"
Not Verified |  I tried this company for the first time ever and for sure I’ll never repeat it! Please be aware that you are paying for a low cost company that if not checked in exactly 24h prior the flight they will charge you with 40 pounds more at the counter, people are rude as hell, I barely understood when she told me to size my bag and she raised the voice annoyed, and only accept card payments. Was the biggest mistake as through website while proceeding with the purchase they increased the flight automatically in 10 pounds extra (during the process of inserting card details, I should have suspected). No space for legs, no options on food, terrible flight attendants, that seemed they hate their jobs and are obligated to be there.

### "seats were quite comfortable"
I flew from Luton to Sarajevo on 29th October. The check-in process was quite efficient, The boarding process not so much. I don't know if this is a Luton management or Wizz Air management issue. However, cramming 200 passengers before the aircraft has even arrived in a small room with no ventilation was neither healthy nor with small children, significantly difficult. Flight took off on time. The seats were quite comfortable, and we landed in Sarajevo on time. On the return flight on 4th November, the service was quite better. A newer NEO aircraft, Smoother boarding process and a smooth flight - I'd advise that Wizz Air expands to other UK destinations like Bristol Airport to make it easier for South West & South Wales pax to connect with EU destinations without the extra journey.

### "Awful experience"
Awful experience. I do not recommend it. Wizz Priority costs more but it is just a scam. Our original flight was changed afterwards so we lost nearly 2 Days. Our Original Seats (we paid extra) were also changed. Worst Company ever. We will never fly again with them.

### "Never again"
Not Verified |  Never again. Booked upfront a flight with 4 nights in Venice, Wednesday (evening) to Sunday (morning). Reasonably cheap, alright. A couple of weeks before the outbound flight was postponed by 20 hours, meaning the trip became one day shorter. (BTW, they do not even bother to update you, it was the travel company which sent a note). But even this is not their ugliest record: on Friday get a message that the return flight is moved at 7am on *Saturday* instead of Sunday - 23 hours earlier than planned! (And again - no message from WIZZ, just from the travel agent). Say what? Making the itinerary two days shorter! Moving flight a day earlier a few hours before the new flight time with no rebook, refund, cancelation options! I could not even imagine this is legal. (As a result I had to book another return flight) All this comes on top of constant flight delays and cancelations. WIZZ, you lost my business in favor of more honest companies.

### "Terrible airline and staff"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline and staff, kept us on the plane for 5 hours, after 3 hours of delays, and then finally cancelled the flight stating that staff cannot legally put in any more hours. Stewards charged people for meals and drinks even after 3 hours which is against their policy. Stewards promised that their own Wizz Air staff were at the airport and accomodation and rebooking would take place. Of course no Wizz Air staff, just a few beleaguered ground crew (employed by a totally different company) some of whom were rude. Also two burly armed policemen were standing guard in the area we herded into. No help, no guidance. No accomodation provided as everything was booked, no shuttles, no flights booked as they were all sold out. Wizz Air refuses to compensate. Disgusting and don't bother paying extra for priority, it's rubbish.

### "charge you for not checking in online"
This airline is a scam. They will charge you for not checking in online when there is no email/option provided. It's not our first time to travel so we know that we can check in online before our flight but like I said there's no option provided. But the the lady keep saying it's impossible and then we observed that they have the same script to each and every passengers meaning they know its happening. So before booking in flight check the review first especially if it's a budget airline because you'll never know your spending more than booking a decent flight from a decent airline. Their booking partners must take action with this ongoing issues from this airline too.

### "I don’t recommend this company at all"
Not Verified |  After a delay of almost an hour, they crowded all the passengers in 3 buses and then they made us wait in front of the aircraft for about 20 minutes. People were getting sick because of the kerosene smell. After all this wait they announced that the flight was cancelled, I don’t recommend this company at all.

### "never fly this rubbish airline again"
Not Verified |  Our flight was scheduled at 11.05. Now for the third time it is delayed to 15.02. We are travelling over for a funeral tomorrow and were to be picked up at Gatwick by friends travelling from Brussels. Not going to happen now. This is the 3rd time in 3 days this flight has been seriously delayed out of Faro. Totally unacceptable and nobody to talk to. Will never fly this rubbish airline again.

### "stuck on plane, no information"
Not Verified | Terrible experience, avoid this airline whenever possible if you don’t want to ruin your holiday. Delays, unforeseen shaky landing, stuck on plane, no information - all the worst flying experiences you can find it here. Had a flight that was supposed to arrive at 9:20pm, still stuck on the plane after 1.5hrs. It's a Sunday evening flight people need to work tomorrow. Will never take this airline ever again.

### "Wouldn’t recommend this airline"
They have untrained and inadequate staff, extremely rude. They occupy the front cabinets with their luggage which means that the passengers flying on rows 1 and 2 need to store their stuff beyond row 3. Their flights are delayed and they never compensate. The irony lies on the fact that they are asking for a review after each flight to certify how awful they are and once you are confirming their level of unprofessionalism they are asking to compare our experience with Ryanair. Ryanair is far more professional than this inadequate airline. Wouldn’t recommend this airline not even to an enemy.

### "cancelled flight in June with absolutely zero customer support"
Not Verified |  You are better off paying more for another provider or even walking to your destination than flying with this shambolic organisation. I would give 0 or even minus if I could. They cancelled flight in June with absolutely zero customer support at the time meaning we had to abort our holiday to Sicily and drive back from Gatwick to Bath as no Hotel was offered and no alternative flights we available. No one at the airport to talk to. Fast forward to October and we still haven’t received our £600 compensation which we needed to cover the cost of our hotel and travel costs to and drop the airport. Despite countless emails that are never replied to. We did receive an email saying it would be paid in 14-20 working days. This date came and went as we expected it too. They make it as difficult as possible to receive your money and are virtually uncontactable. The live chat doesn't work, several times I have joined and received a message saying 'agent has left chat' before it has even begun. I have spent hours trying to connect to someone with no luck. They are happy to charge £1.50 a minute to call their helpline which I refuse to do, as I will never spend another penny with this pathetic excuse for a company. It has been exhausting and has tainted my view on flying aboard, purely because of the level of hassle this has created.

### "don't use Wizz Air"
Not Verified | I'm a frequent flyer (twice a week between UK and EU) and this airline is the worst I've used. They used to be good but not anymore. Almost always late and if you want to get any refunds or reimbursement retrospectively you cant forget - it will take ages. Just a friendly warning - don't use Wizz Air.

### "want to receive the reimbursement"
Not Verified |  I spent the whole day to go in this trip. Drove more than 150km from Torino to the airport in Milan, I had to leave the car in a parking that cost 15 euro a day, then on the way to the airport I got a message saying that the flight it was postponed from 19:25 to 20:45 and then after a long wait at the airport I got another message informing that the flight it was cancelled. So basically I had to drive all the way home again and could not find another flight and lost a important course that I was going to do. I want to receive the reimbursement.

### "Wizz has been an awful experience"
Booking was fairly easy and seemed a reasonable price. We only took hand luggage which worked well. Outbound flight to Podgorica went ok with a small delay and staff seemed fairly friendly. However, on our return flight we got delayed 5 times at the airport before being completely cancelled with no reason given. I had no mobile service and the airport had no wifi available for public use. I therefore asked airport staff for help who said they were unable to help and to contact Wizz directly. I eventually managed to get Wizz on the phone who offered me a refund for my cancelled flight but no further assistance. I therefore had to go around asking people to hotspot their mobile data so I could organise alternate flights, hotels etc. Because Podgorica is a small airport we had to travel to Dubrovnik, Croatia to get home. I have since sent a claim to Wizz, the claim was sent over 30 days ago and their website clearly states "normally dealt within 7 days, certainly within 30 days" - well that obviously is not true. I have tried contacting Wizz in other ways but they literally make it impossible with every member of staff saying they are unable to assist and unsure what to do. Overall Wizz has been an awful experience and for the sake of saving £50 each on air fares we're currently over £1000 worse off due to rebooking flights, accommodation, taxis etc. I really would recommend choosing a more reputable airline that at least helps out when flights inevitably get cancelled.

### "return flight was a nightmare"
Cant complain about the outgoing trip, cheap, about what you'd expect, the return flight was a nightmare, The flight got cancelled 3 hours before boarding, we were informed at check-in, didn't get a notification for the airline about the cancellation. Compensation: still ongoing, they gave us credit for their airline, which we explicitly said not to, and got denied accomodation and rebooked flight refund. Their site and claims management is really bad, their site logs you out whenever you go to the claim forum, they dont support password resets (even tho they say they do, my father got locked out of his account and is unable to get in no matter how much he tried to reset the password), unnecessarily convoluted.

### "not refunded me yet"
If you want to take a risk for the low cost airline go ahead but beware they will cancel at the last moment and you will have to pay double or triple the amount for the next ticket. This happened for me and the best part is that its been 30 days and they have not refunded me yet.

### "doing everything in their power to ensure you can't check-in online"
Not Verified |  They are doing everything in their power to ensure you can't check-in online (deliberate bugs, no mobile compatibility, error messages etc.) so they can charge you in the airport 90 euro. This is my 3rd flight with them on the span of 2 years and the process is just becoming more harder and impossible online so they can steal money from you. Seat selection not available" while trying to check in and then they ask you to use live-chat which never works because all reps are busy all the time (for 2 years), they force you to call their call centre which is a premium phone number! (2$ a minute!) and charge you 15 euro per each change or transaction (even check in over the phone when the online doesn't work).

### "worst experience ever"
No service - worst experience ever. I cancelled my flight 3 months prior to departure. Still I am fighting to get my money back. They play "back-and-forth" when it comes to requesting a compensation. Unclear communication, unfriendly customer service people, ambiguous and contradictory statements regrading your compensation status, no mail records regarding your conversations with customer service.. The worst ever customer experience I encountered with an airline.

### "still no compensation from Wizz Air"
We booked a flight home months before, we knew it was an uncomfortable flight, meaning we should take off at 21:45 and land at 01:55. But, at 7pm i get a text from wizz that we have a 1h delay. After a few minutes another text that said the new take off hour is 1:10, the next day. After i get an email with a 4€ voucher for my trouble, and that’s it. At 23:00pm some flight attendants tell us with an attitude that our plane will land in about 1-2h and we will board. At 00:45 starts the boarding, with the same arrogant and angry attitude from the crew. I have paid extra for my seat and to have my suitcase with me, on the plane i had no place for my luggage and they were very upset when i pointed out i paid good money for that privilege. We take off qnt 1;30 and i get out of the airport at 5:30, and we had work the next day. They were unpolite and not helpful the whole time, considering everyone was exhausted from that long wait. And still no compensation from Wizz Air.

### "Denied boarding with two young children"
Not Verified | Denied boarding with two young children, requesting a supporting letter with the passport, although not explaining what exactly they want, simply walking away, suggesting they are short of staff. I have missed my flight, returned home, yet still don't know what letter was I requested, nor knows the Embassy of the country I was traveling to. Simply unacceptable.

### "This is air travel at its most chaotic"
Expect delays - expect no information - expect the first delay to be extended by a second delay or more, don’t book priority boarding because there isn’t any and it’s a free for all. This is air travel at its most chaotic.

### "no notification of delay"
I had a flight to Rome at 9.40 am and not only did we leave on time but there was no notification of delay. By 10 am I had already understood (by myself that my flight was delayed) and I had to wait for 10.15 to receive an email informing me of the next departure at 12.00. It is currently 12.08 and I have not yet left but I have not received a second email more or less 10 minutes ago that warned me of a subsequent delay of another 2 hours. At the very least, the company should have provided vouchers to buy lunch and so it was. The vouchers cover a cost of € 4 and in skiathos airport you hardly even buy a coffee for that amount. At the end, I'm still here waiting to leave with a very expensive lunch that I had to buy with my own money, hoping not to receive another email 5 minutes before my flight warning me of another delay! Avevo un volo per Roma alle ore 9.40 e non solo siamo partiti in orario ma non vi è stata alcuna comunicazione di ritardo. Alle ore 10 avevo ormai capito (da sola che il mio volo fosse in ritardo) e ho dovuto attendere le 10.15 per ricevere una mail che mi avvertisse della successiva partenza alle ore 12.00. Attualmente sono le ore 12.08 e non sono non sono ancora partita ma non ho ricevuto una seconda mail più o meno 10 min fa che mi avvertiva di un successivo ritardo di ulteriori 2 ore. Come minimo la compagnia avrebbe dovuto fornire dei voucher per acquistare il pranzo e così è stato, peccato che i voucher coprono una spesa di 4€ e nell’aeroporto di skiathos per quella cifra non ci si compra quasi neppure un caffè. Terminando sono ancora qui aspettando di partire con un pranzo costosissimo che ho dovuto comprare con i miei soldi sperando di non ricevere un’ulteriore mail 5 min prima del mio volo che mi avverta di un altro ritardo!

### "I wonder how this airline still operates"
Not Verified |  I wonder how this airline still operates. Possibly the worst company on planet earth. Cancelled flights, no compensation, no customer service to even know flights’ status. I wish I could rate with a 0.

### "Still hoping to see my money back"
I couldn't even fly because they cancel the flight less than 2 days before departure. The real annoying thing is they didn't provide the cash reimbursement which i asked for immediately. Apparently this option is available only until the day of supposed flight and they missed to accomplish it. So after few days I started requesting the 120% refund in Wizz personal account (like money you can spend for future bookings). Well it's almost one month from the date of supposed flight now, and my account is not yet funded. After few days they will be officially in delay. I wanted to book another flight but i have no credit for that! Many phone operators told me different things in the same day. They promised that within one month, one week, or one said even 1 day, the account would have shown my credit, and this was weeks ago but so far nothing. Still hoping to see my money back somehow.

### "experience is horrible"
Try to avoid this airline at all costs. They will delay or cancel your flight with a 99% probability. On top of that, you can not communicate with them. They provide a chat bot that has zero answers, and when you ask for a human agent, there is nobody available ever. (I waited two times, the first for 4hours and the second for 5 hours, and still no human agent was available). Your other option is premium Tel number at 1 point something euro per minute!!! These people are trying to overcharge you with premium chat line charges EVEN FOR THEIR DELAYS. My flight was delayed by 24 hours, then by an additional 4, with zero support. Ground stuff are rude and insulting. Yes, the tickets are cheap. But you will end up paying for hotel stays, meals etc, as well as missing out on your holidays. So overall value for money is truly bad. Seats are good as the plane is new. Staff on the plane are tired and inattentive. Overall experience is horrible

### "never fly with this airline again"
Not Verified |  I will never fly with this airline again! Their customer service is appalling. Even though we paid for seats with extra leg room we were reallocated seats when we arrived as they said we could not have the pre-booked seats because they were exit seats and one of us was arthritic. Put right to the back of the plane where we had a stewardess who spent most of her time sitting down texting on her phone and doing her expenses. The steward was more interested in eating a Snickers bar than doing anything else. So really cramped and painful flight and to cap it all the airline is making it impossible to communicate with anyone or thing to get a refund for the seats we paid for. This airline doesn’t our business and hopefully won’t be in business themselves for much longer. Buyer beware!

### "experience was a complete nightmare"
Not Verified |  Landed in a completely different country. Latvia instead of Lithuania, offered only a replacement bus then all staff disappeared and the bus took 3 hours to arrive to take us another 3 hours to Vilnius. The whole experience was a complete nightmare and the staff were rude through out it, will never travel with them ever again.

### "They are a nightmare company"
Wizz Air canceled my flight few hours before departure, leaving me without alternative options, without customer support as they can not be reached through any channels. On top of that I had to purchase ticket 3 times more expensive to get to my destination and wait 30 days for a refund. They are a nightmare company. Stay away!

### "I tried to get money back"
Not Verified |  My flight was cancelled by the carrier. I tried to get money back, but none of the links on their website function. They simply made another reservation for the same flight, a bit cheaper and reimbursed me for the difference (10% of the original price), and closed the case?? There is no way to contact them, and they even charge you for calling their customer service and outrageously high rate (and let you wait until giving up). From where I'm sitting this is nothing but an organized crime covered by terrible service. No authority seems to care enough to check this company but I wholeheartedly hope they are at least safe to fly with and not as nearly as bad as with serving customers. By the way, one star is minimum, but I'd rather opt for - (minus) 10

### "never flying this horrid airline again"
Let myself be tricked into flying Wizz due to their attractive prices (at first glance) and limited air traffic options between Stockholm and Budapest. What a mistake… Terrible from start to finish. A flight that was supposed to leave BUD at 7:00 was delayed to 8, then to 9. Information provided was minimal and conflicting with the text messages we received. The plane that ended up taking us to Stockholm had been standing on the ground in BUD since 1am that night, so why we were delayed in the first place remains a mystery. Beyond the delay, another reason for me never to use Wizz again is their appalling additional charges. If you think Ryanair and EasyJet are bad, just consider the fact that Wizz makes you pay for sitting together with your travel companions on the same booking. A romantic trip for two? Don’t take Wizz, because you’ll end up spending your flight time on opposite ends of the plane unless you pay. Absolutely disgusting, never flying this horrid airline again. They seem to maximise their delays to the limits of when compensation is due and do everything in their power to squeeze money out of their customers whilst providing the lowest levels of service possible. Please avoid if you can, they don’t deserve your money.

### "delayed just short of 4 hours"
We flew to Madeira on 9 September our flight was delayed more than 90 minutes, now we are returning and our flight is delayed just short of 4 hours. The airline compensates you with a whole €4 for food and drinks, you cannot even buy a sandwich with that amount of money. Absolutely disgusting we now sit 7 hours in the airport waiting for our flight. Disgusting and not even a message on our app or email with regards to the delay. If I could give a minus rating I would. When we land in London how do we get transport it is going to cost us £150 to get a taxi from the airport to home. But not a word from the airline.

### "cancel flight last minute"
Will never book a flight with Wizz Air. They cancel flight last minute, than you have to rebook a very expensive flight to get back home, all your plans are messed up and money wasted. And good luck with the refund!

### "120 euro to be checked in at the airport"
The online system did not allow me to do the check in online, I called customer service who was unable to help me over the phone, for some reason they could not explain to me. The only option I was left with was to go and try to check in at the airport, where by the way, no Wizz Air representative was available! So, I arrived at the airport (with two small children! ), only to be told that I have to pay 120 euro to be checked in at the airport, otherwise I will not be able allowed in the plane to return to our home in the UK. I called the customer care line, who reassured me that I should pay the exorbitant fee, keep the receipt and just request a refund once back in the UK. Which I did and the reply was that "I should have read your terms and conditions and have completed the online check in, as per your terms and conditions". I have since read many cases where people have been conned in paying the airport check in fee after they could not check in online, due to a fault in the online check in system! This is not a way to run a business, this is fraud! Wizz Air should be ashamed to treat your customers like this and get away with this! This is complete scam. In 4 months I had no help and support with my claim from the airline. My complained has not been addressed at any point. They do not have a complain practice as my complain has not been escalated.

### "impossible to get hold of anyone"
Not Verified |  Cancelled inbound flight 10 hours before take off, no support at airport and impossible to get hold of anyone. Managed to book on a flight 2 days later. 3 months on still waiting for compensation and reimbursement. No communication still and even harder to talk to anyone. The ADR won't do anything until a final decision has been issued, the industry need to have better controls in place for disgraceful companies like this. Do not fly Wizz!

### "my flight was cancelled"
I had a flight from Rome (where I do not live) to London and I didn't find out until I arrived to the airport three hours in advance that my flight was cancelled. I was then offered nothing but a hotel voucher so that I can 'find my way out of Rome. I lost so much money buying a last-minute flight out of Rome. I have since contacted Wizz Air multiple times to request a refund and all their twitter team does is provide me broken links. Their customer service in the airport was appalling as well. Do not book with this scamming airline.

### "the last time choosing this company"
I want to mention that I fly with Wizz approximately 2 times a month, and this year was a disaster. Almost all the flights which I’ve been on were delayed, sometimes up to 3 hours. The personnel were not helpful at all, every time lying about the time. Or if you ask questions, about complaining they avoid to answer. I start feeling that they fly between the serious companies, which really respect their customers and do everything for their flights to be on time. Last experience was the last one for me choosing this unprofessional company, which have interest only for taking your money, after that you don’t matter for them. Because a redirected flight, I lost my connection to my final destination, I lost my rental car, and my hotel and I had to book a hotel in the new destination and a new flight for the next day for my final destination and another rental car. Besides that they kept us waiting in the new destination airport (which was not the plan)like sheep, while everyone asked questions about what’s happening. No one knew anything, so I get frustrated. All this coming after another flight with Wizz Air where my flight was delayed 3 hours just the day before. And the last one was when I come back after the long story. At the gate I went with the same backpack which I fly with all the time, but this time I had to pay because my backpack was literally 5cm bigger. It’s every time about money and no respect. I can assure you, that is the last time choosing this company.

### "will never fly Wizz Air again"
Never again Wizz Air! The airline knew we had a 2.5 hour delay but boarded our flight on time. We then sat on the tarmac in Budapest for 2.5 hours while we waited for the expected delay to pass (all flights to London Gatwick were delayed due to weather or other issues on there end). During the 2.5 hours of sitting on the tarmac, we were right outside of the terminal? I won't even go into the boarding process and their lack of use of the jetway, when the plane was parked right next to the jetway! I will never fly Wizz Air again.

### "the planes both ways were FILTHY"
Not Verified | Cardiff to Alicante. The airline was on time there and back. That's the good part. The bad part is the planes both ways were FILTHY. The floors were covered in trash and the seat trays had dried food on them. Thank goodness I had wet wipes on me to clean the tray and surrounded area. The worst part was the toilet. It wasn't that they weren't tidy and restocked but the actual toilet themselves looked like they has not been cleaned for ages. I would not choose to fly with them again.

### "I would never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. I would not even give this headline one star. Our flight from Austria to Gatwick Airport cancelled at the last minute. There was no one to let us know what we need to do next. We were with our 2 young kids. And we ended up paying £2230.00 to book another flight with British Airways to come back. Wizz airline is the worst airline with terrible customer service. I would never use this airline again.

### "Poor customer service"
Vienna to Gatwick. Wizz Air - hate this name. Terrible airline. Flight cancelled after luggage was checked in and without any notification. Poor customer service. Rebooked flight and paid again. Please do not book with this airline.

### "personnel was very insulting"
Very bad airline. Only one person to manage luggage for the entire flight. Came 3 hours in advance. Was still on the line waiting for luggage to be uploaded 30 minutes after departure. They canceled my boarding just after I put the luggage, the flight went of with my luggage. Denied boarding even if I did everything to go to the boarding gate as fast as possible. The personnel was very insulting. No support from Wizz Air. No one was responding in their call centers (1 euro per minute of call). I had to book another flight through SWISS last minute. Waiting for reimbursement.

### "impossible to communicate with Wizz Air"
It is impossible to communicate with Wizz Air. Call centers rates are very high, online agents are always buzzy, the chatbot can't handle specific questions and internet complaint forms are not functioning. I want to inquire about the status of a refund that I haven't received, but is not possible

### "left us stranded without any info or help"
My journey as a family of 2 adults and 2 children was to travel from Bergen to Tenerife through Wizzair and LOT airlines in this sequence. As I didn’t find any available direct flights to Tenerife by the time of booking the tickets in April 2022. First, I booked a flight for 4 passengers from Bergen to Gdansk  with WizzAi, which is canceled by Wizzair after the planned departure time). I have booked one night in a hotel in Gdansk on 25/06/2022. Bought 4 tickets for the whole family with LOT Airlines from Gdansk to Warsaw in order to take another aircraft to Tenerife. Booked another 4 tickets from Warsaw to Tenerife through Wizz Air at the end. On the planned day we went to Bergen Airport. The departure time was at 14.05. We received a sms from Wizz Air  the flight is delayed and the estimated departure will be: 14.40, then another sms at 14.27 that the flight was delayed again and the new departure will be at 16.00, then another sms about a new delay to 16.30. At 14.47 they sent sms that the flight was canceled without mentioning the reason for cancellation. No one from WizzAir was in the airport to inform us what to do and no one called us. We went home with our kids again and tried to contact Wizz Air. After 45 minutes waiting over the phone with a paid phone call, they said that there are no other available flights, and we must send them a claim form to get a refund. I tried on my own to find another solution, and I found a flight at 22.40 to travel to another city in Poland (Katowice) where I could rent a car and drive 4 hours to Warsaw in order to catch the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife on the second day. I called them again to rebook this flight, and they assured me that everything is OK. I got the same confirmation number, I rented a car and paid online from Katowice Airport to drive with my family over the night to Warsaw as we did not find a hotel to accommodate us. We went to Bergen Airport again with our kids. The new boarding was at 22.40 on Saturday 25/06/2022, but they told us that the flight was delayed and then was also canceled without giving any reason. No one from Wizz Air was in the airport, the same as for the first time. Just those from Bergen airport gave us a paper stating our rights and they said that Wizzair will contact us, but no one has contacted us. I called WizzAir again. They couldn't find any other alternative flights, and asked me to send them a claim to get a refund and any other expense that I lost due to the two cancellations. I received a SMS at 06.00 am that the flight was canceled. (7 hours after the scheduled departure time). As a result of that , we could not travel to Poland and we missed the hotel accommodation, the flight from Gdansk to Warsaw, the car rental fee in Katowice and on top of that we missed the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife. I searched again and again and I found another route with another airline and of course the price was doubled. The original price was around 9000 Norwegian krone. The only available tickets that I found cost over 20000 NOK. I had to book it. WizzAir left us stranded without any info or help.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever. They cancelled the flight and informed us during check in, they don't have a solution, many of their flights got cancelled, their customer service seem to not like it that you called to complain even. They are not reliable and a joke, I filed for a full refund and don't even know if I will get it or not, they said they will send a confirmation email and didn’t. I drove from Dubai to Abu Dhabi to fly with them and this is how it ended, imagine if u have children or seniors with you.

### "Terrible customer service"
Cancelled my flight one hour before flight, and no response in email either on phone. Terrible customer service, and no refund. Never will fly again with this company.

### "I am forever grateful"
The staff at the Belgrade airport is incredibly helpful and kind. Three young men went above and beyond to help me find my lost luggage before it was time for me to board my wizz air flight. Another airline lost my luggage and these guys did so much research and called many different departments and walked across the airport through construction and hot weather to help me resolve this incredibly stressful situation. I am forever grateful.

### "a filthy operating airline"
Not Verified |  One has never trusted these low cost carriers and now I know why. Flights - hotels - transfers all booked months in advance. 12 hours prior to departure an email saying flight cancelled - no reason - advised of their wonderful options of 20 % extra bonus to cancel and refly with them or a never ending refund. Attempted their call centre to wait on hold for 35 minutes to get an answer of “ye” .. calmly opened open the conversation with “our flight was cancelled“ to a reply of “oh well call other number” and hung up. You’ve successfully ruined a trip - cost us hotels - non refundable and hours of chasing for options which would result in 1000 euro plus in costs - which at last minute prices are not worth it Is it worth the stress and upset to chase and get a reply of decency? Not a hope - you are the ones who have been treated like rubbish and they know i . Stay clear - a filthy operating airline and to be avoided.

### "very cost effective airline"
We flew with Wizz Air today, I had my daughter and disabled elderly father with me who has Alzheimer’s and uses a wheelchair as can only walk a few steps. From booking to landing I had regular updates through the App, the cabin crew were extremely helpful and kind, especially with my father when he became a bit worried and near by lady who was very scared of flying, they made what were very difficult circumstances for me pleasant. Yes they are low budget eg no film, radio, meal however they are a very cost effective airline, I will definitely fly with them again and recommend them highly based on my experience.

### "flight attendants were curt and not friendly"
Not Verified |  I don't usually leave reviews, however I think it may help other passengers predict and plan their own trips, and it would have been helpful had I been better prepared. We chose to fly with Wizz Air primarily because of the flight times that suited our schedule. Checking in was fine, there were hidden costs that can be expected from budget airlines. I downloaded the App which was not helpful as I had to constantly find the email with my code to access any part of the app. Finding the email was also a challenge as Wizz Air had sent me tons of promotional junk emails. Anyway, all that aside, we were on our merry way. On both flights the luggage check in queue was enormous. We arrived 3 hours before our flight which was not international and were almost late because of the queue. We only queued to tag our pram as we were travelling light, but there was no one to ask and it was not clear on the site. Both flights there was only one staff member for premium and one staff member for economy so either way the queue was ridiculous. Fine, we thought we had the time as Wizz Air (on both trips) had texted to say the flight was delayed. However none of the airport gate signs indicated the flight was delayed so after rushing through, skipping any sort of food with a baby we made it to the gate to leave. The airport sign actually said 'gate closing' but when we arrived there was just a lot of people sitting on the floor wondering what was going on. Eventually after about an hour an announcement that the cabin crew were in the airport was made, but no indication of how long was given. On our outbound flight we waited for an hour and half and ransacked the vending machine to feed our family and on the return flight we must have waited over 2 hours, again in a waiting area with very little seating, I had to stand for almost 2 hours with a 2 year old whilst being almost 7 months pregnant. Not fun. The plane itself was fine. The flight attendants were curt and not friendly. One even threw my receipt down on me whilst serving someone else. Anyway. just a heads up to anyone using the airline.

### "refused to refund the €70 for check in"
Not Verified |  Never Again! We tried to check in on 3 devices and the app was not working at all. When we arrived at the airport, they charged us €70 to"check in for our flight (it was our honeymoon and our ticket were €600). There was no Wizz staff at all at the airport. I called and wrote Wizz Air many times and escalated it to the EU authorities. Long story short, Wizz refused to refund the €70 for the check in due to their faulty app, and their mails were filled with accusations (that we were lying), offensive insults (implying we were too stupid to use the app), and total lack of understanding or interest at all. I will never fly with Wizz again. I don't mind if a company makes a mistake, but it's how they deal with the mistake that separates the good service providers from the bad.

### "call center and live chat do not work"
Tirana to Abu Dhabi. My flight was cancelled 3 times. Wizz Air call center and live chat do not work and they don't respond. 1- I was supposed to go to Tirana from Abu Dhabi at 12 August but the flight got cancelled while I was on the airport. 2- After that I rebooked for 17 August but that flight also got cancelled while I was INSIDE THE AIRPLANE! 3- Today is 19 August, I received multiple emails that the flight is cancelled (I can not even rebook because on the mobile app it does not say cancelled). I again went to the airport for the THIRD time and they confirmed that for the THIRD time this flight is cancelled. The next flight is on 22 August and after 3 hours of trying to reach the company, the call center told me its unsure if this flight will depart or will be cancelled for the forth time.

### "announcement further delayed to 09:00"
Booked with Wizz Air as earliest flight out to Malaga on Friday 19th August 2022 at 06:05 only to receive a text message at 01:01 delayed 1 hour 40 minutes to 07:45, then at airport informed by Gatwick Staff of another delay at 08:45 as no Cabin Manager due to tube strike ( a lame excuse). Then another announcement further delayed to 09:00. Unacceptable!

### "the service was good"
We boarded on time, the service was good, it has no competition in terms of value, I recommend it.

### "I really cannot stress how awful the whole experience was"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever! We booked tickets to Dubrovnik and ended up not only delayed but in the wrong city! They landed us in Zagreb, we ended up stranded at 2am with airline staff saying they didn’t know why the flight had not gone to the original destination. After arriving in Zagreb we were promised we would be coached to Dubrovnik through the night, no coach arrived. We were 500 miles from our destination. We decided to hire a car with other stranded passengers and we drove through the night with no knowledge of the country and help from the airline! I really cannot stress how awful the whole experience was.

### "worst experience ever with an airline"
This is the worst experience ever with an airline. Check-in online was not possible 3 hours and 6 minutes before flight. At the desk not only we could not check in but we had to go to the ticket office to pay for check-in 40€ per person and go back to the check-in desk. Plus if you lose the flight because of this they will charge you another 7€ per person for the no show. If you wish to change the ticket you will pay for a new ticket there is no penalties but you loose the whole amount for the previous ticket. They are robbers and there is also no customer service to help you out.

### "Worst customer service"
They change the date of my booking and there's no alternative, when I request to cancel it they deduct more money from my amount while it's there mistake to change the date. Worst customer service, waiting on hold for 43 minutes after they replied and then hang up the call.

### "the worst experience we ever had"
We planned our summer vacation using Wizz Air. We purchased our return tickets from Rome to Budapest for 19 July and from Budapest to Baku for 20 July. We had one whole day so that there is no rush and so that kids don’t suffer much from long flight. The flight from Rome to Budapest on 19 July was delayed a few times during the day and finally when we reached the check in we got notified that the flight for that day got cancelled. After a long waiting time at the airport with two hungry kids it was very stressful to receive this message. Even though we called Wizz Air and told them that we had Baku flight the next day and we wouldn’t be able to catch that flight, they didn’t help us and said that it was not their problem. It was quite rude and unpleasant and we were in despair, as there was no ticket available to the next flight from Budapest to Baku either. We had to purchase very expensive tickets from another airlines to travel back home. This was the worst experience we ever had.

### "charge you 18€ per basic seat"
The worst airline, they charge you 18€ per basic seat. They try to work you around to get a checked in baggage concealing the cabinet option. Recent experience: - an insurance by my name didn't result to the insurer, although I bought it in full embedded with the ticket. I had a flex ticket and wanted to change a flight due to instability in the area. I went to the see the available flights and noticed I would have had to pay another sum that would have amounted for one third of the original ticket. So I went to have my money refunded to my Wizz air account and found that no booking was on my dashboard.

### "Awful experience!"
Not Verified |  Awful experience! Cancelling the flight 4h before the flight. No replacement of same day flight and not covering you any additional expenses. Avoid this company on any cost!

### "cancelled our flight a couple of hours before"
We never actually flew because Wizz Air cancelled our flight a couple of hours before. This route had been cancelled around 30% of the time and rest landed late. Trying to rebook or get a refund online is impossible and doesn't work despite them keeping on directing you to do that. Contacting Wizz Air is also impossible and made extremely difficult, they encourage you to call their premium rate number but don't make clear you can call their "special assistance" number for free when delays or cancellation are involved. You then have to wait hours to finally speak to someone. They offered us a flight a week later which would have meant missing most of our holiday - we stupidly accepted as we were put on the spot. We tried calling back to get a refund when we realised our mistake but they wouldn't allow us to get a refund. We are due compensation under EU law regardless for the delay, but they don't care about the law and get away with it because civil aviation authorities don't do anything despite them breaching the law all the time. They also refused to tell us the reason for the delay. You think you will save money but you will ultimately be out of pocket with this airline, not to mention the stress and destruction of your holiday. One of the worst airlines in Europe that treat customers with absolute contempt - avoid.

### "Customer service is useless"
Not Verified |  They cancelled our flight back to London from Faro and only informed us less than 4 hours before. It's been nearly two months and I am yet to receive the refund for the new flights we had to buy from another airline very last minute at an extremely high cost. Customer service is useless. May as well talk to a tree and you'll get a better response. This is actually just ridiculous.

### "flight today was virtually flawless"
Sofia to Larnaca. I am surprised by the barrage of negative reviews. My flight today was virtually flawless, from check-in all the way through arrival. Departure was more or less on time. The announcements were helpful and cheerful. The crew were tall strong males (surely a bonus in an emergency), bilingual, calm and polite. The snacks I bought onboard tasted great. We landed on time and my luggage came out within minutes. Well done Wizz Air; I won't hesitate to fly with you again in the near future.

### "Customer service was horrendous"
We didn’t even get on the plane! Customer service was horrendous and basically no one cared that we had just had our flight cancelled after telling us there was a slight delay — just announced the cancelled flight and waved us goodbye. Waited ages to speak to someone who just kept repeating that we all had to sort out the problem online and they couldn’t do anything to help and we had to sort it all out for ourselves online — fobbing everyone off! They offered to put us up in a hotel but only one 30 miles in Reigate apparently — definitely a ploy to put people off of taking them up on the offer? Why not the airport hotels? Fully booked - too expensive more like. Absolutely gutted as it would have been our first trip abroad with our children who are now 3 and 5 and were very much looking forward to having their first holiday which has been cancelled 3 years in a row due to the pandemic — we can’t even rebook flights as all sold out, and other airlines are triple the price at this late notice and have now lost out on our accommodation in Tenerife. An absolute disgusting joke of an airline.

### "Absolutely horrendous experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. Waited for 90 minutes at check in with my autistic son. When I asked if we could pass the line I was told no you’ll need to wait or take him for a walk and come back when it’s quieter. I was later told by passenger services that he should have been allowed through. Flight was also delayed and no one told us while the entire flight sat at the gate waiting to bored. Will never use again.

### "not thinking to go with this airline anymore"
Booked two tickets for me and for my wife through Wizz website to go to Budapest, then my wife decided to take our little daughter with us. She is 10 years old I tried to book for her in the website but I couldn't because there is no option to make a reservation for a child in their website so I booked for her as an adult ticket. Things went smoothly in Dubai airport in Wizz check-in counter. But in the way back in Budapest airport, there is one lady in the check-in counter wanted thing to be difficult for us. She said that your daughter ticket was booked as an adult ticket and I can't see her name in the system and you need to book another ticket for her and the Hungarian custom are very strict about this. I told her there was no issues in Dubai airport and they said it's ok they just adjust her date of birth with nothing more. Then she asked about her vaccination report I told her I'm going home and they don't request vaccination report or even PCR test. She was looking for anything just to make it more difficult for us. After that she told me to wait few minutes for the Hungarian airline reply. Few minutes she left her desk so I went to other guy working in special assistance desk I gave him the passport and the booking number. He wrote the details of ticket and he pointed to the service desk behind me and told me to go there. I went there within One minute the lady gave me back my documents. And she told me everything is fine you can go and take your boarding card. I couldn't believe how easy and fast was that. I'm not thinking to go with this airline anymore.

### "book with reliable airlines"
Like everyone, we looked for a cheap ticket and booked Wizz Air without knowing the airline. When we tried to check-in online, the system said that the seat selection is not possible at this time. Without it, you cannot proceed. So we were not able to check in online (despite trying several times). At the airport, you won’t have to pay the 13€ they advertise online, but rather a whooping 40€ per person. The fun part is, that they have no personnel at the airport and the numbers that the airport staff has, do not work either. So you can pay the fee or call the call center for just 2-3€ per minute. It’s a planned scam. So don’t do the same mistake we did and book with reliable airlines.

### "An awful experience"
Not Verified |  An awful experience. The plane was 2 hours late on the way out and almost the same delay on the return. The staff were rude and uninterested in passenger's concerns arising from what became a very late evening return, at a time when public transport options were very limited.

### "my last touch with this airline"
Not Verified |  After being checked and going trough the passport control we were told that our flight was canceled. We ended up rebooking the new flight by paying additional $200 to be able to have five days that we planned. On our way back waited 5 hrs because of the delay, and rest of the experience I would never wished anyone to go through. This was my first and my last touch with this airline.

### "Absolutely awful customer service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely awful customer service. They are always with issues, make you stand in queue to 'check documents' which is basically garbage customer service and cant be bothered to open said check in desks till 2 hours before departure. The curt and dismissive attitude makes everything 10times worse. Do yourself a favour and choose a carrier that cares, which is definitely not Wizz Air.

### "worst travel experience ever"
We had the worst travel experience ever, it was my first flight with my wife and we got stuck inside the plane for 4 hours waiting to resolve an issue with infants being allowed to enter the plane while they are not. It was a disaster. This would be my last booking with wizz air. In addition, my bag was damaged.

### "never waste my money on this airline again"
Flight W65520, scheduled for July 17 at 10:30 pm, was consecutively postponed, until at 3 am on July 18 it was canceled and rescheduled to 3 pm on that day. There was no support from the airline with hotels, transfers and food. I had a connecting flight on the 18th at 6:40 am to Brindisi, which I missed and Wizz Air did not take any responsibility. How is it possible for such a company to fly within the EU? I will never waste my money on this airline again. They lost a customer forever.

### "plane was quiet and pleasant"
My flight was delayed by 3 hours, not due to Wizz Air, but it did make the whole flight a little stressful. I found the seats to be rather stiff and uncomfortable, but the tickets were cheap. The plane was quiet and pleasant, clean and new looking. Found the staff to be helpful and communicative, the pilot kept us very informed on when we would be flying and what the hold up was

### "reimbursement is in Wizz Air credits"
Group booking 20 seats. Flight on August 10 Paris Larnaca canceled on July 8 without proposal to relocate except to fend for yourself. The only possibility of reimbursement is in "Wizz Air credits" ie. a voucher. To be reimbursed, you must call a paying phone number,  waiting hours, operators trained to drag out to make passengers pay, cutting off communications when finalizing the refund. 3 weeks later, new calls under the same conditions, where I am told that without know why, the reimbursements have not gone away and that it is impossible to have the information.

### "an awful experience with Wizz Air"
I had an awful experience with Wizz Air, actually, multiple experiences. Our first flight from BEG to Malmo was cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19. We got Wizz credit to be used in the next two years. We tried to use the credit in Feb 2022 and they cancelled our flight from Frankfurt Hahn to Belgrade. Next, I wanted to fly from Frankfurt Hahn to Belgrade on 1 July 2022, they cancelled this one as well, only a few hours before the flight when I had already driven 130 km from Luxembourg, left my car key in the safe on the parking which I haven't retrieved 3 weeks later! I am completely discouraged to ever fly with this company. It cost me time, fuel, accommodation, numerous emails, complaints, I never ever want to see their email in my inbox. In addition, they don't want to return our money which is now in Wizz credit saying that we opted for credit two years ago! Yes, but they are not giving us a chance to use it. I had 44.950 rsd which is around 380 eur, now, 2 years later, without even flying anywhere, we are left with 24.000 rsd (around 200 eur), plus fuel, accommodation and other expenses. No, I don't want such service! I am done with them.

### "atrocious attitude of the staff"
Deplorable. Absolutely would not recommend, we took a flight from Milan to Santorini. As our flight to reach Milan was slightly delayed we arrived at the check in counter for wizz slightly over an hour before the flight, staff at check-in counter said we had to pay 40€ to check in as their check-in was apparently supposed to be online and online check-in was ‘closed’. What kind of airline charges for something as basic checking in? Moreover before boarding they conducted arbitrary ‘checks’ on passengers baggages and was made to pay 30€/person under the pretext that our bags do not fit under the seat, worst part is the atrocious attitude of the staff. Disgusting service, will never fly this airline again. Altogether these additional charges cost as much or more than the flight itself.

### "Absolutely atrocious customer service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely atrocious customer service, please do not fall for their cheaper fair as they will be robbing you of your money and cancelling your flight last minute without any reimbursement. Customer service costs money/minute, yet the agents keep you on hold for 40 minutes then hang up. I booked a ticket for 5 family members as they were visiting me from Canada and I wanted to take them to Rome, was all excited to show them Europe, yet Wizz air ruined it by cancelling the departing flight from Rome, leaving us in shambles as they would only refund the departing flight, yet by this point all other flight options were 3-4 times the price and we needed 5 tickets. Called them several times, only to be put on hold and then hung up on, despite being charged for the calls per minute. These were 30-40 minute calls. Basically got zero help from them and wasted my money on the flights and hotels in the next city as the times no longer matched. Definitely never using this airline again and will not be recommending it to others. Please avoid at all costs. Pay more and save yourself the hassle.

### "customer service is so disrespectful"
Worst airline in the world. I am so frustrated with how everything was handled by the airline on a canceled flight. Its crazy how you made people wait for 5hours delaying the flight, then made everyone wait at the gate for 2 hours when you knew you won’t board and flight was canceled long time ago. No one turned up at the desk, no help, no info on how to pick up your check in bag. No help booking transportation or hotel in the middle of the night after canceling the flight and delaying for 8h! No staff available to help! No connection in Luton airport for phone, internet to let our loved once know we are ok. No staff to tell us the flight was cancelled, no information on the board- just to go to the gate! Your customer service is so disrespectful, disgusting and didn’t even say sorry to hear about what happened. After hours waiting on the phone I got screamed at and then hanged up on… ! !! Plus the phone line is 1.45£ per minute.

### "cancel just 30 min before we have our flight"
How can this airline be so cruel with the people who is giving their money to get a service, how can this airline can give us a message that our flights is cancel just 30 min before we have our flight. Okay i understand that the temperature it is so high this two days but at least give us the message 1 day before or 2 hours so we can see what to do and to not come at airport because is so far away for us.

### "most hellish experience I have ever had"
Wizz Air is the most hellish experience I have ever had. They cancelled my flight the moment I showed up at the airport after having to walk an hour to get there. I had payed for insurance against that but all they offered was 1 night in a hotel and a refund despite me reiterating i had to get a flight home the same day as i had another one early next morning so i could not do that. The staff were rude and disinterested and originally sent me to the Ryanair desk at the other end of the airport saying they would help me. The Ryanair staff frustratedly told me and everyone else they had sent there it had nothing to do with them. I think it is outrageous a company can get away with blatantly not offering the service they advertise.

### "The level of service was appalling"
Our flight from Luton to Santorini (10/07/22) was delayed in take off by three hours. We arrived in Santorini too late for the (latest) 11.00 p.m. car pick up. This meant we spent 40 Euros (taxi fare) to travel to our accommodation. We then had to spend another 40 Euros in the morning to travel back to the airport to collect our car. In addition we only received a bottle of water and a kitkat on the plane as compensation - not a meal as specified in their conditions. Our return flight (17/07/22) landed four hours late - adding a £30 additional cost to our transport home. The level of service was appalling. On the return journey no reason was given for the four hour delay. It can only have been a Wizz Air issue as a RyanAir Flight at 9.20 p.m. took off on the same route only 6 minutes late. On the outward journey the cabin crew were surly, rude and offensive. They refused to answer questions from multiple customers about the delay. They literally threw kitkats at customers when handing them out. One said openly to someone sitting behind us ... "We are rude to the customers because they are rude to us. Customers were not rude - they were only asking genuine questions. The service was the worst I have ever seen - not just when flying. Customers deserve better. I hear that most complaints are ignored. The problems were all with Wizz Air - no other flights had these lengths of delay. Communication was non-existent. There was no real attempt to explain or compensate customers. I will never travel with Wizz Air again.

### "be lucky if you get on that plane"
I was traveling with my family from Larnaca to Tel Aviv and I had 2 children and a baby. It took sometime for security check but we were not that late. They called us to the gate and in 30 seconds we were there. We waited there till they took care of another family. When I get to the man at the counter he said you will be lucky if you get on that plane. I said what are you serious I can see the plane from the window and the family that were standing in line before us just got on the plane so I said don’t do this to me I am with a baby. He started talking to his colleague in Greek but I could understand that he said I will not let him on that plane because he thinks I did not talk to him properly. Anyway he took us back to the airport and said now you have to find another plane and left me at the airport helpless with 2 children and a baby and all this because I did not beg him to let me on the plane and because I said he is the plain with the stairs it did not take off yet and I said here are people waiting like me and they got on the plane.

### "I’m utterly shocked"
The flight was due to take off at 16:20, everything was loaded and ready to go before a security team had to come on board to remove a rowdy customer which delayed the departure till 16:50. We were in Dubrovnik airspace when the captain informed us that the weather conditions were bad and we circled the airport for 45 minutes before being diverted to Zagreb. We were informed by the captain that there would be a coach to take us to Dubrovnik airport which is a 600km drive (between 6-9hours!) Once we finally disembarked at Dubrovnik at around 10:30pm we were met by nobody, there wasn’t a representative from Wizz Air or anyone else, we were left for 75 minutes not knowing where to go or what to do. At 11:45pm a bunch of coaches arrived at which point mayhem ensued! People scrabbling it get on, and we could only hope that it was for Dubrovnik as the driver spoke no English. We arrived in Dubrovnik at 10:15am, over 14 hours later than it was due to arrive. What should have been a 2:45 minute flight turned into a nearly 18 hours of hell. 10th July 2022 flight number W95174. We were informed in good time that our outbound flight from the original departure time of 20:50 to 21:50. But it was then delayed further to 22:34 and again to 23:29 and yet again to 00:39! And then after an hour of waiting we were informed that the flight had been cancelled and to come forward for 4 euro voucher. Yes 4 euros for waiting 4 hours, one euro per hour! Sometime later we told there would be a coach to take us to a hotel. The message from Wizz Air was to rebook or get a refund as the next flight out wasn’t till Wednesday the 13th of July. I ended up having to book a ticket to Amsterdam and then on to Gatwick and finally a train back to Luton Airport. Which added 13 hours to the trip. I’m utterly shocked by the way myself and fellow passengers were treated, it’s an utter disgrace, and I will personally never fly with Wizz Air again.

### "Wizz Air left us stranded without any info or help"
I booked with Wizz Air 4 tickets from Bergen to Gdansk. In order to travel to Warsaw with (another airline) on the second day, then to travel with Wizz Air from Warsaw to Tenerife in Canary Islands (Spain). When we were in Bergen Airport and just 1 hour before boarding, they announced that the flight will be delayed for 40 minutes and after a while it was delayed again for 2 hours. 1 hour again after the new date, they announced that the flight is canceled without giving any reason. No one from Wizz Air was in the airport to inform us what to do. We went home and tried to contact them. After 45 minutes waiting over the phone, they said that there's no other flights available, and we must send them a claim form to get a refund. I tried with my own to find out another solution, and I found a flight after 8 hours to travel to another city in Poland (Katowice) where I could rent a car to drive 4 hours to Warsaw in order to catch the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife. I called them again to rebook this flight, and they assured that everything is OK. We went to the Bergen Airport again with our kids, and 5 minutes before the new boarding, they told us that the flight is delayed and then is canceled also without giving any reason. I called them again, they couldn't find any other alternative flights. We couldn't of course travel to Warsaw and we missed the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife. I searched again and again and I found another route with another airlines and of course the price was tripled. I sent them a claim and they replied that the cancelation was because of extraordinary circumstances without mentioning what was the circumstances! Thus they can't offer a refund or compensation! I found that a lot of people complaining about similar issues with Wizz Air without getting any refund or compensation! I lost a lot of money, around 2500 euros. Wizz Air left us stranded without any info or help.

### "left me stranded in Slovakia"
The worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Flights cancelled 1 and a half hours before departure, left me stranded in Slovakia. Next available flight was three days later. Their website only allows a refund in Wizz credits and the process is seemingly deliberate in its attempt to confuse. Avoid at all costs.

### "No customer service"
Its amazing to find out on the local news that your plane was struck by lightning, but not from the company itself that chose the most perverted way to notify of a last minute canceled flight via e-mail. No customer service. To speak with a human representative you will have to pay 1+ euro per minute call and wait at least 40 minutes on the line, just to hear that you can submit a complaint via website only, and the website itself is a pure work of art. They made refund and compensation process as difficult as possible + they added very nice tech feature -> automatic page refresh in the middle of submitting the form because you're probably writing too much! 4 phone calls and each employee says something different, team synchronization is not their forte with absolutely no effort to do their minimum work responsibilities.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. They fleeced us for 120 Euros. When we tried checking in the night before the website claimed we couldn’t do it without our bags. When we show up there, they said oh you did not check in, that will be an extra 40 Euros per person! They even charged us for our 5 year old. When we said we could not check in earlier as the site didn’t allow us to do so without our bags accounted for they said that’s your problem. We asked to check in online then and there and they said go on and try- they won’t let you as it has to be done 24 hours earlier! What a gamut! What other airline does not allow you to check in online on the spot? It’s not like it’s costing them wages on personnel. Most others even allow 23 kegs per bag but this one only gives you 20. They are robbers and thieves. Please do not fly this cheap Airline with uncomfortable seats and scalping practices.

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever. Flight was canceled after boarding was announced. No help from Wizz Air at airport, we had to find a different flight for a next day ourselves and pay airfare 4 times more than we paid for Wizz Air. There is no customer service, phone lines don’t work from outside EU, online chat references to website which doesn’t work properly. I was not able to file a claim for compensation or for my refund.

### "the worst I had ever flown with"
My return flight from Chania to Vienna was booked originally for 7th July 2022, then WizzAir informed me that it was shifted from the 7th to 6th July 2022 without giving me no reason why, and after calling them, and confronting them with the fact, that I paid the hotel until 7th of July, they told me to make that out with the hotel, they are not responsible for that. Furthermore, when I did my booking with the airline, I chose a 20 kg baggage and they changed it to a 10 kg baggage, telling me, it was my mistake and I had to pay for the extra cost and on and on. I had a lot of troubles to get that all sorted out. This airline is the worst I had ever flown with! The customer service is absolutely a horror.

### "Not worth booking with them"
Terrible service. Flight cancelled, offered the option for a refund either to Wizz credits or to cash. Neither have been given, when I enter all of my details the box to submit claim remains greyed out. No customer service options, as 'All our agents are busy at the moment'. Every minute on their website feels like a scam. Not worth booking with them, the stress involves outweighs the holiday.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
My party and I are very disappointed with Wizz Air. We had just flown into Milan from New York and we were connecting to Cagliari, Sardinia in April 2022. We were sure to have our bags the allotted and accepted sizes. When we went to the Check-in Desk, the woman at the check-in in Milan said that we needed to purchase our boarding passes. She further stated that two of our bags were not compliant when indeed there were others identical that went through without being charged an extra hundred dollars. The folks traveling with us are 80 years old, one with a cane, and this woman showed no compassion. Because my phone was in airplane mode on the flight right before this, I was unable to check in within 3 hours prior to this flight. I had my tickets and barcode on my phone. She gave us two little pieces of paper and we had to go to this kiosk and wait 15 minutes in line to purchase two more boarding passes. We had purchased these tickets through e-Dreams where each time I purchased a ticket, the price went up. I paid an extra $125 for two more boarding passes. I was about to pay for my personal ticket but then I thought, I am going to go straight to the line and not go through that woman because I have my ticket. That worked for me, but the elderly couple were extremely distraught and upset over this experience. I ended up ordering two new tickets for them for the return trip. I double-ordered because I did not want to get saddled with another boarding pass fee. I did not use e-Dreams either this time and that helped. I contacted Customer Support a I do not like to write negative reviews, but they kept giving me the run-around. Incidentally, we got through with our bags on the return trip as we refused to go to the check-in desk and our bags were fine sidewise. The only thing going for this airline are the pretty flight attendants. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "error on the website"
Milan to Prague. Due to an error on the website when logging in, we were unable to check in for our flight online. All screenshots of this error were provided, the carrier also saw several of our attempts to register, but refuses to compensate for my loss due to the fault of the company. Also, SMS and email with an invitation to check-in were not sent for this flight. I would like to believe that this is a mistake, and not a humiliating way to make more money, and registration at the counter costs about 40 euros per person, which is more than the price of a ticket. (Also the flight was delayed for about 2 hours).

### "the worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever flying through Europe. They are cheap when you book but then they charge you even for the ticket. And when you want to check in or to pay online for something extra, the system won’t let you process the payment. Then you have to pay the big money at the counter. Totally disappointed!

### "I have never felt so neglected before"
Not Verified |  An absolute joke. The flight was delayed by 4 hours and after that they decided it was cancelled. Not only did they take ages to decide it was cancelled all other flights to Cyprus had already left and therefore the next available flight from them was on Thursday, nearly a week after. There was no representative at the Airport which I don't know how this is legal, as we had no guidance no nothing. People that needed hotels were never given any validation or any help. They need to rebook us onto the next available flight and they were completely useless. Lots of people lost their holidays just like that. It's funny how easy they will take money off of us for luggages being cm than the allowed dimensions but will not even speak to us when the cancel entire trips. I have never felt so neglected before! The customer service on the phone was also not helpful at all telling us we need to do this online. I have spent money on taxi to and from the airport and which I want compensation for and they never said anything. Absolutely disrespectful. The EU law says that passengers need to be cared for after cancellations which clearly has not happened.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. Before the flight we encountered issues with the online check-in and no customer service was available, the number provided on the website did not work. The check-in lines were horrendously long. The flight is currently delayed by over three hours, and they are forcing the passengers to wait on an overheated plane without even handing out water. Do not book with this airline.

### "worst airline I've ever used"
By far, the worst airline I've ever used. Customer service was appalling, with a very rude cabin crew and an unhelpful ground team. The flight was delayed for almost 3 hours for two reasons, according to the crew: a shortage of staff (!) and miscommunication regarding the boarding gate. As a result, boarding alone took almost an hour, and for those of us already boarded - while the staff scattered for passengers throughout the airport - not even a cup of water was offered! Horrible experience, from beginning to end. First and only time flying on this airline.

### "it was impossible to reach customer service"
Flight cancelled a few hours before departure with no options to rebook. I was in a terrible situation where I had to book last minute flights for 600-800 Euros, or stay one more week in Sweden to catch a flight that was "just" 300 Euros. Worst of all, it was impossible to reach customer service via chat or cost centre. To use the call centre, you have to pay 15 euros per transaction and 1.5 euros per minute.

### "Simply avoid this airline"
Completely ruined my holidays. We were supposed to fly Friday at 9.30pm but they kept delaying by 30min each time so they hold us hostage in the airport (knowing that the aircraft didn't leave Budapest at all) and that Orly closes at 11.30pm. After that they proposed a new flight on Saturday 11pm which departed 2 hours later. They refused to reimburse my hotel tickets, taxi, and even meals. They refused as well to pay due compensation. Simply avoid this airline. By email, they don't respond until months later, and when they do is to disrespect you.

### "gave me no compensation in the end"
After they cancelled my flight even after the departure time, without a provide a substitute flight, at 10pm, they said they would give us a compensation for the problem. All my holidays just imploded because of that! And they gave me no compensation in the end, they just closed the claim without provide anything.

### "3 days later and I still haven't had any information"
These guys are one of the worst airlines available right now. My flight was supposed to leave at 20.30 on a Sunday and at 12.30 I received a text letting me know that it was cancelled, if I wanted to rebook or refund go to the website and that my rights had been emailed to me. My rights were not emailed to me and upon going on the website to manage my booking, it did not reflect that the flight had been cancelled. It was still asking me to check in even though I already had that morning. They also didn't notify the travel agent. The airport website was also not updated until a few hours after the flight was supposed to depart. To top it off I couldn't get through to them on the phone. A really bad look is that the flight was still available to buy tickets for online which at that point is basically a scam. I also checked the same flight number for the few days after that and exactly the same. This airline know that these flights aren't going ahead and have no intention of fulfilling their contract with their customers yet they still take booking and continue to not provide support. 3 days later and I still haven't had any information. I had to then book a last minute BA flight.

### "supposed to check-in online"
I was travelling on the 7th June to Heraklion, Crete from Rome. When I got to the airport 3 hours before my flight, the staff informed me that your reservations for 4 people supposed to check-in online and it is going to cost us about 35 euros and we should head down to the ticket centre, where we waited for almost 2 hours in the Queue, I asked help from the Wizz Air staff but they responded completely unprofessional and rudely. Finally we paid all together 320 euro for 4 people, just to return back to the counter to get our boarding passes printed, then after reaching to the gate we find out that the flight is delayed for an hour. Completely destroyed the planning of our journey and wasted a lot of our time.

### "cancelled my flight few hours"
Avoid this company. They cancelled my flight few hours before the departure. It is impossible from the website and from the expensive phone number to ask for refund.

### "does not provide compensation and solutions to the problem"
Worst airline ever! This company simply receives money for tickets and cancels flights. My flight was first delayed and then completely cancelled. Of course, this situation occurs in many airlines, but these have been cancelling flights for more than a week in a row. My brother flew with his family the day after me and they had the same situation. First, their flight was delayed for 3 hours, then canceled altogether. Moreover, the evening flight was canceled, and my brother was flying with his little son. It's really terrible, especially when the flight is canceled and you're staying at the airport with the kids. The company absolutely does not provide compensation and solutions to the problem. I sincerely regret that I contacted this particular airline. Therefore, if you save your time, money and health, it is better not to contact this company.

### "Do Not fly with these people you will be sorry"
Outbound originally booked round trip from Luton to Larnaca / Larnaca to Luton - Luton being local airport. Problem no 1 - Flight departure changed to Gatwick - cost 2 x tickets national express £60. Problem no 2. Aircraft delayed for 9 hours - no food vouchers issues - no assistance - cost 2 light meals @ £20. Booking said check in at desk at Gatwick with suitcase - no issues. Inbound Problem no 3. Went to check in desk to book in at Larnaca - man at desk says - you need to book in online - was too late to book in on line had to leave check in queue and go to separate desk and pay 40 euro each extra - cost 80 euro and return to check in queue. No email reminder sent to check in online. Problem no 4 - Aircraft toilet seat was disgusting - not from passengers but from lack of attention of cleaning. Total extra cost to original ticket price around £160. Do Not fly with these people you will be sorry!

### "I'm stuck with no compensation and no refunds"
1) Wizz "encourage" you to forget to check in online by not reminding it. Failure to do so - pay £35 at the airport. 2) To pay this charge you need to go and queue again at the customer services after queueing to the check-in desk, then go back to the check-in desk and wait some more. 3) Experience of denied boarding when they over-booked - awful. Long wait not knowing what's happening, queueing again and again at customer service desk for hours, waiting for an hotel booked for hours. 4) The "hotel" provided was just one star above sleeping at the airport - a horrible place and a horrible room. A bed in a box. 5) Over 30 days after claiming my expenses and compensation to their complaints department - just one *standard* reply referring only to a quarter of my claims. No reply to further emails and no number to call them. I'm stuck with no compensation and no refunds. Pros: the aircraft flew ok.

### "Never again, Wizz Air"
This is not an airline. The delay takes so much of your time – almost as long as the actual flight. Before you arrive to the airport, you’ll have an email saying that the plane is delayed for around 1 hour. By the time you walk inside the airport lounge, there will be another delay for 35 minutes. When you are queuing for the gate and passport clearance, another 30 minutes. Then, just when you think you’ve finally made it inside the plane and ready to take off, they slap you with an additional 45 minutes delay. You get an almost 3 hours delay in what is supposed to be a 3.5 hours flight. You’d think by then at least they’ll give you free peanuts for compensation. If they could legally monetise your complaints and suffering, I bet they would. Yet I still consider myself getting a comparatively better flight experience, compared to what other reviewers are saying here. If you’re using online check-in, make sure you pay for the £2 option for “online check in”, even if they stated that online check in will be available “for free” 48 hours before flight. If you don’t pay, the website/app will display an error on the last step of your check in. Changing browser, clearing cache, or calling the customer service won’t help you. After you pay, however, the error magically goes away! I know now is that paying extra for a more reliable airline might really be worth it. Never again, Wizz Air.

### "I will never fly with Wizz air again"
I will never fly with Wizz air again. The cheap flights are not worth the risk of being screwed over by them. My flight was cancelled 12 hours before departure and we were stranded abroad. We had to book new flights through an alternative provider and stay an extra night without any assistance or compensation from WIZZ air. WIZZ air also make it extremely complicated to received a refund. You have to call their call centre which costs £1.40 a minute (depending where you’re calling from) if you want a refund in money rather than Wizz air vouchers, so in the end I had to pay £11 to call them and I still haven’t received my refund a week later! They are very discrete about the fact you are due compensation and the process to claim for it is complicated, with a response time of 30 days. I am still waiting to hear back as to whether I will receive anything but I’m not holding my breath…

### "they have just lost me forever"
I have flown Wizz Air before and know their policies. Today however, the flight is delayed for over 2.5 hours. I have received an email stating they will provide refreshments and food, but when asked at the counter they said we were not getting anything. Due to the delay caused by the airline alone, I am now spending my hard earned money on super expensive water and food at Belgrade airport, where their French owners, Vinci, only have warm water in the bathrooms so that customers could not even refill their bottles but instead have to continue paying 2 euro for a small bottle. Organized scammers is what they all are and show zero respect for customers. Well, they have just lost me forever as I will never fly them again.

### "I would not hesitate to fly Wizz Air again"
I found Wizz Air to be an excellent airline. From booking on the website to check in and service. I flew with my mother who needed assistance and she was looked after at London Gatwick and in Athens. The website is easy to navigate and I found the prices to be reasonable. I would not hesitate to fly Wizz Air again. The check in crew and the cabin crew were fantastic and I did witness how the check in crew in Athens were insulted and sworn at when all they were doing was their job. I also witnessed how some people blatantly lied to try and get what they wanted, such as the woman who had 3 cases but only paid for one and then refused to pay for the other 2 and blamed the very patient and polite man at the check in desk. Its amazing how people want to pay less but expect and demand more and then blame the staff for their incompetence. I fully understand how frustrating things can be when flying and especially when things go wrong, but in this instance Wizz Air excelled and in my opinion was a million times better than British Airways or Aegean. Leg room was adequate for me and I am 6.5" (1.98m).

### "worst airline I have ever seen"
Not Verified |  I was trying Wizz air first time and last time. The flight from Memmingen to Podgorica was over 1 hour delay with no excuse or explanation. The flight attendent are rude and having problems to show passenger the safety briefings in the cabin before takeoff. They have canceled my return flight 3 hours before scheduled return flight without any explanation or having a alternative flight back to Memmingen. The ground staff in Podgorica speaks no English and you have to be really lucky to find the Wizz air counter on that airport. The worst airline I have ever seen.

### "I will travel with them again"
Perfect trip for what I pay 120€. Aircraft clean and cabin crew was nice. I will travel with them again. No delay from Abu Dhabi to Santorini, delay for 1 hour on the return.

### "It is actually discrimination in my opinion"
Worst company ever, they charge us 80 EUR for printing our boarding pass, we did check in online but it didn't work. Not one of them could help, I called them, the 13 minutes cost 20 EUR, and I did not get any help. They said send an e-mail. When I sent it, I got the reply that they will answer within 30 days! No one at the airport from this company, zero help. Many people give you the worst reviews because of this stupid system. It is a scam, you do not think about people who travel with you for the first time, not about old people who can not manage this process, not about people who are not very digital. It is actually discrimination in my opinion.

### "Flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours"
Pretty terrible. Flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours, resulting in a midnight departure. They kept the lights on in the cabin so that no one could sleep and insisted on trying to sell people perfume at 2am in some crazed attempt to extract more money from a bunch of exhausted and annoyed passengers.

### "keep your money blocked"
Iasi to Luton. They scam you by rescheduling your flights. When you ask for the refund they keep your money blocked for 1 month and they lie to you that there was an error or they don t know why the money have not been given back. By the the time they give you the money back the flights prices are skyrocketing everywhere. So they used your money for 1 month (keep in mind that I am not the only one. There are loads of passengers like me) and then they get more money when you rebook alternatives if you rebook with them. Old scam done every year by this company, along with Blue Air and Tarom and who knows what other companies are using us like slaves.

### "15hr delay. No explanation"
Not Verified |  Do not use - worst experience. 15hr delay. No explanation, no apology, no hotel or shuttle arranged. The passengers spent the entire night on the cold floor after being bounced around for 4 hrs from idiot to idiot each with a different excuse.

### "never experienced such a bad experience"
No words could describe how bad, terrible, cheap and disgusting airline from the booking online all the way until you board! I been traveling for the past 22 years and never experienced such a bad experience to the point I spent all the time while queuing for boarding pass writing bad reviews in all platforms, even though I checked in online with no luggage I still had to queue for one hour.

### "do not use this company"
Not Verified |  Under any circumstances do not use this company. It would make Fawlty Towers Look like Emirates. I paid for extra leg room for myself and three other guest only to find the aircraft floor plan was wrong and the seats had been taken. The staff could not do much and helped as best they can. The refreshments were at best pathetic. I asked for and sandwich, we don't have any, crisps. None of that. What have you got. Whiskey, Wine. Tomato soup and cheese sandwiches. Not much of selection on a Half full flight. Absolutely Rubbish. Just read the other reviews and found only one positive one from someone who was moved because she was scared.

### "last time I will fly with this company"
Not Verified |  Worst company ever, I was book a flight in April for 28th June since they are open three flights a week from Malta to Belgrade on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, I planned everything for the flight on Tuesday from Malta and to return on Thursday back from Belgrade since I couldn't get more than two days on my work. They first change my flight time and move for a few hours before, and then for the day before departure and the day after arriving back in Malta so now I need to cancel or move all my schedule and they give me a big problem for everything and if I cancel no refund of my money, which is not my fault and I don't see why I need to pay for it because they are not even asked me before changing it or offer me refund or some other flight in the same day. This is last time I will fly with this company.

### "The first flight was delayed and re-delayed"
We are flying with Wizz Air twice within three days and were faced with the same problem: Uncountable reasons for delaying the flight. The first flight was delayed and re-delayed, we managed to board after two and a half hours and stayed inside the craft for another 75 minutes before taking off. We are actually waiting for the second flight to take place. We were notified for a delay (by giving an estimated departure time 2.5 hours later than the original departure time) although we were asked to be at the airport for the check in as scheduled originally. We were asked to sign a declaration that we have been notified for the rights by email and the company keeps on sending emails and sms with new delays and updates. Now they sent 4 euro coupon per person to be spent on some shops, which ridiculously cannot be used because this nominated shops are at different gate locations from the one we are supposed to take off.

### "Do not try to save money with this airline"
What a scam airline. Whilst the airline being aware of the delay at least 10h before (delay due to crew fatigue-totally preventable and foreseen), informed us just 2 hours before departure. Also there was absolutely nobody at the airport to help us or inform us what to do. ‘Got away’ with a measly 4€ coupon, me having lost my connection and offered no alternatives had to pay 105€ to get home with a 20hour delay. Nobody answered the call center. 1/10 never gonna fly again, that was totally intentional. Do not try to save money with this airline.

### "Atrocious attitude from staff"
Atrocious attitude from staff towards customers. I was on the morning 8:35 flight from Gatwick to Milan, being told twice the flight was delayed via text message with a final expected leaving time of 9:58. Gate announcement was delayed by 5 mins, every 5 mins a minute before gate announcement for half an hour straight. Boarding did not finish until 10:30. apologies and reason for delay was given by pilot as ‘its just been very busy’. Cabin crew have not offered any apology or compensation for this over two hour delay. We are currently sat on tarmac, still connected via airbridge at 11am. Passengers in front of me asked cabin crew if they knew when we would be leaving and got the reply ‘we are waiting till whenever, we leave when we leave’.

### "not recommend to anyone this airline"
I am frequent traveler but this Wizz Air flight was definitely my the worst one. We traveled from Vienna to Barcelona as a group of 5 people. Firstly we were not able to proceed with an online check in as there was only 2 seats available. What surprised us first at the airport was extremely arrogant staff. Secondly, we were asked to pay an additional 40Eur per person for check in at the airport, in spite of the mistake from the Wizz Air side. Lady at the check in counter rudely told us that we only have 2 options: Pay 40Eur per person or stay in Vienna. After paying 200Eur we came to check in counter and the lady informed us that only 3 people can fly, for the other 2 they didn't have seats as the flight was overbooked. Again rude with very bad attitude. She literally threw on us 2 boarding passes without seats mentioning that we can go and fight at the boarding counter. Boarding crew was nothing better but luckily (we don't know how) we got a seat. In spite of having Wizz Priority we had to wait until the last person boarded, not knowing if we were flying or not. Another disappointment was the very messy and dirty aircraft. I would not recommend to anyone this airline if you don't want your vacation to start (or maybe also end) with a disaster!

### "For low cost it is quite acceptable"
Not Verified |  The only problem i have with Wizz is frequent changes of flight times or dates. But they offer a refund or Wizz points for another flight so you can somehow manage the situation. So I would't recommend Wizz for business travel or any other travels where you don't have room for flexibility with time or dates. Regarding the flight itself, everything went smoothly, staff were pleasant and nice. For low cost it is quite acceptable.

### "best experience I ever had flying"
This was the best experience I ever had flying. I suffer of anxiety therefor my flights are horrible for me because I often have panic attacks. This time, I had the luck to encounter on board the best flight attendant I ever seen in all of my trips over the time. Her name is Madalina. She was there to comfort me. Right from the start she asked me to change sit so I was able to sit close to her. For the departure and landing she was talking to me and assuring me everything is going well. Like I said this was an amazing experience for me, such a dedication, love for her job and attention for her passengers I had not seen it before. She's so different than many other flight attendants and I hope more people will be like her.

### "forced me to pay 40 euros extra"
Not Verified |  Larnaca to Copenhagen. I couldn’t manage doing the check in online. Therefore, I go to the counter in the airport for standard check in. At the counter in Larnaca Airport there is another company named LGS Handling LTD and I speak with a lady who told me that I have to pay a fine of 40 euros in order to “unlock” my check-in and be able to take my flight as I was supposed to do it online instead. I explained to her my situation, that I couldn’t do the check-in online as there was this disservice on the Wizz Air website. I refused to pay and she called her supervisor/manager, who tried to convince me again that I had to pay. I refused again. Then he said he would contact Wizz Air to see if they could solve the problem (not sure he did it to be honest). LGS Handling forced me to pay 40 euros extra in order to take the flight I already paid for before.

### "3 times booking with them and not a single good experience"
Absolutely the worst airline ever. Avoid if you can. I can't imagine Ryanair to be named the worst airline when there's Wizz Air in the world! 3 times booking with them and not a single good experience (first two booking were made on the same day before I realized how absolutely horrible they were and the third one was made using the credit for my cancelled flight). Their customer service is non-existent and will never help you. Be careful, their online check in often doesn't work and you end up paying for airport check in! Just be kind to yourself and avoid this horrible airline!

### "cabin crew was friendly and helpful"
Not Verified |  All started pretty well: check in was fast and efficient although confusing for those who had booked priority, but then boarding was already chaotic because entry to the plane was made possible through front and rear entrance without advising pax which option to use - resulting in some clever people to get in at the back and then pushing themselves to the front, literally sitting in the 4th row! Then the fun started: we pushed away from the finger only to return after a long wait, getting told that due to a technical glitch some formalities had to be redone. After a lengthy conversation, we were asked if one of was willing to move to a seat on the other side of the plane to get the balance right, otherwise we won't be able to take off - one passenger makes a difference, really? Anyway, flight was uneventful only the fact that you can't move the seat back at all made it a bit uncomfortable, cabin crew was friendly and helpful and we arrived safely with two hours delay in Athens.

### "worst airline you can choose"
Worst airline I have ever used in my life. Flights are delayed or canceled in the last moment without justification, plane is small and dirty, on our flight, half of menu items were not available, staff is rude and unprofessional. On flight from Catania to Abu Dhabi, after boarding one person decided she doesn't want to fly and left the airplane. As a security procedure, staff shall check and verify each bag in the cabin. This was done only for half of the luggage even we requested the staff to do it for all. This is failed security protocol and was reported to authorities. All in all, worst airline you can choose. Avoid it at all cost.

### "The cancelled my ticket"
The cancelled my ticket less than 10 days before the actual flight and refused to offer the legal compensation. A disgrace. They claimed they have sent the cancellation earlier and as a proof they showed a comment from their system mentioning a hoax address, very different from the one I used for my booking.

### "No assistance whatsoever"
Went to the counter to check in. Informed us to get queue for security check. There’s 100 people in one queue and there’s 2 lines only for all the passengers in the airport in Tel Aviv with one man checking each line for security check. Letting people wait in one queue for 30 minutes then moving to another queue at the end of the line. No assistance whatsoever from the airline team. No responsibility and accountability in the ownership of organizing people. Twice we were informed we have to wait in the line with the same manager and blatantly lied about it. Informing us that we are wrong. Won’t refund the tickets because he isn’t part of the airline! But he’s there in the counter for Wizz Air checking in clients! Another long queue for departure gates with only 4 counters open. You need more than 4 hours to get in to your flight or they’ll just tell you that you can’t get in and buy another ticket! No empathy. Employees are rude.

### "all round terrible experience"
An all round terrible experience. Flight delayed by 3 hours, applied for compensation via the company website and it was declined as my flight landed ‘2 hours and 57 minutes’ after it was supposed to. Never received customer service this bad in my life, would really advise people to avoid Wizz Air as much as possible. Spend a few more pounds and fly with a decent airline.

### "worst company ever"
Not Verified | Sofia to Lisbon. This is the worst company ever! Ever. 1st their website crash every 5 minutes and you are not able to check in or buy ticked, and you have to wait for the website to restart. Also they send irrelevant messages to the customers regarding important documents. I have received an email this morning that I need to full fill locator form for Portugal and on their website said you don't need it. Then I had to call to support (mission impossible), but after 100 times I found the number and I called they assured me I don't need this form regarding the last regulations in the country. But this is not all. I bought a ticked in advance with priority mode and when I had to check in I got a random place. Then on the next day I have received more that ridiculous message from them: " Please note that the type of aircraft booked for your flight has been changed so that the seat (s) you originally selected is no longer available, and we are currently unable to allocate you space on the new aircraft. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Please arrive at the airport 3 hours before the departure time of your flight to receive a new allocated seat (if available). I had to call them and ask wtf this message means. The lady explain that even if I have ticket and pay extra for priority it is possible when I go to the airport to not have a place in the airplane. I am obligated to pay extra for place also, other wise I can not complain. Then I bought place for 10 euro, because the trip is important for me. This is my 2nd time using this company, I believe it is company, but whatever. I hope it will be the last one.

### "standards are not good enough"
The aircraft after 1 hour from the departure time was still on his bay, technical problem they said, safety comes first, but these issues should not arise at a time when the aircraft, fully booked is ready to take off. I believe that Wizz Air standards are not good enough and need to be reviewed.

### "Absolutely horrible"
Absolutely horrible. Extra charges which there was no previous information about (no email, nothing on booking, and couldn’t even find it on the website when I looked). Also, unsafe - announced that plane has an issue with brakes but they will be landing anyway!? People were praying on the plane - they should not let unsafe planes in the air. Never again.

### "lose hope that I will ever get refunded"
Wizz Air charged me for my flight, then canceled the flight in 2020 and never refunded the payment. When I am contacting Costumer Service I am getting the notification that my emails are not received as their inbox is full. Previously they were replying saying that the matter was still with Finance (for months). When calling, they are saying they can't find the booking in the system! I am starting to lose hope that I will ever get refunded. Extremely disappointed.

### "this is a lesson not to use cheap useless airlines"
They delayed the outgoing flight by one day - and the return flight by 3 days. This is obviously useless so I had to buy an Austrian Airlines ticket as well for some 550 euros. The website is useless, they do not answer the phone, so this is a lesson not to use cheap useless airlines.

### "charged 40 Euro per head to desk check-in"
Got charged 40 Euro per head to desk check-in, even though the website was unavailable. on the flight from Tirana to Madrid i made the check in on line and everything was ok. But from Madrid to Tirana i tried all day long all the day before but there was something wrong with the website. And paid 120 Euro for 3 persons with the hope that they will reimburse it to me.

### "The flight was good"
The flight was good. In all together the cabin crew was very nice, we arrived early and there was no delay in our trip. I found the seats a little bit uncomfortable, but thats acceptable for a low cost airline. The foods and drinks were a little too expensive.

### "Terrible experience with Wizz Air"
Terrible experience for the first flight with Wizz Air. It has been now the fourth time of delay, terrible, due to lack of cabin attendants. Never consider to fly with this airline again.

### "I am not getting any response"
In August 2021 my friend and I went to Budapest from Eindhoven NL. On the return date, we were denied to board the plane because it was overbooked. My friend received compensation for this, whereas mine got rejected. We submitted the exact same claim! I have submitted multiple complaints about this, but I am not getting any response. It seems like they are deliberately ignoring me so that I cannot use their final answer to start a procedure via the ECC.

### "it is not worth the stress"
Our outbound flight from Gatwick to Naples was delayed by nearly 3 hours because they oversold the tickets for the flight and then couldn't figure out which passengers should sit where. Then on our return flight, we arrived at the airport to find out our flight was going to be delayed again. Then we were sat nearby our departure gate for over an hour and the flight was never announced. Many other flights were announced but not Wizz Air. They also did not check for missing passengers and because of this we missed our flight. I will never fly with Wizz Air again and strongly recommend you do the same. Even if they are the cheapest, it is not worth the stress. I will happily pay much more to fly with a different airline.

### "Not recommend Wizz Air"
I needed to check in online two different Bookings. I used the WIZZ APP. By one of the bookings, it was ok. By the second booking, I went all through the check in and I had a problem with the Seats Payment. The WIZZ App didn't allow me to start again and pay for the seats. I even received an e-mail about the seats to pay. When I got at the Airport, they said that I didn't do the check in and I needed to pay 40 dollars for each person. I was very upset, because I did the check in in the APP, I just had problem with the Seats and the App could not retrieve my booking. They ask us to do check in online, the App did not work well and I paid the price. I wrote a complain to the WIZZ Air, but they didn't take serious. They said that it was my fault, that I did wrong. Not recommend Wizz Air. If they ask for Check in Online, they need to offer a good App.

### "Brilliant service for a low cost carrier"
Brilliant service for a low cost carrier. Clean and modern aircraft, good seating, the friendliest and most efficient crew I’ve experienced both from and to Gatwick. Bag drop off at Gatwick on the way out was slow but good on the way back from Funchal. Would definitely chose Wizz again.

### "the crew were amazing"
Not Verified |  I flew with Wizz Air yesterday (19/03/22) and the crew were amazing. I was feeling anxious about flying and the whole crew was so supportive and helped me a lot. They were making sure during the whole flight that I was feeling okay and checking up on me. Thank you all so much!

### "disgusted at how Wizz Air are operating"
Not Verified |  I am absolutely disgusted at how Wizz Air are operating and treating customers. Wizz Air have changed our flight 3 times and this final time we cannot make the flight time due to other commitments - but Wizz Air won’t allow us to book another flight without an extortionate fee and if we try to cancel the flight to get a refund they are charging us more than the flights actually cost. How is this reasonable or acceptable. Wizz Air charge your existing customer 1.50 a minute and the wait time is over 15 mins. The live chat bot is pointless and of no help. Wizz Air should be thoroughly ashamed of yourselves and your clear disregard for your customers. I will be raising a complaint and shouting about this from the rooftops.

### "The cabin crew did not nothing to police mask wearing"
Not Verified |  Believe the bad reviews. Boarding for the flight took place in a small room. Despite being in the middle of a global pandemic, few passengers and none of the gate staff wore masks. Passengers were advised they would have to put on masks on the plane. Then, at the point at which we should have boarded, the gate agent came back into the room and informed passengers (maskless of course and expelling aerosols over everyone) that the ground crew would not be able to load the plane and that any passengers with checked bags would not get them in Milan. These passengers could decide not to travel or follow up the missing bags later. We then boarded to be held on the ground for 2 hours while they attempted to resolve what transpired to me a wildcat strike by ground staff. The announcements from the cockpit were few and far between and refused to take any responsibility for the situation or suggest any attempts to mitigate it. The cabin crew did not nothing to police mask wearing among the passengers, with people sneezing and coughing all over the cabin while not wearing masks. Indeed, the crew were rather casual in mask wearing themselves, with the purser frequently pulling hers down. We eventually left and arrived two hours late. Upon arrival into Milan, we were all piled into a crowded bus, again with no checking of mask wearing. Admittedly, the crew did offer free water and a small snack to apologize for the delay. But the whole situation was handled really badly. Given the clear lack of respect for our safety I will definitely avoid this airline in future.

### "avoiding this scam company from now on"
Not Verified |  Had a flight that was cancelled for no apparent reason, and no justification was given. I was refunded, but only partial, when it should have been a full refund. Tried to contact them but all agents are always busy, and over the phone is super expensive, so I am not going to give them a call. Totally avoiding this scam company from now on.

### "never use a company like this again"
As it was for a couple of days I took just hand luggage, no problem leaving Luton but coming back from Venice the booking area insisted it was too large for hand luggage and should go into the hold. Not a nice person so insisted a fee of 32 euros was paid. I have never flown budget airlines and I will never use a company like this again. I never booked this trip so could not believe how bad they are. A Hungarian company, making money by illegal ways.

### "crew were friendly and attentive"
Not Verified |  Paid £17.99 for a flight to Greece. Saw all of the horrible reviews and expected the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised. The flight departed on time, cabin was clean, crew were friendly and attentive. Seats weren’t the most comfortable, and I think anything more than 3 hours might be quite painful. Crew not pushy with inflight sales like on Ryanair which was nice to see. Would fly again, maybe I got lucky, but nothing wrong with my experience with Wizz.

### "This company is a disgrace"
Not Verified |  I booked a holiday to the Ukraine as part of a package through a tour operator, this included flights with Wizz Air. Four days before we were due to fly out, the tour operator cancelled the holiday due to the current situation and the country not being safe. At the time we were due to fly the UK Government had advised against non-essential travel to the Ukraine and that all UK nationals, including members of the Embassy were advised to return to the UK. I spoke to Wizz Air regarding a refund for my seats and baggage which I paid for directly with them (as I had already checked into my flight), but they ignorantly replied saying it was my choice not to board the flight, so tough, no refund. This is a loss of over £100 to myself due to their total lack of understand of the current situation. There was no remorse for the people suffering in the Ukraine right now, no lack of understanding as to why the tour operator cancelled my holiday, just a straight "no", you cannot have my money back. It is absolutely outrageous that Wizz Air has taken the stance not to provide me with this refund. And clearly shows their utter lack of concern for the current situation which is happening in the Ukraine. This company is a disgrace.

### "not very strict with the covid mask wearing"
Very good for low cost airline, the aircraft was spotless and seat pitch was adequate. Seats do not recline and there are no screens to see the flight path. Everything has to be paid for food and beverage. Relaxed for the bags that you are carrying. Staff was friendly but they were not very strict with the covid mask wearing. Flights were on time.

### "they charged me two additional charges"
I booked the flight via a 3rd party website and then attempted to log in. I tried on the 3rd party website, Wizz air website and Wizz air app. It would not let me, and requested I go to the desk upon arrival. When I arrived they stated that 3rd parties are responsible for sharing check in details, and if I book anywhere other than the Wizz air website that I will always have to check in at the airport on the day. This meant they charged me two additional charges equating to 72 GBP for the service of checking me in and printing my ticket which equated to the cost of the flight! This happened to multiple people before and after me. I have since raised this with the 3rd party and correct authorities and it is indeed malpractice used to cut out comparison sites and extract money from consumers by concealing costs and entrapping them into paying it or missing the flight (pressure tactics).

### "No safety guidance at all"
Not Verified | Just boarded Wizz Air (first ever flight with them) for a flight to Tenerife and what a shambles! It was like playing musical chairs. The crew let everybody and anybody move seats to wherever they wanted. No safety guidance at all. Correct me if I'm wrong but I always thought that you needed to be in your allocated seat for take off and landing. At least 30 people swapped seats/places, delayed the flight slightly whilst they decided where they wanted to sit. Bloody ridiculous. Crew seem nice but have absolutely no control

### "Overall good value for money"
Totally acceptable for the price paid. No problems with booking, buying services and checking in online. At the airport check in needed more punctual start (delayed by 30 min). Boarding process was organised ok. Onboard no dislikes. Seat pitch and legroom better than before. Plane in perfect condition. Toilets tidy. Disembarkation well ordered. No problem with overhead bags placement. Bought a bottle of water onboard. Paid with card, no problem. Overall good value for money. Recommended.

### "a very unreliable company"
Not Verified |  I had to pay extra 40 euro at airport for check in. I tried to check in online in advance for free as their site promises that it works, but I couldn't finish my check in because free seats were finished. I wanted to buy a seat for to finish the check in, but even then I couldn't finish the check in because of some technical errors of their site. In reality this is how they work, they block you for finishing the online check in for free for to take more money from you at airport. Many other passengers from that flight had the same problem. I don't recommend Wizz Air, they attract people with cheap prices, but in reality you pay for all kind of fees and unexpected errors they create. It's better to buy from a honest company who tells you straight how much it costs without scamming you and deceived you. Reading other people's reviews I see that Wizz Air is a very unreliable company. Some people have much more terrible experience with them.

### "overall quality of this business is abysmal"
Not Verified | Booked through an Agent to go to Iceland, outbound flight only from London. One day after booking they changed the flight by 2 days. Originally, it was Thursday 17:50 and it was changed to Saturday 05:50. Ridiculous change. Considering it was a meant to be a long weekend (Thurs-Mon) this was a totally unacceptable change. I tried to contact them. Their online Agent service was perpetually busy so couldn't get though. I went to call and notice they have allocated call centres per country which charge rather extortionate rates so wasn't willing to call them. Found a local number which I called and I was transferred to an extremely rude, snappy and impatient agent. She informed me that I needed to obtain the email address and phone number of the travel agent in order to proceed with any refund. I provided what information Google had which wasn't satisfactory to them. They suggested I contact them to find this out. Again, absoultey ridiculous considering they changed my flight. I eventually call back after contacting Trip directly, who were unable to provide this information. Again I was transferred to an extremely rude agent who again didn't provide any sort of refund or alternative solution. I hung up frustrated and managed to resolve the issue with my booking agent, who will make the refund request themselves. Extremely budget airline with no operational management skills, with obvious contempt and disregard for the customer. Likely all manner of profits go into the pockets of their investors and shareholders as the overall quality of this business is abysmal.

### "I couldn't book the tickets"
Not Verified |  I couldn't even fly with Wizz Air because I couldn't book the tickets. They started off at £60pp. Having tried 4 times with 3 different booking services, I gave up and booked a train. Lastminute.com tried to book it twice, took payment then said they couldn't and are sending a refund. MyTrip tried to get the payment to go through twice, couldn't. The price was supposed to be £60pp. By the time I gave up, it had gone up to over £90pp. Each time, I got part of the way through booking before being informed that the price had gone up. I'm taking the train instead. It costs a bit more but at least I know I can actually get back from France. Hearing the horror stories of people who actually got their booking to go through, I'm glad it failed.

### "What a terrible flight experience"
Not Verified |  What a terrible flight experience. Check-in issues occurred online, due to "website technical difficulties", forcing passengers to do it on-site. Moreover, this company is surprisingly waiting for the very last second before letting the passengers get on board, in a totally rushed and disorganized manner. Unbelievable. To make things even worse, there was absolutely no guidance from any crew member resulting in passengers getting stuck for several minutes standing in the plane's main way not knowing where to put their luggage, in Covid19 times. Unreal. Better pay 10% more and get a decently organized crew team. Or go to another low-cost company. Is it needed to mention, the flight is way late on schedule. Never again.

### "Worst airline I’ve ever flown"
Not Verified | Worst airline I’ve ever flown. Going out to Lanzarote the flight was delayed. The seats were awful and uncomfortable, it felt like they strapped a bit of plastic over a metal seat, never have I seen a seat with seams which run down both length of your legs which after a 4 hour flight just made indents into the backs of your legs, just to make it that more bit uncomfortable. Flight delayed both ways. On return they ran out of all food apart from Pringles. When asked they said it was because the previous flight ate all the food? (I thought the delay was because they were restocking?! No. Empty. Never flying with wizz air again.

### 2great experience flying with Wizz Air"
I had a great experience flying with Wizz Air. On both flights, we departed on time - even arrived 10mn before schedule on our return flight to London. The cabin crew was really pleasant - one of the flight attendants gave a free chocolate bar to my toddler when we flew out on Christmas eve. And the planes were recent, in good condition and the pilots made us feel safe (I'm a nervous flyer). Overall very smooth and pleasant experience. Of course it is not all perfect. The online check in will make you lose the will to live. .. all I can say is keep trying (a tip if you register multiple people with the same booking reference is to use a new browser each time). Alternatively try with the app. And yes the baggage allowance is minimal and you have to pay (a lot) for extra bags but that is the same with every low cost companies.

### "poor quality and unreliable"
I don’t write reviews often but Wizz air flights are mostly late at least in my experience flying from Vilnius to UK. Today it means I will miss my booked PCR test appointment and other arrangements which will make me non compliant with regulations or not able to go to work, given that such delay is occurring very often. I think  this airline has to be highlighted as poor quality and unreliable so customers could make informed choices when possible and fly alternative choices to more reliable airlines

### "never fly with Wizz Air ever again"
Not Verified | I understand that they have to make money in other ways since some flights are cheap, but that's just ridiculous. Before my flight, I had to make the check-in online for my father. At the point where you have to put some contact information, like email and phone number. Every email we put didn't work, saying that he email is already on another passenger, which is impossible since my father was travelling alone. After a few minutes, we read that this information was not mandatory, but we could not go further. After a while, we saw that, somehow, my father's 2nd name wasn't displaying. We tried to change it. BAM €92 for the change even though the first time was free, as it was written on top. After that we tried to call the customer service, which is €1.22/min and since everyone, these days, is using unlimited calls and data, we could not call anyone. They have no email either. To close it up, my father has to wait till the departure day and do the check-in at the airport, paying, again, €11. Will never fly with Wizz Air ever again.

### "all in all a really bad experience"
From the start when entering the airport, there was a massive queue even though we purchased priority and my wife was pregnant, we were in the same queue as there was nothing organised on the floor and checking desk staff did not even care. The queue reached the entrance of the airport and still no one was doing anything about it. Going through the border was a total chaos, no proper signs, no social distancing at the time and they put us all in one very small room which pushed people to be nervous and kids crying and air con was not working at all so everyone was sweating. When the gate was open, they did not even make the same announcement in English so everyone rushed like crazy not knowing who had priority and elderly and families were struggling...the whole situation make my wife faint and sick throwing up and guess what it happened next to a Wizz Air agent who did not even bother to check on her or call for help or even ask people to make some space for her to breathe. We reached our destination and then we waited over an hour to collect our luggage, we complained to them, they said that their staff in Belgrade are subcontractors. That made me sick to the core to read that...all in all a really bad experience and we will not be using them again.

### "They are cheap but they use people to pay extra"
They are cheap but they use people to pay extra. I didn't make the check in online because I thought it's covid and you need to make the check in at the airport and in anyway I needed to leave my bag at the check-in. They tell me that I need to pay 40 euro for checking per person so I had to pay 80 euro only for check-in. I was asking why you make me pay like this, the employee was so rude telling me with a loud voice either you pay or you go back to your home - so rude.

### "Awful customer service"
Awful customer service. Awful communication and lots of hidden costs. For my return flight from Warsaw to Paris, WizzAir app wouldn't allow me to complete online check-in the day before, nor the same day, hours before the flight. I thought it was something related to Covid regulations, so I went to the airport as early as possible, and I had to pay 35 euros to do a check-in at the airport. That is, after I paid already for priority boarding at 42 euros, on top of my ticket price. Then upon emailing their customer service about the situation, with photos of receipts and boarding pass, they denied me a reimbursement, citing it was my responsibility to do the check-in before, whereas it was theirs to provide me access to the check-in. Also, their aircrafts are very uncomfortable, noisy, and they feel unsafe. And their flight attendants tend to be a little rough and prosaic. They have lost my clientèle for ever, and I will change destinations if I have to, just to not fly with them ever again.

### "They don’t care, they say pay or don’t travel"
Not Verified |  Wizz Air is a cheap airline and like all cheap airlines they seem to pile on the money by charging for your seat after you have purchased a ticket. So the fee you see is just to get you through the door - any bag larger than a shoe box you pay for - check in at the airport £35 per person. Seats - The price you see is for a ticket. I am yet to find a way to book without being charged £20 on top for a seat. Regardless of whether I choose the seats or allow them to. If there is a way, it’s hidden or not obvious. Inflight - Usual small selection of expensive snacks - anything goes wrong expect to be quoted terms and conditions stating they can’t help and you should have known this. Refunds - if you actually manage to get one it is to a Wizz Air account to use with Wizz Air. So not actually a refund at all. It cost me €70+ euros for checking in 2 people at the airport which I was forced to do as their app is unreliable. It always seems to crash when trying to use it to check in so you need to check in from a computer. I was one of many dozen at the airport on both recent occasions when I travelled with the same issue and same huge additional bill to pay before we could travel. They don’t care, they say pay or don’t travel and lose all the money as our refund policy prevents you refunding under such circumstances unless you bay x 10 for a flexible refundable ticket. And then they only will refund to our Wizz Air account, which I am pretty sure is something you cannot enforce in the UK.

### "Customer service is really bad"
Their app is sophisticated and tricky. I had to change flight and did not see that they automatically changed my departure date. Long story short I had to reschedule flight and their "changing fee" was basically buying a new flight. Customer service is really bad.

### "The worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever. They charged for check 36 pounds in the airport although it was not possible to do it via internet. You have to wait hours in the queue to take your passport card either you have done check in via internet or not. I chose a flight at noon which was more expensive but out of the blue they changed it and put it at 7.00 am. I booked it for cheaper but lastly it costed a lot lot more. Do not book with it.

### "$150 dollars just to do a regular check in"
There is a new model of airline that desperately wants to undercut the prices of other airlines to get your business, and that is Wizz Air. They present a low priced ticket to snipe your attention and your money, then once you’ve committed your purchase, they add on all of the extras. Do you  want to sit with your young child? They’ll charge you for that. Do you want to carry a bag with you larger than a computer case? They’ll charge you for that. Did you want to check in for your flight somehow? They’ll charge you for that (they even charge for online check in). You get a cheap price up front until they secure your business, but once they have it, the stack on the extra fees until your ticket price becomes comparable to an actual reputable airline. You will not be able to fly without paying extra fees. Because I didn’t check in online the day before (because you know, I have things to do before I go on vacation) they charged me an extra $150 dollars just to do a regular check in. Then, because I had a cabin-sized bag and a camera bag, they charged me an extra $25 for that. Then because I didn’t pay for assigned seats they actually sat my four year old child away from us. They had it on record that he was four years old and their seating arrangement came up with that! Can you believe it? Sure we could switch it around so he wasn’t unaccompanied, but they were perfectly fine with separating the child from his family because a fee wasn’t paid. That’s a pretty gross business practice and I almost wonder if it was intentional because a fee wasn’t paid. For real. This becomes a moral and ethical issue when they will make a child sit alone unless you pay an extra fee for seating. It’s actually a disgusting business model and I will never fly this deceptive airline again. Just pay the extra money for a more reputable airline instead of this sneaky nonsense that Wizz Air pulls on its clients. So what is Wizz Air prioritizing? Cheap shot fees over customer service and satisfaction. DO NOT book this airline because it looks like a deal. It is not a good deal. They will loot you in one way or another by the time you get on that plane, and if you don’t pay the extra fees, they’ll show you why you better pay them in advance next time. Go with a more reputable airline that doesn’t hide fees and carry on such underhanded business. Somewhere a board of directors is congratulating itself for this business model. So much for ethics and customer service. Cleary a thing of the past.

### "treated the situation really badly"
Travelling on the 28th October to Thessaloniki from Larnaca with Wizz Air. The actual flight was scheduled to depart at 11.00am. They delayed the flight for 30 min 2-3 days before the flight. After every single passenger was boarded the pilot announced us that because in Thessaloniki it is a celebration due to the 28th of October National day, the airport will be closed for 2 hours so the new departure time would be in 55 minutes. While all passengers are seated like sardines in a fully booked flight. Didn't they know its a national holiday? Why didn't they postpone the flight for 2 hours 3-4 days before the flight so they don't torture their customers? Because before being passengers we are customers. And if you create feelings of dissatisfaction we will not fly with you again. Guys you treated the situation really badly and unprofessional.

### "no info about any delays"
Luton to Rome. There was no info about any delays. People asked to proceed to the gate 11. Everyone went to the gate and people had to wait there for 1 hour! Because apparently there was a delay. Only 1 person was checking tickets from all passengers! Gate 11 area is like a stable rather than airport. No seats, no toilets. Everyone could have waited in a lounge rather than being crowded in a small area during covid pandemic.

### " Such a lack of professionalism"
Not Verified |  I flew from Iasi to Luton. The stewardesses are generally unprofessional. They spoke loud all the fly and laughing considerably witch doesn't look very professional. When they needed to speak they even couldn't finish their script and start laughing. At the end of the flight one of the other passengers become aggressive. One of the stewardesses instead of staying calm and managing the situation started to scream and threatening us that no one will leave the air plane until police will come. She started screaming to other passengers to manage the lady themselves is like was the other passengers job not their job. One of the stewardesses was also nearly crying. Now I am wondering myself if they react like that were there wasn't any imminent danger how they react in a real emergency situations. Their behaviour was like someone was taken from the street without any training and placed to do a stewardess job. Such a lack of professionalism never seen in my life. Very disappointed.

### "I was positively surprised"
We left on time from Oslo Torp. We had priority pass with a cabin bag so we went straight through to the security check and passport check. The plane seemed clean, and the flight attendants where good. As with all these low cost airlines you should read up before traveling so you wont be charged extra for something. On the way back the crew at the gate seemed not so professional. They started to board non priority passengers before the priority ones. The flight back was also on time, and with nice flight attendants. I had booked extra leg space both ways because of my hight, 193 cm. After reading a lot of bad reviews of this airline I was positively surprised

### "Tickets are cheap and cheap is what you get"
Worst airline ever! Tickets are cheap and cheap is what you get, but they charge you extra for literally everything. If you don't pay extra they will sit you apart even if there were enough seats to easily let groups sit together and so on, never choose Wizz Air if there is an alternative.

### "delay due to boarding disorganization"
The crew of this company has no clue whatsoever of how the boarding process should work. There is a surcharge for the passengers that pay for priority boarding, 2 lines: one for priority one for economy, most of the passengers don’t know the difference and the crew will not bother (not even once) to announce who should line up on the right or left. I traveled with this company twice and both times between 1 and 2 hours of delay. On my last flight I complained to a crew member and he blamed me for not asking people if they were in the correct line, I thought it was their job to make sure boarding process goes smooth, organized and respects the customers who paid extra money to board first. What’s sad is that both times the captain of the flight apologized for the delay due to boarding disorganization, yet nothing changes. They take forever, do not travel with them if you have a meeting to attend or a connection to catch, 99% sure you will miss it.

### "Check-in with Wizz Air is only Online"
Absolutely scammers It seems to me that this company still make a big business with the Check-in with their customers, like the old times. We arrived to the Tirana airport like 3 hours before our flight, just to avoid any problem on the counter and have a pleasant flight, well, we were totally wrong. Result that the Check-in with Wizz Air is only Online, and it closes 3 hours before the flight. They didn’t even send us a email telling us this situation. We ended up paying 40 euros each one for the check-in, a total of 80 Euros.

### "everyone who I interacted with was rude, and completely uninterested in helping me"
I had an extremely negative experience with Wizz Air yesterday while attempting to fly to Reykjavik. First, I received my boarding pass on my phone prior to arrival at the airport and didn't need to check any baggage, so I went straight through security and into the airport. Budapest airport doesn't announce the gate for your flight until about 30 minutes prior to check-in closing, so I waited around for a while. Finally, my gate information appears and I went straight to my gate to check in (almost the first one in line). Right away, I am asked for my covid documentation which I have in the form of the EU Digital CovidPass, which is accepted in Iceland and is what I obtained especially for this trip (I'm am American citizen and was fully vaccinated in America, which makes this a lengthy process). The girl at check in says that it is not sufficient and I will also need a negative covid test to travel. First of all! I checked the travel restrictions for Iceland several times prior to my journey and read in numerous places that a test was not necessary. Can you visit Iceland? Yes. All travelers – regardless of origin – are welcome to visit Iceland if they can show either a certificate of full vaccination against COVID, or a certificate of previous COVID infection. - Icelandair I assume, therefore, that with my EU residence permit and EU Digital CovidPass, that I would be OK for travel. Second of all, neither that service that I booked through (Kiwi) or my airline (Wizz) provided any information about what documents I would need until the second I arrived at the gate, only 30 minutes before the closing of check-in. Finally, almost everyone who I interacted with was rude, and completely uninterested in helping me find a solution. I could have received a rapid test at Budapest airport in time, or there is a perfectly valid option to receive a test in Iceland and quarantine until the results return. No matter the suggestion I made, the Wizz Air authorities were disrespectful and adamant that I do not board the plane. And I believe its also relevant to add that I'm a 19 year old solo female traveler, for which the thought of missing my flight and being stranded in a foreign country is not particularly pleasant, however I was met with no sympathy from anyone during this experience. Extremely dissatisfied with Wizz customer service and refund policy. Do better.

### "No refund and no credit note"
Problem right from the minute i booked the tickets with the non user friendly website. Complicated I believe on purpose. In order to make booking changes, the site prompts you to make o phone call, selecting country and language, charging you at a very expensive rate ending up to an operator speaking only English. Finally the choice given to change the dates of traveling was costing more than the original coast of the ticket. No refund and no credit note. The reservation has been done and paid by me, on behalf of my relatives leaving in Greece. They didn't travel due to Covid -19 restrictions set by the Greek government during that period due to the fact that they are Health Civil Servants.

### "their service is blatantly awful"
Do not fly with Wizz Air. Their work ethic is non-existent, they do not care at all about customers and their service is blatantly awful. Each time I have flown with this airline the flights have been delayed multiple times (up to 6 hours per flight), the last time being today. They first delay it by 20 mins then by 40 mins then by 1 hour and so on. They just told us “they cannot tell us at which time the flight will board/take off”, unbelievable! I have only booked this ticket as Wizz Air is the only company which offers the connection between the two airports which are most convenient for my needs, but I will definitely by flying to another airport just to avoid them.

### "Stay away from this joke company"
2.5 hours delay. Staff at BUD had no idea whats going on. 1.5 hours earlier check in everybody at the desk, than half an hour later send us out, as another flight was supposed to start from the same gate, than check in everybody again for the 2nd time. After this giving vouchers to the passengers which are only valid on the day of flight, and in restaurants in the main lobby area so they were useless. I purchased priority boarding for no reason. They let everybody on board without any rules or plans. Staff on board very unfriendly! After all this misery we have got a can of coke and a piece of chocolate. Never ever again. Rather driving 10 hours with car or paying double for Swiss Air. Stay away from this joke company.

### "flight attendant was not really friendly"
The flight attendant on Wizz Air flight from Nuremberg to Skopje was not really friendly. After the flight was boarded we kindly asked a male flight attendant if it is possible that we sit at the emergency exit seats for more leg room. To which we received no answer but an ignoring look. And the seats remained empty for the whole flight.

### "A terrible experience"
A terrible experience masquerading as good value. If you don't check-in online 3 hours prior to boarding you are required to pay a fee (40€ per person in our case) for the privilege of checking-in in person at the airport. But there's more! They were not able to accept payment at the check-in counter, so we had to find a hidden counter at the end of the airport (not even labeled with Wizz Air) in order to pay. The payment system was painfully slow, taking up to 10 minutes per person since they had to document the payment through handwriting. This process took an hour to go through about five groups. No exaggerating. Then our flight didn't even start boarding on time, as the flight before us from Wizz Air was exceptionally delayed due to a large number of passengers needing to do the same process of paying to be able to check-in. That said, I am unsure I can rule out organizational incompetence as well. Now onto regular airline things: seats did not recline and no complimentary beverages or snack.

### "problem right from the minute i booked my ticket"
I flew with Wizz Air on 20/08/21 and I had problem right from the minute i booked my ticket, after approval of my purchased ticket I received notice that I have underpaid my ticket by £24 I then called the call centre twice - the first time I was on hold for 50 minutes and nobody answered, second time 1 hour and still nobody answered. Finally I managed to pay the outstanding £24 ,a few days later I wanted to download my boarding ticket i then received info that I couldn’t download my boarding pass because I was over £12 then realised I was charged £12 for spoilage fees due to my original purchase being underpaid without my knowing. The day of my flight I was still unable to check in which meant I had to arrive at the airport 5 hours before my flight, finally managed to check in after 2 hours because staff didn’t know how to help I got sent to 5 different staff members. I had the exact same problem flying back.

### "incredible difficulties checking in online"
Not Verified |  This review is not about the flight itself but the website and customer service. The website is the worst thing I have seen probably. We had incredible difficulties checking in online and ended up paying a large fee at the airport. On our way back we tried online book in - it was not possible. There is a service hotline that charges incredible fees and a hidden service hotline that doesn´t charge. Calling the later a man with a very heavy accent answered. I had to tell him my booking number, which I did. It started with GG****. Upon spelling it I was informed that there is no letter G in the English alphabet. We agreed that actually there was a letter G. After a very treadful conversation absolutely nothing got done - I'm still not checked in. I fully expect to be charged another 50€ for not being able to check in beforehand, which as I said was literally impossible. I will never book this airline again.

### "pro charging customer everything"
The flight itself is ok but the customer service and non working check in which later cost you 75€ is the worst. This is pro charging customer everything company rather than pro customer. We as passengers must stop using those cheap airlines as the cost of it is a regular airline but it is just hidden in luggage and extra charges. If I would be the ceo of such company this days - I would be ashamed.

### "never fly with Wizz Air again"
I had flight from Palma de Mallorca to Larnaca with transfer in Budapest. Wizz air changed the time of the flight from Palma to Budapest with few hours, so I was gonna lose the flight from Budapest to Larnaca. I tried to contact them, but no answer on the phone, no email of them, so I called to the airport of Larnaca and they told me that the only option I have is to change my flight from Budapest to Larnaca with 12 hours, for the next day and pay the fee 35 euro. So I had to stay all night on the airport and wait for my flight. I had important meeting in the morning in larnaca, so I couldn't wait for it. I decided to buy another ticket, of course with another company. Well Wizz air didnt refund me money, couldn't change the date of the ticket for free, even though was theirs fault and I paid more money for my new ticket. I will never fly with Wizz Air again, the worst company ever. There is no way you can contact them every change u want to make on your ticket u have to pay 35 euro, even if u want to cancel it. This cheap ticket with wizz air became so expensive.

### "unprofessional and chaotic service"
Not Verified |  This is the last time in my life when i fly with them. The most unprofessional and chaotic service. We wanted to secure our luggage with plastic, we were told that is closed, without any other explanation. Next, at the check in, they were trying everything to accuse you of something and make you pay extra (for example, the change of the surname is 120euros). Last, but least, when we made the security check, they treated us like objects of some kind, they didn't even allow the time to recover our things.

### "The worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. Endless queues with no distance at all. Staff unprepared and kept asking us to move from queue to queue. I was with 2 special needs children with the sunflower collar and asked for help with the checking and they refused. We were waiting for almost 2 hours at the checking point and they signed our boarding pass at 5.20 am and closed the gate at 5.39am. They did not inform the aircraft that we were a group of family 10 people the last ones doing the checking to that place and we needed to pass through the security to them arrive to the gate. They closed the gate without us and denied us. We were unable to fly. My kids were in emotional distress and we arrived at the airport at 4am and joined the queue which was for 8 different countries at the same time.

### "cancelled time and time again"
Not Verified |  My Wizz air experience starts 1 year ago. Booked flights to Alicante which due to covid have been cancelled time and time again. Additionally my Next two flights 26 Aug & 23 Sep both significantly changed and I mean by days. They bring me home 2 days early and despite me trying to get them to bring me back 2 sept instead 29 Aug. ( I had booked 31 Aug originally) they won’t budge. On top this the money I paid for Wizz discount annual Membership has expired and despite I’ve never managed to fly with them will they agree to extend it for another year or refund it?

### "they will never refund this money and aren’t bothered"
Not Verified | I booked a flight for 6 people with Wizz Air which was cancelled within 2 days more than a month ago and still no refund. Wizz Air were still selling tickets days later for this flight. Having called them at least 20 times they have a terrible attitude and either hang up after being on hold for half an hour or lie and initially said refund would be 1 week, when calling back this has turned to 3 weeks and when no refund still they say I needed to complain to the airline. Now I am going to the Financial Ombudsman and through Credit Card protection as they will never refund this money and aren’t bothered.

### "consider other airline options"
Not Verified |  We had a flight as a family with two little kids. I bought four tickets via a leading online agent and received a confirmation from this agent, which has misleading information about online check-in. We did not receive any confirmation/information email directly from Wizz Air. I tried to complete online check-in a day before the flight date. I couldn’t do online check-in using laptop; because it was saying that I had to print the boarding passes if I use a computer browser, however I didn’t have any chance to access printing facilities as I was in a different country. Then I tried to do is by downloading the app. The app allowed me to choose a seat for the first passenger; however it didn’t let me choose a seat for the second passenger. Therefore I couldn’t proceed and couldn’t do the mobile check-in. The next day when we arrived at the airport, they send us to another office in the airport to do the check-in. That was where we were shocked as they charge 40 Euros per passenger, 160 Euros in total to complete the check in and give us the boarding cards. We reached home somehow, but I would definitely advise to consider other airline options if you can find before deciding on Wizz Air.

### "charged me extra my for my hand luggage"
For my inbound flight, the website did not allow me to do the online check-in. I tried several times, without success. Therefore I had to pay the airport check-in, and they refused to give me a refund. I always make sure I do it online, and on time. I did so for the outbound flight, so I knew how to do it, but their website wasn't working properly, and they simply charged me, not taking any responsibility. I will never fly with them again, and I seriously advise everyone against doing so. You never know if you'll end up paying a very expensive ticket all in all, for nothing. They changed my first flight, which means I had to change my plans in order to catch the plane (earlier than it originally was). The boarding took forever, the flight was late. They charged me extra my for my hand luggage too in my inbound flight. No one had said anything in the outbound one. Not recommended.

### "It is not the first delay of this company"
It is not the first delay of this company. We arrived in Chania one week ago from Sofia with 1 hour of delay. Now we are waiting almost 3 hours, the planned departure time was 19.40 pm. The airplane departed from Sofia at 19.55, so our delay will be 3 hours, it will arrive to Chania about 9.30 pm, so maybe we could depart from here to Sofia about 10 pm. It is not normal at all in these pandemic conditions to stay more than 3 hours in a likely contaminated environment and wearing masks for so many hours. It is a threat for health. And in the past years I can remember more bad experiences with the same Wizz Air company. The facts are without any exaggeration.

### "Complete chaos during check-in"
Complete chaos during check-in in Vienna. Not enough ground staff and non-existent management of queues and crowd resulted in one hour plus wait for the baggage drop. In addition, once it was our turn we were told to move "quick, quick". Furthermore, apparently to save costs Wizz Air doesn't use enough busses to bring passengers from the gate to the plane so that we were all cramped in one bus, while during check-in and boarding being constantly reminded to maintain one metre distance due to covid. Flight crew was friendly therefore 2 stars for an overall bad and stressful experience.

### "customer services are beyond useless"
‪The worst airline I have ever had the bad fortune to deal with. They cancelled the flight, I spoke to customer services who are beyond useless and my refund promised to me in March that was going to take 7 days has still not been received and I hope other passengers take my warning and never fly Wizz. ‬They pretend they have refunded your money, ask YOU for bank confirmations, YOU have not received it yet, it was never transferred. Heed my warning and don’t fly Wizz.

### "I am very unsatisfied with this airline"
I am very unsatisfied with this airline. I just have a flight from Basel to Tirana and all you can see inside the plane is pollution and no clean service. I also asked the steward at she said to me that we didn't have time to clean. I am very unhappy, you will find the photos attached.

### "Last time to fly with this company"
I booked for Wizz Air. The aircraft is from Getjet Airlines and we are not allowed to put our bags in the upper space. They forced me to put my bag under the seat in front of me. Just because I did not have a priority booking ticket. Couldn’t do anything about it as the flight was operated by another company (Getjet). The staff was really rude and acted with the people without a priority booking as they were homeless people. Last time to fly with this company!

### "Most of the plane missed the flight on no fault of their own"
Not Verified |  The worst airline in the whole world. Last week I was booked on a flight, we arrived at the airport three plus hours before the flight that was to take place at 6am. Four thirty the check in personnel showed up and started nitpicking everyone over two hundred grams overweight on luggage and other such things. After a mad rush to the gate we and about one hundred other travelers out of about one hundred and eighty plus passengers were told that we are too late! Families with crying children! Most of the plane missed the flight on no fault of their own. The airline takes no responsibility at all for their passengers and left everyone stranded there.

### "Bad customer experience"
Wizz air is not serious. This is the first time I fly with them from Basel to Budapest round trip. Basel-Budapest was delayed twice a few hours before departure, first for 1 hour and then for 40 minutes. Bad customer experience. For Budapest - Basel the flight got delayed 30 minutes. Seems like delaying flights is a usual event with Wizz air. Will make sure I never fly with them again.

### "Never again Wizz Air for me"
Wizz Air changed both my destination and return trip a couple of weeks before my flight and I could not change my vacation plans. I arrived very late and had to pay a night in an hotel before renting a car the next day. They sent me on a return flight incredibly early in the morning. Never again Wizz Air for me.

### "I would not recommend Wizz Air"
I would not recommend Wizz Air, if you have any other possibility take an other airline!!! There is no service at all. You have to pay even for your cabin baggage. When i tried to do online check in unfortunately the web side was showing an error and i had to pay extra on the airport, because they checked me in there. At the end i payed more for a charter flight then to a normal airline.

### "not be flying Wizz Air again"
I had a direct flight from Vienna to Podgorica, with two checked bags, for which I paid extra $$. I got to Podgorica, and waited an hour for my bags to appear, just to find out that they had not arrived. The woman at the lost bags desk was incredibly rude and dismissive, showing no concern for the fact that my bags had not arrived from Vienna. I learned only that my bags were still at the Vienna airport, that is, that WizzAir had forgotten/neglected to bring them on board, and after leaving my information at the desk, I was told to call back the following day. I was also told that because I would be staying in Albania, the airline is unable to deliver my bags to me, and I would hve to make another trip to the airport in Podgorica once they arrive. I have essential medications, all of my clothes, and various necessities for travel and daily life. Upon calling back the next day, I was informed once again by a cold, unconcerned service agent that my bags would not arrive until Saturday (5 days post-flight), at an unknown time. I will not be flying Wizz Air again and do not recommend it to anyone.

### "Wizz Air made me miss my flight"
Wizz Air made me miss my flight. I bought a ticket from Luton to Gibraltar for July 5th 2021. When I arrived at the check-in, their staff told me that I needed a COVID test before arrival in Gibraltar. I questioned this as I understood that testing was only required on arrival. She said that those were her instructions and suggested that the rules may have been changed in the past day or two. She was wrong and I was right. But the consequence was a missed flight and the cost of a train fare to a different airport, new ticket, overnight stay in an hotel and half a day of missed work. Wizz Air have declined to give me either compensation or a refund.

### "The worst airline I have used in my life"
The worst airline I have used in my life, I travelled to 16 countries before with different airlines and I haven’t seen airline service like this. My flight got cancelled 9 hours before the departure and they just sent a message saying your flight is cancelled and no reason given. I was traveling by train from a different city to take the flight. When I arrived to the airport they said we will change it to Berlin instead of Hamburg and it will be at 13.10 instead of my actual flight which was at 6.30 in the morning so I have to spend 9 hours on the road because it was a night flight, no hotel accepts us to book even for one night as it was late. The airline said they will compensate us, whenever I called the call centre they said we can’t guarantee that. 1) I wasted my time. 2) Lost €200 transportation to go from Berlin to Hamburg. 3) The airline haven’t offered anywhere to stay. 4. Airport said Wizz members were 100% guaranteed to get a refund but call centre said they can’t guarantee that. 5) Call centre have been so rude. Will never will book with this airline again.

### "unnecessary overzealousness caused me an additional unnecessary expense"
On 17.07.2021 I was supposed to fly to Malta from Warsaw Chopin airport together with my minor son. This was a return flight for us as my son has Maltese citizenship and I have permanent residence is Malta. As per Malta Covid 19 travel guidelines for minors aged 5-12 to take a PCR test 72 hours before travel date I had my son take a PCR test on 14.07.2021 with a negative result. As I approached the Wizz Air desk to check in my luggage ground crew decided not to accept his test because according to them the test expired because it was taken too early in the morning on 14.07. I pleaded with them that Maltese PCR test does not even include a time because only the date is relevant to them. They arm wrestled me, under threat of denying my son check in and boarding, to have my son take another PCR test at the airport which cost 800 PLN (around 200 Eur). This is over and above the 330 PLN I already spent on the first PCR test. When I arrived in Malta I presented to the ground crew checking the Covid 19 documents the PCR test disputed by the Wizz Air ground crew in Warsaw. It was accepted without question. I pointed out to the officer the timing difference but he dismissed it as immaterial. Their unnecessary overzealousness caused me an additional unnecessary expense of PLN 800.

### "will not travel with that airline again"
Not Verified |  I booked my flight and Wizz Air just sent me an email a few days later saying that they changed my flight date without my permission and i had to accept it via my account on Wizz Air, which i could not because i did not have an account. So i made an account, i found my flight but i could not accept it or decline it. I tried to reach a representative in Greece or Cyprus but guess what they do not have one. Anyway i accepted the change by calling at one representative of the countries they do have horrible English. I could not check in online so i had to pay my check in at the airport and now i can not reach to them again. I cannot check in online. I will not travel with that airline again.

### "we had to wait four hours and a half for the flight"
We traveled with Wizz Air from Bari to Bucharest on July 17th 2021. We arrived to the airport three hours before the scheduled time only to find out the flight was in late with one hour and a half. However, Wizz Air made us (group of three people) to pay a fee more expensive than the tickets themselves for allegedly "late check-in". Also, we had to wait four hours and a half for the flight.

### "be avoiding Wizz Air from now on"
I used to consider WizzAir to be efficient and comfortabl, however after this experience I do not think I can fly this airline ever again. The flight was supposed to depart at 17:40 from Rome, however when we get to the airport at 2p.m, we see that it has been delayed until 19:10 with no explanation whatsoever. I check the same flight in previous days, and they have all departed with this level of delay, so there must definitely be something going on here which they do not share with passengers. We had to then spend almost 6 hours at Rome's Ciampino airport, with very, very little to do. The flight then takes off at 19:47 p.m. When we land in Tirana we proceed to have the scariest landing of my life, after the plane violently hits the runway, fails to stop, and then does a go-around. Everyone was panicking and we were once again given no explanation whatsoever for this scary experience after we land. In fact all the flight-attendants said was "I hope you enjoyed this extra tour of Tirana". Absolutely ridiculous. I will be avoiding Wizz Air from now on.

### "Not good at all"
Not Verified |  I bought my flight Bordeaux - Naples, Naples-sofia 2 months ago. The second flight of my trip is with Wizzair who change the hour of my flight 2 weeks before the trip, which i can accept cause i had time to organise myself. But to change the hour of the flight 2 more times on the day of the trip is a joke. Doesn't matter if it's economy class airline company. Not good at all.

### "Definitely staying away from this airline"
I did not end up flying, because the company changed the schedule of my flights 5 times. I had paid the highest fare to be able to change and cancel my flights for free. In the end, although it was the company's fault - after so many schedule changes - the refund was ~$150 lower than the price I originally paid. The reason is that they refund the amount that they arbitrarily think the ticket is worth at the time of the cancellation, and not the fare that was paid! That means I'm lucky they didn't think the ticket was worth $1. Definitely staying away from this airline.

### "I have never experienced a worse service"
I have never experienced a worse service. Our more expensive flight was rebooked from 10pm to 10am, service lines to complain or change it were impossible to find. We tried to check-in online but their own website didn’t work and the login failed. At the airport they charged us additional 80 Euro for the check-in there, even though their own system failed to provide the service. When we asked for a number to complain to, all the staff replied that they are not from the airline and they have no idea whom to contact. Never again.

### "This was my worst flight experience so far"
This was my worst flight experience so far. I was charged 40 euros for check in at the airport. Online check ins were unavailable every time I tried to online check in. Obviously there were a lot more people around me having the same issue. If you ask me that's unacceptable. 1 hour and 30 minute delay of the flight. The plane in bad condition. Old. Staff were nice. I am not going to consider flying with Wizz again, nor recommend it.

### "refund options are not easy to use"
The flight was cancelled. It seems that the airlines are trying to solve their cash flow problems by allowing you to book the flight and then cancelling it. The refund options are not easy to use. At website I was able to refund the price of the ticket only to my Wizz account credits. I had to call the customer service in order to convert that credit into money. I was promised that money will be refunded to my bank account within 10 days. Let's see.

### "lack of action towards enforcing Covid safety"
I would like to make a formal complaint about the crew on the Wizz Air morning flight from Luton to Cluj from the 11th of June, regarding their lack of action towards enforcing Covid safety rules and regulations. Many of the passengers on the flight were either not wearing masks at all, or wearing them in such a way that it was neither covering their mouth nor their nose. I initially kindly asked some of the infringing passengers to properly wear the mask, to which they first ignored me and then they started making insulting comments towards me in Romanian (I speak the language so I understood what they said). When I raised this issue with members of the crew, they shrugged me off and told me that there is nothing they can do about it and that I should sort this issue. I do not believe that it is the job of passengers to enforce basic covid safety rules, and I also believe that the airline has a duty of care towards all its passengers. The incident made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe during the entire duration of the flight. Moreover, I noticed that during the entire duration of the flight, no member of the flight crew took any measure or said anything towards other rule infringing passengers, not even when passengers without masks were passing by them on the corridor. I find this to be unacceptable, for a member of the flight crew to pass multiple infringing passengers on the corridor and not do even as much as ask them to follow international guidelines and regulations regarding safety during the Covid Pandemic. I am very disappointed in this and will think twice from now on about flying or recommending WizzAir to others.

### "the whole practice is a disgrace"
Used Wizzair pre pandemic happily and successfully. I used to like them and used often for flights to many countries. But alas, the airline has changed! Now it feels that they are solving their cash flow problems by allowing new booking only to cancel them later, often “at the last minute” (a few hours before the flight). My flights to Moscow in June 2021 were cancelled twice, second time I was already in a hotel near the airport as the flight was very early morning, so had to come in the ending. So I lost money on transport, COVID test and hotel. My friends flight to St Petersburg was also cancelled, she opted for a refund which is promised in 30 days… Good luck with that. When they cancel the flight, they offer refund or re-book, but refund only for “new” money, not if your used credit accumulated with them during pandemic for the past cancelled flights… so I had to re-book. And since then my booking was cancelled or amended three more times within 2 days. Dates get pushed further and further away from originally booked flights, like a month and a half later. I checked availability on site prior rebooking and noticed that tickets price is 3-4 times higher than mine… so my guess is that my booking is being bumped off as they sell tickets for much higher price! Or may be they don’t intend to fly at all, just collect new payments anyway to save themselves…. In addition some add-on services are NOT refundable as it turned out, specifically “provided by partners”. Once after cancellation and request to add credit to the account I discovered that around £18 “disappeared” without explanation. I’m not sure what “service” was deducted. I only had “priority” added, I wouldn’t have thought it was a partner service. Either way the whole practice is a disgrace resulting in very disappointing.

### "experience is below standards"
Not Verified |  We use to travel Wizz Air regularly. Price are not to bad depending on period of year. But our last experience is below standards. I have spoken to 3 different costumer services operator trying to get some information. Staff are not trained, they are not able to answer your enquiries. One of them start to read from some T/C book but able to explain it. Shockingly they are rude too. Told me to come to Airport and they will decide there if my son can fly or no. They said they were unable to send confirmation for this conversation, they don't respond email as they policy. Train your team, create easier way to communicate with your costumers. Cr

### "We have had our flights changed 4 times"
Not Verified |  Wizz Air is the worst airline. We have had our flights changed 4 times prior to our trip. After our trip, they changed our flight again and left us stranded in the airport for another 4 days. Do not use this company.

### "I think it's extremely unfair"
I bought the flight ticket for Christmas with protection of Wizz Flex but had to cancel it due to Covid. Wizz Flex allowed me to have a full refund but we started to be in lockdown so I did not even think to fly or even book a flight anywhere. I felt unsafe to fly. Recently I check my Wizz Air account and realized that my funds are expected and they actually expired today so I contacted Wizz Air thinking that due to Covid they will give me my money back and I will have longer time to buy a ticket as we are in UK lockdown but it did not happened so I lost money and I was late a few hours maybe. I think it's extremely unfair. How someone can use money and buy a ticket if flying is actually not safe during Covid?

### "I am very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Few days ago, i had a ticket da Milano a Tirana. I payed 11€ for extra bag 10kg, when I arrived in airport they took from me an extra 30€ for bag. I am very disappointed. Another case, when I postponed my ticket from 90€ which I paid, they gave me just 10€. I did the same thing with Air Albania and the gave me back all the money without any fee.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service, useless is the best word. They have no clue about their company’s policy, if asked to give a manager or someone else to speak to, they refuse. So they are denying one of our rights. Was refused boarding to me and my kids for an absurd reason, when I confronted them that their policy does not state such thing they were looking for different stupid reasons to deny boarding. Rude boarding staff and unprofessional. When made the complaint to them to refund my fly tickets money, had the same bad experience with their staff. They gave me a link to complain to European Commission and also gave me 2 other websites in Hungarian language to look for details I needed. I felt they were making fun of me with those websites. Obviously I don’t know a word in Hungarian.

### "fulfilled their part of the agreement"
I have had a mixed experience with Wizz Air in the past. In December 2020 my flight was cancelled, and I was trying to receive the money-back. Wizz Air fulfilled their part of the agreement within few weeks. I know that completing online forms and changing wizzair account to a bank account and losing 20% was a bit annoying, time-consuming and confusing. However, in the current situation, I have to say- well done Wizzair. I  sent an inquiry email two weeks ago, received the reply 6 days later stating that the money was transferred already some time ago.

### "Never have I experienced such appalling customer service"
Not Verified |  Never have I experienced such appalling customer service. I have been waiting to travel to Sofia for months now and they denied me boarding without any justifiable reason. The manager at the check in desk was incredibly rude and disrespectful. I was asking him for advice and trying to speak to him and he just kept ignoring me and said 'I've got a queue to deal with'. I has on the phone to Wizz Air customer service twice and both times they were very useless just trying to close the phone as quickly as possible. Please avoid this airline at all costs! Only reason I decided booking with them is because they are the only airline travelling during Covid but after this experience I will never be flying with them again.

### "Avoid Wizz Air like the plague"
Probably the only airline that doesn’t provide carry on hand luggage. What the airline considers as “carry on” would be the equivalent of a “wallet”. I have no problem paying, I just don’t like the fact the airline tries to charge as your boarding the plane. If the ticket does not include carry on then make this clear. It was evident 95% of the plane didn’t know, as they were all shocked they were charged whilst waiting by the gate. Avoid Wizz Air like the plague or Covid-19 and the unprofessional Wizz air staff at Gibraltar airport.

### "stay away from Wizz Air!"
Not Verified |  I planned to utilize a credit from a cancelled flight, and booked a ticket. I selected 'use my credit' option, but they anyway charged my credit card (details were stored with my profile since last booking). After I realized my credit card was charged for full amount I immediately called the customer service. Firstly, like no other companies they extra charge those phone calls at rate 10 SEK per minute, and on top of it let you wait few minutes. They are not willing to help, and the only answer you get is no, regardless of the question. I cannot use my credit for this ticket, they want reimburse me and cannot utilize the credit to book a ticket for my wife. So now, I feel cheated and humiliated. Besides, I have pretty bad experience from flying with them before, did not travel with them for years and now I can see they managed to become even worse since then. After this I can only advise - stay away from Wizz Air!

### "extremely poor customer experience"
Not Verified |  In case of any type of issues that involve Wizz customer service (e.g. flight cancellation, delays), one will be 100% unpleasantly surprised by the low quality Wizz offers in this segment Actually there is no appropriate support whatsoever. Despite the online "fill in complaint" or phone contact (at very high costs in case someone answers), Wizz Air treats its customers with indolence and ignorance. Best case one gets a standardized complaint confirmation answer and nothing else. Despite iterations Customer experience is greenfield for this airline company and anyone booking with them should reckon with extremely poor customer experience.

### "don't expect this company to help you whatsoever"
I paid £49.50 to have my bag transported in the hold but it did not arrive at the destination. The baggage handler assured me this would be sent onto my accommodation but this did not happen. I was unable to contact anyone from Wizz Air or their baggage handler Avia Partner who was able to help. Neither company had an open office at the airport. As I had no luggage whatsoever, I was forced to curtail my trip. I later found out that my bag had been held at Gatwick and no attempt had been made to send it onto me. Wizz Air have declined to reimburse me for expenses incurred apart from basic toiletries and underwear. The worst thing is they haven't agreed to refund the hold baggage fee even though this is a service that was never provided! The bottom line is don't expect this company to help you whatsoever if things go wrong. You would have more luck shouting at a brick wall.

### "customer service is extremely rude"
I couldn't legally travel and the airline refused to refund or allow a change of flight. I've asked for a statement that they won't provide a refund so that I can claim it through insurance and they refuse to provide one. The customer service is extremely rude and absolutely useless! Their website doesn't even make sense, none of their customer emails work, if they cant set up a proper email I wouldn't trust them to fly a plane.

### "told me the flight is canceled"
Not Verified |  Wizz Air is a low cost airline. Nevertheless if you have a ticket for this flight it is a comment way of Wizz Air to wright to customer with extremely low price tickets that the flight is canceled but this is not true. It happens to me with the flight on the 19th of December from Larnaca to Dortmund. Wizz told me the flight is canceled and after several complains were not answered. In the same time they ask my partner to check in. All the email correspondence are with me.

### "must pay at the airport to check in"
The wont say in the email that IF you don't check in online then you must pay at the airport to check in. Such a cheap way to make money! So misleading. The staff isn't helpful at all. I will never fly with this terrible airline again!

### "staff rude and unhelpful"
The worse experience ever had! The staff rude and unhelpful. They refuse to give me their name or show me their badge also they speak between them in their language. They did not allow me to fly for a single mistake typing on the government form. Plus, there is not any refund and our holiday destroyed, as the Covid test is accepted just for 72 hours. Such a unprofessional staff. It is definitely last time when use their company.

### "charge for everything extra"
The worst airline. You have to pay for 10kg baggage and cannot take it to airplane. They charge for everything extra and prices are like BA. Ridiculous.

### "They will not refund your money"
I booked a flight a while back to travel in March of 2020. But COVID-19 happened. I received a voucher for flight credits and was able to convert it back to cash to get my refund on my card. From March 2020 to now December 2020 I have still only received half of my refund. There is no number for Americans to call so I am stuck emailing. Everything went fine and I was initially told my refund would be processed. Months went by and I had only received half of it in May. I emailed again in July and by August or September I was told in 14 to 20 business days I would receive the other half. Over a month went by and nothing. I contacted once more in November and this time they sent “a receipt as proof that the payment was sent out” I guess they got tired of hearing from me and the next time I try to make a claim they will say they it was already sent out and the receipt is proof. They might has well has returned my flight credits. Choose another airline, these people are ripoffs. They will not refund your money.

### "don't want to send me a refund"
Wizzair changed my flight and don't want to send me a refund because according to them I have accepted the new dates which is not true. Also i read about somebody that is compainin about the "payable seat" and it is true. you have to pay in any case 10 euro for leg per each passenger! Stay away from them!

### "I waited and no money is coming"
Not Verified |  I bought flight tickets on 29th of August, after less than a week I got an email that the flight was cancelled. I asked for a refund, it was very hard to even ask for it cause they sent me to different places till finally found the right person. They said they would refund the money. Ok so I waited and no money is coming so I contacted my bank for a Chargeback and they are taking care of it as we speak.

### "Be very wary of this airline"
Not Verified |  I cannot claim to submit the worst review of Wizz Air because others have had some pretty horrific experiences, but their current system of allocating seats prior to check-in is almost certainly bending the law to breaking point. They are very clearly stating on the website that you can check-in between 3 and 48 hours before the flight and a seat will be allocated to you for free. This is patently not true as they are blocking any form of on-line check in unless you buy a seat (currently we are 14 hours before take off and this is still the case). So, we wait to see if they will honour this commitment. Be very wary of this airline, they are playing loose and free. Give me Ryanair any day.

### "silence so far and no one interested to check with me"
Not Verified |  Due to the covid-19 lockdown I had to cancel my flight. I asked for a refund. They sent me an email to choose a refund in my account or in my bank account. I answered that my refund should be into my bank account. I received the same email a couple of times and I gave the same answer. Then...nothing but silence. After a while I received an email telling me that the money had gone onto my Wizz account because I didn't submit my choice of how they should process my refund. I said to myself that in the end it is not too bad because sooner or later I will need to use the Wizz flights. Last week I checked my account and big surprise, no money in my account. I sent an email, receiving an automated registration email, but silence so far and no one interested to check with me.

### "the only thing cheap was their service"
Not Verified |  Gdansk to Trondheim with Wizz Air. Thought I had bought some cheap tickets home. Turns out the only thing cheap was their service. Loads of different hidden fees made the ticket three times more expensive once at the airport.

### "Worst Customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst Customer service I have experienced, ever. Its been more than 6 months and still not been able to fully recover refund for cancelled flight back in March 2020. Every time you call, you get told different information, no reply to emails. Eventually received some funds, but not the full amount due to their error, It takes another 14 to 20 working days apparently to receive funds, so after waiting long again, its quite disappointing to find out only tiny amount has been refunded again, another error. Why do I have to beg for money that I am entitled to? Avoid if you can

### "Wizz Air is running a check-in racket"
While the service overall is similar to other low cost airlines (for example no leg space, charging extra for everything, etc. ), Wizz Air is running a check-in racket: 1) As with other airlines you can check-in online, but unlike other airlines you have to pay to do that. No, it is not just for your preferred seats, but irrespective of which seats you select and occasionally you can't even do that. Note that the Wizz Air online check-in closes 3 hours before departure! 2) To not pay for the check-in, according to the Wizz Air website, is possible at the airport by using the self-service check-in, and if those are not available at the traditional check-in desk. 3) However, this is not the case. At Milan Malpensa Terminal 1 on Friday, and at Vienna Terminal 3 on Sunday (today), there was no self-service check-in available (I confirmed this with the available check-in staff), and the traditional check-in counter would only check us in if we paid €15/person. 4) This is not all, at MXP the payment is handled by another desk which charges a €5/person commission and at VIE the commission is €5/transaction. So when you book with Wizz Air you need on paying at least €7-8 for the check-in online, or €15 if you do so at the airport plus €5 commission. This is not an optional extra service! By the way, the check-in staff cannot help you because they "do not work for Wizz Air" (they told me this in both MXP as well as VIE). They did confirm however that many other customers had the same "problem" as me.

### "Horrible customer service"
Vienna to Eindhoven with Wizz Air. My booking was not confirmed due to some payment issue and I reached out the the customer service 8 times to resolve the issue. I even paid for the customer call center where I was told that the issue would be resolved. Nothing happened and in the end I could not take my flight. Horrible customer service. I will never consider the airline again.

### "Never gonna fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Me and my husband used Wizz Air for the first and the last time. Everything was quite alright before we had to come back to Italy. We have paid 20kg luggage. From Italian airport we were going with slightly heavier suitcase. And we know by experience that on almost empty flights it’s not a problem. They checked us in without charging. But in Romanian airport coming back they charged us 60€ for 7 kg overweight. Can you imagine that we paid 51€ for 20kg both ways and now they charge us for 60€ in PLUS for 7kg. And the problem is that I would gladly pay adequate sum of money for those 7kg but they prefer to lose clients for one time profit. And yeah they sent us the bill for 40€ and when we told that we paid 60€ they said that another 20€ it’s airport service. Also they broke my suitcase lock. Never gonna fly with them again and do not advice to you if you have luggage.

### "I will avoid them at all costs"
Not Verified |  Wizz Air lost my luggage on the 31st August from Barcelona to Katowice. No one called me to update me about the status. 2.5 weeks later I received a piece of luggage to my home address and this is not my luggage! There is no way to contact them, no one is picking up the phone and no one is responding to emails. I will avoid them at all costs!

### "charged me twice for my flight"
Wizz Air charged me twice for my flight because of an error on their website. It happened in December 2019. It is now September 2020 and I still have not been issued with a refund. Wizz Air has already said twice that they issued me with a refund, but they never did. The worst customer service ever. Never flying with Wizz Air again.

### "Absolutely disgusting"
Absolutely disgusting. Terrible service from the beginning to the end. Multiple extra charges for reasons which were not made clear anywhere on the website or in emails sent by Wizzair. Looks cheap, but in reality will end up more expensive than every reputable airline out there, just lacking leg room and given a slab of plastic for a headrest.

### "the worst airline company"
Has to be one of the worst airline company I have ever dealt with. Refused entry to board at the gate because an attendant could not understand what a flight pass is even though the Wizz Air website suggested the form is filled to gain entry. Manager dealt with the situation after the plane left then couldnt care less what happens after that. No customer service as it is all online (thank goodness for credit cards).

### "a company to avoid"
Budapest to Lisbon. Worst company I have ever flew with. I will never again travel in this company. The tickets are cheap but after that any extra is overcharged unless one is traveling with a backpack this is a company to avoid. Beside all of to have any safety regarding any any last minute restrictions like now due to COVID buying an extra insurance is the only way to get your money back. While on the first CIVD wave I had the money refunded by the insurance company, now on the so called 2nd wave Hungary was refusing to let me enter the country, Wizz Air refused to return the money or even refund me the value in vouchers for the flight I had booked 3 weeks before the Hungarian government announced restrictions to foreigners. I flew on Wizz Air on the 22nd of August 2020 and this was the last time I did it.

### "not pay you legal compensation"
Wizz air cancel flights at a day's notice and will not pay you legal compensation you are entitled to. Cabin crew are usually attentive and professional. They should resume domestic flights in Portugal.

### "They make Ryanair look good"
Just terrible. Everything is an extra charge. Even booster seat for child. They make Ryanair look good. Insufficient ground staff means you better enjoy queuing too, and be sure to get to the airport very early. Be warned!

### "never fly with Wizz Air again"
As I was browsing through the additional services offered by Wizz Air, the Wizz Air website wrongfully redirected me while purchasing Wizz priority for my return flight and led me to purchase an additional baggage for my outbound flight. I tried to contact Wizz Air's customer service as soon as I completed the payment through their payment phone numbers but the operators refused to help me, arguing the website was working. I assure you it's not. I was using the Chrome browser on my desktop computer and the website probably messed up between different services I had been browsing. As a result, upon an expense of 26€ for my outbound and return flights, I had to spend a total of 34€ for Wizz priority and an additional 31€ for the wrongfully purchased additional 10kg luggage. Furthermore, no protection against the Covid-19 emergency is adopted in flight. Passengers are seated really close and the flight attendants do not warn those who are not properly wearing a mask. I will never fly with Wizz Air again.

### "service was absolutely despicable"
Not Verified | After last year returning from Turkey with Wizz air being charged and extortionate amount for a few kilos of excess baggage I swore that I would never ever use them again but because of the lockdown and flight complications we needed to fly to Athens this summer so I’ve booked tickets from Wizz from Luton to Athens. Again the company's service was absolutely despicable, we attempted to check in 24 hours before could not find two seats together, and when we boarded the plane the pilot assured us that the flight was full. On observation after take off there was at least 15 pairs of empty seats on the plane. In view of the current situation with lockdown and the airline industry I think they would be well advised to liven up their act and provided a better service.

### "Good experience all round"
Only my second time to fly with Wizz air. I got a ticket for £25 return. Then you pay for various extras. I paid for 10KG luggage I didn’t actually need. I thought I was signing up for priority but to be honest I did the booking quickly and didn’t read everything. Trick is to read very carefully regarding the numerous add on options. I only had a really small bag so didn’t need that add on at all. What I should have done was chose my seating at the time of booking. I waited till after and it ended up costing me more. No doubt about it, their software will stick you in a middle seat, probably far away form anyone else in the booking. Trick is to select your seat at the time of Booking. I am 6 ft so needed an aisle seat. I got this. The flight was manageable for me, even though my other leg was pressing against the seat but it wasn’t uncomfortable. With my other leg in the aisle as much as possible. Was an hour and a half late on the outbound and 30 min late inbound. On the outbound this was an airport issue. New plane. Good take off and landing. On the return MXP to LTN would like to give a special shout out to Marta who was very nice, polite and friendly. Good experience all round. My flight came to £95 with the extras but still cheaper than other airlines. The days of mega cheap fares are still there as long as you have no luggage and take it as it comes. Again £25 for a return to Italy isn’t bad. They handed Covid measures well. They constantly reminded people to wear a mask which was good. But obviously the plane was full. They couldn’t observe social distancing, so of course mask wearing essential. Thanks.

### "ticket was a really good price"
Valencia to Vienna. All-round excellent. The ticket was a really good price. The plane arrived on time. The seats were surprisingly comfortable - leather seats with ample legroom. The staff were professional. Food and drinks were offered for an additional charge. My bags arrived with me.

### "Take your money for no flight and no credit"
Not Verified |  Take your money for no flight and no credit - had return flights for 2nd April, Vienna - Reykjavik - Budapest cost over Aud $2200 cancelled mid March due to Covid and government flight restriction, only premium call rates so had to contact via twitter etc.. Told to manage booking, reverted money to Wizz Air Flexi account and the credit expires 90 days later and yet cannot leave country. They have been far worse than any other airline I have dealt with, nothing short of thieves.

### "ended up with center seats on both sectors"
First experience with Wizz out of Vienna did not start nicely since after booking my trip to Bremen I received an email informing me that my outgoing flight was changed to the following day. Since it was planned to be a 10 days trip I accepted it, soon after that I received another email with the information that my inbound flight was moved forward one day because of "operational reasons". So accepting this again finally meant that my entire trip was cut down from 10 to 8 days. The next point on the downside was that after these changes I got the information that my flights were unable for online check-in. However my partner could check-in online without problems although I was the one with the so called "priority" status. Because of that I ended up with center seats on both sectors. I have to mention that check-in on both airports was smooth and done within 2 minutes. I also have to say that for short flights the Wizz Airseat configuration is acceptable but definitely not what you would get on premium airlines (230 instead of 200 allows an idea how tight everything is). The crew was nice and seemed to be motivated and drinks from the onboard bistro service were sold at reasonable prices. Both flights landed ahead of time and WIZZ managed the new COVID procedures very well and distributed the necessery health declarations during boarding. Would I recommend WIZZ for short flights? Yes I would, I would like to believe that the flight changes were owed to the extemporized schedule they still have after the total lockdown of air traffic.

### "never fly with them again"
After Wizz messed up my name on the boarding pass, I was unable to check in online and was charged extra 169 Euro. They then promised a refund, but now 8 months later the money have not come through. I have provided them with all the requested information, but they just stopped answering. Worst customer service of any budget airline. Will absolutely never fly with them again.

### "won't ever be using them again"
I bought the expensive (FLEX or something) ticket for 1 July from Luton to Thessaloniki for 26th July. The Greek Government  said that direct flights from the UK to Greece would continue to not be permitted from 1 July (they were not permitted during June, and they were thinking of allowing them from 1st July onwards, but changed their minds, and first announced that on 26th June). He also said that the official announcement was going to come out on 29th June. I didn't want to wait till 1 day before my flight for WizzAir to cancel it (and I found out from others that they ended up cancelling it on the 30th and a mere 14 hours before the actual flight), thus I tried to book another flight. In that effort, I ended up cancelling my ticket which led to the first ridiculous policy they have - it takes 72 hours for them to put the "refunded" money into a "Wizz Air account", why 72 hours? The second ridiculous policy is that after they added it I would only have 3 months to book another flight with them, otherwise they keep the money, which is ridiculously short even for pre-COVID times, it should be 12 months at least, and probably 24 or 36 now that COVID is around. I would have found that reasonable. But regardless, I couldn't wait 72 hours to book another flight with them, so I ended up booking with another company for my actual flight. Once the 72 hours passed, my money was added to the "Wizz Air Account", after which I proceeded to try to get a refund to one of my actual bank accounts. In that process, they ask for the reason for the refund, and they have two new options "Cancellation initiated by Wizz Air due to COVID" and "Cancellation initiated by customer due to COVID" - I picked the second option, assuming that there is a difference from a similar cancellation pre-COVID times, and thus that I would actually get a refund (otherwise what's the point of having such an option). Apparently, cancelling my flight due to COVID (a flight which was gonna get cancelled for sure by them eventually) and having bought the more expensive ticket wasn't enough to get a refund. They hide behind T&C and maybe legally they are ok with doing so, but personally I find this bad practice, ridiculous, and won't ever be using them again.

### "I had two flights cancelled"
In the space of less than a month I had two flights cancelled, one from Lisbon to Vienna and back due to covid-19 reasons, and the other from Lisbon to Belgrade because they decided to start the operation one month later. I currently have both cases at court for compensation and all the extra costs that were non-refundable, namely accommodation. Can't think of a worst experience than this and made me really sad because I always wanted to visit Serbia.

### "Absolute nightmare"
Not Verified | I booked 24 tickets for a wedding party. Flight cancelled due to Covid. Unwritten rule says I can now only rebook 5 tickets. Absolute nightmare - no idea how to solve this On twitter you can only have 2 replies then they ignore you. Group booking is a premium call, Emails are unanswered. All I want is to swap 24 Covid cancelled tickets for 24 new tickets - why is this a big problem? Word of warning - if there are more than 5 of you they have different, unwritten rules - go elsewhere if you can, or fall foul of the rules as they make them up.

### "charges you a criminal amount"
Not Verified | With the Covid 19 issues I booked Wizz Air's most expensive fully flexible fare, with the reasonable assumption of getting my money back. However on cancelling this just goes into a wizz-flex account to use as expiring credit. I thought I would be able to try a claim from there call centre, however, it just puts you on hold forever and charges you a criminal amount - Total thieves.

### "pursuing Wizzair through the County Courts"
My wife and I have had accounts with wizzair for over 10 years and fly with them at least 4 times a year. Never really had a problem with them but had a few IT issues which have always been resolved over the phone. Before covid 19 lockdown booked 4 flights with them which 1 they cancelled and the other 3 could not be taken due to the fact that the first flight was cancelled. They basically told me to go away and accept 25% refund or nothing!! They argued the remaining 3 flights were available and it was up to us to turn up for them even though it was impossible to do so. We then booked 4 flights for later in the year, when we got conformation they had charged for extra luggage we didn't want, we contacted them immediately AND before the transaction was complete , the money was still in our account, Guess what! Our fault we`re taking the money make a complaint! Then we notice that one of the ticket had the my christian name on it not my wifes. We immediately contacted them, Guess what!!!! You`re fault pay 45 euros or lose the flight!! Wizz Air have definitely changed their customer care from good to tell everyone to go away! We understand it is difficult for airlines at this moment but brutal and rude response to genuine enquiries is not the way to treat long standing honest and decent clients. Regrettably, we will be pursuing Wizzair through the County Courts which seems to be the only way to take them to task. Sad day.

### "flight attendants were friendly"
Luton to Budapest, great value for the money, seat is spacious for me (I am 5,5). Service was good and the flight attendants were friendly. there is no inflight entertainment but  this is a budget airline so I wouldn’t expect anything. The plane seemed very clean.

### "Customer service is absolute shambles"
Not Verified |  Customer service is absolute shambles! I contacted Wizz Air on 15/06/20 at regarding my booking to enquire what my cash refund would be if I were to cancel my flights. The agent I was speaking to confirmed that an amount of £1221.00 would be refunded back to my credit card. The difference between what I actually paid £1609 is what they are charging as a cancelation charge. The agent further clarified that the amount of £1221.00  would be credited to my credit card account within 2/3 weeks. Upon being given this information and only because this information was given to me I agreed to cancel my booking. Shortly after cancelling the aforementioned booking I made an entirely new booking for the same flight & date for only £670.00. I called Wizz Air again just to re-confirm that I should expect the refund to my credit card no later that within 2/3 weeks only to be told that the agent I spoke to on 15/06/20 with whom based on the information they had given me & proceeded to cancel my original flights with had in fact given me incorrect information & that I would not be receiving a refund to my credit card but instead the amount of £1221 would be credited to a Wizz Account and that I would need to use this credit within 3 months!! This agent proceeded to advise me that Wizz Air cannot be held responsible for a colleagues error which is an absolute ridiculous & totally unacceptable statement to be made. Without the refund as promised by Wizz Air our holiday is now in jeopardy in addition we stand to lose our deposit for the accommodation which was booked independently from Wizz Air as we now have only until 18/06/20 to confirm that we still want the accommodation. WizzAir have breached the agreement made with me & in addition are legally responsible for the actions of its employees. my complaint was closed as I did not respond the confirmation email “thank you for submitting your enquiry. We will look into this and contact you ASAP.  A representative advised this is because I did not respond saying thank you!

### "flight has just been cancelled"
Not Verified |  My flight has just been cancelled, no explanation whatsoever. I thought the restriction period has been extended but it's not the case. So I started booking again the next available flight. And if on my original booking I had a package with priority boarding and large trolley on board, they only gave me back the priority boarding (useless by the way) so I had to pay another £30 on top of my original booking for nothing. The only way to contact them is through a call centre which charges a fortune (so stay away from it). This company used to be a lot better some years ago but it got worse and worse, year after year. I remember when I used to get £60 flights with return from UK to Romania and with £25 extra for a membership you would get benefits like priority boarding, free seat selection and extra large trolley. And it was ok if the services were not the best as you wouldn't pay for premium. But now you pay a fortune and you get the same lousy services like before.

### "Worst airline ever"
I was trying to do check in on line but my phone battery was dead I needed a plug or a place where to charge my phone been told to wait outside and come back 1 hour before depart. I couldn't check in then when i went to check in desk they asked me the boarding card i explained what happen but they didn't want hear any reason. I had to pay 35 euro for a print on a piece of paper and then I received a receipt of 30 euro then went back and show the receipt then i got the pass. I had 2 bag with me just hand bags and they asked me i had to pay for one OK 25 euro but the receipt was 20 euro. Also the flight was 45 minutes late and nobody even apologise. Worst airline ever.

### "basically could not care less"
Birmingham to Tel-Aviv via Bucharest. We  booked with Wizzair for a flight in April. When asked for refund was not given enough information between vouchers or refund so chose refund and was notified that we will have 30% of what we have paid. Asked to speak to a manager, on a phone line that cost me £20 for 8 minutes. No manager wanted to speak to me and try and help. They know they are going down so basically could not care less. They know that none of us will fly with them again. The only option is to get the insurance companies/bank get the money back.

### "customer service staff is very rude"
Not Verified |  Booked family tickets with baby and my wife and we were allocated separate seats, regardless we did check-in 48h before the flight. I called customer service agent, who said he can’t help us and if we want to seat together we have to pay more. Despite I paid for the tickets, luggage + flexible priority tickets. This airline is allocating on purpose separate seats for couples and family to make them pay for seats next to each other. Also their customer service staff is very rude and not helpful at all.

### "customer service is appalling"
Not Verified |  The online booking system is terrible. Nine months befre the flight date, the flight was shown as fully booked, only some of our party managed to get seats. Then the flight disappeared from the online system. A month later it reappeared, only half the seats are booked. So we all book on one flight. Then in February we get told the flight is being rescheduled to overnight flights, meaning some of us can't make it. I choose the refund to credit card option that I am given. In late March I get an invoice that appears to show I'm owed my full flight cost. Since then, nothing. Today I ring up to ask why and I'm told the refund can't be made to my credit card for some bizarre reason, which is why it hasn't been processed. My bank details are required. So that's all been done but now I'm told it will be up to 30 days for the refund to be issued. I'm not holding my breath for this - I can see a credit card refund coming on in July. I've flown WIzzair before and it was OK, no worse than any other budget airline in that respect. Just their customer service is appalling.

### "I will never use Wizz Air"
Not Verified |  My flight to Budapest was cancelled so I opted for a refund. The flight was meant to be 27th march. I am still waiting for my refund. I've called them several times and told my money was refunded but given several different dates, and lasted tried to blame my bank. Its now 29th May and Wizz air owe me nearly £100. Disgusting customer service. Written a complaint, response time is 30 days, disgusting. That will be 3 months wizz air gave nearly £100 of mine. I will never use Wizz Air and certainly won't recommend.

### "Very abusive behavior"
Wizz Air - decided to fly without passengers! They didn't give us an option to change our flight for free during this pandemic time! Do you know that under European law, you should give us money back. I will make all the complaints that are necessary! Very abusive behavior.

### "customer service is the worst"
This company customer service is the worst of the worst. There is no where where you can talk about your flights problems! I had booked two flights from London to Budapest and the sec Budapest to Athens to go home during this cover 19. I am not allowed to leave the transit area but they didn't mention that anywhere and they sold to me 2 times luggage of 20kg and they don't want even think to refund my that or to consider me like transit passenger and help me with my drop of luggag. So I am ending up after 5 mont in UK on my way to home without my personal belongings. They are not helpful at all.

### "the flight should have been cancelled"
I bought return tickets for my entire family (5 persons, one of which 3 years old) for the above mentioned flights in October 2019. The flight was scheduled for 19 May 2020. Given the worldwide pandemic crisis, lockdown restrictions were set in place by the government of Romania and UK. As such, I called WizzAir customer service at the beginning of April 2020 to enquire about the flight status. I was advised that the flight was still going ahead as planned and that passengers will be informed about cancellations due to Covid19 via email (when applicable). When I asked about the notice period I was informed there is not a set notice period and it could vary from 2 weeks to next-day cancellation notice. WizzAir personnel advised me not to cancel my booking as yet and wait for further communication closer to the flight date, and that if I still wanted to cancel the flights due to the Covid19 pandemic and further restrictions inposed by government then I should do so 14 days prior to flight date to ensure I am not charged additional cancellation fees. I called customer service again on the 1st of May 2020 and I was advised the flight is still going ahead as scheduled and if I wanted to cancel the flights WizzAir will charge 60 Euros/person/flight. This is unacceptable considering the current worldwide situation, and more specifically the restrictions imposed by the government. The UK is under lockdown with no end date in sight (at the point of this complaint), which means all non-essential travel is not permitted. Additionally, social distancing restrictions are further imposed by the Romanian Government and the UK government, including 2 meters distance between people. These measures were not respected. As such, the flight should have been cancelled, in line with government guidelines. It is not acceptable for a company not to adhere to Government guidelines and put customers at risk. I find it appalling that flights are not cancelled in advance by WizzAir (given specific lockdown instructions set by the government) and that passengers are required to cancel the flights more than 14 days prior to the flight so that the cancellation fees are not increased. It is absurd to charge the cancellation fee per person per flight and not per booking, meaning that the customer receives a 10th of the price paid. Based on the information I received from the WizzAir staff, the flight cancellation period varies from 2 weeks to 1 day. This means WizzAir deliberately does not adhere to WHO and Government (country specific) guidelines and restrictions, so that they can retain most of the price paid by customers when booking flights. Aside from this blatant disregard for pandemic restrictions, the customer service personnel was rude and dismissive over the phone, with no willingness to discuss the options available for customers. When I was given the information relating to the cost of cancellation, the call handler was abrupt and repeatedly asked me "Should I cancel this or not? without allowing me the time to process the information received and to calculate/ understand how much will all this cost.

### "won't even allow flight changes"
Due to Covid-19, the Hungarian government has banned entry for British Nationals. Wizz Air has decided they will not only refuse refunds, but they won't even allow flight changes for those who are unable to travel. They would be forced to prevent me from flying due to my nationality, and yet tell me that my flight is still flying and I therefore cannot change it. Considering they have applied for and received UK government assistance, this is appalling behaviour. The government needs to attach strings to their bailout money.

### "an awful company!"
Not Verified |  Wizz Air is an awful company! I booked 2 tickets for 2 people from Luton to Satu Mare, the main reason being my cousin's wedding. Due to Covid-19 the wedding was cancelled so I wanted my money back or at least credit for future travel. First of all, they modified the return flight on 15.03 before knowing the wedding was cancelled. I accepted as they pressed me with emails every day to make a quick decision. After 1 week from conformation, the wedding was called off. I asked them for a refund but no chance. My partner, the second passenger was diagnosed with cancer recently. He is unable to travel in the near future. I could not be bothered to call them again, given the amount they charge for calls. No email address at all for correspondence! I filled a complain and got in touch with my card provider. Now I am waiting 14 days for Wizz Air to answer to my complain, otherwise the card provider will open a case for me. They are obscured people who try everything just to get money out of customers. Unfortunately they have monopoly in many European Eastern countries and especially in smaller towns airports. I wish I have accepted the refund when they modified the return flight.

### "not cancelling the flight"
I have a ticket for a flight from Bucharest to Luton for 24 April, but in Romania the government suspended all flights from and to UK. Wizz air is not cancelling the flight as they will have to pay the money back to customers.

### "prefers to fly with empty planes"
Not Verified | Sofia to London. My husband and I were supposed to travel to London and visit our daughter for Easter (Outbound airport: Sofia). For obvious reasons, unfortunately, we had to cancel our trip. After trying to reach out to Wizz Air via phone multiple times (PS. not to mention the costs for doing so) without success, we tried to cancel our flights online. According to the information on the airline's website, we could do so against GBP 40 or so cancelation fee per person. The remaining amount - i.e. the difference between what we paid and cancellation fees - was supposed to be loaded as a voucher/credit on my Wizz Air account. Well, nothing like that! Majority of the airlines out there, including low budget ones, waved their cancellation and rebooking fees more than a month ago. It seems that Wizz Air is trying to make "the best" out of the current situation and prefers to fly with empty planes, thus more CO2 emissions, overtaking reasonable actions and providing fair customer service. Hoping that someone from Wizz Air reads this, I just want to say: We will get out of this situation, we will be traveling again, but it will never ever be with you, dirty speculators! You may survive the next few months by scamming people, but sure as hell your future won't be as bright considering your ridiculously unethical business model.

### "6.5 hours without water, food"
Budapest to Tel Aviv in December 2019. 6.5 hours without water, food. There was 6 hours delay, 4 hours on the plane and the staff didn't give us water or food, not even to go to the toilet. 2 hours from the six hours in a small place with a small toilet, no food, no drinks only security. After take off they brought us water and sandwich. When i asked them to explain why, they said nothing happened it is not my business.

### "Great overall experience"
Eindhoven to Budapest with Wizz Air. Great overall experience. Speedy check in with friendly ground staff. Smooth boarding process. On board, with only 18 passengers, we were free to choose where to sit. Cabin crew extra friendly and eager to please.

### "not treated with respect"
Not Verified | Birmingham to Bucharest. It used to be good value for money, but with all taxes attached you better choose another company that will offer you a good service. If you need to call customer services get ready to pay a massive amount for nothing. I tried to change my flight date (for two tickets I paid £130 and to change dates after taxes etc. the amount came up to £377, ridiculous. At the end I had to buy a new ticket that cost me £250). So disappointed about the way customers are treated by this fly company. I will definitely look for a better option in the future. At the end, customers are the one keeping travel industries on top, and if not treated with respect customers have maybe better choices as the market is full of flying option.

### "incompetent cowboys"
Not Verified |  I will never use this company again, first we get an email stating that we cannot fly. So we don't book in, then we get another email stating we can claim our refund after two weeks. This claim will be covered via another email, other couples we were flying with receive said email and have no issue. Our email doesn't come, we ring, 40 mins on the phone, they put the phone down because they can't sort our request. Another 30 mins on the phone, "we are not doing refunds anymore - you can only have flight credits! Another statement they made is we could only claim our return flight? 3 Weeks on and I am still chasing a refund. I would rather walk home then fly with these incompetent cowboys.

### "stealing money from customers"
Not Verified |  Luton to Poznan. Wizz Air is stealing money from customers that flights were cancelled! If your flight is cancelled due to COVID 19 you get an email saying you can claim 120% of original fair to your wizz account or 100% refund to your original payment method. I went to the wizz air website logged in and followed the refund instructions. It said that I need to first claim 120% of the original fair to my wizz account and then I can claim the 100% original payment to my card which I found strange! Why can I just claim 100% refund straight away! However, then I noticed that the 120% of the original fare is actually less than it should be by around £10. I am sure they do it on purpose as probably not many people will notice this and they can make money on it! I then had to call a customer service (as this is the only way to contact wizz air) and I was told to send a screenshots of the offered refund to the provided email address and call back next day. Already spent 30 mins on the phone that cost me fortune. I called back next day as advised and I was told that I should have called starlight after sending that email and that they cannot assist me. I then started raging on the phone and eventually the lady said she can process the refund for me. I spend another 30 mins on the phone and again paid fortune for it.

### "don’t care about their customers"
Not Verified |  We were supposed to fly to Bucharest, tomorrow. We have been trying to change the dates or cancel our flights for days now. They want to charge us almost as much to cancel the flights (€160 ex service fees! ), than our tickets initially were. Romania is on lockdown and people who enter are only allowed in if they have family or work. We tried to call them many many times, but every time they put you on hold for 0,90 cents per minute and make you wait close to half an hour every time you call. That’s about €27 per call and that’s just the waiting time. They don’t help you, they just pretend like it’s still safe to go. Because of COVID-19 measurements, I am currently out of a job and I can not keep on spending 27 euros per call, just to hear they can’t help me. All our other friends who we are supposed to go with, but who are travelling with different airlines, got the option to change their travel dates. Wizz Air is terrible, they don’t care about their customers. I will never fly with them again and neither will any of my friends or family.

### "no notification from Wizz Air"
Not Verified |  I got email on 5th March that the schedule of my flight to Italy in April was changed with suggestion of rebooking or cancel of flight. Even though it didn't mention about the deadline of cancel order, a week later, the link was already expired. Strange thing is there is nothing to say about my flight status change in my account page now. I've wanted to cancel the flight but it's impossible to cancel from website and also unable to make a phone call since call center is overloaded. From government order of my country due to corona virus, citizens can't go abroad from now on and my flight also should be canceled but there is no notification from Wizz Air yet. I understand that wizzair has no ability to handle corona virus impact but at least, they should allow customers to cancel the flight from website without cancel fee immediately, not trying to rip off to charge expensive call fee from customers to cancel flight in this emergency situation.

### "most negative experiences"
My flight from Budapest to Athens was one of the most negative experiences, mainly because of the rude behavior of the check-in desk person indicating that I should pay extra for my luggage because I hadn't paid for a "priority" ticket. We came off the plane from Prague, exited the airport and went back in to check in for a next flight with Wizz air. The lady at the check in desk insisted that we were already checked in and told us so with hostility. We told her we had not received boarding passes for this journey and she said in a very sarcastic way that since we were already checked in then we should have received them. She sent us to the office to check our ticket. On our way there we went online (not something always easy in a foreign country) and saw that during our previous trip the boarding passes had arrived. We went to the security control after that. The second person within half an hour of the first incident saw our luggage and waved us over next to her and scolded us for our luggage. Have you paid priority? No? 25 for you and 25 for you! [she meant Euros to allow our luggage in]". The company put myself and my girlfriend 15 rows apart on a plane that was 2/3 empty and asked us to pay 39euros extra to allow us to sit together.

### "I tried to change my ticket"
Luton to St. Petersburg. Booked a flight for the first time with this airline then due to the Coronavirus I was not willing to travel. I tried to change my ticket but they wanted a ridiculous fee which is more than a new ticket. I was not asking for a refund I just wanted to either get credit or change my flight for the next month or two until all this blows over but after waiting on the phone for over 25 mins they said no. Poor service, shame on you all at Wizzair.

### "misleading information"
I am very surprised by the misleading information Wizz air provide to their passengers regarding carry on bags. Was traveling from Eindhoven to Katowice  on flight number W6 1072 and i purchased basic 4 tickets 2 ways including carry on bag of 10kg and i also booked 20 KG extra bag. At the boarding gate i had to pay 25 EUR for the carry on bag which is included in the price, and when i was trying to explain that to the counter girl she was very rude and unprofessional and finally she turned her back and left me talking to the air. Its the last time to fly with Wizz Air.

### "the worst experience"
Brussels to Sofia. Wizz Air is the worst experience every time! Their competitive prices attract you, but once at the airport you sometimes pay double the price of your plane ticket. I use wizzair every year to go to Sofia to see my family and every time I get fucked up. If it is too big a bag, a problem of online check-in I find myself paying up to 70€ more. Sometimes to pass online check-in you have to select seats on the plane, but you have to pay 35 € / person. This time, because the plane was advanced one day, there were problems with online check-in. My husband and I decided to go to the airport earlier to avoid paying the fees. But there again we had to pay € 70 to print our tickets! A shame "We understand but there is nothing we can do the service is blocked". In addition to uncomfortable planes, barbaric schedules, absent customer service, there are delays and cancellations every time. And in the end we pay as much as a normal first class plane. Wizzair is the worst experience every time. They make every trip painful. Wizz Air est à chaque fois la pire expérience! Leurs prix compétitifs vous attirent mais une fois à l’aéroport vous payez parfois le double du prix de votre billet d’avion. J’utilise chaque année wizzair pour aller à Sofia voir ma famille et à chaque fois je me fais avoir. Si c’est un sac trop grand, un problème de check-in online je me retrouve à payer jusqu’à 70€ en plus. Parfois pour réussir le check-in online il faut sélectionner des places dans l’avion, mais il faut payer 35€/personne. Cette fois, parce que l’avion a été avancé d’un jour, il y a avait des soucis de check-in online. Mon mari et moi avons décidé d’aller plus tôt à l’aéroport afin de ne pas payer les frais. Mais là à nouveau on a dû payer 70€ pour imprimer nos tickets! Une honte « Nous comprenons mais on ne peut rien faire le service est bloqué ». En plus des avions qui sont inconfortables, des horaires barbares, un service client absent, on a, à chaque fois des retards ou des annulations. Et au final on paye aussi cher qu’un avion normal en première classe. Wizzair est la pire expérience à chaque fois. Ils rendent chaque voyage pénible.

### "I was denied boarding"
Berlin to Budapest. Unfortunately, I see myself forced to write a negative review for my first and only experience with Wizz Air. If you are a traveller or enjoy visiting new cities please take 2 mins to read this: I had a flight from Berlin to Budapest on 6.12.2019, it was overbooked so I was denied boarding. I contacted the airlines in the next day and until today I didn’t receive the compensation as per the EU regulations. I was accused of not showing up at the counter to take the denied boarding form. This is not true because I showed up in the counter and was given back the check-in money in cash. In addition, I was granted a one night stay at the airport’s hotel and the officers clarified to me to claim the compensation online. So how can I not show up in the counter and take these? I understand that an overbooked flight can just happen but what is not accepted is to spend 40+ days sending several emails to get the compensation. At the moment I am not sure if this review will move something yet I think that when someone reads this will definitely think twice before booking with Wizzair.

### "Ticket was extremely cheap"
Bratislava to Skopje. Departure on time, arrival about 10-20 minutest before scheduled time. Flight was operated by 10y old Airbus A320 (HA-LPX). Interior was clean enough, seats were comfortable, but legroom was horrible. Flight was without any problems, during approach and landing at Skopje airport were severe turbulence, but pilots still made perfectly smooth landing. Boarding was quite slow and gate staff were quite rude, but service during flight was perfect (for low cost company, of course). Ticket was extremely cheap, 250CZK (about 10€) from Bratislava to Skopje.

### "Unfriendly ground crew"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Athens. Lot of delays without providing anything for assisting the passengers. Unfriendly ground crew both in Vienna and Athens. Not helping with informing the customers.

### "will never choose them again"
Bucharest to Catania. WizzAir is claiming to be a low cost but extra and hidden costs make it the same price with reputable airlines (and other companies do care about their customers) They don't care about the customers and in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak in Italy they just don't want to refund or cancel the tickets. They tell me "better to buy Flex next time" Don't worry Wizz Air, I will buy from another company next time. Bad service, bad attitude and will never choose them again.

### "The agent was extremely rude"
Vienna to Cologne. Our flight date was changed. Not the flight time, mind you, no. The date. On the notification email it said we would be able to either accept this change or rebook. We weren't able to rebook via the website, so contacted customer support. The agent was extremely rude and insisted that he couldn't help us because "we had booked the flights through a travel agency", which was simply a lie since we booked it through the Wizz Air website and I also got the confirmation emails from Wizz Air directly. He also couldn't tell me which agency it was supposed to have been. Now we have to either book a new flight without getting our money back for the original one, or book an additional night in the hotel room as well as an additional day for the rental car we need.

### "pay or lose your flight"
The size of the hand luggage is ludicrously small for one piece. During the booking I bought an extra 10kg cabin bag for €52. For some reason the cabin bag that i bought seemed as a "checked in luggage" on my boarding pass which i noticed during the boarding process when an employee of Wizzair charged me €35 extra because i did not "checked in the bag" or "purchased extra the priority pass". Please note that there was nowhere such an option during my booking. The employee was rude and gave me the "option" pay or lose your flight. More than 12 people had the same issue in the same flight and were charged extra. Unfair treatment since other people that had same luggage as mine did not have the same problem.

### "never recommend this airline"
Budapest to Gatwick. Their customer service was quite poor. Though I live in Hungary I come from a Caribbean territory which is part of the commonwealth countries. Note that I was traveling with an infant. After passing immigration at Budapest airport without any issues. The persons at the boarding area for Wizz Air took it upon themselves to question us on whether we needed a visa. When we explained that we didn't and attempted to show both old tickets as well as information on commonwealth territories, they ignored us and rudely spoke over us. Then when they finally acknowledged us they spoke in a very unpleasant tone to tell us to basically be quiet while they get information (information that we already had). They had us just standing there not explaining anything to us with an infant while our flight was boarding. I would never recommend this airline due to their lack of knowledge, poor customer service and product/service quality.

### "reducing their service quality"
Wizz Air never seems to stop surprising with its tendency of maximising their profit and reducing their service quality at the same time. This time we flew from Luton to Sofia  and back. And despite doing everything in the same way as before each time I failed to have all my family sitting together when opting for the automatically allocated seats. And I’m not talking about being split by isle or next row but 5-6 rows apart. So now the only way to have all of us sit together is by paying a premium of 17 Euros per person each way which adds nearly 140€ to our already high fares (half term craze)! I could be listing all minor issues with Wizzair for hours but another major one is the ridiculously low luggage allowance they call “free on-board baggage” which really only allows you to have a small backpack or ladies purse. The only way around it is guess what (?) paying around £50 extra to have a 20kg checked-in bag or purchase priority service which then gives you the same allowance you’d get with every other airline in the world. Finally just to show how bad their service is, when we were being transferred back to Sofia airport and been asked which terminal we’d be flying from, there was no way of getting this information from neither the Wizzair emails, their ticket or even their website. Instead we had to google it and verify from a 3rd party website which is just a joke! Anyway, enough to say that if we had any choice we’d never fly with Wizz.

### "pay extra for check in"
Not Verified |  Just the old school bad company to fly with - not focused at all about guests experience. Could not check in online then forced to pay extra charges for the 2 minutes check in process.

### "dissapointed with attitude"
Luton to Kosice. There was a storm so they delayed a flight from 16:50 to 18:50. I was already in the airport and waiting for delayed flight. Their email arrived at 18:18, saying it that it will be rescheduled to take off 18:00! I checked the flight on the board and it showed as GATE CLOSED. I run to the gate 6 and they said run to gate 28. When I arrived there was only staff packing things up and the plane doors was already shut. Feeling very disappointed about the airline, since I didn't receive call, message and from staff do their best to inform passenger. I believed that plane wont take off an hour earlier than given on the schedule. I missed the flight and got no refund for it. Very dissapointed with attitude as it looks all about money not customer experience. Feeling ripped off.

### "Appalling size of carry on allowed"
Budapest to Luton. Appalling size of carry on allowed. Staff at boarding walk around singling people out to be told to fit bags in the tiny space in front of everyone else. People forced to kneel down in front of monosyllabic empty staff members with no compassion. Utterly degrading. My bag fitted within the checked size but needed readjusting. Unfriendly experience from start to finish. I will never travel with wizz again.

### "Worst flying experience"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Vienna. All bad. Started by charging extra 27EUR for my small trolley. No Portuguese receipt. Bad seats, little space, bad service. Avoid avoid avoid. Worst flying experience ever.

### "can't fault them at all"
Not Verified |  Warsaw to Edinburgh. I was worried after reading bad reviews. I would like to say they were fantastic, probably the best I have flown with. The staff were friendly, plane was comfortable, took off on time, can't fault them at all.

### "could not check in"
Frankfurt-Hahn to Sibiu. Worst airline, website did not work so could not check in. Arrived very early to airport as it said if we arrive 2 hours before flight we will be assisted free of charge. We got there not only to have to pay 70€ (35 per ticket) for them to print a paper worth no more than 10 cents, but were also told that the flight we booked months ago was over booked and we do not have seats due to us not checking in online. Offered no assistance. They are horrible and will never use them again and i advise you to stay away as well. Attached photo of the message we received.

### "worst flight I‘ve ever had"
Cluj-Napoca to Berlin. This is the worst flight I‘ve ever had. The flight attendant just offered some short persons XL chairs, although behind them were very tall persons. The seats are the smallest seats I‘ve ever sat in. I wouldn’t recommend anyone over 185 cm to fly with them. Bad food, bad flight attendants, very small seats and it‘s very cold!

### "I had to stand for half an hour"
Not Verified |  Belgrade to Malta. I wouldn’t recommend Wizz Air to anyone. On the flight to our destination I had to stand for half an hour (which is a third of our flight as it lasted an hour and a half) because the rude cabin crew didn’t want to let me pass from the on board toilet back to my seat. Then, they didn’t inform us that we need to check in for our returning flight (which is possible 3 hours before the flight) so when we arrived at the airport 2 hours before the flight, our tickets were canceled so we had to pay an extra 70 euros for the two of us in order to get back home, which really ruined our overall experience.

### "they just don’t care about their customers"
London Luton to Tirana. I would give 0/10 but that is not an option. The size of the hand luggage is ludicrously small for one piece. When booking I bought the extra size. I was then annoyed to see at the check in those who had larger than the allowed size were being let through without having to pay more, some had two or three bags. The staff were mentioning it was too big to some but letting them through anyway, some they were charging. If the policy is to allow bigger bags fair enough but what is really unfair is my bag was only slightly bigger than the allowed size, so why did others not have to pay for bigger and I did? (I took pictures to prove it). I complained about this via the form on the website and the response had nothing to do with the complaint. I replied saying this and they said it was too late now. Their number is really hard to find but I called and was told I would be transferred, I was put on hold for 20 minutes and then they cut me off. I called back, no apology, I was told someone would call me back that day, a week later nothing. I left messages on twitter, they ignored them – although they “liked” a reply to one of my messages which suggested I called them again, so they were aware but not bothered to try and resolve it. I kept on leaving messages on twitter, eventually they told me to call the number I originally, although that was a battle to get it from them. I called and was told no one on that number could help and as for the lack of service he wouldn’t apologise “as it was nothing to do with him”. He didn’t listen to what I was saying but eventually said he would escalate it and I would get an email – which is rubbish by this point. Over a week later nothing. I am now far more angry about the way they deal with their customers, they seem to want to aggravate them, rather than resolve issues. They put down so many hurdles in the hope we will give up – they just want to take the money and not have to worry about us. It’s a real shame as they could have resolved this in one email, but instead they have proven they just don’t care about their customers.

### "going down hill very rapidly"
Not Verified |  Luton to Kraków . Been flying with Wizz for about four years now. At least three times a year if not more. At first thought it was a good airline and no complaints but now seems to be going down hill very rapidly. Airline staff good but check in staff rude and customer services absolutely appalling. Had so many issues this year so far and it’s only February. I know all airlines reschedule flights but we’ve had six flights changed already and it was an absolute nightmare trying to rebook them. The app wouldn’t let us book and customer services were rude and unhelpful. Took us many attempts speaking to different customers services operators to get it done. We also had to change our parking at the airport which we’d booked with Wizz and ended up being out of pocket by £80 but as Wizz said to us that is not their problem. They just don’t care. After all that stress and having to change leave at work I have now just had another email from them telling me they’ve rescheduled the flights all over again and on top of that I’ve just spoken to customer services and they’re saying I haven’t paid for one of my flights which is untrue. You couldn’t write this stuff! Just a word of warning to all. The number they give on their app for customer services is £1.45 per minute.

### "haven’t give me any refund"
Worst company. They had to cancel the flight from 19.12.2019 from Doncaster to Cluj, and they haven’t give me any refund. I have submitted several complains and they haven’t replied neither. Try to avoid!

### "charged 37 Euros for check in"
Gatwick to Budapest. I would give you zero stars if i could. System would not let me check in online, because Wizz changed our flight time by 20 min. I kept getting error messages. Got to the airport and was charged 37 Euros for check in and another 57 Euros for checking a bag. Everyone i have interaction with from check in to plane was extremely rude and uncaring.

### "everything went extremely smoothly"
Budapest to Oslo. Excellent flight! Honestly, I felt compelled to write a review as after reading reviews here prior to booking my flight I was very nervous to fly Wizz. As a result I bought a top tier ticket in hope things would go more smoothly. This was not required at all! Was a fantastic flight, everything went extremely smoothly. Easy check-in, lots of email reminders and was clearly told of airport fee if don't check in online. Perfectly on time departure and arrival, very orderly boarding and leaving, very helpful and friendly staff. Bag arrived promptly. Comfortable and very clean plane. Friendly pilot. Have taken quite a few budget flights, and this may have been the best. Will very happily fly Wizz again and look forward too!

### "the worst I have had"
Cluj-Napoca to Barcelona, we were asked to pay an extra 35€ per person, because they said we should have checked in online, but that wasn't mentioned anywhere on the ticket. Plus the person there at the desk was very rude. On the return flight, suddenly nobody was allowed to carry the documents small bag, or the women's purse, besides the cabin luggage, because they were considered 2 bags. The boarding was very late, and one of the flight attendants was very rude. I have flown with many companies, but this round trip to Barcelona with Wizz Air was the worst I have had.

### "the flight is overbooked"
Vienna to Malaga. They separated the whole Family. We have booked 4 tickets 2 Adults 2 Kids (7 ,8). Online checkin did not work for us, so we arrived at the airport and had to pay 125 Euros to checkin. We had to run to another terminal to pay this fee, and come back to show the receipt, otherwise no boarding passes?? According to ticket we were allowed to take 4 small bags. We have bought 4 small bags specifically for this trip with a maximum of 6 kg as described (same size as a backpack, but very small trollies). Nevertheless the weight and size didn't matter to checkin staff and they made us pay another 65 euros, since they were not a backpack and looked like trollies. For what reason does Wizzair have weight and size restrictions if they don't stick to . Arriving at the Gate, without any seats assigned we went to the lady at the gate, who told us that the flight is overbooked and we will have to wait until the end with our 2 little kids to see if they can take us. The screen at the gate showed families with children have priority boarding (didn't look like). At the end only my wife was able to board the plane, and I was left behind with my two kids. The third party handling agent at the gate told us to leave the terminal and go outside to the 3rd party ticket counter to get alternative plans. This did dot happen since the had to booked another ticket online at the gate to catch a flight VIE-BCN-AGP, which airline was able to accept us at the gate with bags and without additional costs for checkin and luggage. I would recommend not flying Wizzair, this behaviour should not be tolerated.

### "Absolutely recommended"
Budapest to Berlin. Its nice to have finally the new Terminal in Budapest for Low Cost Airlines. Walked to Aircraft, from the terminal only few steps. Aircraft Landed late from Frankfurt, but Wizz App informed me about 30 Min delay. We landed only 19 minutes delay in Berlin. Bought an aircraft model on board for 10 eur. Absolutely recommended, comfortable seats, nice crew and cheap tickets!

### "Plane was new, nice seats"
Frankfurt to Budapest with Wizz Air. Boarding was on time and comfortable from the terminal building straight in to aircraft. Low cost uses buses at Frankfurt Airport. Plane was new, nice seats and crew has beautiful uniform. Good variety of food on board, I had a nice bottle of wine and a tapas box. Very tasty, Wine was chilled.

### "don't recommend this airline"
Frankfurt to Budapest. This airline has terrible service. I paid for my seat reservation but when I went there, I found that it has been to given to someone else. They gave me alternative seats and all of them are at different places. calls to Customer service have heavy charge. Luggage transfer is terrible, broke handle. Be prepared to travel inside airport approximately 30 mins in bus to board flight. I wrote an email to customer service. They respond to you once in 3 months and also , they acknowledge the issue after 3 months but it will not get resolved. I don't recommend this airline at all. My refund is still pending after they accepted that it is an issue and they will rectify it.

### "Worst company, complete rip off!"
Worst company, complete rip off! Avoid if you can! When this company sees customers they don't see human beings, they see a walking, talking wallet. They add extra costs for everything and make it so that you have to pay for extras. Like for the hand luggage, they keep making it smaller just so you have to buy a bigger one. Food on board is expensive and tastes like cardboard. When you're done paying for extras you end up with the same price as is you paid for a better company where these "extras" are included. The website is done poorly, looks like it's done like that on purpose to make customers call their call centre with a fee of over 1 euro / minute, and they keep you on the phone. The seats are so tiny only children can fit comfortably (I'm petite and can hardly fit in the seats). And they are so uncomfortable my back is always stuck for days afterwards.

### "Not worth the cheap fares"
Krakow to Luton. This airline purposefully does not seat passengers together so that they are inclined to pay for seats together. Clunky app that causes difficulties with check in, they will then charge £40 to check in at the airport (as unable on the app). Not worth the cheap fares.

### "extra payment for everything"
Vienna to Oslo. They will add extra payment for everything, and hide this information well – and obviously speculate on this as a business model. I regret I spent my money here.

### "25 euros to pay for baggage?"
Dubai to Sofia. I made my boarding card online by my phone. At check in counter the ground officer  charge me 160AED for boarding card which i already did online. Trying to show him from my phone PDF but he refused and said company policy accept only printed paper not PDF. Onboard there is no  screen TV or facility. I ordered bottle of water 2.50 EURO, waiting more than 30 mints no one deliver the water. I ring the bell cabin crew brought the water and asked me to pay again. Return flight from Sofia to Dubai I made boarding card and printed, at check in they ask me 25 euros to pay for baggage? I asked why i have to pay I have small backbag less than 5/KG , he said its not by weight but size its by size.

### "not recommend this flight"
Luton to Tirana. I am shocked with the customer service. Going for department just before getting in the plain, we have to wait in stairs for round good 40 mins mind you with kids and family. I was very angry and to make this worse just before we were taking off, I asked to move seats because there were few seats empty. But I was not allowed. I would not recommend this flight to anyone.

### "The staff are so rude"
Budapest to Gatwick. I flew from Naples to Hungary to catch a flight to Gatwick. I had no issues from Naples to Hungary but as soon as I arrived to Hungary I was stung with two extra charges. The staff are so rude.

### "Staff was nice and friendly"
Luton to Prague. Delayed for about 30 minutes due to late arrival. A321-200 was almost new, interior clean, seats quite comfortable, but legroom too small. There wasn't any services for free, like other lowcost airlines. We arrived only about 10 minutes after scheduled arrival. Staff was nice and friendly.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  I had a flight one way flight booked from Budapest to Liverpool airport on the 07/01/20, the flight was booked for 2 passengers, the night prior my flight I included and paid for 2 priority bags for 10kg which cost me in total for 2 people £56, I paid this fee on the app and also checked in for us both, at arrival of our gate and waiting to board the flight I was told that the 10kg bag that had been added to our itinerary was not acceptable and I needed to pay another additional fee equivalent to £48. I am disgraced with the service I received and not only did they insist I paid this unnecessary fee but continued to put both of our bags in the overhead lockers anyway, I was dismissed when I expressed my dissatisfaction, and after what was supposed to be an enjoyable holiday and a nice return back home resulted in a disaster. I will never fly this airline again.

### "I was there 50 minutes before"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Istanbul. Worst experience ever! I can't even call it an experience since I had to move from different terminals in Lisbon, they never give you any information, they didn't let me check in online for some reason that no one  can explain, and finally arriving at the correct terminal - after having to pay over 20 euros for a 20kg bag online when purchasing the ticket - they simply were not there! They said they closed the check in 40 minutes before the flight, but I was there 50 minutes before and no one was there to check in me nor my bag. Lost the flight for no reason.

### "standard low cost service"
Luton to Athens. Pretty standard low cost service, where I had a small hand luggage allowance. Generally lenient with the policy. Crew had a smile,. I felt more welcome than with flights on Ryanair. Embarkation and disembarkation efficient. Both flights on time. Reasonable price (175EUR return - booked 6 days before departure). I got an emergency exit seat on one flight, without having paid for it.

### "There are many hidden costs"
Sofia to Tel Aviv with Wizz Air. Avoid this airline! There are many hidden costs. You are asked to pay for luggage and seats. They purposely split you up from anyone you are travelling with so that you pay to sit with them. You have to pay to take even the smallest bag on board. Even when we measured the dimensions of our bag to make sure it fit requirements, they still charged us extra. Just please avoid this horrible company! You end up paying more than the top airlines because of all this hidden charges. Soon they will charge for breathing air too!

### "Seats are uncomfortable"
Milan to Nur-Sultan via Budapest. It was worst flight I’ve ever had! Seats are uncomfortable! Staff is a little bit rude. In one flight (5 hours) they sold food on food trolley for 5 times + they sold perfume and cosmetics twice. It was inconvenient because the trolley blocked the pass! The flight arrived late, however there wasn’t any weather problem! Online check-in closed 3,5 hours before, however, in their site it’s written that online check-in closed only 2 hours before. They made automatically check-in and gave my husband 7B and to me 14D, even so, there were lots of free seats. And flight crew didn’t permit to change our seats. There were a problem with luggage too - we had to pay for our hand luggage even so it wasn’t overweighted.

### "experience is to be avoided"
Krakow to Luton. Terrible experience. Boarded and made to wait for at least 20 minuets in the hall before the runway. The deliberate seat allocation away from your travel partners to make you spend more money results in people leaning over shouting, extra moving around to talk to them. The seats are most uncomfortable, with leather protruded seams sticking in to your bottom and are very narrow. Somehow the seats feel far more cramped than the likes of easyjet or Ryanair. Cabin temp was so hot. The whole experience is to be avoided if at all possible.

### "Terrible baggage allowance"
Not Verified |  Budapest to Gatwick. Terrible baggage allowance. Paid for a hold bag and had a small cabin bag approx 40cmx30cmx30cm but  this was too big so was charged €25. They are very strict and very blunt. In fact, they make Ryanair look positively generous!

### "Avoid this airline"
Luton to Krakow with Wizz Air. Avoid this airline. There are many hidden costs. You are asked to pay for luggage and seats. They purposely split you up from anyone you are travelling with so that you pay to sit with them. You have to pay to take even the smallest bag on board. Even when we measured the dimensions of our bag to make sure it fit requirements, they still charged us extra. Avoid. You end up paying more than the top airlines because of all the hidden charges.

### "pay extra for baggage"
Budapest to Hannover. I bought a cheaper basic economy ticket to entitled for free carry on, but in the departure my bag was not allowed and I had to pay extra for baggage despite being ok with MAX 10 KG and fit under seat in front of me. I paid almost €40,00.

### "flights are inexpensive"
Budapest to Brussels Charleroi. Frequent Wizz customer. If you know your way around the system, the flights are inexpensive, cabin crew professional, and on the last flight the female captain gave very clear summary of our flight path, temperatures. Overall, a great experience.

### "made us pay 20 euro for hand luggage"
Sofia to Luton. Booked to fly to Bulgaria with Wizz Air when we came to check in we had to pay for our seats, no option to not pay or to check in when arrive at airport. We flew out no problem with our hand luggage and then in the way back they made us pay 20 euro for our hand luggage which was exactly the same as on the way out. Adding on our sports bag was also a lot more expensive than other airlines. Seems like a cheap flight when you first book before all the added extras. Then ended up waiting 50 minutes for board bag when arriving back to the UK

### "What a joke airline"
Budapest to Liverpool. What a joke airline. Deliberately split family up so all 4 of us including children were spaced all over the aeroplane. We had to pay extra to bring us all back together. Pay extra for baggage and then state bags too big despite being ok on the way out. Cheaper to fly with a proper airline. Won’t use again and recommend anyone thinks twice about using unless travelling on their own and with little if any baggage.

### "doesn’t include seat or luggage"
Budapest to Târgu Mureș booked for January 2020. They promote themselves as a cheap airline with an initial low fare, which doesn’t include seat or luggage. By the time you purchase the essential services it costs you the same as any other airline.

### "encounter a 3 hour delay"
Luton to Olsztyn Mazury. Overall flight experience was acceptable. However, I did encounter a 3 hour delay. Scheduled departure 16:25 actual departure 19:20. We had to sit at the airport for 5 hours, as we arrived 2 hours early before scheduled departure.

### "avoid at all costs"
Bergen to Luton. Useless airline, avoid at all costs. Our flight was cancelled after a 5 hour delay. Due to this, we lost a £800 holiday, with no compensation offered. Doesn’t even deserve one star

### "very narrow choice of luggage"
Luton to Moscow-Vnukovo The service is superb. The negatives are, that very narrow choice of luggage: either you fly only with a small bag, either you fly with a small bag, cabin suitcase and a checked-in luggage. There is no option between. There is no boarding pass for phone and you need to check-in at the airport only.

### "sit in the exit row"
Catania to Budapest. Some days before the flight I was invited to leave luggage at the desk (if you have chosen not to bring the classic cabin baggage). A321 neo, seat 17c is comfortable with good legspace. The flight attendant invites me to sit in the exit row where there is extra space. I bought an excellent tea, staff appear highly trained and prepared. Landing in Budapest and average baggage claim.

### "Never again Wizz Air!"
Luton to Warsaw. Absolutely shocking check-in experience on 20 December from Luton to Warsaw. Spent well over an hour in a priority queue to drop off my suitcase. They did not have enough staff to process everyone on time. They had to pick up people “at risk of missing flights” into a separate queue- to Warsaw about 50 people needed to be processed immediately. I arrived at the airport nearly 3 hours before departure and nearly missed my flight because of the very poor service at the check in. Never again Wizz Air!

### "cancelled on the night of departure"
Sofia to Catania. The cost of the tickets (both outbound and return for two passengers) was 260eur. The flight was cancelled on the night of departure. We were told that wizzair will give us a compensation of total 400eur per passenger. After the cancelation, we booked another flight to our destination that was 180eur in total. We were paid only refund of 25eur per both passengers. The staff was very rude when we contacted them telling us that if we are not satisfied with our 25eur, we can contact a lawyer ironically said. We have lost a bunch of extra money for nothing, lost 2 night in Sofia and our vacation was ruined.

### "35 euro for check in at airport"
Oslo to Budapest. They Charge 35 euro for check in at airport. On the top of that if you have a bag bigger than normal, you have to pay extra 16 euro. I bought fly ticket worth 1400 norwegian kroner But had to pay 1400 norwegian kroner extra for check in and cabin bags. The most unfortunate thing is i have four more tickets of Wizz air yet to travel. Hope they will not charge for using toilet in board.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton to Lisbon. The worst airline I ever purchased a flight from. They made all the buying process as confusing as it could be .. while I thought i was paying 2 tickets for 480£ i realised by the end that this price was for 1 person with no bag and I had to purchase a bag. My husband had to buy another ticket, and just 10 min after the flight was 300£, no bag again! It is unbelievable to pay this amount for such short journey and the way the website is designed is for you to fall for a mistake and pay some more. Like when they ask you to do the check in online for not paying extra fee. I paid extra 50£ both ways to have 10kg bag. I am here in a endless queue, late for my flight and they say there is no enough staff to make the flight.

### "the flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  Luton to Cluj-Napoca. After seven hours to wait at the airport the flight was cancelled. The reason? After this we should to wait 3 days more to go at the destination. No way.

### "No issues during the flight"
Copenhagen to Kutaisi with Wizz Air. Once on the plane, the flight was smooth. The cabin staff was friendly. On an aisle seat, there was enough legroom and space to sleep comfortably with a decent pillow. The flight was pretty quiet as well and the landing was extremely smooth. Now before boarding is another matter. It started a bit late, however, the issue was that after passing the gate the exit was blocked - plane hadn't arrived yet. Which resulted in almost all passengers being lumped together in a few square meters of space. It got extremely hot, and a few people weren't feeling well. This was also somewhat bad because it is the flu season. This lasted for around 15 minutes. After that, the plane came and the boarding proceeded normally. No issues during the flight as mentioned. I didn't have any checked luggage so I didn't have to interact with other services.

### "refused to pay the amount"
Luton to Tel Aviv. Unfortunately due to passenger illness on the inbound flight our flight was delayed 12 hours and having been promised the cost of a taxi to return to our apartment and returning to the airport, Wizz Air refused to pay the amount - dreadful service

### "just said we were late"
Vienna to Tel Aviv. This morning we got to the airport 2.5 hours before our flight. The check in took almost an hour and we got to the gate at the last minute. My daughter walked in front of us and got to the gate around 1.5 minutes before us and when we arrived the attendant close the gate and didn't give us to get on flight. We saw our daughter on the bus and explained the situation but she just told us that the gate is closed and we missed the flight. After few minutes we found out that there are more passengers that didn't make it. The flight was delayed because they took off the suitcases. We tried to talk to the supervisor but he didn't care and told us that they already gave our seats. I begged him to help us but they just said we were late. There is no representative of wizz air in the airport to help the customer! They don't care of their customers.

### "£35 a person to check in"
Had a very poor experience travelling with Wizz air. When travelling back from Budapest to Luton I was unable to check in via the app. It would only allow me to check in after paying for seats. I tried to ring Wizz air to which I had no answer. So decided to check in when I arrived at the airport. When doing so I was to that I would have to pay £35 a person to check in. I tried to explain my situation but was told I had no choice or I wouldn’t fly. One representative said they make the button so small On there website that it falls a lot of people When trying to check in online without paying for seats. I emailed the complaint line to explain and try and get my money back also mentioning that I have dyslexia so struggle at the best of times. I was only then sent back a reply which read completely automated. Will now do my best to not travel with Wizz air and can only stress to others flying to try using someone else also if possible.

### "the last and final time"
Kraków to Luton. Booked a holiday via last minute. Flew in on Easyjet, no problems, no proper check in, no ridiculous bag weigh restrictions. Arrived at airport to depart, as we hadn’t don’t an electronic check in 3 hours prior to arrival ..... even though we have a bagged to check in, we get charged. We flew in with 15kg allowance and they only fly a 10kg allowance. We get charged. Seats were dirty. Customer service were sarcastic. Food was way over priced. I have only ever flown with them once and that is the last and final time. Considering their prices there are far more superior airlines for cheaper prices.

### "waiting for a technician"
Stavanger to Luton. Just boarded a Wizz Air plane only to be immediately off boarded. The ground crew have said there is a technical issue while someone onboard said that smoke had been seen coming from the rear of the aircraft. Update to follow. At 35 minutes past takeoff time, I have been told that Wizz Air does not have its own technicians at this airport, so and we are waiting for a technician from another airline to become free to investigate the problem.

### "They overcharge everything"
Worst airline ever. They overcharge everything. The ticket was about 90 euros (with return) but with their schemes and plots it costed me 165. I paid for my luggage online and minutes before the flight an extremely rude employee said that I had to pay an extra 25 euros for an already checked in luggage. Will never fly again.

### "never heard of Customer Service"
Budapest to Luton on 4th December and although the flight was delayed by over an hour late into the evening (10.15pm), when we boarded the cabin crew were really helpful and friendly. Myself and my partner had not paid extra to reserve a seat but there were many seats left empty and unbooked. I asked if it would be ok to swap seats and sit next to my partner in a couple of the empty seats. These seats had extra leg space by the emergency exit but we were just happy to sit together, using the empty seats. The stewardess was really helpful when asked if it was ok to sit together in the empty seats. Then we travelled back 3 days later and found that the flight was on time and it was almost as though we were flying with a different Airline. Exactly the same situation occurred, many empty seats. We asked the same question to the Stewardess "Flora". She was so rude that I was shocked at how someone could be so rude in public whilst working for a company that prides itself on having repeat customers and giving good service. She offered the wide leg space seats for 15 Euros per seat. She said she just follows Wizz Air policy. We asked "How can Wizz Air policy be valid in one direction but not the other?. She didnt answer our question. She then said we can sit next to each other but not with the extra leg room. Then we started searching for other seats and she made no attempt to offer us any help at all. Others customers who were embarrassed by her behaviour offered us their help. Has this woman never heard of Customer Service. I had thought this was a service business. The seats could not have been sold as we were already in the air. This Stewardess was an embarrassment to Wizz Air. She attempted to publicly embarrass us both for asking the question and so many other customers could see this and offered us help themselves. The way that she spoke to us was Wrong. We had 3 separate sets of customers who stated that this was completely unreasonable and a very bad way for Wizz Air to behave. I have a Wizz Air discount and wonder if I should ever bother to come back again.

### "I do not recommend"
Luton to Poprad. I do not recommend to use this company. Yes, their tickets are cheap, however they create complexity of rules and non-standard procedures to pull out more money from you. In addition to that, the service level we received at the Luton airport at the customer service desk was rude.

### "had extra legroom seat"
Budapest to Doncaster. Checkin was quite easy, Priority wAS quick. Boarding started on time and flight took off only 5 min after scheduled, landed 20 min early in Doncaster. Staff was nice, I had extra legroom seat, which is big for legs, but not wider than other seats. Plane was almost fully booked. Food and beverage range is new, and duty free products are worth to buy. No hot meal available unfortunately.

### "staff friendly and smiley"
Doncaster to Budapest. Check-in opened 2.5 hours before departure, so I could early drop off my bag, and spend more time in duty-free shopping. Boarding started a bit late but the staff was friendly and smiley. I am tall but I find this seat comfortable. Onboard prices could be cheaper, no hot meal, unfortunately. If you book early you can get really cheap tickets.

### "I was charged excess baggage"
Frankfurt Hahn to Lviv. When I bought my tickets online a Wizz Club was offered for a fee. I did not check the box that I wanted that club and it didn't show up on my bill before I hit purchase. Then I was charged for it. Tried to contact Wizz to get my money back. No one would help me. I never intend on flying Wizz again. Was treated horribly by Wizz staff in Lviv. I was charged excess baggage in Lviv for a bag that was fine to fly from Frankfurt with at no extra charge. It's theft and extortion. Flights attendants from Lviv were rude. Ground crew spotted throwing bags around. The food on board is expensive and tastes horrible.

### "I would fly with them again"
Gatwick to Budapest. Genuinely had a pleasant experience with this airline - flight out was 30 minutes late but was given plenty of warning (5 hours before departure) so just left home a little later. No issues about carry on luggage (my bag was within the accepted allowance 40x30x20 but many others had larger bags than mine and there was no complaints from staff that I noticed) and after the delay we were boarded and took off with no further issues. The cabin crew were very pleasant and attentive. Admittedly the seats were not the most comfortable I have experienced but they certainly were not awful and I was able to comfortably enjoy my flight. Leg room is limited however, if you have larger legs it would be advisable to pick a seat with more leg room. I made sure I checked in online and printed off my boarding pass after reading other reviews and therefore there was no problems with this. It is not a luxury airline but you get what you pay for. Just ensure you check in online and print off your boarding pass. I would fly with them again.

### "they charge baggage fees"
Gatwick to Bucharest. Be careful, they charge baggage fees at the airport. Although I had a boarding pass and had checked in online, I was still charged $50 USD by the staff for oversize baggage fee . When I asked why I was told to call customer service. Wizz Air customer service charges to call their call center! Worst flight I have ever had.

### "never fly with Wizz Air again"
Iasi to Tel Aviv. This is not a low cost when company looking for excuses to take more money and when the “fines for small stuff like not booking online is higher then the flight ticket. I used Wizz Air as a connection flight from Munich because it was the cheapest. I am very sorry for that and i regret, i paid much more then i was paying for the direct flight. they leave you with no other option then to pay 50 euros more. I fly a lot with low costs, but Wizz Aair demands are sound more like a game of “lets wait until you do a mistake and charge you for unproportional amount” I will never fly with Wizz Air again.

### "crazy expensive and stupid"
Budapest to Doncaster Sheffield with Wizz Air. I was unable to check in online 3 hours before departure so I had to pay a 35€ fee at the airport. It's crazy expensive and stupid, because I had no baggage to check in, only a small bag. Ridiculous, they make you pay for every little mistake you make. With other airlines I was able to check in online 1.5 hours before departure.

### "charged for registration fee"
Kiev to Luton. Wizz Air changed the airport of my flight back from Kyiv, from Julyany to Boryspil, since then I was not able to register online, because site was not accepting my registration, I also was trying to register in app and the same result. When I booked the tickets (before flight to Ukraine) I've booked the seats for myself and all my family (wife and three children), and they've been lost when the flight was changed to Kiev. Apart of that, I've been charged by airport for registration fee, in total 157.79 GBP. I claimed that to Wizz Air but they've rejected my claim. Never use this company, poor service, no response for month, no resolving any issues, no refunds, no compensation at all for any fault from their end, and to be honest the price is not for low cost.

### "I don't recommend this company"
Definitely the worst experience I ever had. I was traveling from Barcelona to Thessaloniki via Budapest. In Barcelona they informed me that I had to pay 25€ extra for my hand-luggage ( despite the fact that a 10kg luggage was included in the original price). As they told me, I was carrying a "trolley-luggage" and I should pay more money for that, because that company doesn't consider all hand-luggage as carry-on bags. Since I booked the tickets through another site this detail wasn't clear enough. I was looking for someone to talk to, in order to find a solution and there was no person or office in the airport to whom I could to talk with. The site which booked my ticket told me to get out of the airport and get back again passing the check, in order to find an office. Unfortunately, that was not possible since I had not enough time. Not only, I paid once in Barcelona, but they also asked me to pay second time to Budapest. As a result I ran out of money and I left my luggage back at the airport. Both, the lack of staff and the policy of this airline made me feel really uncomfortable and upset. So after all I don't recommend this company.

### "only allowed a tiny rucksack"
The worst experience I have had on a budget airline. The seats seam to have amazingly even less legroom than what you would find on the likes of EasyJet. What is worst however is that you have to pay for priority boarding to even get a carry on suitcase (for free apparently). Without priority you are only allowed a tiny rucksack. They failed to tell me this heading out and then made me pay €25 pp coming back home just to get the carry on luggage on board!

### "Very poor ground service"
Gatwick to Budapest. Very poor ground service; flight delayed by 1h due to “unaware of special assistance passenger requirements”. Further, ground service personnel did not know how to properly use the tannoy system. The boarding process was very disorganised - the announcement was unclear about who was to board first. My wife and I were split up by many rows despite there being ample room for us to sit together on the flight and checking in at the same time on the same booking - unsavoury business practice offering inconvenience as a default for no good reason other than trying to get passengers to pay extra to select seats. Overall cheap flight - we got what we paid for - basic improvements would go a long way.

### "disappointed about staff"
Not Verified |  Our flight was from Palanga to Luton. We have got message that our flight delayed. So we came with our 20kg suitcase, like normally before our flight (by the time what they changed). Check in was closed, we asked to check in our suitcase and they said, that they done that by previous flight time. We asked what we can do, they said 'your suitcase is to big to go to the plane, like cabin bag. Check in is closed, you needed to bring it by old flight time. Now it's imposible to check in, cause then flight will be delayed 20min more, just because of you.'. We tried to sort it out and the staff from few metres been shouting 'so what are you doing? Flying or not?'. The staff was very rude and unprofessional! So we must call for brother and leave our 20kg suitcase for him. And even after we went by the gates, we been still been waiting 30min, they just been putting all suitcases to the plane. And we been really disappointed about staff. They're so rude!

### "said I missed my flight"
Luton to Iasi. Unhelpful, confusing and rude staff After checking in online I closed by mistake the window where I could download or print the boarding pass and when I opened it again it was gone so I couldn't print it out myself. I tried to print it at the airport, the staff said they would print it for me at the check in but when I got there they said I missed my flight after 30 min of waiting in line. Staff tell me I can book another flight for 77 pounds more. I ask them about the travel insurance I paid for and they tell me it's a third party company. I call Wizz Air by their contact number and they give me the wrong number twice, good thing the insurance company sent me an email so I can speak with them.

### "Absolute shambles and zero respect for the customer"
Almost always late. I haven't used them in many years after my previous terrible experience with delays but was kind forced to do it again. It was manageable but as usual lots of hidden fees in a ticket purchase (admin fee for each flight for example despite purchasing it at once). But final straw was that I got charged 35 pounds for not doing check in online despite no reminders about having to do so. Turns out it's hidden deep between lots of writing. I complained about it. It took them 5 weeks (!) to answer to my email and literally just quote that bit to me. Absolute shambles and zero respect for the customer. Avoid Wizz Air like the plague.

### "An all over no good experience"
Brussels to BudapestBrussels to Budapest. For sure my last trip with Wizz Air. An all over "no good" experience. Its a shame that they can continue with treating people like this. In the early years it was really ok but the "shareholder" pressure is apparently too high to show some more respect for the customers. Pity. I wish them the worst. Cabin staff were ok! I have to say that. Maybe they should leave the company before it is to late.

### "Very rude staff"
Not Verified | St Petersburg to Luton. The worst airline company ever. They are tricking you with cheap tickets to charge you later for everything. We had to pay 90€ for check-in after I did it online, and the "best ever system" give me the pass boards for the 2 days ago fly, how come that is possible, to do the check-in for the previous flight? Very rude staff and flight delayed. Never recommend it

### "charged me 35 euros to check in"
Budapest to Rome. Terrible experience. They charged me 35 euros to check in, even after I paid for a mobile boarding pass and my friend paid extra for priority. They didn’t waive the 35 euro fee. This is quite possibly the worst airline I’ve ever flown. They also made us walk 5 minutes in the rain to get to our plane. They just are awful.

### "worst trip we ever had"
Berlin to Budapest. It was the worst trip we ever had. Flights were late, service very bad, the space between the seats is even for a budget-airline to small, online-check-in doesn't work and for the counter-check-in we had to pay EUR 71,39 extra! Never Wizz air again.

### "overall bad service"
Budapest to Gatwick. Absolutely rubbish airline. Very unclear luggage allowance, we were told no wheel bags allowed and everyone who had one was charged £24, even if within the regulation sizes. I read the confirmation with luggage sizes and thought I had adhered to them. Steer clear, sat on the tarmac for nearly 2 hours waiting for people to pay the additional charges for their luggage. Very annoying and overall bad service. Rude staff and awful service.

### "Horrible booking process"
Not Verified |  Belgrade to Paris. Horrible booking process, filled with traps designed to get the customer to sign up for unnecessary services. Check in process designed to trap the customer into paying high airport checkin charges. Dont use this scam of an airline.

### "5 sandwiches for 200 passengers"
Not Verified | Tel Aviv to Luton. Flight over was OK but coming back only one trolley service on a five and a half hour flight, only 5 sandwiches for nearly 200 passengers and no toilet paper in the rear toilet. Not good enough and will not fly with them again. It was the Sabbath when we left Tel Aviv so not much open in the terminal, airline must have known this so why didn't they ensure sufficient food on board. Went 8 hours with crisps and a chocolate bar including the time at the terminal.

### "everything went as it was meant to be"
Turku to Skopje. We were traveling as a family with teenage children. I must say that everything went as it was meant to be. Flight on time, FA professional and helpful. Clean airplane. Only that was negative was that only three of us could sit together, but we didn't pay extra to be able choose seats. Check-in/Baggage drop in Turku was a bit slow. Mainly due to the fact that there were only two check-in-desks (and one of them for "Priority" customers). What surprised me was that many passengers hadn´t checked in online. These needed of course to pay extra for check-in, and each and everyone of these passengers made "us others" wait longer. Must say that we, as inexperienced travelers (only 1-2-return trips/year) have not had any problems with any "low-cost-airlines". But we try to be careful doing our homework so no unpleasant surprises will occur.

### "their prices are so good"
Luton to Prishtina. I’ve flown Wizz Air many times and will continue to do so. As their prices are so good. But normally you do find they are delayed and it’s a rushed process. However this time, as we flew out at 5.55am the plane was already here meaning boarding was smooth, quick and efficient. By being on the first flights out also meant there was no traffic on the running. Meaning we landed 45 mins early in Prishtina. Definitely the best flight I’ve ever had with Wizz.

### "made me pay for hand language"
Oslo to Luton. They made me pay for hand language. Very noisy plane. This is the First and last time I will travel using Wizz air.

### "make us pay in the airport"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Luton. Bought 2 priority tickets online. But still they make us pay in the airport. Staff very rude, very bad service, what they say in the site is not true. They charge money for no reason. Very bad flight and service.

### "pay extra cost for the baggage"
I bought 4 tickets from Eindhoven to Sofia return. I traveled with my daughter and I paid full amount ticket and paid extra cost 2 seaters, Wizz priority and I paid also extra Wizz club because mentioned in the website if I bought then give me special price every time I fly with Wizz Air. I brought 1 cabin baggage and 1 small school bag which inside there were kid lunch box and child cloth. The incident began while I arrived at Eindhoven Airport where staff said that I should pay extra cost for the baggage, I asked her why because I paid 2 full amount ticket, I paid for 2 seaters, I paid for priority passenger and even I paid extra for Wizz Club Card. I argued with her but she denied me to board if I did not pay 25 euro extra. I did not have any option beside to paid 25 euro extra otherwise again they wont let me on the board. While I fly back on 10 October 2019 from Sofia to Eindhoven I did not have some problem even I brought exactly same back as I left before from Eindhoven. After arrived In Nederland, I submitted complain via Wizz Air Website,I took so long to got reaction of my complain as they said must investigate the case. After took so long, they said that I broke the rule term and baggage condition that why extra fee applied but how come I broke the rule?

### "They just don't care"
Vienna to Malta. So, if you want to use the basic fare, you can't take a trolley, even if it was in the size limits (but not always). They just don't care. When I complained to them they tried to blame the airport - no the airport was ok, they were the one that decided that I baggage with wheels is different than a backpack with the same size, or even a bigger one. Hope they are happy with the 45 euro they stole from me. I will avoid flying with them at all costs.

### "Don’t waste your time and money"
Poznan to Luton. The worst experience ever. Wizzair is never on time and more expensive than regular airline. My bag was damaged and the customer service was closed at the airport so they wanted me to come back to the airport to report it. And go to the repair shop then! I don’t know any repair shop for damaged luggage. Don’t waste your time and money with Wizzair.

### "£35 to check-in at airport"
Luton to Gdansk. By far the worst airline I have flown with. The customer service is just terrible. Required to pay £35 to check-in at the airport - just crazy!

### "can’t refund the amount paid"
Not Verified |  Porto to Luton. I paid an extra for fee for services that Wizz Air calls "Wizz Priority" and which they state includes: "PRIORITY CHECK-IN, dedicated check-in desk to drop your luggage faster" and "precedence when boarding the aircraft - you will also be called first for boarding. I paid for those services for 4 tickets: myself, my wife, my two daughters. We did not receive that service. On check-in the "PRIORITY CHECK-IN" line did not get priority. It was actually 3 times longer than the check in line for passengers that did not pay for Wizz Priority. We got lowered priority. This was because Wizz had twice as many check-in staff attending to non-priority customers as priority customers, even though there were more priority customers in line. At the gate, there was no priority in boarding. Everyone was called to board at the same time. We were not called first for boarding and received no precedence. I complained in person, and in writing. Here is Wizz Air's response: "We are sorry to hear about this unfortunate situation and would like to assure you that we are doing our best to handle all customer inquiries in a timely manner. With regards to your request, we regret to inform that we can’t refund the amount paid for Wizz Priority because it is considered non-refundable. It is unfortunate that we cannot do anything more due to our policies.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Liverpool to Bucharest. Wizz Air lost my checked luggage on the 27th September. I was left in Bucharest for 3 days with no belongings - I had to buy emergency clothes/toiletries etc and Wizz Air have not given me any compensation - turns out if they did, it would only be for 50% of the value of the items I bought! It has now been 21 days and despite submitting evidence such as boarding passes, receipts and proof of delay/loss I have not received any kind of compensation or email reply from Wizz Air. It is unbelievable that they have lost a considerable amount of my personal belongings, charged me £30 extra each way to check in luggage and have left me out of pocket for a mistake they have made in losing my bag. The only way to contact them on the phone costs £1.45 per minute - yet more expense and money I will have to fork out to get them to fix their error. Do not fly with this airline - I am surprised they are allowed to operate and hopefully they will not be operating for much longer!

### "should arrange to have a lift"
Not Verified |  Me my 2 year old daughter were travelling to Budapest from Luton. It’s unacceptable the fact that there was no lift from the airport building to the plane gate and I had to carry my luggage, my daughter’s luggage, the push chair and my daughter around 200 steps down the stairs to the gate. What if my daughter fell from my hands and hurt herself? What if we both fell from the stairs. Whoever is checking this you should arrange the next Wizz air flight to have a lift along the route and allow people to get to the gates on the safest possible way!

### "They are a rip-off"
Not Verified |  Tirana to London with Wizz Air. Avoid at all cost! They are a rip-off. I only travelled with them for the first time yesterday and would never ever fly with them again. Went in to do the check in for the whole family, 4 of us. It would only allow my check in and denied the check in for the rest. Since their customer service number is a rip-off itself, we decided to go to the airport and talk to them face to face. The only thing they were saying and wanted was that, you need to pay, pay and pay, if you want us to do your check in. I tried to explain that I could do it myself but they have denied my right to do it online. Nope. They wont get it. They did the same or similar to many others on the plane. Also my sister did the check in online but they did not gave her a bar code, making her paying £20 just to get her bar code at the airport.

### "very impressed with the cabin staff"
I flew Wizz Air for the first time, a short break to Oslo. The outbound flight was about 1h late due to a technical problem, we originally left on time and taxiing to the runway the captain found a fault so we returned to the gate. I was surprised they were not over zealous regarding cabin baggage size at Luton. I only had a small bag but I noticed others with slightly larger bags not being challenged. The return from Oslo 2 days later, the flight was on time and the gate staff at Oslo were strict with the size of cabin baggage. I actually agree with this as others pay in advance for a trolley in the cabin so why should others with big rucksacks get away with it? The return flight was on time and I was really very impressed with the cabin staff on that flight! The 2 ladies serving the front cabin were charming, professional and very well groomed.

### "Absolutely disgusting"
Luton to Krakow. Denied Boarding! Absolutely disgusting - myself and partner were going away for a long weekend for my 40th but on arrival of the check in desk in Luton Airport was told that the flight had been overbooked and we had been downgraded to standby tickets. I was then offered a seat at the gate (not my partner) and was told by the dispatcher that the next flight was in 12 hours but it was also overbooked - I clearly declined this. We were then escorted back to the departure gate an hour later to speak to a customer service rep who informed me that I was only able to claim €100 compensation (rather than €250) as I declined to travel separately! So we lost a whole day of the 3 day trip, had to travel to Gatwick for an alternative flight which we had to book and pay for ourselves, including the travel through there greed. On top of this the customer service reps were rude and unhelpful. I will never use them again.

### "I got denied boarding"
Not Verified |  Otopeni to Bergamo. I got denied boarding, without even scanning my ticket! I was about to board the plane when an employee stops me and tells that I will have to pay my carry-on 25€. I answer that I’ve already paid for this luggage as proved on my ticket. She refuses to listen to me and tells me that my luggage doesn’t fit into the hand luggage measures that goes under the seat. Of course, I paid for my carry-on that goes in the overhead compartment and it fully corresponds to the measures and weight of Wizz Air policy and which was previously accepted on my inbound flight. I am told since I did not leave my luggage at check-in, the supplement is inevitable, so I agree to pay. I am directed to a second employee and now she is ordering me to put my purse in my carry on otherwise she will charge me 60€! I am shocked because this second extra is totally unjustified. I then ask for explanations for these fees, her rude answer: If you refuse to pay, a stand-by will be happy to take your place! I say a second time that I do not refuse to pay the 60€, but I wish explanations why I should 1) Pay my carry-on a 2nd time 2) Pay my little purse which is clearly indicated as free on your website. To this question, the employee impolitely responds: You will not board the plane, I give your ticket to someone else. Without raising the tone on my part, I beg her to let me in, I was ready to pay 60€ and look for explanations later but it was too late, and the employee had let the stand by take my place and closed the gate on me and another customer without any valid explanation. This second customer was even more poorly threatened even though she was grieving her sister that had just passed away. This employee refused to identify herself, it's been two months and still no refund or even an apology from Wizz Air! I still can't believe those kind of actions are left without any consequences!

### "incompetence and disorganisation at every stage"
Not Verified |  Truly shocked by how horrible and stressful the Wizz Air experience was. 1) Check-in queue was 1 hour long and chaotic because they were inefficient and disorganised. 2) After we queued for 1 hour, they told us we had to pay a €35 fine because we "should have checked in online". Nowhere in the online booking process or emails was this made clear. In fact the opposite. It appears to be an intentional extortion technique. 3) We were told to leave the queue, pay the fine, and then queue all over again, even if it meant missing our flight. And that there was no other option. 4) The young girl on the check-in counter was incredibly rude and obnoxious, treating us like petty criminals. 5) When we finally got back to a check-in counter after paying the fine and re-queuing, another young girl forgot to print out our boarding passes before sending us on our way. Oh yeah, I forgot" she said, when we asked "shouldn't we have boarding passes?". Pathetic. Even if you argue that we should have checked in online (we didn't because we'd already paid extra for our seats so assumed we could simply check in at the airport, as standard, since it absolutely was not made clear), the size of the penalty (€35 each) is extortionate, it was vindictive and cruel to make us queue all over again after a 1 hour wait, their spiteful attitude was horrible, and they displayed incompetence and disorganisation at every stage. Truly awful, unethical, disorganised, incompetent. I strongly urge you to avoid them at all costs.

### "Do not use Wizz Air!"
Reykjavík to Luton. Do not use Wizz Air! If you don’t check in online 3 hours before your flight, 35euro extra. If you have a hard bag any larger than essentially a handbag, 30euro extra. If you don’t pay the additional 30euro, then you’ll get allocated random seats so you’re separated from who you’re flying with. Late flight because they’re understaffed checking in luggage and when boarding, staff also unfriendly. Wish I’d flown with another airline because it would’ve been a better experience and would’ve ultimately been cheaper.

### "a horrible experience"
Cluj Napoca to Luton with Wizz Air. It is a horrible experience to find out at the check-in desk I was sold a so called "stand by ticket". They told me to go to the boarding gate and wait until everybody is on board then thay will tell me if i will get a seat or stay for the next flight. How can this happen to sell a non-existent ticket?

### "waited 1.5 hours for luggage."
Chisinau to Luton. There’s nothing “Wizz” about this airline. Checking on the way out was painfully slow (3/4 hour in a so-called priority queue) then - bizarrely - massive queues on a staircase waiting to board for another 3/4hr when we could have been sat in the departure lounge. But they saved the best til last: landing at Luton on the return leg, we waited 1.5 hours for luggage. Wizz saw fit to have no one on their information desk, and gave no communication. Eventually the bags appeared on a different belt but we had to find that out for ourselves. Meanwhile if you call customer services they charge a premium rate. My experiment with low cost airlines and especially this one is over and I’ll be back to LHR flights even if it means changing.

### "staff were very rude"
Not Verified | Lasi to Luton. Wizz Air staff were very rude to us. First of all, nobody told us that we need to check-in online for our flight. Usually, the check-in is at the airport. We had to pay 70£. People take care and check if you can do check-in online when you flying with them.

### "do not care in the slightest"
Budapest to London Luton with Wizz Air. The airline over booked my flight and I currently don’t know if I can board it with my partner. I can not see any reason they would do this apparent from pure greed! They obviously do not care in the slightest about their customers but only making money! Avoid this airline at all cost! On the inbound flight there was no air conditioning and it was too hot. Absolute rubbish. I shall never fly Wizz Air again!

### "Total disappointment"
Larnaca to Luton. Our flight started with an almost 1-hour delay, we got off in Luton only for them to tell us our luggage was left in Larnaca, completed some forms in the lost and found of the airport and told us in a couple of days they would be delivered to us. I called lost and found 10 times and they never answered, never. Imagine my frustration. I haven't been able to shower since my stuff and everything was in my bag, I can't study because my books are in my luggage and there is just no way of contacting them. I don't have enough money to be spending on extra stuff that I should have with me from the moment I got to the UK. Total disappointment. Never again. They sent us an email telling us to trace our luggage with a number we never got from the airport. Well done.

### "flight attendants were nice"
Milan to Bucharest. Cabin was clean, flight attendants were nice. The only thing i can complain about is the passengers that use this flight. They make your flight a nightmare, but it’s not Wizz Air’s fault

### "do not respond to my emails"
I was supposed to flight back from Cluj to Gatwick but they told me that my flight was overbooked so I was not allowed to board. They told me that the next Wizz Air flight I could take free of charge would be 5 days later and if I could not wait 5 days, it was my responsibility to book another flight. I had to spend £635 to buy a new ticket to come back home on time. They told me that I would receive £400 compensation. One month later and I have not received anything. They do not respond to my emails nor my calls.

### "very vague and misleading"
Not Verified |  I was not able to check in online for my flight nor did I get an email about my flight. My Wizz account said that I had no upcoming flights but I was still charged almost $40 to check in at the airport. I emailed them about it after and they told me I should have called them about the issue before I got to the airport. I was traveling internationally and the rates for such calls are astronomical. Despite their website glitch they told me that the amount was non refundable. They also sent me the ‘fine print’ they send every customer which is very vague and misleading. You might as well use a real airline if you’re going to pay the same amount when they make mistakes. Also, the plane is definitely one owned by a budget airplane. It’s worn out and needed new carpet.

### "wizzed my money away"
Not Verified |  Luton to Athens. Flew to Athens with this carrier and the outbound journey was ok. About 72-48 hours prior to my flight home I tried to check in online but the website stated that online check in was not available, no problem thought checking in at the airport would be fine, boy was I wrong. Got to the airport in plenty of time, and was told we couldn’t check in until we paid 70 Euro for 2 of us. We were told to keep receipts and we could claim our money back via their website on our return home. Tried to do just this but were told no. I urge you if you want to hold onto your hard earned money then try another carrier. They certainly wizzed my money away.

### "flights were delayed and allocated random seats"
Birmingham to Budapest. I would heavily recommend against Wizz Air. A terrible airline that because of its cheap prices seems like a stable choice to fly with. Both of my flights were delayed and allocated random seats, the plane on the way there was dirty having gum on the table and a grubby back chair in front. On the way back from our holiday we were told we had to pay a premium to fly home as our bags were too big for carry on. We explained we had already flown here by the same airline with the same bags and they forced us to pay 50 euros upfront. We went through to the gate to find no other passengers had paid for 'Wizz Priority' and we had paid for no reason. We also had our flight delayed by 1hr 50mins and then there was no priority boarding and it was a scrum to get onto the plane. What a terrible end to our holiday, I have since contacted customer services who less than care and are of no help. Avoid at all costs, pay the extra money to fly with a reputable airline that wont try to scam you.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Larnaca to Luton with Wizz Air. Avoid at all costs. Charged €25 for a small cabin bag at the gate. Cash only and no change available from the ground staffs wallet! Departure 1.30 hrs late, not cleaned and surly cabin crew. I thought I had reached aviation rock bottom with Ryanair, but Wizz make them look like Singapore! Never again. Date of travel: September 2019.

### "Good price/quality ratio"
Good price/quality ratio. Departed on time, arrived on time, sort-of friendly crew. My (limited) expectations, which were in line with the cost of the flight, were met.

### "a horrible company"
Milan to Vienna. Just a horrible company. Bugs during online check in, terrible service, messed up boarding (they don’t really care if you priority or not, everyone go on the same bus), etc.

### "a obvious lack of communication"
Riga to London Luton. We can understand delays, problems happen but we cannot certainly tolerate customer abuse. I found it insulting after an 8 hour delay being given vouchers of 4 euros for "refreshments" and knowing that a simple sandwich cost double than that. Also there was a obvious lack of communication with the passengers, no even providing assistance on calls and help people with needs. For me was an awful experience and I will try to avoid Wizz Air on the future.

### "check in charged 35€!"
Reykjavik to Luton. Ridiculous scam. They did not write anywhere visible that check in at the airport was charged 35€! We a single reservation for 4 people and we were forced to pay 140€ just because we did not do the check in online. And we had to send luggages anyway. Really shameful company.

### "Terribly disorganised"
Keflavik to Luton. Terribly disorganised, for no apparent reason, claimed we could not take our travel size carry on when the tickets clearly stated we could. Staff do not know what they are doing. Delayed both journeys due to incompetent staff.

### "denied me boarding"
Katowice to Santander. Used them from time to time without any issues and i thought it would never happen to me but this is one of airlines that sooner or later will make you feel sorry for using it. Being aware of changes in their luggage policy i have purchased hand luggage allowance (a cabin one, free in all normal airlines) but when got to boarding i discovered in a hard way what does it mean when Wizz Air have one of his customer pillaging days, I was told that my luggage should be checked in and it is closed now so I have to pay or won't fly, great, after expressing disagreement and calling that a robbery I paid but staff felt offended and wanted me apologize and decided it was not honest and denied me boarding my wife and daughter. , Perhaps I was accustomed to the excellent treatment you get in mainstream airlines and made and error risking flight to some murky secondary airports with well known for customer abuse airline I hope it will serve you as a warning.

### "What a rip-off!"
Tallinn to Luton. Typical budget airline ripping off their customers. When I booked the tickets, WizzAir had a note saying that if not checked in online the charge at the airport would be €10. We missed the 3 hours cut-off time and they made us pay €74 for 2 people! What happened to €10 per person? You have to have a disclaimer for your customers to let them know prices. What a rip-off! The agents could care less and were pretty rude saying we had no choice but to pay or miss the flight.

### "incompetent and inadequate"
Budapest to Basel. It was not surprise that again I realized it was a big mistake to use Wizzair (just dates for the flight were convenient). If I accumulate the time I was waiting for boarding for all my flights with other companies this it will be less compared to the time for 1 flight with wizzair. Somehow in this poor excuse of a company they succeed to have the most incompetent and inadequate people at all levels!

### "excellent no-frills budget airline"
Luton - Skopje - Budapest - Luton. Wizz Air is an excellent no-frills budget airline. Flights for all sectors were on time. Boarding was efficient and good to see that Wizz Air staff ensure that priority passengers are actually given priority in boarding. Cabin crew were business-like and pleasant. Announcements from the flight deck were audible and informative. Wizz Air sent useful SMS the day prior to the flight home advising of possible air-traffic delays (which did not materialise). Most of the low marks awarded to Wizz Air on Skytrax appear to be attributable to the fact that customers do not (or can not) read the terms and conditions (T&C) attaching to the tickets. Read and understand the T&C and Wizz Air provides excellent value and service.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton to Athens. They have strange baggage policy which is never clarified! I needed 1 luggage of 32kg and 1 luggage of 20kg. On their website, they have a misleading clarification: Checked in baggage 'You can check in up to 3 pieces of checked-in luggage. Wizz Air is introducing a new type of checked-in bag with a weight allowance of 10 kg, besides the available 20 and 32 kg options.You can check in a maximum 1 bag of 10 kg, 2 bags of 20 kg, or 3 bags of 32 kg. Other combination of checked-in bags is not possible to purchase online. My understanding is that any other combination is possible but not online. Hence I booked a 32kg online and called call center for help. Their call center was terrible and anything but helpful! Apparently, if you book luggage of 32kg you can only add 32kg more no option for 20kg! They didn't offer any alternatives and I was left responsible for their failure to properly inform customers of their policies! I ended up booking 62kg! Just bad overall experience left with the feeling that they just try to get your money with any means possible!

### "cleanliness of the plane an issue"
Eindhoven to Vienna with Wizz Air. The flight procedure at the airport is very easy as everything is self-service and robotic. The flight had a delay of 45 minutes, and this airline to optimize the timing and reduce the delays, basically starts the boarding procedure while the other guests are de boarding the flight. Beside the cleanliness of the plane which is definitely becoming an issue, I´m thinking about the health of the crew which is supposed to take care of me and the whole plane. The seats are very narrow and tight, extremely hard and me being tall 190cm luckily, I had to sit just for 1h 30 minutes in the plane, because it gets very narrow and uncomfortable. The staff are polite, and they tried as well to address you in German as we were flying to Austria.

### "hidden charges were unexpected"
Not Verified |  Luton to Larnaca with Wizz Air. Found a good priced ticket on a comparison site. Had to check in online 48 hrs before flying using the app. Then the hidden costs appeared. At this later hour had to pay 15 euros each to sit together each way. Pay again to ensure you could take your laptop and other expensive equipment into the cabin or it would get thrown into the hold. The trip has turned out very expensive and will never fly with them again. These hidden charges were unexpected and should be explained upon purchasing the tickets not on checking in when its too late to choose a different airline.

### "Customer service useless"
Gatwick to Gdansk has been delayed more than 12 hours. We called the customer service to know the reason of the delay. It has been confirmed by phone that the delay was due to operation issue. One of their agent  confirmed by phone on 26 July at 9:30 am UK time, that the responsibility of wizz air was engaged. Consequently, we claimed as per European directive 2004  the compensation for this delay. Moreover, we claimed the reimbursement of additional transport (from and to airport) and food fees caused by the delay. 30 days already passed. After 4 calls, a proper claim through their website No response from Wizz Air. Customer service useless and irrelevant. Next step for us is to get in touch with UK consumer associations, consumer council to prepare to trigger a legal action.

### "onboard experience was pleasant"
Bucharest to Luton. The overall onboard experience was pleasant. My WIZZ Flex ticket allowed me to choose an emergency exit row seat (26F) with ample legroom. This seat however does not have a window and I bumped into the person next to me several times due to the insufficient seat width. The cabin crew were very friendly and welcoming throughout the flight. There was a good selection of food and beverages available onboard and they were reasonably priced. When I arrived at the gate for this flight we were informed that the flight was delayed but unfortunately no passenger announcement was made to explain why. When I asked the employee at the gate they told me that the expected delay would be an hour. An hour later, we were told that our flight would depart from a different gate and we made our way to the alternate gate. We then waited another hour with no announcements made before the boarding process commenced and we were able to get on the buses. It was only once we had boarded our aircraft that we were told that the delay had been caused by a maintenance issue and that the pilot's windscreen had now been repaired. I understand that safety is paramount but I was still frustrated by the lack of information on the ground. If we were given a more accurate delay time and and actual reason for the delay back at the gate I would have been content. We finally departed 2.5 hours after our estimated time of departure. Also, the boarding process was hectic and the ground staff should have been more clear regarding priority boarding. The announcements that they did make were unintelligible and could not be heard. I would fly Wizz Air again as they are cost effective and their overall onboard product is good, but it does have to improve upon the ground service that it offers.

### "situation was really unfair to us."
We traveled from Skopje to Turku and a day before inbound flight we decided to upgrade our check-in baggage from 10 kg to 20 kg. That was a huge mistake because as we did so, we were no longer able to do online check-in or any changes to our reservation because status was no pending payment. We were bit unsure if we even were supposed to do online check-in because no head-ups email about online check-in ever came. We kept checking if status would change, but it didn't. When we arrived at airport a desk person said that transaction didn't went through and we should have had done online check-in but because it wasn't our fault, it would be ok to pay only for the bag. We were super relieved, but soon she came back and said that actually because we didn't call their call center about the issue we should pay also check in fees and the bag. We tried to explain that we weren't aware that we should have contact call centre and even if did it would have cost us 15Eur +2,9EUR per minute as we weren't our home country at time and we weren't sure about online check-in. Originally upgrade was only 11 euros and we ended up paying 134 e. We knew that with wizz air has to be very careful to read conditions carefully, but we didn't expect at all that if their system doesn't work and you can't make online check-in by yourself they will still charge you. A desk person wasn't rude, but we felt that situation was really unfair to us. The flight itself was on time and went very well. The landing was super smooth and cabin crew friendly.

### "no means to securely pay"
Basel to Bucharest. Not only are they constantly adding and revoking the small/large cabin luggage rule, but even if they stop you at boarding time, you have no means to securely pay. They asked me to tell someone my credit card number over the phone.

### "Worst experience ever!"
Budapest to Athens. Worst experience ever! I booked three tickets online using three different accounts. Two of them were WizzGo and one was basic. I always check in online so immediately after finishing the booking I was trying to get the boarding passes for me and my parents. However, the system would not let me check in for the basic ticket but somehow worked perfectly for checking in the other two. I would get notifications saying that booking was not found and that the password is incorrect. I changed the password but then it would say that I am already signed. I was trying for over 1 hour and then I was trying again the day of the flight. Surprisingly, everything started to work 2 hours before the flight. As a result I never made it to get my boarding pass online and I was forced to pay the extra fee at the airport. The staff was unprofessional and rude , they were ironic and kept saying how it is not their problem if the website was not working. Worst company ever.

### "never flying with this company again"
Luton to Cluj. There wasn't once flight with this company not be delayed. After you hand in youre passport at the airplane main desk then you pass the desk they made us wait 1.30 mins standing up. Absolutely rubbish company, I'm never flying with this company again.

### "Do not fly with them"
Tel Aviv to Luton. Worst airline booked as it was a cheap flight and needed to get home quickly to see a sick relative. I printed my boarding pass and later found out my carry on bag was too big. So I went online and paid the extra 23 euros to get Wizz Priority. Even though have the evidence on my phone off my purchase, they scanned my boarding pass (printed before I paid) and said there was no record of me paying. I had to pay again. They have me a sticker to put on my bag. I then got to the gate and they scanned my pass again, said I needed to pay third time. I luckily got the girl who checked me in was close by and remembered me. Do not fly with them.

### "I decided to leave the plane"
Luton to Kutaisi. Really uncomfortable seats, they are all crammed together and there is not much leg room at all. The captain announced that we are delayed for 40 minutes due to the windy weather (OK-I can take that), than after 40 minutes they announced that we need refuelling now and we need to go back to terminal. Refuelling ended and then 2.5 hours after waiting in this overcrowded plane they announced that the crew is due to finish their shift and we need to wait for the other crew members to come and take over. The plane started get going three times in the first hour of waiting and we all thought that it was ready to flight. I am terrified when the plane takes off and lands and every time it started accelerating I thought we were taking off and I started praying to myself. It was just a torture and my stress levels hit the roof. I panicked so much that I decided to leave the plane. Children started screaming. We were not even offered a glass of water nearly three hours sitting there like prisoners. I left the plane after 2:45 hours and not sure how long more it was delayed. Well done other passengers who remained seated there but not everyone can cope with stress in the same way. The positive thing I have got to say is about the flight attendance, they tried to persuade me and handled the situation in a professional way.

### "Worst flight experience"
Tel Aviv to Budapest. Worst flight experience we had. Their computer gave me and my wife two separate places on opposite ends of the plane on both flights, so we couldn't sit together. Many other people on the plane were in the same situation. They do this on purpose to ruin the flight experience and try to force us to pay to choose seats so we could sit together. They could have given people seats together in random places and charge for the option to choose the seats location. On the flight tickets it said we can fly with 10kg of luggage, so we brought 2 small luggage cases for the plane. When we were at the airport we found out that we can only bring small backpacks with 10kg, not small luggage cases. This was not explained anywhere when we bought the tickets. We had to pay 100 Euro to fly with our small luggage cases on both flights. And we gave up the option to travel with a big luggage case like we always do because it was too expensive to add this option. After paying the extra 100 Euro the flight tickets were more expensive than other airline companies we could have chosen. These things should have been clearly explained to us before we bought the tickets. There was no free service, all service costs an additional fee. I knew the food on the plane would be for an extra fee. But they didn't even offer people a glass of water. The seats were uncomfortable and could not recline back, so I couldn't sleep on the two flights. On the flight back the temperature in the plane was high, it was hot and I was sweating the whole flight. We will never fly with Wizz air again.

### "Wizz Air is the worst"
Luton to Kutaisi. Wizz Air is the worst. The plane was meant to take off at 17.15. The pilot tried to take off at 18.30 then realised there wasn’t any fuel. So back to the airport we rolled to fill up. Still sat here at 20.30, while they change crews. Uncomfortable seats. Unfriendly staff. Not so much as a smile. Barely an explanation. Some passengers fled after the no fuel business. Not even offered drinks. I hate this airline. They’re now saying we should take off in 40 minutes ie. 4 hours late. It will be 5am by the time we land in Georgia if indeed we do arrive. Avoid this airline at all cost. Will update later.

### "the staff were friendly"
Flying with Wizz air from Luton at the end of July was a bit of a shambles - this was due to people making their own queues and then people pushing in. Also we had to put our suitcases which were under 20kg in the oversized baggage area which we have never had to do before and we have had the vases for 10 years, which we had to queue for again. Also when you were boarding they left you in a tunnel for a good 20 minutes in the heat before allowing you on the flight. But the staff were friendly and the flight wasn’t to bad apart from the nearly two hour delay. Although the floor did look like it needed a good hoover. Coming home A much better experience the young lady at check in was brilliant she had great customer service very friendly and made us feel very happy with the service. I wish I had got her name but the flight number was W9 4460 08.08.10 @ 2.20pm. She really did make our journey home better and we would fly again with Wizz air because of her (I hope she gets acknowledged) The flight was organised better still had to wait 10 mins in the tunnel to board the plain but that aside I’m quite happy with the flights. The food was ok as well nothing flash but edible 7/10, gave an extra point due to the lady checking us in from Larnaca.

### "won’t be flying Wizz Air again"
I’ve just returned from Ohrid to Luton having been charged 35euro each for my family of 5 because I checked in at the airport. On the outbound journey from Luton I wasn’t charged when I checked in and nor was I informed of any charge. None of my family take a phone abroad (no electronics – unusual I know) and wouldn’t have been able to check in online even if we had been informed at Luton. Having spent £2400 on the flights for a 3 hr journey – getting hit for another 175euros – this adds to the generally poor Wizz Air experience – an absolute rip off. I fly 12 or 13 times a year for work to various countries and have never seen this. Wizz Air needs to be overt with key terms at the point of booking – this was not clear and is not in the flight details I was sent at the point of booking. Upon searching – it is in the terms and conditions link through to the website if you look under ‘checking in’ (whoever goes through reams of t&c’s in a contract to make sure there’s no hidden charges?). Scam. I won’t be flying Wizz Air again.

### "I would recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Friendly staff, on-time departure and easy/fast boarding from both the front and the rear of the aircraft. Flew Malmö to Gdansk, and despite the short flight duration the cabin crew offered snacks and drinks. They offered to relocate some of our fellow travelers, while on board, so that we could sit together. Would not say that it is a world-class airline, but considering the cost I would recommend this airline.

### "pay €25 for a hand luggage"
Not Verified |  Luton to Budapest. Wizz air was a horrible experience. On the inbound and outbound the flight was delayed over an hour. No communication to passenger about the delay. Then the boarding happened at a very slow pace. The most appalling is that I had to pay €25 for a hand luggage which was half empty for being 2cm bigger then their dimension. So you know you have to pay to have a normal size hand luggage that all other airlines accept! I will never fly Wizz air again and I think this is the worse airline I used!

### "pay £67 just to check in"
Luton to Prague. Awful! Booked the flight (specific seats too) however accidentally put in the wrong email address. After calling wizz air 3 times at £1.45 a minute for a total of 45 mins (being hung up on once after given the most useless information) I finally got through and after asking if I had to change my email address was told they could give me a check in ID number - great! No. This if the first time we've flown and at no point was I told to check in at least 3 hours before the flight! So got to the check in desk, was told I had to pay £67 just to check in. I haven't even got on the flight yet but already feel like I've been messed around so on top of my £287 flight I've had to pay another £132 on phone calls and checking in fees. Just to top it off I didn't even get the seats I put in. We are at opposite ends of the plane... Never again!

### "They are money making criminals"
Athens to Budapest. We booked our flights extremely early but the prices weren't cheap. Wizz air changed flight times by 3 hours and sent us an email with the details of the change. We got an email to confirm the change we did. When it was time to check in we followed their instructions and downloaded the app and put our details in (we almost always check in for all our flight) and tried to check in. It wouldn't allow us and told us to go to their website. We then went to the website and tried to check in and we had issues again. Got a message saying that there was a disruption to the flight. So we printed out all our documents and went to the airport and told them we had issues checking in online using their app and website they told us we had to pay 35 euros to check in at the airport. We told them there was an issue with their system and it wasn't our fault. They forced us to pay the additional 70 euros. Ended up being the most expensive flight for us. There was another 30 odd people who found themselves in this same situation on this flight and were requested to pay 35 euros. They are money making criminals.

### "Always a delay"
Timisoara to Luton. Rubbish airline. If you love delays then this is the perfect choice. I traveled with them a few times. Always a delay. Best thing is that they always imply an excuse.

### "Worst experience ever"
Milan to Bucharest. Worst experience ever yesterday. First thing happend when me and my boyfriend wanted to do the check in and they told us that we should go to the counter to verify our documents as they were not valid. When we got there a lady there told us that every company has a policy to sell tickets over the number allowed and we have to wait as we do not have a seat yet. Ok, we understood that and we waited in front of the desk. After 30 minutes we received a temporary ticket without seat and they told us to wait until all passengers are boarded and see if we have any seat available, of course having a wizz priority ticket..The second thing was that the flight had a delay but this is normal lately with wizz. Eventually we received some seats but when we were in the air, more than half of the flight we had turbulences and the panic on the board was very big.

### "sit separate unless you pay"
Not Verified |  Luton to Tel Aviv. Worst low-cost there could be. Normal flight company, low-cost or regular, would have let you seat next to your friend guaranteed. Here you will intentionally sit separate unless you pay. The carry-on bag is really small.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Not Verified |  Eindhoven to Poznan. In my  opinion Wizz Air is one of the worst airlines I've ever flown. They try to force you to give them more money in various ways. Today my girlfriend had a flight from Eindhoven to Poznan. Unfortunately she did not fly because one of the Wizz Air workers told her that shes had too big hand baggage. The baggage was measured many times, there was no problem when she was flying from Poznan to Eindhoven. Length, width, depth and weight was in the permitted limit. Although my girlfriend did not fly and was forced to exit the terminal. Wizz Air does not hold to its own rules, when asked they could not explain why my girlfriend wasn't able to fly although the baggage was in the limit. All that for petty 25 euros. That was our last adventure with Wizz Air  for sure. I would not recommend it to anybody. I dont mind the money and time we have spent , but that was last time with Wizz Air.

### "didn't have support system"
Luton to Prague. The flight has been canceled because of technical difficulty and failure of navigation system caused by heat. Many flights been canceled this day. However the Wizz Air company didn't deal well with the problem and didn't provide any support, food, dringks etc and let people camp and sleep at the airport. They just announced to rebook your flight which was available in 3 days time. With other companies was difficult to flight as tickets were overpriced. Wizz Air didn't have support system for this situation.

### "hope I will receive my money back"
My flight was cancelled on 25th July from Luton to Wroclaw. No information or support has been provided apart from one email sent by the airline that I can rebook my flight or apply for a refund. When I logged in to my account all flights for that weekend were fully booked. I was going to return on 29 July by Ryan Air. The airport assistant asked us to go to gate 1 so we could leave the airport. There was not anyone from Wizzair to ask questions or ask for help. The airport was very disorganized and nobody seemed to know what is going on. I tried to call wizzair few times and was put on hold for ages, nobody was picking up. I queued for hours to see somebody from Azurra and at the end one person serving 400 people left(?). My email from Wizzair said I can apply for a refund but the flight in my account was not showing that the flight was cancelled but as confirmed with a 'message' thank you for flying with us. I eventually got through someone on 27 July and was told that my flight status shows I was a non show and in order to apply for a refund need to raise a complaint (really?). The email they sent about cancellation explaining customers rights is not applied into practice. I hope I will receive my money back. So disappointing.

### "forced me to pay 100 euros"
Budapest to Rome. Wizz Air is the worst airline ever. In my last flight after passing all security checks with the boarding pass I had. They did not allow me to pass the boarding to flight. They forced me to pay 100 euros which was my only way to board the flight. I had to pay it, and I reached out to them after. It took them three weeks to respond to my complaint, and they refused to refund me for the amount.

### "35€ check in fees at airport"
Not Verified |  Cluj to Basel. All deception, in Cluj-Napoca no contact person on site although there is a basis driven. Wizz rips off passengers in which you have to pay another 35€ check in fees at the airport, although previously checked in online. Just because I have looked seat change option, which is advertised by Wizzair until departure and offered for a fee, you are automatically charged at the airport fee for 35€ again must have valid Bording kard available.

### "I think it’s outrageous"
Luton to Lviv. You cannot take your luggage in a cabin if you didn’t pay priority pass. I think it’s outrageous having a small bag and have to leave in a hold luggage. Stewardesses are not very friendly and smiley.

### "very bad customer service"
Kjevik to Gdansk. We did not receive an SMS about online check-in, only by e-mail, and therefore had to pay extra fines for 6 tickets. This was a unexpected, and very expensive extra cost! And a very bad start to our holiday. This is very bad customer service and conditions and we are all sure to not use this airline ever again.

### "Will never use again!"
Budapest to Gatwick. Appalling, they charge you for normal sized hand baggage! We had to pay 25 euro at the gate. No other airline does this. They also charge you 60 euro for checking in at the airport. Absolutely shocking. Will never use again!

### "wonderful experience"
Not Verified |  Bucharest to Oslo. I flew WizzAir, June 2019, and it was my first flight ever. Despite all the bad reviews, I had a wonderful experience with them. I had the Light “plan” selected with Wizz Priority added. I had no issues or whatsoever regarding my cabin luggage (did not have any checked-in baggage), the process at the gate went smoothly and very quickly (might be worth mentioning that on both outbound and return flights, the gate opened with a delay but regardless, everything went pretty fast afterwards). You only get priority when boarding the bus and at the gate, when they do the check-in, not when boarding the aeroplane like one may think. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful, the outbound flight was extremely smooth, no turbulences at all, the returning one had a few moments where it was slightly shaky. Yet, it was all good. The online check-in process was very easy. Be aware that if you do not check-in online, you pay a fee for the airport check-in. As for the luggage again, they even let this woman with a bag that clearly exceeded their dimensions limit in the cabin. Maybe she got lucky. Overall, I would fly Wizz again and I will in December, the same route. Absolutely love it. No “hidden” or “extra” fees as long as you read their rules carefully. For everybody else complaining, it is a low-cost company after all. Comparing it to other low-cost companies, I find Wizz the best when it comes to fares and services and everything else. It cannot get better than this.

### "Disaster from start to finish"
Athens to Luton. Disaster from start to finish. The most ridiculously unorganized company I have ever flown with I would strongly discourage you from flying with them. I probably don’t even have enough lines to describe the nightmare of flying with them. Mostly the 4 hour delay that put me into my destination at 4 am, the shuffling at the airport, the extra fees although I had tried to download the pass on my app that wasn’t working, the rude agents. It was so ongoing. The follow up “customer service” has been pathetic and infuriating .

### "Wizz Air exploits their customers"
I booked a flight with Wizz Air from Vienna to Stockholm. Two weeks before the departure, I was notified of a time change of the departure. When I tried to check-in online, the system showed that "online check-in is not possible for disrupted flights". As I arrived at the check-in desk at the airport, they charged me 35 EUR for airport check- in, although I had absolutely no other option of checking in. When I claimed a refund due to the system failure via e-mail, customer service staff dismissed it since I have not contacted their Call Center when online check-in didn’t work. First, the e-mail with the flight rescheduling never mentioned that I should contact the Call Center when online check-in doesn’t work. Second, Wizz Air charges 1.081 EUR/minute for their Call Center. Wizz Air exploits their customers by hidden fees and extra charges. Never book a flight with Wizz Air!

### "true nightmare experience"
Lisbon to Luton. Terrible experience with Wizz Air Priority which is a total joke. Lisbon airport terminal 2 can't accommodate the number of passengers it receives nor can it process priority boarding. I was one of the last to board. A true nightmare experience. Flight delayed three hours, arrived in London in the morning.

### "Hidden charges everywhere"
Not Verified |  Budapest to London. Beware Wizz Air. Hidden charges everywhere. The cost of the flights tripled once add ons combined. Didn’t open online check in until after we left home then charged 60 euros per person for airport check in. Of course we had the option to not fly, I am unlikely to use this airline again.

### "cabin crew so friendly"
Not Verified |  Cluj to Bari with Wizz Air. Flight was nice and cabin crew so friendly. I had a 30 minutes delay but it did not affect my trip. Cabin was modern and cozy. I really recommend this airline for short flights and low prices.

### "No complaints. Great"
We flew family of 4 from Luton to Athens on Monday 1st July on the 16.10 flight. We booked upfront business priority tickets which is in the top price range which came to £325 per person which in the scheme of things is above and beyond British Airways which for me in economy Europe has become a very lazy but overpriced airline. In, this price category apart from being in the more spacious front row we also got 32kg hold luggage allowance and cabin bag allowance. You can shape and fashion your travel experience by upgrading your services. If you are in basic you save money and get basic. Your choice. The departure was delayed by air traffic control but the crew managed brilliantly by managing. A visit to the cockpit which was enjoyed by many passengers. We took off 45 mins later and no one grumbled. The captain and crew were stars and worked hard and were friendly. Just be prepared to purchase the level of extras you desire. No complaints. Great.

### "Absolutely appalling"
Budapest to Luton. We arrived to check in to see a mass of people not in structured queues as there were more than double the amount of people for the standard queue barricades they had set up. It was a funnel effect of a large mass of people trying to jam in to one small entry line with no direction from surrounding staff who were simply standing there. Nobody was taking initiative. I asked a staff member where exactly we should be queuing for our flight and she directed us to 3 counters further down. We waited in the queue for half an hour. Then a different staff member asked if I was priority. I said no. She said I need to move to the next line. Turns out two lines are standard and one is priority however we weren’t told that and the priority line was written in small writing at the front counter at the bottom of the screen. After this staff member turned several people to the correct queue I suggested to her she could go through the very large line and check with people before they spend half hour in the line only to get to her and be told it’s the wrong line. She did this and subsequently 80% of the line had to move as they were also told the wrong thing. There were a lot of angry people. We then queued for another half hour in the right line only to get to the counter and the boy behind the counter to say he could not check me in. Because I hadn’t checked in online. When in actual fact my partner who booked my ticket with his on the same booking could not book me in online. He tried several times but the website seemed to not allow it. This was an IT issue not our fault however we were being penalised by being made to now pay for a ticket to be issued. We were sent to a different desk. The guy changed some things in the system. He said due to booking through an external booking provider it causes glitches in the system and I was not in my partners booking despite having a confirmation email and having paid for my ticket. He said next time to book direct. If external booking systems don’t work, then don’t allow people to buy a ticket through them? !we then had to go back to the same counter, explain to other customers why we were pushing in and then explain to the original boy that we were permitted to continue. Of which he questioned.we then only just make it to boarding and stand inline for 20 mins before another staff member who had been looking at everyone’s bags pulled me aside to say my carry on was too big. He waited til almost everyone had boarded before pulling a select few aside to charge for bags. Mine was literally 5cm over the bar: after 20 something flights this is the first time I have been stopped.my bag fit under the seat!!! This delayed the flight further due to people having to unexpectedly pay for luggage that was not questioned upon check in. Absolutely appalling, service lacking severely in initiative and customer service. Never again.

### "lack of on-time performance"
Luton to Lisbon. Over the last few weeks I have taken several flights between London and Lisbon on Wizz Air. Every flight I have taken has been delayed to some extent: the shortest delay I can recall was of 20 minutes; the longest was of about 2.5 hours. My flight on 2nd July was delayed by 1.5 hours. Wizz Air has used a variety of excuses when apologising in the aircraft for the delay in taking-off and arrival so it's not even worth repeating them. There is no point passengers and potential passengers trying to identify the reasons why this company seems incapable of taking-off and landing at the correct time, particularly on certain routes and particularly from Luton. The cabin crew on all my flights have been polite and professional but they too have seemed jaded and worn-down by the lack of on-time performance; after all, a flight that lands at 2.30am (instead of at the scheduled midnight) means a very late arrival home for the crew as well. The standard crew comment that "this is aviation and you have to expect such things" is now becoming the company's mantra. I don't care that Wizz Air charges for all types of luggage after the first small personal item; I don't care that I have to pay for seat selection as well as for food and drink; nor do I care much about the cleanliness of the exterior and interior of the aircraft. At the end of the day, I want what most people want: I want to arrive at my destination safely and at the time shown on the timetable. I regard Wizz Air as safe but, in my experience, the chances of arriving on time at a destination are, sadly, not very high.

### "Terrible customer service"
I would give them zero stars if I could. There was an issue checking into the flight as they oversell all the seats. At the airport they made me pay £32 to check in to then tell me I didn’t have a seat on the aeroplane but they would issue a refund. On my return I tried to get this refund processed and they have refused to pay. Another set of flights they drastically changed the flight times, one changing from 1525 in the afternoon to 6.50am! Terrible customer service and they are trying to rip you off where ever possible. Will definitely never book with them again. Awful company.

### "Worst experience"
Vienna to Nice. Biggest rip off ever. Stop allowing you in 3h before and then charge you 30 euros. Also, baggage drop off line was 2h long and I had to run to not miss my flight. Worst experience I’ve ever had in my life.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Luton to Bourgas. You get what you pay for with this airline Cheap tickets = cheap service, cheap staff, cheap attitude, & cheap customer service. Never before have I had such a terrible experience. Yet they seemed completely not bothered and unwilling to want to resolve anything. Avoid at all costs.

### "seats were comfortable"
Budapest to Frankfurt. Excellent flight from Budapest to Frankfurt, in new and clean A321. The flight left on time and seats were comfortable. Flight attendants friendly and attentive on a relatively full flight. Baggage rules were clearly explained on the website and I had no problem. All is required is to know how much luggage you will have and to purchase the allowance accordingly. In Budapest, boarding was by bus to the plane parked remotely. Boarding was through the front and the back door, which accelerates the process.

### "good value for mone"
Not Verified |  
Luton to Riga. Outward flight, painless, good value for money. If you obey the rules and understand the principles of low cost travel you will not suffer any charges. The offers in their cafe for food and drink offer some great savings as well. Return flight painless, good value for money and in my view one of the best low cost carriers behind easyJet.

### "idiotic baggage rules"
Budapest to Berlin. This airline tries to squeeze every cent out of your pocket, even splitting families with small children when assigning the seats! Not the mention the idiotic baggage rules and how the cabin crew is. Never again, if I could give a negative star review I would!

### "get you to buy more options"
Timisoara to Paris. The prices displayed are low. After booking you will receive several emails to get you to buy more options. At the airport, if they are not happy with your boarding pass screenshot you pay huge extra amount.

### "Worse company I ever used"
Iasi to Luton. Tried to do the check in with two days before my flight was due and couldn't do this. When got to the airport they told me that I have to pay 35 euro per person because I couldn’t do the check-in online they will do it for me and my husband and paid 70 euros. Also I had the chance not to fly because the plain was overbooked. They sell more tickets then the places they have. They put us on standby until they boarded other people. Paid for 3 full tickets and it was the possibility of me and my baby not to fly. They are ripping off people. Your better off to pay little bit extra and get better service. In the end you end up paying more then any other company with them. Tickets are cheaper but all other fees and invented fees will cost you a lot. Worse company I ever used.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Luton to Budapest. Worst airline ever. This is my 6th time with then and I will never fly with them again. The aircraft were dirty and my flights were delayed regardless of the airport or the destination. Once you paid for the ticket they don’t care about you or your comfort/experience. Really cheap but they don’t deserve any money for this awful service. Next time I won’t mind traveling further to another airport and paying more for another airline.

### "disgusted with this company"
Tallinn to Luton. Absolutely disgusted with this company. If you want to sell flights for high prices do so but don’t sell them at competitive prices then keep adding and adding to the price. You buy your ticket then if you want to travel with the people you are going with you all have to buy seats together or Wizz Air will try it’s best to put you as far away from each other as possible. And yes it does say on your ticket your only allowed to take a small rucksacks but who reads that? Everyone takes a cabin bag as all airlines allow them, not Wizz Air though, you go to board and your hit with another 27 Euro bill. I won’t be flying with these crafty people anytime soon.

### "Very unprofessional staff"
Luton to Bucharest. Very unprofessional staff at the airport. I paid extra for priority boarding but ended up among the last people to board the plane. They lost my luggage last December and haven't heard back from them since. Their call centre is a joke. The person assigned to deal with my claim doesn't even reply to my emails. It's worth paying a bit extra and fly with a decent company that has some respect for their passengers.

### "had a row to themselves"
Vienna to Milan. I was pleasantly surprised by Wizz Air. The aircraft a new A321, comfortable for its capacity with a tasteful interior design. The crew were lovely and attentive, happy to have conversations with passengers. It’s a low cost airline so the service is basic but perfectly suitable for the flights Wizz do. The passenger load on this Saturday evening flight was low so the crew encouraged people to spread out. Most solo passengers had a row to themselves. Slight negative there was no gate announcement for the 30 minute delay due to late arrival of the aircraft, the gate had the original departure time even when we were boarding well after it. Flight crew were apologetic however.

### "Airport check in will cost you €25"
Reykjavik to Luton. Awful - they sell you a ticket and then monetise everything on top. App doesn’t work? Airport check in will cost you €25. Didn’t see the single bit of hand luggage has to be a handbag - not a suitcase like every other airline?

### "monetize you in any way"
Dortmund to Vienna. This company will try to monetize you in any way they can. Read the fine print. Check in between 48 and 3 hours before your flight. Hope they sit you next to the person you booked with and try not to pay too much attention to the condition of the plane as you are boarding and it will be fine. Otherwise expect to pay 2x or 3x the listed ticket price and be nervous.

### "nothing to complain about"
Riga to Dortmund. This year I flew 5 times with wizz air and it was all on point, nothing to complain about. Fresh and modern looking aircraft, friendly staff, seats were good for low-budget airline. I am happy when I see that Wizz Air has a offer for my travel route

### "a horrible company"
Vilnius to Luton. Just a horrible company. They purposefully create problems for their customers in attempt to rip them off, getting out of it by having some language in the small print. One such behaviour is closing online check-in before you fly and then charging totally unrealistic charges at the airport. I saw so many other people get caught out too. Other horrible behaviour involves purposefully seating you apart when seats together are available in attempt to get you to pay for the privilege. Again no other airline functions this way, with the simple objective of catching you out as many times as possible. I have complained the the aviation authority as I don't think it should be allowed.

### "No consideration for elderly"
Budapest to Madrid. Avoid using at all cost. Worst flight and ground crew ever. No consideration at all for the elderly. No wheel chair facility nor seats for elderly at waiting line. Rude flight crew.

### "a very nice flight"
Vienna to Eindhoven, a very nice flight. Seat was 12A with extra legroom. Flight was almost on time. Cabin crew was young but did a good job and was very friendly.

### "Overall okay"
Vienna to Kiev. My flight was purchased for 45 euro including priority, big carry on and 20 kg hold bag. Web-site easy to navigate and with all fees and charges easy to understand. While their bag charges and carry on allowances are reasonable if not generous, the seat charge is overestimated, but when you don't mind middle seat you can skip it. Another big minus of Wizz is their seat. Uncomfortable. Even exit row with extra legroom. The angle of recline is just bad. Legroom is bearable. Ryanair seats are fine with similar legroom. Wizz seats are not fine. In-flight catering options are slightly overpriced and not very appetizing. The rest was positive. Toilets are available and clean, no lines. Cabin was clean. Boarding was usual low cost with bus ride on departure and walk to terminal on arrival. Take off and landing bang on time. Check in at Vienna airport was ok, bag in Kyiv appeared on the belt in 5 min after immigration. Overall okay, but all the negatives are around seating policy and arrangement. Will fly again.

### "35 Euros to print boarding pass"
Bucharest to Tel Aviv. Bad company, They know how to take money from people. I paid 60 Euros for a 13.5kg baggage and 35 Euros to print the boarding pass in the reception.

### "horrific customer service"
Luton to Larnaca. Absolute horrific customer service. Rude staff and check bag in on basis of wheels not size. Told me I had to pay for my bag cause they only took a set number of wheels bags per flight yet never indicated before that wheels were an issue. Then on flight had loads of room spare. Plus my bag fits under seat. Have flown numerous airline very regularly and have never been treated like this.

### "Service and crew were good"
Eindhoven to Vienna. A great experience with Wizzair this time. Altough the flight was delayed by 2 hours it was a nice flight. I was seated in 12F wich has extra legroom and a great engine view. Service and crew were good and prices for food and drinks were also quite good.

### "use the paying service"
Budapest to Nice. When you book for another person than for yourself (the one having the account) you really have to verify that you uncheck a little button. I still haven't found out,  because as I booked for another person and automatically Wizz Air put me as the flying person, no way to review or to change. So I saw the mistake only when I got the booking mail - too late. Although I contacted the customer service right away, it was finished. No "sorry for the inconvenience, yes of course we arrange this mistake" like many other airlines already did, or "sorry that our website is not clear". The only answer I got was "please use the paying service, and this is 45€"!

### "coercion is not acceptable"
Baku to Frankfurt via Budapest. Cheap yes, but coercion is not acceptable in any type of business. Add in the yelling and inappropriate comments and you get the client service provided by Wizz Air at Budapest airport.

### "plane has been downgraded"
Luton to Ljubljana. Horrible experience. All the passengers were separated after our boarding passes and passports have been checked and then half of us were told not to proceed to the plane, but rather step back and wait- nothing was explained, completely unorganised and ignorant. We waited for a long time, then they decided to check our passes and passports again and told us the plane has been downgraded (probably overbooked) so they picked who gets to board it and who waits for the next flight.

### "be prepared for basic"
Luton to Athens. I have flown with them a number of times now and, although you are prepared for a bit of discomfort and hassle when you book with a budget airline, you can normally adjust this to your needs with an upgrade or purchase of extras that they all offer. In this case it was their priority package so that i could take an extra piece of luggage. The problem with this is that you may get priority check in to the departure lounge (i.e. before the rest of the passengers) but not the plane, for which there is an absolute free for all, including fights for luggage space. More worrying, on the check in'at Athens airport no id checks were made at all! So either be prepared for basic or go elsewhere, because you will not get what you pay for. If you complain all you will get is 'thank you for your feedback' and you get no further

### "charge you for anything"
Budapest to Luton. Worst airline I’ve flown with, they'll charge you for anything they can, 40euro per person just to check in at the airport! And the hand carry allowance is just a ridiculous little backpack. Will never fly Wizz Air again

### "behaviour is intolerable"
The online check-in assign couple who book flight together at opposite end of the plane and both middle seats! At the time of check in, 71% of the seats are empty, we thought with so many seats available we should be able to sit together as both of our name are under the same booking code. They assign my seat at the front of the plane and my husband at the very back of the plane and both middle seats. Then immediately take me to the page where I can pay for our seats so that we can sit together, and they are £9 per sit per trip, so it will be £36 more if we want to sit together. They try to bully and extort us and the behaviour is intolerable.

### "avoid this airline"
Gatwick to Budapest. Just avoid this airline. My flight to Budapest was delayed nearly an hour, and by the time I went out of the airport it's over 1:20am. I needed to find ways to call the B&B owner in the midnight at 3am when I got to the centre. On my return flight, there's a guy at the gate holding a ruler measuring passengers' baggage and I was told that my luggage was '3cm longer' than the allowed 40cm and then they charged me 25 Euro (there were still a lot of empty seats in the end; a 3cm longer luggage was totally okay for the spare space). Two more innocent couples and a passenger without chek-in online beforehand were also charged a great deal. I don't know whether there were more passengers being charged, as I was called to the front to pay for my 'oversized' luggage. I have to say that if these policies are so important, then the airline should put this on the front page of their website. The attitude of the guy dealing with the luggage size was particularly unfriendly, and it's just like a policeman checking whether I am a criminal. The feeling was totally awful and I was not well respected. Just choose other airlines such British Airways or Ryanair to avoid unexpected delays or charges.

### "charged 37 euros airport check in"
Lisbon to Luton. Today was charged 37 euros due to airport check in. The app did not show me any warning or reminder. Later at the airport when demanding to write down a complaint was Informed there is none and actually Wizz does inform at their website. Be careful with Wizz Air. It's just one more dodgy company trying to suck your pennies whenever possible.

### "avoid this greedy airline"
Avoid this unprofessional and greedy airline. Trip Lisbon-Kiev 9 May 2019 The flight was rescheduled to the next day (22 hours delay). This great company just left all passengers alone for a night in the airport with absolutely no support from their side: - no assistance with the hotel - no assistance with food or even a bottle of water - no help was provided at all. There were many passengers with kids, pregnant women, elderly people. Please avoid this airline, it is the only way we can show them they need change their behavior or just close their business if they don't respect their passengers of all categories. They were in breach of each and every EU rule.

### "dissatisfied and angry"
Tirana to Luton. Very dissatisfied and angry with this airline. They like to rip people off. My wife and I were on our way back to Luton. We tried to check in online however their website was not working properly. Even though when we tried to do this on a laptop, phone and on different browsers and site still was not working. When I went for help to Tirana Airport they charged us €35 euros each for check in and €20 for a carry on which was within allowance (and the same carry on we had from Luton to Tirana (only one piece as we went away for less than 48 hrs)). On the same flight, half of the passengers who had to board had the same problem as us because the website was not working. As they did not want to miss their flight they were obliged to pay. As soon as we landed I complained to Wizzair online. Next day, I received a reply just copying and pasting their terms and conditions. They did not even bother to investigate this matter, no apologies no nothing. Also no refund she wrote. I replied back saying that I do not want copying and pasting paragraphs, I want a reply from the highest manager as her email was not addressing all my points and she showed no remorse. I received a second reply next day and again it was from her (they seem to not have a manager at all). At the end she wrote the following: " I would like to inform you that Wizz Air has exhausted its internal complaint handling process" which shows that I should not bother them anymore and as she mentioned in her previous email again "no refund". This airline makes sure that the online check in does not work all the time so they can cheat the passengers at the airport. At this point, I don't care about the money but I am annoyed how this airline treats the passengers. They seem to have a ready made (reply) template for all the complaints as they might receive receive quite a few a day.

### "left me with an unpleasant mood"
Budapest to Rome. While I have nothing special to say about the onboard staff (they were neither nice nor rude, almost non-existent, I would say), I was appalled about the attitude of the Wizzair staff at the airport. First of all, the boarding gate did not appear on the display for long time (even though we were very close to the departure time). When it finally did, the number was accompanied already by a flashing "BOARDING" sign which put pressure on us. The gate was A17 so we followed the signs and at one point the signs indicated a direction for gates A12 - A19. Here it's when I noticed, on the side, a Wizzair staff screaming something which I could not understand so I went to her asking what is that she was saying and she was extremely rude and basically shoved us (not indicated) to another Wizzair staff (would have not been easier to put a sign akin to "A12 to A19 except Wizzair passengers" rather than having that rude woman screaming?". So we went to this other person, this time a man who was checking the boarding passes and the size of the backbags without ever lifting his head and with the utmost scary expression. He sent me on one queue while my friends to another. When I asked him why, even though we were on the same flight, he sent us on two different queues, his brusque reply was: "There is a difference, just go". Is this a normal reply to someone who is asking you something? To a customer? I fully understood that it deeply bothers them when someone ask them a question, silly or clever that it may be, they just don't want question. I wonder why they chose this job and why there are allowed to treat people this way. Since this left me with an unpleasant mood, I will never spend another penny to fly with this company, not matter how cheap it is compared to other airlines.

### "charged me 70€ for my baggage"
Budapest to Athens. They charged me 70€ for my baggage because the wheels were exceeding the check. Normally the charge was 60€. The flight was delayed 1 hour delay.The reason was that the gate was announced 50 minutes before take-off. The gate was something like an openair lane through the rain and cold. Just use another company if your budget is close to the prices of Wizz Air.

### "Avoid this airline"
Luton to Tel Aviv, A day before my flight they sent me a message that my flight was cancelled, they said they were issuing me a full refund and I had to book another flight. I booked a different flight and instead of refunding me, they gave me 'wizz air credits'. They scammed me out of £600. When I called them they put me on hold for 25 minutes then hung up. I then received a £55 telephone bill for that phone call. The flight itself was late, and our 6 hour flight included no food or snacks. I asked for water during the flight and no one would give me any free. Avoid this airline like the plague.

### "carry on was 0.5cm too large"
Not Verified |  Katowice to Luton. They charged us £18 at check in because our 5 year olds Trunki carry on case was 0.5cm too large We complained to customer care and had an unhelpful patronising reply in broken English. They attached a made up invoice showing £13, it was £18! We are previously loyal customers who have literally spent thousands of pounds in 10 years. Beware if your kiddies have a Trunki they will stiff you £18 in Katowice. No problem with the lovely handlers at Luton just the sour faced jobsworths in Katowice.

### "recommend not to use this airline"
I got double-charged baggage fee at airport although I already paid in advance. The staff said you should ask customer care. After the flight, I asked refund via customer support because of this double charge. Customer care didn't respond so I needed to follow up 2-3 times every week, then, they just wrote "we will contact you once we get update". Then it took almost 2 month in such poor situation since the first contact. Customer care just said "Sorry, we cannot refund" "Can we close ? . with no compensation, compromising. I have never experienced such poor airline services compare to other LCC. I strongly recommend not to use this airline anymore.

### "Flight crew was nice"
First flight of the day plus Debrecen Airport is pretty small, so no delay at boarding or departure. Everything went well and smooth. Flight crew was nice and they also provided all the useful information about the route flight. We expected to arrive in time to BCN, but at the end the flight took more than 30 minutes more then they announced and we arrived late. I assume it could be due to weather or traffic reasons, but a minimum information could be good in such a case. As it was Easter time, the price of the ticket was also quite high so this brings down the price-value ratio.

### "€35 for a boarding pass"
Not Verified |  Athens to Budapest. I wasn’t able to proceed with the online check-in process on their app without paying to select a seat. I don’t care where I sit on short flights so instead I waited to check in at the airport. This is when they then made me pay a €35 fee for a boarding pass. It seems they were going to make me pay extra one way or another. They have ways of extorting money from you. Beware.

### "was beyond unsatisfactory"
Bucharest to Luton. From start to finish the experience was beyond unsatisfactory, even for a budget airline. The customer service was astoundingly bad, if existent at all. Our flights were delayed on both occasions without any communication. We paid above average prices for a below average service. Never do we leave reviews but we need to warn you not to fly with Wizz air. Unless you want delays and to be ignored.

### "flight was absolutely spot on"
London to Bucharest. I’ve flown with Wizz Air a lot over the last few years. Purely because of the price of the flights. Overall they aren’t that great, but when you compare it to the price you pay it’s excellent. They take off late and are regularly delayed. Luckily enough this flight was absolutely spot on. Although the cabin crew are getting really aggressive with the baggage allowance, where they shout at customers for putting a backpack in the over head locker.

### "very disappointing!"
Bucharest to Luton. Very disappointing! I came from the UK to Romania and had no issues. However, on the way back, I had the worst flight experience! Bucharest staff  tried to charge me for extra luggage, which I paid 20 euros for. When I got to the gate, they said that I paid the wrong amount, that I should have paid 25 euros and that now it is late and I should pay 60 euros instead. I started explaining that it was not my fault, but they did not admit that the mistake was theirs until another gentleman came over and offered to pay for my luggage. This was the last time I travelled with WizzAir!

### "my bag is too big "
Paris to Belgrade. I booked this 220 euros flight expecting to pay the bus to and from Beauvais airport (30 euros) making it a 250 euros. I won't express my disappointment towards the bus service here because it is not under the control of Wizz air. But after arriving at the beauvais airport and after having queued for 30 min for the security check, the security guard tells me that my bag is too big and needs to be checked in. For thr record I have a 20-30-50cm bag. 10cm too big according to the small characters. First company ever not letting me board with this sized bag. I had to run to the wizzair desk who told me "we have closed. Go to the information desk and explain your problem there". Which I did and had to pay 27 euros additional. I am expecting to pay the same on my way back. Making Wizz air ticket 304 euros meaning more expensive than a "non-low cost company". In a nutshell, I almost missed the flight and was stressed out. Very unpleasant experience.

### "ground staff had no knowledge"
Lisbon to Luton. The flight was late the ground staff had no knowledge, what to do and how to handle the passengers, people were stranded next to gate for long time before boarding, and passengers were getting mixed messages on the display screens The flight was supposed to be a direct flight but it was made indirect due to fuel strikes in Portugal and had a long stop over on the way. The pilots did not switch off seat belt sign because of the stop over 45 minutes after the take off, so no food was served and use of toilet was not possible, during the stop over, people were not allowed to use toilets. The cabin crew was not less than a joke, without proper command of English.

### "pay a €35 check-in fee"
Firstly they rescheduled my flight (delayed by four hours) without giving a real reason. And because of that their online website would not allow me to check in online. When I showed up at the airport, they made me pay a €35 check-in fee. When I argued that their website wouldn't let me check in, the stewardess was totally unsympathetic and rude and argued that I don't have any proof that I did try to check in, even though the customers right before me and behind me had the same experience! After further arguing, she told me I can file a claim on their website. But when I filed a claim after my flight, the company refused to reimburse me, saying that it's my fault for not checking in online. Horrible service! Totally trying their best to charge us more without warning

### "second flight, second disappointment"
Not Verified | Luton to Kiev. The worst company - my second flight and my second disappointment. On way to KIV I tried to do check in on line but I couldnt. I have done it in Luton Airport 1.5 hours before the flight without any problems. When I come back I had the same problem with online check in. So I decided to do it at airport. I came 2:40 hours before the flight and when I wanted to do check in Ii was finding out that must pay a penalty charge of 35 Euro.

### "terrible customer service"
Sofia to Malaga. This is the most terrible customer service in the world. It's clear that they want money but they take it in so ugly manner, that normal people are disgusted. I mean the luggage and seats policy which is working on the principle pay-more-or-suffer. The only reason why people choose to fly with Wizz Air are the low prices. But those prices are misleading, because they offer unacceptably nasty conditions if you don't pay additionally. I recommend to avoid this company.

### "be aware of this trick"
Not Verified |  Having flown with Wizzair in the past and been happy with the experience even though the flight times were not great. I had planned to take another trip with them and went through the process of selecting flights and although not happy with their baggage rip off and the bad flight times I went to check out and discovered that although the flight prices were in GBP I had to choose a different currency to pay in and that is when the final rip off occurs. The conversion they use adds approximately 10% extra to the flight cost, I was furious, I hate hidden charges and did not proceed with booking and wanted to warn other people to be aware of this trick.

### "never fly again with them"
Luton to Bucharest. Starting before the flight! I booked the Flexibility to change my flight for an extra 30 Pounds per person, but when I tried to change the flight the homepage did not accept the payment for 3 hours, every time a re login was necessary the price doubled until it was more expensive than the original booking. Wizz Air is trying to trick you into an increased payment with absolutely everything! You can expect that from the moment you booked your ticket for a good price till your actually flying the price doubled (by changing luggage regulations, or other tricks they use). My conclusion is I will never fly again with them!

### "Very unprofessional"
Luton to Gdansk. Wizz Air changed my flight and offered a compensation. It's been credited to my wizz Air account. After some time I decided to fly with them to use that money. On the payment page I selected the option to use that money, but unfortunately they charged my credit card with the whole amount. My credit has not been applied and my money stays with them. I made a complaint but they ignored it saying that the credit is not refundable and the only way to get it back is to buy another ticket. Again and again? Very unprofessional. I feel like someone just stole my money.

### "Wizz air, never again."
Malmö to Vienna. Rescheduled on both outbound and home. Rescheduled from 8pm to 8am outbound and from 2000pm to 05.35 home. We paid for priority boarding but there were no priority boarding really, before all with priority boarding had boarded the other passengers were let on. We skipped the return ticket and booked tickets on another company. In other words, what we had hoped would be a cheap flight ended up being more expensive, who wants to leave at 05.35 in the morning? Beside the terrible time you miss one day on your weekend trip. Wizz air,never again.

### "a delay at both airports"
Luton to Larnaca. The staff at Luton Airport were rude, pushy and downright unprofessional. There was a delay at both airports with no explanation and no apology. The prices charged for 10kg or 20kg luggage are extortionate and make the overall trip very expensive compared to other airlines doing the same route.

### "Very disappointed"
Lasi to Luton. Never again! The employees from Wizz Air Iasi airport shouldn't work in a international airport! They don't know to interact with customers, they are not educated enough for customers service! They are frustrated and rude! Shame on them! If I could select 0 stars, I would, but I can't so I'm force to give them 1! Very disappointed.

### "Worst airline I’ve travelled"
Not Verified |  Luton to Tel Aviv. Worst airline I’ve ever travelled with! My daughter and son in law booked my husband and I a trip to Tel Aviv. She tried to check in for us online with no luck. She tried to add a baggage to the aircraft online after the booking, again with no luck. Therefore we had to pay for our check in and our bag when we got to the airport. It was £110 there and £110 back. Basically the cost of another flight!! The staff at the check in counter at Luton were rude and unprofessional. And on the flight coming home from Tel Aviv, the air stewardess moved us from our seats at the front which my daughter paid additionally for so we could be comfortable and sat us at the back of the airline. I am so disgusted with this airline! Our holiday was fantastic and would have been even more so had we flown with another airline. I would not advise you to book this airline. Spend a little bit more money for more class.

### "had no baggage problems"
Not Verified |  Luton to Bucharest. I found the Cabin Crew to be polite and professional, and we had plenty of leg room. People, ought to make their own entertainment on short flights? The refreshment service was fast and orderly, and I had no baggage problems, as we stayed within the required limit. Three of us flew without problems. I would fly with Wizz Air again. Check out at passport control, was an utter mess, people pushing, and queue jumping, trying to by pass security.

### "Very poor service"
Not Verified |  Riga to London. Cheap ticket, cheap airline. Staff at Riga airport is ridiculous. Flight was delayed, then no apologies whatsoever, plus treating all passangers like cattle. Very poor service.

### "pay extra £90 for baggage"
Budapest to Brussels. Stay away from this airline. Had really really bad experience. Very poor customer service. I was about to board then they realised that but luggage is big they forced me to pay extra £90 for baggage that i have used on every airline without any trouble. But my main concern is that the guy on desk was extremely rude. Shouting on us my 10 year old daughter got scared. I was trying to be polite with him few times.

### "I had not passed security"
Luton to Tel Aviv. I bought my ticket via Budget Air, when checking in I was not offered an option to choose a seat, I called the airline before departure and had no issues. when I called before the return I was advised I had not passed security even though I answered a bunch of questions the final was the email and phone number of the agency i booked with. When i advised that they did it for me on the way out i was advised it was against their DPA, i asked for a manager and was advised that they don't take calls.

### "will never use them again"
Athens to  Luton. I don't mind flying low-cost airlines for short flights in Europe but I am so disappointed with this airline's ground staff and online customer service, I will never use them again. I am a frequent flyer from London to Athens on low cost and upmarket airlines as well. On my return with a Wizz Air flight to LTN I discovered my suitcase wheel completely torn off leaving a gaping hole on my case (for which I paid £22 for checked luggage fyi). I went straight to the Wizz Air customer services counter and explained what just happened, I showed the damage to the ground staff and they advised me that I should just email Wizz with photos. I specifically asked if I need proof from the airport for this complaint and she simply said no, which I did find odd but that has never happened to me before so I did not know the procedure. Naturally, when I emailed Wizz from home, they demand a number of paperwork including a Property Irregularity Report, which is obtained from the airport right there and then. Even though I have explained numerous times that I do not have the PIR form due to no neglect of mine, but because their staff failed to inform me correctly at their own counter, all I get is copy-paste robotic replies that they want the PIR form in order to process my complaint. When I called and I explained once more the issue, I was told that my case would be escalated to a senior department and I will hear back in 4-6 weeks. 3 months have passed with no reply, so I contact them again to check the process of my complaint. Guess what reply I get? A copy-paste robotic request of my PIR form. I am exasperated with their handling of my case both at the airport, online and over the phone, so far this has cost me £22 for checked-in baggage fees + £100 for a new suitcase as I was travelling again a week later + £20 on the phone bill for calling their expensive customer service line!

### "Very disappointing"
I couldn't check-in online due to unclear messages I received on Wizz Air system. I got a message on the system asking me to confirm that I will be charged to get a seat on the flight. It was also saying that I should try checking in later if I want to check in free of charge. As advised in the message, I tried checking in again later but this time check in was completely closed. I tried to explain myself and what I have been through to the Wizz Air personnel at Prague airport but nobody listened to me and I had to pay 30 pounds to check-in. I raised the issue with customer service but they did nothing apart from sending me copy paste messages from their terms and conditions. Very dissappointing! I will never ever use this airline again!

### "crew efficient and friendly"
Not Verified |  Be aware priority does not include cost of booking seats only an extra bag. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. Some delay outward due to change in gate at Luton but only 45 mins. On way back everything very efficient boarding and landing. Would  use again. Only concern I have is there was a medical emergency on landing at Larnaca. Crew were totally unable to deal with it as they had been told by the Captain to wait for the ground medics. Myself and another medically trained passenger took over. We had to wait for airport medics and there were no blankets on board to keep him warm. We did get him more comfortable, calmed the relatives and gave vital information to medics once they arrived. I would suggest the medical policy is reviewed to ensure blankets are available when needed and more medical kit is allowed to be used. However on way out staff had coped well with an hysterical female passenger with minimum politeness and professionalism. They must have been relieved to see us all depart from that flight For the money and convenience this airline are totally acceptable. The food and drink were very nice and available through out the flight. Seats and leg room ample for short haul.

### "don't know how to say sorry"
Luton to Athens. Yesterday, we got here 7:01 and the flight was suppose to take off at 7:20. The receptions did not let us on the plane, we were charged another £75. Today 23/03 am here and the plane has been delayed for an hour and all they are saying is that is not our fault, whose is it? The customer service team don't know how to say sorry.

### "you get what you pay for"
Doncaster to Vilnius, decent flights both ways and crews pleasant for LCC. Usual fare so you get what you pay for. The only thing they could do with sharpening up on is the priority boarding which tends to be a bit chaotic. The other thing they seem very keen on is getting you standing on stairs waiting to board - every time I’ve flown with them I’ve ended up standing in a stairwell for 15-20 minutes. Other than that I would use again.

### "crew were friendly and accommodating"
Luton to Wroclaw. The check-in was smooth with a mobile boarding pass. Wizz priority with affordable price gave me cabin lugagge and speedy boarding. The food on the flight was available for purchase but had good meal deals. Flight departed on time and the crew were friendly and accommodating. The pilot explained the flight status and take off and landing was excellent without any abrupt landing. I found the service and time prompt excellent. I would recommend flying with them. Seats are randomly assigned unless you purchase them and airline seats not very cushioned but was great for short haul.

### "not a low cost company anymore"
Luton to Larnaca. As Wizz Air customer service told me that the system is trying to seat families together but make the check in ASAP I woke up and done the check in exactly 48 hours before departure hoping to get seats together as buying them would be a rip off. So I checked in and me and my daughter are seating in one place while my husband is seated on a different place and there are many 3 seats together available. Also they made sure the seat next to us was taken so we can't buy only one seat. Also buying extra luggage is so expensive for this flight and we had to rely on the tiny carry on bag. Soon we will have to pay for that as well. So this is not a low cost company anymore. I'm very upset.

### "never book  WizzAir again"
Luton to Larnaca. We were waiting in the boarding and 45 minutes they decided to give a nonsense reason for the long waiting. Also, most of the people that travel with WizzAir had problems with their luggage as they did not reach their destination on time. I will never book with WizzAir again even if the ticket fare is £10.

### "staff  very rude"
Bucharest to Luton. Every time when the departure is from Bucharest the staff that is checking the tickets is very rude. All the rest is ok. They always find problems to your luggage and this is happening only from Bucharest.

### "Wizz Air have become greedy"
Not Verified |  Keflavík to Gdansk. Been a customer several times since 2005 but Wizz Air have become greedy, lazy and the seats are really uncomfortable. I've flown with many airlines all over the world and Wizz Air has the worst seats ever! Also, its very annoying and makes me angry that when checking in online together with a travel companion they put you in opposite ends of the plane and will not let you sit together unless you pay a lot of money extra! I don't care if they're sometimes cheaper but I've had enough.

### "get the best experience"
Dortmund to Nis. The flight was extremely good. Wizz Air is a low-cost company but you get the best experience. All you need to know about entering an airplane or a ticket can be easily found on their site. You just need to be well informed.

### "the seats are so tight"
Timisoara to Luton. Poor service from starting with the boarding. Announcing gates will be open in 5 min, they are actually opening in 40 min. The plane looks flimsy, the seats are so tight that even I’m 1,60m and still struggling to fit in, let’s not even talk about spreading your legs a bit.

### "the lowest of the low"
Not Verified |  Luton to Ljubljana. Quite simply the lowest of the low. Useless and rude. Avoid at all costs. They charge you £33 to print a boarding pass and employ the most incompetent people they can find. It's almost as though they do it on purpose.

### "a rubbish flight"
Not Verified |  Cluj-napoca to Liverpool. At the airport they wanted to take my over sized baggage away without giving me a receipt or labeling it and staff were not polite  in these situations which made it worse. So not a good start. I fly several times a year and this plane had the worst leg room experienced. I am 6ft but can always get my legs in, even if tightly. On this plane I had to sit in an aisle seat to be able to get one leg in on an angle and the other in the aisle. Because I was bolt upright I couldn't put my head on the rest. No recline to help either. Hence a rubbish flight.

### "Don't fly with this airline"
Not Verified |  Luton to Larnaca. Wish I read some of these reviews before I flew with them. Got ripped off big time. Got charged at the gate for our cabin bags £48, the same bag I fly every where with. How clever were they. They wait until you get to the gate when you have no one to give your case too before dropping the bombshell on you. I said I have no money and they said leave it and get it back on your return flight. They said get priority on the way back and you won't have this problem. We did and thought we had for £20, however, when I called to confirm why its only for one of us, they said, it's £14 for the case and £6 for the admin fee. I explained, I did it on line which clearly says it free but no she argued it is what it is. Tried several times to check in online but couldn't. Got to the airport and was charged 70euros to check in. We explained we tried and they said, sorry they are only doing what they have been told and if we don't pay, we can't fly. The only reason we checked in coming back because one had seat at 4 and the other at 26 row going over to Cyprus. They never charged us at Luton to check in but return they did. Don't understand how they keep changing the rules to suit themselves and not the customers. The staff are so rude and not very helpful at all, you have to pay and that it. No apology or explanation. Don't fly with this airline. Pay a little more and use another airline as they will always find another charge to hit you with. The bosses really need to be looking at what is going on with their airline otherwise they will go the same why as a lot of other airlines, down the pan. Diabolical Experience.

### "friendly and efficient"
Excellent journey from London Luton to Budapest with Wizz Air. My experience from start to finish was outstanding, the airline is very efficient in the handling of luggage and as long as you pay clear attention to the cabin bag requirements you will be absolutely fine and avoid any fines. We were initially very sceptical of flying with this airline with its bad reviews, however we were delighted to find that the airline was excellent. The flight itself was smooth, seats were spacious even for my 6’4 partner. All staff we encountered were friendly and efficient. Thoroughly impressed!

### "really uncomfortable"
Frankfurt to Kiev. I paid for check-in in the Frankfurt airport 35 EUR per person. Also, we bought priority boarding, which did not exist. Also, we paid for the cabin bags, but there are no places to leave them. We kept them front of our chair. It was really uncomfortable. Also, they drove us by bus to the plane for 15 minutes. Never buy priority boarding via Wizz Air. Try to not to fly by this airline even if the flight ticket is cheaper. You will pay more on boarding.

### "25 eur extra for cabin bag"
Not Verified |  Billund to Iași. Had to pay about 25 eur extra for cabin bag. Cabin bag allowed only with priority check in, but the information are somehow hidden between all the offers pushed through the online operation of buying and checking in. It is important to read well all the information on the website!

### "Ended up paying twice"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. Do not fly with Wizz Air. Having paid for checking in my luggage, it looked like it fitted in the bag sizes so I decided to take the bag on the plane, only to find out there are 2 different bag sizers. Ended up paying twice. Fly with BA from Heathrow to Sofia instead!

### "steer clear of Wizz Air"
I have also encountered problems with Wizz Air. Their customer service helpline, because of their complicated website I rang the customer service number and was charged £8.71 for a 4 min call, and still no help! Was charged an extra €25 for my cabin bag, that bag has been all over the world and never been charged before! On checking in for return flights, the app would not let me book seats together with my wife. But surprise surprise, after I had pressed the random seats option, I was offered the option to change seats, at a cost of €37 each! What a rip off, steer clear of Wizz Air.

### "Do not fly with this airline"
Not Verified |  Luton to Tromsø. Do not fly with this airline - customer care is non existent. While they will fulfil their legal obligations, they have no concern towards their passengers. We were unnecessarily delayed 31 hours, leading to many people cancelling their entire trip. Following an aborted landing due to bad weather (understandable if due to safety reasons, although other flights managed to land 30 mins before and afterwards), we were redirected to Stavanger in south Norway, two thirds of the way back to our starting point. There were many airports on the way that we could have stopped at instead (Trondheim, Narvik, Alesund, Bergen, Oslo, the list goes on) so we knew there was something not right going on, and were given minimal updates throughout (for example, where Stavanger was). Two hours after landing there, we were told that we were being returned to Luton and there was no other option. There was no reason for this redirection all that way except that the airline knew they needed the plane in the morning for other flights, and lied to the passengers about the reason. They could have put us up in Oslo/Trondheim/Alesund/Bergen etc and returned to Tromso early the next morning - surely that is easier and cheaper for them in fuel costs than having to take an entire plane back to London and then put on an entirely new flight the next day?

### "customer services are terrible"
Birmingham to Warsaw. Wizzair customer services are terrible. It would be better if customer services didn’t exist at all. The company would save lots of money on useless call centres, their employees, trainings. That’s how they deal with my query: ”We are sorry to inform you that we do not provide support in the Polish language. Because we want to help you with your request, we kindly ask you to address another claim in one of these languages: Bulgarian, English, German, Serbian, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Italian, or Catalan.” Despite many emails and phone calls in English language, 6 months later I still haven’t received any answer to my claim. All I heard was: “I’ll escalate Your case to adequate department and they will contact You”. Last person I spoke to contradicted herself when I asked to confirm the date they would contact me further and in the end she hang up on me. Will I fly with Wizzair again? Yes, they are cheap. Will I use any of their additional services?

### "stay away from this airline"
Larnaca to Luton. Absolutely stay away from this airline, never brings your hold luggage along with the flight. Came from Cyprus yesterday and my 5 luggage are still in Cyprus, they dont even know when they can bring it, same happened to my cousin two weeks ago as well, ridiculous management.

### "really small room"
Flew with Wizz Air from Gdansk to Reykjavík. Ok flight, but rude crew members, really small room for your feet (I’m 174cm but still felt really uncomfortable) To end this “fantastic” trip they left our luggage without letting us know about it because the airplane was too heavy. If you have an option of flying with any other company I would really really recommend it from the bottom of my heart.

### "never refunded my money"
Luton to Kutaisi. I purchased my tickets a few months ago. I paid additional money for the transfer bus. Unfortunately my return flights was cancelled and after a massive dispute with the airline staff they refunded my money for the return flight. They never refunded my money for the bus. It makes no sense why would I need the transfer bus if I have no flight. To add to my problems I tried checking in online 48 hours before my flights and was charged additional money for the seat. I was unable to proceed with the checkout unless I paid for the seat. I called their helpline to ask for the refund. I was told that I needed to submit an online claims form. In order to submit a claims form I need to register with Wizz air. Surprise surprise I cannot register with Wizz air to submit my claims form because their system will not recognise my email address which I have had for over 20 years. Please be mindful when you buy your tickets from this airline. Although tickets are cheap it will cost you lots more because of the additional charges.

### "€25 per each hand luggage"
Vilnius to Luton. We fly regularly and often with Wizz. On this occasion we had terrible experience. On flight from Vilnius, we checked in our extra luggage and proceeded to the gate. Once there Wizz staff told us we are not allowed to take our hand luggage on board as we haven't purchased priority. Which we knew, but hand luggage gets collected outside airplane. She was claiming that we had to leave it with our checked in luggage, which wasn't the case, as lady at check in desk asked us to proceed with hand luggage. Therefore we had to pay €25 per each hand luggage in order to board. Very dissapointed, as we fly a lot and perfectly know rules.

### "very helpful and kind throughout"
Not Verified |  This was my first flight with Wizz Air and I have only positive comments to make especially for the crew of the return flights from Krakow to London on the 2nd of January 2019. The flight to Krakow left on time and the boarding process was very straightforward and pleasant. On my return flight from Krakow to London the flight left with a 15 minute delay, however this was due, to the need to de-ice the plane before departure, which was announced by the captain promptly as soon as every passenger was on the plane. Despite the delay we managed to get to London on time without any problems. Like all budget airlines, Wizz Air was limited in offering snacks and drinks, however this is very normal considering the cost of the flight, infact train tickets sometime cost twice as much. But one of the best aspect of the flight were the 4 gems making part of the cabin crew who were very helpful and kind throughout the flight.

### "not enough place to sit"
Budapest to Malaga. I m 1.85. I have not enough place to sit, my knees are touching the front sit. The flight is 1 hour late. On the top of that they try to ask you additional payment for anything: for example the size of the cabin luggage very small. At the end of the day standard companies are cheaper and more comfortable. Worst Landxen airline company ever.

### "unethical practices and policies"
Vienna to Rome. It's a cheap airline so I expected some nickel and diming, but not this kind of unethical behavior. We never received an email for online check in or one that said we would have a 35 euro fee per ticket to print our tickets at the airport. After sorting that out and paying an extra 80 euros, my brother in law was told to take his bag on the plane. He explained multiple times that he had wine in his luggage and couldn't take it through security. They were adamant for him to take it, and of course security stopped him. Then we waited an absurd amount of time to board. The employees were stopping people with a purse and luggage carry on and making them go back to the check in gate and through security. You've got to be kidding! No wonder they were 30 mins late and took way too long to board! They also don't even offer water or pretzels/peanuts on the plane. All paid. The staff are not friendly about it either. We will never fly wizz air again. They have unethical practices and policies.

### "assumed Wizz Air does not have online check in"
Luton to Lisbon. Unfair and dirty money grab practices. At one point, I found myself well ahead of a flight and in the process of checking in. I checked all Wizz Air emails, in which I could not find any check in links, nor did I receive any reminder emails on the matter. I assumed that Wizz Air does not have online check in functionality or it was broken. When at the airport, I got asked to pay the sum of 33 GBP at the airport for failing to online check in. Given the airline's unwillingness to email people about checking in online and having a confusing and poor website UX that does not bring people instantly to the online check in page, reeks to me of a money grab. I reached out to the airline on the matter which not only did not apologize, but also failed to acknowledge any sort of problem and was unwilling to sort this out, which was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.

### "pick any other airline"
Athens to Budapest. Wizz Air wasn't the cheapest but they had the flight with the most appropriate timing for my group on that day. After booking and receiving the itinerary, we received many emails from them, ranging from flash sale offers to baggage allowance changes (this detail is important for later). We got to the check-in counter more than 2 hours before our flight but were told that we had to pay 35 Eur per person because we didn't do our check-in online. Our tickets were only 55 Eur per person, which means the check-in fee is more than half the price of the tickets. Right after being told that I had to do my check-in online or via the app at least 2 hours prior to the flight, I quickly downloaded the app and tried to do my check-in. All I got was an error message saying that due to baggage allowance changes, check-in via the app was no longer possible. While waiting in line to pay for the ridiculous fees, I went through every single email sent to me by Wizz Air; I read every word of the fine prints. There was not a single mention of the fee. When I got back to the hotel, I went through the emails 3 more times, still didn't find anything. I emailed Wizz Air (which btw was a long shot because their website says that they will take up to a month to respond any email and that phone calls to their centers would cost ridiculous amounts, even if you call from within the same country). They responded by saying that I should have read their T&Cs. Here's the thing, their T&Cs is 29 pages long with 16,000 words. So they can send their customers 7 emails advertising their BS but cannot be bothered to warn them of something that is so important. Save your money and pick any other airline with the basic decency and ethics.

### "we could not choose seats"
Oslo to Warsaw. We were 3 people traveling on a weekend trip from Oslo to Warsaw. We bought priority boarding to been able to have an extra small suitcase with us. One week before they sent a mail (out of many), that we now can check in. I tried to check in, but then discovered that we needed to buy a seat, or wait until 48 hours before the flight. We waited, and when we checked in, we could not choose seats. The three of us were placed in seat a and c in one row and the last person somewhere else. When we boarded the plane, of course they have placed a person in the b seat. The same happened on the return flight, even if the plane was far from full. I do not like their way of getting more money out of every ticket. The flight is short 1.5 hours, so it is no problem to sit in a narrow seat with your knees in the seat in front of you. We left in the evening on a cold day in Norway, the plane was full, and every passenger had jacket and pullovers. The crew put the heating system to maximum, i do not know why, maybe to make it uncomfortable for their passengers. They treat us like cattle The only advantage with low cost airlines is the low initial ticket price, next time we will check and compare the total price with other carriers.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
Eindhoven to Varna. I have been travelling with Wizz Air for long time, and have experienced two cancelled flights already. In occasions like this, the airline does not provide the necessary service to support passengers reach the desired destination as soon as possible. In principle, if a flight has been cancelled, the airline should provide the same flight to passenger at the soonest possibility. But  this is not the case with Wizz Air! My flight was cancelled and each passenger had to rebook him/herself the flight for another, already existing one, for which there are any free seats left. This means, some passengers may get to the desired destination in a couple of days, which is ridiculous! Also, for the time until the new flight, the passengers are not offered a full compensation for the accommodation expenses that occurred. In case WIZZ AIR is unable to perform the cancelled flight due to their lack of spare machines and makes people look for which flight there are any free seats left (limitation of their aircraft and service), they should take over all days the passengers are forced to book a hotel for! In my situation particularly: I had to rebook my flight for in 3 day, for a different country, paid two more nights at a hotel, and after this has happened for a second time, I am extremely disappointed with their service! !

### "Never flying Wizz Air again"
Luton to Larnaca. Everything started the wrong way, having us waiting for endless time in the queue 4-5 destinations all together it was a complete mess, miscommunication and unhappy staff, after waiting 30mins on the line I was told that I need to wait 20 more minutes, only to be told that I need to pay £33 because I haven't done my check-in online! I went to pay the fee and I found myself waiting another huge line to pay. My flight was in approximately 40mins and I was still waiting to pay the fine, then when I paid the fine, I went back to the same girl that she dealt with me before because she said to me "go and pay the fine and come back here again, no need for you to queue", only to be asked from another member of the staff to go back to the line and wait like everyone else! Horrible service. I arrived in Larnaca, only to realise after waiting for my bag for 45 mins that all the passenger's backs are left back to Luton! I don't have anything with me. No clothes no nothing, no pc charger no shoes no shirts no with the Christmas presents from my family!! Never flying Wizz Air again.

### "overcharged my family"
Not Verified |  Birmingham to Bucharest. Horrible service at the check desk very impolite they still overcharged my family without any explanation. I bought my tickets from an agency for 3 persons, Wizz priority with seats and everything included. When we reached the airport the person at check in charged me and my family 100 euro extra without any explanation - he didn’t even ask me if I’m willing to pay or if I have money. On top of that the flight was delayed 1 hour and a half so I am really really disappointed in this airline. I don’t think I’ll ever fly with them again

### "Cabin crew were extremely rude"
Flew Wizz Air from Bucharest to Dubai. Worst company I have ever flown with! Cabin crew were extremely rude. Leg room is tiny, toilets were dirty. Their website and app doesn't work properly.

### "avoid flying with them"
Prague to London with Wizz Air. Worst flight experience ever. Flight got delayed 7 hours. Never got any information, water or food. When I asked my flight delay compensation (EU law EC 261) they claimed that the delay was an extraordinary circumstance without giving any reason (= lie). I have then been lodging a complaint and finally won, but it took me so much time/energy. Just avoid flying with them it will be a lot easier!

### "unjustifiable charges"
Larnaca to Budapest. This is the first time I booked a flight with Wizzair due to its "low fares", as I was going fro a very short stay trip. We have been charged additional 35 euros per passenger, at the airport because we didn't check in online. When you book the ticket (and I have booked so many times flight tickets with different companies), there is not any message saying that the self check in online is mandatory. The way of wording for the online check in, is similar to the rest companies as usual saying that :the online check is available two or some days before the flight and if you like you can check in online by yourself to avoid the waiting time at the airport, but nowhere is clearly stating that you must check in by yourself. This is too obvious, that the company is just trying to find ways to earn additional money. It would be way better, to just increase your fares and include the implicit services within the fare. This is the most ridiculous charge I have ever paid to an air company. Other than that, we have been advised that our cabin luggage couldn't been carried onboard the plane to the normal cabin storage place, because we didn't book our ticket with priority boarding and there should be an extra charge if we wanted to take our luggage with us. We have added two 10kg cabin bags along with our tickets, but we couldn't carry them with us because we didn't have priority boarding! Seriously? These unjustifiable charges, in total cost us EUR 94.00 additional to our tickets. Unacceptable.

### "Absolutely dreadful"
Not Verified |  Baggage was lost and we did all in our part in reporting and contacting the airline. While my bag was lost I had to replace all the clothes and that caused an inconvenience as it affected the holiday budget. When the bag was located after 3 months we were told that the bag can be collected from Skopje Airport, Pristina Airport or Luton Airport and no way for it to be delivered to my address, so again i had to pay someone to go to Pristina airport and collect it since it was the cheapest option. Just after it was found i received a response to my original complaint saying that the bad is found and we consider this matter settled. Absolutely dreadful, if i could give 0 stars I would.

### "staff very rude and aggressive"
We travelled back from Lisbon to Luton on Saturday, we paid for 10kg carry on luggage but once we were boarding the staff started pull passenger's out of line and telling them they have to pay more - their luggage was no bigger then another passenger's and the staff were very rude and aggressive. This is the second time I have been witness to this robbery to vulnerable people who are desperate to get home.

### "never travel with them again"
Luton to Katowice. This airline is the worst one and i never will travel again with them. I chose the online check-in however I tried to do it multiple time in the day before and more than 3 hours before and the app told that wasn't available the check In online and i could have that done at the airport free. In the airport they told me that was a system failure but I could send the receipt and the message showed in the system and they would be happy to refund the money. I contacted the costumer service and they were really unpolite and arrogant. They said that they couldn't refund and next time to try another browser or turn it off and on my phone. The email that I received from them they are all very judgmental. I never had a situation like that and definitely never will travel with them again. My flight was 40£ and in the end was 94£.

### "poor judgement or greed"
Brussels Charleroi to Bucharest. Extremely disappointed for a simple reason: I chose online checkin but had no reminder in the pre flight or confirmation email that failing to check in online 3h before departure who lead to a charge of 35 euro at the airport. As a company you have a duty to serve your customers, and to send a reminder a few days before the flight to remind customers to check in online would have been a good idea. I am very upset to have had to pay extra just for checking in, which takes 5 minutes at home, but costs 35 euros at the airport. The price is ridiculously high, unjustifiable for the service, and your failure to remind customers of this extra cost shows poor judgement or greed.

### "Never use this company again"
Tel Aviv to London. Worst flight and services have ever had. Felt like a total rip off. Tried to online Check in 6 hours before the flight and got a system error message. When came to airport was charged 34€! For a late check-in. Never will use this company again. Bad service, on and off ground, no leg space all bad.

### "rude and unprofessional"
Eindhoven to Budapest. I have been traveling for so many years and with so many companies but Wizz Air is the all the way down.I never experienced something like that. Staff is rude and unprofessional. I wish that I had research about them before. Avoid them!

### "Avoid at all cost"
Budapest to Athens. Avoid at all cost. Fine print rules which make you pay ridiculous amount of fees. Flight cost 40 euro, Boarding printing cost: 55 euro. Avoid. Terrible.

### "Worst airline in the globe"
Bucharest to Tel Aviv. Worst airline in the globe. Only one check in desk for 230 passengers. They had us waiting outside the aircraft in the freezing weather for their maintenance problem.

### "£30 to check in at airport"
Not Verified |  Luton to Warsaw. Went with this airline simply because it was cheap. But they had a charge of £30 to check in at airport, and when I was about to board the plane another hidden charge of £23 for a "large" carry on. This more than doubled my ticket price. They did not make any of these charges clear when I booked online, instead offering me a load of useless extras, but not telling me about these extra charges I actually needed to know about. I'll certainly not be flying with this airline again.

### "they forced us to pay £60"
Luton to Budapest. Tried to check in online but the website crashed, so we had no choice but to check in at the airport where they forced us to pay £60 if we wanted to fly. One of the Luton airport staff told us that this was how Wizz air appeared to run their business - massive and unreasonable charges hidden in the small print. We called, but no one picked up. We emailed and after 3 weeks got a reply refusing a refund. Don't risk it.

### "be avoiding this airline"
Tallinn to Luton. An airline that charges you 70 Euros if you don’t board your flight should be warning enough! We failed to check-in online, and were charged a lovely 37 euros each to do so in person, after waiting 30 minutes to pay. We then went back to pick-up our boarding passes, only to be told that our personal items - suitcases within the size range - could not be taken on without purchasing “priority boarding”, or checking them. After another 30 minutes and 50 euros, we finally made it to the gate with no time to spare. This airline cares very little about its customers, and judging by the long line for fees at the airport, they rely heavily on these fees. I would rather know what I am paying for ahead of time, and will be avoiding this airline despite the fact that I travel often and they have many flights from London. I hope others do not make the same mistake and travel with this unethical company!

### "choose any other airline"
Budapest to Thessaloniki. I had to pay 45 Euros extra because I didn't check in online, because I didn't know about their app. After paying to checkin (more than my actual flight cost) I finally made it through security and such. My gate number didn't pop up on the screen until the  moment we were boarding. We all made a mad dash towards our gate, which was the same area as three other planes. Once we make it through, we go down a hallway and outside, looking for the name of our destination. Then they keep us in this little hallway until we're all there. After this, we go down another hallway, this one very outside, and pretty cold. I watched as the old passengers were taken off our plane, their luggage transportive, and then waited even longer for them to clean the plane (I can only hope). I'm not sure why I had to wait outside, and for so long, when the plane wasn't ready for us. This is  the only airline I've ever felt possessed to complain about. It's terrible, choose any other airline.

### "do not allow check in online"
Trying to check in for 24 h before flight online but it said something is wrong. Trying then 3 h before flight, it said check in available in airport only. When I arrive in airport I was report about it. But in airport said you still must paid 35€ and then you can claim money back. When back to UK, contact wizz air customer service, they said that they are haven't any problem in check in system. Wizz Air found randomly that they do not allow check in online, instead they will charge you in airport.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service ever. I’ve never traveled with an airline where their staff care so little for customer service. A huge queue at check in due to two fairly incompetent children being the only staff members on duty. Followed by a €45 surcharge for not checking in online after experiencing faults with the website and I witnessed one of the air stewardess being rather rude to an older lady who politely asked for some help with her hand luggage. Clearly a bad culture stemming from money hungry management and for that I will never fly with them again! To the management of Wizz Air I wish you many unsuccessful and unprofitable years to come!

### "it is a total rip off"
Budapest to Eindhoven. The day before our departure we tried to check in online however after a few steps the website blocked. We tried several times but we never succeeded in performing the check in since the website kept blocking. At Eindhoven airport they were understanding and we had no issues. For the trip back from Budapest to Eindhoven we experienced the same issues with the online check in on their website. No understanding at all at the Budapest airport however. We were treated very rudely and were obliged to pay 45 euros a person for an "Airport Check in". We were 4 people so we had to pay a staggering 180 euros for 2 minutes work by they employee. I can only urge you not to book with Wizz air since it is a total rip off.

### "Just don't do it"
Booked a flight with Wizz Air. The website is designed terribly, I tried twice to check-in online and it failed. The emails I received mentioned nothing of the extreme fee of 55 euros to check in at the airport. I did receive an email saying arrive early the next morning, so I promptly arrived 2.5 hours early to be told I could not enter the check in and to go to the extra charges desk. Note 4.30 in the morning, to be told I could not check in unless I paid 55 euros. The staff were so rude. I witnessed many people being charged outrageous prices for baggage etc.. I then had to queue again to check-in. I made it to my gate B12 to be told I had a stand by ticket, luckily there was one seat left! I was then hassled about my luggage. The guy at the gate wanted to charge me there and then! I guess it was because I was one of the last people to get onto a fully booked flight and he was stuck for time. Worst start to the day ever. Just don't do it.

### "bad value for money"
Today, I had THE worst experience of my life on Wizz Air. I arrived early for boarding so that I could find room for my backpack in the overhead compartment - which I did. I then took my row 'C' aisle seat. After boarding was completed, I was made to remove my backpack by the stewardess and force it under the seat in front of me. My backpack is large, flexible and within Wizz Air's size limits, but placing it there meant that there was no room left for my feet. (See photos). I could not place my feet outside in the corridor area, either as it would have tripped other passengers who were walking and blocked the food trolleys. I had no choice but to place my feet under the metal braces in the seat in front, meaning that every time the passenger in front moved in his seat, my foot would get crushed. By the end of the flight my foot was bruised, and I was in pain, simply because my bag was too large to fit under the seat, and it should have been left in the over head compartment. Upon pointing this to the stewardess who instigated this episode without any consideration of the consequences, she told me to write to Wizz Air and complain, and that there was nothing she could do. It may be that Wizz Air will read this and decide to reply, stating that shortly larger bags, such as the one which I had to remove mine for will not be allowed without an extra fee. However, that is not the point. At the time of my journey, this was allowed, and. Wizz Air provided zero safe foot space. My bag was also too large to fit under the seat in front, and should have stayed in the overhead locker. Additionally, as my bag was too large to fit the seat in front, it was blocking the emergency escape route of the passengers sitting in the window and middle rows. This is dangerous, and I believe against passenger air transport safety rules. There were also a couple of other, issues regarding hygiene. I noticed that the toilets were cleaned by cabin crew, without wearing gloves, using paper towels from inside of the toilets. First the seat was wiped, then the sink and finally the same towel was dropped on the floor and the floor was wiped using the shoes. The stewardess then pick up the papers from the floor using her hands and flushed them down the toilet. After this, and without washing her hand, she walked to the food trolley and started serving food to passengers, touching coffee cups, water bottles, serviettes and sandwich wrappers. This has to be the worst case of hygiene which I have ever come across, and I would not trust any food served on this airline. I also noticed that the headrests on the seats had grease marks on them, as the paper headrests were missing. The Velcro exists to hang the headrests from, but in order to save costs, it seems like Wizz Air have decided not to care about this item either. I have travelled on Wizz Air on numerous occasions in the last 10 years or so (about 10 times this year alone), however the service has reduced dramatically, the prices have any rocketed (they are often more expensive than national carrier National carriers) and the staff's attitude to customers is simply atrocious - possibly due to their fast expansion. Because of a staff members attitude, the poor and dirty hygiene, over crowding, and bad value for money, I will not travel on Wizz any more, and I recommend that you check the prices of other airlines before booking with Wizz Air.

### "Joke of a company"
Luton to Bucharest. Always a pleasure to sit and wait in the airplane for one hour before actually departing. But that's nothing compared to waiting for 12 hours in the airport few years ago courtesy of this lovely company. Thank you wizz air! Joke of a company.

### "Don’t waste your money"
Budapest to Nice. We arrived to the Budapest airport with one checked bag that I had paid online together with the ticket reservation. Upon arriving at the checkin counter, they asked for our boarding passes which I didn’t have since I planned to do it at the counter with the baggage drop-off. They directed me to another counter which turned out to be a counter for extra fees. The guy there mentioned that I was supposed to do the online checkin beforehand so I had to pay 194€ extra fee to the 4 of us. Once we approached the boarding gate, one woman stopped me and asked me to put my hand luggage inside the measurement box. It turned out to be bigger and didn’t fit inside. She then asked me to pay a fee of 75€ extra. I also had a small backpack for my laptop and camera which she said was too much. I said that I would give it to my mom since there were 4 of us. She then stopped us all and forced us to squeeze all our stuffs (even food, clutches for money/passports/boarding passes) inside 4 hand luggage only (including the one I had already paid 75€ for). 3 out of these 4 luggage were to be put to the side of the cargo separate from us since the plane was full. I’m disgusted with how Wizzair treats their customers. In total, 269€ was thrown out of the window for us, buying us nothing but anger and disgust. Don’t waste your money and time.

### "charged 35 Euros to check in"
Not Verified |  Eindhoven to Vienna. They don't indicate anything about paying extra for online checkin when you buy the ticket. I tried to check in online before and after 48hrs but they keep charging me. Then there is a misleading text said that you can check in at the airport but doesn't mention anything about paying. So you have no idea how much you have to pay in total when you buy the ticket. They charged me 35 Euros to check in at the airport, ridiculous. There were other customers who had the same problems as me at the airport. I will never ever fly with Wizz Air again if they don't change their bad services and misleading way of communication.

### "the worst airline experience"
Lviv to Gdansk. My wife and I were charged $86 USD today by Wizz Air in Lviv, Ukraine to print out our boarding passes! This despite upgrading to priority status and trying repeatedly to download our boarding passes on their mobile app and Website. Neither worked! Tried discussing with their customer support, but they were no help. A review of social media shows many complaints about Wizz Air, it's unethical practices and failure to follow up with refunds. We are retired and are very experienced travelers. This is the worst airline experience we've ever had!

### "absolutely useless"
Luton to Larnaca. Do not use this airline. You will end up paying for everything, they charge you for not checking in. We paid for the check in luggage but when we got to the airport we were told that we haven't and they tried charging us. I showed them my bank statement showing the payment being taken then they spoke to their accounts team who confirmed the payment. Customer service at the airport is absolutely disgusting very rude does not have any communication skill what so ever. It seems like they don't enjoy their work and is there for the sake of the money. This was first time I used Wizz Air and will be last time. I will never ever recommend my friends and family to use this airline. Please stay away from this company they are absolutely useless and you will end up paying extra for everything.

### "Extremely poor site and service"
Extremely poor site and service. Experienced a system issue with the Wizz Air site that disallowed me to proceed with an online check without an assigned seat. Tried on various computers/mobile devices and ilnet connection to no avail. It was definitely an issue with the Wizz Air site. Turned up to the airport early to explain this to the Wizz Air customer service desk and still had to form out a 32.50 Gbp fee for a printed ticket. The fee is steep but understandable for those that forget to print their ticket. I feel I should have had the fee waived given my circumstances. Raised an online ticket for refund asking them to check my log data for my login attempts to verify system issue experienced. After no update from Wizz Air I contacted the listed UK number for existing bookings found on their website only to be told I contacted the wrong number. I offered to direct him to he website advising of error and he simply replied "look man, I know that's on the site but this only for people who need assistance". Extremely poor site and service. Take my advice and fly with a different airline. The amount of issues you'll face is not worth the 10 quid you'll save with this mob.

### "long, long waits in the bus"
Budapest to Kiev. Boarding involved long, long waits in the bus to the aircraft, and in accordance to Wizz's new policy hand luggage couldn't be taken into the cabin, but other than these, it was a smooth, pleasant flight with lovely crew.

### "a bunch of cheeky scammers"
Warsaw to Keflavik. A scandal - this is all I can say. WizzAir appeared to be a bunch of cheeky scammers. They produce a really bad app and they will tell you that you need to check in 3hrs before the flight. Then the app will not work (because it's horrible) and they will charge you approx. 100EUR for 2 people for a check in at the airport. It's not about the money - I felt robbed and you never forget these things.

### "What a terrible experience"
Bratislava to Luton. What a terrible experience! Would never use this airline again. Staff unprofessional could not hear announcements including safety ones when this was mentioned to cabin crew she just smiled and walked away! Plane was dirty still had rubbish on floor from previous flight. I Could not wait to land back home and get off, would not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "no one responded 44 days later"
Suceava to Luton. I submitted claim as per Wizzair guidelines and filled online form on 21/08/2018. Automatic response was send same minute but no one responded 44 days later to my claim which is regarding service I paid for and did not receive (company policy states it takes up to 30 days to respond). Called call center on 0330 977 0444 number today asking about update regarding my claim. Answer was "They are very busy". I asked can I speak or call to "Them" answer was no. When I asked can I speak to manager, answer was that managers are not answering phone calls. The customer service contact details are well hidden, I called the contact number provided above but did not get any answers nor advise what should I do next.

### "baggage policy is a joke"
Birmingham to Bucharest . The baggage policy is a joke because they do not check and people bring very large bags on board. The spaces between chairs are way too small to be legal. I do not know how they can operate in legal conditions. I've seen animals travelling in better conditions. None of the pilots speak good English. I never understand what it is the pilots say. The priority boarding is a joke. I will never fly with them again. I have learned my lesson.

### "No benefits whatsoever"
Wizz Air used to be a small airline with nice fares and helpful and friendly staff. They have recently expanded in a short period of time, and I believe this is where the problem lies. I have had 3 errors while making three different bookings in the last 2 months. I travel between university and home approximately every 2 months, and sometimes my family visit so you can imagine, there are a lot of bookings. No benefits whatsoever - no collecting airmiles, no benefits for frequent travellers. You have to buy a membership to get cheaper flights but nothing apart from that. The website is ridiculous. For example, last month (Sept 2018), I used my bank card for a booking and at the end of the transaction, I received an error notification that the bank card did not work and I was instructed to repeat my transaction again. A phone call came and I did not manage to try immediately. 2 minutes later, I receive an email with a summary of my booking because the transaction was actually complete! So luckily, I had not tried a second time. Another example (Sept 2018) is when I tried to add 2 suitcases to an inbound flight. But instead, they were added to the outbound flight! That is 2 suitcases of 20kg, so I am still waiting for my refund of almost £50. No emails from Wizz Air yet. I have travelled with Wizz Air for 5 years now, it used to be an affordable airline, simple way to get from A to B. Now each booking comes with a problem. Each time I am on the website, it feels like I am gambling today. Am I going to end up losing £50 or will everything go well maybe this time? I am a student, so it is really difficult. But I imagine it is the same for anyone.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Worst customer service ever. The information re extra luggage is misleading and false. I added an extra suitcase, checked both ways box, the system clearly showed the charge for both ways (top and calculated in the bottom) and then I got a confirmation email that covers one way only, for 63£! The Call center refused to refund me for the charge and so far, there's no response to my complaint form. I was forced to leave the suitcase at the destination so I wouldn't be charged both ways. The flight went smoothly with no delays and the crew were polite and efficient. Yet, I would expect to receive efficient service when things go off plan and it does not seem that Wizzair are capable of that. If you decide to travel with them, do your homework first. I won't repeat the same mistake again.

### "Appalling customer service"
Not Verified |  Athens to Bucharest. Appalling customer service. Don't be fooled by the apparent great deal you get on your ticket. It will cost you much more in the end: like 30 euros per person for a check in which apparently we started online "but haven't fully completed". Which seems to be a rather common occurrence with this airline.

### "the seat was comfortable"
Luton to Athens. Not a bad experience for a budget airline - way better than Ryanair. I had extra legroom and didn't eat or drink any Wizz food. On the way to Greece a woman asked to sit in an extra legroom seat two seats from me and was allowed to, so maybe it's not necessary to pay extra for that if you travel alone. My only complaints would be: confusion about the baggage allowance meant I worried a lot about whether I could take my small bag on the plane (I was allowed, but according to their rules I should have been fined as I didn't have Priority), and the check-in desk was very slow to open at Athens, so a long queue formed. Otherwise, we boarded on time and the seat was comfortable.

### "strongly recommend avoiding"
Ljubljana to Brussels. Absolutely terrible. Online check-in was unclear and the summary of booking information, which I carefully went through in the morning of my flight, contained no information about it being necessary to avoid a 30€ payment at the airport. I was first given a boarding pass with no problems when I arrived at Ljubljana airport and the boarding to the plane was about to start, as suddenly I was called to information situated outside the security. I was called to pay the 30€ because I had done the check-in at the airport (paper? The 2-second service? ), and given no option to fight back because my flight was about to leave. I was treated like an idiot because I had not figured out that online check-in was needed while apparently having "ticked the box" to agree to do it online while booking. Apparently I would have figured this out by logging into their website. As if I had nothing better to do with my time than browsing their website just for fun. This was my first time with Wizz air and I had no idea this company had all these different ways to trick the customers. They probably make a fortune with the misleading check-in information. I am sure they have received many complaints but there are still no reminders nor links to the check-in sent to the customers. I strongly recommend avoiding, they give you a headache.

### "charged 37 euros to check in"
Tallinn to Luton. I was unable to check in via app, and then was charged 37 euros to check in at the counter. Will not use this airline again, and I do not recommend it.

### "Horrible service, rude staff"
Not Verified |  Flew London Luton to Larnaca. Absolute worst ‘company’ I’ve ever flown with! Charged me and my boyfriend £64 for the pleasure of checking us in at the desk which I’m pretty sure is their job, so why they think it is okay to then charge us so they can push a couple of buttons, I’ll never know! Horrible service, rude staff and just an absolute awful experience! Will never fly with Wizz Air again.

### "most terrible experience"
Berlin to Kiev. The most terrible experience one might have. If you didn’t register online you will pay registration fee at the airport! To register you and print a boarding pass apparently will cost you 35€ per person. Almost half of your ticket price. I guess paper cost so much money that they can’t even give you a discount.

### "pay £30 to check-in"
Flew Wizz Air from Wroclaw to London. Please don’t give them your money. For me it feels like a scam company. You pay £20 for the ticket and then online check-in does not work and you need to pay £30 to check-in at the airport. Should have bought a far better (and in the end cheaper) flight from another company.

### "Would fly Wizz Air again"
Skopje to Berlin. Having read other reviews on this website, I was surprised that my flight with Wizz Air back home was (like the outbound one) flawless: easy booking process, informative app, speedy check-in process, orderly boarding process, aircraft less than one year old, professional crew, affordable inflight food and drinks - you name it! Can also recommend their Limo transfer offered on their website or app. Not their fault, Berlin is not able to get its act together running a decent airport. Baggage delivery in rotten Schönefeld airport (worst airport in Europe let alone of a Western capital) took ages. Would fly Wizz Air again in a heartbeat.

### "pay a little bit extra"
Barcelona to Bucharest. The worst service and flight company ever. The flight was delayed with 1 and half hours without any good reason (the weather was good, other flights were on time). The arrival hour should have been at 2am in the night and they landed at 3am. Before boarding, they changed the gate 3 times. Then, also before boarding, they labeled the cabin luggage randomly and by force: I told them that I want to take with me in the cabin and that it was very small luggage, below the maximum limits for cabin luggage. They didn't care and lied that it will not necessary go to drop off, the flight attendant will hold them only if there will be no more space in the cabin. It was a lie because we were among the first to board and they took the luggage to the drop off. The places for luggage in the cabin were almost empty near our seats, so it was only mockery what they did. Besides that we had to wait at 3:30am half an hour for the luggage. Another problem is that the space in the seat is too small. I have 1.7 meters height and I stood with my knees stuck in the front seat. I cannot imagine how taller persons can fly 3 hours in that tiny place. Conclusion: never, ever flight with this joke of company, they have the absolute worst service I ever experienced. You better pay a little bit extra money and fly with another company, but do not make the mistake to fly with Wizz Air.

### "pleased with my flight"
Larnaca to Katowice. I was pleasantly surprised and very pleased with my flight, the price my son and I got was a great deal. No delays, flight staff pleasant, check in was great! My bag was to be on hold but I asked at larnaca if I could take it on board as I have a bus to catch right away when I get to Poland.The agent was fine with that, leaving Poland was amazing the staff at the airport were friendly and very accommodating! My son paid for priority so he is able to board 1st.We had tried to modify my booking when we booked and it wasn't letting us add the priority for myself. But at the end it didn't matter cause in Poland I asked the employee of wizz Air if I could be with my son in the priority section or line so that I could possibly sit with him. The flight wasn't full, she told me yes u can, she lifted the rope and said it's fine she told the agent in the priority that I was ok to be there. I actually was able to sit with my son too. I will be flying Wizz air again in the future!

### "Absolutely abysmal service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely abysmal service. Travelled with my partner and friend from Luton to Larnaca and return. My friend requires assistance on and off the aircraft. The airport staff were fantastic but the airline insisted that he must sit at the back of the aircraft in a centre seat despite the fact that he had paid priority with an extra leg room seat. The priority boarding at Luton and Larnaca was an absolute insult to intelligence. 5 lanes of check in for standard fare and one lane for priority. The entire flight was checked in before the priority queue had moved. Priority boarding is only priority through the gate and not boarding the aircraft. My friend ended up foregoing any assistance to board the aircraft In order to keep his extra leg room seat as he would have been in a great deal of discomfort over a 4 hour flight. As a business traveller flying around 50 times a year I have never witnessed such poor service. Needless to say I will never fly with Wizz air again and will certainly not recommend them to any of my associates or friends.

### "Appalling customer service"
Luton to Dubai via Katowice. Booked with Wizz Air via Kiwi.com and paid for the 20kg baggage option. Made sure to check the Wizz Air website - their baggage page shows '20kg Paid x 6'. I had less than 20kg worth of baggage - a backpack and a guitar case. Because it was two pieces of luggage, not one, I was charged £61. I submitted a complaint about the unclear website and ridiculous charge, it took them 36 business days to respond. An unsatisfying email conversation later, I still haven't been refunded. They hid behind the fine print. Appalling customer service. Flyers beware of the add-on costs when flying with Wizz Air.

### "I decided no more Wizz Air"
Prague to Luton. Never again. Our flight was cancelled and nobody could tell us what happened and why it is cancelled. We don't know it even now. Communication with this company is terrible - one mail = 2 weeks. They don't want to pay us 250€ compensation despite that's our right. The price is low so is the quality too. You can buy some meal on board for normal airline price but with regard to the staff, they were quite rude. When return flight I asked them "excuse me" because I wanted to go back to sit, she said me rudely "wait I can't now". I decided no more Wizz Air. I pay rather 180€ return ticket via EasyJet than with WizzAir. I'm not the only person who makes complaint about this airline and even not the last.

### "had not checked in online"
Tirana to Budapest. I travelled about a month ago to Albania with Wizz and on my return I was meant to take Wizz to Budapest and Ryanair thereafter to London. The night before flying out I tried to login and check-in online, which of course did not work – so I assumed as I had never needed to complete check-in online on flights from Tirana that it wasn’t a service that was offered. The next day I went to the airport about 3 hours before departure, queued up at the check-in desk, only to be refused a ticket because “I had not checked in online”. I was told in no uncertain terms that unless I paid 35 EUR I would be denied boarding. The fact that their website did not work and that they had not at any stage advised of the need to check in – unlike Ryanair (who emailed and texted me a day before the flight), did not serve any purpose and I was forced to pay. As Wizz doesn’t do customer service, their pathetic attempt to respond to my complaint was left to customer service whose final attempt to look into my complaint said “We would like to kindly inform you that we have done a thorough investigation and we are delighted to inform you about the reason, why you were requested to pay at the airport”. Avoid like the plague!

### "great value for money"
Riga to London Luton. I recommend this airline. Great value for money, cabin crew was really nice, seats comfortable, great selection of food and drinks, on time departure and landing. Would definitely reccomend Wizz Air.

### "ripping off passengers"
Luton to Cluj-Napoca. The company is completely ripping off passengers when it comes to fees for luggage and seats. Most times these costs are higher than the flight itself. You cannot use Club Discount for anyone else but your own fight: for example, I've tried to book a fight for my mother using club discount- guess what?? No can do. And as a passengers there's nothing you can do because they are the only company flying your way, so there's no competition. Staff service there's no complaints from me there, they do they're best with what they have. They've always been professional, polite and very helpful with me.

### "Service on board a mess"
Luton to Bucharest. Service on board was a mess. The staff making the announcements on board was a shame, she was not able to do that because her colleague  was making her to laugh all the time. Just short after landing in OTP a lot of pax were standing up and talking on their phones even we were still moving to the terminal, the cabin crew let them to continue without being firm - disappointing. When the aircraft parked the bins were opened already and bags out. I will not travel anymore with Wizz because of lack of safety.

### "35Euro to get a boarding pass"
Kosiche to Luton. I only booked with Wizz Air because I had no alternative for this journey. I was prompted to check in online with Wizz Air by the company I bought the ticket from. I tried this on several occasions. On 28 August it still hadn’t opened - but when I tried again on 30 August, the day before my flight, it had closed. Apparently it had been open for just one day, on the 29th. At the airport I was charged 35Euro to get a boarding pass because I hadn’t managed to check in online in this one-day window of availability. A blatant effort to rip-off the customer.

### "ashamed of the new lows"
This is regarding the flight from Bucharest to London Luton, scheduled for 3:00pm. At 9am in the morning the same day, the Wizz website had an update on the flight status i.e. it was 1.5 hours late and would depart at 4:30pm now. I had already paid to check-in a 20kg bag along with my ticket. I had checked in online earlier and had to drop off my check-in bag. I reached the check-in desk at 3:00pm. The lady said that they had closed the bag check-in and I should take the bag to the gate directly. So, now I had to get my check-in bag scanned as a hand luggage and all my perfumes, etc were thrown away by the airport authorities. When I reached the gate, the Wizz staff asked me to pay 65 euros to check-in my bag. I clearly said no and she and her colleague would not let me board the flight. According to them, if the flight had been delayed to 9pm, I should have been at the airport by 1pm to check-in the bag. The flight was further delayed to 5pm. I called the Wizz complaints department and asked them for assistance, to which he replied that I should just pay the money for the bag. After having argued with them for half an hour, I had no choice other than to pay! I ended up paying a total of more than 100euros for a 12kg bag to get it from Bucharest to London. My bag was cheaper than that! Wizz should be ashamed of the new lows that they go to, to extract money from passengers.

### "had no choice other than to pay"

### "fun of low cost"
Luton to Bratislava. Cabin crew pleasent with 1 or 2 can't wait to get off. Fast boarding, airport ground crew as rude. Smooth ride, landed early with engine oil leak at park position no info given on delay, let us walk through smoke shooting from engine from rear door that's the perks and fun of low cost. Some meals and drinks at reasonable price. Cheap way of getting from point A to B.

### "Horrible experience"
Budapest to Lisbon. Horrible experience. The Wizz Air terminal in Budapest looks like very old factory or warehouse. We had to wait half an hour to takeoff approval and then when we were rolling on the track suddenly we had to interrupt our landing due to passenger´s sickness. After the emergency left the aircraft all passengers had to identified theirs all personal luggage and bags on the board. After that all checked-in luggage had to be identified and we all had to get out of the plane and find our luggage. After all of this I hoped that crew will provide us some refreshments or snack bud despite all of this fact, we got only one small orange juice and had to fill and sign documents providing that we have accepted this juice as an act of apology. If I asked about more water, the cabin crew told me that I had to pay for it. Then captain spoke to passengers and announced that we have to wait another hour for takeoff approval. Everyone on the board had been totally angry. And the seats were extremely small, uncomfortable and with my height 190cm I was sitting there almost 8 hours instead of 4. I will never ever fly with this airline again.

### "worst flight experience"
Luton to Cluj-Napoca. My worst flight experience ever! Do not bother. I will never use it again. Rude staff, very slow service. Bag 1.5 kg over and is cost £25. Next time I will rather pay £200 extra to fly from Gatwick rather than here. Awful.

### "Very unprofessional"
Flew Wizz Air from Warsaw to Split. Unpleasant surprise at the airport with an additional "welcome" fee. Airline in no way went to inform the PAX, nothing in the email or the ticket - just some fine print in the Terms. Very unprofessional. I wasn't the only one at the counter paying extra $$$, there were others. The whole thing smells like a shakedown. Better value on legacy carriers!

### "had not checked in online"
Sibiu to London. I am writing this review to make others aware of the issues we and several of our wedding anniversary party, went through recently with Wizz Air. Altogether there were over 15 of us traveling with Wizz Air to 2 destinations from Sibiu; Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Luton Airport. We arrived at the airport, most of us, 2 hours before we were to depart. For local airlines this is quite normal. What we did not expect is what happened to all of us and needs to be addressed immediately. We checked in only to be told that we had not "checked in online" 3 or more hours before, so each of us would have to pay an additional 35 EUROS to get a seat. All 15 of us were charged this. This needs to be advertised as a crucial piece of information and not in the small print. I believe this is part of a money-making scheme with the airline and should be addressed. They smiled at us a lot after they told us to go to the counter to pay the additional monies and then when we returned they sort of looked at the scrap of paper and smiled again and said priority queue. There was no such queue.

### "worst customer service"
London to Ljubljana. This is by far the worst customer service airline with the worst staff members I have experienced. If you think it's worth the risk to save some money don't. 40% of this airline's revenue is from administrative fees - they have turned hidden fees into their main business strategy.

### "seats were terrible"
Not Verified |  Budapest to Luton. Terrible. Waited 2 hours in the check-in line. Women that were working were slow and disinterested in trying to assist customers. I tried to check in online however the app and online portal failed to work and after showing proof of this to the staff at check-in I was forced to pay £40 just to check-in. I was moved around from desk to desk with no-one really quite sure of what was going on, they were mindless . The seats were terrible, uncomfortable and incredibly small - yes I did fly economy but gosh I've never experienced that. All in all, i did get from A to B but for the price I paid,  it should have been smooth sailing.

### "do not fly Wizz Air"
Rome to Budapest. Save your self some time and money and do not fly Wizz Air. We waited over half an hour in the check in and baggage drop line to be told that they can't check us in because we didn't check in online. We were told we have to go upstairs and pay an extra €35 per person just to check in. I then waited in line upstairs for over half an hour to be told it was actually €39 per person which may not sound like a lot of money but when it's your last few dollars every cent counts. No where in any email they sent me prior to our flight does it warn you of this at all and we nearly missed out flight because of the messing around. Really unorganised and I will never be flying with WIZZ again.

### "Worst airline ever!"
Worst airline ever! They cancelled my Luton to Larnaca flight in November 2018 without advising me, and when I called them the rep was rude and hung up on me. I had to complain via their website three times before they replied. When I got my refund they withheld £30. Do not use this airline or join their discount club as it's a marketing ploy and you will lose the fee if they cancel your flight. Awful customer service.

### "Second and last time"
Not Verified |  Basel to Budapest. Absolute disaster. From the check in up to the waiting times. Not even Ryanair or EasyJet has such bad delays and so few information. If you want to fly rather think about paying 50CHF more than to fly with this airline. Second and last time.

### "dreadful experience of this airline"
London Luton to Kiev. Arrived at the airport - one hour later informed the flight was cancelled and told to go to Wizz Air counter. Dreadful experience of this airline. Went there to find a long, pyramid-shaped queue. One hour into the queue person behind the counter said that 'if your flight was cancelled there is nothing I can do for you'. Went back home and called Wizz Air next day - the next available flight was cancelled and I opted to get a full ticket refund. To date - and two calls later - the airline claims to have paid the refund into my account, but I can find no record of a payment; airline informs me I have to get a statement from my bank that the funds had not been received. Dreadful time-consuming experience. I will never opt to fly this airline again and will make a point of communicating this displeasure widely.

### "Avoid if possible"
Iasi to Dortmund. I was forced to fly with Wizz Air multiple times, since is one of the few companies that flies to my destination of interest. I don't recall a single time I did not encounter a delay! My latest horrible experience is a 3h 30min delay, in July, in a non air-conditioning airport, with no information whatsoever of when the flight would depart. Moreover, there was no sight of any Wizz Air staff anywhere in the airport. Let's not even talk about their costumer service, nonnexistent. We got a bottle of water after 3 hours, out of pity. Avoid if possible, I would pay 100€ more for any other company, instead of dealing with them.

### "we waited on the floor"
Luton to Athens. Just shocking. Flight delayed because the pilot got on the wrong plane. Waited for 30 mins after the flight was supposed to take off until we were told what was going on. No where to sit in the departure lounge so we waited on the floor.

### "service is very poor"
Tuzla to Cologne. The customer service is very poor. We have been late for more than 1 hour and I lost my connections. I had to check my ticket online, and it didn't work for me, even if I tried a few times. On the flight of course I had to pay extra for the online checkin which was almost 40e.

### "Utter shambles"
Luton to Debrecen. Wizz air never again. Our flight got cancelled and the way they handled the situation was beyond poor. Azzurra handling agency dealing with the re booking or get hotel for the night was just as bad. Utter shambles. Thanks to both company mentioned above we will not attend our friends wedding.

### "helpful cabin crew"
Flew Wizz Air from Katowice to Oslo. Nice and comfortable flight. The flight was on time and arrived on time. Quick boarding and helpful cabin crew. Low-cost means nothing special but also no any problems too. The ticket was very affordable. I recommend this airline while flying to/from Poland.

### "not get my money back"
Budapest to Madrid. Wizz Air flight 2351 on Wednesday, July 18 left 6 hours 28 minutes late. During that time we were on the plane for four hours, during which time a passenger deplaned for "family" reasons, an extensive security check was done on belongings in the plane, more passengers wanted to deplane (apparently scared by the extensive security check) and then everyone had to deplane. We were hardly instructed on where to go on the way back to the terminal, "go up the stairs", and given no prior instructions on how re-boarding was to take place. In the commotion, five passengers, including me were left stranded in Budapest. For Wizz Air, we were automatically to be blamed, and had to pay for a new ticket if we wanted to reschedule. Perhaps the smart passengers stayed standing in front of the departure screens, but I was told that the plane was expected to take off at 11 PM. After missing dinner and not drinking for hours, I needed to sit down and try to cancel my Madrid hostel reservation online. Then much earlier than expected I heard an announcement. That was the only boarding announcement although two authorized agents stated that "many" were given. It didn't look like any information was given on the screens. The five that took a few minutes more to respond to the announcement could not pass a barrier that was no longer successful in reading boarding passes. There were no agents around that could help. Looking everywhere we asked an orange-clad worker to find someone who after his second call on his cell phone told us we were lucky, that we just had to wait right there at that spot because the airline had to change the crew. But, alas, nobody came for us. Then, to add insult to injury, we were told we had to pay again to reschedule. The other four did that. I refused and tried making all contacts possible to ask them to reconsider. After all, I would have expected that would be the correct thing to do. At this point I have plenty of reason to believe that I will not get my money back, like many before me. If I do, it may only be because I paid with a credit card and my credit card company comes through to protect me. No way I would ever recommend this airline. I never thought I could ever be treated in this way, by an airline or by any company.

### "never flying Wizz Air again"
Just got my flight from Budapest to Bucharest cancelled for the reason that the Aircraft had technical problems. Actually, another Aircraft that was supposed to fly from Budapest to Moscow has encountered technical issues and they just switched the aircraft's between them and cancelled the flight to Bucharest after 4hours of simultaneous delays. We've been given in the airport a less than 10€ voucher (2400HUF) and we've been told we could take next flight which it will be in 4 days. Every single experience with Wizz Air was horrible, but this time was beyond every limit of consideration. So, definitely never flying with Wizz Air again (or trying to fly)!

### "Service is a disaster"
Geneve to Sofia.They know their plane is late 3 hours at 12 and inform the people at the schedule time to take off. Result people spend 5 hours at the airport. When you want them a remark about it, they send you to hell. Price is more expensive than Lufthansa for similar route. Service is a disaster.

### "Is not a reliable company"
Cluj-napoca to Treviso. They don't respect the time tables, when we flew from Cluj to Treviso airport we had a delay more than 2 hours, and they said that it was a problem with the previous flight, now we are flying back from Treviso and we have a delay of 3 hours, they don't tell us nothing, don't give anything, and we lost all our bus connections. Is not a reliable company.

### "totally rubbish"
Timisoara to Luton. Customer service is totally rubbish and your allowed a 10kg hand luggage bag but can’t take it on the plane with you because you didn’t get wizz priority at the time of booking. It is not explained when booking the flight and totally inconvenient. Apparently your hand luggage is not guaranteed in the cabin but don’t state why there not guaranteed. And you can buy wizz priority at there desk just before you board the plane, but it’s not €5 like it was at the time of booking, It’s now €37 or you have to leave your bag there and collect it at your arrival destination like you would as if your collecting your normal baggage.

### "experience is worse and worse"
Prague to Keflavik. I currently live in Iceland, so I travel a lot and always with Wizz. Every time I fly the experience is worse and worse so I finally decided to write a review. Price is far too high for low fare and once you look up for a certain flight, every time you look at it, it is more expensive. Not talking about overpriced baggage or if you travel with someone they will never let you sit next to each other even when half the plane is empty. Stewards are rude. Planes are usually dirty from the previous flight. If there is another low fare option in the market I would not go with Wizz anymore.

### "I missed my flight"
Budapest to Barcelona. I was travelling on my own, early in the morning. I gave myself plenty of time to get through to boarding. By the time I reached the front of the queue over an hour had past and I was frightened. This was my first time travelling alone and no one seemed willing to help me, even if I was pleading with them, tears dropping onto their desks as others shoved me aside. It was chaotic and frightening. I asked for help but all the staff were impatient and vague. I missed my flight and none of the staff helped me.

### "cowboy outfit par excellence"
Recently took a Wizz flight from Luton to Bucharest in Romania, not an enjoyable experience. Paid extra to take a suitcase, paid extra to reserve seats, paid extra to get priority boarding as my wife had a temporary mobility problem. Also checked in on line to ensure a trouble free departure and booked our cab to arrive early so we could get through and enjoy a coffee while we waited for departure. So you would thing I did everything right? How wrong was I! On arrival at the Wizz Air check in, the queue was several hundred passengers deep, I pointed out to an official that all we needed to do was check in 1 bag "join the queue" was the terse reply. 55 minutes later, we finally arrived at the check in to be told that our on line check in did not apply, and we had to go the whole procedure again. Wizz Air did not have have enough staff at the check in counters. While 12 desks were "open" only 6 were manned....absolutely pathetic service. The end result was a rush to the departure gate, only to find that everyone was "herded" into a departure lounge that had seating for less than 10% of passengers. Priority boarding passengers were lined up outside the terminal and had to wait in the hot sun (it was an unusually warm English day) while the delayed incoming aircraft was refueled, resulting in several having to force their way back through the queue to get some shade. Altogether a complete shambles. What about the flight I hear you say! The cabin crew were awesome, friendly and helpful. The flight itself was what you would expect from a budget airline, skinny back uncomfortable seats, no in flight entertainment despite a 3 hour flight and of course you have to pay extra for all food and drink. All is not lost though! Christmas is on the way and my grandson wants a cowboy outfit and I intend to buy him Wizz Air, a cowboy outfit par excellence! ​​​​​​​​​​

### "not travel with this airline again"
Aged 84 and 89 respectively we had the unfortunate pleasure of the worst flight in our experience. First delayed by almost three hours and then called from the lounge to stand on embarkation stairs for well over an hour in intense heat waiting to board when it was obvious the plane was not ready as the original passengers and luggage had not been disembarked. This was followed by a 'flight from hell' with a large family aboard intent on just drinking, with two of their obviously worse for drink ladies consistently drinking and creating havoc, making a misery for everyone close and extremely unhappy. This went on the entire flight. To make matters worse the staff served them alcohol the entire trip obviously the company's policy to increase revenue. So much for strict airline policy on drunken behaviour on planes. The return trip to Luton as a couple we were given separate seats, although there were spare seats available, obviously their object to get extra cash by expecting an additional payment for the privilege of sitting together, which after 63 years of marriage, on principal we would not do. We only travelled with Wizz Air as it was part of a package, but in the future I will make sure we do not travel with this airline again.

### "Horrible customer service"
Flew Wizz Air from Budapest to Sarajevo. Horrible customer service, poor organisation and shoddy explanations for all delays. Worse than Ryanair and thats saying something. Delayed flights and poor ground staff who spent the entire time laughing amongst themselves.

### "Appalling customer service"
Luton to Larnaca. Appalling customer service. Upon making the initial booking, the check in didn’t include my middle name on the boarding pass. I’m aware this can be quite problematic, as it doesn’t match my passport, so I called ahead to get this resolved. After waiting a substantial amount of time, the first operator put the phone down “by mistake.” The second updated the details but he made a huge typo, despite the characters in question are on the opposite ends of the keyboard and sound nothing alike - K for Kilo isn’t even remotely close to A for alpha. All in all, it took nearly 2 hours to resolve the issue. I’ve also checked in online for the return journey, as I wanted to sit beside my wife and the random seat generator sat us as far away as possible in order to force us to use the upselling option. I called to see if I could actually get this rectified and if need be, upgrade but the agent was so rude and smug, I actually got off the phone in a bad mood and decided against the upgrade. I won’t be using this budget airline ever again, as I’d rather pay more and receive competent and friendly customer service.

### "attitude is disrespectful"
Not Verified |  Luton to Wrocław. Wizz air website/booking system is awkward to use. Their attitude towards customers is disrespectful, with persistent attempts to increase the price after booking (pay to choose seats, deliberately splitting couples up on seat allocation, not being able to check in until 48 hours before departure - it took nearly 2 hours to enter passenger info and print boarding cards (this can be done well in advance on other airlines), having to put cabin baggage in the hold etc). The flights both ran on time, but legroom was the worst I have have experienced from any of the other low quality carriers.

### "Everything was OK"
Agadir to Budapest. Everything was OK. Smooth. Staff were nice and helpful. Excellent price. Only one thing should be better - more space for legs. Thank you Wizz.

### "no flight without delay"
Lviv to London. Since we got our direct line of Wizz Air from London to Lviv from 1st May 2018 there has been no flight without delay to go and return. Minimum is half hour to maximum of 6.5 hours (known to me). Otherwise plane is ok-ish, cabin crew very nice and friendly both ways. Food and snacks average.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Vienna to Rome. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. Here are 3 reasons why: 1) They Charge you for everything. I mean everything. If you don’t have checkin completed before you get to the airport it costs $40 to get one there so you can fly (not an exaggeration). Printing the little piece of paper costs literally as much as the airplane ticket. In addition, there website is so sneaky and tricky that they won’t send an email asking you to confirm or anything. They will make it incredible you difficult to do so they can steal some more money. I had 5 different flights on this trip from several airlines and this was the only one I could not figure out how to check in and spend $40 on that. Also expect to get charged extra if you have any extra bags at all: purse, hand bag, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if you got charged for entering the plane with gum in your mouth. 2) Staff will treat you poorly. Aside from being charged for everything and nit pick on everything; there is no management in the building to talk to if you have an issue b/c the company is so small they have to hire an outside source at the airport. The staff treats you like criminals checking everything and looking for any little thing they can charge you with. From there you’ll be driven on a bus shuttle to the plane. Literally they are some stingy that you have to sit in the back of the bus if you are not priority. This doesn’t even matter, but it’s just that type of scroungy feel to the whole experience that makes it misserable. 3) They delayed the flight twice overall. I’ve flown about probably 10 or 15 times to places all over the world. I have had some great ones and some rough ones, but this is by far the worst. I will probably never fly with Wizz Air again and I encourage anyone else reading this review to do the same. Pay a little extra because it will literally cost the same amount or less in the end anyway. Plus you’ll be able to at least carry one carry on safely with you to the airport.

### "Boarding was quick"
Riga to Luton. I was surprised by the flight and both departure and arrival process. Check in at Riga was swift and quick. May be I was lucky that I had read the booking information reference cabin baggage allowances and knew what to expect. The staff do check bag sizes and weights but that is a standard with most airlines now. Boarding was quick, the slight delay due to a crew change took a matter of minutes. The cabin was clean. On board service was slick and the deals on offer meant you could make some good savings. Arrival at Luton the disembarking was quick.

### "same delay on both flights"
Flying from Budapest to Rome, at the gate showing 20 min delay, finally ended up being 50 min. Same on our way back, incredible! Same thing happened a year ago, last time I flew with Wizz, return flight Budapest to Reykjavik. It is just not possible to have the same delay on both flights by accident.

### "What's not to like?"
Had read very bad reviews for Wizz Air so was not expecting much. Ordered the most expensive ticket with priority booking, hold luggage, selected seat and guaranteed hand luggage for €34. I can't even get half a taxi journey between Arlanda and Stockholm for the same price. So for me it was like option pricing. Downloaded the app. Entered my booking code and the whole checking in process worked perfectly. Luggage check-in took 30 secs - no queues. No buses at Vilnius. Plane was clean, baguette, bottle of wine and peanuts for €8. Hostesses were efficient and friendly. What's not to like?

### "Avoid at all costs"
Athens to Luton. Terrible boarding process. They show boarding at least 30 minutes before actually boarding a single person. Then only had one person checking boarding cards. Terrible experience which I will pay to avoid in the future (with another airline). The 'priority' boarding only gets you on the bus first too! So probably last on the plane. Seats are uncomfortable too. Avoid at all costs.

### "nothing to accommodate me"
Stansted to Budapest. If I could give no stars, I would. The worst airline company I have ever encountered. My flight to Budapest was cancelled and they had no other flights they could get me on to until around 36 hours later. When I asked for them to refund the hotel, train, and other flight I would now miss due to their inability to operate an airline, they refused. They told me I could "try" to get my travel to the airport refunded on their website. They said that it was my fault the other places would not refund me. The best part of it all was that they canceled the flight as I was going through security at the airport. It is obviously out of my control that my flight was canceled and Wizz Air did nothing to accommodate me. Awful and unprofessional company.

### "avoid them at all costs"
Luton to Tirana. I want to start off by saying that I am not a picky flyer. If an airline takes me from point a to point b safely, then I am satisfied. With this in mind, I never thought I would have such a dreadful experience with an airline. On the first leg from Tirana to Luton, I tried to check in via the Wizz Air app, however it explicitly said that I could not check in online due to regulations from Tirana's airport. I went to the check in counter the day of the flight and I was harshly told by a Wizz Air employee to pay the charge or leave the airport, even though I was clearly explaining to them that checking in online was purely impossible- they refused to listen. The first absolute scam from this airline. The second leg was an even more dreadful experience. Before boarding a woman started interrogating all passengers like she was a prison warden about the number of carry on bags they had. I was fine, however there were people who were forced to pay cash on the counter, just for carrying a lap top in their hands. Second absolute scam. The flight was supposed to take off at 6 a.m UK time, but it took off at 7:30 a.m. The reason was "a missing oxygen bottle" which had to be delivered from Gatwick Airport. To add to the misery, we were left to wait not even inside the terminal, but in the stairs leading to the tarmac, for about an hour. The air was humid and I started having difficulty breathing. Many older people had to lie down on the ground, and many children started getting ill. It seemed like a scene from an apocalyptic movie - at 6 a.m on a Tuesday morning in London! The flight itself was alright. I want to point out that the captain of the flight, an Irish gentleman, fully deserved the title as he apologised profusely on behalf of a ridiculous airline. Nothing but respect for him. Every single other Wizz Air employee, particularly the ground crew needs to take some lessons not just on their jobs, but also on basic human decency. I would give this airline a 0 if I could. Please avoid them at all costs.

### "one of the worst flights"
Dortmund to Belgrade. I have to say this has to be one of the worst flights I've ever had. Wizz air is bad on the ground even worse in the sky. The plane was not too old but it was filthy. No leg room and ground staff was terrible. The crew was polite but disinterested. Wizzair does not send email notification for online check in, however if you don't check in online they will charge you 35 euros. They asked me at check in to remove 600 grams from my check in luggage and put in my hand luggage. I will never use their service again.

### "This is Wizz air"
Athens to Luton. This airline did not allow all customers to print boarding pass button and they charged 30 euros for all the passengers. If you are flying with Wizz air, please prepare extra euros. I can't really understand still. The flight attendant said "This is Wizz air" - awesome.

### "can't even do time management"
Luton to Prague with Wizz air. On the way out there they got us all on the plane. Pilot announced 20 minute delay. Then we continued to sit on the plane for 90 minutes. Staff didn't seem to know what was going on, there were no other announcements. No apologies, nothing. We tweeted Wizz air asking for an update and they sent us a link to a website that said our planes original take off time? Helpful- I think not. Pilot then tells the crew we are taking off still no apologies, no reason given but we did actually take off. The worst part was we had a late night flight and were meant to arrive at around 9.30pm. We landed just before 11.30pm and our check-in for our apartment stops at midnight. So we abandoned our original transfers to get a taxi so that we could arrive with 5 minutes to spare otherwise we'd have had to sleep on the street. We thought this might be a one off. But no. Flight home they got us all boarded onto the buses to go to the plane and then kept us there for an hour and a half, the website did actually say delays but then didn't update when it was delayed a further hour. We finally got to the plane and took off quite quickly this time. We landed home two hours late and our parking had expired. But at least on the way home they did finally apologize when we landed and said the 'airspace was busy' for two hours? Don't fly with them, they can't even do time management and it's not worth the late check-in fees and overstay in the carpark, works out as much as flying with easyJet.

### "charged for a tablet in my pocket "
Extremely rude and deceiving personnel at Doncaster/Sheffield airport, charged for a tablet in my pocket as an extra luggage, even though I was told during check-in that I won't be charged extra, they decided to rip me off during boarding to plane. The female who charged me didn't want to tell me her name. Extremely rude and incompetent.

### "they did not care"
Luton to Athens. I am disabled and had booked customer assistance but on arrival I sat and waited and waited and waited. I asked staff many times if someone was coming and they said yes. Then they sent me off with a man who turned out to be a bus driver. I had a bad fall when he suddenly drove off while I was standing in a big empty space in the bus (only a few seats and designed for people to stand) before I had sat down. I could not get up and lay for 20 minutes on the floor, until someone can to help. I hurt my knee, I called them from the floor of the bus begging for help to get passenger assistance to come and they just kept saying what do you want us to do, you already flew, they did not care. I had a terrible miserable time in pain these days and the passenger assistance boss at Athens tells me that they did come but the Wizz crew denied anyone on board was disabled and needed help. Then I have been ringing them everyday as all of a sudden I cannot check in on line and they just say pay €30 at the airport, no help at all worth whatever is wrong with my booking. They just do not care. A nightmare company.

### "uncomfortable to sit"
Milan to Skopje. Wizzair is the worst company I had to fly with. I didn't expect a lot from a low cost company, but from now on I would rather spent more money to get full service than this. The seats can't go down and there's small space for legs so it was pretty uncomfortable to sit there for 2 hours.

### "Beware of this company"
❌ Not Verified |  Luton to Prague. Wizz Air had us waiting at the airport for over 4 hours then cancelled the flight. They had us wait in line to discuss how to get a refund for another 2 hours and just gave us a page saying we need to rebook on our own, re-pay, then seek a refund at a later date via email. I have done all that and they confirmed a refund and promised they would deposit in my bank account. That was months ago. They won't deposit the refund they promised and they no longer answer my email asking what's the status of my refund. Beware of this company. They are not honest. If they cheat their customers, I wonder what else they cheat on?

### "Worst flight experience ever!"
Sibiu to Dortmund. Never met such arrogance by any other crew in any other company. The app didn’t work so I couldn’t check in an extra luggage - a really small backpack. So I had to do it on sight. The worker there was from the start very arrogant and she booked us the luggage for the amount of 30 Euro just to find out afterwards that the real price was 65 Euro in case we had liquids inside our bag, an amount we weren’t willing to pay. So we asked our money back, her colleague (also very arrogant from the start) told us it’s not possible anymore. The guy started to shout at me and to threaten that we would not be allowed to fly back home if we kept pushing. Unbelievable! So we had payed 30 Euro for nothing just because the staff of Wizzair can not do its job professionally. Worst flight experience ever! Never gonna fly with Wizzair again!

### "Absolutely appalling service"
Cluj to Luton. Absolutely appalling service - unable to check in online due to the app not being functional, then unable to explain to staff at the airport, as no one from Wizz Air is employed at Cluj Airport. Therefore, I had to pay their extortionate fees for airport check-in, as no one at the airport was prepared to accept that the app had not been working. The flight itself was average. Uncomfortable, cramped seats, overcrowded (my cabin bag had to go into the hold), and really not that cheap for a budget airport. Ground service was minimal and sullen, while cabin staff were professional, but forced to constantly try to sell drinks and duty free, making it hard to relax and get to sleep on the flight. Will avoid this airline like the plague from now on.

### "incredibly condescending"
Bucharest to Gatwick. I wish I could give it 0 stars because it doesn't deserve 1 star. This is the worst airline we have ever flown with. In the past 6 months, I have had one flight delayed by 3h, one flight cancelled within 1h of departure with no explanation and with alternative flights offered 2 days later. Like we have not got jobs to go to. I have complained directly to them to claim the european inconvenience payment of €400 per person and they claimed 'extraordinary circumstances' in both situations. We went through a law firm and they managed to get our payment for both cases. Recently, they have also changed the luggage on board rules and supposedly, they take all small hand suitcases to hold. We boarded the plane among the first 10 people and our suitcase was taken to hold. There were at least 30 suitcases (we counted, and we stopped counting after a while) which were taken on board after we boarded. So what is this s#1t? If only a certain number of suitcases are allowed on board, why don't they offer to allow people to check their hand luggage in advance? The staff have always been incredibly condescending and there seems to be a lack of training across the company as we have always been given contradicting explanations for the concerns we have raised. They really need to get their act together. I'd definitely recommend paying a little bit more to buy a flight with any other airline.

### "very nice flight"
Oslo to Skopje. It was very nice flight. The crew was friendly, ground service too, they allowed us to check-in our hand luggage for free. The return flight was delayed for around 45 minutes, but we landed 10 minutes after sheduled.

### "€35 to check in"
Tirana to Luton. Worst experience ever. I have been flying with many airlines but Wizz Air is the worst I have ever experienced. Got charged €35 to check in even though their website didn’t let me check in online and has the rudest staff on board I have ever come across. Was the first time I booked and it will be the last one I will ever use them.

### "the most stressful airline"
Copenhagen to Sofia. Wizz air will make you pay 10x more. The seats uncomfortable as hell and we didnt have any place to put our hand luggage. We thought cool is cheap but on the airport they made us pay 174€ for nothing. Literally the most stressful airline. We almost lost our plane because they were complaining for hours making us pay more and more.

### "grumpy and aggressive staff"
Luton to Timisoara. Horrible experience, grumpy and aggressive staff, a lot of inconsistent information. I don't understand why do they even bother emailing me if all the info stated in the email will be contradicted at a later point by the airport staff. I do not recommend them at all!

### "customer service is the worst"
I flew with Wizzair from Cluj-Napoca to Luton and it was at the Cluj airport two passengers had some luggage problem at the boarding gate and a member of the staff was dealing with this while two others proceeded with the boarding. He started saying to the customers: “ if you are not done sorting your luggage in 30 seconds you are not flying today!” And this sort of threat was repeated a few more times and not in a nice way. Their customer service is the worst I’ve seen in an airline company. It also happened so many times for the flight attendants don’t smile at the customers and some don’t even make eye contact with the customers when they are asked something. Not all of them do their job as bad, some are very pleasant and professional. But I flew often enough (around 20 times in the last year) to notice that it’s a pattern, it happens too often.

### Wizz Air customer review
I've flown with Wizz Air many times, usually between Liverpool and Gdansk, and always been very happy with them. Website and mobile app work fine, and the flights are almost always on time and no hassle. Definitely one of the better budget airlines.

### "the worst experience ever"
Warsaw to Tel Aviv. This was the worst experience ever. I fly with low cost airlines but this was the worst ever. First the line for check in was never ending and reason was due to their policy to try and charge everyone with every possible extra. It also resulted in a delay in departure. No matter what you do they will find a way to charge you. On the plane itself the chairs cannot be reclined at all. You want a glass of water, forget about it , you must buy a bottle. I wrote to WIzzair customer service and received an answer that is defending their policy. If possible I would not fly with this terrible company in the future.

### "the worst experience"
Budapest to Barcelona. This was the worst experience. At check in i paid for the express service called Wizz Express priority pass, at that point i was told the luggage i have can be taken with me on the plane. At boarding we were greeted by staff which seemed to inspect each and every travelers carry on luggage by having them put it in a compartment to measure and if it doesn't fit they force you to pay 70 euro to have it checked in. My luggage did fit and i continued to hand over by boarding pass & head outside to the plane. A moment later he tells the guy at the counter not to take my pass & calls me back and says go pay 70 euro to check in your luggage. I explained look how it fits, after 5 minutes trying to get an understanding he pulls out a tape measure and claims that the height is almost a half of centimeter too tall. To sum it all up after explaining him what i paid for he told me to dispute the charge i have paid for in the airport. He sent me to pay the 70 euro.

### "pay for any seat on the plane"
Budapest to Bucharest. Our difficulties started long before we went to the airport. I noticed at home when I reviewed our ticketing information was that no seats were assigned. So I went online and discovered that to select seats you had to pay for any seat on the plane. Since it was only a bit over an hour flight we decided to let them randomly select our seats even if the three of us, including our 12 year old daughter, were not seated together. A few days before the flight I again went online and attempted to check in. The first section of check-in covered two items: the need to pay to have even one bag checked in (at the rate of $50 per bag) and their rule that there was no guarantee that you could even take one carry-on unless you were willing to pay $6 Euros per passenger for a pass - which supposedly also allowed you to board early. Since we had three bags to check-in and three bags to carry-on I paid over $170 online in order to avoid paying a higher price (as noted in the online check out info) at the airport. The next section of the online check in asked me to select our seats - again at a price. Already upset at the outrageous check-in bag cost I opted not to select a seat and the web site booted me out. I assumed I would just check-in at the airport counter and find out what seats were assigned to us by the airlines. Imagine our surprise when we were informed by the clerk at the counter that we had failed to complete the check-in process and therefore he could not issue tickets. He directed us to another Wizz Air counter down the hall where we were told that our failure to complete the online check-in process would cost us 40 Euro per passenger (120 Euros total) - we had no other option but to pay the 120 Euros. We then returned to the ticket counter and finished checking in. When we arrived at the gate we discovered that the $6 Euro pass we had purchased for each of us allowed us to board early - ya, right, on the bus which then took us to the plane. We stood in the bus for over 30 minutes waiting to be taken to the plane. Once the bus arrived it was a mad house getting off the bus and trying to board the plane. We noticed that most of the other passengers had brought not one but two carry-ons with them. We could have avoided paying the $50/bag cost of checking in our three bags. Nothing but scams on the Wizz Air website. When we arrived in Bucharest we discovered that our large checked-in bag had one of its four wheels removed. We filed a damage claim and are waiting for the results of that request.

### "Please do better than this"
Sofia to Copenhagen. I am travelling light with no luggage as i prefer not to wait at the luggage belt after landing. I have been trying to check in 5-6 times online from different devices and got an error every time meeting a 404 page/ page does not exist. When checking in in the airport I was charged because of this which is totally wizz air problem. Moreover, when waiting to get on the plane a blue tag was put on my hand luggage with a comment about that this was required. When entering the plane the the bag was taken away and put in the luggage compartment in the back of the plane. This is unacceptable as laptop electronic devices etc was in this back. I had to take these out to bring them into the plane without any protection. Please do better than this and follow your own set of rules

### "technical problem in software"
Brussels to Skopje. Printing boarding passes without seat reservation for outbound flight is not possible. This is due to a technical problem in the Wizz Air software for “check-in” (clicking on the button “check-in”, my display gets darkened without any message and nothing happens anymore). I created a complaint  because I had to pay 75€ fee at the Brussels Charleroi. Wizz Air answered "that the page www.wizzair.com works properly and is constantly monitored by Wizz Air IT department and we have not recently made a note of irregularities and they did not accept my complaint. I think there is indeed no problem with printing boarding passes when you take a seat reservation and you when you pay for it (but this is not possible).

### "without info and rude manners"
Sofia to Barcelona, this was the usual Wizz Air story. First the "print yourself boarding card" or otherwise you pay 30€/person and way! Of course that's not told til you purchase the ticket. They know many people won't have a printer in hand or simply will not know so. Unfortunately for them now they had to offer online checking instead, but they make you regret of it as you have to work feeling endless camps (only left asking where our mothers work for each passenger). I avoided that but then comes the flight. Flight got delayed as when boarding people was unboarded without info and rude manners on some ground personnel. In the end over 2 hours delay due to technical problems (but it could be whatever) When boarding with our baby (9 months) although we carry a Yoyo/Baby Grace babycar and its specifically for flying on cabin (that's why we bought it and even in other lowcost never posed problems) after a long discussion they made us to put it down as usual luggage. The senior cabin crew didn't have any idea of her job about this. Sits can not be bended even 1cm. But I will be fair and say I had other low cost with less space for legs (which doesnt mean here you had more than just enough to survive being 185cm. No Wizz Air if you don't have any other choice (it was our case).

### "space to spread out"
Poznan to Luton. A 6.30 am flight from Poznan, which was not full. Check and Boarding was good. Plenty of space to spread out. All bags brought on board were stowed quickly. The flight was the usual low cost that lasted less than 2 hours. The cabin crew was efficient and there was no hard selling of services and products. Arrival in Luton was OK and the bags were slow to emerge onto the belt. Spent 30 minutes after passport control waiting for them.

### "the normal bus like service"
Luton to Katowice. Wizz air check in efficient, priority boarding worked well. However the flight was very full and the usual overhead locker rage happened as to many cabin bags came on board. The gate staff did not enforce airline policy. This delayed the departure by around 20 minutes. Other than that the flight was the normal bus like service. Air hostess were pleasant and professional. Arriving in Poland was straight forward and bags soon appeared.

### "don't remember a flight on time"
Budapest to Luton. While on holiday I got an automated text from Wizz Air saying my flight had been changed and I would have got an email with my new flight details. There was no email, and my account showed I was still on the same flight. Looking on Facebook, a lot of people had this issue and Wizz Air admitted (on Facebook, where not many people would check) that the text was sent in error. This is after lots of people (according to their comments on Facebook) spent lots of money calling their premium number to check what happened to their flight (many waiting upwards of half an hour and many not even getting through!). I do wonder if that text was to encourage people to call the premium number for some extra revenue. My plane was the one I booked, albeit an hour late. As usual, Priority passengers had their passports checked and were allowed down to the shuttle bus to the plane. All other passengers (including me) were next. I was on the same bus as the Priority passengers (who were separated from us with a red cordon on the bus) and there were a few other buses behind us also going from the gate to the plane. We waited, standing, on the bus for over half an hour before it took us to the plane. What's worse (not for me, but for the Priority passengers) is the other buses left before us so ours actually got to the plane second last! Priority were the first to the bus and amongst the last on the plane. Aside from being fast-tracked through security at Budapest (which had no queue anyway), I saw no evidence of Priority adding anything. Once on the plane, staff were nice and obliging, and the plane was clean. Food is expensive but you can bring your own from the airport. Tea is 2.5 Euros but you can ask for extra hot water for free. The pilot gave detailed information on the route and weather. The boarding process is very painful and I don't remember a single Wizz Air flight being on time (and I have flown with them several times). However, their tickets are the cheapest out there, this is the reason I will keep using them.

### "seems as if this is a scam"
I was caught by WizzAir's online check-in scam. I was charged 140 euro for my family to check in at the airport. I was not sent an email providing me with a link to check-in online or instructions on how to do it. I showed all of the emails that the airline sent me to the staff at the check-in counter and they confirmed that this was not sent to me. I was told by the staff that I actually needed their app to check in. This was not communicated when I bought the ticket. This wasn't just a problem with my family, as there was at least 17 other passengers on my flight who also had to pay the 35 euro per passenger fee to check-in. It seems as if this is a scam: tell passengers that they need to check-in online but providing them without a way to do so without using their app.

### "Wizz Air experience was extremely positive"
Flew Wizz Air from Malmo to Skopje. Conducted some prior research and frankly the reviews were indifferent. Modest expectations were soon dispelled and my (single) Wizz Air experience was extremely positive. Checkin at Malmo was efficient and polite (more so than many full service legacy carriers), the flight was great, immaculately presented new aircraft. Of particular note however was presentation, training and competence of the flight crew. The linquistic skills of one of the crew was extraordinary. This lady was able to communicate perfectly in English, Swedish and Macedonian. When the passenger sitting next to me was speaking a 4th language she asked his language then switched to Bulgarian without missing a step, importantly, with a smile. At the risk of drawing a conclusion from a sample of one, very impressed. Does Wizz pass the would I fly with them again test - yes. From my single experience, Wizz offered a better service standard and customer experience than some of the legacy carriers of which I am a "valued premium customer".

### "laughing and talking so loudly"
I flew on a morning flight at 6.15 from Riga to Doncaster on 25th of March 2018 with Wizz Air. My seat was in the back of the plane. It was first time I have fallen asleep on an airplane, thank goodness because I am terrified of flying. But, something woke me up in the middle of the flight - cabin crew were in the back of the plane laughing and talking so loudly, including using bad language. I have flown with Wizz Air a few times now but this was the first time I've seen something like this. I do not want to spend my flight in a loud environment caused by the cabin crew.

### "A total scam"
Flew Wizz Air from Tel Aviv to London Luton. Their online check in wasn’t working so they charged me $25 for airport check in. Avoid. On top of it I nearly missed my flight because there were no Wizz Air staff available to charge me the $25. A total scam and the staff said the website had bugs and this happens the whole time. Also the seats are so uncomfortable they leave you aching all over.

### "cabin crew member was rude"
Outbound flight was 3 hours delayed because of snow. Wizz Air should take responsibility for delays determining missing of connection flight. This was not our case, because we had a 5 hour gap. Inbound flight was on time but one cabin crew member was rude to Hungarian speaking passengers, shouting in English. I suggest sending aircraft from Budapest base on this route, like before. Overall, it was a good value for money return flight.

### "Terrible booking process"
Flew Warsaw to Larnaca with Wizz Air. Terrible booking process, wasted a lot of time trying to make reservation online (muliple glitches causing reservation to be restarted). The page to report issues, doesn't work properly either. Online customer service not very unhelpful.

### "Employees were unsympathetic to customers"
Flew Wizz Air from Eindhoven to Belgrade. Hidden fees, paying for your ticket at the airport. The lowest of the low for budget airlines on the 4 continents I've traveled. Book with someone else or at least add €€ to your ticket price. My baggage fee and ticket printing at the airport cost more than my flight. Expect usual costs of food and drink (Including water) while flying. Not worth it. Employees were unsympathetic to customers without internet access to buy bags and check in online. Charged outrageous fees at the airport.

### "crew are usually friendly"
Varna to Luton. I am a regular flyer with Wizz as I live in Bulgaria and work in the UK. So, generally I think Wizz is good value, on time, clean comfortable cabins (if you have long legs buy your seats in rows 1, 12 or 13. If you join the Discount scheme you get good value for money and the premium package for frequent flyers is well worth it as seat selection etc is free when you pay the annual fee. Priority boarding I have only had one negative experience and this was at Sofia airport on an internal flight, poorly organised but this is not usual for Wizz. The cabin crew are usually friendly although sometimes they are tired on late flights. On board service is good. Announcements from the flight deck are sometimes inaudible or heavily accented and of no use. Negative - Luton in middle of winter, they process you like cattle and leave you (including old people and young children) out in the bitter freezing cold and not for 5 or 10 minutes, can be more than 30 minutes.

### "no information was given"
Flew Wizz Air from Luton to Sibiu. Terrible, miserable, unhelpful staff. Felt like a caged animal, being 6”2 there really wasn’t any room. Very uncomfortable. Long delay leaving Luton which couldn’t be helped as the weather was bad but no information was given. Would not fly again.

### "staff were efficient and professional"
Flew Doncaster to Warsaw Chopin. The Wizz Air staff were efficient and professional. Priority boarding is worth the extra money as it allows you to cut the queue's and also guarantees your on board extra bag. I had an on board meal of baguette and tea which was reasonably priced and very nice. I flew on an Airbus A321 which was only 10 months old so very modern and clean. Highly recommended airline. Travel Tip: Choose rows 1-3 with priority boarding.

### "priority boarding a scam"
Berlin to Budapest. Wiz Air doesn't have a priority queue at the gate, so even if you pay for priority, you won't be the first one to enter the aircraft. Moreover, I was even prevented from taking my hand luggage inside the cabin, so I had to put it in hold. It took 7 weeks for Customer Care to reply on my complaint. They answered that even if there was no priority at the gate, there must have been a bus, and I should have been the first one to enter the bus. There was no bus. Don't pay for priority boarding. It's a scam.

### "Best low-budget Airline"
Flew Wizz Air from Budapest to Larnaca. Best low-budget Airline I have flown! The whole aircraft made a very clean and proper impression. For the first time in my life I did not feel the stressy and hectic way of work here, which is so typical in Western Europe. Staff still smile here from the heart!

### "I highly recommend it!"
I flew with Wizz Air on January 29, from Sofia to Madrid, it was a nice flight, the cabin crew were very nice and attentive. During the three and a half hour journey I felt very comfortable at all times. I also ordered some snacks that were cheap. The seats were comfortable and the legroom was spacious. Very good job Wizz Air, I highly recommend it!

### "Very attractive prices"
Kiev Zhuliany to Cologne. Very attractive prices, even for extra service, and good quality of service. Clean aircraft, efficient boarding  allowed us to depart and arrive on time, clear website and smartphone app, professional crew.

### "seat with your spouse is paid extra"
Barcelona to Riga. Departure was late about 1 hour. Like most low-end companies, they make money on everything so that ticket price seems lower in comparison sites or whatever. Even if you happen to wish to seat next with your spouse it is "paid extra". First priority is given to drinking and eating passengers, especially if they are well known to cabin crew. Since the plane was not full, I asked if it is possible to relocate my seat, because I would like to sit next to my spouse. On boarding I was promised that, but it did not happen - the crew was busy, driving trolleys of drinks, sandwiches, perfume and stuff. Maybe I should have done it myself, even though it is against rules? These are things that airline should not do in this competitive market.

### "Appalling customer service"
Flew Gdansk to Allesund. Appalling customer service. This was the third holiday with Wizz Air. When things go ok, they go ok. There is nothing more to it. When things need attention or handling, the Wizz system shows the worst of an airliner with rules so strict it is impossible to accept its own mistakes. 2 days before return trip we wanted to buy extra luggage. The Wizz webpages malfunctioned on first attempt, failing just before I expected a receipt for the luggage purchase. Ok, I thought, I'll try tomorrow, I'm sure its working again by then. Tried again the next day. Tried from two different computers, and one cell phone. Same malfunction. Thought that now they know about it, and its time to get to the airport. When the error has been there for days, it should be possible to handle it at the airport. Of course not, they dont acknowledge the error or their responsibility for having working webpage functions, when their whole service is surrounded on customers handling ordering etc. Customer service wont pay me back the airport fee of course, and only repeats its my own responsibility. It's simply amazing to treat customers like this. What planet was Wizz founded on? Do they save money on angry customers?

### "aircraft is very cramped"
Vilnius to Rome Fuimicino. Boarding in Vilnius was quite messy, all passengers have been checked at gate and after this they had to wait on stairs for quite a long time, even those who had bought Priority pass - so actually there's no reason to buy it. The plane was located quite far from terminal building but we weren't taken there by bus, we had to go on foot. The aircraft is very cramped, the flight was fully booked and there wasn't enough place for hand luggage onboard so many passengers had to put it under the front seat which is not comfortable at all. However, all aforementioned is quite acceptable for a low-cost carrier. But after take-off it became extremely hot and it was very difficult to breathe, almost all passengers continued coughing during the whole flight - I suppose there were some issues with air conditioning? Nevertheless, the cabin crew was great, takeoff and landing very smooth, and the schedule has been followed to very punctually. But I find the issue with air conditioning absolutely unacceptable.

### "never fly again with Wizz Air"
Zürich to Bucharest. Service Check-in in Bucharest / I was dabbled penalized I checked-in in Switzerland and everything went ok. Afterwards I add a luggage because I wanted to bring some presents to Bucharest. As I did not much to take home to Switzerland, I tried several tomes to check in in Bucharest for the home fly. Unfortunately, I got always an error message, and I could not check-in. At the end, as written in the error message, I decided to check in at the airport. First penalty: The check-in operator explained me that I did not check-in and therefore I must pay the service at the bank desk. The bank charged my credit card 260 RON instead for 167 RON! I think that the retour check in did not function because of the missing luggage. I will never fly again with Wizz Air!

### "will never fly Wizz Air again"
I took a flight from Luton to Bucharest with return and in Bucharest on my way back to London just before to go in the plane they charge me for the small luggage £60 because I had also a hand bag. I will never fly with Wizz Air again.

### "I do recommend the airline"
Wizz Air is the only airline that operates direct flights between Sofia and Geneva. I pre-booked a seat in Row 2. For the first time ever, I saw a Wizz Air priority check in desk, so I skipped the line. I also had priority boarding included in my fare. There is a fast track at Geneva airport which costs 8 CHF per person (around 6.5€), but as there are no long lines at the airport, is not worth it to purchase it. I was one of the first to board the plane. There was no one sitting next to me, so it was like an Intra - European business class seat. We took off on time. I bought some food on board, as there was no food included in the fare. Landed in Sofia on time. The only problem was that Wizz Air lands in the old terminal at Sofia Airport. I do recommend the airline.

### "cannot afford any better option"
Baku to Budapest. I have been flying with a Wizzair for the last 4 years now. I am a student and cannot afford any better option now. Usually there are long lines for check-in in the airport. Very often the boarding was much later that the time that is written on the ticket. So we had to wait 1-2 hours to board to the plane. There is no customer care service! Which is the worst. If you decide to cancel your flight or change your flight - you can forget about your money which you paid for the cancelled ticket. Officially they got some rules written on their website (such as cancellation is free before 14 days of the flight/and there are some charges if you ask to cancel within 14 days). I had to cancel my flights twice. And I asked for cancellation before 14 days. What did I get - I called to the customer care, they misinformed me and told me that I have to write on the website a complaint that I want to cancel my flight - I wrote it and I have been ignored for 10 days - Then I called again to the office, this time the lady says me that the cancellations are made via phone (!) and not their website, which is for special cases (e.g cancellation due to illness), so I will get in any case no refund. I have had two tickets which I wanted to cancel and I got no money/ or no explanation from them at all! Please if you have any options do not pick this airline. All they want is to get more money from you.

### "extra fee system is terrible"
Kaunas to Stavanger. That extra fee system is terrible. If you want extra baggage you need to pay over 50€. You want to select a seat? Pay 6€! If your baggage does not fit in to the cabin, they store it to baggage section. If your flight is 8h late,  you can get 3€ coupon - what I’m supposed to do with 3€ in Norway?

### "nobody gave any information"
I flew Wizz Air from Bucharest to Paris BVA on January 2nd, a particularly busy time as all expats that have been home for Christmas travel back (most people come with checked-in luggage, and the company knows that in advance). There were 5 fully booked Wizz Air flights departing at 6am, and only 6 people at the check in counters to cover everybody. The chaos was total, nobody gave any information, guidance, priorization, there was not even a clear line, as all passengers were queing in the same place. It took 2hrs just to go through baggage drop. Horrible service, never again this company.

### "space between seats terrible"
I flew yesterday Luton to Vilnius and it was very late out of schedule and today I am flying back to Luton from Vilnius - it is late  by an hour at least. It is 100% of late flights in the evening. On top of that space between the seats are terrible, you cant take any comfortable position and bags are not allowed in overhead storage reducing left space further. Staff wonderful, that is only good about Wizz rest is terrible

### "it will end up costing more"
Flew Prague to Naples. Wizz Air may seem cheap but trust me it will end up costing more after the hidden fees add up. Not only were we charged a ridiculous fee of $50 per person for checking in (more than the actual flight) Wizz Air also lost our luggage after guaranteeing it would make the flight. They wouldn't even cover costs for our toiletries. Not to mention they called our hotel promising our luggage would deliver the next day, but after extending our stay to receive our luggage and waiting all day, it didn't arrive. No emails or calls about why it didn't either. We had to travel another 8 days without our luggage.

### "a typical Wizz Air flight"
From Budapest to London Luton, a typical Wizz Air flight as you would expect, it was quite smooth, except that if you pay more for priority, they do not give you the opportunity to get on the plane earlier, you can queue at the plane with the others. Besides that, I chose to pay more because I wanted to bring my backpack to the plane, I had only one luggage (my backpack) and the stewardess gave it back to me to put it under the seat before me. I wanted to travel comfortably, but to get back my luggage for somebody else's (who I presume did not pay extra) - it is not right I think. The staff was quite friendly, courteous, basically I was satisfied with our flight except the above hiccup.

### "the best low-cost company in Europe"
Flew Budapest to London. There are rules at every airline. On the website of the WizzAir everybody can get to know all of the information about baggage, flights, the level of the service and the selection of the drinks and food available on purchase. With this clearly well known knowledge in my opinion WizzAir is the best low-cost company in Europe. For the price of a bus ticket they gave me a lift to London - that is all what I had paid. The cabin is new and clean, the safety is high and the cabin crew is one of the kindests. For 23 Euros it is heaven.

### "customer service is appalling"
Birmingham to Warsaw. Stay away from Wizz Air if you can! The service is terrible, staff are rude and the customer service is appalling! They are very stringent with the rules and do not care about the customers. I have seen them preying on customers to get more money by measuring and weighing customers bags to the gram/mm. If you need to change or cancel your flight they will still charge you to cancel it or change it, they will not even allow you credit to use later. There is no such thing as special circumstances with this company as listed on their website.

### "refrain selecting Wizz Air again"
Milan to Bucharest. Besides the fact that the flight was 70+min delayed, which I can understand in some conditions, this was not the case. Boarding staff were rude, felt like the arrogance was a deminor for their selection. After the delayed boarding they allowed alcohol intoxicated people in the plane and allowed them further alcohol consumption from Duty free. All in all I will refrain selecting Wizz Air to Milan again.

### "Will never fly Wizzair again"
Budapest to Tel Aviv. Terrible company, with even worse customer relations, no clear indication of the rules for check in. for example, after choosing online check in, we weren't able to do so online and ended up paying a ridiculous amount of 40 eur for each passenger at the airport. Will never fly Wizzair again.

### "you can save a lot of money"
Frankfurt to Sofia. Check in counter, security check were no lines. Plane was parked in the south side of the airport (terminal 3 construction area), so it took very long from the terminal building to the machine. We ware in a bus for 30min in total, however flight was on time. Priority passengers and non priority passengers were in a bus mixed in Frankfurt, however, they were divided in Sofia. Priority passengers could get off first in Sofia. As a new rule from winter schedule 2017, without priority, your cabin luggage is hold at the gate without charges. If you have valuable things in a bag, staffs say to you to bring them only into the machine and staffs take your bag. As a priority passenger, I could bring 2 bags into machine. Therefore, overhead bin had enough room and it's possible on time operation. I am a non EU passport holder, and asked VISA check at the check in counter, however in Frankfurt and Sofia both said no necessary to do it. All above matters are mentioned on the web. If you follow rules, you can save a lot of money without any problems with Wizz Air.

### "no one cares about you!"
Budapest to Tirana. Worst experience ever! I had a small bag and they made me pay 45€ fee. The guy told me my bag was 1 cm bigger than it should be, so for 1cm me and my sister need to pay 90€ fee in total. Workers are so rude and no one cares about you!

### "They never said sorry"
Will never fly with Wizz Air again. Flight from Prague to Luton was delayed for 8hrs. They never said sorry. They kept all passengers waiting without any information or explanation. Plane supposed to land at 20.30 in Luton but we were landing at 4 am. Many people gave up and left Prague airport. Other people missed their transports and jobs. No compensation from Wizz Air. Saw many passengers without money or the ability to buy a food so they were starving. Was really unhappy with this airline.

### "They completely ignore clients"
Naples to Warsaw. Booked my ticket in September for March 2018. One month later I notice on my own that the flight was cancelled (no info from the airline side!). After 10 day the free of charge customer service (by email) is is continue to invite me to call the customer service on the payment phone number telling they cant do anything for me (re-assigned flight is opposite to the booked one and i am not in position to eventually re-book it on my own to a different one flight). The free of charge customer service doesn't exist. This is absolutely impossible to speak to anybody. No contact. No solution. They completely ignore clients even if the fault is all theirs.

### "Completely disappointed"
Flew Wizz Air from Bucharest to Cluj Napoca. Completely disappointed! The staff at check-in desk including the supervisor were unprofessional and rude. Arrived at the check-in gate two hours early, the agent told us we had to pay 70 Euros in order to board the plane because we had failed to check-in online. Since we bought the tickets, 30 days earlier, we had tried to check-in online multiple times, at different hours, from different computers but due to Wizz Air’s site problems (in my opinion it was done deliberately) nothing worked. I’ve sent messages to Customer Relations and many other Wizz Air Departments, asking for help but they ignored all communication. I have record of all these messages, all the complaints. Reading online this is a regular occurrence. We were not the only people at check-in desk having similar problems. We paid 70 Euros in order to board the plane. When we got home I contacted Wizz Air Customer Relations. Wizz Air’s Customer Relations Department has responded that they are going to refund only 50% of 70 Euros, meaning 35 Euros. We would never ever again fly with this airline.

### "slapping in excess luggage charges"
Warsaw to Luton. They seem to have staff dedicated to handle slapping in excess luggage charges. The only airline I know of that has small (read wallet sized) cabin luggage and large (read regular) cabin luggage. It’s written in their T&Cs, if you care to waste your lifetime on reading their fine print. But it just shows that they don’t have customer experience in their heart, they lack transparency and are driven by greed. Another example is putting hurdles for those trying to claim aviation tax for unused flights. From a Wizzair club member they successfully converted me into and active campaigner against them. Congratulations.

### "worst experience in Europe"
Budapest to Warsaw. I had my worst experience in Europe. The cabin staff members were so rude. The ground service was so useless. I travel everywhere with my cabin luggage. It was the first time I got charged because it was out of the dimension with the wheels on. The worst airline ever!

### "Worst experience with an airline"
Basel to Bucharest. We had to had to land in Italy, because of an medical emergency. This was ok, but then the crew was to slow to take of again, so that they couldn't fly anymore because of a limit on working hours. They didn´t offer us an alternative, we had to sleep in Italy, but the handling was so slow that it was 2.5 hours. The flight on the next day that was promised at 8 o´clock departed at 10.30 without any comments. So we couldn't sleep and were waiting again at the airport. Worst experience with an airline in my life. Really unprofessional, slow and unfriendly handling. We didn't get any compensation. The airline is not answering to my complaint about the handling.

### "the flight was canceled"
Cologne to Skopje. We went to the airport and we waited for couple hours when someone told us that the flight was canceled after 2 hours before we should be on a plane. No one wants to take responsibility from the company. Every passenger have rights and ours were ignored by the staff of Wizz Air. So we used bus to came back to Skopje at our expense. Our right are that they need to pay us all expenses that we made.They even didnt get the money back from the flight. I am very disappointed from the company and also the staff that no one pick ups the phone or replay our emails.

### "are cheap for a reason"
Luton to Bucharest. I booked a flight using the club membership and when I went to buy the return flight from a different destination the site hadn't updated my membership. I booked it anyway for fear that the prices will go up (which they do on an hourly basis sometimes up at £100 difference). When I informed them about this straight away they claimed that it was my fault for not clicking the discounted price. I told them that it wasn't the first time i'd used the discount and that I'm well aware of the process and they informed me without screen shots they were powerless. I informed them that I didn't want the money back as I go on several breaks a year, money off my next flight (which would be around €20) would be fine. They still didn't budge. Every flight I've had with them there has been problems that they are unwilling to sort out. They are cheap for a reason. Pay a little bit more, it'll be cheaper in the long run. I actually start to miss Ryanair and Easyjet every time I fly with Wizz Air

### "seats are most uncomfortable"
Barcelona to Katowice. As Wizz Air is the low-cost company I'm not expecting a lot. Most of my flight (the short ones under 3 hours) if it's possible are taken by that kind of airline. From all of the ones I know the seats of Wizz Air are the most uncomfortable, non adapted to human body. From 29 October, Wizz Air will change the politic about luggage, so space under the seat in fromt of you won´t be taken by your own luggage. Price of food is not so high, but quality is opposite. Sandwich for 5€ was mostly just bread, and you need to spend more money for a drink to swallow it. If there is any posibility to fly with other airlines just take it.

### "2.5 hours waiting in line"
Burgas to Budapest. I wasted over 5 hours because they failed to provide instructions in a language I could read. After canceling my flight, it's almost impossible to get a response from them in order to obtain the compensation I am entitled to. At the airport, the flight seemed to be delayed somewhat. At 9:45 am I got a message saying the flight had been canceled and I could rebook another one, with no further information. I tried to get information online but the WiFi had crashed under the increasing amount of people in the airport. After waiting in line at the information desk they told me they had no information at the time, but that the airport was closed and it wasn't due to the weather. When asking why the airport was closed, she simply replied: "I can't tell you", hinting that she knew, but I wasn't supposed to. After waiting around around for half an hour or so, they finally announced that we were allowed to leave the airport. I asked what that entailed exactly considering they were saying the flight hadn't been officially canceled, and they said I had to sign in order to receive further information. I asked to read the letter first, but they declined. I signed and received a letter in Hungarian which nobody was able to translate for me. Next they put me on a bus and dropped me off at the departure again. I was told to get in line where I'd paid the exorbitant airport check-in fee of 35 EUR earlier. It was a huge line which was hardly budging. Due to the enormous amount of people, I spent 2.5 hours waiting in line. When I got to the front, the lady told me she had no information. When I asked if there was anyone from Wizz airlines to talk to, she said she didn't know, and I had to queue up at the information desk which had a line of similar length. I expressed my doubts that they would be able to help me there and wanted to record her telling me that I had to go to the information desk so that they wouldn't send me right back. After standing in line for 30 minutes, I was told I had to go back to the place I just came from. The other lady came over and they argued a bit in Bulgarian, without directing attention to me at any time, or explaining anything.

### "we were denied boarding"
Tel Aviv to Bucharest. Not really low cost! Bad service turned it into a very expensive (and frustrating) experience for me and my family! I traveled with my wife and two children to Romania, and we were denied boarding at the gate of the flight back from Bucharest to Israel, because of overbooking. No matter how much we argued and insisted, we were refused. I must emphasized that at any stage there was no call for volunteers to give up boarding, as the EU regulation require in case of overbooked flights, before performing involuntary denial of boarding. The staff member at the gate told us that they are missing one seat, so 3 of us can travel. We explained that we cannot split. Only after we got back to the ticket office at the departure flights counters we were told that we are entitled only for a single denied boarding, as the 3 others had seats and chose not to fly. We had to buy new flight tickets for the next day in a different airline, as Wizz Air had no seats available in the following days. These one way tickets cost us more than the entire round trip with Wizz Air (although it was with another low cost airline). We had to pay for hotel another night, meals, transportation etc. I submitted a complaint and sent copies of all required documents and receipts. It took more than a month for Wizz Air customer service to respond, and their feedback is that they are willing to compensate me for denied boarding of only a single passenger. They provided very limited compensation for the other passengers. The overall compensation Wizz Air agreed for is €984, while my overall expenses caused by this denial of boarding was €2,426. Seriously, Wizz? We know that airlines overbook the flights, but compensate properly your customers when they are harmed by it! At least reimburse the actual extra expenses caused, I am not even talking about compensation for the frustration and trouble. Follow the regulations and ask for volunteers before you perform involuntary denial of boarding! Don’t split up families! If you deny boarding from a member of a family under a single reservation, compensate the entire family! None of us wanted to stay there. The youngest kid was crying, we all wanted to get home already, we had good reason that we explained that prevented us from splitting. Beware of Wizz Air. It may be low cost if you’re lucky, but it can become a very expensive experience if you’re not!

### "definitely use them again"
Luton to Riga. Good flight, on time, friendly and attentive crew and good leg room. The aircraft are reasonably modern and clean. The website is not the most user friendly I've ever used but the airline is good for a LCC. Would definitely use them again.

### "charge passengers with cabin luggage"
Luton to Tel Aviv. Feels like a real fraud. No less. Do not fall for this airline's "low" prices. They charge passengers with cabin luggage that will easily fit into all other low cost airline's allowances. Our same bags have been used without any problem on easyJet, UP, air Berlin, Monarch and others. However this company's staff are queuing all passengers to check bags to minatur cases, so much smaller than any other cheap airline fit cases. They take payments of 40 Pounds per bag so we had to add 80£ to our expensses and they leave you no option not to do so. You feel like they are easily and deliberately taking advantage of your former experience with other airlines and simply change the rulles to grab money from you.

### "These are deceiving practices "
Luton to Budapest. You will end up paying more than with a good airline. They make money by making their luggage different fron any other airline (but look the same), and charging you because the wheels of you bag don't fit their requirements. These are deceiving practices that they should not be allowed to have. Nobody will read this review because people jump on the cheapest ticket prices and 15 people end up having to pay £40 at the plane door for their luggage.

### Wizz Air customer review
Do not fall for this airline's prices. There is a clear money-grabbing scheme to charge passengers with cabin luggage that will easily fit into other airline's allowances - including other cheap carriers. Both our bags have been used without problems on easyJet, Jet2 and British Airways. I know we should have double checked the sizes but having used these bags before, we didn't. The staff go down the line of queuing passengers checking bags to take payments (plane also 1 hour late), which was £40 for each bag on each leg. That added £160 to our city break. We were silly but even so people should be aware.

### "Book with a proper airline"
Luton to Budapest. Extra £40 charge for regular size luggage. Online charge for large luggage £18 Making price of ticket not worth it. Don't fall for it like we did. Book with a proper airline and avoid the hidden costs at the gate.

### "saving money isn't worth it"
Budapest to Luton. When saving money isn't worth it, we all want a bargain but sometimes it's better to shell out a bit more than save money for an awful service. I booked a getaway on Groupon so if anyone reading this is in the same boat then I urge you to reconsider. Flying to Budapest the flight was delayed an hour and change with nothing resembling an explanation given, luckily the flight wasn't full so I could stretch out some but I could tell it would be uncomfortably cramped if anyone was sitting next to me, and I'm only 5'11 so I shudder to think how anyone over 6ft would fare. Then returning we find out much to out chagrin that we had to check in online, bear in mind no-one saw fit to inform us of this, not Groupon, the airline or the company we booked it through. And to make it worse me and my girlfriend were seated at opposite ends of the plane. The ground staff were of no help, not even attempting to help us find a solution let alone sympathise with our problems. So in summary, this airline may be cheap but if you have even a modicome of care for the pleasantness of your journey then I cannot recommend enough paying slightly more and flying with a reputable airline and I'm including easy jet and Ryanair so that should tell you something.

### "crew members were friendly and polite"
Nice journey with Wizz Air from Cluj to Dortmund and return. Both flights had little delays (not more than 15-20 minutes). The captain explained the reasons for delay (on return they hit a bird on landing before our flight and maintenance was necessary). The crew members were friendly and polite. Baggage drop-off, boarding and clearing the airport have been easy and no trouble at all. I liked at return flight the route detailed explanations offered by the captain. I advise XXL seat booking for tall people, since the ordinary seats have little legroom.

### "Please avoid this airline"
Luton to Budapest. One of the worst boarding experiences. It was chaotic because the staff were getting people to measure their hand luggage next to what looked like a micro purse dimension 25cm x 32cm x 42cm which is one of the smallest by the budget airlines. Staff were rude demanding money and threatening to cancel the flight ticket if hand luggage fee was not paid promptly. They were patronising by repeatedly reminding and quoting the allowed baggage dimensions. There was no prompt when checking in either. Cheap airline poor service and unhelpful staff. Please avoid this airline.

### "professional and friendly crew "
My mother, a very nervous flyer had a panic attack on our flight from Sibiu to Nuremberg. We called a flight attendant that stayed the whole flight with my mother, calming her etc. Because of the discomfort caused by the flight, the flight attendant offered us to go into the cockpit at the end of the flight which was very exciting. Overall, a great flight experience with very professional and friendly crew of Wizzair flight W6 3767.

### "flight was pleasant enough"
Tel Aviv to Kaunas. The departure was from the smaller terminal 1 at Ben Gurion airport. Since check in is done well in advance, and since I did not check in any luggage, I could pass the long lines and go directly to security. This was very convenient. If you don't want to pay extra you can only carry a small bag at this airline, but they make that very clear even in their advertisement, so it can hardly be a surprise for anyone. What is more annoying is that you cannot choose seats at check in without having to pay extra. Consequently I was placed in a middle seat, even though the aircraft was only half full. But the person next to me moved away quickly so I could move to the aisle seat. Seat comfort was not too bad, the seatbacks could not be reclined, but being tall I find it more annoying if people in front of me recline their seatbacks without looking back. The catering on board was very uniinteresting, and for someone who does not eat gluten there was hardly anything available. But I had brought my own food, so that was not a problem. All in all the flight was pleasant enough, and even though we were a bit delayed at departure we arrived in time. Since this is a low cost airline my expectations were not very high, but I would not hesitate to fly Wizz Air again, especially since they have lots of interesting destinations that no one else flies to.

### "the food was diabolical"
Split to Luton. We flew to Luton to save money although when looking at the cabin bag sized we realised they would only allow a tiny back pack to fly with, and to fly with a normal cabin size suitcase would cost you £20 there and £20 back! On the flight staff were miserable quite rude and looked as though they didn't want to be there at all. The drinks were reasonably priced but the food was diabolical. You don't expect a lot from plane food but a chicken baguette you can't get wrong - however ours turned up half the ingredients missing and cost us £6. I won't be flying with them again I saved no extra money. I've added 3 photos of what the baguette was described as the picture vs the reality.

### "I now dread my weekly commute"
I fly with Wizz Air every week on the same route from Birmingham to Budapest and have done for over year. Until a few months ago they were generally on time with the occasional delay. I am unsure what has changed but every weekly flight I catch in both directions for the last 2-3 months is late, generally 1 hour late arriving. I used to think Wizz Air was a good airline, good value and reliable but I now dread my weekly commute due to constant lateness. Very disappointing Wizz Air!

### "really minimal seats"
Eindhoven to Budapest. I've flown twice (or 4 if you include return) with Wizz Air. This time was a new plane but really minimal seats. The plane could not land in Budapest because of bad weather, it had plenty of fuel so we waited, but eventually got redirected to another airport, together with another Wizz flight and a Ryanair flight. There we got coupons for a meal, the Ryanair passengers did not receive this. Then there supposed to come buses to bring us to Budapest, 5 hours later there still were no buses, so together with a few other passengers we decided to get a train. Ryanair organized buses to the train station. Overall information on the airport was rather minimal, I don't know if this is accountable to Wizz or to the Airport. Wizz has all the phone numbers and e-mail addresses, so they could have send text or e-mail messages, which enough people could have read. Stewards on this flight were very nice and friendly, on the return flight that went normal they were a bit grumpy, but OK. Their website is very clear and detailed. Food on board was cheaper then in Eindhoven airport, I only had some water but the food looked fine.

### "suggest others steer clear too"
My husband and I traveled to Warsaw recently with our 11 month old on Wizz air. We arrived just over 2 and a half hours before our flight and were told we had to wait until 2 hours before so that we could be checked in. Despite being the very first to check in, we weren't seated together. When we arrived at the gate we were told that our carry on bags that we have been using for years on other budget airlines were too large and we needed to pay £40 per bag to board them. This hadn't been mentioned at check in because obviously that would mean that we could have left one or both in the car rather than paying this extortionate fee. It therefore cost us £160 to transport our 2 cabin sized carry on suitcases to Warsaw and back. We certainly won't be flying Wizz Air again and would suggest others steer clear too.

### "will not fly again"
London Luton to Gdansk with Wizz Air. I was happy with the previous service, unfortunately flying to Gdansk we were one hour delayed. On the way back we discovered smaller than normal luggage allowance which resulted in additional payment of nearly £85! Very unhappy and will not fly again as it's pointless keep buying smaller luggage for the sake of one flight.

### "would avoid taking Wizz Air "
Luton to Sofia. Severely delayed, no communication, no contact person, uncomfortable seating, very poor experience! Plane had a 2 hour 45 min-delay, but provided only a little more than a 1-hour notice. Given how all flights are scheduled and timed, I don't understand how it is possible that Wizz Air didn't know about a 2h45min delay earlier. No one at the airport was there to explain what was happening and why, no drinks, no snacks. Instead of landing at 3am in Sofia, I landed just in time for a short nap before a business meeting. Given the very uncomfortable seating (that's what you pay for), the evening flight became a horrible red eye one! I would avoid taking Wizz Air if landing time or communication are important to you. Or if comfort matters.

### "I got what I expected"
Flew Eindhoven to Budapest. Aircraft flown on both flights were brand new, only 2 months old, however, the seat was not very comfortable: no recline (as you would suspect with a LCC) and an awkwardly placed tray table which was too high to be of any comfortable use. Legroom was decent for me but taller travelers (+180cm) really struggle for knee room. Outbound flight was delayed by 2 hours due to weather conditions and slot restrictions, which was unfortunate but out of control of Wizz Air. The crew were very polite and the pilots kept informing the passengers regularly. Inbound flight departed and arrived on schedule with again very polite cabin crew. First time flying with a LCC, and I got what I expected: nothing more, nothing less then needed.

### "ticket price seem cheap but it is not"
This was my first and last time flying with Wizz Air. The airport staff were strange and not at all friendly. We paid the most expensive check in fee I have ever seen. The ticket price seem cheap but it is not. We stood in the same check in line as people with flights leaving 3 hours later while our flight was leaving in 30min. The screens above the check in counter is often used to inform passengers what line to stand in, but not here. The small and outdated airport in Nyköping Sweden is not a nice place to be. This trip was in the end much more expensive than a regular ticket from an airline with good service. Never again.

### "a total shambles"
Flew from Glasgow to Budapest with Wizz Air. Flight was good, no complaints over cabin crew. Food and drink selection available was also good, if expensive, but that's to be expected. The team on the ground however seemed useless and very unorganised. At the Glasgow end, check in opened late, meaning a massive queue and minimum time to get through security and to the gate. Coming home from the Budapest end the organisation was non-existent. There were about 8 Wizz Air flights all due to leave within a relatively short time. Instead of forming queues for each separate desk, one queue was to be formed for all of them - a total shambles. This led to a bottle neck of people trying to even get into the queue, not a safe situation at all! They were the only company offering a direct flight from Glasgow on the days we needed, and were therefore our choice. For a budget airline the price we paid was way OTT. Between the 2 of us it was almost £600 for our flights and 1 case between us. I'm aware this was due to Sziget festival being on, but very steep. I would fly again, but only if I had to due to bad experiences on the ground.

### "the worst company to fly"
Definitely is the worst company to fly. The cabin luggage is smaller then usual, a surprise you have to pay 40 pounds. Try do do my check in online one day before but they have done already, so I thought was fine and surprise you didn't do your check in online the desk lady told me, I explain that I tried but was done - 32 pounds. Staff desorganized and the flight was more then half hour late. I'll never fly wizzair again

### "staff are very unfriendly and unprofessional"
Flew Wizz Air from Katowice to Malmo. Probably the worst airline in Europe, does not allow printing of the boarding pass at the airport in less than 3hrs before the flight, costing the customer another 35 euro just to print the boarding pass, despite having bought the ticket. The luggage rules are also very customer-unfriendly, there are extra costs for small cabin size approved suitcases (extra cost: 30 euro) and only small handbags/laptop cases are allowed for free (even though some handbags are actually in the size of a cabin suitcase). Wizz Air staff are very unfriendly and unprofessional. Water costs on board of Wizz Air flights. As a frequent flyer I have never had such bad experience with any airline before. Would not recommend it to anyone and will actively discourage people to use it until some basic standards are met (boarding pass should be accessible up to 30 min before the flight, cabin size approved suitcase should be allowed on board without extra costs).

### "staff were friendly, very attentive"
The flight to Baku was on-time and without any major problems. The staff were friendly, very attentive and spoke very good English. It is a bit of a struggle flying a low-cost airline for four hours when you don't have the access to free water and can only get a water bottle for 2€, yet paying 80€ for a return flight to Baku from Budapest is an amazing deal considering the distance. Compared to other airlines, I like that they use the A320, which is much less prone to turbulence.

### "Very unprofessional service"
Budapest to Malta. Worst airline travelled with. Both flights had delays of 1 hour which caused alot of inconvenience to my trip. Had to pay double the price at the airport for the large cabin bag which I hadn't pay for before. Very unprofessional service.

### "good value for money"
Overall we got a really good value for money. This one-way flight from Tel Aviv to Craiova costs approximately 15 USD. The aircraft was new with decent legroom. Seating is not very comfortable, especially when you are tired and the seat does not recline, but it's not too bad on short-haul flights, The cabin crew was nice and friendly even when my companion forgot his boarding pass on the bus leading to the aircraft. The food and beverages are sold at decent prices (sandwich - 4 euros, snacks 0.5-3 euros, water - 2 euros, meal combo which includes a sandwich, a drink, and a snack - 7 euros). The quality of the food is quite good compared to airplane food. I continued with them to Rome Ciampino and returned to Tel Aviv with them via Bucharest. They have been consistent throughout all of these flights. Wizzair does not offer in-flight entertainment, but you can bring your own - no big deal. Wizzair have been fair when they changed our flight time by 30 minutes - we could either accept the change, get a full refund, get a 120% refund to use on wizzair or choose a different flight in comparable routes for free.

### "I'm profoundly disappointed"
Eindhoven to Debrecen. I am flying with WizzAir for almost 6 years. Today is the last day when I will fly with this company. It is not worth the money. The Service is poor, bored people working for a bored company, and incapable of speaking proper English. The quality of the flight for the money paid is below the level. I was required to purchase a luggage package for my laptop bag costing 30€. I have already a large cabin bag included plus the usual facility of having a laptop bag for free which is non-existent. I know Wizz Air is a low cost airline but that doesn't mean they have to charge for a laptop bag. I'm profoundly disappointed.

### "never use this airline again "
Luton to Budapest. I chose this airline because it was slightly cheaper than other cheap airlines but there was a big catch. When I was boarding I was told my carry on luggage is too big and they made me pay £40 to allow it in. That's £80 extra on a flight costing £200 which made the trip even more expensive than luxury airlines but will all the hassles of cheap airlines such as uncomfortable seats no tv system no food or drinks and very tight leg room. Annoyingly when I got onboard I saw that my luggage perefectly fitted under the seat so the whole thing was a sham. I had a feeling about it as I have travelled with this luggage for many years and never had a problem. I took a picture of my bag fit under the seat and I will be sending it to the airline asking for a refund but regardless of the outcome I will never use this airline again for causing me annoyance and ruining my holiday.

### "Staff seemed amateur"
Budapest to Glasgow. Not a good experience! Staff seemed amateur with very poor English and poor manners, certainly not a kind of crew that would make you feel safe or comfortable during your flight. The 2.5 hour delay wasn't pleasant for sure and even though I had a priority boarding pass, it gave me priority only to board a bus where I was standing still in crazy heat for over 25 minutes while we were waiting for all the other passengers to get on the bus. Once arrived near the plane, we stood still for another 10 minutes in the heat, people were getting ill nearby! The mannerisms of crew involved, the control and management seemed very unprofessional and heartless. Will never use this airline again. What a disgrace.

### "recommend for convenient prices"
Cluj to Beauvais (Paris). I had a pleasant flight, the services according to what I paid for. XXL seat is highly advisable to book, since the ordinary seats have little space. Flight on time, attendants were helpful. I recommend this airline for convenient prices.

### "This airline is a disgrace"
My daughter was refused boarding as she was told that her small cabin bag was too large! She has flown many times with Wizz Air with this bag but was refused boarding as they said it was 1cm too tall. This is a small cabin bag that was purchased from JD Sports in the UK. Airport company used was disgusting in handling this situation and should have used common sense. She eneded up having to ditch the bag and use a carrier bag. She had a pair of jeans and 2 t-shirts, so weight was never an issue. This airline is a disgrace. I have contacted them over this but they say they stand by their rules. What rules? Seem to make it up as they go.

### "offloaded from the plane"
Luton to Warsaw. Poorest quality ever. The airline oversold the tickets and I was offloaded from the plane as there was no seat available for me. Not worth even a penny. I wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone who want save a money.

### "I would never recommend this airline"
I chose this flight from London Luton to Budapest because it was really cheap, it was the first time I have flown with Wizz Air and the experience was not so good. First of all there is a trick on the prices as they only include a backpack, instead of the common cabin luggage allowed by all other airlines. In their defence I will say they advise you when you are buying the ticket and days before you arrive to the airport, but it does not avoid people being charged by £60 that are complaining and slows the queue to get into the plane. Once onboard you can easily realise how small the seats are, they are incredibly tiny even in comparison with other low cost like Easyjet or Jet2.com, even Ryanair have bigger seats. The cabin crew are not especially nice either, for some reason it looks like they have no intention on helping you out. Summarising I would never recommend this airline and I would suggest try to get any other flight available.

### "great value for money"
Dortmund to Katowice. This time we flew with a newer A320-200 with Sharklets. So this plane was more modern than the older A320 of the fleet of Wizz Air. The seats were okay not too comfortable. The crew was friendly and helpful. The prices for food and drinks are also ok, a Cola costs around 2 Euros. The plan boarded punctual und also arrived punctual. I cant complain about this flight, great value for money.

### "The most unprofessional airline"
Flew Sofia to Eindhoven. The most unprofessional airline! Always late, always bad service, for a long flight you don't get even a cup of water but you have to pay for everything! The only company with that small size of free hand luggage. Moreover I called twice for a cancelled flight and I was given different information and I was refused to a refund only if I wrote a complaint that takes between 1 and 3 months. I was also taxed enormously for each call that I made even though their webpage says that you are not taxed if your flight is cancelled. Always problems, delays or additional hidden taxes. For me they don't deserve even 1/10 rating.

### "lot of bad attitude"
Timisoara to Luton. It has been a while that I'm flying with WizzAir for the lack of better option and I notice that rather then progressing and improving they are going backwards. All my flights delayed from my own experience and 2 days ago they were only 1 hour and barely apologising for it. In Timisoara airport today very rude staff with a lot of bad attitude making you feel like you are just a stupid client. Is this what I get for my money?

### "no issues or complaints"
Stockholm to Cluj Napoca. Absolutely no issues or complaints about this flight, it went fine and the staff were professional. We were a family of four and got a great price even after paying for seats and large carry on bags. I made sure bags were within limits but they did not check this. I would not hesitate to fly with them again. The plane was boarded and de-boarded from both the front and rear which works great. Boarding pass said, "use the front door!

### "Absolute rip-off"
Terrible airline. Everytime I fly with Wizz Air I swear it will be my last. They charge far too much for luggage. The ticket prices go up and down as they wish. A flight from Vilnius to Doncaster cost over 200 euros - I could have flown to a different continent for that much. Absolute rip-off. Both flights were delayed as well. Complete disrespect for customer and the cabin crew didn't even compensate. Only plus - 32kg luggage. For which you are charged 40 euros.

### "good value for money"
Warsaw to Luton. At the check-in my luggage weighed slightly more than 23 kgs (which I paid for) but no problems occured and I was allowed to check it in without paying extra fee. The boarding procedure was a bit chaotic and there was a long queue to the gate. Cabin safety demonstrations clear and comprehensible. I flew on a new A321 aircraft, which was very clean and the freshness was palpable. The cabin is well designed and even though the seat didn't recline, I felt comfortable  - the legroom was sufficient (I'm 185 cm tall). The food choice in the Wizz Cafe service was in my opinion not large enough, although the products I had ordered were tasty. There was no inflight entertainment, except for the Wizz magazine. The staff was capable, friendly and fulfilled their duties. To sum up, Wizzair is good value for money with only few things to change.

### "problem regards reliability"
Lublin to Luton. Low-cost airlines sometimes are good on deals but you ended paying more on between delays and or issues that you will encounter after. The price that is good, I have also membership so, the price drop even a bit better. The service onboard is just average, quality to price. The seat is ok as standard. The problem regards reliability over time, lately they never on time to the airport. Sometimes they advise beforehand by email, but rarely. My last experience was almost 2 hours delay, that make me arrives very late to work. I have more flights with the same company and I concern about this on my future trips. Also Customer Service rarely reply to any request.

### "it was okay for me"
Bucharest to Barcelona. The price of the ticket and the safety are the most important things for me. The leg space is not very generous, but I am only 1.69 m, so it was okay for me. For me WizzAir and other low cost airlines are very good, because I am only thinking about flying from A to B, no premium service or whatever.

### "aircraft was very uncomfortable"
Warsaw to Aberdeen on an A320. When I arrived at the gate I was told the flight was slightly delayed. Boarding was very chaotic. I had to wait around 15 minutes in the bus before I could go to the aircraft. T cabin was dark and very crowded. We had to wait around 40 minutes next to the runway and were not given any explanation from crew about what was happening. We departed with nearly a 1 hour delay. After departure the crew went round with food and duty free. The 7 year old aircraft was very uncomfortable. The seat was hard and parts of it were torn. There was minimal legroom and the tiny tray table was dirty. However you can't expect anything better considering the price for the ticket which was around £15. The flight was not perfect but you can't expect better from a low cost carrier.

### "price I paid was worth it"
A320 from Aberdeen to Gdansk. The price of the ticket was around £30, £13 for the ticket, £12.50 for large cabin bag and £6 for seat 11F. Security at Aberdeen Airport went very fast. The size of everyone's bagage was checked at the gate and if it did not fit there were fees of over £50 to pay. Some passengers had to pay the fee and the atmosphere at the gate was not nice. I waited in the hallway for around 35 minutes before being allowed to board the aircraft. On board the cabin was dark and gloomy with very dark purple seats. The overhead lockers were full and the flight was 100% full. Seat pitch was terrible and there was hardly no leg room. The seats did not recline, were very uncomfortable and there was gum on the tray table and the armrest. After departure the crew started going round with the buy on board in-flight service and the duty free. The flight lasted less than 2 hours. We landed early at an extremely foggy Gdansk. I passed customs and I had to wait around 8 hours at Gdansk to catch a LOT flight to Krakow the next morning. I would say that the price I paid was worth it, even though the service was not great. One thing I would say is before flying with Wizzair you should always check their cabin bagage policy to avoid paying a £50 or more fee at the gate.

### "Will never fly again"
Flew Wizz Air for the first and last time from Luton to Prague for a one-day business trip. Outward flight delayed by 1.5 hours for which co-pilot and stewardess provided contradictory reasons. One said it was due to bad weather over the Alps enroute for the incoming aircraft while the other said it was due to congestion at Luton airport. The return leg was delayed by over 3 hours but compensation denied because apparently they were asked by Air Traffic Control to not fly due to bad weather. Mind you other airlines were taking off / landing just fine. Poor in all respects. Will never fly again.

### "really helpful and good"
Dubai to Sofia. Had a very nice flight, the cabin crew was really helpful and good. Comfortable flight, on time. Good airport staff in Dubai World Central Airport. Just wrote this review since I had read many negative reviews for Wizz Air before my travel. Good feeling.

### "A joke of an airline"
Bucharest to Glasgow. Friendly cabin crew, the plane was reasonably clean - had the potential to be a positive experience despite the 3 hour delay announced on the last minute. This was said to be due to bad weather on a very rainy day, except from what I noticed most planes were taking off and landing on schedule or with minor delays. I've learnt from recent experiences that such delays are common for Wizz Air. I spent my night in the airport and wasted a train ticket to my final destination due to this long delay as the airline refused to fulfill the legal obligation of providing accommodation (see Citizens Advice website), for which I will be taking my complaint further. They will milk you for every surcharge and attract customers by advertising cheap outbound fares outbalanced by significantly more expensive inbound fares. Doesn't work out as low cost in the end. Would probably be ok for a flexible getaway where you could only pack your toothpaste and a change of clothes, but not reliable otherwise. A joke of an airline whose incompetence will cost the customer.

### "cabin crew was friendly"
We flew from Dortmund to Katowice with Wizz Air and it was not the first time we used the airline. The prices are really good, we paid a round 25 Euros per flight, so you canot expect alot of service. However the flight was punctual and the cabin crew was friendly. Also the airplane was modern. Negative about this flight was the overhead locker which was to small for the amount of luggage on this flight. Also there was not really a lot of space in in general. The experience on board was still good.

### "The prices are good"
Dortmund to Katowice. The prices are good, we paid a round 25 Euros per flight, so you cannot expect a lot of service. The flight was punctual and cabin crew was friendly. Also the airplane was modern. Negative abput this flight was the overhead locker which was too small for the amount of luggage on this flight. Also there was not really a lot of space im the plane in general. The expierince onboard was still good.

### "Good experience overall"
Milan Malpensa to Budapest. Good experience overall, with new plane, kind staff and on time flights. Legroom is not exceptional but standard for low cost airlines. I'd fly Wizz air again, if only they were operating more that 4 destinations from Milan main airport (they serve other destinations from Milan remote Bergamo Airport).

### "18 Euros for return flight"
Cluj to Basel return, flights delayed with 10-20 minutes. Boarding was crowded in Basel but I had priority boarding based on privilege pass and was able to avoid crowd. I had a seat at the emergency exit, for more comfort. Flight attendants were smiling and helpful. Price was 18 Euros for return flight, with cabin bag only.

### "No one here to give us any explanation"
Flew Budapest to London Luton. Terrible experience. 30 minutes delay on outbound flight and a 2 hour delay on my return flight! If you think Ryanair is bad, never fly Wizzair. The sky was clear and the weather was perfect. The only explanation for that delay is their incompetence! There are more than 100 people waiting upset in the boarding room. No one here to give us any explanation whatsoever!

### "going to pay for everything you use"
Flew Tel Aviv to Prague. Wizz Air is a low-cost carrier with maximum restrictions. You are going to pay for everything you use. Bags, personal items, cabin bags, laptop even, a bottle of water, they charge you for everything apart from using the toilet. The A320 is very dirty since it is a low-cost is spend very little time on the ground and it does not actually get cleaned. The tray tables are always dirty, in 90% of the cases. The fleet is very - old 10 years and the aircrafts especially the A320 are in a bad condition. The A320 seats are not suitable for tall people! Your knees will be fixed to the person seated in font of you. The crew are very nice and welcoming though. Delays are very regular for Wizzair. The most important thing is that there is no customer service and the number provided on their website is for sales and purchases of only! If you have a complaint you will have to send an email which will be read very late and will never respond to your emails. Flight experience is horizontal and very poor.

### "last experiences were terrible"
My last experiences with Wizz Air were terrible. From Bucharest to Sweden, when we were delayed by about one hour (without any information about it). The onboard service wasn't as helpful as expected. I was basically denied any meal / drink, as their POS was not working, and they were only taking RON and EUR cash, and I only had SEK with me. I flew many times with Wizz before, but never encountered such a lack of courtesy. For the rest, quality of seats and meals and things are ok, pretty good actually for a low-cost airline. Yet their luggage policies are very different than all the others, in the sense that by default one is only allowed a very small bag, more like a purse - for anything else, there's a price to pay (i.e. the default bags from Ryanair or Norwegian are considered 'large cabin bags' for Wizz).

### "a very pleasant experience"
Cluj - Bratislava and return. A very pleasant experience again with Wizzair. Both flight were on time and flight attendants were smiling and attentive to the passengers and their needs. At BTS airport the ground handling agent told me I had to go to check-in first to tag my large cabin bag, else they must charge extra (this rule is written nowhere on the website), but they tagged it for me at the gate and told me it is OK. Onboard flight attendants were professional and friendly as well. The cost of the return flight was 17 euros (as a Wizz club member), but with the points on my Wizz bankcard it came for free to me. As usual, I booked extralarge legroom seat, for more confort.

### "departed earlier than planned "
Basel to Nis. Delayed flight from Basel departed earlier than planned and left out without 5 checked-in passengers! The flight was delayed for hour and a half and everywhere at the airport EuroAirport Basel info screens was stated that the time of departure was 18:05. When we appeared at the gate at 17:30 the gate was closed and plane ready to take off. The departure was at 17:35, half an hour before scheduled time! The information on info screens was false and we could not get to the plain, 5 of us we were left out even we checked in for a flight! What unwillingness to help and inagility of the Wizz air and EuroAirport Basel, outrageous!

### "queue for several hours"
Basel to Bucharest. We had to queue for several hours in order to get on board. Started from the check-in. We departed with delay and flew longer. No explanation, no excuse. There was such a lack of respect for the customer and his time! After presenting the boarding pass to be left to wait in queue in that "labirinth", around 70-80 passengers "packed" there, after long waits for checking in and boarding. One hour delay for a 2 hours flight it's too much.

### "worst airline I have travelled"
Kiev to Budapest. The worst airline I have travelled with, very strict in carry on's. Smallest seats ever. They seperated me and my family. I will never fly this company again even if they offered me free tickets. I should have read the reviews before booking. Hope no one makes same mistake as i did.

### "Seating highly uncomfortable"
Gdańsk to Eindhoven. Plane arrived late at 9 am, so my flight was late. Staff was very rude and in big rush. It's very visible they are on big pressure. Onboard service started very late and they stop after serving 70% of cabin. Seating is not reclining and it's highly uncomfortable.

### "particularly annoying crew"
I flew with Wizz and I guess I got unlucky with a particularly annoying crew. It was their last flight of the day (they told that to passengers on numerous occasions). At the end of the flight, while we were descending and the seat belt sign was turned on, a cabin staff approached me and requested I put away the bag I had under my seat from food I had earlier, to which I asked her if she could throw it away for me as I don't have any other place to put it (I already had hand luggage there as there's no space in the overhead). The staff got really upset at me and replyied and this is a quote "do I look like I have gloves on? I am not a waitress". Worst airline and most arrogant staff.

### "the most for what you paid for"
Tel Aviv to Budapest. Pretty good airline. They seem to be really efficient in giving you the most for what you paid for. The leg room is a bit of an issue, I'm 1.70 so I didn't have any problem but for tall people I would suggest paying for the extra leg-room sits. They let the passengers board and depart from the back and front so there wasn't much of a delay. No food though, so come prepared.

### "our boarding cards cancelled"
Luton to Budapest return. We had to pay a check in fee of £80 for my wife and I to return from Budapest. We had completed online check in before leaving the UK and had printed boarding cards. The airport staff in Budapest told us our booking had been changed and our boarding cards cancelled. We had not made any changes and when questioned Wizz told me we had changed our titles (Mr /Mrs). Wizz would not accept any responsibility for the charge. The Airport staff at Budapest Airport were most unhelpful and very rude when dealing with us. The flight was fine but the charges were not fair and customer complaints not at all helpful.

### "Absolutely terrible company"
Sofia to Luton. Absolutely terrible company, I am mad after flying with them 2 days ago and I am never, ever flying with them again. You have to pay additional money to buy food or drinks, or buy luggage for check in (big suit cases) or choose a seat etc. Almost every flight I've been on was delayed, once the airplane was broken, so we waited 4 hours in the airport, and when we got on the plane they told us they haven't been able to do repairs, so they are going to fix it when they land on the other airport, and we shouldn't worry, because it isn't something vital for the flight. They charged us (2 people) 80GBP for having our small cabin bags not fitting in the measuring device in height by 1cm - we've traveled before with the same bags more than 10 times and no one said anything before. I complained to the cabin crew, but they were rude.

### "profit with our hand luggage"
My husband and I were travelling from Budapest to Luton with two hand luggage. When we arrived to the gate a member of staff requested us to put our hand luggage in a very small cage, so obviously they didn't fit. The cage had one ridiculous hole in one side for small cabin baggage and in the other side a "normal" hole for a large cabin baggage. The thing was that if you paid 45 euros per bag you were able to take your hand luggage with you on board, otherwise the option was to pay 65 euros per bag and put them on the hold of the aircraft what it is more than understandable as many airlines advise you to do it online when you buy your ticket if you have luggage to check in, but that it wasn't the case. We had a very nice time in Budapest and we enjoyed a lot but we came back with a very bad taste because the airline wanted to make profit with our hand luggage.

### "the treatment is unequal"
Flew Wizz Air from Timișoara to Barcelona. They charged me 30 euros for a small handbag you were theoretically allowed to carry in, additional to the large cabin bag already paid. I was the last one in the row to the boarding gate and all the others passed before me with similar bags or even bigger. It was clear they went for charging taking advantage of the stress created by the situation. The plane was about to fly out. The rules are not at all clear and the treatment is unequal which is really frustrating.

### "they will milk you for every surcharge"
I've flown with all the low cost carriers - but Wizz Air is by far the worst. To start, the price as advertised was impossible. I'm used to surcharges - but they've even invented a difference between small and large cabin luggage, effectively forcing you to buy some additional luggage, even for weekend trips. Added costs not only for checked-in luggage - for for the usual cabin bag. Next, check-in. I arrive at Billund, there are no check-in machines. Arriving at the check-in counter (where the three couples before me in the queue were all shown off for having too large luggage), I am told that if they are to check me in (I did not do it online, I never do, but I am not late or anything), it will be an extra cost. Nothing had been mentioned about this in emails from Wizz Air. At both the check-in counter and the ticket office, where I am sent, they refuse responsibility in the usual weak agency manner, we're not Wizz Air, we're just airport reps. The final cost for checking in two hours before is DKK 270 (incl 30 in airport fee) - around 25% extra on the ticket price. It will be the same again, if I don't check in on the return leg. The feeling that they will milk you for every surcharge they can is pervasive. Inside the flight, the leg space is the narrowest I've experienced, even on low cost airlines, and the airplane is just generally dirty. The staff service was courteous, although of course food and drinks must be paid for. If you're on a short weekend trip around Europe, pay another DKK 500 for another airline (you'll pay it in fees anyway), and don't let an amateur airline ruin your good mood from the outset.

### "you get what you pay for"
We flew Eindhoven to Budapest and return with this airline. You get what you pay for. Flights were on time, cabin quite clean and staff good. Seats are narrow but legroom was sufficient for this flight. Food is for sale just as luggage is and choosing a seat in advance.

### "charged for a cabin luggage"
Luton to Vilnius. Terrible. I've tried Wizz Air once before and it was delayed for 30min. Second time I chose this airline I got charged for a cabin luggage? £40? I wish I would've been the only one. Many of us were. Never Wizz Air.

### "charge you every single way they can"
Flew from Riga to London Luton. Wizz Air have low ticket prices and then try to charge you every single way they can until you get on the plane. The small cabin bag is smaller than a rucksack and the large one isn't even a small one on other airlines. 16€ for a "large cabin bag" (small one for you and I, basically you have no option). If you fail to buy that you get whacked with a 40€ charge at check-in.

### "staff was not extremely over friendly"
I use this route (Eindhoven to Brno) and carrier a lot, and I love it. Both airports are rather small and super convenient. You don't need to be there hours before departure, in Brno 40 minutes is enough, for Eindhoven I suggest 50 minutes when you fly in the morning. Of course, it is a low cost carrier, so there is no inflight entertainment and you have to pay for your drinks. Furthermore, you have to pay for a large hand luggage. But if you are aware of this, it is perfect. I normally take my backpack and its more than enough. When you are expecting to fly more often with Wizz, you can join the Wizz discount club, it will cost you 30 euros a year and it is beneficial when you fly more than twice a year with them. The flight itself was perfect, staff was not extremely over friendly but just friendly. I got empty seats next to me and I was allowed to change to the window seat. Boarding went smooth and fast, and within a couple minutes we were in the air. Please do note that you can't put the backrest backwards, it's only in one position for all flights I was with them.

### "nice, young flight attendants"
A good experience again with Wizz Air, I am a frequent Wizz flyer. Bucharest to Madrid and Madrid to Cluj-Napoca, outward flight was little bit delayed, but arrived on time. Return flight left and arrived 10-15 minutes earlier than scheduled. Ground service at OTP super attentive, the guy at check-in issued us printed boarding passes as we had just smartphone passes, to make things easy. Nice, young flight attendants, with a positive attitude. Board service as usual, paid extra but reasonable prices. Will fly with them again.

### "The value was good"
❎ Unverified |  Budapest to Hahn. Short 1.5 hour fairly empty commuter flight. Had entire exit row to myself, legroom was great seats were the typical slimline type, not very comfortable, but okay for such a short flight. Cabin crew was nice and spoke good English. No wifi or free soft drinks, no entertainment of any kind. The value was good for such a short flight.

### "excellent low cost company"
I just travelled from Bucharest Otopeni to Perugia with Wizz Air. I can't understand honestly why I should avoid this excellent low cost company. Unsatisfied people must understand that the only risk for Wizz Air is to not read the rules on their website. It's not a scam. It's clear and you must read before writing a complaint. They offer a basic service at low value, I bought a place for extended legs and I also own a Wizz Air Frequent Flyer Card. I spent 50€ flying from Romania to Italy. The flight arrived 40 minutes early. The aircraft was new and comfortable. No noise. No offer of scratch cards, no pushy advertising. The FA's were nice and caring.

### "nothing but praise"
Luton to Varna return. I was dreading the flights but I have nothing but praise for Wizz Air having never used them before. I knew what baggage size, allowance was and elected to buy extra 23kg bags plus cabin baggage which at £124 return I thought was good value. Both flights were bang on time with new aircraft and the crews on both journeys were very welcoming and professional! Apart from having to use Luton (which is undergoing renovation at present) they are better than other low cost airlines based in the UK that I have used recently.

### "exploitation of baggage charge"
Luton to Katowice. Horrendous exploitation of baggage charge. Size allowance for cabin bags is smaller than any other, even budget airlines. Cabin crew very rude. I had to to pay £40 because my bag was 2cm to big (weighing 9 kg). I been flying with this bag for last couple of years with another budget airline and never I need to pay stupid amounts of money.

### "cancelled 8 bookings of mine"
Kyev to Bratislava. My complaint is Wizz Air cancelled 8 bookings of mine, concerning 4 people. Although I received credit bills, they did not reimburse me so far (3-4 weeks) I paid for one new booking (in stead of the old booking) I called four times, for hours They asked me four times if I wanted my money back, I said yes but received nothing I want to disrupt my business with Wiizair, three bookings, but they are not reachable by phone. And their app does not work for formal complaints! I want to cancel my next flight from Prg - CIA on 16 march because of their gross incompetence

### "bad customer service"
Flew from Dubai to Bucharest. I had to book with Wizz Air as it was an emergency and we had to book with 2 days prior departure. I fail to understand why would anyone plan ahead and book with this airline on a route that is 5h+. No legroom, no recline, price it's extremly high, bad customer service (for some unknown reason all the flight attendants thought that everyone speaks Romanian, comes from vacation and will pay with EUR or RON, when the foreign currency used in UAE is USD). I had made a purchase of 12EUR and my card was declined for an unknown reason, being of course asked by the crew if I have a Romanian card. The flight takes off in the evening and even though is a night flight the lights were on through out the flight (imagine putting a 2yr old to sleep). It was the first time when I booked a ticket with this airline, maybe it is OK to fly in such conditions on short flights, but for a 5h flight, recommend to avoid it. Better off on this route with FlyDubai (better rates, better service, and closer to the city)

### "had sufficient legroom for this short flight"
A good experience flying with Wizz Air from Timisoara to Luton. I had paid the few pounds extra for priority boarding, as this permitted a larger carry on bag (as I was travelling hand luggage only) and a small carry on bag. The flight departed and arrived on time. As a 6ft3 male, I had sufficient legroom for this short flight. The seat was comfortable enough for the duration of the flight. I did not interact with cabin staff so can't pass comment. Naturally, there was no IFE. This flight was much better than my outbound Luton -> Ohrid. On this flight, I physically could not squeeze into my seat as the legroom was so tight. I moved into an empty exit row seat after take off, but was awoken by cabin crew demanding €20 to sit there. Despite the mixed experiences, I would fly Wizz Air again. It is very much a no frills airline, so set expectations accordingly. However, it offered excellent value as well as safe and timely transportation to my destination. I would recommend the airline for this reason.

### "Wizz Air is the worst"
Groningen to Gdansk. Worst flight ever. Said you could check in online, through the app it said you were checked-in, but when you arrived they now said you were not checked in and had to pay an extra 35 on a flight of 40 euros. Customer service does not respond, will never fly with them again. Oh, and the bag are smaller than with Ryanair so your special on board luggage cases will be useless. Wizz Air is the worst.

### "Will never fly them again"
Brussels Charleroi to Sofia. Same issue as other passengers: Wizz Air  has defined cabin size luggage below other airlines. We had to pay €40 per bag whereas booking them online was €14 p.u. Staff at the desk was extremely rude. Probably because they face this issue with angry customers on each flight. I sent a complain to their website but I expect no answer. Will never fly them again.

### "recommend avoiding this airline"
Luton to Moscow via Vilnius. I would strongly recommend avoiding this airline, I booked a journey with them as I just had a cabin bag and my briefcase and the cheap was the cheapest. In the end because they have an unrealistic perception on a "cabin Bag" un-parallel to any other airline. I ended up paying in total over £60 extra making it the most expensive choice I could have made. Whilst waiting to organise my boarding pass, Wizz air staff were actively searching and dragging people out of the queue to make they could be dealt with separately to stop disruption when they get to the front and get the nasty shock of what they would like to additionally charge. This is an obvious sign that the company operates differently to any other airline and actively know that people have no choice but to pay more or leave their bags. Disgusting. Fortunately the website I went through to book with Wizz Air shared my opinion and were happy to refund the additional money I ha to pay.

### "baggage policy is different"
Bristol to Katowice. The baggage policy is different to EasyJet and other airlines I fly with, however when booking your flight the information is visible and you just have to make sure you have the baggage you need. You can add bags on online after the initial booking too. The free baggage is just a small bag and if you need a normal cabin suitcase / larger bag (think easyjet carry on) it is £9. Annoying, but when the flight is cheap this is hardly a deal breaker. Check in online and boarding etc was normal. No staff were rude to me, I slept during my flight so cannot comment on the food options etc. I organised a bus with Wizzair from Katowice to Krakow that was well organised, cheap and easy to find.

### "made to pay £40 a case"
Luton to Budapest. Absolute joke of an airline. Staff at the boarding gate were rude. When booking our flights online through the website it wasn't clear to me that the free hand luggage was the size of a small handbag (42x32x25cm). You could pay an additional £9 for a large cabin bag. Myself and 14 other passengers were made to pay £40 a case at the gate before boarding. Between myself and my partner this is double the price for our flights both ways. How can they justify this? We were pushed to one side while they tried to take our payments, constantly being told we were in the way (they told us to stand here). Will never fly with them again.

### "Worst customer service"
Budapest to Tel Aviv. Worst customer service, no replies to emails. Waited on the phone forever then got hung up on. Boked the flight with one large cabin bag I then added another and paid with my credit card, when I tried to print a boarding pass the site would not let me claiming I still owed the 6400 HUF - I tried with another card but to no avail. Then I received an email stating that if I didn't pay they could cancel my flight and that I should pay on wizzair.com. So I emailed for help and on the 15th they emailed me an invoice showing that I had paid. I then emailed back that the site would still not print me a boarding pass and I don't want to pay a airport check in fee. I received no reply. When I got to the airport, although I had showed all my correspondence, they charged me for a large cabin bag and for two boarding passes 140$. This is unacceptable.

### "Horrendous exploitation of baggage charge"
Flew Luton to Budapest with Wizz Air. Horrendous exploitation of baggage charge. Size allowance for cabin bags is significantly smaller than any other, even budget airlines. This is mentioned in very small print if you look for it on your boarding information and mentioned in the airport 10 minutes before you are supposed to board. You will be presented with a cage to fit your bag in before boarding and must try to fit it in or you will have to pay £40. It is £12 if you do it online but of course it is too late to do this once you are boarding. If you insist on using this airline be sure to pay online for your cabin bag before, you will have to pay as you can't fit a trips worth of clothes in what is allowed. Personally I will not fly with them again and will advise anyone else not to.

### "the worst low cost in Europe"
Riga to Luton. Due to numerous horrible experiences with Wizz air I believe they are the worst low cost in Europe. Much worse than Ryanair or easyJet. Unfortunately I'm stuck with being their frequent flyer. I got delayed 10 out of 22 of my trips last year, also the delay information is always communicated last minute so it's almost impossible to plan ahead and not get stuck in the cramped airports. They have a record breaking turnaround time of 30 minutes, during which people have to disembark, the aircraft needs to be cleaned and new passengers have to board. Of course the planes are dirty with food leftovers and stains everywhere. Staff look overworked and disconnected. In winter they like to check the boarding pass and let you stand outside in the cold until they finish chucking away the trash (LTN airport). I really dread flying Wizz and I would alway prefer overpaying at the airport for food, water to not give any extra money to this greedy company. If you can, avoid them and fly Ryanair, EasyJet etc for a little bit extra.

### "from A to B for very little"
Budapest to Luton with Wizz Air (W62209). The flight had a 30 minute delay on departure but otherwise great. Also LTN seems to be under repair so it is a mess. Of course with a budget airline there are always charges for everything but as it was a weekend hop it was not necessary to get anything extra. It is not as comfy as other airlines, but it gets you from A to B for very little. I read the other comments saying how much of a rip-off it is but if you read your ticket before departure it has everything on it. Recommended.

### "will be looking to avoid Wizz in the future"
We were extremely disappointed with the service on our way back to Glasgow from Budapest in December 2016 with Wizz Air. We purchased extra services - such as priority boarding, which was not provided - we were all squeezed into a bus. The driver was not present, the engine was off, the heating was off - we were left waiting outside for 20 minutes (I am in my mid 20s, I was fine standing, but what about elderly passengers?) on a freezing cold bus. Let me point out, the flight is at 6.20 in the morning, so the outside temperature is below freezing. There were no staff at the bus who we could have raised our concerns with. While boarding the staff did not care about maintaining lines / queues / checking priority boarding details, we paid extra and had to queue behind a whole bunch of people without PB to eventually be squeezed into a cold bus. This wasn't my first time flying Wizz, my overall opinion is that the Staff at the airports are not motivated at all - I would even say that they could not care less about the passengers. The organisation of the boarding process is awful, we were met with a rude attitude - especially from the ground handling staff. Obviously this is a low-cost airline, so you are prepared to have some inconveniences, such as small leg room, extreme departure times, ridiculous baggage policies etc. I have flown with Wizz 5 times in the past 18 months - as it is the only direct flight between Glasgow and Budapest, however after the horrific experience last time we have decided to fly KLM via Amsterdam. Would like to point out, the cost is the same, or even cheaper, considering the same hand luggage allowance and the lay over is just about 2 hours at Schiphol. Will be looking to avoid Wizz in the future.

### "avoid Wizz Air if possible"
Cluj to Madrid. Avoid Wizz Air if possible, because you will get headaches. Hidden fees everywhere and they don't care. The airport checkin was 50Euro fee for just printing a piece of paper and nobody was in the checkin line to hold the line. Then they hit you with the baggage fee of 60 Euros. I ended up paying almost 200 Euros in checkin and baggage fees for 2 people which is way more than the flight cost. On the plane, the staff is so rude. I asked for a glass of water to take my pill and they told me water costs 2 Euros. The same flight attendant was drinking from a big bottle of water behind the curtain. I will avoid this airline in the future.

### "very disappointing experience"
Just had a very disappointing experience with Wizz Air. Was booked on a Wizz flight from Varna (Bulgaria) to Luton on 29th December. The flight was cancelled. Not the fault of Wizz Air (or so we were told), as it was a weather problem. The problem was that Wizz decided not to tell anyone. We were all booked in and sitting in departures waiting for the flight. The departure board still showed an on time take off. About an hour or so later the departure board suddenly changed to 'Cancelled'. No announcement, no information of any kind and not a single member of Wizz Air staff to be seen. It was just a pathetic shambles and got worse. Now well over a week from the cancelled departure and still waiting for a refund, or at least the common courtesy of a response to my claim. They are keeping my money, paid in good faith for something they did not provide. I tried to contact their so called 'Customer Service' but this was a total waste of time. All I have had from to date is an automated reply confirming that they had received my refund request on 30/12/2916.

### "startled and disappointed"
Eindhoven to Warsaw. From my experience the flights are cheap, rarely delayed, sometimes even shorter than previously estimated. But when it comes to the level of understanding and empathy from the plane crew - last time I got really startled and disappointed. I was a little anxious about flying on my own, I read before the flight on the Internet (and received a confirmation of that on the airport) that situation like that happen and if so, a person in need can count on the support of a stewardess. Well, that was in theory - skipping the fact of difficulties with communicating in English with the stewardess, she informed a "service" like that is not included in the price of cheap flights and if I'm feeling too nervous about the flight, the crew will be forced to make me leave the plane. Definitely not the best way to calm down a passenger, and that kind of attitude was shown right before the Christmas time.

### "Wizz Air are inefficient"
Prague to Luton. Wizz Air are inefficient and the boarding process was like something from waiting for godot. We boarded a bus to wait a further 15 minutes on a bus, to them be brought to the plane to be held on the bus. For 10minutes in a bus that doesn't fit the amount of people inside or for the flight. We then waited for as the doors opened and closed from one end of the bus to another - honestly I would have to be paid and unconscious to get on a flight with this airline again.

### "reliable budget carrier"
Frequent Wizz Air flyer here, Luton-Belgrade return. In all the years I've travelled this route there was 1 (one) serious delay (over one hour), all other departures were roughly on time and arrivals often well ahead of scheduled time. The bottom line with Wizz is a simple one - you should be well prepared for all aspects of your trip and strictly adhere to their luggage/boarding pass rules (which seem to cause the most confusion but are all readily available to consult on their website in many languages) and you'll have absolutely no hassle. Measure your luggage by dimension and weight and, if in doubt, purchase it online, don't leave it for the airport. Always print your own paper boarding pass. Other than that, the seats are non-reclining, pretty hard and tight, the legroom is very restricted unless you purchase it as an extra but the planes are mostly brand new and reasonably clean. The cabin crew is occasionally a little blasé and aloof but far from unpleasant, and most of the time the service is quite satisfactory. Wizz Air may not be to everyone's taste but If you travel frequently and you travel light, it is in my view a reliable budget carrier which has recently built a much better reputation than it is generally known for.

### "will avoid booking again"
Luton to Budapest can't complain, no problems with check in or flight. However returning from Budapest to Luton proved more of a challenge. Paid £19.99 each for Wizz Air transfer from the hotel to the airport. Given a time in which to expect our driver to arrive. For our flight at 18:40 our driver was due to arrive between 16:05-16:35. He did not turn up between these times, I thought perhaps he was picking up other people but when he arrived (10 minutes later) we found we were the first to be collected. At this point we had an hour to get to the airport but had to collect other people on the way, we did not start the journey until 17:20. By the time we got to the airport around 18:00 we had to run to our gate which said it was boarding only to find my luggage bag was considered "large". I had no problem taking this bag on board the first flight but yet had to pay an extra £40 to take it home. Was not impressed by any of this and will avoid booking with this airline again.

### "robbed at every stage"
Luton to Bucharest. Flight itself and service inflight were fine. I'm writing to complain about the ridiculous business model of this airline. Our outbound flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, which shifted our plans around which meant we had to cancel one hotel, book another, and meant we paid for an extra day of our car rental that we didn't need. However this delay did not qualify for any compensation from the airline. On the inbound flight, we tried checking in online on our way to the airport, like many reasonable people do - but found out they have created an arbitrary window that if you check in less than 3 hours before your flight, you have to pay 35 euros per person. So in summary, Wizz Air delaying our flight and making us have to re-arrange hotels and our plans for the first day of our trip means they owe us nothing, but if I try to do something as basic as check in for the flight I already paid for, I have to pay an additional 35 Euro (70 Euro for my girlfriend and I together). On top of that, if you want to call them to complain about it, they charge you 1.3 Euros/minutes. The whole business model is a scam, it just aggravates consumers to be absolutely robbed at every stage of the journey. I'll happily pay the difference on my next trips to fly with any other airline except Wizz Air.

### "flight delayed by 5 hours"
Luton to Burgas return. Flight out went well and could not complain, however the return flight was delayed by 5 hours and none of the Wizz Air staff kept us informed. They did give us a piece of paper about claiming compensation and tried to give us a sandwich instead of a meal ticket. So as soon as I got home I went and filled in the complaint form about the delay and got the standard reply that is has been logged. I know they are meant to reply within 30 days, but I dont think anyone has told them. So I called after 30 days and was told they are very busy and to give them an extra 2 weeks. Still nothing from them so back to the phone I went, i tried to again to get some kind of result but the guy on the phone would not help, no email address, I asked to speak to a manager or supervisor but he just said no. Wizz Air is a joke if you want to complain so I have just raised another complaint complaining about the complaint system. I will update on how and if I get any kind of reply.

### "no human staff to assist"
Flying out of Wizz Air HQ airport you'd expect things to be well set up right? Wrong. This is one step up from a field with a biplane in it. The 'gate' is a tin shed with 3 X different destinations through a turnstile. There are no human staff to assist the the hundreds of passengers who have no way of knowing if the tin shed is gate 2, gate 3, gate 4, or gate 5 or if the queue they are in is going to London, Buchan, established Dublin or Mars. Never again.

### "ripping off on petty extras"
Luton to Kaunas. Never mind that the flights are during ridiculous hours, the flight cost is not so cheap once you take into account all of the additional costs incurred. Online it costs about 15£ to check in larger cabin baggage (keep in mind you can have large or small cabin baggage - unfortunately I missed the small writing), but at the gate they charge a whopping 35£. When I inquired whether it was both ways, I was dismissed rudely. I don't mind paying extra for the tickets, but stop ripping off on petty extras. Unfortunately no decent airlines fly to my default destination.

### "enjoy to be ripped off"
Fly this airline if you enjoy to be ripped off. We flew from Budapest to Tel Aviv on October 16th. I did online checkin prior to arriving at the airport only to have them tell us that they cannot find our boarding passes in their system so they charged us an additional 40 euros each (we were five passengers). I also purchased baggage allowance online with an extra "large cabin bag" for my guitar (which is usually free on most airlines I fly with) - at checkin they claimed my guitar was too long and didn't fit the criteria of a large cabin bag so they charged me for an additional full size luggage 60 euroes with out giving me a refund for the "large cabin bag" I purchased online in advance. Very rude check-in and team manager. Flight itself was fine except for very tight leg space.

### "never fly with them again"
Sofia to Luton. Did not have a boarding card printed out, only the booking. My partner and I were charged Euros 35 each for not providing one. I find this charge unreasonable. I have no comments regarding the seats of the flights - we ordered a coffee etc and opted to pay in sterling. They accepted but declined to accept coins. We therefore offered a £10 note and were given change in sterling coins - how crazy is that. Its a cheap airline - on the make for everything - I will never fly with them again. If you add up the inconvenience of landing at Terminal 1 in Sofia and the hassle of Luton Airport (what a joke that is). British Airways out of Heathrow looks more attractive each time.

### "flights very good value for money"
I was really pleased with the return flight from Luton to Ljubljana. Check-in had no queue probably because they charge for airport check-in. I had to do a visa check which only took a minute. They were quite strict on carry-on bags and I did see someone charged for taking a bigger cabin bag than the free small sized carry-on allowed at the gate. Boarding completed before the ed departure time and we were on the way very soon after that. I was surprised by how punctual it was compared to other short-haul flights I took departing from Luton. The cabin was really new and clean. Seat pitch average,  I liked their tray table, which was a unique design. It was slightly higher than the tray tables on other airlines, so I was able to put my arms on it and took a 40 minutes nap comfortably during the flight. I didn't purchase anything on board, however the price was very competent compared to other budget airlines, especially the price of alcohol. Return flight was slightly delayed due to the late arrival of the aircraft but it was not really bad. All in all, obey the rules and Wizz flights are very good value for money when travelling to central/eastern Europe.

### "cabin crew polite and professional"
My first time with Wizz Air flying from Budapest to Milan–Malpensa and I have no complaints. Flight was punctual, cabin crew polite and professional. Seat was comfortable (paid for extra legroom). Boarding at Budapest was not exactly a pleasant experience, 200m walk from the terminal to an industrial shed for processing then onto the plane. Wizz Air is a budget airline and is strict on baggage rules and printing your own boarding pass etc. But the website is clear on all this and if you play by the rules you should have no problem.

### "very pleased with the cabin service"
Kaunas to Luton with Wizz Air. Very pleased with the flight and cabin crew service. The 3 staff were professional, organised and made me feel very comfortable, especially when I wasn't feeling well. The plane was tidy and also the seats are comfortable. Made my flying experience much better and even though I'm not entirely comfortable with flying, I am looking forward to my next flight with more confidence.

### "never fly this airline again"
Budapest to Alicante. I purchased 3 airfares that included advance seat selection, including the front rows. I had selected row 7 for all 3 of us. However, upon checkin we noticed that 2 of us were bumped to row 23 instead (my toddler and I), leaving my husband in row 7. Because this airline charges fees for everything, I think it's appropriate for me to demand some kind of a refund for the advance seat selection as that service was not provided to us in the end. I've sent several complaints to them the last 2 weeks and they are not wanting to handle this. I will never fly this airline again and I'm considering fighting the charges with the credit card company for services not received.

### "the staff was so rude"
Stockholm to Budapest. Wizz Air is the worst airline I have travelled with. I did not see it mentioned on the ticket that if I do not check in online I will be charged a fee for checking in on the airport. And a fee of >300 SEK at that? Plus the baggage allowance is smaller compared to other airlines. So again we had to pay >300 SEK per bag. All of this cost us more than the actual ticket fare. And the staff was so rude, they simply asked us to either pay up or not board. Please do not call yourself a low cost airline when in fact you only exist to extract money from passengers caught unaware.

### "flight was delayed by for 2.5 hours"
Our flirst flight with Wizz Air was on 24/9/2016, from Valletta to Bucharest in Romania. Flight was delayed by for 2.5 hours, really upset about this long delay. Luckily, there was Wifi at the airport so we could inform our Bucharest driver in advance that we would be late. Will not recommend this airline.

### "fly Wizz Air at your peril"
Luton to Skopje. Swissport handle their flights. Firstly Wizz Air planes, flights, crew etc no issue in fact if it had not been for recent treatment I'd have been happy. I led a group and one of my group was incorrectly denied boarding. Swissport after lots of emails conceded that they had made the error and refereed us to Wizz Air. It's now 2 months after the event nothing has been heard. We've lost £500. You can't ring them as they charge and they don't respond to complaints - they assume you will just give up and go away despite EU law supporting our position. Fly Wizz Air at your peril.

### "exorbitant penalties"
Stavanger to Gdansk. I have flown with Wizz Air twice and both times were a nightmare. Be careful if you book with them - they will try to get money out of you any way they can. The first time was admittedly my own fault for not measuring my cabin baggage - which has to be the size of a small backpack. The fine, however, was equivalent to the ticket price (actually more since I flew with them round trip). The second time was today. I thought I had checked in online because I received a seat assignment, but no. When I got to the airport I was informed that I was in fact not 'fully' checked in because I had not printed out my boarding pass. When I tried to say that I had checked in online and was given a seat, I was informed that this mistake occurred to passengers all the time and that only passengers travelling with Wizz Air frequently, avoided penalties. The fine for not printing out the boarding pass was about 30EUR each. When I asked how someone could support such a scam I was told by the neighboring ticket agent that if I made any more comments I would not be able to board the plane. Finally anyone saying that the seat comfort is ok in their review is lying - at least on the planes between Poland and Norway. They have you crammed in so tightly that even if the seats could recline, there is no room. The whole experience of flying Wizz Air is to receive exorbitant penalties. It is amazing the toilets are still free.

### staff lovely, patient and professional"
I was returning from Skopje to London Luton with Wizz Air. It was an early flight. I was travelling with my friend and her very energetic, enthusiastic toddler. For the first time travelling on Wizz Air, (I have been using them for quite sometime, as they are the only direct air transport company to Macedonia), there were 2 male staff who were astonishingly lovely, patient and professional, not only to us, the adults, but knew how to handle a 2 year old.I

### "a great low cost carrier option"
Keflavik to Budapest with Wizz Air. This is a low cost carrier and this review is based upon the understanding that you know what that means and my ratings would be lower if it was a full service airline. Having said that I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Wizz Air again. Their website makes it clear what you get with a barebones ticket. A seat and small cabin luggage. Want anything beyond that and you have to pay for it. We actually went for added check-in luggage and as this was partially a shopping trip, more allowance on the way back from Budapest. You do need to make sure you understand that 30 days in advance you can check-in for your flight. That's when you should as that will give you the best options when picking your seats. We didn't get this so had to make do with somewhat less than optional seating, but it worked out in our favour actually. So this is a late afternoon flight out of Iceland. Check-in was efficient, but when we entered the terminal many food options had closed. As it turned out when flying to Budapest so had most of the food on the plane. The plane felt new and shiny. Seats OK, you can't lean back at all. This is actually somewhat better as I found it easier to get in and out of the seatrow. Cabin staff were lovely, they look like they enjoy what they are doing and apologized for the lack of food options. But the Hungarian beer and red wine are both to be recommended. Now in Budapest check-in was again efficient and the airport is fantastic. Definitely one of the best in Europe with great variety of shopping/food options. However, the check-in to the aircraft made me feel a bit like cattle being led to the barn. But it worked. Flight back to Iceland was smooth. Crew again looking happy to be at work and at the end of the day I would definitely both fly with and recommend Wizz Air as a great low cost carrier option, if not yet on the Norwegian level.

### "hand luggage dimensions were tiny"
Budapest to Malta with Wizz Air. This airline is a total rip-off. And they didn't even bother to hide or disguise their scam. So you arrive at the airport, check-in and then you go to your gate. The gate for Wizz Air was literally 300m away from the terminal building - you have to walk outside on the airport apron (the tarmac) to get to it. Once there you have to wait until they open the 'gate' - a small hangar. Once opened, the queue was very slow and everyone wondered why. Once our turn came, we realised why. The first thing you see is a counter and a guy checking people's hand luggage dimensions - and the dimensions were tiny. So surprise surprise, many people had to pay 14,000HUF (approx $55) to get their luggage on board. I've been travelling with my small luggage for the past 4 years. I've used countless times on all major airlines, as well as on low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, Easy Jet, Vueling, etc. This was the first time that I had to pay for it! Wizz Air - you can wizz yourself away as you've lost a customer for life.

### "crammed to capacity"
Flight from Budapest to Madrid with Wizz Air. The airport of Budapest seems to be constantly under construction. We were ushered into a hangar where, at the entrance, there was a member of staff checking our tickets. They would look at your suitcase and your boarding pass, and if they didn't like what they saw, they would confiscate your boarding pass and give it to another member of staff. A group of about 5-10 of us were set aside. There, you were asked to measure your bag by putting into the bag size checker. My suitcase would fit perfectly but it was about 5cm too tall. The staff then used a measuring tape (I'm not kidding) to highlight that my bag was 5cm above their 42x32x25cm requirements for a free small cabin bag. I was travelling with my wife. She has a bigger suitcase than me, so I had paid extra for her luggage, but not for mine which is significantly smaller. Despite me telling them repeatedly that I have never paid extra with other low cost airlines such as Ryanair for either my wife's or my suitcase, that this was a daylight robbery, that I had paid for one bag already, that my suitcase did fit into their size checker, that this was very poor customer service on their behalf - they did not budge. I had to pay 45 euros to take my suitcase with me. I was appalled by this. If 5cm is worth more to them than gaining loyal customers I will not choose to fly with them ever again. That aside, I have to say that there was nothing exceptional about the airplane, crammed to capacity, the service or the food/beverages available onboard. Their new A321 planes do not have WiFi.

### "a pleasant, uneventful flight"
I flew Riga to Luton with Wizz Air at 6am. I chose this flight because of the convenient pre 9am arrival time in London, so I was able to start my day in Riga and still make work on time back in London for 9.30am. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of Wizz Air's brand new A320 aircraft and the friendly staff. I traveled to Riga with Ryanair from Stansted, and the difference in Cabin quality, staff friendliness and overall journey experience was huge. I have read some quite bad reviews with Wizz Air, and I am sure when things go wrong they go really wrong - but this was a pleasant, uneventful flight that made it London 20 minutes early. Overall, it was no BA, but miles ahead of Ryanair.

### "staff were polite and smiling"
Luton to Varna. This is the second time flying with Wizz Air. First time was in June to Riga. Having flown to Sofia two years ago then driving to Varna, we decided on flying direct which meant using Luton Airport. We were dubious about using Wizz after reading so many bad comments. However, in our experiences Wizz Air provide a value for money package. There is more legroom than on Easy Jet and Ryanair. The staff at the airport and onboard were polite and smiling. The online booking system is easy to use. So no complaints and we look forward to continue flying with Wizz as and when required

### "crew were very low key"
Flew Tel Aviv - Vilnius and return in early September with Wizz Air. As we boarded in TLV we were shocked to find out that the aircraft had not been cleaned from the previous flight (VNO-TLV), the floor was dirty and so were the bathrooms. Leg room is ok, but seats do not recline so after two hours, it became very uncomfortable. Crew were very low key and did the minimum with not much else. They sell food and duty free. Tried their cheese sandwich which was poor quality. F/A had no clue as to flying time, she said it would be 3h 10 m to VNO, but it was really 3.45. We were happy to get off. Return flight, they boarded us on time, just to find ourselves in a different holding area for another 20 min without seats. Why? Who knows. Why not keep us at the gate seated until AC is ready? Older people, families with children, all cramped together for 20 min in a stairway. I guess not much respect for their guests. Again boarded an Aircraft that was not clean from previous flight. What kind of feeling do Wizz expect you to have boarding a dirty plane? I guess they don't care. You can be low cost and clean btw. Again crew did the minimum, no interaction with passengers, this time no information at all from the pilots, no routing info, flying time etc. This time we stayed away from the food trolley. Tickets were not that cheap either, more than 300 euro RT. All in all Wizz brought us home safe and sound, and that's the main thing. The journey itself and the product were quite poor.

### "never experienced such horrors"
Budapest to Glasgow. We booked in on line and had only one bag to be dropped in. Arriving at the departure department there were no organised lines just a mass of people all trying to get attention. It was a case of pushing through or missing our flight. After this nightmare we eventually reached boarding area but 1.5 hours waiting without any seating was another nightmare. These may be Budapest Airport faults but it ensures we will not willingly visit area again. We are both in our late 80s and have never experienced such horrors at the many airports we have used.

### "poor customer service"
Poor customer service, the flight was nearly two hours late leaving Sofia on 26/08/2016. This was a very late notification of the delay as up until about 1 hour before the departure the flight was shown on time. Minimal leg room with knees pressed against the seat in front, I am 5 foot 7 inches tall. Sofia is not the most comfortable airport to be delayed in with extremely poor tannoy announcements.

### "staff helpful, polite and efficient"
I have travelled 6 times this year to Sofia from Luton with Wizz Air and I am baffled by some of the low scores given by some reviewers. I have travelled extensively across the world on many airlines and have to say Wizz Air are up there with the best. They are not a full price however their staff are always helpful, polite and efficient. The food on offer is as good as can be expected, if you don't like it take your own. I have no hesitation in using Wizz Air, I feel safe, looked after and they don't cost a fortune. What do you expect?

### "delays frequent, everything overpriced"
Bourgas to London Luton with Wizz Air. Awful. My family and I have been flying with Wizz Air for the last 7 or so years to our holiday place in Bulgaria. Unfortunately there are no alternative airlines serving this route. Delays are frequent and everything is overpriced. A couple of years ago our flight was delayed overnight and they still charged us for soft drinks and food on board. I am due to fly with them again soon and I am dreading it. Tonight they sent me an email full of spelling mistakes threatening me that I won't be able to take my hand luggage on board. It is offensive and pathetic.

### "no information about our flight"
Nürnberg to Cluj Napoca with Wizz Air. Maintenance was needed for the aircraft and we waited in the airplane in a hot summer day. After a long time we were sent back to the terminals and offered a 5 EUR voucher. This is nothing to buy refreshment in an airport. Afterwards, no information about our flight. We had to find out from the airport personal that the flight was rescheduled for the next day, morning. This was 5:00 pm and they had no replacement aircraft. This is where full-service airlines are much better. You can count on them more, that they will try to deliver you ASAP to your destination.

### "bad customer service"
Flew from Gdansk to Stockholm with Wizz Air. The allowed size of the cabin bag is less than 50% of the other airlines (including Ryanair), no second bag allowed. Of course no-one has a cabin bag that small, and they force random passangers to measure the bags, and when they dont fit, you will be fined with 45 EUR / $50 USD or leave it at the airport. Bad customer service and delays.

### "service was awful at the airport"
I had a business trip in Palanga, so I took Wizz Air from Luton to Palanga. In Luton, service was a bit friendlier, but the plane was dingy and my tray kept opening up after too much movement from either flight or passenger in front. The flight was delayed 1 hour for some reason. On the way back to Palanga, service was awful at the airport, talk about rude! I had to pay for my carry on bag this way (come on, who makes carry on bags as small as requested!?) and got attitude from the lady at service desk. Wizz Air has great flight times and prices, but Ryanair wins hands down (Ryanair are on time, carry on bag is a decent size, and friendly service).

### "terrible customer care"
Budapest to Luton. Terrible customer care, not even the faintest willingness to resolve problems - even though they have a lot, given the reliability of the online booking system. Customer is important until the point the payment is processed, after that moment they are not taken care of. Best example for this is the customer service: one can either send an email to them - in this case the response time is 30 days, if ever - or call them on a high cost phone number.

### "second flight was better"
London Luton to Warsaw with Wizz Air. This was my second flight with this airline, and it was better. The boarding process was still not good, but the staff in the aircraft was friendlier and patient. I was positively surprised by the Captain's announcements about the EURO 2016, giving an update every 15 minutes.

### "my worst flying experience"
Warsaw to Luton. From the booking process on a horrible experience. You have to make about a hundred clicks and reject all not interesting offers for additional services. When boarding the plane, the staff was unfriendly and did not allow a digital boarding pass, only printed paper. I still do not understand why anyone would do require that. The food is ok, and cheap, drinks are as well. Overall, my worst flying experience so far. Only booked it because you cannot afford other last minute flights to London.

### "never use this airline again"
Budapest to Luton. Without doubt the worst airline I have used. First of all I changed my flights and had to pay £50 - I was frustrated yet accepting by this but it was the customer service (complete lack of) that made the experience so difficult. I then got charged £40 at the airport as my hand luggage was slightly bigger than the allowed sizes, despite taking the same luggage on the outgoing journey with no issue. I was ordered to pay, no compassion or understanding. How can you treat your customers so rudely? They charge fees which have no relation to the cost of the service e.g. Printing flight tickets. I also made a complaint about the service I received and to date I'm still waiting for a response! I will never use this airline again.

### "customer service is the worst"
I booked a Wizz Air flight from Birmingham to Wroclaw. They kept all the passengers waiting till the last minute to proceed to the boarding gate. Once they did, they turned everyone around without giving any information, except for the plane not being ready. They kept everyone waiting for 20 minutes and asked to return whatever they bought at the airport and follow them to a Wizz Air customer desk. This is when we found out that the plane never departed from Wroclaw (it was supposed to fly to Birmingham then back) and the flight is being cancelled. Not from the people that were supposed to help us or give out information. My dad gave them a call in Poland as the flight was long cancelled to find out that the plane has a technical issue. All of the passengers had to go through a single service desk. 200 people. 1 desk! The Wizz Air customer service representative loudly exclaimed that he is not going to deal with anyone and will go home if people do not stop asking questions without waiting in line. It was around midnight already and many people did not not know what was going on, lots of them had no way to get home at this hour. Customer service was horrible, they just gave out "your rights" forms with a grumpy look on their faces without answering questions. We had the right to reschedule a flight to some other airport at the closest possible date. Wizz Air is supposed to provide shelter, food and transport in these cases. Do you think they did any of that? They don't care about their customers. When I asked them about it they told me to file a complain online. If it wasn't for kind people passing on information between each other, lots of them would not know what was going on. Luckily I came to the airport with my car, so I was able to book a flight at Luton next morning. What about all these people that did not have an option like that? When I got into the car I called the customer service quoting my rights and asking for help regarding my car park and dealing with the cancellation. The guy I called had no clue what to do in situations like these, he was no help at all. I hang up in anger as they charge ridiculous amounts for the calls. I left the car park, booked another one at Luton and rushed home because the morning flight was at 9am. Thats when I found out that I had a return flight booked back to Birmingham. I called them to get this flight changed as well and they charged me 30 pounds for changing the booking even though I quoted the whole situation. The flight was supposed to take place 3 weeks ago. I still haven't been contacted by Wizz Air to receive my compensation and refund. I called customer support today and they just kept on asking for reference numbers and had no idea which one was correct. Then he informed me I will be contacted within 30 days but he thinks that there is no need for a refund. I am very disappointed by their service, flight quality, the space between seats is so small. The customer service is the worst I have had.

### "a very pleasant flying experience"
Had a very pleasant flying experience with Wizz Air in both directions. The aircraft was bright and clean and the extra leg room seats were great and available for a reasonable extra charge. Cabin Crew were friendly, polite and professional. Much better than other carriers that I have flown with. Our flights were a little bit late departing but it was no big deal. No problems with baggage, as unlike other passengers who have complained about having to pay extra for their cabin baggage etc, we read the airlines terms and condition relating to baggage. Passengers only have themselves to blame if they turn up at the airport with cabin baggage that is bigger that what Wizz Air allow to be carried for free. You are informed by email before you fly of the allowed baggage dimensions and it is also clearly printed on your Boarding Card. Would definitely fly with this airline again.

### "not be flying Wizz Air again"
Vilnius to Luton. Awful. Flew out a few days ago and the flight was over an hour late. My girlfriend took a different flight on the same day and was also delayed. This airline seems to consistently predict flight times that they are aware they cannot meet. My flight back home today is once more an hour late. Further to that they call boarding before the plane has even touched down so your forced to stand and wait. Trying to be efficient and cut costs has resulted in an appaling customer experience and I suggest that you pay the additional money for any other airline. Will not be flying Wizz Air again.

### "insufficient leg room"
Do not fly Wizzair. Flew from Luton to Prague. The Airbus A320 I have flown in previously but Wizzair's seating configuration made travel massively uncomfortable - seat base size inadequate and insufficient leg room. Planes were late and we were treated like cattle. Bad experience never to be repeated.

### "one of the sneakiest airlines"
Sofia to Brussels with Wizz Air. Without a doubt one of the sneakiest airlines out there. Very unclear baggage allowances and whenever your bag is even a few centimeters too long they immediately smack you with a very high 'fine'. They are either not interested in creating clear guidelines or live off of the fines they hand out every flight. I had to search for half an hour on their website before I found out exactly how to make sure I would not have problems at the boarding, but I saw several passengers being sent back to pay more. Boarding crew was condescending and sneered answers instead of replying normally. Flight crew was lazy and appart from the fake smile at the entrance not friendly either. Definitely never flying with them again, horrible airline.

### "very reasonably priced"
I was very satisfied with my Wizz Air flight. The crew were friendly and looked very professional. No issues whatsoever and the flight from Luton to Gdansk was on time. No issues with my hand baggage. As long as you understand their company policies on baggage fees than you will be fine. Very reasonably priced. Certainly will fly again.

### "Wizz Air redefines the low standards"
Complaining about airlines is almost redundant nowadays. We are all aware of long lines, bad service and endless excuses to make travel unnecessarily complicated. However, Wizz Air redefines the low standards most airlines abide by in today's travel landscape. I decided to travel with Wizz due to their decent hours, considering other flights would take longer to fly from Abu Dhabi to Norway. I had never flown Wizz, and quite frankly never will again. Their information and ticketing says that they allow one small carry-on piece and a personal item. Upon arriving at the airport it becomes a matter of 'or' rather than 'and'. Suddenly, strict rules and regulations apply and a fee of 190 aed ($52) is tagged on. Their definition of "small bag" is the size of a woman's purse according to the person at the counter. Furthermore, trying to argue about the size stated on the ticket and the counter person's definition is pointless as there is no manager available to verify the size. Again, most positions are not manned by people who can make one decision, instead they're only there to follow some ominous rules that I'm willing to bet they don't even know themselves. Airlines like Wizz prey on the blurred lines between miscommunication and misleading so to avoid that, follow their rules as many others have suggested. Better yet, I would suggest not to fly them at all. At face value the ticket price seems great, but quite frankly it's only a small percentage off of the price bigger carriers charge. In addition, Wizz flies out of DWC - an airport between Dubai and Abu Dhabi - for which a cab ride is 200 AED ($54). So, add the base fare, a small hand bag and a cab fare, and Qatar, Etihad and other local international carriers sound like bargain themselves.

### "actual cost was close to BA"
London Luton to Katowice with Wizz Air. Luton Airport bag drop off staff was rude and not organized. It's their daily job and not a difficult one at that, hence I just cant understand why they cant do it properly. Service at the plane wasn't better either, the staff were gossiping a lot about their colleague which was very unprofessional. The actual cost was close to BA as they charge lots for checking bags and paying via credit card. It was my first and last time with Wizz Air, there are plenty of carriers between London and Poland therefore only use them if you have no other choice.

### "just follow the rules"
I frequently fly with Wizzair and always was happy with their service. Good value for money, just follow the rules stated on their website. Flight Târgu Mureș to Luton was on time, services according to travel contract. Contrary to previous menu deficiencies, this time they provided tomato soup on board. It was somehow weird that card payment on Wizzair flight did not work with WizzMastercard (Bancpost), but it did with card issued by another bank.

### "great value for intra-european flights"
Milan Bergamo to Bucharest. Wizz Air is a low-cost airline, which delivers what it promises. When you only pay 9,99 to 19,99 EUR for the ticket, you cannot really ask for more. Read the rules carefully, stick to them and you should not be charged anything abusively. Delays happen and they are generally handled reasonably. Low cost airlines usually do not re-protect you on other carriers so if you fly on less served routes and the flight is cancelled you may have to wait for a couple of days for the next available flight. Overall, great value for intra-european flights.

### "don't provide explanations"
Bucharest to Barcelona. Wizzair has very often delays and don't provide explanations. In Romania they put you to pay the check-in in case you don't make it online. Check-in free service should be available for all kind of flights. The flight attendants during my flight were rude, making jokes and gossiping about one of their colleagues. I will fly with this company only when there's no other alternative. The flights to Barcelona are not so cheap, so it maks no sense choosing them.

### "some sort of delay"
Almost every time I fly with WizzAir there is some sort of delay that the company always seems to have an explanation for, whether it's winter or summer, regardless of the airports. Just yesterday, 20/6/2016, I had a horrible experience when my flight was delayed by 2h from Debrecen to London Luton. In just 5 days, both flights on my return ticket had at least 1h 45min delays. Prior to this, when I flew in January, the flight was cancelled and they never gave us any information, just kept us in the poorly-managed airport in Debrecen. Then we were finally taken out of the waiting area and back to the check in area, and given the option to be taken to Budapest Airport which is a 3-4hr drive.

### "£30 for a large cabin bag"
I bought what I thought was a cabin sized bag, upon arrival at Luton I was greeted by a Wizzair attendant who demanded that I pay £30 for a "large" cabin bag to be placed onboard the flight. As it transpired, there is a small cabin bag and a large cabin bag (who knew) and although my cabin bag squeezed itself into the small cabin bag allocation, the height was 4 inches to tall. Following minutes of discussion and debate with the attendant, when boarding the plane, it happened there was no more cabin space available! All the supposed "small" cabin bags are meant to be stored under seats, leaving the more expensive and paid for larger cabin bags to be stored above, no, the staff initially demanded I pay extra to hold it in the store below. A quick movement of "small" bags from the overhead locker under a seat and hey presto, space! What made this whole process worse is that not all passengers were charged for their large cabin bags upon entry, and only those more honest than deviant! Never again will I fly this airline or from this airport. Train journey from London £27, baggage £65, total £92 on top of the original cost.

### "never fly with Wizz air again"
Luton to Budapest with Wizz Air. Absolute disgrace of an airline. Upon arrivals we were unsure as to whether we needed to check in as we had checked in online, printed our boarding cards and only had cabin luggage. However, as we didn't want to get it wrong we waited in a long queue anyway, only to be told that our bags where to big and had to pay an extra £63 for them (despite them being cabin sized bags). The guy at the counter went on to say that as we had checked in online, we didn't need to queue and if we had gone straight to departures then we also would to have had to pay the £63. He then added that online it would have cost £8. Absolute joke, will never fly with Wizz air again.

### "I am fuming after my trip"
I am fuming after my trip with Wizz Air. Biggest con and scam of an airline. Not only did they make us pay an extra £30 after booking to sit near (not next to) my partner, (which is okay as sometimes expect this with budget airlines) I experienced the worst customer service on the way home and hope this review helps others avoid the same charges I faced for hand luggage allowance. On my flight out to Budapest I took my hand luggage on board with no problems. It was even smaller than my partners shoulder bag in weight and size. On the way back to London, the staff seemed to be stopping every other person to have their bag "checked" for measurements. It was here that the staff member took a tape measure and measured my bag to tell me it was 7cm - yes 7cm over their guidelines in height. Despite it fitting in their bag tester stand that most airlines have. They informed me this very specific measurement was in their booking t&c's and that I had to now pay £35 in fees to cover the extra 7cm. Despite the fact that my bag wasnt full and was half the weight of their 15kg allowance, and I flew out with them and no one said anything. I had to pay, and was very polite about it, and then reluctantly got back in the queue to get on the plane - watching about 50 other passengers also having to pay the £35 fee for the same reason. This seemed like the biggest scam and also completely unreasonable, and did not make sense to me. Whether or not it is in their small print or their individual airline rules is besides the point, I have never experienced anything so ridiculous. Very few hand luggage bags would meet this specification. Warning to all - take the smallest hand luggage possible or just save the hassle and book a normal airline!

### "worst airline I have experienced"
Wizz Air is the worst airline I have experienced, both flights from London to Warsaw including the return were delayed by over 1 hour. They didn't let us know until we were on the plane, and on the way back they only let us know after we had sat in an unventilated bus on the runway for 15 minutes. We were then instructed to leave the bus and head back to our gate. The cleaning standards and baggage allowance is lower than any other budget airline. I would never recommend flying with them.

### "waiting 20 mins in the cold"
We are in the long queue outside gate 3 at Luton Airport right now for our Wizz Air flight from London to Gdansk. Have already been waiting 20 mins in the cold in a queue in front of the aircraft including speedy boarding passengers and families with children. No reason given. Their staff are under the aircraft doing nothing with passengers just having to wait outside.

### "some kind of scamming"
Lisbon to Budapest return. I had no baggage problems since I carefully read all the rules. I bought a 23kg bag and had a smaller bag which was for free. My problem was when I got to the check in point and was told by the rudest passanger service agent that the name I had on my boarding pass was incorrect and I had to go to the office and change it. The problem is that changing your name will apparently cost you 100€. And my name was in fact right because it was my first and last name and never have I ever been bothered with such a thing. But according to the lady I should also have had my middle name. After further research online and on Wizz Air website I have yet to find any warnings that you are obliged to enter your full name. So I can only say that this is some kind of scamming to get people to pay for yet another fee. I did however manage to pass without changing my name which leads me to believe even more so that it is a scmm. Because if they in the end let me go through without any changes or extras paid it must mean that the alteration is not necessary, Even more so since I did the opposite flight (Lisbon to Budapest) and had no problems whatsoever. The aircraft is not too bad and the flight attendants were ok. I just wished I wasn't in such a hurry and had had time to get the names of the two ladies check in points because I've never seen such terrible customer service and lack of care. And the photo shows my bag on the floor because it fell while it was been taken on the cart. Great work Wizz Air and Budapest Airport.

### "no longer a cheap airline"
Stockholm Skavsta to Gdansk with Wizz Air. My general comment is beware. Wizz Air is no longer a "cheap" airline. With all the extras you have to pay the price amounts to what ordinary air ticket with all other established air companies cost. What is irritating are all the extras that are semi hidden. The information is written in small letters and you as customer realise late that what you pay in the end is a regular fare. In future I will try to avoid as much as I can this air company.

### "not getting what you paid for"
Budapest to Warsaw with Wizz Air. This airline is not about getting what you paid for. I thought I had booked in online after receivibg a vague email, only to find out at the airport I had merely confirmed the email. On this email's link it announced that receiving a boarding card at the airport was free - that proved to be false as it costs 40.00 euro for this - I am not sure why, as i could have tried again online at the airport but was told this was not possble. Was not sure why with nearly 3 hrs before boarding, but was told time had elapsed. I cannot be bothered to fly with them again. Enough is enough. They have bent the rules so far it is basically cheating people.

### "invented new baggage standard"
Basel to Warsaw. It is ineresting to realize that Wizz has invented a new cabin baggage standard which they allow for free: "Kleines Handgepäckstück: Falls Ihr Handgepäckstück die Maße 42x32x25 cm nicht überschreitet, darf es kostenlos mit an Bord genommen werden. I had never heard of this definition with any other airline before. What was usually accepted by other airlines as a overhead bin compatible cabine bagage size is not free at Wizz Air. See their original text: "Großes Handgepäckstück: Falls Ihr Handgepäckstück größer als ein kleines Handgepäckstück ist, aber die Maße 56 x 45 x 25 cm nicht überschreitet, können Sie es gegen eine Gebühr mit an Bord nehmen. Es muss in das Gepäckfach passen. So given that the world had been travelling for years with this size of bagage, every passenger that buys a ticket with Wizz and was used to take his cabin carry-on, needs to pay for it.

### "40 euros just for the check in"
Budapest to Luton with Wizz Air. The online check-in system closes 3hours before the flight. The email says: Please don't forget to check-in online or via the mobile application at least 3 hours prior to the scheduled departure time of your flight (at airports where online check-in is not available airport check-in is free of charge). So went to the airport confident, when I got there they said this is not a free check-in airport as it has online check-in (by the way good luck to catch the wifi there). They made me pay 40 euros extra charge just for the check in. People were in queue to pay each 40 EUR. Everybody there was very upset and their customer service personnel smiling at asking to pay the fees. I also saw a lady with a small cabin bag that couldn't fit in their luggage checking cage (with Ryanair that would have passed easy). She had to pay another 50 eur. Pay a little more and have a decent company respecting you and working for your comfort.

### "very friendly and helpful"
Vilnius to Memmingen with Wizz Air. We travelled as a group of four and had problems printing out our boarding passes (not the airlines fault). At check in we explained our problem to the check in agent and he was very kind and checked us in without charging a fee (normaly 35 Euro). The flight itself was nice. Brand new A320, legroom was ok (I am 1.86cm tall) better than Ryanair. Flight departed on time and landed 20 minutes ahead of schedule in Memmingen. Crew members were very friendly and helpful. Like every no frills airline their weak point is, if you have a problem and need assistence. Originally we also booked the outgoing flight with WizzAir but due to a traffic jam we missed the flight. We tried hard to reach the callcenter of WizzAir from Austria and Germany but without success. So bottomline for me WizzAir is a decent airline for fligths within Europe but you have to be aware of the fact that it is a no frills airline and you pay for every extra - on the ground and on board.

### "no legroom and friendly staff"
I was unable to do an online check-in due to a glitch with the Wizz Air website. I phoned their free booking query line and was told, yes, there was a problem and that free airport check in had been applied. We flew from Luton with no problem, the check-in was indeed free. On the return, however, no free airport check in had been applied. As I attempted to explain to both airport staff and the Wizzair folk when I phoned them, I couldn't check in for either flight and explained this when I phoned initially. I assumed, wrongly, that free airport check in had been applied to the return flight too. I was told when I phoned that I needed to go through the online complaints department. Having had to pay approx €70 to check us in at the airport I realise I will not see this back again. This is not sustainable for any airline, the reviews here show I am one of many. They must buck their ideas up. The flight? No legroom and friendly staff (once on board).

### "Wizz the lowest quality one"
Barcelona to Riga. I have flown with numerous airlines and Wizz was the lowest quality one, I ever had. Cabin bag size was strangely small, while booking the ticket and just in case I measured the bag, which was pretty tight between 40-42cm (max, Wizz allows for small bag, is 42cm.) In airport they pulled me over and told to put the luggage in the steel box, they have. So I did and to my great surprise, they insisted, I have to pay, since the wheels are little bit out from the box (not even an inch!) Since I measured the luggage at home with proper measuring line, I insisted they show me the actual length of the box. Of course, now it turns out, this supposedly is not their job, but nonetheless I am forced to pay 40 euros on spot. To make the situation less awkward, they gave me an option, though, which was to leave the bag behind! Lucky for me, I am spot on with the terms and conditions and this was the only thing, I had to pay extra this time, but I saw few people paying ridiculous sums of money just for having online check in and no paper to go with it. Seats on plane couldn't be tilted and the flight attendants go non-stop, selling stuff on isles, so no chance to sleep, unless you are tired to death. No Wifi and media stations, either. If you want to support this type of corporate policy, fly Wizz, if not, there are plenty of options besides then.

### "accept their rules"
Wizz Air is fantastic if you accept their rules. Dubai to Budapest and no problem. You must understand that their free luggage has smaller dimension than other airlines, and can only take 2 carry on bags only if you buy priority boarding. You can generate your proper boarding pass via their mobile app. There are differences from other airlines but the price is cheap.

### "doubled the cost of my flight"
Flew Wizz Air from Skavsta to Budapest. One of the worst airlines I have had the displeasure of dealing with. The tickets may seem cheap at first but they will take more money from you once you get to the airport. No free bag (unless its literally small purse sized) and even paying for a bigger carry on is extremely expensive. They will also tack on fees for not having proper format of boarding pass and when you go to pay for it all they charge you another fee. I just had a regular size (even smaller than average carry on) and a pdf of the boarding pass on my phone (which apparently is not ok) and it doubled the cost of my flight. Will not use them unless there is no other option.

### "an awful airline"
Wizz Air in my opinion is comfortably the worst airline in Europe. Calamity of problems from Luton to Poznan. First of all as part of the booking they charge a reasonable price for the flight but then fleece you on the seat, the baggage, and even the check-in. I was charged 40 euro because I tried to check in 2 hours before flight left - apparently you have to be there 3 hrs. It's just an awful airline. They board you for the flight but leave you on the stairs 3 deep while they wait to open the door. It is one of these airlines that exist because there is no one else flying the route.

### "leg room was tight"
I've given Wizz Air a 5/10 rating purely on price. For a return flight to Kosice, Slovakia it was only £44, that price is incredible. The flight itself wasn't the best. The seats weren't comfortable and leg room was tight, so tight that the back of all the seats were cracked where people put their legs. I quite fancied a beer on the flight as they advertised and offer 2 bees for 6 euro which was actually a decent price. But unfortunately they had run out, I was only on the 10th row, wasn't as if I was at the back of the plane. I am flying with them again in two weeks, so hopefully it will be a lot better next time. Purely for price I would recommend.

### "not flying with Wizz Air again"
Flying from Barcelona to Skopje. Definitely not flying with Wizz Air again. My boyfriend and I were going to Skopje from Barcelona from a 3 day vacation for our 2 year aniversery. When we were at the check in the lady was really rude and gave us a hand written receipt with the cost of 14 euros to pay for one of our luggage cause it didn't feet the Wizz Air standards. We were already late and asked her to help with the procedure cause the gate was about to close. She didn't return an answer and then directed us to some guy to pay for our luggage. When we were paying for our luggage the employee told us that we had to pay 40 euros. Nothing matters at that point so we did pay the amount of money. While we were going back to the check in desk, the lady had left the place with our check in printed letters with her. Looking at the receipt that the employee gave us the price 40 euros was in fact 35 euros that had corrected the first price that was 14 euros. We didn't lose our flight. The luggage was placed at the cabin and it didn't had the control letter you get when you check in. Also other people had larger hand size luggage for free! This was our first time using Wizz Air and it will definitely be our last.

### "unpleasant and unprofessional"
Warsaw to Beauvais. Never again. Returning from a school trip to Poland with 34 young students and having to pay 42 euros each for 10 of these kids, who don't have credit cards and didn't have enough money because their hand luggage didn't meet the ridiculously small Wizz Air standards! The wheels on their cases wouldn't fit into the baskets! Yet a group of Polish people following us were allowed on to the plane with larger sized hand luggage than our pupils and for free! Ground staff were extremely unpleasant and unprofessional. The luggage which my colleague ended up paying for (at a cost of over 300 euros on his own credit card) was then stored in the cabin! This was our first time using Wizz Air and it will definitely be our last. Ryanair is a far better option as is easy et with whom we'll be travelling in the future.

### "never book with Wizz Air again"
I received an email 4 weeks before my travel date to say that my Sofia to Lubeck flight had been cancelled. Initially I was fine with this, but after speaking to their Call Centre I was left very angry and upset with Wizz Air's customer service levels. Firstly, they told me that there were no alternative flights they could offer, which again was not a major problem as I assumed that they would agree to refund my outbound flight from Bristol to Sofia. I was wrong. They refused to offer a refund for the unaffected flight even though I booked both sectors at the same time, and seemed happy for me to fly out to Sofia and leave me stranded there with no way of travelling onwards without paying significantly more money to rebook with a different airline. The call centre agent constantly criticised me for repeating myself which, even if true, is extremely poor service. Ironically, he kept repeating the mantra of 'you will have to complain via the website'. To put this into context, I was refused a refund of just £38 for the unaffected flight which is a very small price to pay to keep a customer happy and to give me the option to rebook alternative flights. As it turned out, the small matter of £38 means that I will never book with Wizz Air again - not because of the flight cancellation (which I can accept) but because of their very poor customer service levels.

### "choose Wizz Air again"
Malta to Gdansk. The cabin crew were very polite and friendly and pilot also very informative. The flight arrived over 30 mins ahead of schedule. The seat was pretty cramped but luckily I had the whole row to myself so could stretch out. The paid food service was efficient and at 6 Euros for a whisky, can of soft drink and chocolate bar was very reasonably priced. Would happily choose Wizz Air again.

### "nice and polite cabin crew"
Flew Wizz Air from Târgu Mureș to Budapest and return. On time flights, fast check-in, nice and polite cabin crew. Good selection of food and beverages on-board (at reasonable prices). Distance between seats too short, advisable to book XXL seats if needed. Airport clearance at destination quite fast. Would fly with them again. Ticket price 20 Euro return excluding baggage.

### "poor command of English"
Luton to Riga return. Plane on time outbound but 2 hours late due to Luton issues for return journey. Plane was clean both ways. The flight took off and arrived both times. Stewards on return journey had a poor command of English and pronunciation was poor. £248 return and no free food. They also ran out of sandwiches on return journey.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Luton to Budapest. I was pleasantly surprised, I made sure my cabin bag was the correct size and I checked in/printed off my boarding pass in plenty of time. Both flights were on time, the leg room was smaller than BA but I have had worse on Thomas Cook, boarding would benefit from boarding in blocks of seat row but otherwise it was fine, the cabin crew were helpful and friendly. I am a regular flyer between London and Budapest and normally fly with BA but at £150 cheaper and flights on time I will use Wizz Air again. I recommend them but you need to read the small print about baggage size and ensure you check in/print boarding passes off in plenty of time.

### "stopped accepting e-format"
After flying multiple times with Wizz Air, I never had to print my boarding pass. Every time, showing the pass on the phone was fine. Last time they refused to scan the code from my phone, arguing that Wizz Air stopped accepting e-format. It was funny because all the other boarding passes could be scanned but not Wizz Air. The airport printing of the pass is 15 euros, money which you pay at one counter then queue for getting the actual print. Not to mention the luggage sizing which has become standard procedure at this company.

### "competitive pricing"
Travelled out on Wizz Air's new A321 and back on an A320. Seats comfortable, good service. Very competitive pricing. Can't comment on the food or drink quality. You are told what their cabin bag size is when you book online, and that you must check in online if you don't want to pay extra. If you read what the site says during booking, the journey could be flawless.

### "staff were extremely nice"
The Wizz Air flight from Barcelona to Sofia was supposed to arrive an hour past midnight and it did. Staff were extremely nice. Nice cognac (at a price) helped me relax. There were no constant announcements and everybody had the chance to rest during most of the flight. Low-cost but quite convenient on this particular route.

### "choose another company"
Awful experience. Worst gates in the airports, both in London and especially in Budapest at return. The first Wizz Air flight was more than 2 hours late, I arrived at 2.30 am in Budapest, no apology, no refund policy, no food, nothing. We brought the usual cabin bag Ryanair-proof and they told us they accepted just the very small cabin bag for free, ours could enter the plane but at the cheap charge of £30! For 2 bags it made £60, more than we paid for the flights. We were left waiting for at least 40 minutes in a iced container far away from any shop in the suburbs of the airport. Trust me, spend a bit more and choose another company if you can.

### "been ripped off"
I have been ripped off in front of hundreds of people. My weekend trip to London ended up with a surprise at the airport. The flight was delayed cause of fog in LTN. Thats fine. During slow and painful boarding I was stopped at the counter to check either my hand luggage fits the metal cage. I was completely shocked, then service agent turned around the normal standard luggage side fitter to tiny hole on the other side. My hand lugage did not fit in matter of milimetres. I had to pay 30 pounds or either 50euros. Shame on Wizz Air. No more flights with you.

### "a painful experience"
What a painful experience Wizz Air was. First, the web price went up 40% in one day, probably due to the use of cookies, since someone else 10 minutes later had my original price displayed, though this is difficult to prove. As, it now seems, many others, I got caught by the "small cabin bag" rule which frankly, is the most stupid thing I heard. Paying more for checked baggage is logical, since there is more handling. But space in the aircraft is debatable: my suitcase is not large, and I have only one, compared with other having a suitcase, a handbag and some shopping to top this up! So on top of the 250 euros price tag (+ CC fees, of course), which is far from "low cost", I paid another 40+40 for my so called big suitcase. The seats are squashed, I was sat at 90 degrees for 2.10 hours (not a short flight! ), but luckily my neighbor did not show up and I could move to an aisle seat. The staff at the gate or in the plane was not particular friendly, but I would not be happy working for that company and I suppose it would be reflected in my attitude. One of the stewardess seemed in a complete rush to close all the compartments, which made me nervous. There is no inflight entertainment and no wi-fi, but that is expected, I suppose. You have to pay for food, but they don`t accept Sterling, but the stewardess took my pound as a euro so I could get some peanuts (and she makes 20% in the process, I suppose). Unfortunately, Wizzair is the online direct flight to Timisoara, so I might have, very reluctantly, to fly with them again.

### "crew smiling and professional"
No complaints here with Wizz Air flight from Luton to Gdansk. Ground staff at check in were very efficient and speedy. Boarding on time and without issue. Seats pretty comfortable and legroom was fine. Didn't bother with any snacks etc as it was a 1 hr 50 mins flight. No on board entertainment. Crew smiling and professional. The instructions for luggage and boarding pass are clearly highlighted on the web booking procedures, so if you can't be bothered to read them then you only have yourself to blame when confronted by a fee at the airport. Overall very satisfied.

### "the worst experience"
Wizz Air from Budapest to London. We recently had the worst experience flying with this airline. Firstly got to the airport and we only had hand luggage but needed to check in. Told that we needed to pay 25£ each just to check in. We then were told that we needed to pay £30 each way for our hand luggage. It's a normal hand luggage size and this is standard on most airlines, but we needed to pay the fee as it was about a cm too large. Madness. We were not told this in advance. I think they are a money grabbing airline that come across as reasonable at first glance but will take your money at any opportunity they can. Terrible. Wouldn't advise.

### "won't use Wizz Air again"
Budapest to Madrid with Wizz Air. It looks like you can´t choose your seats online when you are fliying from Budapest airport, nor do the check-in online. So we went to the desk, and we were asked to pay 35€ to change a seat that we dind´t have the opportunity to choose. After this, we (and 90% of the passengers) had to pay 45€ to be able to take into the cabin the "big" suitcase (the one that is free in all the other airlines). On top of this, there wasn´t space enough in the aircraft for everything, and of course the leg room was tiny. Onboard service was not friendly or helpful, and the flight was a nightmare. I won't use Wizz Air again!

### "they decided to increase my price"
Wizz Air from Cologne to Skopje. After having entered all the personal data, filled in the credit-card payment information and confirmed the charge, they decided to increase my price by first 5% and then the second time around, they did the same again, after the payment was about to go through, they increased the price by 20%. I started booking a 190 Euro flight, and I ended up paying 230Euro for my flight. I would have never gone through with it, but my partner has already booked 1 minute ago, and for him it went through. Never book separately with your partner, as they will lock you in with one person and the other basically has to go up to 30% higher in price, and they only tell you that after the payment information has been input.

### "hadn't expected anything else"
I've traveled with various cheap airlines. So I didn't expect too much from the service. However, it wasn't bad at all. You are not served anything for free, and I didn't ask for any. Generally, the cabin was clean, plane was new, crew members were polite. Actually I hadn't expected anything else when I booked the ticket with a few Euros!

### "have had good flights"
Wizz Air is like all budget airlines, they have rules which you need to follow, and if you do this you will be fine. We fly at least 8 times a year (16 flights) with them and have had good flights. When you are paying the equivalent of a 'bus fare' mile for mile what do you expect. Be careful and read the rules.

### "flight arrived early"
Budapest to Malta return. The flight arrived 10 minutes early. Friendly crew, new plane and good seat on outward flight. Bad things: the food and drink is expensive, and the seat on the return flight was not comfortable.

### "customer service is a joke"
The most shocking thing about Wizz Air is the customer service. It doesn't exist. You write an email, to their customer service, expecting to get a reply and/or explanation from somebody? This is what you get in reply, see below: Dear Customer, Thank you for your letter sent to our Customer Relations Department. Please be informed that no reply will be sent to your enquiry apart from this automatic message. Ok, I'll call the number provided on their website. Call centre is in Hungary, by the way, and calls costs more than £1 per minute. Firstly, too many of them do not speak good enough english, to be able to deal with customers. Secondly, the rudeness is staggering. Absolutely no 'customer service' training whatsoever. After talking to, yet another, extremely rude advisor, she simply hung up the phone, without helping me with my enquiry at all. You ask to speak to supervisor, they refuse. Then they send you back to Customer Relations Department, from whom you get an automated response, stating 'no reply will be sent to your enquiry. It's unbelievable. Their customer service is a joke. And if they were operating from the UK, most of them would not have a job or would have been sacked. I suppose that's why they operate from Hungary.

### "offers on food and drink"
A perfect early morning flight, departed on time and arrived 30 minutes early. Cabin crew friendly and professional, and had the soft sell approach to selling with most people buying something. The airline has some great discount offers on food and drink which can save up to 40%. The A320 was clean tidy and seat were comfortable.

### "that's mean Wizz Air"
Yesterday I was checking flights for this weekend from UK to Lithuania and found that return flight would cost me around £140. This morning (12/11/2015) Wizzair announced 20% discounts on flights. Thought that's very good news, I can get those tickets 20% cheaper. Unfortunately the prices were increased before they announced about discounts and in the end price for return ticket with 20% discount was around £133. That's mean Wizz Air -  just fooling people with 20% discounts. First they increase ticket prices and then Wizz air announces 20% discounts and client end up paying almost the same price.

### "no facility to bag drop"
I have flown with Wizz Air before and found it as expected for a cheap airline. It was a reasonably good experience until leaving Bucharest, where the area for passengers queueing to board was so narrow that priority boarding was a joke - you can't get through the rest of the crowds anyway. Today I am sitting at Luton for a flight at 4.30pm (delayed by one hour and a half) having arrived from Glasgow this morning on easyjet flight. I was prepared for a long day working at the airport but I am absolutely disgusted to find that there is no facility to bag drop with Wizz Air and go through security until 2 hours before the flight.

### "amazing how airline is operating"
What surprises me the most is that this airlines is operating. I had a connecting flight that got delayed and made me arrive 45 minutes before my flight, they did not let me check-in and said that my ticket is gone (wasted 150£). Had to buy a new ticket, checked-in online and when I tried to go they didn't let me in again, asking that I need to print out my boarding pass or pay them 40£ to print me a piece of paper. I said was "this is ridiculous" and the lady said "sir, if you don't like our airline we will be happy to put you in the black-list"! Just amazing how this airline is still operating.

### "definitely fly them again"
Had to make a trip to Poland for business and used Wizz Air on the return. Outward flight was RyanAir (cheap, even with priority boarding and seating) out to Krakow. On the return leg, I took a ticket with options for transfer, large bag and priority boarding and seating on WizzAir flying out of Katowice. Very positive experience, no crowding. I needed a visa check and staff did this for me though it was more than 2 hours before the flight time. Onboard experience was better than Ryanair -  more legroom, cleaner and fresher interiors, good food. Would definitely fly them again for business but the tickets did cost me 3 times as much.

### "rock hard seats"
I travel a lot around Europe and generally find flying reasonable given the constraints of security etc. This airline though is a nightmare. If you want to go on a 3 hour flight on rock hard seats with zero leg room, this is the place for you. Also if you don't want to pay extra, then its the middle seat. Wizz Air reminded me of the bad old days of the cattle trucks of the 1970s. If after reading this you still decide to fly Wizz Air, then you can't say you didn't know what you were letting yourself in for.

### "be aware when you buy membership"
I didn't expect a lot considering Wizz Air prices are usually reasonable. The bit which upset me recently is their disscount club membership fee. I paid for the ticket recently and have been asked if would like to extend my membership for another year. I accepted and paid what I thought was a fee. I buy the membership every year. While I try to book another flight I was told my membership expired, just made a call to their customer service and tried to clarify. Call charge is over £1 per minute and in total it costed me around £14. I have been informed I paid previously extention for a group travel membership instead of whole year single membership. I clearly remember accepting extended annual meembership and didn't think for a second it was any extension. I was booking flight for myself so would not need group membership anyway. So ended up paying fee for some extention didn't ask in the first place, paid for call and still have to pay for annual single membership. Just wanted to make people aware when you buy the membership to make sure. The other thing is customer service team likes to go away from their desk to consult the claim so the clock is ticking and you end up paying for it. Responses made on their website remain unanswered. Very frustrating.

### "worst airline I've encountered"
Wizz Air has to be the worst airline I've ever encountered. Reading other reviews, what happened to us has happened to scores of other travellers. We checked in on-line from our hotel the day before, having paid for cabin and check-in baggage. On arrival at Budapest airport we were told we didn't have a boarding pass and couldn't fly unless we paid an additional $140. I explained that we had already checked in with the boarding pass on our iPhones but they weren't interested. The desk where we had to front to get our boarding passes had 1 staff member and the wait meant that we very nearly missed our flight. The staff were chasing us after security to find the plane hundreds of metres away on the runway. Price gouging at its worst: never again with Wizz!

### "rate Wizz Air in the minus"
Refused to check me in, Wizz Air staff sent me across the airport with the wrong information, then refused to take my bag and to print my boarding card, eventually printing it out when I was at the point of missing the flight. At the gate, they then charged me for the large (2cm above their length measurement) bag they had prevented me from checking in as well as my hand luggage, and also took away my boarding card. At the stairs to the airplane they said my bag had to go in the hold (so much for paying to avoid having to wait for luggage for those so inclined). Boarding, I didn't have a boarding card, but they let me board anyway - I had to ask where I should sit. Shame I can't rate Wizz Air in the minus.

### "not worth the money"
Bought tickets for Wizz Air over 3 months in advance and paid extra for checked luggage. Showed up to airport and was basically blackmailed by the agents on the ground to purchase a printed ticket despite their website not working correctly. Showed pictures to agents, but essentially was refused and had to pay and additional $80 US. Overall, not worth the money and the flight itself was poor. The company nickels and dimes their customers for everything and seats although leather on the flight were thin and poorly cushioned. Not worth the cost even for a short hop around Europe - buyer beware.

### "pay a little more for decent customer service"
I have to say after waiting in a very long queue for ground staff to check every single passengers hand luggage and bags for measurements at the departure gate I was disappointed to learn my bag was a whole 1cm too large to fit into their measurement cage, being hard luggage it had no flexibility like most soft bags tested for size and I was accordingly charged £29.50 for the privilege, I was also refused a receipt as their card machine at the departure desk was not working and they had to call my card details through. The attitude of the crew was nothing short of rude. Would I fly with Wizz Air again, not likely I'd rather pay a little more for decent customer service.

### "miserable flight experience"
I have never had a more miserable flight experience. While the Wizz Air price is initially cheap, add-on prices, including baggage requirements that are unique to Wizz add up quickly. Checking in on their website was nearly impossible, the first day it timing out several times for no reason, and the next day not permitting me to enter passport information correctly - I had to start again several times, and wasted an hour of my day. I was unable to print a boarding pass, and subsequently was charged 30 euros each for this enormous service. And the flight was late, boarding chaotic, and uncomfortable.

### "cabin crew pleasant and helpful"
Great flight with Wizz Air. Plane took off on time and landed early. Cabin crew pleasant and helpful. Drinks and snacks reasonably priced and no hard sell, common with other low cost carriers. Decent leg room and seat comfort. Would not hesitate to use again.

### "would use Wizz Air again"
I flew with Wizz Air from Malaga to Budapest on 4th October returning on the 7th October. My booking was made using their phone app which was easy, and if you take the 'tiny' cabin bag option, the seat they assign you and do online check in its very very cheap. I paid extra for larger cabin bag and an aisle seat. Both flights on time and the cabin crew were friendly. Enough leg room and reasonably new aircraft! Food as per Easyjet/Ryanair isn't cheap however far less choice! I would use Wizz Air again.

### "aircraft was clean"
I paid 19,99 euros for the Wizz Air Charleroi-Bucharest ticket. When you book a Wizz Air flight, you are allocated a seat number, which you can change if you prefer another one. I elected to change to 30A, it cost me 2.50 euros. They charge a fee even for hand luggage, unless it's small enough to be put under the seat in front, as was mine. As Bucharest is off the Schengen area, there was a passport control before going to the gate, No queue and easy. The aircraft was clean and the cabin crew agreeable. The seats are a bit hard; there is a pocket at the back of the seats, with rather an interesting in-flight magazine. The flight was uneventful; it departed a bit late from Charleroi but arrived on time at Bucharest Otopeni airport, docked at an air bridge, with exit through the front door only. If you are in a hurry, you'd better choose a seat at the front of the cabin!

### "disappointed with Wizz Air"
My husband and I were disappointed with our WizzAir flight on 24 August 2015 from Sofia to Dubai. We booked this flight on 11 February 2015 (6 months before), and paid an additional 79 Euro each for the Wizz Plus package that includes all the extras. Shortly after our booking, Wizz Air introduced seat allocation and we used the Wizz Air mobile app to choose our seats (as there was no such option on their website). This was the most tedious process: after each seat allocation the app blocked me from further actions because I had to pay 9 Euro, even though this was free-of-cost for the Wizz Plus package holders. I had to call them onto their international Customer Care number after each seat allocation to clear the bill. After we finally managed to allocate the seats, we received the email confirmation from the Customer Relations Department (Wizz Air Hungary) for our reserved seats together on the 1st row. Firstly, when we arrived to the Sofia airport, we were given two completely different to our booking seats (not even together). After showing the confirmation and the email form The Customer Relations Deptartment, the airport staff issued new boarding passes to us for seats 1F and 1E and we proceeded to the security checks etc. Upon boarding we discovered that our seats 1F and 1E were taken by other passengers with the same boarding passes as ours. Obviously those passengers refused to move and we had to be seated at the end of the plane far away from each other as the crew could not do anything and blamed ground handlers at the Sofia Airport. There were several other passengers on this flight facing the same issue (same seat allocation as other passengers), and it was very unfair and caused a chaos before take off. Passengers were still standing unseated while the plane was already moving. This completely ruined the end of our holiday as we had to travel separately for no fault of ours whatsoever. I send the detailed complaint to Customer Relations Department and also placed an official complaint using their website link. I also requested to cancel our upcoming one-way flight with Wizz Air in January 2016 from Sofia to Dubai. Since then I have sent them numerous reminders to respond, raised numerous requests online to follow up on my complaint, even called their "Customer Care" who could not or did not want to assist whatsoever and said that the Customer Ralations Department must have been very busy and get back to me "shortly". Until today I have not heard from them. This is the worst service I have ever experienced in my life, and from my experience, Wizz Air don't care about the passengers, their concerns or their comfort. I will never, under any circumstances, purchase another ticket for their flights. I would rather fly indirect.

### "caused considerable grief and disappointment"
The flight was OK and the cabin staff were very friendly, it was the getting on the plane that caused considerable grief and disappointment. Firstly, I booked the ticket over a month before I travelled (flight was on 13/9/15). I left Australia for Europe on 1/9/15. The airline sent my ticket the day after I booked, however they didn't send any of the "fine print details" (and these are very, very important) until 11/9/15. I was in Budapest enjoying myself at this time and felt everything had been previously organised. When I arrived at the check-in counter at 4am on the 13/9, I was told I had to pay a 45 euro check-in fee for not previously printing off my boarding pass. When I questioned this, I was rudely told either pay or we will cancel your ticket. As I was on a schedule and basically had no choice, I paid. When I got home and checked the email sent well after I had left, they stated that a fee of 20 euro would be charged for this service. I have since emailed the airline a number of times expressing my concern over the 25euro variation and have (as expected) received no reply. Avoid this airline and their deceptive practices at all cost. Please note I could not give zero scores in my rating and in most areas mentioned, I would have.

### "had seat 1C with extra legroom"
Left Luton at 17:50 a little late but arrived on time. There were 51 empty seats but overhead bins almost full. Some passengers had bags which appeared too big but they seemed to get away with it. It is best to take a flexible bag as this can be squeezed in easier. I had seat 1C with extra legroom, and very nice. Landed at 20:50, passport control empty. Food on board is about average low-cost airline cost. They do not mind if you take own food.

### "Wizz Air with cheap tricks"
We bought tickets through Bravofly to fly with Wizzair and received very little information. When we arrived at the airport, we were asked 120€ just to print our tickets (the online boarding was compulsory but Bravofly did not warn us about it or even remind a day or two before). We then went to the gate when they asked us +300€ for our 3 luggages as Wizzair has a policy of extra small luggages (42cm instead of the standard 55cm). We did not fly and strongly recommend avoiding Bravofly, Europ Assistance (the insurance which never worked) and mainly Wizz Air which is just robbing you with cheap tricks.

### "usually take extra legroom"
Flight on time, short duration (40 min), service at BUD airport was fair this time (previous we had some luggage dimensions issues, but it seems they improved their attitude). Short space between seats (I usually take their extra legroom option). One serious complaint - it is for the fifth time I'm flying with them and they don't have the tomato soup they are advertising for the paid meal service. I wonder why it is the menu if they don't have it at anytime?

### "hope never to fly Wizz Air again"
We arrived at the airport on time, and were informed that our Wizz Air flight was delayed 2 hours. We were given vouchers to spend in the terminal to the tune of £5. At an airport this was sufficient for a sandwich, soft drink, and cake. The flight was further delayed by half an hour, and then we were moved to a large metal room with lots of tightly packed corridors, where we stood for roughly 20-30 minutes before boarding. When we were actually on the flight, it was not too uncomfortable, but I did get charged an extortionate amount for half a cup of coffee (around £2.50 I think). As we pulled into the gate at Luton we were informed that we would have to wait. We waited for about 15 minutes, before we were allowed off the plane. we then proceeded to baggage handling, where we stood for approximately 90-120 minutes, with no indication as to whether our baggage was actually at the airport, before it finally arrived. The person who came to collect me was consequently was charged a large amount of money for their wait (around £8). I hope I never have to fly Wizz Air again, nor fly from or to Budapest, or Luton.

### "flight attendants were cheerful"
Excellent flights and flight attendants were cheerful and hard working. The captain kept us well informed on the way and we arrived back on time. My bag was checked for size in Turku, but in Poland was immediately okayed. People who use low cost airlines are paying very little money and cannot expect drinks etc every time they are inconvenienced. Cabin comfort was better than Finnair and I saw no discernible difference between Wizzar and Air France or KLM European flights.

### "experience of travelling them .. a joke"
Luton to Budapest with Wizz Air, the outbound flight delayed. Stood in a queue by the gate for 30 minutes and the a further 10 minutes outside in the rain. The Wizz Air representative at the gate on the return trip decided that my bag did not fit the criteria of a small bag, even though it was fine on the outbound trip. I was charged a fee before being allowed to board the plane. The name of the airline sounds like a joke and so was my first experience of travelling with them.

### "$200 went into the garbage"
I’ve used Wizz Air previously with no complaints, but my last booking was a disaster! As usual I made the reservation online and didn’t check the emailed confirmation until 4 hours later since I confirmed all the details before pressing send. Turns out the return date was incorrect. From other people’s online posts it seems this ‘resetting’ of data is a common issue. I assumed this can easily be corrected so I called Wizz Air customer service. The call lasted almost 30 minutes. Most of that time I spend being placed on hold. Wizz Air charges per minutes  for these calls. Since I hadn’t caught the error in the first 2 hours after booking I’d have to purchase an additional ticket for the return flight. It didn’t matter that the error was caused by their website and that I was calling within the same business day. There was also no way of escalating this to a supervisor to avoid all the additional charges. I had purchased 2 budged tickets with a great price. Then I needed to add the price of the call to customer service and a new return ticket. In the end it was cheaper to cancel everything and pay a cancellation fee. $200 went into the garbage.

### "inefficient and uncommunicative"
They say the cheapest things end up being the most expensive, except in this case it wasn't that cheap to start with! on our Wizz Air journey to Budapest the board said gate will open in 1 minute, suddenly changed to 30min delay. At the new time it was meant to leave it finally gives you a gate. Walked to the gate. We weren't boarding, we were just being hulled into a tiny room when the plane had not arrived. We were there like cattle, no chairs, everyone really close together for about 40 minutes! We saw the plane land and people disembark. We finally boarded, already running 1.5hrs late. Then we sat on the plan for a further 1 hr 20 minutes- due to "busy air traffic". There was no communication, just insincere apologies and not even a soft drink as compensation. We considered getting the Wizz insurance for the return journey in view of this experience but all you get in return is Wizz Air credit and we had already decided that never again with Wizz Air, and also didn't think it could get worse. We were wrong! Return journey 3 days later. Flight originally on time, gate to open in 1 minute, gate opens B4. 3 0secs later delayed by 1.5hrs. This then increases to 2.5 hrs. Then it changes to please go to voucher desk. No one is at the voucher desk they asked us to go to. All the passengers are now through to an area that only has one shop and an upper crust so there is nothing to do. And no going back to the main area with all the shops and restaurants as we needed to pass a further security check point to get to this unmanned desk. Finally 25 min after they asked us to get to that desk someone arrives with no info, but a £5 voucher for food. He explains there is no Wizz representative in Budapest and he is not sure why there is a delay but thinks it's weather related. Food runs out from the upper crust as that's the only place we can use the voucher. Board changes to boarding so we head to gate. We were lucky to have managed to get some food - however, when the status changed to boarding, people were still queuing up for the voucher in the most inefficient process ever made. Once again, boarding did not mean boarding. It meant being huddled into a cold shed with no chairs, waiting for the flight to arrive and disembark. It ended up taking off over 3hrs after it should have. I was shocked with how inefficient, how uncommunicative, how disorganised Wizz Air was. **NEEDS EDITNG DOWN

### "Wizz Air manages to fail so spectacularly"
Wizz Air website crashed repeatedly when we tried to book, Website design continuously tries to trick you into extras you do not want. Not enough desks at Luton for bag drop such that passengers constantly had to be pushed forward to ensure they did not miss their flights. This was absolute chaos and made the experience extremely stressful, although admittedly the staff were helpful, Departure delay of 75 minutes on outward flight with no apology, neither was this flagged up on the screens, Gate changed at last minute causing more chaos, Flight sat on tarmac with no apology as to why. Seat tray broken on flight in both directions. Chewing gum on the back of seat in front of me - disgusting. Passengers held in what can only be described as a shed on return from Budapest. Flight again delayed for almost an hour - excuse this time that the incoming flight was late - surely this is under the control of Wizz Air also? No milk on flight - powdered cream is not a reasonable substitute. We paid for our in flight drinks in Florints and were given change in Euros as there were no Florints - for a Hungarian company this is ridiculous. I will never fly with Wizz Air again. I am well travelled and appreciate the benefits of a low cost airline. I have flown regularly with the competitors who manage to get these simple things right, so am left wondering how Wizz Air manages to fail so spectacularly.

### "Wizz Air is an awful airline"
Wizz Air is an awful airline, only using it because the company has paid it. Currently sat in Varna waiting for another late flight with them. Seems to be the norm - I would rather go indirect than travel direct with this awful airline. Seats very uncomfortable (I have flown with them before). After 1 hour sat on plane waiting to take off from Luton it was a further 2 hours before any refreshments reached me, that was 3 hours after sitting on the plane. I would rate Ryanair better and that is saying something. This really is a awful budget airline.

### "a good option for those on a budget"
Know what you're in for! I fly Wizz Air several times a year. Usually Dortmund-Gdansk but sometimes other destinations. If you're used to it and you don't expect a typical holiday flight experience, this is a good option for those on a budget. Don't think of it as a flight but more like a long distance bus ride. Here are my tips based on my experience:  Check in online, do it early enough and bring the printed ticket. If you don't they'll charge you a fortune at the airport. Don't take luggage and only one(!) small cabin bag. And make sure that your small cabin bag is soft! Many times I've seen people who had hard shell cases that wouldn't fit the steel frame at the airport by a centimeter or two. They had to pay a lot for that centimeter. Always take a soft backpack that is not stuffed to bursting point. Skip the extras like priority boarding, extra legroom or inflight snacks and drinks. My flight takes between 1.5-2 hours. Bring a book, sit, read and be the last to get in line at the gate. Why sit with crampy legs on a plane for money when it's free and comfortable right in front of the gate? And those crampy legs during the flight? I'm 193 cm tall. If I can suck it up for the duration of the flight so can you. Sitting straight to the back of the seat helps. And the same goes for onboard drinks and snacks. This is the fastest and cheapest way for me to travel this particular route. I don't expect much from it other than that.

### "plane was comfortable, enough legroom"
My first experience with Wizz Air was good. Staff were Lithuanian and were very helpful. Prices of drinks/meals are fair and you are allowed to take 32kg checked in luggage. Plane was comfortable, enough legroom.

### "nice low cost airline"
Cheap, Wizz Air is better than Ryanair and Easyjet. Luton to Budapest, on time flight and helpful crew with good English. New plane with nice interior. The downside is that you have to pay for the hand luggage, which is awkward as everywhere else is free. Nice low cost airline.

### "complete disaster and we will never go near them again"
Our Wizz Air flights were part of a package deal when booking from Last Minute.com and what an error we made. Hoping against hope Wizz Air was not as it had been portrayed in reviews and that the route did not live up to the reputation I found online. Supposedly online booking which refused to function meaning I twice had to call Wizz Air paying £12 per call - lots of hidden charges but still the hope it would be ok -it was not. Our outbound meant to leave at 17.25pm - finally left at after 20.30pm. Plane was new and tidy. As we sat in our seats a highly irate guide was livid as he boarded because Wizz Air had failed to do what he had booked and had scattered 4 young kids, him and another lady across the plane. Staff could barely speak English and interestingly refuse to take their local currency in flight. The return was also delayed and I will never fly with them again. They made Ryanair look like gods - you may be lucky, but read the reviews and look at the trend line - Wizz Air clearly only want your money and treat customers consistently bad. Take a look at their live flight information and weep - delays! A complete disaster and we will never go near them again. If I could score them minus 10 I would. I feel sorry for their staff.

### "will fly with them again"
I read bad reviews of Wizz Air and was pleasantly surprised to most things in my case, were unfounded. I don't doubt that there are hiccups in service, etc. My outgoing flight London Luton to Cluj Napoca provided more leg room than I had experienced on other budget airlines. My return flight however, leg room was back to what I have come to expect from a cheap airline. I accompanied my son and his Romanian girlfriend on the outward bound journey but my return was alone. Being a lone female traveller with little Romanian language knowledge, I found the staff at the airport polite and helpful with a good knowledge of English. The cabin crew were efficient and pleasant. Our plane was delayed by half an hour and passengers were kept informed. I cannot fault this airline and will fly with them again.

### "use another carrier"
Wizz Air is a Hungarian airline, and Hungarian websites have some catching up to do in terms of navigability, functionality, etc. Wizz Air's website has a penchant for resetting certain selections unexpectedly. When my boarding pass emerged with the wrong flight time on it within minutes of booking it, it took an hour on the phone and 40 Euros to fix the problem. There was no opportunity for escalation or to avoid these charges to correct a problem caused by their website. Do yourself a favor and use another carrier.

### "exorbitant extras I paid"
If you are flying with Wizz Air, do not ever fail to complete your online check-in and print the online check-in confirmation at least 3 hours before the flight. Online check-in closes 3 hours before the flight. And at the airport, they charge the exorbitant €45 per person check-in cost, which is also charged for children from 2-12. And do not ever bring extra luggage, not a small bag or a musical instrument, which may cause an extra €60 for you. During my flight from Istanbul to Budapest, I tried to online checkin but the website mentioned that online checkin was not available for that route. So, nothing wrong happened when I boarded in Istanbul. Due to that, I thought online checkin would not be allowed for the return flight either, and the company did not send me a notification mail to complete my online checkin, although most other airlines do that. So, I failed to do online check-in, and I was not allowed to do it although I was at the airport 2 hours and 50 minutes before the flight. And here's what happened to me. Furthermore, the ticketing personnel forced me to put my musical instrument (accordion) in the luggage although it was smaller than the size of a large cabin bag, and I had to fight for 1 hour to convince her. Considering the exorbitant extras I paid at the airport (totaling €285 for 5 people and one luggage) and the tension I faced, I could actually fly by Turkish Airlines at a lower cost, which offers wider space, luggage allowance and food, and which does not charge any extra fees for airport check-in.

### "don't expect great friendliness"
Price was fantastic and our Wizz Air flight was on time. However, I have never ever experienced such rude and impolite staff like it before. I did not expect luxury or exceptional service, but I did expect politeness and a friendly smile. We returned with SAS on a similar budget and were amazed at the difference! Wizz Air are great for price, but don't expect great friendliness on board!

### "late arrival of incoming plane"
There was a huge delay for our Wizz Air flight. Having arrived at the Departures lounge we waited for our gate number. Every time (twice) it got below 60 mins to Departure, the time went back. It actually moved in our favour once but that was just their joke. The 16.40 flight actually left at 20.10. Nobody texted, emailed or announced the delay or reasons for it. No effort was made to make our wait more comfortable. When we got to the gate we heard an Easyjet announcement (another flight) speaking clearly and explaining their process. Then a Wizzair bark about our flight and the excuse for famous "late arrival of incoming plane". The plane was comfortable and crew delivered service with a smile.

### "no information given"
3.5 hours delay with no information given or ground staff available to answer questions.

### "very quick and efficient"
Was worried about flying with this company after reading reviews but got to say shouldn't have worried. Basically you pay for what you want and make sure you have done everything that has been requested by them such as entering passport information online and printing off boarding passes on A4 paper in advance. This was the easiest check in ever, very quick and efficient, booked 2 suitcases on with the weight we wanted and paid a little extra for seats together and priority boarding as we had small children with us. Price still came in well under what you would pay with Thomas Cook / Thomson or equivalent. Would recommend flying with Wizz Air.

### Wizz Air customer review
I was taking a trip on Wizz Air from Warsaw to Budapest with my wife. Firstly, the flight was delayed about 20 minutes. In the plane we want to sit together, so we had to pay extra money, because we haven't queued in front of the gate 40 minutes earlier. Aircraft interior was very dirty and there was rubbish on the floor. My seatback tray was broken, but it doesn't matter because onboard you won't even get a bottle of water for free! Return flight was delayed nearly 3 hours and it just disappeared from the board. There was no customer service, because passengers was backed into an outdoor terminal.

### Wizz Air customer review
After being relentlessly milked for €150 at the airport for the privilege of surly staff to print our boarding passes (in between making personal calls and delaying the process), a fairly mediocre flight was followed by a 20 minute delay in a boiling hot plane, waiting for the staff to get the plane doors open. You would have thought this would have given them time to get the baggage from the plane and onto the carousel in the airport. You would be wrong. At the time of writing, the baggage had taken more than 30 minutes to find itself from the plane to the carousel, mere metres away. This entire review, in fact, was written during a mere fraction of my waiting time at the carousel. Would not fly with Wizz Air again.

### Wizz Air customer review
I am traveling about 6 times a year with Wizz. Im my last flight I have to pay 40€ for the cabin baggage that I use for 2 years now because the boarding crew considered that the 2cm of difference are unacceptable, even though their colleagues from 5 different airports never said a word about it. Not talking about the cabin crew who started to yell to a woman with a child in her arms because by mistake she chose another seat than her own. As a low cost company they will serve you food or drinks if you buy it, but very often their offers are not available.

### Wizz Air customer review
Yes it's possible to be worse than Ryanair for extracting extra money from customers. We all know that some economy airlines charge for every extra they can. But the Wizz Air website takes it to a new level and is clearly designed to 'rack up' the cost of the flight. If you have the time to tread carefully then you can book a reasonably cheap flight but there are certainly other airlines that are cheaper as they dont 'rack up' the costs as you proceed. The Wizz air we site is far from 'user friendly', is often slow and crashes son be prepared to be patient. Be prepared to be continually asked to pay for things you have already paid for. Don't be surprised if you pay a lot more than the advertised rates. If there is an alternative airline I would recommend using it.

### Wizz Air customer review
Decent low-cost airline. Online check-in available days before the flight. I didn't pay extra, so there was no reserved seat number, just going in and looking for one. No meals. Stuff are nice and they were not too strict about baggage dimensions. Seats themselves and the cabin were fine.

### Wizz Air customer review
Not a good experience. Cramped seating, no airline staff around at either airport. A very confusing website and check in process (any airline that resorts to using "fine print" to absolve themselves should be ashamed). The clincher for me is the premium rate number for customer services. They clearly don't want to speak to their customers.

### Wizz Air customer review
A lot of people here seem to not read the fine print when flying with Wizz Air - or any carrier. It's extremely common for a low cost carrier to charge for airport check-in. Ryanair has been doing this for decades, as has Wizz Air. My experiences with Wizz Air have be nothing but absolutely fine. Prerequisite is knowning what you're up for. The only thing that could be better is their quite unconvenient flying times from Vilnius and the legroom. Staff on any flight I took with Wizz are always pleasant and helpful, if maybe not very friendly.

### Wizz Air customer review
A very decent flight from Riga to London Luton airport. The plane was clean, the seats were okay for a 2 hour 30 min flight. The cabin crew were polite and kept smiling which always makes the flight more enjoyable. Food that you can purchase on board was good for a low cost airline. Overall the flight was good with very a polite cabin crew. I recommend flying WizzAir

### Wizz Air customer review
Not knowing what to expect, given that Wizzair is rated as a 3-star low cost airline, I ended up being very disappointed. Check-in at the airport cost me an extra 10 Euros, which I find appalling, as I was unable to check-in online. As a result, my mother and I ended up sitting roughly 20 rows apart. Flight attendants were rude and unhelpful. During the boarding process, I was forced to pay 65 Euros because of excess baggage. My mother was forced to squeeze her purse into my hand luggage. Upon kindly asking for help, the Wizzair check-in agent (who was in charge of boarding) rudely replied, saying that it is not her problem. Seats on board were unconfortable, making it impossible to lie down, even with the two seats next to you being unoccupied. Wizzair's low fares will never impress me again. As the old saying goes - you get what you pay for.

### Wizz Air customer review
Wizz Air treat their customers as a nothing more than somebody to extract more money from. Not big bucks, just a nickel and dime for everything. Its actually more irritating than it is expensive. We were flying from Katowice, Poland to Frankfurt Hahn, Germany in July. But we are a family of 4, so the nickels and dimes add up. Wizz Air "closed" their online check-in 3 hours before the flight. Then they made us pay US$10 per person to print a boarding pass. We are a family of 4, so US$40. It was just such an amateur attempt at extracting small money. But, they were very successful at extracting the money, because you're not getting on the plane without paying. We were 4 of about 15 people on the flight in the same boat. I lived in eastern Europe in the 90's and Wizz Air is still in that Eastern Europe 1990's small time, rent seeking mind set. We were disappointed.

### Wizz Air customer review
I guess many people just don't read what is written on the website. If you're travelling with a budget airline, then please double check what procedures to follow. Like the rules for hand luggage (you need to pay for anything bigger than a backpack). For me, flying with 2 friends, experience was ok. Plane departure was 40 minutes later than planned, due to a bird that flew into the engine. Check-in as well as boarding went smoothly, cabin crew was friendly. Only minus was the legroom in the plane. As a guy who's 1.93m it was not so comfortable, but it was a kind of short flight. For my next flight I booked seats with extra legroom which is also not so expensive with this carrier. Big advantage is that you can check in online 30 days before departure and that it's very cheap of course!

### Wizz Air customer review
Uncomfortable seats, only a couple of millimeters of padding, if at all. There is also a metal rod at the front edge of the seat which is raised, pressing against the back of the knees. We have informed the crew about the seats every time yet the problem persists, in fact it has got worse. Crew can get snappy, even rude at times, particularly if you ask for what you paid for. Eg: They sometimes put other passengers in the most expensive seats for which you paid (among the first 6 seats), asking you to choose another seat and accept a refund or leave it, without apologising for the inconvenience, yet insisting that they followed procedure and good conduct. If only it was cheap but, it's far from it most of the time.

### Wizz Air customer review
The customer service at the airport is nothing to write home about. The policy seems like a punishment for those who chose to fly with them. Mistakes of any kind are fined heavily and the staff are rude if you ask for the simplest explanation.

### Wizz Air customer review
Wizz Air allocated seats. Booked a three adults and two infants flight and we're all sitting apart. Complete lack of customer care.

### Wizz Air customer review
Here I am at Sofia airport waiting for my flight to Dubai and I am fuming. I checked in online earlier like I always do, came to the airport presented my mobile but airport staff referred me to the check in counter saying that Sofia airport does not accept mobile passes. At the Wizz Air check in counter, a very 'nice' lady who barely speaks any English bluntly asked me to pay 35 euros to issue the boarding pass, saying that's their policy and that every person who checks in online and do not have the paper printed in A4 need to pay 35 euros to issue a boarding pass. Although I had made this trip with Wizz Air from Dubai airport to Sofia a week ago and as in every single airline experience I've had I either printed a boarding pass from the self check in machines, took it from check in counter or showed the mobile boarding pass. I have never been asked to pay for a boarding pass and 35 euros for a piece of paper! I asked for a printer to print my online pass but they just shrugged saying they don't have any. When asked about why this fee didn't apply in Dubai airport, the lady simply said that the Dubai airport staff must be making a mistake. I am told that had I not checked in online I would have gotten my boarding pass with no charge. And that because I was being efficient and making ground staff life easier by checking in online, I am supposed to pay a completely ridiculous charge.

### Wizz Air customer review
I've been travelling with Wizz Air for many years. Compared to Ryanair it always seemed better but I'm about to fly with Wizz Air again this year and the more I hear the more unhappy I am. They seemed to be interested only in money and don't care about their passengers. The cabin baggage - even Ryanair has a reasonable cabin baggage allowance. With Wizz Air the cabin bag is so small, you can barely fit anything in and if you want to upgrade to the size of the one Ryanair transports for free, you have to pay. Now, Wizz Air came up with the allocated seating idea (not the first airline, of course) and we thought since we bought the tickets all at once it shouldn't be a problem - wrong! We are all seated apart and it's not that the aircraft is full, only Wizz Air wants us to purchase the seats for us to sit together. I found this appalling!

### Wizz Air customer review
Unlike most others, I enjoy this airline, it's cheap and fast. An inflight wifi system would be great and some inflight information (location and time) would be appreciated. Also their payment system might be weird with all of the add-ons, but you can fly cheaply with this airline (if you skip all the extra stuff).

### Wizz Air customer review
I didn't even succeed in making a booking! This company is the worst I have ever encountered in any field in the whole of my life. Their online booking system is a joke. It just does not work! Anyone who experienced the same online booking problems that I encountered would just give up. I could not even enter my date of birth, and when I finally got to the payment section after three hours of trying, two of my credit cards were refused despite being asked for the advanced security codes. My recommendation to Wizz Air is just to give up. I have only selected a rating of 1/10 because I could not register 0/10.

### Wizz Air customer review
Not only was this airport (Beauvais, an hour outside of Paris) in the middle of nowhere, incredibly outdated, but if you needed help from anyone for that matter, you were usually left lost and confused. I tried to print out my boarding pass online and even paid for it, however, it showed an error and I was not able to do so. I was charged 40 euros to print out my boarding pass at the airport. Forced to pay another 40 euros to check my bag because it was 2 kg overweight and though I offered to take items out, she said I could not carry them in a plastic bag, for that would count as an additional bag. We started lining up for boarding at 8.30, 30 minutes after the departure time. I am also disgusted that you have to pay for water onboard. 4 euros for a tiny bottle of water. When I handed the flight attendant my credit card, she told me that they didn't accept cards.

### Wizz Air customer review
I was charged €45 to have my boarding pass printed at the airport as there was no option for electronic ticket or self service check in. I shoved them the booking number from my mobile phone but they didnt help. Very bad hidden cost - everything else was the same you get from a lowcost air transport company.

### Wizz Air customer review
Not much different from easyjet in terms of cost or comfort. However, beware of all their hidden costs. I was charged €40 to have my boarding pass printed at the airport (something easyjet don't do) as there was no option for electronic ticket or self service check in. I could have printed it myself before flying of course but I was travelling when I booked the flight so thought getting from the airport would be my easiest option. Then before boarding the plane, which was a complete disorganised mess, I was told my hand luggage was too big and would have to pay €70. I knew for a fact it was within the correct measurements stated on their website and even had a tape measure with me. Funnily enough it didn't fit into their little box you use to test if it's the right size but I knew it was within the correct measurements so suggested I take out my tape measure and show them. This shut the woman up as she obviously knew the test box wasn't true to he size of the overhead lockers. Eventually, after a lot of attitude from staff I got through with my bag. Like easyjet they only allow one bag, no matter how small the second is, but they were much more strict in enforcing this than easyjet. I saw one man made to empty out the contents of his second bag and carry it all (bag included) in his arms.

### Wizz Air customer review
Very disorganized and poorly managed airline with atrocious customer care. The disorganization is what stupefies me because isn't being organized what breeds efficiency and therefore cost savings? Had us check in online and print boarding pass which makes complete sense but then we hs to go through check in to get a new boarding pass anyway- how does that make sense? Check in line is same as bag drop, so it's wildly inefficient, 45 min wait (and employment of personnel that could have been avoided!). Charging us for priority boarding but then everyone gets stuffed on the same bus so everyone had to hurl themselves to the aircraft at the same time anyway- so what am I paying for? And yes you have to hurl yourself to the aircraft because the baggage compartment for the "priority" seats is taken up by the luggage of the personnel so the "priority" passengers have nowhere to leave their luggage. Their flights are too crammed together in that there isn't enough time between the landing of the aircraft and the next takeoff so there are delays. Because organisation is awful we all get jammed into the bus to be taken to the aircraft (no aircon, bus stuffed), but the aircraft isn't ready so we sit and wait for 10min+ in the bus and struggle to breathe. I have traveled Wizzair on numerous occasions out of necessity (timing or only direct flight) and these same issues occur again and again so it's not a one- off. If you can avoid them, do.

### Wizz Air customer review
They try to make money on everything, starting from the long and tedious online booking process with lots of pages asking you to explicitly select extra options for some charge. Then there is a tricky cabin baggage policy, which unlike any other airline I've used charges you for the standard-sized cabin baggage (typically 55x40x20) as for the "large cabin baggage". I have never encountered this before and didn't pay attention during the booking. As it turned out, I was not the only one - at the airport during boarding most of the passengers were standing in a queue confused why they had to pay extra £25.50 per standard cabin bag.

### Wizz Air customer review
Worst airline I have experienced. We could not check-in online and they took 45 euro at airport (more expensive than the tickets itself) just to check us in along with and 90 euros for a cabin bag.

### Wizz Air customer review
We are frequent travelers who are pretty organized with our bookings and always check airline policy. Firstly they did not allow us to check in online - so we could not print our boarding passes, which costed us 35 Euro per person. Travelling with a family of 7, that was definitely not cheap. Not to mention when we got there, they told us 5 of us can go for sure, the other 2 passengers will be on standby because they overbooked. At this point we were already pretty annoyed, but chose to stay calm. The airport staff was not able to even help us deal with this all because they were not Wizzair staff. So all in all a terrible experience.

### Wizz Air customer review
Had a terrible experience at check in. My wife and I are in our sixties and are frequent air passengers. Each of us had a small suitcase and backpack. We were informed that we had to pay 120 euros for excess baggage. The supervisor was rude. The flight itself was adequate. Will not be flying Wizz Air again.

### Wizz Air customer review
I was extremely angry about being charged the extra baggage fee for cabin bags, and the staff were rude when they charged the fee. 45 euro for each and we two persons paid 90 euro in total. I have taken many flights over several years, and never been charged for this kind of small cabin bag, even on many other cheap airlines. There was no apparent reason for it. It was just a cynical ploy to earn an extra bit of money. I won't be travelling with Wizz Air again.

### Wizz Air customer review
One of the better low-cost airlines, but you need to make sure you are organized. Cabin bag the right size otherwise you will slow yourself (and the system) down - hold luggage meets requirements (32kg limit is the most generous of any low-cost airline I know). Check-in online, not at the airport. The ground-handling is low-rent and sometimes waiting on stairs is unpleasant (except once at Christmas when some passengers sang carols). This is one of the worst things about Wizz. But a bit better if you buy Priority Boarding. Flights often do not leave on time but may catch up in the air. The aircraft are modern, clean, and have leather seats. I travel with Wizz Air frequently and I note small and steady improvements as time passes. I see a number of angry reviews of Wizz but I guess that these writers are not a representative sample of the average customer experience. Summary, it's okay.

### Wizz Air customer review
Rynair is a luxury comparing to Wizz Air. They will charge you for every thing, no customer focus whatsoever! Staff were rude and unhelpful. We fly for business all the time and made a massive mistake booking with them. We would rather pay a bit more but feel like we are being looked after or even fly to Modlin airport and pick the hire car from there.

### Wizz Air customer review
If you are going with them, you need to learn all their rules. Check in online, go without luggage (or a medium size backpack), don't order anything on the plane, etc. This way I got tickets for less than 50EUR to various destinations.

### Wizz Air customer review
We went to Ciampino airport 3 hours early and tried to open the Wizz Air site online to print our boarding passes, but surprisingly the site did not allow us to do it. When we questioned the female staff, she answered in a very rude manner, we could not get the boarding passes 3 hours before the flight - so we needed to pay 35euros per person. Do yourself a favor do not travel with Wizz Air.

### Wizz Air customer review
I had never heard of Wizz Air before but as the flight timings worked out for us - we selected this airline. Beware, they will find every single little thing to charge you on if something isn't done properly! They closed online check in earlier than they should have - so we were charged £25 pp to have the tickets printed at the airport. For the return journey I made sure to check in the moment I arrived in Budapest to avoid this situation again. However on the return leg, as my mum's hand luggage bag was perfectly fine for the overhead compartment but too big to fit under the seat in front she was charged £40. Whilst some may say it's our fault we didn't check the requirements, we assumed as we weren't challenged about the bag going to Budapest, we wouldn't have any problems on the way back. Also - this is a Standard hand luggage bag which my mum uses around the world without any quibbles. The customer service of the Wizz Air staff was awful. Other passengers had issues with their luggage and tickets - all had reasonable excuses, yet there was no empathy from the staff at all. My 60 year old mum needed some assistance placing her bag in the locker. The flight attendant refused. I know things like this aren't compulsory but I can't help but think that when airline staff go above and beyond (or at least appear to!) - this will encourage people to fly again with them. You're better off paying slightly more for a major airline like BA - and having better customer service.

### Wizz Air customer review
Very disappointing experience. The airline charged $20 to allow a small roll bag on board - but than you cannot take the usual personal item, i.e. backpack to be placed under the seat. And you have to arrange even that online, at check-in the price twice of that. After navigating through the airline's website I managed to pay for the carry-on bags. It did not occur to me that at that point I was not checked in! How can I pay for my carry on bag if I am not checked in for the flight? I certainly missed that option. It was a surprise when at the airport we were charged $50 per person for a boarding pass as I have apparently selected on-line check-in but did not complete the process. At boarding time we were directed to a hangar - a hot, airless building that looked appropriate to herd cattle. That is exactly how we felt we were treated by the airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
Wizz Air is hands down the worst airline in all areas - customer service, in-flight experience, ground handling, ticketing and claims - it is the least family-friendly airline to travel with. Airline staff are inexperienced, and not interested in serving customers. The airline should be avoided at all costs on flights lasting longer than 1 hour - the seats are worse than those on a bus in Central America. Flights are frequently cancelled.

### Wizz Air customer review
BUD-Luton-BUD but other flights as well recently. Check-in was effective staff attentive and friendly I purchased extra legroom and there was enough space. I am based in Budapest and travel on business frequently. When flying within Europe I prefer to fly budget airlines - primarily Wizzair Ryanair to a lesser extent over legacy/full service carriers: 1) Wizzair flies early and late during the day allowing a full day of work at destination. Hate flying into destinations where budget airlines do not fly e.g. Zurich where the first flight from Budapest arrives after 11 am and the last one leaves at 5 pm. 2) Wizzair breaks down the difference between economy and business into specific services that you can purchase individually (priority boarding extra legroom lounge more luggage etc.). Thus you can travel effectively on business within Europe picking what you want for prices lower than economy ticket on legacy airlines. 3) They are cheap (for the most part). 4) They have some of latest bag drop-off times allowing one to start off for the airport later and time is money. Flying from smaller airports also means shorter check-in times (although sometimes offset by these airports being farther from cities). 5) Their policies actually make sense: I have no sympathy for those who wish to bring on board their wooden trunks and carpet bags on boards. They take up precious on space on board and slow down boarding. You should pay dearly for this or check them in! Also having no reserved seats encourages passengers to finish boarding fast.

### Wizz Air customer review
My wife travelling from the UK to Kiev and back again with no problems at all the flights were on time yes you have to print your boarding passes but thats not rocket science most airlines are the same. And yes the food and drinks are expensive so take your own. Will use this airline again its half the price of BA.

### Wizz Air customer review
May 10th 2015 Milan Bergamo to Prague. Flight W6 2682. This airline is a money grabber charging us $200 just to print the boarding passes. We (party of 4) checked in a week earlier when they sent us an email and saved our boarding passes in PDF format on the ipad. As this is what we do instead of printing it and wasting paper. But they insisted that we need to print it at the check out counter. I tried using my phone to send the passes to the printer but it did not work and our flight was getting closer. They charged us $200 just to print out the passes ($50 each). On top of that one of the cabin bags was over the dimension so we had to fork out another $60 just to carry it our self on board. This I realize is my own mistake not to carefully read the dimensions they gave us assuming that it would be the same as rest of the airlines. Their allowable size is tiny and most of the people had to fork out extra as even a centimetre extra would not work. The plane had no assigned seating and had the smallest leg room I have seen on any airline. The padding on the seat was the thinnest I have seen. I have traveled about 60 airlines in 6 continents and this airline is the worst.

### Wizz Air customer review
I flew from Bergen Norway to Riga Latvia. The trip began on a negative note as I was charged approximately 30 euros for a boarding pass at the airport which I did not appreciate since the airline did not even have the decency to advise me by email that check-in was available on-line. To complicate matters they couldn't process my credit card so I had to pay using my debit card. The flight itself was uneventful except that I have never experienced such cramped leg room despite having flown other budget airlines in the past. I would not recommend this airline nor fly it again.

### Wizz Air customer review
Wizz Air managed to ruin my lovely weekend spent with friends and family! Me and my fiancee were travelling from Budapest back to London but never again. The reason why I usually choose cheap flights for this route that it is direct. But from now I will only travel with the rival air company! The official cabin bag size turn out to be too big and made us pay an extra £37 fee and the ground crew was also very rude to us. So thank you for the worst flight experience I have had!

### Wizz Air customer review
Travelled from London to Ljubljana with 3 children. Paid small fee for priority boarding. Check in staff excellent as were cabin crew. Seats fine. Flight left about 10 mins late but made up the time. Watch the carry on rules - they are very clear but differ slightly from other airlines. Found booking process easy to follow for most part. One minor hiccup to watch for is that it is unclear whether middle names are required and there is no box for this. They are required - to match passport name. Their call centre fixed this in about 5 mins. Good value for money and would travel with them again.

### Wizz Air customer review
16 March 2015 flight 1306 Luton-Warsaw. 20 March 2015 flight 1305. Terrible experience. Priority boarding is a waste of money as they ignore it and treat you like cattle Seat room is the worst I have ever experienced. Seat backs were heavily damaged by previous customers trying to get legs in or frustrated by lack of space. Do not fly with these people. Dreadful.

Flew Milan to Budapest it was a comfy flight and a good overall experience. Would fly again great price.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew Prague to Luton with Wizz Air for the first time and unfortunately fell victim to large cabin baggage and therefore had to pay £60 to board with our luggage - which incidentally is small enough with respect to other non- frill flights with EasyJet and RyanAir. Please check their baggage limitations when purchasing tickets - the small baggage allowance included in the basic ticket price is limited to rucksacks and very small hand luggage. The plane we were on was old and had appalling leg room for the standard seats. I am only 5ft 10 and really struggled to get comfortable in any way. Fortunately the flight time was around 1.5 hrs although the flight was also delayed one hour. On-board staff were friendly and attentive. Flights were booked a month in advance and were fairly expensive at £190 per person.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew Wizzair from Luton to Budapest as long as you stick to the hand luggage rules and do not have multiple or large items. You can have 32 kg in the hold which is generous coaches to and from plane have improved hangar experience. The pilots and crew do not communicate a great deal and providing you accept its a no frills airline it offers good value for money with a wide choice of destinations.

### Wizz Air customer review
I have been flying DTM-CRA-DTM on Wizzair last week and have been very satisfied with the value for money. Both flights were on time and I arrived at the destination even earlier than expected. I was aware of the low seat pitch before but even as I am taller than 1.90m it was no problem for me to sit at the window for a two hour flight even if there was no seat free next to me. The drinks and snacks on board have a reasonable pricing and the staff was always friendly. Would definitely fly again on Wizz Air!

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton to Budapest. Absolutely no problems at all got the extra leg room option which gives priority boarding. This meant we got on first and had large comfy seats and no stress. Nobody sat next to us so had loads of room. Plane was new clean and on time. Only issue we had was being corralled into a concrete shed with no facilities at Budapest airport which seemed a cruel way to treat anyone. Ryan air did the same though and their plane was late. I see loads of other complaints but if you actually read the instructions have the right sized luggage and print boarding passes before you go it's hard to go wrong.

### Wizz Air customer review
Fantastic experience. Everything clearly stated for example we had to check in online print boarding pass and that baggage allowance was small. Amazing luggage allowance of 32kg! Flights on time and very pleasant staff.

### Wizz Air customer review
On the 17th February I flew from Luton airport to Budapest with my wife using our 2 standard cabin size bags which are recommended by most budget airlines. I used these last year on easyjet and Ryanair with no problems. This time on the outward flight all went fine. Things were very different on the homeward journey. At Budapest airport a very abrasive Wizz Air employee ask to see my boarding passes and then informed me that my bags were too large and that I had to pay £70 extra for them. She had a very unfriendly attitude and there was no discussion to be had. If I wanted the bags on the plane I had to pay £70. This was almost as much as our fares cost. A very unhappy end to a nice trip away. I don't consider Wizz to be a good airline to fly with. Any airline who set the case sizes fractionally smaller than the standard set by everyone else do so for one reason and one reason only. To catch out their customers. If you want to be taken for a flight and not taken for a ride use another airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
My partner and I have used Wizz many times generally without problems like all cheap no frills or thrills airlines you have to be careful about their rules we use Easy Jet Ryanair and Norwegian.com all good but you must read the small print! All have different rules. We have flown to Gdansk Warsaw Wroclaw and Poznan all without much fuss. N.B. the ground staff at Luton are not employed directly by Wizz so they are not bothered fail to make announcements at the gate so there is often a 'bun fight' to get in the right queue for speedy boarding etc. We have paid for the speedy boarding and large cabin bag as we fly often to Poland and this will last for up to 18 months so well worth it for us. We do find on Wizz that some people don't know how to behave on flights yanking on your seat back knees in back etc... so we always sit in the last row!

### Wizz Air customer review
TGM-BUD-TGM in January 2015. Onward flight was OK as usual with low-cost airline no free service onboard but flight on time even arrived 5-10 minutes earlier. Flight back - baggage drop was a nightmare incompetent clerks sent us from one to another in Budapest airport to verify our small cabin bag: they just wanted to collect more money for oversized bag. With us it did not work but was annoying anyhow. Flight itself was OK and on time.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flight from London Luton to Craiova. I paid GBP 471 for the ticket and I got very poor comfort. Chewing gum on the seat. My flight was delayed. All passengers was complaining because the flight was diverted to another airport. Bad experience with Wizzair.

### Wizz Air customer review
We had just finished our wonderful trip in Budapest getting ready to fly home with Wizzair at 6am we get to the airport and as we were unable to get access to the internet for 3 days we thought we would self-check in at the airport. We were shocked to find out that we had to pay an extra £40 per person to print off the boarding pass. After getting over the shock we paid and went on our way to check in to only be stopped and say we had to put our small handbags in our carry on bags so we did. Finally trying to make our way to security we were rudely told to go back to the desk with no explanation. We were then informed that our carry on luggage was too big and we had to pay an extra £45 each not to be checked under the plane but just to take it on board with us (making no sense to me). Why pay extra for a bag that could already be taken on. Anyway by this stage we were getting close to our boarding gate opening and closing and still had to go through security fearing even more payment of missing a flight we asked if there was anyway we could get a quicker route through security they informed us it was another 5 euro each for fast track We said we would pay to only be informed that they could only take cash which we did not have. So we wait in Security line then sprint to just make our boarding gate. I have never come across such rude and unhelpful staff. When asking what time our boarding gate closes the response I got was 'I don't know' there were multiple workers just sitting there with attitude and no urgency about them.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew Baku - Budapest return for an insane price - 40 Euros. Bare bones. Quick weekend get away so packed light. No problems. I was not prepared for the cattle drive like boarding terminal in Budapest.

### Wizz Air customer review
I travel to Sofia Bulgaria from Luton Airport 3 or 4 times a year and generally speaking I find Wizz Air about the best of the 'Cheap' airlines. The real complaint I have is probably with Luton Airport - like a previous customer said I find it incredible the way the Wizz Air Passengers are treated like cattle at the check In. We are told to go to a Gate No only to be kept waiting for sometimes an hour often standing on the stairs before boarding the plane. I am sure every Wizz Air passenger has experienced this I know I have maybe about 14 or 15 times.

### Wizz Air customer review
I flew Wizz Air from Kyiv (Zhulyany) Ukraine to Katowice Poland and I think because this is the Ukraine WizzAir which still has some 'frills'. The cabin was clean and departure prompt. Arrival was ahead of schedule. Check in baggage was included in fare. There was no passport check upon boarding in Zhulyany. Zhulyany has bus connections to central Kyiv however the bus does not go up to the terminal and as a result I had to get a bus back to the airport after getting off in a village somewhere outside of Kyiv. There was an applause upon landing which I had been told to expect in CIS countries. I think as long as you comply with the rules you have no problems. I have also flown Wizz Air from Cluj Napoca (Romania) to Luton (UK) and saw people being charged for over size hand baggage.

### Wizz Air customer review
Return flight from Madrid-Budapest. Both ways we didn't have problems the airplanes were new we departed just 15 minutes after the original schedule and didn't have problems with our hand luggage. I think that if you travel budgets airlines you must try to follow their rules if you don't want any problems.

### Wizz Air customer review
For most airlines my bag is small but for Wizz Air it was 2cm too large - had to pay an extra 40 Euros. The way the staff spoke and acted is rude. After paying I saw other people pass with visibly bigger bags - which is annoying. I am very disappointed.

### Wizz Air customer review
I was pleasantly surprised by Wizz Air having read the reviews on here before I travelled. Our outgoing flight from Doncaster to Riga was delayed by an hour because of snow in Riga but that would probably have been the case with any airline. The plane itself seemed almost brand new and leg room was certainly no worse than other budget airline. Staff were friendly and both flights were smooth and event free (the return flight arrived on time too). Really can't complain for a £40 flight!

### Wizz Air customer review
I flew from Luton to Budapest and back. What people have to remember is that this is a low-cost airline. I have no objections against the flights themselves. Both flights were on time. The pilot spoke to us both times. The cabin crew was friendly and professional. I couldn't comment on food as I didn't have any. The gates are usually located at the further end of the airport but also this is normal for low cost and people have to anticipate this. I was only carrying one piece of hand luggage as allowed. Before my travel I checked on the website and my bag was within their allowed measurements. On the Luton airport no problem no bags were checked. On the way back however the issues started. I was pulled aside to try and fit it in their stand which appeared much smaller than the measurements stated on their website. There were many people with bags just as big as mine was yet only me and a couple more people were pulled aside. They let the other ones through no problem. So I was asked to pay for the excess which I did. I would only recommend it if you travel light.

### Wizz Air customer review
I wasn't expecting much considering this is a budget airline. So the slight delay on both flights from Warsaw to Luton and back were acceptable (up to an hour) as was the disorganised boarding cramped seats (no legroom) non reclining seats spotty cabin service some staff not great at English etc. That was all fine. You get what you pay for after all. What really threw me off was the fact that a bag that was at first within their tiny small allowed luggage size grew! I was charged £35 for a bag I had very carefully measures beforehand and that was cleared on a previous flight. I can tolerate stringent rules but only when they are actually followed. Never flying with them again if I can avoid it.

### Wizz Air customer review
BUD-IEV and back. My experience of Wizz Air was quite positive since I got acquainted with the airline only this year. On the way there the plane was very comfortable good legroom with real leather seats. Besides the military- type tent used for boarding at BUD the experience was very fine. In Kiev W6 flies to Zhuliany airport which is located right in the urban area making it a really easy and painless transfer unlike KBP which is a lot more distant. On the way back plane 100% full. The pilot seemed in a bit of a haste rough braking after landing that broke the jubilant applause not a single announcement during the flight FA's (or at least one of them) very charming got offered the exit-seat despite being one of the last to board. Recommended although the price is far from competitive on this particular route.

### Wizz Air customer review
Was worried about flying with this airline after reading reviews. However for a low cost airline and for a short flight my sister and I didn't have any problems. Check in was straightforward we took one case between us which was £20 each way and could have a total of 32 kilos. Even we couldn't get that much in the case! There's not much legroom between the seats but for an 1.5 hour flight Luton/Prague it was fine. It was on time on both outward and return journeys. What's not to like for a budget airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
London Luton to Sofia 26th Oct return 29th Oct. Both flights on time. Boarding conducted in an orderly manner. Seats were basic but adequate for 3 hour flight they do not recline which is good because legroom is at a premium. Good value for money. My only minor complaint was for buying 2 drinks for EUR 4 giving a EUR 5 note and receiving a 50p back in change! Good exchange rate - not!

### Wizz Air customer review
PRG to LTN flight W6 2601 October 25th. The flight itself was unremarkable and only slightly late into Luton but the boarding process was a disgrace. Called forward to the gate we were loaded onto a large Cobus transport. There was no control as to the number allowed onto the vehicle and despite a second Cobus waiting more and more people climbed aboard the first bus until we were crammed in like sardines. We were then left standing there in considerable discomfort for twenty minutes before the Cobus left for the 'plane. The second Cobus with far fewer passengers followed us and at the aircraft those second vehicle passengers were allowed to board. We stood for a further five minutes before being allowed onto the 'plane by which time the second lot of passengers had had first choice of the seats on this free-seating flight. I'm not young anymore and forty-eight hours later my back is still killing me.

### Wizz Air customer review
Very claustrophobic - hardly any leg room on board and I say that as a relatively small person. We were penned into a cold stairwell to wait for 45 mins before boarding which was uncomfortable and smelly. The tickets were cheap but the airline seemed to go out of its way to make the experience as wretched as possible.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew from Doncaster/Sheffield (UK) to Katowice (Poland) on 1st October. My wife and I arrived at check in which proceeded smoothly friendly staff and we were efficiently processed. Called to gate and queued as usual but we were all onboard and took off just 10 mins after scheduled time. Seats were good leg room ok. Crew friendly busy and efficient. Pilot chatty and the flight was smooth. Good landing after 2 hrs 10 mins. Returned on 6th Oct. Again check in painless friendly and efficient. Called to gate Boarded and took off exactly on schedule. Again cabin crew friendly and efficient. Would fly again.

### Wizz Air customer review
The flight was delayed again. I've flown the Gdansk-Malmoe route 4 times (2 round trips) and every time the flight was delayed. Two of those times I just barely managed to catch the last train from Gdansk. There was also no mention or acknowledgement of the delay on board and the flight attendant looked offended when I pointed this out. I appreciate Wizzair's pricing but such a level of customer service is unacceptable.

### Wizz Air customer review
Wizz Air is a cheap way to travel. I had no cabin bag issues but others did. But to be fair to Wizz they stuck to their policy. I flew Luton to Gdansk return. On the outbound leg leg room was poor. On the return leg it was terrible. My knees were wedged into the seat back which was a plastic panel broken previously by wedged knees. Next time I'll pay for the upgrade which would still make the flight inexpensive.

### Wizz Air customer review
I flew W6 2445 from Budapest to Corfu on 07/09. The lowest price for this destination. Good value for money. Plane took off and landed on time without any delay. I liked walking at Budapest Ferihegy Airport from the building to the airplane. The plane was in a good condition - everything worked well.

### Wizz Air customer review
W6 3302 London Luton - Cluj-Napoca 11 Sep 2014. W6 3301 Cluj-Napoca - London Luton 15 Sep 2014. Dreadful airline. I've travelled through extremely poor areas of the world and have never experienced such shocking service filthy damaged planes and rude members of staff. It makes Ryanair seem like a dream! Fly easyjet or any other low cost carrier.

### Wizz Air customer review
Bucharest (OTP) - Malta (MLA) return. Very good value for money I have travelled with them a lot of times and I'm very happy to say I consider their service quite good keeping in mind that this a ULLC airline. You get what you pay for if you don't need a checked-in bag or on-board catering you don't need to spend your money on it. I have not experienced any unreasonable delay although I have travelled with them 30+ times in the last couple of years. The FA's are nice and welcoming the boarding takes place fast thanks to the small cabin bag policy and none of the seats can be reclined. The ground services are good as they use the main airport in Bucharest (OTP). Smaller airports like Treviso or Cuneo can be crowded while you are waiting to board the aircraft but this compensates with faster security checks. My best flights were from Bucharest to Madrid Barcelona Ciampino Bergamo Eindhoven Charleroi Catania Malta and I will soon travel on the new flights to Malaga and Malmo. If you are looking for a fast no-frills way to travel WZZ is a good choice.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew LTN-SOF on W6 4302 26 August 2014. 21.50 dep. I did web check-in which was easy and as I was hand baggage only I could go straight to security. I had paid extra for the "Large Hand Baggage" and was surprised that no one seemed to be checking hand baggage sizes at the gate. They called us to the gate about 40 mins before departure. Then we stood for ages with no activity until after our Scheduled departure time and there are no seats at this gate (21) in Luton. Once boarding started it went without drama and they boarded at both front and rear steps so it was fast. I had not paid extra for Priority Boarding but was about 35-40th passenger to board so I had no problem finding a window seat or overhead locker space. The aircraft interior was clean and smart and seats comfortable enough even though they did not recline. However the seat pitch on standard seats was awful and made it very uncomfortable. I think it's a similar pitch to European charter airlines flying within Europe. We departed 30 mins late. The crew were courteous and reasonably friendly. I thought the inflight buy on board was good value. Euro 4.00 for a large (250 ml) fairly decent tasting glass of wine. (Much cheaper than in Luton airport). Despite our late departure we arrived on time. Disembarkation was swift via a one minute bus ride and then quickly through immigration and customs. Overall it was ok value for money but it was not comfortable. Though I still don't understand why they called us to the gate so early and made us all stand for so long if they were nowhere near ready for us to board.

### Wizz Air customer review
My family and I have flown them 25-30 times this year since we moved to Budapest and have to frequently visit home in the Netherlands. Very few positives. Hard uncomfortable seats zero recline confined spaces miserable departure "hall" particularly unpleasant ground personnel all softened slightly by more pleasant cabin staff and no major delays. Last flight from Budapest to Eindhoven on 29 Aug and return following day made me decide to quit them for - almost - good. Traveled with spouse and booked their "Large" cabin luggage. Went to check-in area with the same trolley that I have traveled with countless times put it in the bin for inspection and got acceptance sticker affixed on it. Agent at boarding decides to verify again and overrules his colleague at check-in. According to him height is 1cm in excess and thus charges airport hold luggage fee of 70 euro but absurdly just lets us carry it with us on board. The fact that his colleague approved it was no excuse; he was the supervisor and has the power to overrule everybody. Requests to speak to his supervisor were rejected. On return flight from Eindhoven following day same trolley goes through same inspection and is again accepted without slightest hesitation. All in all I ended up paying broadly a KLM fare for a vastly inferior service. On the other hand Wizzair lost 40 to 50 legs a year between myself and my family.

### Wizz Air customer review
We didn't expect much given that it is a low cost airline. It was much worse than we'd expected. Both of our flights (Luton to Prague and Budapest to Luton) were slightly late. We paid for priority boarding and on our return flight waited in a long queue to check our bags although we had checked in online. After we had been in the queue for 30 minutes one of Wizz Air employees told us to move to the priority queue (which was much shorter) to check our bags. We left the longer queue and when we arrived at the shorter queue a very snotty employee told us to get back to the longer queue. Once through security we stood over 45 minutes in an airplane hangar waiting to board (after the gate was supposed to have been closed). Never again.

### Wizz Air customer review
We flew (family of 5) from BUD to DXB. Check in was busy but efficient and we booked priority boarding and the option of buying an empty seat space for several of us ensuring we all had room. This is an excellent offer that may not be available on all flights but the option always remains to go for the exit seats which offer more space. All of the hassle we witnessed at the airport was due to passenger errors whether trying to book 35kg bags in or taking luggage on board that did not conform to the guidelines which are very clearly outlined on the website. Several passengers did not appear to know whether they had checked in online or not and complained when they were charged the airport fee- again very clearly expressed online. Overall we got way above what was expected. Easy check in good boarding onto a smart newish aircraft good seat room delightful staff without consuming time with many of the unnecessary procedures other airlines insist upon on take off and landing. The staff were helpful attentive and still serving food and drinks 30 mins before arrival. It was a very pleasant experience and we would not hesitate to use Wizz Air again.

### Wizz Air customer review
Was dreading flying after reading some of these reviews. Flying between Doncaster and Gdansk and found it to be overall a pleasant experience. Staff very courteous throughout both journeys. Their baggage policy is a bit of a joke but as long as you abide by it there are no problems. Legroom is very limited even for someone who is 6ft I don't know how you would manage if you were any taller. Drinks and food seemed a reasonable price on board.

### Wizz Air customer review
Travel 6-8 time a year from Malmö to Budapest and find it very good. You most always read what is written on the web for any airlines. Wizzair have a nice web and easy to read all the extra for luggage.

### Wizz Air customer review
We booked a flight from Budapest to Rome on Wizz Air as the value appeared to be very good. When we arrived to check in we were charged first to check-in (I have never had that happen in the past with any airline) then we were charged for both checked and carry on bags. At the gate we were again charged for carry on bags in spite of having receipts for payment. The total check in and baggage charges were significantly higher that the price of the two tickets by more than 50%. Outrageous and very misleading. Travelled July 22 2014.

### Wizz Air customer review
It is a low-cost airline. You should not expect much. It was my first time taking a flight that was free seating. Pick whatever is available as soon as you get on board. Our flight was Dubai-Budapest-Dubai. On our BUD-DWC flight they intentionally left our hold luggage in BUD. It was not lost they just bumped it off intentionally because they needed to load more fuel. Our baggage arrived after 2 days and it was very inconvenient because we had to go back to the airport to pick it up and I live 150kms away from the airport! No in-flight entertainment and you have to buy your food. It was not a bad experience at all other than the baggage incident.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew from Luton to Katowice on July 30. Stupidly long check-in queues. Having eventually got to the desk I was informed that I had actually selected on-line check-in and because I hadn't done so I was going to be charged £30 each for myself and my partner. As if the extortionate initial charges weren't enough a £60 fee was then slapped on top of it. I don't at any point whilst booking this trip did I see a "select this and you must book on-line or you'll be charged £60" otherwise I would have clearly adhered to this. Just obviously another money making scheme. The guy behind the counter wasn't even sympathetic/apologetic. He looked like he couldn't care less. Not only this annoyance but with reference to paying this ridiculous fee we had to get out of the queue and go and pay elsewhere only to return to the initial queue. What a palaver. Then the flight itself - small and cramped. My boyfriend is 6ft 5 so it was all round an unpleasant and expensive experience. I will most definitely not be using this company again.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton to Skopje 21st returning on the 23rd for business. No other choices fare was expensive Luton long check ins where I had a "discussion" over the large cabin baggage I had purchased online that the check in agent disputed eventually accepting that I had paid it after showing them the invoice. Airbus A320 both ways. Full flight going out was moved thankfully to a seat with extra legroom the seats are extremely cramped. Staff professional both ways. Coming back delays at Luton getting off. Flight was late arriving with other aircraft's queuing for a gate. All in all guess like most LCA's looking at Wizz's destinations suspect that passenger experiences may well be affected by some of the lesser airports they are flying to.

### Wizz Air customer review
We flew TRF-SZZ and return in July. The plane was on time both ways and we were generally pleased even if security at SZZ on return flight was dreadfully slow. When flying Wizz you are truly on a budget airline but it works and you get what you pay for. We carefully read the luggage rules in advance and avoided paying extra that some of our colleague pax had to do. Seats are OK but if you are XL (like me) you should consider buying a seat with extra leg room. One concern is safety: crew permitted passengers to leave their seats during taxi. Not acceptable.

### Wizz Air customer review
Their handbag policy is the worst I've ever seen. A normal handbag that can be carried on with Ryanair Easyjet etc. Wizz Air considers it as too big. They proceed then to collect 45 euros. Many people had to pay. It seemed they just cared about collecting money. I will never choose this company again if I have another one to choose.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew from Luton to Vilnius return. The flights themselves were acceptable - condition of planes decent not much room in seats but I'm short so not a particular problem for me although I did hear taller passengers complaining. Lots of selling to passengers mid-flight but this is as you would expect from a budget airline. I personally did not have problems with baggage allowances but took care to read the online information carefully following the negative comments on this site. Where Wizz fell down for me was in the information provided to passengers at the airport - for both the outward and return journeys there were 60 minute delays with little information forthcoming as to why. The delay on the way home in particular was shocking - passengers were actually 'boarded' through the gate when the plane had not even reached Vilnius. This meant 200 people were kept cooped up between the gate and the runway in sweltering conditions with no access to water or WC's for an hour without any information as to why. Bad for people with kids in particular. This approach must have been taken purely for the convenience of the staff themselves - poor.

### Wizz Air customer review
We flew from Barcelona to Katowice on 7th July. Flight was delayed 4 hours due to bad weather in the morning and congestion at the airport afterwards which I understand. We were not offered any food voucher or beverages. It wasn't nice but I can afford 50 euros to buy us food (there were 3 of us). What was unacceptable was the customer service. First I had problems with my hand luggage despite me purchasing additional luggage for $160. The allowance in KG was 32kg my luggage weigh 20kg. Apparently they didn't like the size of my had luggage which weighed 3 kg as it only contained iPad travel documents and mask that I purchased in Venice. The size of the luggage is a typical suitcase for domestic flights in Australia (which btw I measured beforehand as I am very particular about things like this) which I have taken on Wizzair and Ryanair flights before without any issues. They asked me to place it into the cage and I did. It fitted except the wheels that stood above the cage. When I demanded the measuring tape to prove that the luggage is exactly the required size the Wizzair staff member raised his voice at me. I saw the arguments about the luggage before and I thought that maybe people were unreasonable but this case convinced me that Wizzair is. I don't intend to fly with them again.

### Wizz Air customer review
July 2 departure July 7 return. OTP-CIA and CIA-OTP. I flew WizzAir for the first time in July 2014 (to/from Bucharest-Rome CIA). The ticket price was low and great value. Both aircraft's were less than 2 years old and beautiful Flights were on time. I paid $6 extra for priority boarding which was a great value to find a good seat. I love the fact that they allow 32 kilos (about 70 lbs) and no size limit for checked baggage (cost $40). I would fly them again any day. One other thing - I like that the seats don't recline so you don't have the seat in front of you in your face.

### Wizz Air customer review
TGM to FMM and back flight on time (even 10-15 minutes before schedule) excellent staff good service on board (Wizz Cafe and Wizz boutique reasonable prices). One problem: poor ground service at FMM airport - without screen information only speaker and a person who ran from one group to another to orientate people (there was a flight to Belgrade in the same time) - I would say this was rather primitive. I met a similar situation at Madrid Barajas terminal 1 in May 2014.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew on June 14 2014 from Naples to Prague. We flew on this date because our original flight on June 16th was cancelled and we had to re book. Our flight from Naples was 5 hours late. The seats were not allocated so it was a scramble for seats in the economy class. Another issue is the allowed size of the luggage basically only a small soft backpack is accepted without an additional fee. Most of the passengers were told that their luggage is either too big or two heavy. We each had to pay additional 48 Euro for a small luggage. I purchased a new small luggage just for this flight had to pay anyway. I would never fly with this airline again.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-SOF and back. I flew with my wife and 3 year old kid. Didn't book anything extra and we had no problem at all (No delay no extra baggage fee). Cabin staff was pretty helpful and we could easily communicate in English. If you can handle your own online check-in and printings you don't meet any extra fee (they declare it many times when you book online).

The disorganisation in Luton airport was on a grand scale. Eight flights leaving with in one hour one large checking area for all the flights frantic customers with minutes to go before check ins closed begging to be let in to the front of the queue. Hundreds of very stress very angry people staff trying to cope and becoming abusive very bad.

### Wizz Air customer review
Have travelled with Wizz Air three times in the past 12-months from Luton to Budapest. On two occasions the flights were majorly delayed. My flight yesterday was the worst ever experienced in more than 30-years of travelling. Scheduled to leave at 20.25 it eventually left more than 12-hours later. No Wizz Air staff at the airport to provide any support or information. If at all possible avoid this airline. I will never fly with them again.

### Wizz Air customer review
I fly several times every year with Wizz from TGM or CLJ to different destinations (DTM FMM HHN BUD MAD FCO BCN). Usually I book extra legroom seats for 10-12 Euros extra and that includes priority boarding as well it is good value for money. Never had problems with luggage if you keep the rules (small cabin bag 42x32x25 cm for free) there is no problem. They have been almost always on time my last flight MAD-TGM was an exception-3 hours delay. MAD airport at terminal 1 does not announce boarding calls you must follow the displays. Wizz should have own representatives at all airports instead of paying services to the handling agents.

### Wizz Air customer review
The website is most user unfriendly. It has taken several attempts to actually book the flight. However trying to confirm the flight was very difficult. Unable to do it online I resorted to calling a premium rate phone line to achieve the result. At Luton airport the check in staff neither explained nor helped with my reserved seat. I was not informed to board by the front entrance. Eventually finding my way forward I was informed that the first three rows of seats are reserved to those paying the £7.00! The same was the case a Budapest. The main problem with the journey was to find the pick up point for the Bus transfer form the Airport to Budapest. It is situated nearly 2 km from the Terminal.

### Wizz Air customer review
During the last 3 years I have flown with Wizz Air at least 5 times a year. At least 15 flights from Tel Aviv to different destinations. I have never experienced any problems. All the flights were exactly as scheduled staff were polite and professional the seats were ok for the low cost flight. In general I think Wizz Air is an ideal low cost company especially for those who prefer 100% on-line handling. If one is able to schedule their flight well in advance then the price is also unbeatable. The only complaint: I have concerns with their new rules regarding free luggage allowances.

BEG-LCA and back. Boarding in Belgrade chaotic taking place in a small non-refurbished gate (A8) that can't fit the number of people on an A320 even though our flight wasn't full. Passengers behavior on board appalling same as the attitude of the stewards and FA's. The flight was like a flying bazaar Legroom is none. Takeoff and landing done in an unpleasant manner even though the weather was fine (I'm a frequent traveler). On return boarding at Larnaca gate 41 the one with the stairs. Many people got overcharged for hand-luggage. Crew attentive this time around and passengers well behaved. Got moved to the emergency seat for free. The pilot was a true professional landing excellent. As you can see Wizz Air can be hit and miss. To use only if you're light on luggage and able to respect the stingent rules that could easily make your "cheap" ticket skyrocket above the price of the one of a regular airline. Until a year ago Wizz Air Serbia was still allowing free checked-in luggage now only allowed with Wizz Air Ukraine.

### Wizz Air customer review
We took trip from Bergen to Riga. To Riga was no problems and no control on size of hand luggage. Back to Bergen was totally different in terms of control on hand luggage. Suitcase was 5 cm in height too large costs 40 euro extra. No discussion possible. We put all our bits in a plastic bag and threw out the suitcase. No service. If you look for all extra costs for (big) suitcase it is better to book a ticket with a regular airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
We did not even get a Hello or Goodbye when boarding and deplaning! We were tricked into paying an extra £35 for a standard cabin bag when they claimed it was too big. Many passengers with standard cabin bags were forced to pay they were making a fortune. When we got on the plane were told there were no seats unless we paid extra for a long seat I said we were not paying and were entitled to a seat so after moaning about it we were told we could sit in the long seats for free. We were herded like sheep all over the airport. Same on return flight no seat on plane unless we paid extra same again suddenly they found us a seat only someone under 5ft tall could manage in that seat it was awful. It was all about trying to make us pay extras for food drinks  priority boarding bigger seats check in baggage there was no customer service at all.

### Wizz Air customer review
The only reason I travel with them is they are the only reasonably priced airline to fly to Kosice otherwise I wouldn't touch them with a barge pole they make Ryanair seem pleasant. 3.5 hour delay on last flight only explanation was delayed incoming plane nothing else.

### Wizz Air customer review
I booked Wizz from Rome to Prague. They charged for my small rollerboard 50 Euros plus another 30.00 Euros for some hidden fee. I paid in charges more than the seat in cramped plane. Customer service was extremely rude. Never again with Wizz. I booked my way back with Czech airlines for the same price but a world of difference.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-WAW / BRU-BUD I increasingly use Wizzair for business trips on CEE routes. Make sure you book a reserved seat for £8 that gives priority boarding and access to 2 first rows (1st has more space then business class on most carriers) Also ensure you pay for "large" cabin bag as standard allowance is too small. Paying these small extras will make you fly like "business class" for a fraction of economy class on flag carriers and you can book last minute.

### Wizz Air customer review
London to Budapest on 27th March. Our flight was more less on time (15 mins late) but I could see on the display schedule that 2 other flights that day were delayed 2-3 hours each. Standing in a long queue found out that my little personal suitcase was too big to go onboard without paying a fee of £35. On the plane total mess no allocated seats. Personally I don't understand it as allocating the seats doesn't cost anything so? Unless it's a part of a scam and making extra money option (choose your seat). On board staff the most useless I have seen so far. I ordered Whisky for me and Gin for my partner got the bottles and the trolley with serving staff was gone! I had to ask for a glass to have a drink I ordered with them! I don't even want to start on the leg room. Terrible service the worst airline! Never again!

### Wizz Air customer review
Very disappointed to be surprised by a $250 charge by Wizz Air for not printing our boarding passes. The company indicates in the fine print that you may be charged a small fee. The company didn't even have the courage to charge us! They have a third party in the airport collecting the money!

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew LTN to Targu Mures (TGM) outbound on 21/3/2014 and return on 26/3/2014. Arrived in TGM ahead of time return 20 mins late at LTN. Both flights in clean aircraft with fairly attentive cabin crew. No complaints whatsoever have used them on this route three times and never a problem. You need to concentrate on the website when booking to make sure you only select what you want. The checked in baggage weight is quite generous. Seats are a bit tight but for only 3 hours I didn't find them a problem (you can always pay for extra legroom) Would recommend.

### Wizz Air customer review
Generally speaking I can say that the airplanes are quite good and clean traveling from Donetsk to Germany (Memmingen Dortmund) was cheap and easy. Why they cancelled the flights from and to Donetsk from Memmingen I don't have a clue. This is very bad but until now I could only recommend the airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
My wife and I flew from Budapest to Madrid on 23 Mar. We lined up for around an hour before even being able to enter the queue. We were then directed to one line where we waited for around 30 mins before being told that we would have to pay 30 euro each as we had not checked in online. The unapologetic server then directed us to line up in the other line. Just as we reached the front again the bomb squad found an abandoned bag so we were moved out of the queue (about an hour later). Once resolved we again lined up and finally checked in. Talk about making easy things hard. Throughout the staff were unhelpful and rude - probably comes with having to deal with irate passengers daily. After the Melee finally boarded the plane the flight was okay. No entertainment warm beers for 3 euro and no leg room you expect that with the budgets but the service is very poor. Never again.

### Wizz Air customer review
17 March 2014. Flight W62202 Luton to Budapest. I knew nothing about Wizz but was really pleasantly surprised! Crew really efficient and friendly. Seats comfortable and cabin looked very clean. Really could not fault the whole flight. I would certainly fly Wizz again and recommend it.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flight back from Budapest to Eindhoven. Bomb squad was busy so we had to wait for 45 minutes. Once the hall was cleared total chaos at check-in one lady was shouting around like she was managing cattle. My travel partner and I decide to grab some coffee as we were instructed in bad English to wait as other flights had priority this was 5.30 am! Once the queue dissolved we walked over to the check in and were told check in is closed and it was our problem as far as I'm concerned that was the last flight with Wizz.

### Wizz Air customer review
W63702 and 3701 5th Feb to 12th Feb 2014. I travel every two months to Romania taking Wizzair flights from Luton to Targu Mures. The flights are cheap especially if you join their Wizzair Club the staff are for the most part friendly and helpful although the flight staff are not always too easy to understand when using English. The seats are fairly cramped but for 2.5 hours this is not a great problem the luggage allowances need to be clearly studied but an allowance of 32kilos for hold luggage is generous. Hand luggage can therefore be quite minimal. It is always best to eat and drink before the flight as in-flight refreshments seem to be one of the ways the airline makes up for their cheap flights. Arrival and departure times are normally very close to target. My only real complaint is the long wait always experienced at the Luton departure gate always having to stand while the plane is being prepared. Why not call us when they are ready to take us on board? Using the airline at least 6 times a year I am happy to continue doing so.

### Wizz Air customer review
My friend and I flew from Madrid to Budapest return. Flight from Madrid to Budapest was delayed and incredibly noisy. Return was a nightmare: the luggage which was OK was now too big. We had to pay a 45 EUR extra-fee like more of the half of the passengers. It is clear that the size of accepted luggage was deliberately chose to make people pay the extra-fee. Moreover staff was scornful treating us with disdain. First trip with them probably the last one.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flight 3092 on 27 January 2014 from Dortmund to Bucharest. The flight was delayed but we were rushed to do the checking in and to pass through the security gate. When I asked to talk with a representative the answer was: we don't have time for that and after passing the security I had to wait one more hour until we got onboard. The checking box for the small cabin luggage - in the airport of Dortmund - doesn't have the standard size - instead of 25x32x42 it is 24x31x41. I was charged with an extra fee.

### Wizz Air customer review
I have flown 45 segments with Wizzair since its beginning from BUD to CRL FCO FRL GSE GYD LTN MAD MMX NYO SKG TKU TLV. I am very satisfied: the aircraft's are new clean and in a good condition the flights are almost always on time and the cabin crew is usually friendly. I always buy the extra legroom seat at the emergency exit row for a small fee (around 10 to 15 euros per flight) which also includes priority boarding - very good value as this seat is actually more comfortable than business class seats on most intra-European flights. Food is not included but you can buy snacks on board for a reasonable price. The only thing I would like as an extra service would be the option to pre-order hot meals.

### Wizz Air customer review
London Luton to Warsaw Chopin and Return. December 2013. Arrived 15 minutes late outbound back on time. Staff were helpful and friendly. This is a classic Low cost carrier operation and you get what you pay for - the only problem with this kind of tarmac dash boarding is if you want to make sure you sit next to each other then you need to buy priority boarding. I had read other reports prior to the flight and wasn't looking forward to it but the experience was much better than I thought it would be. I think the problems on these airlines are caused by people who don't abide by the rules and expect a full service airline product on a low cost carrier. They do have two baggage sizes for cabin baggage and they do enforce it - measure your bag before you go to the airport and accept if its not "small" you will end up paying for it. I would recommend and I would use again.

### Wizz Air customer review
My family and I travelled Turku-Gdansk on Dec 4th and Gdansk-Turku on Dec 6th. I have only positive feedback to give to Wizzair. Cheap flights (GDN-TKU only 9.99€/passenger). FA friendly and very aware of security issues. Of course you get what you pay for. On GDN-TKU we actually paid more for one piece of luggage (15) than the cost of one passenger ticket. Flight to GDN on time. GDN-TKU took place on the day winter storm Xavier hit Poland so we really didn't know what to expect. However the flight took off about 30min delayed and landed in TKU almost on time. We believe that our WizzAir flight must have been one of the few flight that managed to take off almost on time in Gdansk that day. No worries about security during take off either. Over all our WizzAir experience was better than we expected before our travel.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Warsaw return. Outward was OK. I'd read the cabin baggage conditions and taken the - minute - briefcase that fitted the size regulations. The FA's were competent. But the seats are the most uncomfortable I have experienced in 45 years of air travel. No legroom (at 1.88m I'm not that tall) but also slippery leather surfaces no back support and absolutely excruciating seat cushion. I had to keep getting up and walking up and down the aisle to relive the pain. Return was less OK. Boarding ground staff were clearly incompetent. Kept starting one thing then stopping and doing something else. Spent 15 minutes arguing with a young mother and her baby. No information on why delayed or for how long. finally loaded onto a bus and left on it for 50 minutes before finally getting to the plane. Plane was 40 minutes late; no explanation no apology. Yes it was cheap. Yes it was nasty. But on the good side we got there safely.

### Wizz Air customer review
My most recent trip with Wizz was yesterday and there were no delays and no problems and got to travel for a very low fare from Bucharest to Eindhoven. This is definitively the best airline in terms of value for money. It is truly a low cost airline with rates as low as 19 euros from Bucharest to Eindhoven. I'm a student and therefore low budget. I've been flying with them for over 3 years now and never had problems. Since Wizz started operating it definitively helped me afford more trips. Being a discount club member I always get discount and can take my friends on discounted fares as well.

### Wizz Air customer review
You may think it is a cheap flight - but they rob you blind in unseen extras. We arrived at Luton - with 2 carry on bags - 3 hour delay - which was caused by Wizz Aircraft being called to do an extra flight? So we decided to check our luggage in - so we didn't have it for hours in the departure lounge - £56 per bag. The flight makes a coach on the M25 feel luxurious! Buy this buy that. Return flight - 20 mins late. Check in via a pre desk with card machines at the ready. Did you check in on line? Yes - but it would only let 1 person check in online. Sorry - you will have to pay 30 euros per person for not checking in online. Your carry on bag is counted as large - you will have to pay 45 euros for carry on! Flight called to gate - walked miles - and then waited standing in a cold hanger to board for 40 mins!

### Wizz Air customer review
I found it impossible to check in online with Wizz Air when returning from Bulgaria. I tried on two consecutive days but with no success. I arrived at the airport without web check in and had to pay 20 euros. On my return home there was also difficulty. I have travelled with Wizz Air many times in the past and find them excellent value for money - but am wondering if web check in has purposefully been made difficult recently so as to get people to phone the very expensive help line.

Flight from Larnaca to Budapest was diverted to Vienna because of fog. Unfortunately from 11pm to after 3am no information at all. Vienna airport were not even expecting the plane to land here. Wizz customer service rep was useless kept saying be patient. Finally at 3.40 we learnt that buses will arrive at 5.30 am. Result we sit in Vienna airport all night with no food drink or information.

Luton-Ljubljana and return. Booked flights 3 days before departure at very cheap rates. I read the negative reviews and was a bit nervous but everything turned out fine. You get what you pay for. Yes there is no leg room (I'm 195cm tall) the seats aren't the greatest. We found it strange that the only way to take bags for free was if you took a small backpack so that's what we did. If you follow their rules you'll have a no hassle experience. Outbound flight was on time and return flight landed 10 minutes ahead of schedule. FA's worked hard and responded quickly when other passengers were seeking assistance. Happy to fly again at a low price and if the flight is 2 hours or less.

### Wizz Air customer review
Doncaster to Vilnius. OK it was very cheap but turned out to be very uncomfortable before we had boarded the aircraft (which did leave on time thank goodness). I have two main issues: We had booked priority boarding because we were a party of 5 with a baby of 1 year and wanted to sit together. We found that in practice this meant we could stand at the head of the boarding queue with a restless baby for about one hour. Departure gate staff made no attempt to deal with this by for example getting passengers to sit down until boarding was imminent or announcing that priority boarders could jump the queue when the gate was opened. I subsequently complained to Wizzair about this and they confirmed that priority boarding meant nothing unless present at the front of the queue at the time of boarding. It is true the flight was uneventful and extremely cheap so I have not rubbished them completely.

### Wizz Air customer review
I flew with Wizzair on 5 Nov from Craiova to London Luton the girl at check in on the ground at Craiova wanted £20.00 to let me with 800grams over the 32KG allowed. She asked me to take items so that the weight was correct which I did. My company paid for my flight and I had "priority pass" which meant boarding earlier than everybody else she refused to allow me on board until most people were boarded. I complained to Wizzair customer servvice that same evening and the response received was appalling.

### Wizz Air customer review
Donetsk- Luton. This flight will make me think twice next time I may book with this airline. Once the boarding was completed we started to see the captain and two engineers coming back and forward from the flight deck. One hour later passengers were disembarked due to a technical problem. One hour later the flight was cancelled and an airport assistant said us that Wizz had no local assistance in the airport. However she would have tried to provide assistance booking in a local room. I phoned to Wizz Air customer service the phone call is chargable and four minutes cost me £4.82. The Wizz assistant said that I had two options ask a ticket refund or wait until Wednesday (three days from the flight cancellation) for the next available flight. She said that there was no guarantee of a full hotel refund. I decided to take a train overnight and go to Kiev where more flights were available. In spite the situation Wizz Air in Kiev refused to bring me in the next flight Kiev-London available in 5 hours and asked me the full cost of Euro 200.00 which I refused to pay. The airline then replied to my refund request stating that they fall within the EU regulations for some passenger rights and under the Ukraine regulations for other things like ticket refunds. So I need to ask the refund to Wizz Ukraine which I got two weeks later. The lesson learnt is that there are hidden costs which can surface when things get wrong. The entire return travel costs me Euro 285 more than planned.

### Wizz Air customer review
I have travelled with Wizz Air a few times. I can remember only one flight which left and arrived on time. My last flight with them was a nightmare. Outbound flight one hour delayed. Return flight cancelled. Alternative offered was to re-book with them for a flight which left 3 days later. As I had to get back to work the next day I re- routed with a different airline. Wizz air refused to refund ticket. I will never use this airline again. They are not reliable and the last thing I need returning from a trip is to be stranded abroad for 3 days.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew to Bucharest - despite reading a lot of bad reviews before our trip and being a little apprehensive we had absolutely no problems. The flights left on time the staff were courteous the baggage processed quickly and without problem and the planes clean even if a bit cramped. The best advice is to do your homework and thoroughly read all the explanations on their website regarding baggage sizes etc. so you know what to expect from a low-cost airline. Would definitely fly with them again.

### Wizz Air customer review
Just got back from a few days in Prague. Flew Wizzair for the first time from Luton. After all the negative comments below what a surprise. No problems getting on/off the planes with unreserved seats. Both planes newish and clean. Cabin assistants did a great job especially with families politely asking singles to move in order to keep late boarding families together. Only gripe is Wizzair are inconsistent with baggage sizes. Some people being asked to pay for oversize baggage others with clearly oversize bags going through. A baguette drink and 4 bar kit-kat costs only £5 on board. Seats are a bit close but at £50 a seat fantastic value for money. Would definitely use again.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flew LTN to Targu Mures (TGM} for a 5 day trip. Both flights on time and in clean aircraft. Good crew polite and reasonably attentive. Seats rather cramped but bearable for a 2.5 hour flight. Boarding is a bit of a scrum at TGM not helped by 2 large Romanian men who seemed intent on blocking the aisle so that they could sit where they wanted. Did not use refreshment facilities. Have flown this route twice and will use Wizzair again. You need to keep checking the booking process to make sure you get what you want not what they want you to have. Baggage allowance was ok for me although I saw a man take a rucksack on board and place it in the overhead locker. The bag was bigger than my hold baggage!

### Wizz Air customer review
26th Sep 2013 London Luton to Warsaw Chopin flight W61306 and return was W61309 on 2nd Oct 2013. I had never flown with this airline before and will never fly again. The flight out was very cramped only 2hrs so put up with the discomfort however the trip back was a complete nightmare. We booked our case in and was left with just one small case and was asked to put it in the size frame - it fitted with just the handle out this was the same case that was checked on the trip out. The case had grown in the 5 days we were away. At the pay desk we stood in a line of customers involved in the same wizz scam.

### Wizz Air customer review
Budapest - Belgium - Charleroi. Normal for a low cost flight. However and this is my main complain Wizzair stated sizes for the free cabin baggage that were different (smaller) from any other airline in which I've traveled. In fact when you book your flight you have an option to add a large cabin bag for around 10€fee but and curiously here when you make your booking through Edreams you aren't given the option to add the large bag. Me and my friends had to pay out at the airport 45€each for being allowed to travel with our "universal" sizes cabin bags. Shame on you Wizzair.

### Wizz Air customer review
I have flown Wizzair many times and each time I book again only because they are generally the cheapest airline on the Luton-Warsaw route. If I could walk I would rather do that than fly with them. The seats are without a doubt the absolute worst seats of any airline I have every flown on and I have been on a few. Occasionally I have had one of their aircraft with acceptable seat pitch but they seem to be fewer these days and unless you are shorter than your average 9 year old you will find the legroom horrendously uncomfortable. It seems incredible to me that its actually legal to force people to sit with so little legroom. Cabin crew are not overly friendly and English is not well spoken generally. The safety announcements are almost impossible to understand in English if you are unfortunate enough to be taking your first ever flight with them. Saying all that I have yet to be delayed on one of their flights so can't complain about that. Just watch out for their stupid new hand baggage policy (if its larger than a postage stamp you have to buy the "large hand luggage" option - what most other airlines consider to be standard cabin luggage) and all their other fees that they try to inflict upon the unwary.

### Wizz Air customer review
Me and my wife went from Milan (Bergamo - Orio al Serio) to Prague for a week last August taking 2-way tickets with Wizzair. First problem: It is not true that you can add other baggage online once you've booked online and paid for your baggage. What they declare on their website is false. We had 1 booked suitcase going to Prague and we needed to carry 2 booked suitcases to come back. We had to pay an extra 65 Euros at the airport to add 1 booked suitcase. Second problem: going to Prague the dimensions of my cabin suitcase were ok. Coming back they did not conform to the standard anymore (2 cm. higher). Will never fly Wizzair again.

### Wizz Air customer review
This is the worst airline I have flow with after an hours delay we were allowed to board into seats that you couldn't even put your legs straight and had to sit for 2.5 hours with legs twisted and bent under the seat to try and get some sort of comfort. The delay was caused as explained by the pilot due to a hole found in the plane that needed patching up”- surely due to a technical fault would have done! The stewards after serving 1 drink and the usual duty free couldn't then be seen for any further drinks even though we were only half way through the flight. My advise to other travellers is pay a bit more and get a lot more.

### Wizz Air customer review
September 2013. Eindhoven NL - Bucharest RO. At check-in I was told to put my hand luggage (a size accepted by all airlines as hand luggage) in the luggage sizer. I fly with that luggage once a month. Of course it did not fit so they asked me to pay another 35 euros. Onboard seats are terrible service non existent. I am surprised there is no bathroom fee. If you have an alternative use another airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
We flew the first leg with EastJet (who are 1st class compared to Wizz!) As others have commented their hand luggage size is ridiculous and half the size of the standard UK one. Also as others have pointed out it would seem they are only interested in charging those with ridged suitcase style bags that would poke out of the top (I think the measurements were 40x40x40cm). I had a backpack on that was bigger than the size tester but was beckoned on through and not charged. One of the first of our party to get charged paid cash and was charged more than those paying by card etc. The staff were thoroughly miserable and who can blame them when they are forced to charge 80% of passengers who can fly out of the UK with a certain size back but not back? I don't think I have ever heard so much shouting and swearing and quite frankly I don't blame them at all. Then we got on the plane and there was no surprise to find that I couldn't even get my legs in without having my knees on the top of the seat in front. Being 6'3" I'm used to uncomfortable travelling but this was just awful.

Flight from Dusseldorf DE to Bucharest RO. July 2012. One of my first experiences with Wizz Air. Passed luggage check-in and heading to passport control when I read the flight was delayed no reason given. Waited for the next 4 hours in the airport with no explanation. People that had passed passport control were not allowed to come back to the area where food was served or toilets were available until we staged up a small protest. No explanation was given.

3rd August Luton to Kiev return Gdansk to Luton 12th August. Excellent flights all on time no issues with our luggage read the small print and made sure we were prepared. Found FA's friendly on both legs on flight to Kiev watched as FA's skilfully placed family together once airborne. As previously mentioned we did not have the interruptions that are experienced on Ryanair. Will be flying with them again. Luton airport is pleasant but the boarding areas are something else be prepared take water something to fan yourself and lots of patience Wizz Air staff in the boarding areas were fine.

### Wizz Air customer review
London Luton to Burgas Bulgaria. I had never heard of Wizz Air before my recent holiday. Last time I'll be flying with them. Staff were rude I didn't know such poor services existed. They have no concept of "please" or customer service. Blank expressions not at all friendly which you'd expect goes with the territory of air crew! Certainly all others I've come across. They made us and others pay £30 for a carry on that fitted in the small container but stuck out about 2cm at the boarding gate when others who also had small baggage allowance were not singled out. Their small baggage size is deliberately intended to catch out people who use standard suitcases for carry on. Wizz Air actually stated that their size is different to all other airlines.

### Wizz Air customer review
Kutaisi - Kharkiv on July 22th 2013. I have flown this airline various times due to ease of connections in Eastern European area. I have found their staff rude in the past but on this leg ground personal was very rude and instructed me to proof that I had purchased a ticket (they could not find me in their system) and simply sent me to an office where nobody was present. Luckily I had the reservation number with me and they admitted me to their flight without any apology for their mistake. to the contrary I got scolded by the check-in supervisor for complaining about their service. The fact that I had bought a ticket did not automatically guarantee me to get on the flight according to her. Apart from that their seats are cramped and especially ground personal lacks professionalism and customer service (uninterested impression and lack of courtesy) on all the legs I took in the past. I definitely will avoid this airline from now on.

Have flown 4 times to Cluj or Targu Mures from Luton in the last two years. All flights were on time and checking in was fine. The seats are a bit tight I am 5'11 but I have known worse. The cabin staff have always been fine if a little perfunctory. On all our flights the service was basic but reasonably efficient and cheap. Would definitely use again.

### Wizz Air customer review
They refused to check us in and made us buy tickets for a new flight all because it was so crowded that their staff couldn't cope with the check in! We arrived in Luton with plenty of time to check in but we ended up standing in the queue for about an hour. 10 check in desks were open and all 10 were checking in the same 5 destinations all leaving at the same time. Departure hall was in chaos. Lines were not moving and there were hundreds of passengers there. Ground staff would call out a destination name and everyone would push and shove and shift forward. A staff member led us to a check in desk where she promptly turned her back on us and we stood in the queue for another 10-15 minutes. Then told that the Skopje flight closed '8 minutes ago'. Customer services made us buy new tickets and were completely unsympathetic. They really need to sort out their check in processes. Otherwise the cabin staff were fine. Will not be flying again.

Eindhoven to Budapest and back. Planes fairly new and flight itself once airborne uneventful on both legs. That is about the only positives. return leg delayed by 1 hour. Seats do not recline. Ground and inflight staff almost universally not the friendliest. For some reason they tend to shout orders rather than talk to people. Very curious cabin luggage policy. Arrival to Budapest at a remote station and long walk to terminal. On departure same walk to a pre-industrial hangar with zero amenities were you just stand and wait in line until they open the doors for the walk to the plane. Food and beverages for purchase but did not try. All in all not impressed.

### Wizz Air customer review
Travelled relatively pain free from Luton to Budapest no extra charges. On returning we were about to board when we were summoned by a very rude member of ground staff who informed us that our carry on cases were 2cm too tall. Despite the fact that they fitted perfectly into the case measuring contraption and despite the fact that we'd flown out with them no trouble she insisted that we pay 40 euro per case to take them home. We asked to speak to someone in authority and she wouldn't let us. She knew our hands were tied and there was little we could do. There was no apology no explanation no manners.

LTN-OTP / TSR-LTN. LTN-OTP on new A320. However Wizz Air urgently needs to restructure their boarding system at Luton people were pushing and shoving and there was a lot of confusion and mis-communication as to where we were supposed to line up. I think Wizz Air would benefit from establishing a seat allocated boarding system like Easyjet as this would put an end to the 'free for all' pushing and shoving issue. If you travel through Luton there are delays to almost every flight there are far too many Wizz Air flights leaving and arriving at the same time and as such this airport cannot cope with the huge surge in early morning traffic. Cabin crew were helpful as always. As usual there is now very little seat pitch on their latest A320's so you might want to consider paying for an extra leg room seat as there is virtually no room for your legs. TSR-LTN: Flew back to Luton on a new A320 as on outboard flight. The way boarding was handled in Timisoara was noticeably better than we experienced in Luton. Departure was on time and like before the crew were excellent. All in all Wizz Air is a good low cost airline much better than the likes of Ryanair and we will definitely continue to fly with them on our future trips to Romania. It's a real shame that they have chosen London Luton Airport as their main UK base I seriously hope that they will consider flying from Stansted Airport in future.

BUD-VAR-BUD. Ground staff at Budapest were quite ignorant or downright rude but if everything checked out with You You could pass them without a word. I have to say that the new cabin luggage policy is only a way to get more money out of the passengers. Once we got onto the plane it was alright. BUD-VAR was on time the aircraft was clean and fairly new. The prices for onboard services were reasonable and I enjoyed the flight. On the way back there was a 25 minute delay and the aircraft was older with less legroom but still a nice flight. When looking for a good price for a flight always count with the larger bag and add this service when comparing prices. I would and will fly Wizzair again.

### Wizz Air customer review
London (Luton) to Budapest on July 3rd 2013. We were delayed for 12 hrs in London - basically waiting at the gate. No one from Wizz was there to say sorry or even offer a free bottle of water. Eventually people from the sub contractors turned up who refused to take any ownership for the delay. The airline knew there was a problem with the plane but simply lied about it at check in presumably to avoid any requirement to give us anything in the way of compensation. On the plane the captain made a nice speech apologising for our treatment but this did not extend to giving us so much as a free drink. Bottom line is that Wizz seems to do everything so cheaply that there is no- one to help if anything goes wrong with your flight. I would try and avoid Wizz in the future. Really not worth it unless absolutely unavoidable.

### Wizz Air customer review
HHN-TGM and return June. Our first trip with Wizz Air and probably not our last. Flights were on time in both directions and were promptly boarded with the minimum of fuss. We found the baggage allowances adequate and staff were not checking other than a few people who were obviously over the limit. We had paid for priority boarding which worked very well and extra legroom although the standard legroom looked perfectly adequate. If I was travelling alone I probably wouldn't bother with either. The cabin crew were efficient and courteous. There was no hard sell as with Ryanair and some of the other low cost carriers - for that reason alone I would fly with them again.

### Wizz Air customer review
CRL-OTP and OTP-CRL. Very good for a low cost decent even in terms of legacy carrier standards. Their hold luggage policy is very generous - the limit is 32kg of hold luggage which is more than any other LCC or legacy offers nowadays. Clean airplane perfectly on time gracious and very nice staff in Romania.

### Wizz Air customer review
W6 8002 London Luton - Vilnius 24 May. Return W6 8001 Vilnius - London Luton 28 May 2013. I flew Wizz Air for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The crew were friendly and the plane was very clean. All in all I had a pleasant and safe flight - the only thing I would suggest is that they allocate seats to avoid the scrum. Would use them again.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-BUD. Worst experience with any airline 7 hours delay with no explanation all they did was give us 2 food vouchers totalling 12 euros. We were only going for a weekend break and it was 4am Saturday morning by the time we got to our Hotel. Seats were cramped and uncomfortable and judging by the other comments here watch out for their luggage size scam.

### Wizz Air customer review
After waiting at the departure gate at Prague airport for nearly 2 hours for a scheduled flight that had been delayed we were given free meal tickets and told to return when called. However the call never came. We returned to the gate which had been closed and with a number of other disgruntled customers we were told by Prague airport staff that the airline had cancelled the flight all Wizz Air representatives had gone and we would have to arrange our own way home. We were able to book a flight home with BA and the airport were able to find all customers free accommodation. I am grateful to Prague airport staff for their help but Wizz airlines were abysmal.

### Wizz Air customer review
My wife is currently at Budapest airport with an unexplained 3.5 hr delay. They do not have not enough planes to cope with even the slightest problem and their staff all go missing when angry punters are looking for them for explanations. When it comes to checking if your cabin bag is too big to take for free they have lots of staff. When it works it's ok but they are greedy and customer service stinks.

### Wizz Air customer review
My wife and I flew from Budapest to Frankfurt. Plane was on time. Everything else was poor. The flight cost was not the cheapest being about 130 for both and having them charge you for every additional item. We were confused about the carry on requirement and our one bag was too large good on any other airline but a 30 expense on this airline in addition to the earlier cost. They provide nothing in the 2 hr flight without you having to pay no water no peanuts nothing unless you pay. The seating was the most cramped we have ever experienced with some spacious seats in the middle and you guessed it you have to pay extra on the spot for those seats also. Overall a regrettable experience.

### Wizz Air customer review
I flew from Warsaw to Budapest and back. The ticket was cheap less than 20 EUR for both ways. The attendants were friendly and the flight was on time. Altogether good quality for a reasonable price I felt no difference in quality compared to many legacy carriers.

### Wizz Air customer review
Waited all day in departure airport with 'Delayed' message showing and no explanation. Then 'Cancelled'' appeared at 6pm and still no one from Wizz Air to explain. Eventually asked to pick up luggage and queue up at Menzies desk. After 1 hour queuing we were told by them to use our own phones to rebook if we wanted to get on next day's flight as their computer was 'down' No one there from Wizz Air to organise or apologise.

### Wizz Air customer review
Regular on MXP-BUD-MXP route. All the journey apart from one leg were on time. The aircraft's are quite new and clean. If you're lucky you can get the plane with slim seats: it will entitle you to a decent legroom otherwise with the old ones is simply inhuman. In my opinion that's the only bad point of this airline. The rules about hand luggage are not easy but once familiar is possibly to cope with. The ground staff in this respect in MXP are very tolerant while in BUD are strict and rude. If booked in advance the fares are really good and the overall service is acceptable and better than Ryanair's. Let's say if you go for a low-cost is impossible to expect a high-class level and Wizzair falls under this scheme.

### Wizz Air customer review
Oslo (Torp) - Vilnius - Oslo (Torp). Wizz is a typical low cost. You get what you pay for and nothing else. We chose to pay extra for XXL seat - and had lots of space. Crew was nice enough - but their English was a bit below standard.

### Wizz Air customer review
EIN-BUD-EIN trip. Good steady flights which were on time only the flight to Budapest was slightly delayed because of military traffic inbound for Eindhoven. Cabin crew was good legroom was sufficient for 2 hours but for longer flights to cramped. We choose Wizzair because of it's good price and for the money was worth it.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Gdansk. I'm 6'4'' and found that I couldn't fit in the seat as they are spaced too close together. I brought this to the cabin crew attention and paid £10 x 2 for my Girlfriend and I to move seats. On return trip I was stopped at gate by staff as my bag (cabin approved) was oversize and would have to pay £30. I explained that I had just flown out 2 days previous and had no problem with my bag size. She was rude unapologetic and robotic in her manner. After paying she handed me my receipt without so much as a thank you or sorry for any inconvenience. I sat twisted in the cramped seat with my right leg out onto the walkway. There was no way I was giving them another penny for extra leg room and to top it off the announcement at the start of the flight stated that 'our passengers comfort is our priority during this flight'. Definitely not value for money with all extras added.

### Wizz Air customer review
Our first flight with Wizzair from Skopje to Memmingen and all was correct there was no delay. Food was just for sale but for a normal Price. Flight staff were very friendly. We can recommend.

### Wizz Air customer review
BEG-BSL-BEG. At first I thought the booking is somewhat odd with all the different fees but once you get the hang of it it's ok. The plane was 1 hour late outbound due to very cold weather and de-icing. I didn't really mind at the price we paid we were ready to wait. The flight back was smooth. All in all except the seat comfort I like Wizz.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-BUD-LTN. Booking and web-check in were very simple adding options such as extra legroom were easy to do the plane looks heavily used but clean and we were early approaching Budapest and only late into Luton because of snow of which the pilot forewarned us about. Inflight service was friendly and helpful at both airports you have to jump through more hoops than a normal carrier but pay the correct fees and you'll get an easy and trouble free flight. I'd recommend the extra legroom seats (which means automatic priority boarding) which are held by a stewardess until take off.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-PRG-LTN return January 2013. Plane clean and tidy. Legroom very tight and I'm only 5'9" - my legs touched the seat in front so must be hell for anyone taller than me. Outward flight landed early. Experience similar to other low-cost airlines. Agree with others that hand-luggage policy is draconian. Website charged us twice for bags during check-in and it is likely to take a long time to get the money back. Staff at Luton refused to help. On-board staff OK but I'd avoid buying the Romanian wine on offer if I were you - pretty vile. Return flight fine but delayed because of weather at Luton. Not their fault and the captain provided good updates. Mixed experience overall but I'd avoid in future as they aren't actually that cheap when you've totted up the overall cost.

### Wizz Air customer review
Beauvais - Gdansk - Beauvais. Airport is far from Paris and difficult to get to. Very strange requirement for visa check for non-EU nationals (you have to present yourself to the check-in desk). Outbound flight was an hour late with no excuse from staff inbound flight 15 minutes late. Staff are generally rude and unfriendly. Would avoid in the future.

### Wizz Air customer review
Impeccably clean plane. Left Prague early and arrived 25 minutes early in Luton. Crew efficient but seat pitch / leg room horrendous for someone who is over six feet and luggage policy is draconian. However excellent value for money but why can't they allocate seats to avoid the boarding scrum.

### Wizz Air customer review
Warsaw-Liverpool. A decent enough plane flight took off on time and service was brisk and efficient. My only gripe was the seating which is totally inadequate for people over six foot fortunately this was a short flight. I will pay for extra legroom next time!

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton to Budapest. On the way out all was fine apart from the smallest legroom I have ever encountered on a plane. However on the return leg things were different. All seemed to be going very well they started checking us in an hour before the departure time and we went down to the busses for boarding (or so we thought). However we were crammed into the bendy bus. We were crammed in like sardines with small children and parents all mixed in. It was dark and cold outside and they kept us cooped up in there for over 30 mins. Away we went without a hint of explanation let alone an apology. I can only assume the way Wizzair have got round their debacle with the airport is to use their busses as waiting areas prior to boarding. It was a shame really because the other parts of the flight were perfectly acceptable and the cabin crew fine.

### Wizz Air customer review
LPL-VNO. Boarding was similar to Ryanair's and on time. Aircraft clean and seemed to be very new however the seats were very thin and I could feel the tray table behind me (bit uncomfortable and irritating to be honest). Staff very professional but spoke to me first in Lithuanian on both legs this did annoy a few English speaking passengers. Menu prices very reasonable regular flight deck announcements and no pre recorded announcements everything done by the crew except the audio safety demonstration. Again I had great difficulty understanding the English. Was worried about the small bag allowance but didn't have a problem with my bag with the larger dimensions however I was checked at Liverpool and it did fit when squashed into the stand. Both flights on time fare reasonable and aircraft immaculate what more could you want from a flight?

### Wizz Air customer review
Sometimes cheaper than other options but do take care by the time you've added the extras they might not be. My flight to Barcelona was delayed 4 hours due to a fault with the plane. By the time we arrived public transport had ended and we were stuck with either a hotel bill or hefty taxi bill. All they offered was 30€ in vouchers towards another Wizz Air flight but you can imagine I'm not too keen on taking the risk of being dumped again! Saving probably isn't worth the hassle.

### Wizz Air customer review
Larnaca to Budapest. Our cabin bags were checked by WizzAir staff on checkin as well as check in bags. They confirmed our cabin bags were suitable weight and size. When we're about to board they told us they weren't suitable and had to pay 60 Euro cash or we couldn't board. Emailed WizzAir to complain and they take an unacceptable amount of time to respond. By packing so many people into the plane the legroom is uncomfortable and there isn't enough space for each persons cabin luggage to go into the overhead compartment. Works out 5 bags for each 9 seats. A cheap flight ends up being expensive when you add in the bags for checkin and the payment charges as well as the booking charges. Save your money and go a proper airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
Beauvais to Warsaw Modlin and 20 min before landing we were re-routed to Gdansk. The fog was not their fault. However upon arrival there was no one to give any information. Finally they announced they were going to bus everyone to Warsaw giving no option to anyone. I was with a disabled person who could not take the bus. The plane flew back empty to Warsaw the day. I had to reschedule my flight and was charged 150 euros for a 14-min call and pay full fare for return flight. Never fly with this company. Beware.

### Wizz Air customer review
VNO - LPL. Waited 45 minutes with 150 other people at the bottom of a flight of stairs after boarding isn't something myself or other passengers enjoy luckily I managed to sneak in front of a few passengers upon actually boarding the A320 itself. Onboard absolutely no complaints friendly cabin crew and a smooth flight. Would use again if going to VNO.

### Wizz Air customer review
Gdansk - Turku. I recognise all the comments here about the rigid enforcement of the baggage rules but at the end of the day this is the flipside to cheap fares. Its getting worse now with fees for cabin baggage Wizz are apparently the first European airline to do this. For this one hour flight I really couldn't fault Wizz Air the seats were a lot more comfortable than Ryanair. It was just a regular low cost flight as far as I am concerned. My one gripe is that the online check in on their website is very confusing and the boarding pass looked rather unclear. It doesn't give you a great deal of confidence in the airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
I travelled from Bourgas/Luton 2 weeks ago on what seemed like a new plane. It was the most uncomfortable ride I have had on a plane. The seats did not recline and you were sat upright all the time. The leg room has been cut down they have done away with then recess to put your bits and pieces in and the food tray has no dip for a drink consequently drinks are sliding about all the time and you are forced to hold it in your hand. The seats were not made of fabric but some kind of leatherette material and were hard. All this I presume is to get a few more seats in and make more money.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton to Budapest. Aware of the draconian application of the carry on dimensions I measured mine and it complied. Boarding was announced only to be followed by ground agents walking the line and selecting many to fit their bags into the 'box'. I made it with a firm boot but was disgusted to witness an elderly lady failing by a minimum margin. We all helped with plastic bags and someone found a bin liner. Result - lady lost her bag but the PR for Wizz was appalling. Note that they have now changed their baggage policy which is full of anomalies with different dimensions apparently qualifying as 'free' as well as a myriad of complications. Be warned- this is a money making scam. Good news is that I have booked another flight to Budapest with easyjet and it was cheaper!

### Wizz Air customer review
VNO to LTN. The flight departed 6:10am in the cabin there several misbehaving passengers. Despite the warnings from flight attendants several men were getting drunk during the flight. They brought their own drinks onto the plane and were loud and disturbing. They verbally abused flight attendants. Sad thing is that the crew did not take it seriously and did not take it further to police in LTN. I understand that such actions would have caused delays for the airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
We fly often with Wizzair and this is purely and simply on the grounds of cost - it is the cheapest currently available. As an airline it has a truly dreadful attitude to its customers and deserves to go bust which it no doubt will in due course. A couple of examples: 1. Wizzair has routinely texted passengers warning them to arrive "at least three hours" before their flight "due to congestion" at the airport in question. This has always been untrue and merely a ruse for the company's convenience. My wife and children unwise to the deception arrived three hours before an early morning flight from Warsaw to Luton in early January and found the airport was not even open and they had to sit outside in the freezing temperature for two hours. 2. The hand luggage rule is being applied in a manner which can only be described as inhuman. On a recent flight from Warsaw-Modlin to Luton many passengers were forced to leave whole cases behind rather than pay the draconian penalty fee for being few centimetres oversized. The Wizzair staff were curt and rude and entirely indifferent to their plight. As soon as a cheap alternative becomes available we will leave this nasty little airline alone.

VNO - SVG. Very cheap fare. New and clean aircraft. Friendly and efficient staff. Onboard advertisement a bit bothersome but fair enough the fare considered. Arrived 20min ahead of schedule. Will definitely fly Wizz Air again.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-CLJ (and back). Now I read a lot of reviews on Wizz Air and was very reluctant to travel. However having travelled to Cluj and back this weekend with them I have to say I was wrong to doubt. For everyone who complains about the luggage charges can I suggest they read the conditions carefully. They are very clear about the size of luggage. I booked priority boarding and extra leg room. Boarded fine got the seats plenty of room. Plane pushed back on both trips dead on time and left without a hitch. Ok the cabins are low cost and no frills - don't expect more but the staff I found to be smart highly presentable professional and assertive with customers who tried to pull a fast one with the seating. I cannot complain at all. I'd fly with them again.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton to Warsaw Modlin. £29 for my ticket including taxes on time departure but the usual departure scrum and panic to board. Surprisingly easy to get from Modlin airport to Warsaw centre by taxi even at an extra 130 zloty on the flight price (£25). A decent low cost service.

### Wizz Air customer review
I had two passable trips with them in the past but they are getting worse and worse. Now you have to pay a charge for payment itself - be it credit card or bank transfer or payment at their own airport office. The cabin luggage dimensions are treated extremely strictly - 3 cm more depth at the bottom of my trolley suitcase was the reason for forcing me to check it in. But what really crossed my red line was the minimum distance between the seats on the flight from Glasgow Prestwick to Warsaw - taller people had no room for their legs only the really slim ones could open their tables in full and any movement out of/back onto the seat was a fight. Considering that with the charge for check-in luggage and all other fees the tickets bought two months before the flight were EUR 180 pp I really don't see the sense of using such a carrier in future.

### Wizz Air customer review
On today's flight from London Luton to Budapest (the same carry on that was fine from Budapest to Luton) which is always used for travelling seems like because the plane wasn't full got charged 52 Pound each so for two people it coasted 104 Pound. Not the way to make up many for the empty seats better service and even treatment helps.

### Wizz Air customer review
I was lucky it was on time but I've heard horrible stories. Flew to Riga be careful about boarding at Luton they make you pay for any hand luggage even though mine seems to fit for Easyjet and Ryanair. I would not fly them again they charged me in total 90 pounds extra. Just spend some extra pounds on a proper airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flights to and from GDN on time aircraft reasonably clean. Typical LCC with à la carte service. One has to be careful when booking required extras then check-in and baggage procedures are absolutely hassle free. Legroom for me (I'm 1.95m) non existent but I knew what to expect and it was bearable on a 1.5hr flight. The only negative aspect: The on-board announcements of the flight crew were utterly incomprehensible. Even knowing the phraseology and having no problems understanding English I hardly understood more than a couple of words. All in all not the most pleasant in-flight experience but well worth the money.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-TSR-LTN. Both flights on brand new airbus A320 aircraft. Boarding was quick and efficient on the departing and return flight and cabin crew both ways were helpful and attentive. I found their seating reasonably comfortable far better than Ryanair's but the thing that really lets Wizz Air down is the incredibly tight leg room slots which are actually tighter than Ryanair's. All in all the experience was very good and efficient both flights departed on time and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. I will definitely continue to fly Wizz Air for their good service reliability and cheap pricing.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton to Katowice return. We had no problems and flights were on time. I booked priority and in both cases it actually meant something and our boarding was smooth and unrushed. Beware that some staff are extremely picky about the size of hand luggage. Mine including wheels was measured carefully before I left home and was well within the dimensions on the website. Yet it didn't fit inside their measuring gauge at the airport. I was lucky and got away with it but others didn't.

### Wizz Air customer review
London- Cluj. Flight cheaper than any other flight by quite a significant amount on time direct and baggage was quickly distributed onto reclaim after. Food was much cheaper than other so called budget airlines and magazine much more interesting.

### Wizz Air customer review
Beware the hand luggage "container" is smaller than Ryanair and EasyJet. Totally inflexible with regards to changing flights. Legroom has to be worst in it's class. Cabin staff rude. Will never fly with them again.

### Wizz Air customer review
Check-in at Budapest airport takes forever even with a printed boarding pass. You must check in with only the agent handling your particular flight. Agents are not helpful were not sympathetic to the fact that we waited 30 minutes and then discovered we were in the wrong line. This is a very inefficient system and not customer friendly. Once we got on the plane everything was fine.

LTN - BRQ round trip. Website was a bit clunky as was web check in but got there in the end. Outward flight departed and arrived on time. Web check in down on the return but got a text saying I could check in at airport with no charge. No problems there. Return flight departed early and arrived 20 minutes early which was a bonus. Flights full not much leg room cabin crew friendly excellent value for money. No problems using them again if you accept they are what they are.

### Wizz Air customer review
Turku-Gdansk with the return leg being delayed 9.5 hours. Initial delay was for 5 hours and then we came back to check it was told it would be still hours longer. Flight left at 01.10 in the end. Only 4 euro coupons were available but only on request. From three separate Wizz air flights leaving Gdansk in the afternoon and evening 3 were delayed from anything over 5 hours.

LTN to Tg Mures and return over 7 day period. Good cabin crew on both trips service slick clean aircraft seating a bit tight especially with a teenager in seat in front fidgeting all the time. No problems boarding or disembarking good baggage allowance. Overall a good experience and ahead of some low cost carriers.

### Wizz Air customer review
London Luton - Belgrade return. The airline kept changing the days of travel (not just the times) 'for commercial reasons' which was very inconvenient and cost me lots of extra money in terms of hotel and other related travel expenses which I can't get back. My advice would be to steer well clear. A nightmare of a company - you don't know whether you're going to get where you've booked with them (or get back).

### Wizz Air customer review
The website was down for two days and I was unable to print my boarding card myself as planned. Upon arrival at the airport I was told that I should have called the customer services number at 1GBP per minute to ask why is the website not working. Then I had to pay extra for airport check in and by the time it was 30 mins left before the flight and I got refused boarding. No refunds given nothing! The worst customer service ever.

### Wizz Air customer review
I travel regularly between Luton and Kiev. Since transferring destination airports from Borispol to Zhulyany the trip has been made so much more convenient and cheaper to get from airport to the centre of town. WizzAir has a long way to go in terms of customer satisfaction - it has appalling customer support it hides costs on its web site the aircrew seem to have to undergo a humour bypass to get their jobs. They cannot always speak sufficiently good English to give an effective safety demonstration when on-board they are very rigid regarding printing boarding passes and in Luton at least appear paranoid about the size and weight of hand luggage (the Kiev end was far better). All in all it is not a pleasant stress-free experience travelling with them but will I use them again? Yes until the new international terminal at Zhulyany airport gets spoiled by too many passengers or another better airline starts flying into Zhulyany. Then I might be able to avoid travelling from Luton which I dislike intensely.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-BRQ return. I am very happy with Wizz Air. Flew many times with them to and from Brno. Crew always smiling and happy. One flight was cancelled due to Fog and we were offered overnight accommodation and flight first thing in the morning from Krakow. I was impressed by this service from a low cost airline.

### Wizz Air customer review
We travelled from Luton to Targu Mures in Romania. It is a must to purchase priority check-in/seating. The queue at the regular check-in counter at Luton was unbelievable for 6am on a Sunday morning. Priority check-in allows you to go to a separate queue that is much shorter. Staff were friendly and efficient. Make sure that you only have one piece of carry on luggage. My wife and I both had a carry on bag and smaller hand bag each. We had to stuff the smaller into the larger. You must ensure that your carry on bag fits within the specified dimensions. We witnessed one poor fellow whose carry on case was within the specified dimensions except for the small wheels. He was made to pay the 50 Euro excess. Boarding was speedy - the aircraft appeared to be brand new - the inflight service ok - the flight was smooth and the exit in Romania was uneventful. Overall recommended but watch for the traps.

### Wizz Air customer review
With Internet check-in baggage drop was fast and easy. Boarding pass given. Departure was about on time. FA all unsmiling. One guy's occupation seem to be wholly to prevent people from sitting on the exit row - 10 euros more if you want to sit here. Flight announcement in English was in a rapid staccato tone which delivered little information. If I didn't know better I'd think that knocking on the metal part of the seat causes the life-jacket to pop out.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-BUD-LTN. I was very unfortunate to try and travel with this airline for a one-night family visit to Hungary. Flight delayed almost 7 hours. 3 completely different types of information given by arrogant ground crew misleading passengers. Refusing to take any responsibility and giving an 8 pound voucher Wizzair has declared the situation solved. An additional issue was a drunk passenger admittedly not the airline's fault who had to be taken off the plane adding another 45 min to the delay. I was 'lucky' just to travel to BUD but many people with small children wanted to travel onwards but with no option at 00.30 am. Wizzair did not have any solution ready for these passengers.

Charleroi (Brussels-South) to Belgrade - one way. I got a very low priced from the somewhat inconvenient airport just north of Charleroi which I booked a little less than 2 weeks before. The order in which passengers boarded was a bit confusing and the person ahead of me had a bag that was too big - he wasn't asked about it or charged. The seat was tight and there was no regular pouch in the back of the seat in front of me to put things in. Fortunately there was no one sitting in the 2 seats beside me so I still had plenty of room. The flight itself was on time with a professional and friendly multilingual crew. All in all a positive experience.

### Wizz Air customer review
I fly LTN-Riga on a very regular basis and always use Wizz Air. Never had any punctuality problems airline staff always polite and friendly and planes are modern and clean. Website is clear and easy to navigate although communication possibilities could be improved - I looked for somewhere to submit a compliment and could not find anywhere suitable. Only complaints are that the range of sandwiches could be improved and for regular fliers would be helpful if the passenger information could be retained within the system and not have to be re-entered each time.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-WAW-LTW. I am only 1.81m and I am struggling to get in the seat. One could argue that you get what you pay for but this was not even a cheap flight since it was around Easter. I would rank Ryanair and Easyjet to be higher in the comfort section. For the rest it was okay staff seem friendly although I was annoyed that £5 equals to €5. The worst was that twice we had to wait over 30 mins for our luggage after landing.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-BUD-LTN. Poor website difficult to navigate and misleading headline pricing which is subject to numerous add-ons. Online check-in process and printing of boarding pass confusing. Outward flight on time on brand new A320 return delayed for 3 hours no information or explanation given. Typical LCC experience although easyjet seem to get it right more often than not why can't others follow their example?

### Wizz Air customer review
Very little leg room. Unable to check-in online as a result we were forced to check-in at the airport for which they charged us 14 EUR each. I understand why they charge this but 14EUR is a bit high. Carry-on limit is very small and applied inconsistently. Common-sense is ignored.

### Wizz Air customer review
BCN-SOF-BCN. Having flown a couple of times from Sofia service is good for the price you pay and the relatively long trip (approx 3 hours). Flights were delayed because of the snow but at least we were taken to the final destination. Cabin crew polite and managed to smile.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Prague return. Planes were in very good condition and inflight service prices were in line with what you pay in an airport terminal rather than being extortionate. We'd booked the priority boarding option and this was worth it to ensure seats within the first 4 rows of the door. If prices were right I'd definitely consider for future flights.

### Wizz Air customer review
In the past I have been very nervous of flying 'budget' airlines. Just come back from Prague flight out slightly delayed but bearing in mind there was snow and fog forecast that was not surprising. Air crew smart polite and friendly. The plane was clean and well maintained. If I had to make one criticism on our returned flight the chief Stewardess was not English and was extremely difficult to understand her.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Gdansk. We are regular passengers 3-4 times annually. Aircraft's are good and generally punctual: Luton check-in staff OK. New seating configuration is awful for anyone over 1.83m but the rigid backs avoid having one's neighbour's head in one's throat! Flight attendants very courteous and helpful but passengers might find things even better if they simply speak English more slowly. Very good value for selective travel arrangements.

### Wizz Air customer review
KTW-DTM-KTW. Very quiet and new looking planes enough space on both flights. On time even though we had to stay in Katowice for 20 mins because the airspace was busy. Very nice Cabin Crew both pilots spoke to us on both flights we had seats in row 2 because we had Priority Boarding- very nice if you want some extra space for legs. The tickets cost us about 85€ for 2 people return with priority and 2 pieces of luggage.

LDN Luton to CZK Praha. No problems at all. There were no long waits or hand luggage assessment and the plane and flight were both clean and smooth. Excellent service from cabin staff I would not hesitate to fly them again.

I fly every weekend LUT-BUD-LUT. Flights are pretty much on time now a few years ago they suffered a lot of problems. The crew are polite and helpful and the cabins clean but basic. All in all a very good no-frills service.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Belgrade. It's like a game know the rules in advance. Check to see everything your going to be charged for before you pay. Always pay the £4 each way fee for extra leg room unless you are under 5 foot 4 tall it's so worth it. The hold baggage allowance is generous at 32kg but you pay for it but hand luggage is free and therefore closely watched so don't get greedy with either the size of the bag or weight (it's 10kg max). The planes are new cabin crew are polite but obviously trained to try and sell as much as they can during the flight. Ground staff were okay and overall had a pleasant trip. Only downside is Luton Airport I was embarrassed. I will pay the £3 in future to go through the priority security check I queued for 20 minutes last time not a school holiday and it was 7am! Disgraceful.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Warsaw-Luton. Cabin crew friendly and efficient plane clean and new. Seat pitch is awful and very cramped. Fortunately the seats don't recline but tall/large people should consider paying for extra legroom seats. You need to stick to the rules - check in online print passes hand baggage only etc. if you want the best deal. But I liked Wizzair and would fly with them again. Good quality for the price and much better than Ryanair.

### Wizz Air customer review
The booking process is very cumbersome and the hidden fees are a rip off. £5 for each leg of the journey plus a further fee for each person so a simple return journey attracts three booking fees. A scam. And then when you try to print the boarding passes the website is very clumsy and pointlessly pedantic and often doesn't work at all. If the website will not work but I arrive at the airport without a boarding pass I suppose there will be more trouble. This is not a low price airline just low quality. However I do applaud the non-reclining seats in this tight spacing. At least I do not have some selfish person reclining their seat in my face.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-PRG. Despite other comments found getting through Luton very easy for this evening flight. No delays and boarded with free seating towards the end. Was asked by other passengers if I would swap several times. I was impressed by plane crew menu the price and punctuality. However the seat was the most cramped I have ever experienced and was impossible to sit comfortably in. . So despite the many positives I would not recommend wizz based on this trip.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flights both ways were on time staff at check-in and Luton Airport and onboard were polite and friendly planes were clean and tidy and for a budget airline I was impressed.

### Wizz Air customer review
Kiev Zhuliany to Simferopol. Check-in was fast however desk staff need some training of politeness. No trouble at boarding despite no allocated seat. Plane tidy and spotless. Crews were skilled and professional. Seat pitch was tight. Food and drinks were available at high prices so opted not to have breakfast onboard. Departed and arrived ahead of schedule. I appreciate their free 32 kg baggage allowance on domestic route. Seems to be the most generous in the industry for short haul flights. Overall good and consistent. And bring your own food or eat before flight.

### Wizz Air customer review
I travel frequently between London and Belgrade. They are obviously a budget airline but in my experience are the best of that bunch. I've had a few delays but no more than one would expect although they're admittedly quite bad at keeping passengers informed in such cases. I think the inflight staff are friendly with good language skills. I have on occasion heard stewardesses being a little short with drunk Englishmen on stag parties (watch out for the Friday flights!) but who can blame them for that.

### Wizz Air customer review
EIN-SOF-EIN trip for 66 Euros. Good value for money outbound departed and arrived on time inbound landed 30 minutes early. Seats are tight but aisle seats are okay. Flight crew ok and general atmosphere nice no pushy sales pitch for the inflight catering. Would recommend this airline for city trips.

### Wizz Air customer review
NAP-BUD-NAP with a group of 12 people. Departure was on time gate staff rude and unprofessional at Budapest Ferihegy airport. They find any excuse to charge you for additional hand baggage. I was charged 60 Euros for a small piece of baggage I was obliged to pay cash as they were not ready to accept credit cards. 2 hours delayed departure on the second leg and uncomfortable old fashion non reclining seats. It is not really a low cost airline - poor quality for money.

### Wizz Air customer review
BVA-POZ-BVA and POZ-BOJ-POZ inbound 20 mins ahead of schedule each time outbound on time. I have nothing to complain lack of soap in the toilet in one of the legs but it can happen anywhere. Surprisingly no hassle with hand luggage smiling helpful crew. Captain informed of the flight details in English and Polish. Would fly again if the fare is low because you simply get what you paid for.

### Wizz Air customer review
I have flown with them many times Luton-Warsaw and I have no complaints although checking in can be a nightmare at times. That aside you get what you pay for and for a 2 hr flight and for the price paid I had no problems.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton to Belgrade return. Both flights were on time and crews polite although a bit disinterested. Seating was comfortable.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Poznan return. Charged £68 for hold luggage on top of a not cheap ticket which never arrived until the evening before I returned. Contained my tools needed to work the next 2 days. Tiny legroom and crowded noisy plane. All in all a very bad experience.

### Wizz Air customer review
Staff onboard are kind and pleasant carriers are clean and comfortable. Airport staff are rude and not professional at all. There are no Wizz Air staff responsible to take info or complaints. Being a low cost company does not compromise not having any customer support or assistance at all.

### Wizz Air customer review
My flight from Bourgas in Bulgaria was due to leave at 20.20 we were delayed over 4.5 hrs and had to divert to Sofia for the crew to be changed. In Sofia all 200 of us were turfed out and put on another plane which eventually left for Luton arriving at 03.21 local time some 5.5 hrs late. At Bourgas we were given a roll but no drink by the airline and this was meant to be representative of the length of our delay.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Budapest. Punctual flight and arrived early one of the older planes so seats a little tight but ok. Return Budapest-Luton 3 hr delay due to late arrival of inbound aircraft. Seat pitch on return was the tightest I've ever experienced horribly uncomfortable.

### Wizz Air customer review
Delayed our flight from Venice to Budapest because the crew didn't turn up on time and we lost our connecting flight. We had to stay in Budapest for 2 days and ended up spending $700 for their negligence. They have hidden fees they do not tell you about until you input your credit card information. Flight attendants were rude unfriendly.

### Wizz Air customer review
My bag was designed to be carry-on however it failed their fit test along with the bags of many other angry passengers. Rude unhelpful gate attendants. Leg room is the smallest I've seen.

### Wizz Air customer review
Prague-Luton. The flight 1 week later than J Ezrati (USA) but with the same grievances. The carry-on allowance is pitiful. My bag was designed to be carry-on but failed their fit test together with the bags of many other seething passengers. Rude unhelpful gate attendants. The flight would almost certainly have been delayed due to their insistence on checking every bag had the flight been much more than two thirds full. Flight was fine but I (and several others from what I heard this morning) will not be flying Wizz again.

### Wizz Air customer review
The airline has the smallest legroom I have ever seen I am 185cms tall and I had to stretch into the aisle. Luckily I was seated in D seat and E was free. I cannot imagine how taller people manage.

### Wizz Air customer review
Prague to Luton. Flight was fine but it's amazing how many things they have found to charge people for. Cabin crew constantly trying to sell drinks food perfume simcards etc. The carryon limits are so small that it defies common sense. I saw a woman with a large purse that would easily fit in the overhead bin or the seat in front get rejected. The rude gate attendants and front desk staff seemed to find a way to get in an argument with everyone over their carryon luggage.

### Wizz Air customer review
Paris Bauvais to Timisoara. I didn't book for some luggage and when I confirmed my flight I couldn't add on their website some other things such as buying baggage only to call them at expensive number. I decided to squeeze things in my bag and not purchase any luggage for the flight. This time WizzAir at airport in Paris Beauvais put a special box before customs and each passenger has to fit its hand luggage in the box. The box is smaller than the one that can be found for Easyjet or Ryanair. The plane was clean crew doing its job. Not unpleasant and not fantastic neither.

### Wizz Air customer review
Cork-Vilnius. Boarded last purchasing extra leg room is a good offer and really a must if you are tall or large (or both). Plane was full. Nice youthful crew clean vessel and no thrills service. Good value if you book ahead of time and travel light. Overall very pleased.

### Wizz Air customer review
AAR-GDA and return in July. Nice clean and relatively new airplane. 2hrs late arriving in AAR but was only 1.5 hrs late when arriving in GDA. Reason was technical fault on the plane which we were informed about. Cheap flight and we got from A to B.

### Wizz Air customer review
Main problem is their website. I often have problems trying to check-in. The first time also had problems with website changing title from Mrs to Mr which meant I had to call the premium rate line to get it fixed (which they did without fuss). So you need to budget for an hour or two of your time plus a five minute call to a premium rate number into the total cost. Then you may find its more cost effective to pay a higher price with another airline or just pay their airport check-in fee. In short a reasonable alternative to Ryanair but Easyjet is better at twice the price (if they serve your route).

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Warsaw-Luton. I printed my boarding passes (2 pages) from the online site and did not have any bags to check-in. The planes were bright. Cabin crew friendly. Leaving the plane at Warsaw delayed because it seemed impossible to find steps that would reach to the right height of the aircraft door. Same problem on return leg. On the outward flight seat pitch was comfortable but on the return seat pitch was very cramped and uncomfortable. Luckily the plane was not full and no-one sat in the middle seat of my row but this is not ideal for a long flight. I used their minibus service from Warsaw airport to the city. As we arrived late at night and with a delay I was pleased the bus had waited. Driver friendly but drove like a maniac down long straight roads with little traffic from the airport and through a few red lights. Overall good service but would hesitate to use Wizz again because of the seat-pitch being so small.

### Wizz Air customer review
We have flown Wizz Air many times as we have property in Romania and they are great. My mother is disabled and was lifted on the plane at Luton and helped at other end at Tirgu Mures Airport. The stewards were excellent for the money it was excellent. We love the new route to Tirgu Mures as it is a central location.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Bucharest. My problem is with the Luton Wizz Air staff who were terrible. They were rude to everyone checking in that evening and then managed to lose our luggage and we realised why when we looked at our luggage receipts and they had put bags under completely different passenger names. Staff at Bucharest (not employed by Wizz) were polite and helpful but only managed to get our bags to us the evening before we flew back to Luton. Wizz air appears to have no customer services-only very expensive tel numbers with staff as useless as those at Luton.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton to Budapest. Flight supposed to be 2025 got to gate to embark and they called a 2 hour delay as problem with plane. Estimated time for flight in the end was 11.00am the next day and I doubt whether that happened. Myself and a lot of others decided not to fly and it took over an hour to get our bags back off plane. Decided to book with easyjet. I lost 1nights accommodation 1 taxi transfer and too tired to do anything as by the time I arrived in Budapest just wanted to sleep so wasted day. Airport staff at Menzies were unhelpful (police were even called as a lot or irate people). Tiny prices but pathetic service will never fly Wizz Air again.

Luton to Budapest and back. Everything went to plan seats comfortable and thought it was very good value.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flight from Bergamo Italy on 6 May was cancelled. I learnt about this when I arrived on the airport 2 hours before the flight - no sms no call no warning from Wizz. Then they made me wait on a queue for 1:30hrs to tell me that I have to wait 3 days for the next flight or just buy a ticket for tomorrow from RyanAir which will not be reimbursed. WizzAir personnel didn't know nothing and just pointed the passengers to the ticket desk. They said the reason for cancellation was airport officials were having a strike but all the other airlines were flying and there wasn't a single cancellation besides Wizz. My guess is that because the passengers for my flight were around 30 people - they decided to just cancel it. Otherwise I don't see any reasonable explanation. Exercise strong caution!

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Prague. The ticket was much cheaper than competition on this route. Most problems with this trip related to Luton Airport and not the airline. Boarding slightly delayed due to a engineering inspection but kept well informed. Food and drinks offered onboard and crew appeared polite and efficient. Bags on the belt as I left passport control.

### Wizz Air customer review
On the outbound flight to Kiev - no card machine working so payment in cash only for any drinks etc on the flight. Inbound flight from Kiev they just happened to have the same problem but Wizz Air Ukraine cannot accept Ukrainian currency on their flights so we had to go without food or drink for the whole 3 hour flight. Add to that the fact that the bags are free on Wizz Air Ukraine so didn't pay for them or book them the bags online. No problem on the way out but on the way back refused to take the bags until I paid them 692 Hrvnia. Don't use them unless you don't eat drink or need to take luggage with you.

### Wizz Air customer review
I wouldn't advise to ever buy their Wizz Air Exclusive membership - it is cheating. I was silly enough to buy it and now cannot find any flight with this "exclusive" discount. The discounts simply disappeared from the flights where they used to be a couple of weeks ago when Wizz Air was actively promoting this service.

### Wizz Air customer review
The flight from Eindhoven was late one hour. For flight from Vilnius they were very strict for luggage and service was rude. I would not recommend. Of course it is cheap but there are other cheap airlines so why bother.

### Wizz Air customer review
My two short hops (IEV-SIP-IEV) on time and trouble free. Remarkably good crews tidy planes good seats but pitch tight. I didn't buy their snacks and drinks (rip off prices!). I realize that if something goes wrong low-cost would be take it or leave it but in my case I've got a good value for money. Airport handling in Zhulyany was really low cost experience but all worked and didn't cause any problem. Fight for seats didn't look great but wasn't so bad.

### Wizz Air customer review
I have been travelling with Wizz Air twice so far and I was very satisfied. The condition of planes is excellent and it is cheap if you book at the right time.

### Wizz Air customer review
London Luton to Budapest. Seats confortable and soft although leg room is tight. Cabin crew was kind and dealt extremely well with medical emergency. Flight was slightly delayed but reached destination and my bags were on it so no complains.

### Wizz Air customer review
Basically its a no frills airline and you get what you pay for. Booking early can give great prices. They have introduced fare discounts for holders of discount cards which cost £8.50. Plus side is new aircraft and generally good cabin crew. Downside is high prices for food and drink onboard. Airport shuttle transfers are good - usually 5-6 euro. Standard 32/10kg baggage is a plus for those needing it. I noticed the comments about legroom - they will usually tell that the seats in the middle by the exit doors have been reserved - I have seen this a few times so try and board last or wait till you hear the announcement boarding complete then simply move there. I have done this twice.

### Wizz Air customer review
London Luton to Belgrade return. Nice relatively new aircraft; punctual on both flights I welcome the absence of reclining seats as these can inconvenience the person sitting behind. My only criticism is that is that it is not possible to book allocated seats. This results in a free for all at the aircraft.

### Wizz Air customer review
LTN-KBP. Wizzair's seats are very soft and wide but the legroom is extremely tight and it would be much more pleasant if the passenger in front could not recline their seat back further restricting your legroom. Other than that the cabin crew (all Polish) were smiling well groomed and acted with professionalism throughout the flight. The flight took off and landed on time with no issues at all. Wizzair have an "Extra Legroom" option available for a surcharge I think I will take advantage of this next time I am on a 3 hour flight with them. On a shorter sector I don't mind. For the price though they offer excellent value for money.

### Wizz Air customer review
Flight from Bergamo-Cluj delayed 5.5 hours because of technical issues. Was given a McDonald food voucher for snack and drink but told in the departure area that it was only accepted on a different floor before passing the security check. Checked-in online but website was so slow the connection was timing out so I had to pay 10 euros for a piece of printed paper at the airport that was trashed when I was given another boarding pass. Seats are cramped and not reclining. Unless broke get a decent carrier. The price of tickets is cheap indeed but everything else is a rip-off.

### Wizz Air customer review
Turku-Budapest return flight flight was on time drinks on the plane affordable seat is comfortable but you cannot recline crew nice with not perfect but good english bags not too late after landing. Price was good bag costs some 10-20EUR per check in other than that the flight was all together like 60EUR.

### Wizz Air customer review
I booked Katowice-Doncaster. The flight was delayed from 1940 to 0900 the following day. We were left in the departure lounge with no access to hot drinks or food during this time. A hotel was offered at 0200 but with no guarantees of when we would return to the airport and requiring us to reclaim bags etc. Information in English was almost totally impossible to find. The airline staff at the airport were mostly invisible and when present handled this totally unprofessionally. We were given a certificate by GTL Lot to prove the flight delay. I complained and received an email promising to deal with it. A month later nothing. A further email got a reply "fill in our form" - I had! The staff are obviously incompetent and poorly trained.

### Wizz Air customer review
HHN-KTW-HHN. Very low fare (30 EUR return) payment a little complicated if you want to wire (cheaper than credit card). HHN-KTW slightly delayed airplane and seat pitch acceptable for a low cost carrier buy on board affordable). KTW-HHN operating while major carriers had flights cancelled due to snow. Boarding punctual departed 1 hour late due to air traffic restrictions. Would use them again. Much better than Ryanair.

### Wizz Air customer review
My flight from London Luton to Zagreb had been cancelled twice : first time they had no fresh cabin crew and the second time because they did not have a plane for rebooked flights. There was no communication between airline and the airport staff until the very last moment of flight cancellations. If I have known after the first cancellation that the Wizz wasn't able to cope with cancellations backlog I'd not have rebooked my flight with them I'd used alternative routes. They have no consideration or care to their passengers and I have no wish to use them again or recommend them to anyone.

### Wizz Air customer review
Cramped late and surly but cheap. However God help you if you need extra luggage or need to discuss anything - offices never open phones lines are £0.75 per minute - and play music to you for the first 15 minutes. Overall not a money saver and makes you feel like cattle.

### Wizz Air customer review
We pre-booked a transfer through Wizz Air for when we flew Luton - Cluj. We waited an hour for our taxi and decided to phone to ask where it was only to be told that they had picked someone else up and no they weren't going to send anyone out to get us no they weren't going to refun the money and that in fact it was all our fault! We had to pay for another taxi to take us to our hotel which was half the cost we had already paid through Wizz Air. I tried to claim the money back from Wizz Air I have written 2 emails and 6 weeks later I am still awaiting a response. Think twice before using! !

FCO-WAW nice new A320 flight on time. Check in assistants shouting at several others - manager doing the same. It was so bad it almost seemed unreal. Meanwhile seats packed tightly together - not comfortable. Avoid flying with Wizz from this airport.

### Wizz Air customer review
Luton-Prague-Luton. Poor service rude cabin crew refused to collect rubbish. Flight Deck Crew spent more time in passenger compartment chatting up cabin staff than flight duties. Ripped seats drunken football fans not dealt with at all. Priority boarding at Prague end ignored by ground staff. Toilets dirty.

### Wizz Air customer review
Budapest to London with A320 almost 7 hrs delayed. They said due to weather conditions but it wasn't true. We were told at the check-in desk that all Wizz planes were delayed that day so they had to wait for each other no staff etc. Anyway we got some vouchers to buy some food in Ferihegy. On the plane the legroom between the seats is very tight AC ran too cold. The crew was friendly and helpful.

### Wizz Air customer review
Weeze-Bucharest Baneasa return. Great value for money including baggage etc - return flight for less then €100. Check in at Weeze unorganized due to two lines for one check in desk which caused annoyance amongst passengers. Flight uneventful onboard catering boring. Bucharest Baneasa terrible airport but Wizz Air is not to blame for that.

### Wizz Air customer review
Cluj-Weeze clean plane friendly crew. The space for legs could be better. Better and cheaper than Ryanair and BlueAir and young A320 fleet.

Luton-Warsaw return trip. This short hop was efficient and hassle free. The aircraft was clean and comfortable check-in all done online which means less time queuing at airports.

### Wizz Air customer review
BBU-NRN. Bucharest Baneasa airport is easily reachable but not a nice location to be - very limited catering facilities and long queues at security. Had to check in online the day before and baggage dropping was a breeze. Bussed to plane with a slight delay free seating A320 not the newest but okay seating is very tight and cramped with no reclining seats. Luckily the seat next to me was free although the flight was about 95% full. Cabin crew announcements in Eenglish German and Romanian - English and German announcements virtually not understandable. Baggage took only a few minutes to appear after disembarking. Overall a typical low cost experience nothing special but no hassle. Overall: You get what You pay: a 30EUR flight is not a luxury-trip.

### Wizz Air customer review
We just spent a few days in Poland and used Wizz air to get us there. All went like clockwork from booking on-line to the travel itself. The planes took off on time and all was efficient. The only criticism was that at Warsaw airport the announcements by Polish staff were not at all clear when they spoke in English so you had to keep your eye on the information board. Great price and service!

### Wizz Air customer review
Brussels-Budapest. Planes new with leather seats. Our flight delayed like many people commented here yet only for 30 min. Cabin crew were nice and helpful and their onboard menu is not expensive. Budapest airport T1 is one of the best low cost airports I have seen with free wifi and helpful staff. Good value for money better than Ryanair cheaper than EasyJet.

### Wizz Air customer review
Madrid to Katowice Kiev to Katowice Katowice to Madrid. Newish A320s on all segments. Clean aircraft comfortable seats polite and friendly service. As with other low-cost carriers with no assigned seating the gate areas get a bit push-and-shove with people elbowing to get ahead even though except for boarding in Madrid (which was a more-or-less orderly line through an airbridge) everyone's getting on a bus to be taken to the aircraft parked on the apron anyway. Noticeably better than Ryanair throughout the whole process and for me at least on these flights a notch above Easyjet.

### Wizz Air customer review
Varna - London Luton. Modern clean aircraft with adequate legroom. My complaint was that the Captain switched on the seatbelt sign shortly after take off and said that the crew were unable to commence their inflight duties as we were expecting some turbulence. After an hour of near perfect flying conditions the seatbelt sign was switched off and the crew commenced the service. It seemed obvious that the crew could just not be bothered and sat in the rear galley chatting and eating.

### Wizz Air customer review
BUD-CRL-BUD. A320's are okay especially the new additions to the fleet with a slightly different interior compared to the old ones. It is a usual no-frills airline so I do not have much to say about the FA's. The biggest problem with the airline is that its flights are almost always delayed (or at least on this route). It is usually operated towards mid - to late-afternoon which means delays have already accumulated during the day. I think you are lucky to get away with a 60-120 minute delay on my last CRL-BUD flight I was delayed for over 4 hours.

### Wizz Air customer review
BGY-SOF and BBU-BGY. Flight to Sofia delayed half an hour with no remarks shown on the monitors; plane not brand new but acceptable seat pitch and polite crew. Return from Bucharest Baneasa was on time but the boarding hall in this airport is a disgrace being overcrowded with few monitors (very hard to be read) and with no space for more than 250 persons so guess what happens when all the 4 gates are operating at the same time. Besides that it took 40 minutes to get through passport control and security checks. The plane to Bergamo was a new A320 with miserable leg room and hard leather seats. As on the onward trip all the announcements were pronounced so quickly that it was almost impossible to understand what they were talking about. Even the safety announcements were obviously made only because it is compulsory by law since they were just rushing to complete the sentences as soon as possible complying with the short time between bording and departure. When I fly with a low cost carrier I often wonder if the cabin crew would really be able to manage any kind of emergency since I do have the feeling the everything is speeded up to the very limit and this is against safety. It was my first time with this airline and I do not find them to be worse or better than the other major cheap carriers I have been on so far.

Treviso to Lviv. Seemed like a new plane. Very comfortable satisfactory legroom and very polite and friendly service.

Rome to Prague. Was very happy with the flight. Airplane clean with leather seats. The flight attendants were polite. Baggage claim was quick.

This airline is terrible! Timetable changes (moving flights to different days rather than times) after you've booked are unacceptable when people have already made non-refundable bookings for ground transportation and hotels etc). Wizzair do this with appalling regularity and with no regards for the effect on its customers.

We often fly with Wizzair to/from Charleroi/Budapest and find it quite reliable at least on these destinations. The cabin crew is usually friendly and assists with our small children. We only got a lost suitcase once around Christmas so it took longer to retrieve it but we eventually did. I don't know about other destinations but if you intend to fly between Brussels (Charleroi) and Budapest I would recommend it.

Avoid Wizzair! A group of us had our outgoing flight cancelled. We made a claim for a refund for that flight. That was 6 weeks ago and there has been no response. I have called their phoneline (which is premium rate @ 95cent per minute) several times and no one has ever answered. Those calls have cost me around 40 euros already. Terrible company

PRG-LTN and LTN-PRG were rather good flights. Minimum legroom friendly staff. Would prefer flying CSA to Heathrow any day but we flew to LTN on Friday and back on the following Tuesday bought tickets on Tuesday afternoon for 8900 Czech crowns all included (1 checkin bag) - that's less than 250GBP when buying 2 days in advance - cheaper than any other carrier.

London - Kiev. First problem started a few weeks prior to travel when the return flight was simply cancelled. No explanation offered. We had to buy (very expensive by then) BA tickets instead. Refund from Wizzair was promised but never given. Contact over an email is not possible. I called their premium phone line numbers at least 4 times to chase my refund - still no refund. Flight - delayed by 1.5 hours on the way out - people queuing up at the gate - no explanation offered. No drinks available on the flight.
