### "don't forget middle name"
Milan to Tirana. Scammed and held at ransom for new tickets. I cannot believe we have been cheated out of new tickets at the checking in desk. No middle name no boarding. We fly very often and can't remember last time middle name was required. I fully believe this is unfair to make more revenue from already paying customers. The airline was fined in 2019 by the Italian Competition Authority for this ery issue. It is impossible to get through to the complaint department (if there is one). You have to write a letter and send to Italy. Cannot call or email. Avoid if you can, or at least don't forget middle name. Wizz Air, BA better choice.

### "the sooner it goes under, the better"
Milan to Tirana. Same story as most other people on this page, 27th August we turned up at Milan Malpensa airport to fly to Tirana where we had arranged to meet up with out our elder daughter flying in from Budapest - so we could not back out of flying. At the check-in the airline agent told us me and my wife had not included our middle names - mercifully our younger daughter hasn't got a middle name - and that we had to re-purchase tickets from scratch at last minute price. In short, we had to pay an extra €638 on top of the €324.86 we had already paid through Opodo. Steer well clear of this airline, the sooner it goes under, the better!

### "forced to buy new tickets"
Milan Bergamo to Tirana. I was denied boarding and forced to buy new tickets on Blue Panorama flights, as my second name and third names were not on my ticket. This obligation wasn't clear, the airline's rules are ambiguous and Expedia.it for example, doesn't require the second name for a Blue Panorama ticket. The airline doesn't offer online check-in and changes can't be made less than 24 hours in advance. Blue Panorama's rules are profoundly different to that of other airlines and evidently do not conform to the most basic international standards. So far, the airline has refused compensation.

### "would 100% not recommend"
Not Verified |  Rome to Santorini. After lining up for over an hour to check our bags in we were told that we needed to go change my partners name on the booking as his middle name was not on it. So we had to pay an extra 50 euro to get this done even though it was not an option when we were booking the flight online. When we were at the service counter we were chatting to a family and another couple who said that had to do the same thing. This is an absolute scam and would 100% not recommend flying through this airline.

### "airline is super shady"
Mykonos to Milan Bergamo. Middle name change is a total scam. Some had to pay €300 depending on the time they have booked it, some people chose not to pay and didn’t fly, the airline is super shady and is scamming thousands of people daily.

### "in my opinion a complete scam"
We recently flew from Santorini to Rome on Blue Panorama airlines. Upon arriving at checkin we were forced to pay an additional E300 to Blue Panorama due to the fact that my wife’s middle name was not shown on the actual booking. For clarity her name appeared as it does on her passport, the booking was in their system but it merely did not have her middle name shown on the booking. I explained that her legal identity was the same as the booking and showed multiple forms of identification to no avail. I am not sure how this could be the case but we were nevertheless forced to pay this extra amount of E300. We witnessed other passengers being stung in a similar fashion and one family of four was forced to pay E1200. When I objected I was told “no pay no fly”. This is outrageous and amounts to no more than theft and is in my opinion a complete scam being operated by this airline.

### "I did not include my middle name"
I was incredibly surprised when I was denied boarding on my flight last week from Rome to Zante because I did not include my middle name on the booking. Upon finding this out, Blue Panorama's office to update the ticket with middle name claimed 'that their machines were down' (I must say, it was not a good look for their airline and their online reviews have suffered because of it - this would probably explain why their plane was at 40% capacity. I only checked the reviews after this disgusting experience). They claimed I needed to buy a new ticket. To charge the full price for a replacement ticket when my middle name was not even added to the new ticket is quite frankly appalling. The airline also made me buy me new ticket in cash! It is a complete scam and I honestly will throw a party when this airline goes under. I strongly recommend that you do not fly this airline.

### "Worst experience I’ve had"
Santorini to Rome. Worst experience I’ve had, what a money grab, was early to the airport after checking in online and my flight was delayed and then I finally was ready to board and they made me go back through security just to change my name because you have to pay to put your middle name on your ticket so I almost missed my flight and had to pay 50 euros to “change my name”. Absolutely ridiculous will never fly with blue panorama again. This is a money grab.

### "worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  Santorini to Bergamo. The worst airline experience I've ever. With tickets booked from our travel company they were not accepted and sent us to another desk in another part of the airport to pay 600 Euros to put middle names onto my girlfriend and get our boarding passes - total scam. In the end, after paying the 600eur for the "name changes" I got the boarding passes with first and last name as I had previously! Nobody could explain why we paid that value, nobody even cared if we miss or not the flight, the counter girl was almost making fun of us. Never ever again I will fly with this company.

### "middle name change scam"
Tirana to Milan. I will never use this airline again after being caught by the middle name change scam. You may have got 60 euros from us but you have lost our business forever. The flight was Tirana to Milan, had no choice but to pay as had a connecting flight in Milan.

### "a change of name fee"
Not Verified |  Milan to Tirana. Horrible experience. They scam you with a change of name fee as they don't provide middle name or additional name option on their website. The boarding process is complete chaos. The plane used in the flight was a very old 737 which a very poorly maintained interior.

### "total and utter scam"
Tirana to Genoa. Upon checkin we were made to pay 120 EUR because when we booked we hadn't entered our middle names. The charge for this was 60 EUR each! Just because they had to print us another ticket. We had no choice but to pay or we could not fly. This cost almost as much as the original flight. This is the only airline I have ever heard of doing this. It is 100% a total and utter scam and I am disgusted. So "if" you book with Blue Panorama make sure you enter your middle name. Furthermore the plane diverted after one of the most scary "almost landing's" due to wind, which is understandable, but I've never encountered such a terrifying flight experience. Just coming into land in Milano was scary despite perfect weather. I was so relieved to finally get off the plane. There was no direction to get to the bus which was then supposed to take us to Genoa. We ended up staying in Milan and paying even more for accomodation and further travel expenses. Needless to say I would not recommend flying with Blue Panorama and never will again.

### Blue Panorama Airlines customer review
Tirana to Milan. Friendly staff but aging aircraft. I had to pay 60 euros penalty because I did not enter my 2nd name when booking (which is not legal but good as I needed to go home, I do not have not had a choice). Personnel sympa mais avion vieillissant. J'ai du en plus m'acquitter de 60 euros de pénalité car je n'avais pas saisi mon 2ème prénom lors de la réservation (ce qui n'est pas légale mais bon comme j'avais besoin de rentrer chez moi, je n'ai pas eu le choix).

### "worst airline experience"
Rome to Corfu. Literally the worst airline experience I've ever had bar none. Two hours to queue for check in with one inexperienced member of staff checking in the whole flight. Then sent to another desk in another part of the airport to pay 100 Euros to put middle names onto my childrens' boarding cards - total scam - no other airline does this. So two and a half hours to get to passport control where they didn't know whether the plane had left or not so further delay. Had to then run to the gate for a plane that was leaving an hour and a half late. Literally nobody cared whether their appalling customer service and bullying tactics was going to make us miss the flight or not. The flight was the worst ever in terms of safety. Passengers still eating/drinking and trays down when landing. Very bumpy landing. This lot are going to cause a serious accident at some stage. Total cowboys. But the fun wasn't over. Luggage was lost and didn't appear in Corfu for 5 days with no communication from the airline at all to the Lost Luggage team at Corfu Airport. During this time they were impossible to contact from either our hotel or by our tour operator both of whom were shocked by the lack of care/service. It's difficult to believe how bad this lot are.

### "such low level of service"
Second experience with this airline. After being charged 50EUR last year to add my middle name on the ticket, I told myself I would never use them again. However, Blue Panorama was the only airline operating on the route I was interested in this time. Take off was scheduled at 6:30am. At 5:50am, there were still about 10 groups queuing for check-in. After checking in our luggage, we had to pay for a "fast track service" to skip the queue at security in order not to miss our flight. This would not have happened if the airline had planned correctly and opened more than one check-in desk. After passing through security, we found out that our flight was delayed. We were told that the tires of the aircraft needed to be changed. The airport staff said (stupidly repeating the information from Blue Panorama) that the plane would be flown to another airport to have the tires changed. However, the aircraft stayed on Bergamo airport's tarmac the whole morning. We didn't see any technician working on the wheels. We eventually took off at 11:30 (five hours delay). The crew did not even bother apologising for the delay. Is it a common situation for them. I am now trying to claim my compensation (250EUR per passenger). Blue Panorama does not have an online form to fill to ask for such compensation like most airlines. You need to send a registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt to their office Rome. I am a frequent flyer and have never seen such low level of service on a European airline.

### "allowed to operate?"
Milan Bergamo to Tirana. How are these robbers allowed to operate? I was charged a total of Euro 330 at check in just to insert middle names to return tickets for 3 persons. Since when is a middle name legally mandatory? What about people with many middle names? They might as well have a policy of charging for the way you walk and talk. Sure, why not? Call it company policy and happy days.

### "a pure scam"
Santorini to Milan. There was no place to enter our middle names when we booked on line yet we were not allowed to board our flight because our boarding pass did not have our middle name as per our passports. To board, we were forced to pay an extra $50 euro/pp but our boarding passes were never updated with our middle names - a pure scam. We were told that this is the only airline with this charge. They now ask for your middle name. Customer service is non-existent as they really do not want to hear from you. Do not support this airline if you have choices. It's the only way to put a stop to such unethical businesses and practices.

### "into defrauding  passengers"
Mikonos to Rome. This airline is into defrauding  passengers. I bought my ticket with Flight Network on line. When I got to the airline counter I was told that there was a difference between my name in my passport and on my e-ticket. But there wasn't! My name on my e-ticket was as in my passport. I was told that I had to pay additional 50 Euros and sign a document that I agreed with the charge to take the flight, otherwise I would not be able to get on the airplane! I have tried to get the money be refunded to me, but wasn't able to.

### "airline is running a scam"
Tirana to Milan. This airline is running a scam and forces you to pay 60 euros to add middle name or second first name to your boarding pass. I strongly advise not using their awful services. Their extorsionist practices are unbelievable. The flight itself was late, no service.

### "had to pay the 50€ penalty"
Mykonos to Rome. If your name in your travel documents does not match your reservation name exactly, you must pay 50€ each on the spot, or they will not let you board the plane. The scam is that the airline doesn't have a place for middle names on their reservation system! Someone said it was because Italians don't have middle names. As such, every American aboard the plane I asked had to pay the 50€ penalty. Also, this airline does not carry vodka on board!

### "worst experience flight"
Tirana to Bologna. The worst experience flight I ever had. First they charged €60x2 = € 120 missing middle name and the box for it wasn't available when booking. Customer service to Albania very poor, didn't have any info, and the most ridiculous thing they lost my luggage never came to Bologna (not found yet today September 2017). Called for a long time not customer service answered beside once a call center representative who didn't even know what to say. E-mailed three weeks in the row and couple answers "we are trying to track it. To all passengers who still fly with Blue Panorama, be careful and carry your luggage in the plane with you. Be careful when you book too otherwise the tickets will cost double with scam fees or if you don't have any money to pay it you will loose the flight.

### "Such a scam"
Such a scam. No field to enter middle name yet they charge you €50pp for not doing so. First name and Family name asked for. So many other reviews of this on here, TripAdvisor and Facebook so cant believe they are not aware of the issue. More likely they are milking it for profit. Pay it or lose it. Other airlines don't make booking this misleading. We won't fly them again, there are much better reasonably priced airlines in Europe.

### "basically an extortion scam"
Bergamo to Tirana. As with other users I was the victim of what is basically an extortion scam. The website at the time I booked had no place to enter middle names. But they will not let you fly without them and then charge you 80 euros to change them. The website has been fixed, but who knows what other scam this airline is dreaming up.

### "lose the flight or pay up"
Milan Bergamo to Pantelleria. The check-in lady told us that due to a new airline rule introduced on the 17th May 2017 all passenger information has to match exactly the travel documents. Rule that turned out to be a problem for my wife: her second name was not in the booking information. For the simple reasons that: there was not such rule at the time of booking. (And no such rule on many other airlines by the way).The booking form on the airline's website does not have a field for second names. Result: 50€ to pay on the spot. With no choice really: lose the flight or pay up. Called the airline the same day and pointed out all the issues. According to Blue Panorama the new policy is a tremendous improvement, allowing the valued customer to take the flight with a little bit of extortion. I learned that the booking form still has no field for the second name but the customer is expected to input any additional names in the name field after the first one, without spaces. This is priceless. Not surprisingly, I also learnt that the only way to request a reimbursement is to send an insured letter. I'm Italian so I know how this works: you spend the 6 Euros for the letter then wait for the usual many years for a "no", then get the lawyers involved.

### "do not fly with this airline"
Rome to Santorini. When we arrived at the Rome apart, we went to collect our borading passes and were informed that we had booked the flight "incorrectly" as we didn't put the middle names into the online booking. However, there was no space provided to do so and when we put First and middle names into the "Given Names" box, it simply declined our request. The lady at the desk was rude and abrupt, throwing our passports back at us informing us that we had to pay a fee because our middles names were not added. We then had to pay $50 euros each! I suggest that you do not fly with this airline, they just want money and will find anyway to get it from you. The staff are rude and do not put the needs of a customer first.

### "choose a different airline"
Rome to Thira. Be aware an additional 50euros per person is charged if you have not included your middle name on the booking. There were at least 50 people we saw for our flight alone having to change their ticket to include their middle name at a cost of 50euros. Not to mention having to queue 3 times to then check in. An appalling start to our honeymoon and clearly the website is designed to catch out as many people as possible. When we spoke to the supervisor he admitted this happens all the time! Please include your middle name / names when booking in the box that asks for first name! Or even better choose a different airline!

### "among the rudest I've ever met"
Pisa to Tirana. The airline charged me 50 Euros at the gate when I was boarding my flight from Pisa to Tirana because my middle name was not on the ticket. Even though the website only says "First Name" and "Last Name," they claimed I couldn't fly without my full name on the ticket. As such, they charged me 50 Euros to fix the problem and to board the plane. They fly the oldest planes I've ever traveled on. Their customer service agents are not friendly and do not help you. I called to complain about the fees at the gate and they said "it's the rules, sorry. Yet, there is nowhere in the travel terms and conditions that says you must enter your middle name in the first name field when booking the ticket. Their flight attendants are among the rudest I've ever met. They argued with another passenger on the flight when she asked for a drink, telling her that she should have asked early.

### "three hours delay with no assistance"
Mykonos to Rome. Three hours delay with no assistance, no crew, no screen at the gate. The call center is clueless, claiming that the plane is on time when it is in fact already delayed. Don't fly with this company, and if you do, take into account at least 90' dead every trip.

### "fly a different airline"
Rome to Tirana. Worst airline I have known. Checked in and when time to board came nothing happened. Flight got delayed by 6 hours and then 6 hours later boarding got delayed again. Everything is bad about this airline. Do yourselves a favour and fly a different airline even if it's a bit more expensive.

### "seating is uncomfortable"
Both inbound and outbound flights departed with over a 2 hour delay - outbound 3 hours of which 1 hour was on the tarmac. The planes (both) were filthy, the staff (all, bar none) were rude and unpleasant (I had asked how long it would take to refuel and the reply was "we don't know" in a tone of voice that suggested that I was out of order for asking). The food is abysmal (eat before you go or take your own). Seating is uncomfortable and airless. Inflight entertainment is practically zero. The best bit was when I was told I could not stretch my legs outside the toliet area when I went for a walk to the back to move a little and get some water. The hostess gave me the impression that I would set off the lifeboat or open the door. My understanding was simply that she wanted to make sure that the seat for the crew was free. All of the cabin crew were completely disinterested (you need to know where to get a blanket and get it yourself and if you're asleep or not looking at the right moment they won't give you anything to eat or drink). The outbound trip was so bad that we made sure to eat beforehand and rest sufficiently to be able to deal with the return trip from Havana (through Santiago de Cuba). All of this was not at a cheap price - you just get the cheap experience. Information is nil. You do not receive an email telling you that the flight is late, there is no indication online (we checked repeatedly before heading to the airport) and once at the airport, the boards tell you "estimated time" for departure only. If you're lucky you may find a ground crew member who can elaborate but don't hold your breath.

### "cabin crew friendly .. food always the same"
This was my first time with Blue Panorama. Travelled in July from Milan Malpensa Airport and after a smooth flight landed on time in La Habana, Cuba. The food was ok although the steward told me that it's always same. The cabin crew was friendly and did everything to make the flight as enjoyable as possible. The only minus was that the entertainment system didn't work. I took a flight back on 3rd August. The food was indeed the same.

### "Cabin crew friendly and professional"
MXP-HAV return in Y class. Boeing 763ER was in good condition and quite confortable. I chose for "poltronissima air" that indicates the possibility to be assigned a seat in the emergency exit row larger than others by paying 50 € at check-in desk and overall was pretty good allowing me to stretch my legs. Cabin crew friendly and professional passing around with water trolleys through all the flight. Both flights arrived at destination before the time scheduled.

### "charter flight and everything went well"
NAP-RMF round trip in August. It was a charter flight and everything went well with exception of long check-in queue before the return flight (but the Marsa Alam Airport is small). FA present during the flight meals served and eatable double drink and coffee or tea. Legroom was enough (for a charter flight) for a 3 hour trip. A stupid guy smoked in the lavatory during the outbound flight and FA upon being called reacted quickly to enforce the safety rules. Think the fleet age is not the best possible. I can't rate safety standards or maintenance quality.

### "terrible service on ground and in the air"
Flight to Cuba. This airline is simply a disaster. Terrible service both on the ground and in the air. Poor seats meal etc. It is considered as cheap airline - not just on the price but the entire service.

### "impressed by this Italian airline"
From Milan MXP to Luxor Cairo on June 11. Positively impressed by this Italian airline. Clean aircraft good seating in a 737-400 and very elegant and friendly FA. Flight on time and although it was a charter flight snacks and drinks were served.
