### “They ruined our Christmas”
They ruined our Christmas. After 7 days and over 80 messages to customer service nobody knows where our luggage is. Please avoid this company if you want to enjoy your holiday and not be on the phone every day writing messages and emails. The worst customer service ever!

### "ruined our Christmas"
TUI Airways and Gatwick airport ruined our Christmas. You pay so much money to go on holiday in Mexico over Christmas and they destroy it because still after 5 days nobody knows where our luggage is. Very incompetent people and useless customer service. Maybe they still are celebrating Christmas.

### “the service was first class”
Well, where to start! Simple straight forward, helpful staff at Gatwick. They given the passes for the lounge and fast track security. The lounge was fairly quiet and so was security mind you it was 6am on a Monday morning. Boarding was quick and once in the seat the service was first class with a team of 4 crew looking after the Premier Economy, cabin while waiting we were offered Sparkling wine or Orange Juice. Once we had reached cruising height we had the first drinks service, and our order for lunch was taken. The choices been Sausage and Mash, Thai Green Chicken Curry and rice, and a Veggie option. After lunch which was about 2hours 45 into the flight and we had another drinks service. The Cabin Service Manager then announced that should anyone want more drinks please ring the call bell. We had the duty free trolley pass though the cabin. about 90 minutes from landing we were served a tea meal of sandwiches, scones jam, and a drink of our choice. You also have a pillow and blanket, bottle of water on both legs and you are given amenity kit on the outward leg to use on both legs. The head phones are collected at the end of both legs. Next thing we knew we were starting our descent into Cancun. The return flight was the same format but the food was local sourced but was a choice of beef stew and mash, Chicken and Potatoes, or the Veggie Option. The food was tasty and afterwards the cabin lights were dimmed to allow people to sleep. Any drinks etc were ordered from your seat by ringing the call bell. We did have a duty free trolley service whilst waiting for the hot meal, About 90 minutes before landing we had a breakfast service of Omelette, Tomato, and Hash Brown which was very nice. Next thing we were on finals to land at Gatwick. I think the TUI premier economy product is very good value for money, the inflight entertainment is very good and has a good range of films, TV, games, music. Would I travel Premier Economy again? Yes.

### "total lack of communication"
Got to Rhodes airport early as wanted to get through security and relax and get a seat before flight, flight was said to be half hour late. Airport packed couldn’t get a seat, queue the length of hallway for toilets. Called for flight later than told then had to stand another 35 minutes till they got everyone on a bus. Eventually took off got to Glasgow, had to wait 12 minutes after landing to get stairs in place then luggage took over an hour to be unloaded from the flight. All in all a total lack of communication from everyone and a flight that’s 4 hours turned in a 8 hour ordeal

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
After reading the reviews I was pleasantly surprised. On the outward journey it was on time, plane was clean and cabin crew were on hand if needed. The return leg was the same apart from a 1 hour delay which the pilot made 30 minutes on arrival back in London. This is a no frills airline catered for holidayers and what you see is what you get, if you're expecting legacy long haul service you'll be disappointed.

### "you can only use card and not cash"
Not Verified |   Ridiculous how you can only use card and not cash anymore, cash is legal tender and best to keep cashflow incase services go down, everyone is talking about this and now buying snacks and drinks at airport to take on plane as can't use cash, people will boycott the online service if this keeps up, most people exchange there euros into cash for there holidays to keep track of spending instead of unexpected card charges while going abroad. There was 12 of us which did not buy anything on plane so what a loss of money due to that alone

### “literally like playing roulette”
Not Verified | AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME AND MONEY - booking with Tui is literally like playing roulette, you pay your money but can't rely on any service, can assume there will be NO communication and there's no redress if all of the above happens - which it probably will. (based on our experience which we shall not be repeating) We had a series of issues before our holiday and during the holiday which I won't bore you with... these were then compounded by arriving at our departure airport to be told (at the check in desk with zero communication prior) our flight to Birmingham UK was cancelled and we would be returning to gatwick on a flight some six hours later (also delayed) I enquired how we would get home (3hrs away) and was told buses had been organised to transport ourselves and fellow affected passengers to BHX which wasn't great but better than nothing right - haha, well as it turns out... On arrival to Gatwick we were shocked to find that no one from Tui was there to greet us and when I eventually went off and found some Tui staff on the departures level above; they claimed they have only been told of the issue '10-15 minutes ago' Furthermore, we were then told buses were holding off off site and would be called in once all passengers were accounted for which was an issue as they 'were waiting for a manifest' After some time it was announced there was a 'delay on the buses' which, it was reasonably clear had not been 'waiting around the corner' at all and we were told we could wait, but not for how long and advised we should organise our own journey to BHX which we did via Uber at the cost of £217! (the airport taxis had just quoted a fellow passenger £400) Since our return in July we have received no proactive communication from Tui to apologise or even acknowledge our experience, at least that was not in response to our complaint and have been offered the taxi fare and £70 in holiday vouchers - it would be hilarious if it were not so insulting. Honorable mention is due to the filthy seat trays covered in food and drink stains we had to wipe down the accumulation of dirt in the seats and pockets and the inedible food - rice overcooked so much it was fun on crunchy for example. In what other industry does a company utterly fail and expect full payment for service not delivered or delivered partially or badly?

### "only gripe is the lack of space"
Not Verified |   Tui had a straightforward boarding service and their time keeping to and back from the destination was good. My only gripe is the lack of space, the aircrafts aisle is barely 20 inches wide and all the toilet doors open outwards which make it awkward, would be better to install folding or sliding loo doors.

### "Had a wonderful flight"
Not Verified |   Had a wonderful flight. There was a female black flight attendant who looked after my pregnant daughter and I very well. She went into depth about flight safety and when we arrived at our destination, gave advice on how to manage the hot weather . She was pleasant and friendly to everyone.

### "I’d fly with TUI again"
Seats in economy cabin very comfortable compared to a lot of airlines. The hot meal was of good quality, however on a 13 hour flight it was the only hot meal and a small roll before landing. You need 2 hot meals on such a long flight, we were so hungry when we got off the aircraft. Half of the crew were tui Scandinavia crew they were lovely very glam and hard working, the uk based crew could learn a lot from these guys. The uk based crew on my flight out looked a mess and done the bare minimum and weren’t very pleasant. Drinks were plentiful also which they only served at specific times throughout the flight as I heard them say no to a few people when they asked outside of the service, I think this is great, stops people getting drunk and annoying on a long flight which makes it more pleasant for everyone. The 13 hours went quickly and I’d fly with TUI again.

### “Food was dire”
Economy is economy and it’s never ideal let’s be honest, however the seats were ok and the flight was bearable. Crew done their job satisfactorily. Food was dire, on a 11 hour 45 flight you get one hot meal( which is barely 2 mouthfuls) and snack pack half way through the flight full of sugary biscuits and a Kit Kat etc then before Landing a yogurt and a croissant. I’d definitely advise to take your own food. Inflight entertainment very basic. Toilets filthy and falling to bits all covered with tape. Tui is definitely not Emirates but it could have been a lot worse. You get what you pay for.

### "exit seats worth the extra"
Return leg was changed to a Boeing 737 Max, though the outbound one was a Boeing 737 800 as usual. Layout the same , though the Max was noticeably quieter re engine noise etc. Both flights pretty good. Aircraft clean and staff efficient. Overwing exit seats worth the extra on a longish haul down to the Canaries. As so often the case there was no consistency on the baggage rules being implemented. The check in staff at Norwich were very 'jobsworth' enforcing the 25kg rule (I was a couple over...my oversight), and I was duly marched off like a naughty schoolboy to pay the fine. However at TFS, with exactly the same cases/weight, the (Iberia) check in clerk did not bother, and indeed asked us if we wanted to check in more , free of charge. Just do not see the point of upsetting passengers as it's obviously not necessary.

### “Pleasant enough flights”
Not Verified | Day-before baggage drop before an early departure was very good and very welcome. Security screening at 05:00 at Birmingham was a dog's breakfast, but that's not the fault of TUI. Pleasant enough flights in both directions, with surprisingly comfortable slimline seats (but be aware that it gets quite cold next to an emergency exit!) It's a standard economy service, with paid-for refreshments and no in-flight entertainment - and there's the big problem. These flights are between 5 and 6 hours, so getting close to, say, UK to Dubai flight time. I really would hope for some refreshments to be thrown in (even BA manages a very pleasant sandwich box in economy on the shorter route to Cairo) and, while I am happy to read, the option of some movies ought to be there for this length of flight. A particular 'shout out' to the pilots on the return trip, who landed skillfully on the first attempt during a storm that had caused many diversions and cancelled flights.

### “6.5 hour flight was a nightmare”
I know that cabin crew are busy people and have to be careful what they say to passengers, but I sat through 6.5 hours of mayhem. Children were running about during the whole flight, and the father of a boy in front of us changed his son's messy nappy on the seatback food tray. A child crawled under my seat and one vomited on my backpack. The parents of the children had absolutely no respect for other passengers, but surely cabin crew could, and should, have intervened. There is no complimentary food on TUI flights under six hours, but with a late take-off and allowing the running and screaming children to carry on, the 6.5 hour flight was a nightmare. I'll try and refrain from flying with TUI in the future.

### "Don’t trust any promises made by TUI"
Not Verified |  Further to a change in the plane TUI had planned to use, our pre booked and pre paid seats were given away to another party that had decided to sit in them. The plane was utter chaos because of this group. We, a family of four, had to stand at the back of the plane for half an hour, carrying a hysteric 2 year old and an 8 year old whilst new seats were found. Not a great start to an expensive holiday. We were offered £20 per person (the party next to us were offered £30 per person) as a refund to take alternative seats that we have booked and paid for. Being the nice family we are we took to offer, mostly, to help the over whelmed air hostesses. We even signed for this arrangement. On arrival back to the UK TUI have not honoured the refund. The refunds that the air hostess had agreed and signed for on the plane at the time of the chaos. Utterly disappointed. Don’t trust any promises made by TUI. Their customer service are now ignoring me.

### "crew were friendly and efficient"
Not Verified |  Glasgow - Verona - Glasgow. Both flights were fully booked. Both flights were on time and crew on both legs were friendly and efficient. Seats were extra legroom and were fine for my 6'3 frame. All in all a pleasant experience. Verona airport is currently undergoing work for the winter Olympics in 2026 and I'll review it separately.

### "much better than BA or Virgin"
Not Verified | I was very impressed with economy service levels. After flying long haul with BA and Virgin, Tui long haul was a first. The aircraft was light and airy without any sense of claustrophobia. The crew worked very hard outbound serving plenty of drinks and the meals were good. The crew were professional but approachable and the inflight entertainment very watchable. The journey back offered less however was overnight. The breakfast was a bit of a disappointment as we were promised a hot meal, but had some cold items. I actually slept for a number of hours and being tall, this is quite an achievement for me! Overall, much better than BA or Virgin.

### "fly with Ryanair next time"
Not Verified |  Tui app was down so I couldn't check in online. A member of staff said the app isn't compatible with Google! Flight home was delayed by 4 hours. I rang the taxi driver who was picking me up from the airport. He said he'd check the flight arrival time online. But the Tui flight tracker wasn't working so he couldn't check.. The poor taxi driver was waiting for 2 hours at the airport. Many people I've spoken to have had similar experiences over the last 2 years. Ryanair are far more competent. I'll definitely fly with Ryanair next time.

### "Would not recommend it at all"
Terrible experience from the minute I I got to the airport. Total chaos at the check in. Plane old, seats were the most uncomfortable I’ve ever experienced, hardly any legroom, seats worn out and almost no cushioning left. Not the best for 4 hours flight. Crew on the outbound flight were miserable and unfriendly, cabin manager was terrible, rolled his eyes and he definitely didn’t want to be there. Would not recommend it at all

### "I would avoid at all costs"
First time travelling with TUI, I have to say the service offering for a nearly 6 hour flight was far from adequate. TUI class this route as mid haul so it’s buy onboard, it would be fine if you had the option to pre-order meals like Jet2 offer but they done. There were 2 trolley services and the cabin crew appeared disinterested and rather unfriendly. It’s also a cashless airline, they only allow you to use a credit/debit card and unable to accept pre pay cards like Revolut or Monzo, again not helpful as there is no alternative then to buy onboard. The 737-8 Max whilst nice and new, simply isn’t big enough for this length of flight with only 3 toilets and no IFE. The queues for toilets were 10 deep for most of the flight. For the reasons above and it feeling like a cash grab by TUI I would avoid at all costs. They really could learn a thing or 2 from Jet2 (who seem to have got this kind of flying spot on).

### "worst check in experience ever"
Not Verified |  One of the worst check in experience ever. In theory, you can get the boarding pass online, but I tried on this flight (and in a couple of other flights) to get it with the app and from the website. Always failed. Call the number, and the operator is very nice and tries hard to appease you, telling you they will look into it and try later, but it simply does not work. So, to get the boarding pass you need to go to the airport check-in where inevitably you find a single very long line, rolling out to the outside of the airport entrance of the departure hall. The line is not even sorted by destinations or by departure times. Many Tui staff in uniform "hanging around" to "assist you", but no real help is provided. Despite operating in an Italian airport the staff does not speak Italian, but only English. Appalling service. I will certainly try to avoid this company in the future.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  Terrible service. Just back from a lovely holiday in Crete, while hotel and resort was fine, we would never travel with TUI again. The seats on the plane were extra small, could hardly get tray down and trying to get bag under seat during flight was impossible. Heraklion airport was the worst airport I was ever in, it was like a cattle market, thousands of people with not enough seating. No air conditioning, flights cancelled, diverted and delayed, we were delayed nearly 3 hours. As much as we loved Crete, never again.

### "if it's your only choice"
Not Verified |  The flight was better in some areas than I expected, not so good in others. I booked this flight with TUI in around February. I didn't expect much as this was a budget airline but I didn't expect it to be terrible. To start with: ground service. I don't mean to moan but a 2 hour ground delay after boarding before spending another 8 hours in the same seat wasn't exactly nice. Secondly: the seats. Legroom wasn't great but it was bearable - I'm pretty big so that was expected for the most part. The food surprised me (in a good way) quite good food. Keep in mind food on the return will not be as good from America though. The crew were nice I suppose, nothing special. The IFE wasn't great but it was fine considering it's a leisure airline. Would I recommend TUI Long Haul? Yes if it's your only choice.

### "delivering a way below par service"
Delayed take off - no issue with this. Flying from a skiing trip you do expect the weather to possibly delay things. On arrival at Manchester it took 1 hour 25 minutes for the cases to filter through from the aircraft to the luggage belt. No explanation! No staff around to ask. Incredibly frustrating. A 98 minute flight took over 10 hours including the time from resort; 3 pick ups, delays in take off and delays with luggage handlers. Very poor TUI. Manchester is an international airport but sadly your ground crew delivering a way below par service.

### "a great experience today"
Just come off a flight from Gatwick to Fuerteventura. Absolutely fantastic flight. Captain was very polite greeting all the passengers when we disembarked with a smile. In the cabin manager BJ was superb. He and the rest of the crew did a great job by making customers feel special which is unusual in today's climate. Plane was completely full but was clean on arrival. The only negative was we were 2hrs delayed from Gatwick. Well done TUI for a great experience today.

### "crew were welcoming and helpful"
We were due to fly out of Tenerife south at 9am on Saturday 11 March. On boarding the crew were welcoming and helpful. We got settled in our seats, and the captain made an announcement. Due to the French Air Traffic Controllers' strike, we might be delayed takeoff by about 40 minutes. About 30 mins later, he made a further announcement that there was more delay. However, within 10 minutes, he was back with an update, he'd decided on a different route, but had to order more fuel. He kept us up to date on route and the weather in Aberdeen throughout the journey. The crew did an amazing job in difficult circumstances.

### "not impressed with Tui"
Not Verified | To be fair, I don't know whether this is partly an airport fault. We were booked on a flight due for take off at 2.50pm. The airport board said check in opened 12.20. We joined the queue at 12.15. Check in did not start until 12.30, and then only one desk, not two, for another few minutes. At the departure lounge, the board said gate displayed 2.15. At 2.15 we went to Gate 1, which we had been advised of by Special Assistance. I have a problem with steps so required the lift to the plane. When the flight was announced, we were taken to the lift, which has comfy seats, fortunately. We could see the other passengers queuing in the cold wind and gathering clouds. At 2.30, the fueller was still operating. The Special Assistance guy looked in the cabin through the window, tried the emergency door, but there was no response at first. We could see the cockpit crew in the plane. All I can assume is that cleaning took longer than usual. Given that the flight was supposed to take off at 2.50, the delay in boarding seems odd, but then so does fuelling, when the plane had been standing for about an hour, and the airport was anything but busy. Eventually, about 2.40, the cabin crew opened the door and we were allowed entry. The plane was beautifully clean. The cabin crew were smiley and friendly, but how those poor people with toddlers and babies, who had been standing in the cold were feeling, I have no idea. Incidentally, the stance Tui uses is quite a walk from the terminal, and only part of it is under cover. Given the inclement weather conditions in Aberdeen generally, it's unfortunate, to say the least. BA has covered airbridges from the terminal for its flights. Maybe it's a cost thing for Tui? The pilot announced something about possibly missing our slot, worst case scenario half hour wait. We either were allowed to go late or stole another flight's slot but took off fairly quickly. However, both hubby and myself noticed excessive air pressure change on take off and landing of this flight. It's not something we've noticed before. I can't say it was a different aircraft- it looked like any other Just not impressed with Tui this time around. It has always been my flight provider of choice, but I maybe need to think again.

### "flight is worse than Ryanair"
This flight is worse than Ryanair cheap seats. Paid premium for extra space seats and what a joke that was given that as they were filled for free by those that did not pay the premium as soon as we were ready to take off (lucky them). Also premium for what, seats were uncomfortable, barely big enough for someone like me who is only 65kg and 5'2". Service in flight was shabby if not woeful. Have a return ticket back to London with TUI and will definitely not be travelling with this joke of an airline again after this. People are not cattle, stop treating them like farm animals and give them what they pay for.

### "Absolute farce and will never use them again"
Not Verified |  The pilot didn't show up for our flight. Last flight of the day, all shipped off to hotels - some of our flight ended up in Heathrow hotels so not even local. No prioritising families so we ended up with a double room for a family of 5 with 3 of us on the floor. TUI have been 'investigating' our complaint for 2 months. The result? A standard email saying they're sorry and will pass our feedback on to the relevant team. Absolute farce and will never use them again. I advise others to do the same and hope that TUI don't survive this recession.

### "plane left more than 3 hours late"
The worst, the plane left more than 3 hours late, and then landed with 2:48 hours in Cancun, and 50 minutes on the runway, waiting for our turn to stop due to the delay. More than 15 people lost air or bus connections to our final destinations. At this it was after 6 o'clock, they sent a person to show his face and nothing trained to resolve but simply put the complaint online, I stayed in a country that I do not know at 8:00 at night looking for a hotel, another flight for the next day at a very expensive price, trying to get a taxi, changing to the local currency to have cash. The food on the plane, the small portions even I eat little. No one in the crew speaks even 10% of Spanish and they are landing at a Spanish-speaking airport. Nor was there an option for Spanish or subtitles in the entertainment. They did not give a glass of water and food, even less as I said, not even a decent meal on the flight. Please do not buy from them, as of today they say that they landed with a delay of only 2:48, which indicates that they expedited the flight, putting everyone at risk just so as not to exceed the 3 hours of delay with which we had already taken off. There is no communication. Lo peor, el avion salió con mas de 3 horas de retraso, y luego aterrizo con 2:48 horas en Cancun, y 50 minutos en pista, esperando turno para detenernos debido al atraso. mas de 15 personas perdimos conexiones aéreas o en buses a nuestros destinos finales. A esto eran las pasadas las 6, mandaron a una persona a dar la cara y nada capacitada para resolver sino simplemente que pusiéramos la queja en linea, me quede en país que no conozco a las 8:00 de la noche buscando hotel, otro vuelo para el siguiente día a un precio carísimo, intentando conseguir taxi, cambiando a la moneda local para tener efectivo. También agrego: 1. La comida en el avion, las porciones pequeñas incluso yo que como poco. 2. Nadie en la tripulación habla ni el 10% de español y están aterrizando en un aeropuerto de habla hispana. Tampoco en el entretenimiento había opción a español ni en subtítulos. 3. No dieron ni un vaso de agua y comida pues menos como decia ni en el vuelo una comida decente. Por favor no compren con ellos, al día de hoy dicen que aterrizaron con un retraso solo de 2:48 lo cual indica que el vuelo lo agilizaron poniendo en riesgo a todos solo para no pasar las 3 horas de atraso con las que ya habíamos despegado. Verificare esta información y la verán en redes de los otros pasajeros afectados también . No hay ni comunicación.

### "A wonderful flight"
A wonderful flight with TUI in July. A very special aircraft with a very interesting history taking us down to Kefalonia. The first time I have been on an plane since before the covid pandemic. The crew were lovely and the views out the window are a whole new level. Very interesting seeing France, Belguim, Germany, the Adriatic sea, and the Italian Islands including Dias before making a beautiful approach in to EFL, seeing Zaknythos before touching down quite hard with 6 minutes to spare and a flight time of just 2 hours and 50minutes. G-TUKF has an all-white livery due to being delivered from Pegasus Airlines only 4 months prior. She was originally built in 2006 for Ryanair as EI-DPE. In 2013 she became TC-IZG, operating for Pegasus Airlines. She joined TUI Airways in March 2020 and has been operating for TUI ever since.

### "A disappointing experience"
A disappointing experience from start to finish. Both outbound and inbound flights had delays. A 6 hour delay on the outbound and a 2 hour delay on the inbound. Both of which were poorly communicated and managed. We paid for extra space seats and although the extra leg room was average the seat pitches were very small. This is in comparison to budget airlines that we normally fly with. Where the planes normally have 6 seats a row, the TUI aircrafts had 8 seats per row and although I believe this was a significantly bigger plane it was not big enough to accommodate people comfortably.

### TUI Airways customer review
Superb service from start to finish. Clean cabin, pristine in fact. Light blue mood lighting. Plenty of cabin storage for luggage. Two cabin crew teams doing meal services and a duty free run at the end. Pilot kept us informed throughout with regular updates. Smooth boarding and disembarkation. An absolute joy compared to some Short Haul carriers.

### "The flight was okay"
Not Verified |  The flight was okay, I think it was worth the money, the seats were quite comfortable. The toilets were clean, and the prices were quite fair. The only downside was that this was a night flight and the lights were on the whole flight except takeoff and landing. We did have a 3 hour delay but I believe this isn’t TUI’s fault, great airline.

### "it was a very pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  I was very impressed with my booking and flight. The staff on my flight were amazing and it was a very pleasant experience. It's really nice to be mindful and grateful when you experience good service. Thank you.

### "a fantastic flight"
What a fantastic flight. Premium seats comfortable. The food was lovely and presented in a premium style. Cabin Manager Sandra and her team were fantastic and very attentive. Thank you for the wonderful experience.

### "The flight was reasonable"
Arrived and prompt check in. Aware of 30 minute delay at check in, this was 2 hours by the time we departed. Basic cabin so no pre departure lounge etc. Aircraft flown in from Manchester Quick turnaround, boarding ok. Staff attentive and friendly. Good announcements from pilot. After take off, drinks round which was fine. Meal service was ok (chicken and pasta). Overall I thought this was all fine. IFE, music not allowed due to Covid which seemed odd. Films were fine. The flight was reasonable, toilets were their let down. There were 4 for an economy cabin and these were not policed often enough. In their defence though, the cabin crew were busy throughout.

### "aircraft not clean"
Not Verified |  Flights outbound & return very good however, aircraft not clean. Tea & coffee stains on panel in front of extra legroom seats and table holders in seats full of crumbs, tables stained & sticky and this was a morning flight out of Manchester. Considering we are wearing masks and advised on hand hygiene and reducing infection risk I thought the infection prevention controls measures on this aircraft were very poor, they weren’t much better on the return flight either.

### "6 hour flight without IFE"
Nicely presented, recently purchased Boeing 737. Relatively comfortable seats, decent staff and a Buy on board service. However a 6 hour flight without IFE is hard work! In addition, there was only a single drinks service on the return flight and there was no effort made to allow passengers to ask for drinks .

### "Captain and crew were very informative"
Overall my flight with TUI was great. Captain and crew were very informative and friendly and had a comfortable flight to Gran Canaria. I sat on seat 17a which I picked and the seat was reasonably comfortable for a 4 hour flight and this flight was meant to be on 737-800 and for a picky person into aviation this was a huge bonus as we were given TVs. Food and drink was offered however I got myself a Burger King prior to the flight however I did get a Diet Coke on the flight - forgot the price. We landed in quite hard and my favourite bit - the airport. Getting through the first part of immigration was fast and easy but when we had to joint the vaccination/covid test line which had 2 desks and 4 flights that was terrible. Then the baggage we had to wait almost 2 hours for due to a mix up made us even more tired and stressed. Anyway the general flight was great and I praise TUI and their crew.

### "the crew were absolutely great"
Not Verified |  This was my 4th time with TUI! This flight was probably my best flight with them as the crew were absolutely great and we were on a 787-9 Dreamliner on a 3.45 minute flight. My only issue was boarding took ages and were using 1 bus but that’s not TUIs problem. We landed 1 hour late but that was fine with me. Baggage at Birmingham took 45 mins which is not very good- Overall a great experience.

### "planes are quite basic and uncomfortable"
Both our outgoing flight and returning flights departed late. The outgoing flight was an hour late although we were all on the plane on time. The return flight departed 45 minutes late as only one staff member was working the gate. This was very frustrating as we have flown with TUI on a number of occasions which we have experienced delays. TUI planes are quite basic and uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight and the food and drinks onboard are expensive. Staff onboard the plane are friendly.

### "not enforcing basic hygiene rules"
On our flight no. TB181 from Brussels to Punta Cana on 15/08/2021, we sat in the Deluxe section and while the flight crew was very nice, a lot of passengers either weren’t wearing any masks at all and only had them hanging from their chins, or some just had them on to cover their mouths but not their noses. On such a long flight, I expected to see everyone wearing their masks correctly (except for eating & drinking, but people were not wearing their masks (correctly) for hours). The flight crew didn’t say anything, only when I asked them directly they managed to ask a woman in front of us to put on her mask. She did, but as soon as the flight attendant was gone, she made an obscene gesture towards a sign that told the passengers to wear masks and proceeded to free her nose. When we in process of landing, one of the flight attendants was standing directly in front of us, next to us was a man that didn’t wear any mask at all and loudly talked to his neighbour in the middle row. Both didn’t wear their masks, but the flight attendant didn’t say anything at all. I am very disappointed with the crew and especially with TUI fly for not enforcing basic hygiene rules despite the Covid-19 pandemic still going on. I will not be flying with Tui again despite having flown with them for years and I regret already having booked the return flight to Brussels because this shows the company doesn’t care for their passengers’ safety at all. To be truthful, I was horrified at how little the crew seemed to care - they were busy chatting next to the kitchen while half the plane was sitting without masks.

### "this company is the worst I ever seen"
Not Verified |  After several times contacting the customer services of this company, I am still waiting for an answer about why I didn't get the email cancellation before arriving at the airport, it cost me more than £150 to get the refund of my tickets. All the times I tried to contact customer services by phone (by email was impossible as they never send emails back), they hung up the phone without any reason. I can say that this company is the worst I ever seen, they are unprofessional and irresponsible.

### "excellent value for money"
This was our first time flying with TUI airways (UK) and we were surprised by the standard of service offered in this restricted time with the corvid restrictions. The boarding at Gatwick was done in a corvid safe manner and the cabin crew explained that a face mask had to be worn for the duration of the flight and whist in the arrival airport in Corfu. The Cabin Services Manager explained that due to Corvid there movement in the cabin was to be kept to a minimum and there would only be the 2 rear toilets in customer use and teh=at there was only t be a maximum of 4 passengers standing at any one time, also the there would only be one cabin service of food and drinks. We were given regular updates form the cockpit which were clear and friendly. The pilots pointed out places of interest on the route down to Corfu. Arrival at Corfu and deplaning was well organised and the Cabin Crew controlled the exit of the aircraft onto the waiting coaches. The flight back to Gatwick was an evening flight and again the Cabin Service manager explained that there were only 2 rear toilets for customer use and there would only be one drinks service. However, there was a tax free trolley has well on this flight has the banned had been lifted. Again, we had informative updates from the cockpit and were als able to follow the route on the drop down TV cabin Screens. On landing into Gatwick the exiting was well controlled by rows and seemed to be well practiced by the crew.. The onboard menu is very similar to other offered and is very reasonable in price and the food and drinks purchased was very good value for money. We did pay the extra for an extra legroom seat which was a good investment and there was plenty of legroom. Yes we would fly TUI airlines again and found the product to be excellent value for money.

### "£84 just to choose a standard seat"
When you book the flights on TUI website, it takes your seat upgrade money before it shows you what seats are available and what extra space you get for your money, which is wrong! After booking and paying, it said we only get extra 2 inches legroom for (£78 for 2 people). When I changed it, I was then charged a £40 amendment fee. I was basically charged £84 just to choose a standard seat, when Easyjet would be £16. The selfish TUI airline staff also shut the front aircraft toilets to public and kept it to themselves, and all people on aircraft had to use rear toilets. When I complained to TUI about people queueing in aisle and standing over me, I was lied to and told all airline companies have done the same during Covid 19 pandemic, which is a lie as Easyjet kept all toilets open to public on flight in same week. When I complained to TUI their response was the most unsympathetic, unapologetic customer service response I have every received. I will never book a holiday or fly with TUI again.

### "we were 4 minutes late"
Gatwick to Enfidha. We were denied check as we were 4 minutes late this morning and have now been told we will lose our package holiday. This is absurd we were late by 4 minutes only, plenty time to clear customs and board, minutes late and this is how we have been treated. Told to deal with it with your insurance company.

### "Nothing was too much trouble"
Not Verified |  Due to Storm Ciara our flight was delayed by several hours and then we flew to East Midlands airport with onward coaches arranged to Gatwick. The Captain, came into the cabin many times to keep us updated at every stage and to answer any questions. He also offered trips/pics in the cockpit. The crew were great too. Nothing was too much trouble. We would like to pass on our appreciation for the great communication during a difficult time.

### "economy seat with limited legroom"
Not Verified |  We flew out to the West Indies two weeks earlier and had an excellent flight; we were pleasantly surprised and before disembarking I told the cabin crew how much we had enjoyed the flight. The aircraft was clean and tidy and the crew were very friendly and efficient with the in-flight catering was more than acceptable. What helped, perhaps, was that we left at 1000 and had a daytime flight heading west. We also found subsequently that we were in 'extra legroom seats' and this made a huge difference. The homeward flight left Barbados at 1700 and effectively became a night flight heading east with breakfast served at 0330(UK Time) or 2330 (Barbados time). We were also in a standard economy seat with limited legroom. I am 1m82 and found it difficult to get comfortable. When i reclined my seat after dinner the passenger behind took offence. If one pays economy prices one does not expect frills but it might be worth obtaining one of the 'extra legroom seats' on any longer flight.

### "we were pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew from Birmingham to Palma and ten days later we returned with TUI. On both occasions we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the planes, the cheerfulness & helpfulness of the crew, professionalism of the pilot and the overall flying experience. Gripes include poor sound over the PA, making pilot messages unintelligible; lack of legroom; and the usual hard-sell that economy passengers have to endure for much of the flight. Our return was marred by horrendous Swissport handling mistakes that centred on misplaced landing /e xit steps (a 25 minute delay while these were repositioned) followed by over an hour's wait for our luggage to be loaded onto carousel #6. They offered no explanation or apology for these failings.

### "efficient staff and service"
Not Verified | Flew LGW to Naples to join cruise ship and vice versa. Very impressed with the efficient staff and service on board. Cabin crew and flight deck crew all informative and pleasant. Plenty of room on the Dreamliner, very quiet on take off compared to the average plane. Staff apologetic about the chaos at Naples airport seems it is quite usual! All in all a good experience with this airline.

### "I wont book with them again"
Not Verified |  Booked a holiday to Kos on a Boeing 787 with TUI. ended up saying it was switched to Norwegian which is fine but then a month before booking was told we would be on one of three other airlines which eventually was Smartlynx. The Smartlynx plane we were flown on was plain white, 25 years old and cramped more than ive ever experienced. The table when down literally gave you no space at all, I cant image what its like for taller/ larger people. I appreciate there can be some changes to the plane (as per T&C's!!) but to move us from a new bigger aeroplane when we also had extra legroom to help with two young children to a small old cramped plane is unacceptable. They just don't compare. I wont book with them again as you cant rely on them to just change what you booked and not even a fair like for like change!

### "the worst customer service"
Stansted to Tenerife. TUI has the worst customer service. We flew with them in July and our flight was delayed over 24 hours - we were never given an explanation and no one in Tui seemed to know what was going on - it was totally chaotic. We lost a days holiday and have tried to contact them to complain but it is impossible to get hold of them! We have phoned, emailed, even emailed the Chief Exec - nothing! We will keep going but seriously don’t fly with them they are rubbish.

### "this was one of the shabbiest aircraft's"
Operated for TUI by Olympus, this was one of the shabbiest aircraft's I’ve ever flown on. The interior looked like it needed a good scrub, my seat cushion and that of my husband next to me kept coming away and the armrest to the left of my seat was missing making it very uncomfortable (the visible metal to which it should have attached had been covered with a bit of silver tape). One of toilets also had no water in the taps. We paid for and got extra legroom next to the emergency exit but the seats didn’t recline and were so thinly padded they were uncomfortable. As the flight wasn’t full some others were moved to similar seats across the aisle but cabin crew failed to explain to them(as they did to us) what to do in the unlikely event of needing to evacuate via that exit (surely a breach of safety regulations). The jump seat in front of us was filthy and what looked like old tissues fell out when the crew member opened it. The Olympus crew were reasonably friendly and smart unlike the Tui staff who were completely offhand, surly and seemed only interested in selling. They certainly didn’t understand customer experience. Definitely not recommended.

### "the worst airline I have flown"
Manchester to Tenerife South. From check in to arrival at the destination, everything about this flight was awful. The staff at Manchester airport check in were unfriendly and gave the impression they were doing you a favour being there at all. The cabin crew spent the first 20 minutes having a gossip with each other and sharing drinks. They were surly and scruffy (one cabin crew member had a skirt with the hem coming undone) and were only interested in selling, food, drinks and scratch cards. There was nothing resembling customer service. We paid for extra legroom seats which offered no extra legroom at all because the aircraft type was changed before departure. We didn’t buy the on board food but those nearby who did ended up with something resembling a dish sicked up by a dog. This is truly the worst airline I have flown with and definitely won’t be repeating the experience

### "I would not recommend TUI"
Not Verified |  Cardiff to Palma. Had to pay extra £50 to sit next to relative which wasn't explained during booking. Flight delayed. Put on ASL Airline not TUI. Got diverted to Toulouse. TUI unable to get fuel there as no contract to do so. This led to further delay. All in all the experience was awful. I would not recommend TUI.

### "dull as dishwater B757"
Not Verified |  Larnaca to Manchester. I recently enjoyed a holiday with my family group of 7 consisting of 4 adults and 3 children. The first point is with regard to the online check-in service on the outward flight. My wife and I have always checked in via the normal procedure at the check in desk. My daughter preferred the online method. To my mind, our use of the unfamiliar touch screen procedure seemed no quicker than letting an experienced check-in desk assistant carry out the task. One of my daughter's cases was found to be 2.5kg over the modest 15kg allowance. There is every chance that a person may waive this minor indiscretion, but the online system is totally abitrary culminating in a £45 surcharge, this was later waived by a TUI assistant to be fair. Moving onto the flight itself there were no issues of note other than being on a dull as dishwater Boeing 757. Very basic. The week long holiday at Tofinis Hotel near Ayia Napa was great, enjoyed the food etc. No probs. On the return flight we found it to be delayed just prior to the return transfer. 2 hours on a late night flight but no major issues, these things happen. However, it was common knowledge amongst the passengers due to internet checks but on arrival, the TUI rep chose not to mention it. I sort of understand that because why would anyone make themselves the focal point of peoples frustration if you dont have to. Onto the flight and again we found ourselves on the rather tired looking 757. I suspect TUI are suffering due to the grounding of the 737 max of which they were the biggest customers and I understand the company's predicament. The flight was adequate and on landing at Manchester we found the airport was disorganised due in part to procedural disruption arising from the ongoing terminal expansion. We were held on the plane and kept informed over the tannoy by a clearly irritated member of the cabin crew who informed us that we needed to be bused from the tarmac to terminal and the airport hadn't been expecting us! Half an hour later we were disembarking and the journey was complete. The following day I felt as rough as sandpaper, cold symptoms and a sore throat. I cannot conclusivly put this down to the plane journey but it is known that changes in air pressure can cause physiological effects like toothache and joint pain. Having taken trips on the uber modern TUI Dreamliners with their humidified cabin air I had forgotten just how rough an old plane could leave you feeling. I hope for TUI's sake that their fleet problems can be resolved sooner rather than later.

### "I think we have identified a training need"
I have holidayed in Corfu for the last 25 years and appreciate that the runway is short. The outbound flight landing has to be the worst I have ever experienced, to my mind we were approaching too high and too fast. We landed heavily with the aircraft lurching from side to side, hanging on for dear life - not a pleasant start to the holiday! The return flight started positively but on the approach to London Stansted we came down in fits and starts causing a lot of anxiety. Other passengers were also concerned about the roller coaster descent and there was huge relief when the plane landed and eventually came to a halt. However we were left onboard without the doors being opened for almost half an hour after the engines had stopped with no explanation as to why. One bad landing can be excused but if this is normal for Tui pilots I think we have identified a training need!

### "I faced rudeness and sarcasm"
Thessaloniki to Birmingham. I had the worst customer experience with TUI services. I made the mistake to book a flight with them and they do not offer a check in online service (they advertise they do but their app, web page, customer support service is completely useless). I tried several times to contact them and complete my check in but no one was willing to help or even explain. Finally I arrived at the airport approximately 2 hours before my flight but I was not allowed to check in, although I didn't have any check in bags and my flight was delayed. As I result I missed my flight and I faced rudeness and sarcasm from TUI staff. Don't waste money or time to them.

### "I met such dirty plane"
Dublin to Kos. For the first time in my life I met such dirty plane. It's not that it has not been cleaned after the previous flight, it's dirt from a few months. Terrible food - cold and pale toast with ham. Cabin crew okay. I would like to say: never again, but I have to return with them

### "Very impressed"
Not Verified |  Doncaster to Menorca. I'm a very scared flyer and the pilots were amazing. They explained the route and weather conditions, and why and when the Aircraft would be turning to approach for landing. I'm really worried about the different noises in the plane and the reassurance from the pilots really made a difference. Very impressed. Thank you.

### "2 hours to check in"
Rhodes to Dublin. On way back we stood in line for 2 hours to check in. Then again for hour for security check. Then probably another hour for passport control before boarding. We were three hours early but flight ended up an hour late. Elderly and disabled stood for 3 hours.

### "Would absolutely repeat"
Girona to London Gatwick with TUI Airways. Everything about the experience was good. Ticket purchase, online check in, airport experience, flight, aircraft and crew were all better than expected. There were no games, tricks, past minute surprises. Would absolutely repeat.

### "impressed with the flight"
Aberdeen to Rhodes. This flight was operated by TUI’s sister airline Sunwing Airlines. The flight was included in a 2 week holiday on the island. The flight was full; however, due to it being during the school year most passengers were older or couples without children. One thing I have to say is I was surprised with the service on this 4 hour 42 minute flight. The menu had a wide variety of options and was reasonably priced, but there was no option to preorder a meal like with Thomas Cook or Jet2. The 6 person cabin crew consisted of 5 cabin crew and the TUI Airways Aberdeen base Manager. The crew were friendly, chatty and there to help in the cabin. They made some jokes during announcements, which was great. The pilots were informative. My seat was 8F and offered 29” of seat pitch, and recline which was enough. The toilets were checked regularly and they were clean, but on the small side. The landing into Rhodes airport was smooth but the airport, that is a story for a different time. Overall I am impressed with the flight considering it was the first time I flew with TUI Airways. One thing I do have to say is TUI Airways is a rather expensive airline for scheduled flights. My flight would have came out at around £300 round trip for my dates of travel. TUI Airways is the perfect airline if you have booked a holiday with TUI, just like I did, otherwise there are definitely cheaper options. I would recommend TUI Airways.

### "Very disappointed with TUI"
Manchester to Phuket. Very disappointed with TUI. Long Haul Flight Only includes no check in luggage. 7kg hand luggage is the only allowance included in advertised cost. It is then £35 each way for up to 20kg. It is then £16 to choose a seat. The check in is very long process. Waited 1hr 40 minutes as only 2 desks open for economy. No one checked my hand luggage for size and weight so their policy is void therefore a money making misleading scam. On board the staff were brash and let’s say tired looking shouting out “prosseco £20 Prosecco £20” Entertainment was laughable. Hardly anything to watch. Food mediocre. Toilets! Obviously not checked as smell of urine was strong and tissue not replenished. The whole experience was way below par. Never again.

### "Had a great flight"
Birmingham to Cancun. Had a great flight, the cabin crew were very helpful and looked after us throughout the flight. It was a great start to our holidays and am looking forward to our return flight

### "Delayed return to UK"
Not Verified |  Delayed return to UK with TUI Airways due to crew sent to wrong plane at London Gatwick on the outbound journey on the morning of 24/03/2019. They then tried to imply that the Italians were to blame for missed slot! Maybe if they had arrived on time they would have used the slot the were allocated. That was why we were then hungry on the flight and my daughter getting and trying to eat her pasta while we landed.

### "Served lovely snacks"
Not Verified |  Lanzarote to Birmingham. Great flight with TUI. Served lovely snacks, and had great in-flight deals. This is the second time I've flown with TUI, the first in December 2017 to Fuerteventura (also from BHX). Pilot gave us speeches, and handled the take-off and landing pretty well. I would definitely recommend it to other people wanting to travel to the Canaries. Unfortunately no wifi, but that may be the type of aircraft I flew.

### "praise TUI flight staff"
Not Verified |  Boa Vista to Manchester. I cannot praise TUI flight staff high enough either going out to Boa Vista on 31st Jan 2018 or coming back on 7th Jan. They were all so polite and friendly and nothing was too much trouble and certainly helped the long flight pass. On the way out a passenger took ill and this was dealt with efficiently and very calmly and the only reason we new about it was because a doctor was sitting in front of us and was asked for his help. I have difficulty walking so had ordered a wheelchair from the cabin to the baggage collection which didn't turn up and the whole crew waited with me and my family until it came, despite me telling them to go home they all refused, even the captain. Tui should be proud of having such exceptional staff managing their planes and dedication to looking after the passengers. I have booked holidays with Tui many times and they are always our preferred choice and will remain so.

### "dissatisfaction with this airline"
Gatwick to Guanacaste. A middling to poor experience for us, which we shall not repeat. The Boeing 787 is a nice aircraft, large windows & the famed pressurisation ensuring a higher level of comfort. However, the seats were showing signs of age and generally the plane was dirty, especially the toilets. Seating is also cramped in 3-3-3 layout. What is worse is the truly dreadful food, in way too small quantities, as well as the quite mediocre service, with some truly surly staff members (though not all). They also seat you apart randomly if you do not pay extra. For the price I found the experience to be sub-par, and I had a general feeling of dissatisfaction with this airline.

### "very happy with TUI"
Not Verified | Bristol to Orlando Sanford. We have been travelling to Florida for many years but have been using TUI exclusively over the last few visits for the following reasons. They use Orlando Sanford which our preferred airport to arrive and depart from due to its size and speed to travel through. The planes they use are relatively new against Virgin 747s (Over 30 years old) and BA 777 (20 plus years old). Leg room is generous for economy. Flights are generally on time, with the last visit in September 2018, both flights pushed back early. The food is okay for airline fare, with plenty of drink runs by the crew. Overall we have been very happy with TUI (and its predecessor Britannia) and will probably look to book with them again on our next visit. Well done TUI.

### "The flight was great"
Manchester to Cancun. The flight was great with no delays on either of the flights! The in flight entertainment had loads of films to watch as well as TV shows and a variety of games. The meals were great and lots of them and we even got complementary drinks and food too. Cabin crew really friendly and a good environment to spend a 11 hour flight in and really comfy as well. Definitely recommend!

### "service was excellent"
East Midlands to Orlando Sanford. The service was excellent. It was our first time flying from East Midlands and with TUI and both were exceptional. The cabin crew staff couldn’t do enough for us. The legroom was excellent. Choice of entertainment excellent and food was good too.

### "Delayed about 1 hour"
Ibiza to Bristol. Delayed about 1 hour. Bristol airport baggage information out of service. Baggage delivered about 1 hour after flight arrived and after other flights arrived. Not accepted.

### "would happily fly with them again"
Not Verified |  After stupidly leaving our passports two hours away, the TUI staff at Heraklion airport Greece were extremely helpful. Thanks to them, we made it on to the plane only to be greeted by a great duo who brought us lunch on board after hearing about our bad day! Wonderful experience of Tui and would happily fly with them again.

### "experience in airport not good"
Cardiff to Rhodes. The flights both ways were very good although outward in return flights were both delayed for a short while. The crew were excellent and very friendly and helpful. However, our experience in Rhodes airport was not good. We travelled as a party of nine; five adults, an eight year old, a six year old, a four year old and a three year old. As the lead member I felt responsible for our party. When we were directed to our check in desk I double checked with the Tui representative in the airport that we were at the Cardiff check in. Her reply was very patronising in its nature, "that's why I sent you here". She was not very pleasant at all. We were told briefly on the coach to the airport that we would have to weigh our luggage then take it to be scanned but I don't think it was explained clearly enough. However, the departure gate was very confusing. We were told that we were going from departure gate 7. We got there but the door was shut. We waited and eventually an airport assistant told us we had to go to passport control first then proceed through departure lounges 4, 5 & 6 to reach gate 7. We queued up after this only to realise that we were in the Luton queue, also going from gate 7. None of the monitors around us displayed the procedure. I understand that this is not Tui's fault but perhaps the representatives could explain this on the coach to the airport? This is not a complaint against Tui but a procedure which detracted from our good experience with Tui.

### "Shocked and appalled"
Gatwick to Liberia. Following a 24 hour delay because the TUI engineer could not replace a windscreen wiper quick enough led to me and my new wife missing ultimately 2 days from our honeymoon. Following advice I contacted the after travel claim line to receive the compensation I am entitled to under law. Following numerous emails to the designated address (yes I have read receipts set up) I have not even had an acknowledgment of my emails. It is an absolutely shocking service from a so called trusted provider. An absolute joke. I would highly recommend looking at other holiday providers as this is not the first time Tui have delayed me and let me down. Shocked and appalled by a clear ignorant brand who don’t look after their customers after they have spent good money.

### "never book with TUI ever again"
Aberdeen to Corfu  return. Temp was too cold, snack choice was rubbish. Even though we had a disabled child, and made this clear at booking, we were still at A and B seats (so had to sit with another person not in our party on the isle seat) meaning that every time my daughter needed the toilet or anything, we had to ask the man to move. He was very impatient and by the time we were on a return flight, we were forced to move seats, sitting separately. Really late boarding by over 1.5 Hours, departure area is terrible at Corfu Airport, so very very uncomfortable there, and there is no airport lounge. Food very expensive. Arrivrd back at Aberdeen in the early hours, too late to drive home, so had to spend night at airport. Airline staff OK but not very friendly or helpful, didn't listen to what was ordered. Would never book with TUI ever again.

### "overall good standard service"
Bristol to Naples. TUI Airways offer an overall good standard service. Both outbound and inbound flights were on time and the staff onboard were courteous and professional. The seats and inflight service are in line with other short-haul flights and budget airlines - was perfectly acceptable for a 3 hour flight. The only downside was ground crew (which were not TUI Airways) being a bit slow with the delivery of luggage, but that is partly due to the summer peak season. They are primarily geared up for passengers flying as part of a TUI/First Choice package holiday which means the fares are not great value, but since it was the only airline offering this route I was happy to fly with them and would consider doing so again.

### "service as a whole was very good"
Flight to Cancun, cabin premium. Evening check in of baggage at LGW is helpful if staying overnight at the airport and was easily done. As part of their premium package they include premium security passes and lounge access, security was quick, the No 1 traveller lounge was busy but fine for quick snack. The aircraft was only 4 months old so was clean and well presented. Welcome drinks offered shortly after priority boarding and Rituals amenity pack handed out. On time departure. The inflight service as a whole was very good, bar service after take off and menu choices taken crew very attentive with a real can do attitude. The first meal was nicely presented with main course brought out separately after started finished. Good inflight movies etc and regular bar services during flight for those that wanted it. A tasty afternoon tea was served prior to landing with sandwiches, Victoria sponge cake and scone/roddas clotted cream. The first officer made announcements during the flight which being both a day and leisure flight was a nice touch. Baggage off belt quickly. A very good flight. I have to conclude by saying that holding a high tier status with our flag carrier, they were the alternative consideration. However, having flown with them regularly, they would not have emulated the service TUI provided in their premium economy cabin and a 20 year old 777 would have struggled to compete with the Dreamliner!

### "farce at the bag drop"
CNot Verified | Manchester to Palma. Arrived 3 hours before our morning flight from Manchester to Palma. Done everything we were asked to do, had our printed boarding cards so all that was left was to drop off our luggage. When we arrived at terminal 2 we were greeted by a queue almost the full length of the terminal which we were told to join. After about 30 minutes we got to the zig zag line so thought that we would soon be through, only to find that the queue extended down the tunnel towards terminal 3 for some 200 metres, doubled back then you got to the zig zag queue. After almost 3 hours with our flight time approaching we got to the root of the problem. Only 3 tui staff supervising travellers to check in their luggage using the installed self serve machines. We managed to check most of our luggage in, but the machine wouldnt accept one of them. We asked for assistance 3 times and waited but got no assistance for over half an hour. We then had the security checks to contend with, which is another story. We eventually made the flight but only because all TUI flights had to be delayed due to the farce at the bag drop. Never again!

### "helpful and very friendly"
First time flying TUI long haul, this time from Manchester to Orlando Sanford. Very impressed on both legs. Staff genuinely helpful and very friendly. Flights left bang on time. Two rounds of free drinks 0 food not bad for economy. Afternoon Tea great. On return leg we had a row to ourselves. Would make it a priority to fly to Orlando with this operator again.

### "Check-in chaotic and disorganised"
Birmingham to Malaga. Check-in for the flight was extremely chaotic and disorganised. Queuing barriers were arranged near escalators causing unnecessary congestion and confusion amongst passengers. Airline staff were no where to be seen to offer assistance and guidance to passengers. Boarding seemed to go smoothly however this was probably because the Cabin Crew were not asking to see boarding passes. My seat was uncomfortable and unsupportive due to the padding being worn out. Food and drinks were very expensive (even at airline prices) so would recommend you buy in the airport before the flight. The in charge crew member was putting on some silly voice whilst making announcements which literally made me cringe and squirm in my seat. My seat area and tray table were filthy and the aircraft looked as though it had not been cleaned properly in a while e.g. large clumps of dust around air vents etc. Some of my travelling party are former cabin crew and spotted numerous things that the crew were not doing e.g. not checking boarding passes? How do you know who is getting on the plane. Noticed a crew member not allowing passengers to put their bags in emergency equipment compartments however then noticed the same crew member shoving her own shoes, coat and toiletries bags in the same area? Crew in general seemed very complacent when going about their duties.

### "operated by Sunwing"
Norwich to Rhodes. TUI flight in fact operated by Canadian carrier Sunwing. Plane clean and tidy with seats that were more than adequate for the 4hr flight to Rhodes. Staff friendly enough, and stewardesses were British, but flight crew Canadian. Only two gripes, firstly, why do the airline try to get you to check in on line when, upon arriving at both departure airports, you are made to stand in a long queue with those who'd not checked in online? Complete waste of my time. And secondly (and TUI are by no means the only offenders) why did they have no food for purchase on the return leg? It is not rocket science to calculate that on a long-ish flight like that that passengers will want something to eat in both directions, so for goodness sake order enough from the caterers for BOTH legs of the flight. From TUI's point of view it makes sense as they missed out on making a fat profit on sandwiches etc they could have sold ! Otherwise, a decent product in the leisure market.

### "told they had now closed the flight"
Gatwick to Las Palmas. The customer experience made Ryanair look like a 5 star airline. Recently tried to fly with TUI to take my partner on holiday and get engaged. Unable to check in online for an unknown reason. Arrived at the airport check in area later than planned due to traffic, but on time according to the terms and conditions on the ticket. I was concerned about the length of the queue so sought assistance from a member of staff in Tui branding at the self check in desks, explained the situation and she checked flight times etc and told me we had plenty of time and to queue. After queuing I was told they had now closed the flight (while we were queuing) and we couldn’t board. I then had to run around the airport to find another flight. TUI’s customer services teams response, computer says no issues (effectively we can’t be bothered to investigate because we don’t want to have to compensate you) and the airport staff don’t work for us so we do my care (despite then wearing our branding). We flew with Tui on the return flight so I can review the flight experience which was nothing special.

### "facilities and food were atrocious"
Flew London Gatwick to Cancun. TUI should stick to short haul - they obviously have no experience of managing long haul. Apart from messing up our extra legroom seats, we then had to pay to 'downgrade' to get seats together. This was an 8-10 hour flight, but the facilities and food were atrocious - the cheapest, disposable, plastic earphones were totally unsuited to listening to a film - we both gave up. The quality of food served was on a par with airline food 30 year's ago - plastic chicken served going out and same on return. There are absolutely no frills whatsoever despite high prices. There is no comparison with recognised long haul carriers such as Virgin, Emirates, BA etc. This is short haul behaviour at long haul costs, with the added issue of paying to sit together (a Ryanair Scam). Dreamliner? Nightmare liner would be more apt.

### "Cabin crew were friendly"
Excellent flight with TUI on the Dreamliner between London Gatwick and Barbados. Check-in was a breeze and queue not very long. Boarding was done by rows, which seemed to help with congestion. Seats were leater, which were ok for the flight duration, seat back screen clear and had the latest films and entertainment. Cabin crew were friendly and always on hand to get a new drink or answer any questions. Two hot meals provided on this 8 hours flight, one large and one small, which was nearly the same as what we received with BA on a 13 hours flight! Impressive! Captains were great and very informative, it was also nice having them come on the PA mid-way during the flight to provide an update on the conditions and how we were progressing, which doesn't happen that often any more on these flights. I would have no hesitation in flying TUI again.

### "excellence of her performance"
Stansted to Las Palmas. On January 29th I sustained an injury to my leg 5 minutes before boarding the aircraft caused by a rack of 3 wheelchairs striking my shin heavily as it was pushed away from the aircraft door along the narrow passageway by a Stansted employee. I was seated in an opposing wheelchair using assistance provided by the airport. On impact which caused me to cry out with pain and and the staff did nothing and continued on her way. On entering the cabin with great difficulty the Cabin Manager assessed the situation and seated me in the first available seat and applied a pack of ice to the injury. She carried out first aid throughout the flight raising my leg and applying ice and compression also as she could see I was somewhat shocked. Her care was exemplary and greatly reduced the bruising and severity of the injury. I didn’t secure her surname but I wish you to note the excellence of her performance. Consequently I have minimal swelling and bruising and discomfort so am able to continue my holiday. Many thanks to her!

### "a really good airline"
Departure Airport - Firstly, an overview of the airport. We were checked in for our flight so quickly as we were called to an empty lane at CMF (their queues work differently there!). The staff were chatty and friendly. You are advised to go through security once called as there is not much on the other side. The queue was a bit long but we got moving within half an hour. After boarding, we had 20 minutes to relax until pushback. THE FLIGHT took off, and it was only five minutes late - rare that a TUI flight I go on is on time. The cabin service soon followed, but the rear trolley had to return to the galley as we had a lot of turbulence for the first half an hour. We descended and that turbulence went. The back trolley was back in service and we ordered our food. Unfortunately, they only had a bacon baguette or a ham and cheese toastie - in small numbers. Luckily, we were able to get two bacon baguettes. They were yummy, but a bit expensive. After that, there were final checks for the descent into Manchester. We were served well by the crew. Arrival Airport - We landed nice and punctual, but a little bottleneck happened as it said 'All bags will be delivered before 14.50'. Well, a little lie there as I only had one of my three bags by 14.50! The belt stopped and started again and we finally got all our bags around half an hour later. All in all, a really good airline, would fly again, but side note: they removed the seatback pockets and made this little storage area behind the tray table (when you see the photo below, you'll understand what I mean), where they put all the magazines and safety card.

### "premium economy was comfortable"
Barbados to Birmingham via Gatwick. Absolute chaos in both Barbados airport and onboard plane. In the airport terminal the flight was displayed as going to Bournemouth with the BHX flight number. We were advised the plane was taking some passengers for Gatwick due to operational reasons once on board. The staff on board did not appear to know how many passengers and two were also in accounted for. Hence nearly 3 hour delay. The accommodation in premium economy was comfortable and food and drink was good. The pilot did warn us to expect turbulence due to weather conditions. We needed to fasten our seatbelts for a good proportion of the journey. The Boeing 787 is comfortable with lots of overhead storage space but not enough toilets. When the cabin crew were advised -prepare for landing we appeared to be circling round for some time when the captain announced we were unable to land due to snow and closure of BHX. He needed to communicate regarding where was safe to land. We eventually landed at LGW some 3hours after original ETA. I appreciate we landed safely and of course am grateful for this. However upon landing we had to collect luggage clear customs and were given a £5 refreshment voucher which we barely had time to use before being herded on to coaches back to BHX. We left between 08:30 and 09:00. Conditions on road were extremely hazardous in snow. The journey took 10 hours and we eventually arrived back at BHX some 14 hours after original estimated time of arrival. As a result I lost my paid for taxi and had to stay in a hotel overnight prior to completing my journey home. Had chaos not ensued at the beginning of our journey we may have landed on time prior to closure of BHX
