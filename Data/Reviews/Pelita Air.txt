### "absolutely breezy and easy"
Yogyakarta to Jakarta onboard IP245. Check-in was absolutely breezy and easy, and having purchased some extra baggage allowance, they didn't overcharge me for being a bit overweight; it only cost me around $5 for a 5kg extra allowance. Departure was pretty much on time, and the flight attendants were friendly right from the start. This time, I got their first Airbus A320 on the fleet, featuring Recaro BL3520 seats which had just gotten its cushion changed. The new cushion looked and felt comfortable, and my seat was user-friendly and full of features, combined with the slimline nature of the seats which left me with 29-30 inches legroom instead of 28 inches. The cabin, despite being old, looked well-maintained, adequately air-conditioned, and spacious. Take-off was only a few minutes late, and once airborne, the IFE kicked in. Pelita has just recently changed their IFE system from Starlight to Pasflix, which for me, looked like they just cloned the Starlight interface that was built via Tripper to their own app. That being said, due to the Wi-Fi speed, some of the contents failed to load properly, but for me, it just didn't matter on a short 45-minute flight. The meal was significantly better than my previous flight, with no more sticky jam distorting my tastebuds. Landing was early, and my bag arrived without too much of a wait. The ground experience at both CGK and YIA was superb. Sometimes with flights like this, I forget that they are a new, rejuvenated airline because their new, rejuvenated energy made me love them. As its name suggests, they're truly a shining light in the Indonesian aviation industry; apart from the slow IFE, they gave me no reason to hate them.

### "they were very impressive"
Jakarta to Yogyakarta. This is a new airline created less than 5 years ago to compete with the huge amount of Indonesian carriers. This was my first Pelita Air flight and they made me love them in first sight. The check-in experience was very fast and the agent took his time to work quickly and also accurately at the same time. Boarding was done through a bus gate, and despite using a second-hand aircraft from GoAir, the cabin was kept clean, comfortable, and in a pristine condition. It was also perfectly air-conditioned. The seat used was a slimline seat still original from GoAir, which was comfortable, had a lot of cushion, easy to use, and had a decent amount of legroom for a short hop like this. The slimline nature of the seat added a considerable extra inch. Take-off was done slightly late, and soon after, the snack and drink service kicked in. A bread and a bottle of water was served, and so was a taro bread. The texture was a little rough and sticky for my liking, but it was delicious. There was also a Wi-Fi based in-flight entertainment which utilized the same system used by Lion Air group. It had slightly less contents compared to the ones in Batik Air, but with the same wonderful layout and blazing fast speed. The cabin crews of this flight could be just a little more friendlier, but they were overall very nice, attentive, professional, and courteous, and even went as far as asking how my first flight with Pelita was. Landing was 5 minutes ahead of schedule. Overall, for a new airline, they were very impressive; and that's not an easy thing to say since I have also tried some new airlines nowadays and they have raised the bar high, too. Pelita seemed to be a very nice alternative to fly around Indonesia, and they have definitely met my expectations despite my expectations being high.

### "light snack and water provided"
My recent trip from Jakarta to Denpasar with Pelita Air was an absolute pleasure! Both departure and arrival adhered to the schedule. The  seat pitch in their aircraft offers  ample legroom, Every seat has a USB port and an AC power outlet. A tasty light snack and water were provided, which was perfect for the short flight duration. Departure from Jakarta's Terminal 3 was offers a bright, airy ambiance and a good selection of shops and restaurants for pre-flight browsing. Smooth Transfers: Even for a far gate, a bus was available to take passengers to the aircraft. The cabin crew were professional and courteous. Pelita Air provided Wi-Fi access to their Inflight Entertainment (IFE) system that allowed me to stream movies, shows, or music on my device, making the flight even more enjoyable. A Minor Room for Improvement: While the ground staff were generally helpful, there were a few instances where they seemed a bit inattentive. Perhaps some additional training could improve their overall efficiency..
