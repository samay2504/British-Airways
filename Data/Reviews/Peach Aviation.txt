### "anything above 7kgs as carry on"
It’s literally impossible to make them understand that you need to carry anything above 7kgs as carry on. They humiliated us because the hand luggage was 8kgs. Surprisingly enough, the overhead compartments were almost empty. Outrageous experience.

### "limitations of carry ons is arcane"
Worse than spirit. The lines are insane. The limitations of carry ons is arcane. I would not fly this airline if someone was dying and it was the only option to get there in time. The flight was delayed.

### “Nothing to complain about”
First and second times flying Peach, return trip from Narita to Sapporo, and both were: 1. on time; 2. with polite crew on the ground and in the air; 3. speedy check-in process; 4. clear instructions about the 7 kg limit; 5. fast luggage delivery. Nothing to complain about except the fact that they do not accept credit cards on board the plane, so we could not try the signature peach juice, and no wifi or any kind of entertainment - luckily the flights were short, so it was not a big problem. Very good experience for us.

### "caused me big trouble"
Peach Aviation staff delayed issuing the boarding pass, I rushed to the boarding gate but the staff shut off the boarding gate in front of me and declared boarding is finished. Then the boarding staff made false promise to rebook ticket for me. When I asked the staff to rebook the ticket the staff denied the rebook ticket promise immediately and totally had no intention to provide any help and service. I stuck in the airport in the middle night. Peach Aviation caused me big trouble and huge financial loss.

### "very strict about the 7kg carryon"
Not Verified | Airline staff is very strict about the 7kg carryon and kept rechecking our weights and dimensions during checkin, even as we were just 0.5-1kg over it. Very negative and frustrating experience even before boarding the plane. You can barely carry anything with the 7kg limit - our near empty carryon suitcases alone are around at least 3-4kg. Being so strict about the carryon weight limit along with poor communication skills and empathy for customers is a surefire way to make sure we will never take Peach again.

### "Please don't take this airline"
Please don't take this airline, 1 hour before departure they just cancel the flight, it’s not make any sense. And they don’t provide anything. Please don’t choose this airline.

### "such a negative experience"
I had an extremely frustrating experience with Peach Aviation. Their carry-on weight limit of 7kg is ridiculously strict. My carry-on bag was already 3kg, and my leather purse, which is essential for me, weighed 2kg without any items in it. On top of that, I had my wallet (filled with Japanese coins), phone, passport, and medication, bringing my total to 7.65kg. They insisted I repack, but my checked bag was already at its limit, leaving me with no option. It's frustrating that they wouldn't make an exception for just 0.65kg over. Additionally, the staff was unprofessional and had difficulty communicating in English. To make matters worse, the flight was delayed, and the seats were uncomfortable. It's disheartening to have such a negative experience, especially when traveling should be stress-free and enjoyable. Peach Aviation needs to seriously reconsider their policies and improve their customer service

### "luggage exceeded the total size by 5cm"
We flew from Tokyo to Sapporo and the baggage size/allowance was absurd. One of my carry on luggage exceeded the total size by 5cm due to a slightly elongated handle and the service crew didnt allow it and insisted to be checked in with additional cost. The manager came by and initially said ok to bring on board but the service attendant kept insisting I needed to pay for check in. I eventually gave in and paid the 10k Yen but really, just a 5 cm at that cost? I have never encountered a worse airline than this.

### "chose to wait for 4 passengers running late"
They chose to wait for 4 passengers who were running late for 40 mins and delayed everyone else who was on time for the flight. How ridiculous is that? If your passengers don’t show up, you say no show and take their bags on and take off with the people who are on time! The people were clearly just caught up shopping. I put 1 star as at least plane was clean.

### "did not want me to get on the plane with that"
The boarding time started 10 mn before the flight. The customers of 3 different planes at almost same time departure were passing the security and I got through while the boarding time already started. I had my mountain crampons in my carry on luggage. They did not want me to get on the plane with that (I can understand), make me wait more than 5 minutes before to get me out and did not help me too find a solution. No one moved. I missed the flight because of their incapacity of reaction. I was not refund neither offered to get in another one. My way back, was also no refund. The staff did not care more especially after having checking that I took a basic plan. It is not cheap as it seems according the mess at the boarding time, the non professionalism of their employees. I am still chocked that they make me lose 12,120 JPY and that it is just about the flight itself (to be add transportation in/out airport, hotel reservation, sadness to see all my plans crushed). And that with a bit more of reaction they will have guide me to a locker asap and meme my travel possible.

### "pay for baggage that I had already paid for"
Awful experience. Late, small seats and when I checked in I was told I had to pay for baggage that I had already paid for. Reason was that I changed my flight and apparently paid for baggage doesn’t carry over.

### "Would not refund me"
Not Verified | Would not refund me during COVID-19 epidemic. A few weeks ago, I was going to cancel my flight due to the COVID virus that's hitting NYC (Which is where I'm from,) obviously flights got cancelled, and just a few weeks ago, I was able to cancel my flight from the page but I only didn't just to wait it out to see if they would cancel it themselves. Now, the cancellation page isn't working, and they refused to refund me. Their policy says you can cancel for a refund with a fee. Now I can't even cancel at ALL, the page literally doesn't go to the cancellation page anymore.

### "caused me some serious concern"
Okinawa to Hong Kong. In general, this little budget airline get you from A to B, serve is ok and menu offer is nice and not too expensive at all. However, the low rating concerns their safety standards. There were three things that happened during the outbound and inbound flights that caused me some serious concern. When landing in Naha airport at night I was shocked that the cabin light was not dimmed. Usually in exit rows, for safety reasons, people with disabilities, mother with infants are NOT allowed. Yet with Peach, a mother was allowed to sit there holding her baby, and no infant seat belt was even provided. Landing back into Hong Kong, a few people didn't put their window shades back up, and the crew didn't care, she was more concerned about where they put their bags. Tried to contact them via email, there is actually no email address to writer to them. I do like this little airline which offer very cheap tickets to Japan, but their standards leave me wondering.

### "5 minutes late for check-in"
Okinawa to Tokyo. Me and my friend were 5 minutes late for check-in and they don’t let us in, telling that there can’t be refund and we have no other options and forget our money, our travel plan.

### "we were unable to board"
Tokyo Haneda to Seoul Incheon. We came 3 hours early for check in to be told that they could not fly us in as transit passengers and there was no e-visa or visa on arrival at Incheon, Seoul. This meant that we were unable to board nor get a refund and we could not make the onward connecting flights.

### "know nothing about student visa"
Sapporo to Taipei. I’m disappointed that the staff seems like know nothing about student visa. They were questioning my visa, when I have Japanese resident card! Can I even become a student in japan if my visa is invalid? They keep opening their manual book, calling the other staff just to make sure my visa is valid. I showed them my resident card but they still wanted visa sticker, stating that I will stay for X years. That is written in my resident card.

### "does a good job"
Osaka to Hong Kong. I have flown Peach several times now. It is a low cost airline, but it does a good job. Ground and cabin staff are nice, the seats are not particularly comfortable and have small legroom space, but overall not too bad. For the price, it is definitely ok. This flight was on time, the ground staff at check-in was kind and gave me an emergency exit seat (lots of legroom, usually need to pay). The cabin attendant I spoke with went the extra mile to make sure I could buy the only sandwich left without meat.

### "Terrible customer service"
Tokyo to Seoul. Terrible customer service, not worth the cheap price. Next time, I'd rather pay extra money to fly with a reliable airline that offers better service and quality.

### "cancelled because of a typhoon"
One of the worst airlines. The flight from Ishigaki to Tokyo on 11th August was cancelled because of a typhoon, we tried to contact the company but nobody answered the calls and there is noway to have any news. We kept trying for the next day but nothing, ghost company with no customer service. After many tries my friend arrived to be in contact with someone and he has been told that there is no refund, not even in miles.

### "improve your carry-on policy"
Tokyo to Osaka. Peach Aviation have to improve your carry-on policy. I can understand if you have security issues that large objects would be an obstruction to go on full flights as carry-on but my object was a fragile guitar and the flight was half full. There was plenty of overhead locker space. Instead of telling the customer the size rules Peach Aviation would be more customer friendly in an agreement on negotiating a reasonable carry-on solution for guitars like most European airlines do.

### "generally good management"
Osaka to Hong Kong. I have flown with Peach for 3 times on the same route (Hong Kong Osaka). Comparing with other LCC my other Hong Kong friends use, I would say Peach provides comparable prices nd services. Of the 3 times I flew with Peach, 2 returning flights from Osaka were delayed for an hour, both due to airspace control of mainland China. Since many passengers carried several bags as handcarry items, Peach limited the number to 2 handcarry items per passengers, and there appeared to be less chaos in the overhead compartment now. Though poor backpackers like me prefers grabbing a bottle of green tea from the vending machine before boarding, drinks can be purchased on flight with cash (Japanese yen). Seat pitch is just as ridiculous as the other LCC. For the price of approximately one bento, you can upgrade to the exit rows, so your knees won't be poking the back of the previous passenger :) You cannot change seats while onboard the flight. The airline loses some revenue with this stubborness, but this certainly ensures order when the seats were already so crowded. I also appreciate that Peach has its announcements in Cantonese too, as its crew speaks mainly Japanese and English. Being a poor backpacker, I will still choose Peach over other LCCs, with generally good management and similar price points.

### "worst customer service"
Osaka to Tokyo. Travelling Peach Airlines was terrible - not the flight - just the check in. In 30 years of flying airlines around the world, I have never been so humiliated and embarrassed because of the terrible way I was treated at Peach Aviation check in. Flight MM315 at 14:30 - Osaka to Tokyo. I only had 8 kg check in luggage and had paid for 20 kg. However the completely inflexible check in staff made me go to the side and tie my pillow in a little back pack, a small back pack and trolly together to make it one item as she said I paid for one item - I had paid for 20 kg and the weight of my check-in luggage was just 8 KG. Then she started on my hand luggage and made me take everything out of my front waist band and put it in my pockets like my wallet and passport - then my phone and camera had to go in my pockets - all in all to make my hand luggage 7 kg. What is the difference if it is in my purse, hand luggage or pocket as it all goes on board with me. After I went through all that humiliation and embarrassment and experienced the worst customer service I have ever experienced at Check In I walk around the corner and there is another Peach vulture employee there wanting to weigh my hand luggage - so that is twice I went through it Peach Aviation rude and horrible check in. I will never fly Peach Aviation ever again.

### "Completely uncomfortable"
Fukuoka to Tokyo. Completely uncomfortable and full stupidity of the crew. Seat are so small I couldn't fit and I'm 190cm / 6ft 2. Could not sleep, could not work, could not eat. I asked to move to an exit row seat since there were 3 empty ones 3 rows before, but no. The stupidity of the flight attendants and their alienation to rules are stronger than common sense. I had to seat for 2 hours with my back completely twisted and my knees bothering my left neighbors.

### "double pay to check in"
New Chitose to Osaka. Went to add snow board baggage on the website, only had check in bags so I paid for all my bags. Get to the counter at the airport to be told that the snowboard bag could only be paid at the counter and that they weren’t going to put the money I already spent on the bag towards the snowboard which on their website doesn’t state anything about this. (maybe in the fine print), so I had to double pay to check in my snowboard bag. To add to this weight was only 20kgs when did that ever be a thing with sport equipment. To top it fly was late, stay away from budget airlines - ends up costing more then business class with a reputable airline.

### "Gave me a lot of attitude"
Okinawa to Taipei. I checked in at the counter and they charged me for extra luggage. I paid, then the check in staff tells me that I will not be able to board the flight due to a technicality. I asked for a refund on my luggage. I was told to contact the airline. I did. They argued with me. Gave me a lot of attitude. Finally the informed me that they would issue a refund for the luggage charge in the next 4 months. They told me that they are unable to confirm my refund by email.

### "decreased the carry on weight"
Tokyo to Shanghai. They decreased the carry on weight from 10kgs to 7kgs and then raised the checked baggage rates by 300% to 6,800 yen per bag. I had booked the flight several months in advance but with these retroactive charges, I could have flown a normal airline in the daytime instead of an inconvenient red-eye. Also, this is the only airline that boards window seat passengers first which results in chaos. These folks don't have a clue.

### "the best low-cost airline"
Seoul to Tokyo. This is the best low-cost airline I have flown. They have a free allowance of a personal item and bag on board as long as it is under 10kg. In reality you can take 2 bags with total weight under 10kg. Although from 28.10 this changes to 7kg. Flight was on time. Planes are new and clean. Japanese staff are the most polite and kind in the world. Seat pitch is low, but that's because most passengers are small, but the seats recline. If you are a big person, I don't recommend flying with them, otherwise they are the best in terms of value for money.

### "is beyond disappointing"
Osaka to Hong Kong. This airline is beyond disappointing. I would recommend paying the extra bit to fly with a better airline, as at the end of the day, you really are not saving anything. When booking your flight, make sure you understand what is included. I had to pay 3750 Yen to check one luggage in at the airport. (Checked luggage allowance is zero). During the flight I was offered a bottle of water. I took a sip and the flight attendant came back and took it away. She said that my flight purchase does not include any drinks or snacks, and I don’t have to option to purchase it. Conclusion, a four hour flight with no water or snacks and no option to purchase any. If I could give it a negative rating, I would, because it’s not even worth a fraction of a star.

### "happy flying with Peach"
Outbound flight from Hong Kong to Osaka MM068 scheduled at 1:25am. Arrived at KIX on time. Inbound flight from Osaka to Hong Kong MM067 scheduled at 9pm, delayed for 50 minutes. I took the same inbound flight in July 2017 and it was delayed for the same amount of time too, so I was prepared for possible delay this time. I had the Peach homepage opened with my mobile phone, so I could eat my bento in peace while waiting to board the plane and being able to check real-time updates of flight information. After touching ground in Hong Kong, I got the taxi calling numbers ready, so I could book one while waiting for my luggage. I also bought travel insurance before my trip, so I know that I would be compensated in case flights were delayed or cancelled. Given how I was prepared for all possible situations, I was happy flying with Peach as a LLC. Compared to my Peach flight in July 2017, I found that the announcements on board improved. E.g. Passengers were told about coming turbulence and advised to use the toilet before the turbulence. Pre-recorded announcements were made in both English and Cantonese. I was happy that Peach did not allow passengers to change seats, for security and safety reasons given many mainland Chinese tourists were on board. Both inbound and outbound flights were fully booked, seats were cramped as expected. Some passengers sneezed and coughed freely in the crowded cabin, so it might worth upgrading your seat to get some extra space and avoid getting the flu. I noticed that the Japanese passengers put on a mask once they got on board.

### "the aircraft was clean and new"
Flew Peach Aviation from Bangkok to Okinawa. Check in on both outward and return legs was very efficient and the aircraft was clean and new. Seat pitch, as expected for an LCC, was rather tight. Service from both aircrew and cabin crew was excellent: safety was emphasised throughout. This flight has no inflight entertainment. Food sold for purchase on board was very tasty. The return flight was on time: the outbound flight had a two hour delay but this was not caused by Peach as the aircraft was in Bangkok ready for departure on time. Air Traffic Control in China closed their airspace due to overload on the last day of return from Lunar New Year. The pilot came personally to the boarding area to explain the issue and inform that he had obtained a new route via Philippines air space, saving a greater delay. A free meal on board was provided.

### "This is the worst airline"
Bangkok to Okinawa. Our flight was delayed 11 hours from departure time. We slept on the floor. Only got one bottle of water and one rice ball. No other support from the airline. We have tried to contact them through email, live chat, AI and facebook but couldn’t reach them .We need the official letter to claim the travel insurance. This is the worst airline!

### "one of the worst airlines"
Kansai to Hong Kong. Peach delayed our flight for 2 hours. When that time was reached they delayed it again for another 2 hours. The agent says they did not know when the plane would arrive to Kansai because something was broken. If they did not know when the plane was going to depart I could have taken another airline and flown out to my meeting. Now I have no choice but to take this flight miss my meeting which has cost me. I will never travel this airline again because they do not want you to go to another airline. They had chances to tell us and they chose to say it was only a 2 hour delay when they did not even know when or if the plane was going to arrive at Kansai airport. We received no food vouchers or compensation as well. Overall one of the worst airlines and I would never recommend or tell people to travel. Many of their planes have broken items, other planes are delayed as well for broken parts.

### "perfectly reasonable service, cabin and price"
Flew Seoul to Okinawa last week for summer vacation with friends. For the short hop to Japan, Peach is perfectly reasonable in terms of service, cabin and price. As it's an LCC, there is an inherent understanding that you will be getting a simple experience. Yes, Okinawa terminal is a separate building by bus that is extremely bare bones. It is a part of the cargo area you must reach by bus from Domestic Terminal. As such, don't go there too early before your flight (there are only two airlines and flights staggered throughout the day, so it is never clogged). There is no shopping or cafe. Just a gate, some seats and a bathroom. As there were no irregular operations, there was no real ground service. I always do expect some delay with departure as they set the turn around time for flights very tight. The plane was clean. I always pre book an exit row so that I can check in late at the airport and not worry about where I sit. I would happily fly Peach again.

### "experience was deplorable"
Yes Peach is a budget airline but this experience from Osaka to Shanghai was still deplorable. First they check in only a flight at a time, so don't bother being there too early as you will just wait. Then check in itself is nightmare as staff apply carry on rules more strict than their published rules. Anyway, the main issue is they have no supervisor, no feedback collection or contacting system.

### "unacceptable from staff"
Unacceptable behavior from Peach ground and cabin staff who despite the flight from Hong Kong to Okinawa not being fully booked assigned us different seats. Once boarded, we realized that my fiancée had two free seats next to her and asked if I could be seated next to her. The staff prohibited us to be seating next to each other and showed no flexibility whatsoever despite no one sitting in that row.

### "a pleasant flight on Peach"
Kansai to Fukuoka all turned out to go quite smooth for me this time round. I'm guessing it's a hit or miss for everyone and this was a hit for me. Peach Aviation is a low cost carrier, and for the price I've paid it was definitely worth the value for the money. The  check in was very quick and efficient. Peach uses a self check in concept which means there's only booths available for you. You can check in earlier as long as you scan the bar code at the machine which produces a receipt which is actually your boarding pass. It takes quite a while to get to the aircraft at the Kansai Airport but overall the check in process was smooth and efficient. The flight was a short and nice one. The seats were comfortable with decent leg room. My only problem was that the sound of the engine was a little too loud but otherwise it's a pleasant flight on Peach. No delays and no cancellation.

### "no follow-up service"
Worst ever flight, never again. Just a few hours before taking-off for the flight from Shanghai to Tokyo, I was informed that my Peach flight was cancelled. Cancellation is not too rare during travel, but there was no follow-up service, nobody took care of us at all except of a note in the worst ever copying quality. We had to run in the airport near midnight to find out available flight, because we scheduled to join a travel group in Tokyo the next day. The result was that we paid five time of the price for the one-way tickets to be able to reach Tokyo. The next day after we arrived Japan I sent email to contact the company, because we was told we have to apply for refund within a limited time, also I had to get confirmation for booked return ticket, no response until I asked my travel guide to call there directly. Six days later when I left Japan, I still had not received my refund, but I had a chance to experience my return travel to see what the Peach like. This company used an independent boarding building in Osaka airport, there was a long way to reach the check-in gate through display desks of duty-free store without a directional sign, a long way to reach boarding gate, and a distance to reach the flight in the middle of airport. Inflight, I found that there was no entertainment equipment on the sear, I could feel the knees of the traveller behind me through the soft chair back, I heard some travellers shouting because of luggage issues. We were able to calm down when we finally returned to Shanghai. Even until now, I still can hardly believe how a business with such a quality of service could exist, I lost my money and my vacation fun.

### "No flights were cancelled"
Due to all the negative reviews, I was a bit nervous booking with Peach but booked anyway seeing as they were so much cheaper than any other airlines. In case you are uncertain about this company, here is a snap shot of our experience with Peach. My wife and I recently returned from a trip to Asia and booked three flights with them a couple months in advance: Osaka - Taipei, Taipei - Tokyo, and Tokyo - Seoul. No flights were cancelled and all left on time. Most of the reviews were accurate about being a bit cramped, one flight we couldn't sit beside each other and they didn't serve food or drinks without additional cost. At the same time paying that little for flights and seeing they are only 1-2hrs, it was a big deal for us. If you want to pay 2 to 3 times more for a flight go ahead but if you want a cheap flight from Japan to surround countries/cities, we highly recommend Peach.

### "one of the worst I have seen"
Osaka to Shanghai. They canceled our flight two times, without provide any acommodation or food. Last time they just gave us the chance of refund money, and the worst thing is the money will be in two months! Finally we had to buy tickets two times more expensive in another company, plus 5 days lost on our holiday. Customer sevice is one of the worst I have seen.

### "definitely fly with Peach again"
Taipei to Kansai return. I was a bit worried about flying with this airline after reading some bad reviews, but everything went very smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly, the airplane seats surprisingly comfortable (but very tight on legroom), and the tickets were good value for money. I would definitely fly with Peach again.

### "no information or customer service"
Peach is the worst airline we have travelled on. We had a flight scheduled from Naha to Osaka (Kansai) and then a booking with a separate airline from Osaka (Kansai) to Shanghai. When we arrived at Naha airport they announced that our flight would be over 3 hours delayed. This would cause us to miss our connecting flight. We contacted their contact center who informed us because the tickets were purchased separately there was nothing they could do. As a result we had to sleep overnight in Osaka (Kansai) airport since no hotel rooms were available and there were no flights leaving Osaka for Shanghai that night. We received no refund, no information or customer service. We received exceptional service and kindness during our visit to Japan from local restaurants, hotels and shops etc. However our experience with Peach is the worst we have had with any airline anywhere.

### "extremely short flight and worth the money"
Weekend getaway to Osaka. Extremely short flight and worth the money with cabin cleanliness and excellent crews. Our 8.40 pm flight departed late (usually does as it did in the past), so a front row seat prebooking is recommended. The airport is empty at this time upon arrival, but a front seat ensures no queue. We landed at 10.45 and made it to our bus at 11 with time to go to the bathroom, use the ATM and get some water. Any further behind and you wait another hour for the bus. On our return flight to Incheon, complimentary exit row seats were orovided at the check in counter (kiosk didn't complete check in) without even asking.

### "Peach is not a reliable airline"
Flight from Shanghai to Tokyo Haneda was cancelled by Peach only a couple of hours before departure. There was no information provided on further procedure until 2.5 hours before the planned departure, when Peach check-in counter finally opened. There is no way to contact Peach via phone, so you had to wait till then to get any information. Peach staff told the passengers that the flight was cancelled due to weather related issues and that there will be no rebooking or any assistance. Questions raised by some passengers why all the other flights of the departure and destination airport are perfectly in time were ignored. Everything they were able to say in an increasingly rude tone was basically: "we can't help you, leave us alone". They handed over a sheet of paper with information on how to get a money refund (of course flight only, no other expenses related to cancelation) or how to book an other Peach flight (next one in 24 hours). Since the information that Peach will not provide any other flight came very late (flight departure was 1:25 AM, and counter opened only about two hours before) there was only one flight to Tokyo left on the same day. Ironically by ANA, the mother of Peach Aviation. Needless to say that the around 500 USD they would have charged was way too much for everyone and all people had to book flights for the next day, which where still around double the price of the Peach refund. So far my experience with Peach. As a European I have quite some experience with low-cost carriers like Ryanair or EasyJet. I am perfectly aware that there is a difference to regular airlines regarding service and so on. That's the deal and that's how they can provide cheaper prices. Still the super short notice of the cancelation, the obvious lying about the reasons (even the staff admitted at some point that weather is not the reason but terms and conditions of Peach allow them to cancel for no reason, so it doesn't make a difference), and the total refusal to give any assistance on booking a new flight or compensate for the additional costs, was rather shocking for an airline from Japan (remember, this is the country where train staff is apologizing to every single passenger when a train runs late for a couple of minutes). Conclusion: In my experience Peach is not a reliable airline, and as reliability is the most important thing for an airline, I cannot recommend them at all.

### "onboard crew were lovely"
Osaka to Seoul. Check in staff were extremely unenthusiastic and so were the security staff, the departure lounge is small but just the right size and perfectly easy to navigate, wouldn't arrive extra early as you'd be bored. The A320 aircraft was well kept and not too in your face which budget cabins can be guilty of, the onboard crew were lovely. Would definitely use them again, much better than JetStar but not quite as good as Air Asia!

### "staff were despicably bad"
Okinawa to Tokyo Narita with Peach. Please don’t fly with this airline - I learned that when it goes wrong, it goes really wrong. My flight MM504 departure experienced mid air difficulties and we were forced to return to Okinawa. Very limited information on board (only in Japanese) and this led to many people with anxiety and stress. After our emergency landing in Okinawa, we were left with no information, no care, and no follow up at all. The flight was simply designated as “cancelled”. We received no assistance or explanation or help at all. Ground staff were despicably bad. None of them mastered a conversational level of English (for a tourist route like that) and no one cared at all. Even for a low-cost carrier it was shameful, dishonest and by far the worst I have ever seen. Unlike any other airline I have flown with, including many Japanese airlines, I normally am surprised by the efforts of the staff who will do everything it takes to get passengers to their destination. The Peach staff I spoke to were unknowledgeable about their own flights and schedule, unable to express themselves in English and simply unable to deal with simple requests / questions. I assumed, booking with a low-cost airline was a step down from the usual, but I was simply baffled on how bad and unprofessional the ground staff acted. Finally, when I found someone to rebook my flight, I was told by this staff member all flights were booked. Even if I wanted to fly Peach within 10 days, it was not possible, so I would have to book something else with another airline. I had to book a flight to Tokyo myself in the proper terminal. Missing my flight resulted in extra costs, which Peach will not reimburse me for. Do not accept “peach points”. I won’t need them as I will never fly with them again. Contacting the airline online or via email is even worse than in real life (how is that even possible in 2016?) Think no English speaking staff, long waits and recorded messages only in Japanese. I think this is deliberate to discourage complaints.

### "very tight and cramped"
Osaka to Hong Kong. We bought two tickets together, but we could not get two seats together when we tried several times at the auto-check-in machine. We were early enough so it wasn't possible that there were no more pair seats remaining. We asked a young Peach staff, he said you have to pay extra to guarantee seats together. We were amazed by this. We spoke to the duty manager, a nice lady, and she confirmed that auto-checkin assigns seats randomly. We told her we had bought tickets together and were now checking in together and we had never come across this situation before. She of course apologised, but confirmed that unfortunately we would have to pay extra for guaranteeing sitting together. Inside the aircraft was very tight and cramped.

### "will not fly Peach again"
Osaka to Okinawa. Never again I hope. Even at Osaka airport their gates are far away and seem remote and isolated. The flight crew were pleasant enough; there is the low amount of amenities and attention I've come to expect from an LCC. I never had any doubts about the safety of the flight, the plane seemed in new condition, and the crew very professional. But at arriving at Naha, Okinawa (on time), I became very frustrated with Peach. Once again, I soon found out, we were deposited into a far away terminal, but this one was even more remote than at Osaka; it felt like I was in a hot warehouse. After claiming my bag (of course I had to pay to check my 1 bag; at least Jeju Air lets you check a bag for free, and doesn't make you sweat and wait in some forgotten place), there was a long line to get outside. I had no idea what the line was for, why we were waiting, and why the line of people was not moving. There were no Peach employees anywhere to be seen. After about 10 minutes in line, I thought I saw a Peach employee walking by, going into an office door, so I attempted to call out to her - I am fairly certain she heard me, and made eye contact with me, but went through the door anyway and closed it behind her. A few more minutes passed, and I was able to find out from an employee of a rental car company that we were waiting in line for a shuttle bus to take us to the main terminal. I then noticed that there were indeed buses coming, but so infrequently, that it took at least 30 minutes of standing in the Peach warehouse (apparently no A/C, for it was Hot in there) before I (and most other passengers) were able to board their shuttle to the proper terminal, a 5 minute ride, packed full, still hot. I went on their website today, to make a complaint, and I could find nowhere any contact information for them (only ways to book a flight, take your $, and kiss you goodbye.) I will not fly Peach again.

### "impossible to contact Peach Airlines"
Tokyo to Sapporo with Peach. Never again. Due to heavy snow in Sapporo the plane had to return back to Tokyo. The passengers were informed that we could transfer at no extra cost to the next available Peach flight. The only problem was that the next available Peach flight to Sapporo was in 3 days which did not fit my travel plans. No other compensation was given. In order to get a refund it was necessary to submit a refund application form on line within 10 days. I tried several times to fill in the form on line but it was rejected each time. I therefore did the following in order to try to solve the problem. - I called Peach Contact Center a number of times Nobody answered the phone - in spite of waiting more than 30 minutes each time. - I tried to find a mail address for Peach Airlines in order to make contact No mail address available - I went in person to Peach Airlines at Narita to get a mail address I could contact They could nor find such an address either. Nor could they contact Peach Contact Center for me. In short - it is impossible to contact Peach Airlines. Reading other customers' reviews I now realise this is a common complaint. I have still not got my refund, and will of course not use or recommend this airlines.

### "meets all the expectations"
Flew from Osaka to Hong Kong with Peach Aviation. Peach meets all the expectations of a low cost carrier and exceeds some of them. Check in was very simple and straightforward. It only took a few minutes and was totally automated. Staff on board were friendly and efficient and the food and drink was reasonably priced. Seats were comfortable. For short haul flights like this the lack of inflight entertainment isnt really a problem, just bring a good book or your ipad and youre all set. Overall, I highly recommend Peach and will use them again next time I go to Hong Kong

### "basics provided more than enough"
Fukuoka to Okinawa with Peach. Smooth Check-in and bag drop, the shuttle to the LCC Airline terminal was frequent and efficient. The flight was short so I found that the basics that the aircraft provided were more than enough. Japan's first LCC was incredibly lovely and would fly with them again for my flights within Japan and to and from Korea

### "Keep hiring great people"
I was ready to write a very nasty review after my horrible experience trying to phone them to change a minor booking error. They updated their website using a new system, and all of our birthdates were bumped up one day, even though I entered them correctly. For example, a birthdate of August 1 was into their new system as August 2. If this situation was not resolved, I would be really stressed out before arriving at the airport, because it was highly likely that we would probably wouldn't be able to board. If you enter one wrong button on the phone, ex. press 1 for changing your booking, then they hang up on you. It costs me .75 cents a minute, so after the fourth time it gets really frustrating and annoying. I purchased a $10 international calling card after this, and I got hung up on another four times until I finally got through. I got through by pressing 1 for changing your booking, then 6 for changing the # of passengers, then 1 for having your booking # ready, and you should be able to get through unless I missed a step (sorry). If it doesn't work, just make sure you press something that's like a big change like a cancellation/refund, changing itinerary for 1 person in a group itinerary, upgrading to premier, etc. and you will get through! However, I received such great customer service from a lady on the phone that I am really happy that I booked with them. Honestly, I was stunned and amazed when I received someone on the other line who was so accommodating, respectful, and apologetic for the issues I was having on the website. I really wasn't expecting this after I read about the horrible experiences on multiple outlets. Feel bad that I don't remember the agent's name, but thank you! Keep hiring great people, Peach.

### "no information and no apologies"
I flew Peach aviation for a round-trip from Seoul to Okinawa with my girlfriend and baby girl. As we planned this family vacation quite late they were the only tickets left for that journey at that time and were not particularly cheap. As you can expect from a low-cost airline, we had to pay extra to check-in our luggage (I recommend doing it online before departure as it is cheaper) and had to pay for everything onboard. However we were very disappointed to see that there was no particular services offered to families with babies at all. During the onward journey from Seoul Incheon to Naha, the flight was delayed by one hour. Fortunately it is a rather big airport with lots of things to do and we were therefore not bothered by the wait although we were always rushed to go to the gate. On the other hand, the outward journey was something else. When we got to Naha international terminal, we couldn't find the Peach counter, we were then told by security that they operate from another terminal and that we had to take a shuttle bus. This extends considerably the time you need to go to their counters. Turns out the Peach "terminal" is a cargo hall in the cargo area which is why only their buses can go in (taxis and private cars are not allowed in there). As we got there we find out our flight was delayed by 15 min but we were still rushed to go to the gates. When we got to the gate, we were told the flight was actually 40 min delayed and after those 40 min that we had to wait another hour. Overall the flight left with more than 2.30h delay (for a 2.25h flight). Unfortunately the waiting was unbearable. Because of the cargo hall situation the only shop inside was a tiny souvenir shop with no food and no drink which makes it very difficult when you have a hungry and thirsty baby. What makes it worse is that Peach staff were completely useless. Only one out of four spoke some English (which is unbelievable when only 5% of their passengers on that route are Japanese) and they refused to answer any question regarding the delay and the reason. When we asked for someone in charge they just wouldn't answer and just left us clueless. There was absolutely no announcement about the progress, no information and no apologies. All passengers were simply left in the dark with nothing to do, nothing to eat and nothing to drink. I advise any future buyers to be careful. I will never fly them again.

### "staff polite and pleasant"
Tokyo Narita to Osaka. Peach Aviation is a good budget airline, compared to some others used before. Easy to use self check in service at Tokyo airport. Flight left on time, cabin staff were polite and pleasant. The plane was clean, and seats were comfortable with a fair amount of leg room. One of the better, if not best budget airline I have travelled with.

### "definitely not recommend them"
We flew Peach Aviation from HKG-KIX in late September and would definitely not recommend them. Even for a low cost company, they are not worth the bother though they are quite cheap. I have and never had such a bad experience. There is no web check in, which is a nonsense. To make matters worse, check-in at HKG airport opened very late. (Check-in at KIX was a joke). Boarding was a nightmare. Peach staff didn't even try to organize the queue. Not even sure if there was any staff at all, in fact. Seats are cramped, even for a LCC. Seat pitch is 29" and my traveling partner's legs just did not fit (he's 6" tall). Bearable for 3 hours, but unpleasant. Terminal 2 in KIX is a glorified hangar. It's clean, though, and there is free WiFi, as well a 7-11 for food. Other LCCs use Terminal 1, which is much more convenient. Outbound flight (HKG-KIX) was delayed by 45-50 minutes. Not unexpected for an evening flight on a LCC, but there was no announcement, no information, nothing. Not even an apology. Peach staff was conspicuously absent. Inbound flight back to HKG was cancelled due to Mujigae typhoon. No other airline cancelled KIX-HKG flights, though most were understandably delayed. But Peach just didn't want to bother, so they cancelled the flight outright at the last minute (50 min before the flight! ), after keeping passengers in the dark for 1.5 hours. Peach staff was polite but completely useless, and seemed as clueless as the passengers. Again, there was no apology. No explanation at all in English (thankfully I speak Japanese, and could translate for other passengers). We were told to either queue up for 1 or 2 hours until they could rebook us onto other flights (probably the next day, or the day after, with no accommodation or compensation, naturally) or to fend for ourselves and ask for a refund later. Considering Peach's incompetence and total disregard for their customers, we chose the latter option, and managed to book at seat last minute on the afternoon HK Express flight, which got us safely home (and which, while a LCC, had competent staff and kept us informed of delays). Overall, the lesson is, you get what you pay for? We paid peanuts and got monkeys. Buyer beware! Personally, I'll take my business elsewhere and pay a bit more for a better LCC (HK Express performed admirably) or bite the bullet and use a normal company.

### "terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service with Peach! Arrived to the airport over an hour before the flight and no signs showing where the Peach counter was. Had to ask security to find the bus/shuttle to take us to the terminal that was 15 minutes away in a strange warehouse set up. Once at the counter, we still had 30 mins before our flight but were unable to check in because check ins must be made 50 mins before the flight. Even though we had one carry on each and no checked bags, the staff would not work with us at all to make the flight. No refund or flight transfer funds were offered. We even tried to fly to Osaka instead but by the time we asked we were only 48 minutes before the next flight and were unable to check in. We asked for the supervisor and were first told no, then told he wouldn't be there until after an hour. And by the way, in the thirty minutes we tried to talk to the representatives, over 3 other groups of four people were turned away at the counter as well for not making the 50 minute check in window. Peach clearly sells cheap tickets and banks on the fact that people will not make the flight in time to check in. Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Be warned.

### Peach Aviation customer review
Terrible customer service - there is no email contact, no phone number answered by a human being. My son's flight was cancelled about 7 weeks ago due to a typhoon, which is totally understandable - but after 7 weeks, there has been no contact from Peach, no refund  and you can never get hold of anyone in Hong Kong to speak to.

### Peach Aviation customer review
I have traveled 6 times in the last 5 years with Peach, every time the quality is lower. My last flight with them will probably be the last. The cost is no longer that competitive, only a few thousand yen compared with main airlines (JAL, ANA, etc) when you add all the extra costs like luggage, booking fees. The cabin hasn't been renovated, looks like it is the same for the 5 last years, the carpets are worn, there are scratches on the seats. If you are over 1m 85, your legs do not fit in the the standard seats. During my last flight, all seats on exit rows where empty, I asked the attendant if I can move to one of the these seats, she refused. Then before take off she asked me not to put my legs in the aisle as it blocks the way. I asked then again to be moved to exit row where I won't bother anyone - refused again. Once we were airborne she came to explained me she followed her instructions: exit rows can be bought with extra fees on the ground, so next time I fly with Peach, I can book it. Smart marketing strategy, unfortunately because of these kind of greedy attitude there won't be a next time.

### Peach Aviation customer review
My flight was cancelled for family of 6 on return flight from Okinawa to Hong Kong. The flight was okay, a budget airline low of staff whatever. However, no update on flight status on website until we got to airport. At the airport, all the flights from Peach were cancelled. A mass of people lining up to rebook, no compensation for other costs incurred, hotel or other airline. Opted for refund, but it is almost a month now yet no refund - I called the "contact line" but only directs you to website and no live agent. Check website and no other way to contact. I tried refund on webpage but says no booking found. Overall if all goes well, you are ok. But if they cancel your flight, all hell breaks loose and you may still deal with refund issue months after. I rather pay more at a better company.

### Peach Aviation customer review
Well it's a budget airline, so you don't expect things to be like a full cost one. But these days the standard is lifting. I recently flown Jetstar Japan and Peach. The issue with Peach is customer service and on ground services at the airport. I'm writing this as I sit in a converted cargo shed in the Naha freight terminal. Waiting to board a flight that is already late. That is after the most confusing and messed up check in. Peach are strict about checked bags. One peice per person. Due to an extra bag and some odd weight limit per person policy combined carry on and checked, which I have not seen with other carriers, we ended up doing a repack on the floor at the check in. Due to language issues I mistakenly left a knife I purchased in Japan in a bag that was intended to be checked but became a carry on at the last minute. Ok that's my fault but then again if the did not have such a wacky bag and weight policy I would not have been forced to repack in pressured conditions and made to the mistake I did and lost a unique souvenir. I'm yet to actually fly but I'm not expecting much now. Sure I should have read all the policy info, but the point is when compared to the competition operating in the same market Peach is miles behind on customer service. I did read reviews here that said as much, they were 3 years ago, I assumed the airline may have improved since then. Not so. Fly Peach but just make sure you read the fine print with these guys. Or better still fly another LCC.

### Peach Aviation customer review
Busan to Osaka 4th July 2014 and no issues whatsoever. The seats were comfortable for the short haul and the staff were friendly. The aircraft was brand new passenger welfare and safety was carried out diligently. For a low cost carrier I would definitely recommend them to anyone wanting to explore East Asia.

### Peach Aviation customer review
I made two trips on Peach Taipei to Kansai and Kansai to Hong Kong. This is a low-cost airlines with few amenities (no in-flight entertainment no WIFI no complimentary beverage or food service but food and drink can be purchased). The staff were very friendly and efficient on both flights but their emphasis is on handling lots of people efficiently and less with catering to individual desires. (Both of my flights were filled with young adult tourists.) The prices for my flights were very low compared to traditional carriers. If you want to fly cheaply and don't mind the lack of amenities I think Peach is a great choice. Warning to tall people: The spacing between seats (29 in) is smaller than traditional carriers (30-32 in).

### Peach Aviation customer review
To those who complain about European LCs I would recommend a Japanese LC as Peach to see that EasyJet or RyanAir are not as bad as they look. Our flight an A320 was so late on arrival to Taipei and departure from Taipei that we landed at Midnight in KIX. Immigration + Customs. No more transportation available out of airport which is on an island! Peach did not take any measures (at least advising taxis) and we were just dropped off in an empty airport. They had their profit. They did not care as they had "apologized for the delay". Peach sells a Taipei-Osaka 6.50 flight which is late in nearly 70% of the cases. It always arrives close to the last buses out of Osaka Airport. They know it but risk is at passengers expenses.

### Peach Aviation customer review
Seoul to Osaka Round Trip (2/14 and return 2/16). Very popular route for Koreans to take a weekend trip! Excellent price for such a short flight (one hour and 45 minutes maximum). We experienced a weather delay of one hour due to random snow at KIX. As we were on the last flight out of Seoul we were scheduled to arrive at KIX the minute the last bus was scheduled to depart for Osaka. I want to say that Peach told the bus to wait for the plane. We were the only ones in the Peach terminal (T2) when we arrived and there was still a bus waiting on us 20 minutes behind schedule! The seats were a little tight and I'm 5'11" (180cm) but they're nothing unusual for an LCC. They offered snacks drinks and shopping onboard which a lot of people bought. We just bought a water (small mini Evian bottle). They take both currencies and cards which is convenient. The flight attendants were friendly although very serious about bags under seats and phones turned off. The only odd thing was that they didn't actually speak Korean (just Japanese and English minimal pre-recorded Korean) and the flights were about 96% Korean 3.95% Japanese and 0.05% foreigner. I would gladly fly them again.

### Peach Aviation customer review
Sapporo to Osaka Kansai. Peach are a fantastic low cost airline! The whole experience from check in to flying was faultless. The staff are very attentive polite and professional. Onboard food (for purchase) was delicious. I would definitely fly with them again.

### Peach Aviation customer review
ICN-KIX-SDJ SDJ-KIX-ICN: Fantastic experience all-around. Every flight was either early or on-time and flight attendants were top-notch on all four flights. The new Sendai LCC Terminal 2 which only services Peach Airlines at the moment is clean quiet and all around stress free and I never waited more than 1 minute for immigration check-in or security. Unlike other low cost carriers I never felt like Peach was "out to get me" by slapping on additional fees and whatnot which I absolutely appreciate. I will definitely fly again in the future and I hope Peach continues to expand!

### Peach Aviation customer review
Kansai-Sendai. Lovely new planes with wide leather seats attentive cabin crew and easy self check in at both Kansai and Sendai airports. Great value for money much cheaper and quicker than the train. Will definitely use Peach again.

### Peach Aviation customer review
FUK-KIX MM152/MM159 A320-300. New aircraft and clean. I was in the middle seat enough space and nice leather seat that was comfortable. Staff are very friendly and polite. Drinks and snacks are for sale but it was only about 1 hour flight so I didn't get anything. There is LCC terminal at KIX. Its new and clean. Everything is smooth. Easy to check yourself in.
