### “Quite impressed”
Quite impressed as I was not expecting much, the ticket was very cheap brand new aircraft, very cleaned and smelled nice. Pretty good legroom, seat next to me vacant so it was comfortable flight. Two hot meal services - main meals not very good, but was happy with fresh fruit on the tray insider tip - when offered SEAFOOD NOODLES, don’t expect wok stir fried asian style noodles...you will get something that I would expect in Swedish kindergarten (see photo below) crew don’t speak much English and the service is somehow chaotic, but not too bad IFE quite limited, but enough for me.

### “impressed on the cabin cleanliness”
Overnight flight from KL to Shanghai on their relatively new B737-8 plane. Was impressed on the cabin cleanliness and seat was pretty comfortable. But would preferred to be on a wide body aircraft for a flight time longer than 3 hrs. Cabin crew were polite. Food was ok. But for the price I paid for it was cheaper than some low cost carrier. Would not hesitate to fly with them again.

### "Old fashioned business class seats"
Shanghai Airlines has the same level of quality as most mainland Chinese airlines, an abysmal low one. Old fashioned business class seats, one of the worst meals I ever had in my long flying life, indifferent crew, the only positive point being the appropriate schedule.

### "miserable food for a business class"
Shanghai Airlines has the same, low standard as most Chinese Airlines: old fashioned seats, miserable food for a business class (though they had some good wines), indifferent service, an individual movie screen but no earphones. On the positive side: timely departure and arrival. My only reason to elect this airline was the schedule, as price is comparatively high as well.

### "punctuality, good service"
Budapest to Shanghai New Years Day 2020. Flew on a newer B787-9. They had opened not less than 8 check-in counters in Budapest of which 4 are for Sky Priority only; thus very comfortable. BPs issued immediately including the following flight with China Eastern SVG-HKG (counts as international flight). As being Flying Blue Silver I was accessed to Sky Priority counters and was checked in in a few Minutes; prioritised in all queues and boarding, and eventually (at gate) upgraded from Economy to Economy Plus as flight was full in lower classes and in business. I was lucky not to have my original selected seat as all seat were taken in economy. Trip went smooth, captain made kind announcements. FAs were also kind and firm though listening. Lots of food, they ran out of wine and beers within an hour after departure. Very embarrassing but quite typical for Chinese airlines (apart from Cathay Pacific?). Bought own supplies of champagne from airport. FA off course accepted it as they know they are running short, especially on a New Years’ Day. I brought my own glasses and let them chill down my champagnes. Good food, two full hot meal rounds with options. Catered from Budapest, thus Western oriented unlike when departing from Shanghai. I had at least 6 hot meals on board (many were meals in excess as passengers were stuffed after New Year) and could have had more if I could manage. At breakfast service, still 24 dinner meals were left. Clean toilets throughout. Blankets and earplugs provided. Individual IFE was extremely good and technically the best I have seen in the skies. Content limited to some 15 Western movies but that suffices as their choice goes beyond the most popular Hollywood stuff. Simultaneously, plenum monitors display the current flight data and maps. Arrived 25 Minutes early in the huge, completely over-dimensioned Shanghai airport. I rate them high as for Qatar Airways though the product pros and cons are quite different. The trick is not to have Westernised expectations and to appreciate all, what they do for you if you are firm with wishes and appreciative. Best with Shanghai Airlines was the new aircraft, its punctuality, good service, surprising foods (I tried and finished all sorts of dishes they offered, all were fairly tasty), and an unbeatable price.

### "was a very positive surprise"
Hong Hong to Budapest via Shanghai. Flew on A320 on HKG to Shanghai while in a newer B787-9 on the long haul to Budapest. China Eastern marketed flights. The long haul leg was flown by their daughter company Shanghai Airlines to Budapest. Amazing experience, pure adventure. Bought this ticket some months earlier for the high season to Europe as a huge bargain for 347 USD including 2 x 23 kg of luggage which is welcomed near X-mas. It costed me in addition positioning and depositioning flights to which I volunteered as I needed the extra miles for my elite status. However, I was notified (2 months before travel) by my online travel agent (Travelgenio), that the return flight from Budapest was preponed by 1 hour. Then, I was forced to change as I would not be able to arrive in time for the new departure. I then decided to change plans completely and celebrate New Year in Budapest instead of Vietnam. Thus, I postponed my return travel from Budapest by 3 days. This was done by emails to the Travel Agent (no response) and then phone calls to Ch. Eastern in Brisbane and Shanghai. Eventually, it went smoothly and I was changed to my wish without added costs (apart from changing onward flights beyond Hong Kong with another airline). That even allowed me to do another, cheap detour to Hanoi on my way back to Hue. The homepages of China Eastern and Shanghai are difficult to penetrate and to book or change bookings from. Unless one has a Chinese telephone number. However, 10 days before departure I could access seating and chose freely my favourite seats, even got 1 of 4 legs in exit seat. However, one cannot access the entire booking unless registered with CE’s flyer program in which I am not interested. Apart from that it was a good adventure: a complicated travel where everything could have gone wrong, but all went smooth. Arrived in Hongkong early and was able to check-in 6 hours before departure as the airline have many departures daily. No queues at the check-in and the ground staff were good and answered questions though fearing speaking English. Two BPs issued immediately. Flying HKG-PVG is considered as international flights though it could be considered as domestic. That give the advantage of not leaving transit while leaving HKG and passing PVG. First flight was on an aged A320. Extremely controlled and organised priority boarding at gate where all business and elite flyers were boarding entirely before the remaining passengers. Onboard, newspapers and 10 channels of music were offered (bring own headset). Shared monitors showed some educational movies. Food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits. Drinks were unlimited (water, tea, coffee, beers), but only for 1 hour out of the 2½ hour long flight: during ascend and descend all services were closed down until 40 Minutes after kick-off and again 40 Minutes before landing. That leaves passengers with very limited time of service. FAs were fine. The second flight were by Shanghai Airlines’ Boeing 787. It was a very positive surprise and was faultless. Modern aircraft, good food and service, 2 hot meals offered at dinner and then again at breakfast. Frequent drink rounds. Button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly. Individual IFE on touchscreen monitors was very easy and quick to operate with a good number of Western and English translated movies. Toilets clean. Both flights took off earlier than scheduled.

### "Just unbelievable"
Not Verified | Shanghai to Guilin. The company cancelled their 1st October flight without reason on September 30th evening (few hours before departure). Only option proposed was to take a flight on October 3rd instead (2 days of holidays ruined). We finally decided to cancel the whole trip as it did not make much sense and we were asked to pay for the cancellation fee of the return ticket. Just unbelievable.

### "two days of my trip ruined"
Shanghai to Phuket. I bought this ticket because it was cheaper than the other options. The flight was alright, the attendants were nice, but when I got to Phuket... no bag. I had checked just one bag with all my stuff in it for my trip. Now it’s been 2 days since I landed and no one can tell me where it is. It was scanned in Shanghai and seems to have disappeared. My emails to the company have gone unanswered. My hotel has been calling the airport each morning to check and see if it has arrived and so far, nothing. The first two days of my trip have been ruined. I came here to do some training, yet all of my training gear was in my bag.

### "delayed for 16 hours"
Shanghai to Seoul. The first and last time riding Shanghai Airlines and  China Eastern Airlines. The check-in was chaotic because only 3 or 4 check in counters were opened. During the security checkpoint, the checking was way too slow for me, and I was waiting 3 hours. It was the final call for boarding- and I was bussed, and I rode the airplane, but it was delayed for 16 hours for no reason, staying in the airline and the flight attendant gave only me nothing. No offerings, no services, and no refunds.

### "it was a pleasant flight"
Shanghai to Kota Kinabalu. Shanghai Airlines code shares with China Eastern Airline. It was a new plane and the flight experience was good. Although one of the air steward seems like he hates his job but overall it was a pleasant experience. The meals served was exactly the one I was served on my trip to Shanghai. Nothing special, something to fill an empty stomach. The seats are comfortable whereby the headrest was tiltable. We were given pillows and blankets on the flight but the flight was kinda warm even though we flew during the night. Coming from someone who cannot really stand on cold, the flight was really warm. Overall, it was a pleasant flight, nothing special to praise or criticize about, at least it got me safe back home.

### "a worn-out B737 plane"
Shanghai Airlines flight from Guangzhou to Shanghai. The flight was more than two and a half hours late. We had to get on a follow-up flight and then we went on the connecting flight. Waiting for more than 4 hours - no basic refreshments were offered to the waiting party. We asked the desk clerk to call or send a message to the company with whom we had to continue the flight, but it was refused. The counter clerk also did not give any details while waiting when the flight would leave. The flight itself on a worn-out B737 plane, broken chairs. A flight meal under any inspection. Since the flight was delayed and because we had missed the connecting flight, we turned to the company for an alternate flight. The company disclaims any liability and sends us to the company of the connecting flight. Perfect contempt. We got stuck all night at the airport, no hotel or refreshments were provided. A blatant disregard for their commitment to the passenger.

### "just at the standard level"
Shanghai Hongqiao to Lanzhou. As a Skyteam Elite member I could use the priority check-in counter and priority security lines. It was very wonderful. The service of cabin crew was just at the standard level. The meal was simple, and the kind of the drinks was not enough. The seat was comfortable.

### "have the worst customer service"
Shanghai to Kuala Lumpur. My flight is in December and they change the flight early and we don’t have enough time to connect. Expedia and myself have been try to contact them for the past week and nobody pick up the phone. They have the worst customer service and if possible do not fly on Shanghai Airlines. I am still waiting for them to answer their phone.

### "we had to go standby"
Never use your frequent flyer miles from one airline and get placed on Shanghai Airlines. We had a confirmation number and ticket number from our partner, and Shanghai Airlines could not locate us in the system so we lost our reserved seats and had to go standby. Ticket counter said we'd have no issues on return flight. Guess what? We are standing in Bangkok as I type with the exact same problem with a sold out flight. Seems they don't put you in the system if you are using another airlines miles, even though they are partners, or at least that's how it looks from our end.

### "they don't seem to care"
We booked a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. The part from Kuala Lumpur to Shanghai was operated by Shanghai Airlines. Departure time was 2.10am out of Kuala Lumpur and expected arrival in Shanghai at 7.20am. The inbound flight already arrived 30 minutes late so we boarded the plane at 2.30. The seatpitch at seat 33A and B was okay and after showing the safety instruction video on the screens we expected to depart. To our surprise the cabin attendant announced a delay of 3 hours due to ATC-restrictions by ATC Singapore. The gate was already disconnected and the boarding door was closed so we had to stay in the plane for over 3 hours. A cup of water and a meal were being served at 3am. After that, we had to stay in the plane and we were told to stay in our seats. There was no information from our captain and the flight attendants hid in the galley. Out of the blue the plane was pushed back from the gate at 6.05am. Without information we departed out of Kuala Lumpur. No idea how long the flight was going to take and what the arrival time in PVG would be. During the flight they served one croissant (which origanally would be served during the dinner we received at 3am) and half a cup of Chinese tea. Our bags never made it to our final destination and are still in China. Today, 3 days after the flight with Shanghai Airlines/China Eastern, we still haven't received them back nor did we get any info about our bags. My advice is not to fly with Shanghai Airlines. They don't seem to care about passengers and their bags and leave you without any information.

### "fly them again on this route"
Seoul Gimpo to Shanghai Hongqiao return for a long weekend. As with all Gimpo international flights, it was 100% full and extremely short. Plane was clean, in good condition. Only a bottle of water was given with a tray of food. Ignore the food as it's just beef and rice in some kind of sauce. The food seemed the same in both directions. As far as cabin service, all of the Korean staff were polite. GMP-SHA there were a few, obviously tired and sour Chinese attendants wearing a visible frown and throwing the food on the tray. At 240 USD round trip all in, I don't really care about the service on these short flights. No seatback TV, but again, the flight was barely an hour and a half. No time to watch anything. The plane was clean, leg room adequate and, surprisingly, on time given Chinese airspace. I'd fly them again on this route.

### "don't choose Shanghai Airlines"
Tianjin to Shanghai. Terrible service, terrible food and terrible airplane. Dirty and smelly, the cabin staff so miserable and horrible. Delays again with no announcement or no apology. If you come to China and you fly on a scheduled not budget airline, don't choose Shanghai Airlines.

### "comfortable seats"
Flew Shanghai Airlines from Phuket to Shanghai Pudong on a new Boeing 737-800 on an overnight flight. Best economy class experience, very clean and new plane, comfortable seats with lots of leg room. Very good and tasty food. I would fly Shanghai Airlines again.

### "absolute disgrace of an airline"
Hong Kong to Shanghai Pudong on Shanghai Airlines. For reasons as yet unexplained to me, we boarded the aircraft at 16.45h and remained on the aircraft on the ground until 23.40h (yes, an unbelievable 7 hours), when we were then told that “the flight is now cancelled” and we deplaned again. During the time onboard neither the captain or first officer spoke with the passengers and the cabin crew made three announcements stating only that "we would be updated on the departure time later". An absolute disgrace of an airline and crew.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
The plane had a foul odor throughout the flight. The plane sat on the tarmac for nearly an hour before going anywhere. The food was hardly edible, though not necessary for the short 2 hour flight. Lukewarm beer was served free of charge. The plane itself was old and in need of retirement. The seats were about as cramped together as any I have seen.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
I fly with this airline regularly between Shanghai and Hong Kong because it's one of the few airlines that lands in Shanghai Hongqiao airport, which is more convenient for me. Convenience is my only motivation, as this airline is bad. Poor food. Staff will tell you to switch off your phone 30 mins before landing, but do not stop customers using phones. Seats are uncomfortable. I really wish there were more options between SHA and HK - but unfortunately I am stuck with Shanghai Airlines.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
FM9312 May 28th 2015 Guangzhou to Shanghai. I have been traveling with this airline for four years when on occasion I cannot find another airline that suits my route/timing requirements. I find them to be consistently very delayed with little or no information in Chinese or English on the duration of the delays. I generally feel that a delay of two hours is 'par' for this airline and anything leads than this is a very good result. I would strongly suggest against flying this airline if on business or if arriving on time is a priority.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
We bought two tickets to travel from Melbourne to Beijing via Shanghai (late Dec 2014). Without any prior knowledge we were put on Shanghai Airlines instead on both legs. Outbound aircraft was a bit old but the inbound was rather new and clean. IFE (English programs) are rather limited and not up to date. They didn't change the movies selection (our outbound and inbound flights were in different months). Established airlines usually refresh the IFE at the beginning of each month. Food was ordinary very Chinese and please bring your own food if you are hard to please. The FA served water very regularly two thumbs up. Too many announcements (turbulence related) and we were very annoyed. Passengers should have some common senses and not require reminders from the FA's. All in a very basic airline.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
From Pudong to Shenyang on December 12. Flight on time which is already a big plus as most flights out of Pudong are delayed by "traffic control". Even with the heavy snow in Shenyang landing was smooth. Cannot comment on the food never eat airline food. Very annoying is the constant barrage of announcements in Chinese and not- understandable English prevents you from taking a nap. Gold status on Skyteam is never honored in China bag as one of the last to appear on the carrousel even with the priority tag on it.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
April 6th CSX-SHA. On the flight to Shanghai the plane was very new and the lights in the cabin were warming and comfortable cabin crew were okay but not very impressive they were very rushed during the flight but understandable as it was only a 75 min flight. Inflight entertainment was a shared TV. Shanghai Airlines really need to improve their cabin crew on common knowledge during the crew announcements they mistakenly said Skyteam as Sky Alliance. Overall a satisfactory trip but not impressive.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Flight FM846 29 Dec Hong Kong to Shanghai. Flight left 40 minutes late. Paid quite a bit extra and given it was only 8 seats you would expect reasonable service and have a bit of peace and quiet but it seems that if you are in economy you just use any toilet. This was business class you pay the extra for the trimmings and expect a higher level of service and cabin separation. Normally because you have paid more you get a mini bus for business class passengers but there were none. Will be wary of code share flights from now on.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
I was just in the booking process for a Shanghai-Xian flight in discounted first class when they interrupted my input and changed the fares. Instead of a surcharge of 20% above the eco fare they lowered the economy fares substantially and came to a ratio of 1:3. I immediately switched to the new discounted eco fare landed at less than 40% of the original budget and felt "quite comfortable". The flight from Hongqiao Apt to Xian takes a little more than two hours - one can really accept all the environment and service features they offer. Clean 737-800 with better seat pitch than most European airlines. They offer a hot snack en-route (two choices) a limited beverage selection (no alcoholic beverages). Do not expect a sophisticated IFE just those small screens above your head for every second row. The flight was fully booked absolutely on time and a real bargain - what more can you expect? My marks are once again quite high for this China Eastern affiliate.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Shanghai to Nanning on July 4. Delayed nearly 2.52hours sitting on the plane with hardly any air-conditioning. However the Captain kept us periodically informed which was good. Flight was okay except the flight attendants did not smile. Check-in was ridiculous! I had to open my checked-in baggage cause they suspected (1) my less than 50 ml bottles of skin care and (2) a small hotel sewing kit!

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Took a flight from Beijing to Shanghai. Flight delayed. The 757 didn't appear to be very old but obviously poorly maintained. I've taken flights on 30-year old planes which looked much better than this one. Tray table locks were loose and broken and a lot of them opened during takeoff. Closet locks in lavatories were also broken and doors were wide open. Most staff were poker faced and unfriendly. I won't take their flights if given an alternative.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Shanghai (PVG) to Xi'an. FM9205. Check in at PVG seamless friendly staff Enjoyed the China Eastern Lounge. Bussed out to the aircraft but with a separate comfortable sit down shuttle bus. Aircraft was a bit older but the leg room in First was astonishing. At 2 Meters+ my legs were able to stretch out completely. The attendants tried their personal best to speak English food was fine and the flight was on time. I was sceptical after reading all of the other reviews but must say I was completely satisfied with the service and the price.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Chengdu-Shanghai Hongqiao with very old B757 flight delayed 1hr as usual took shuttle bus for boarding even Chengdu New Airport terminal is almost empty! Seat very hard and narrow and dirty food awful and tasteless crew friendly and still provide efficient service somehow.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Flew from Seoul to Shanghai Hongqiao. The plane both ways was a rather old slightly dilapidated Boeing 757. No entertainment was available but the service was friendly and efficient. The food on the outbound flight was much better than the flight back where we were just given a dry sandwich.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
SIN-PVG on an outdated 767-300. Booked China Eastern but the flight was operated by Shanghai Airlines. IFE was via a projector projecting onto a screen at the front of the cabin but for some unknown reason it was not used during the 4hr 40min flight. Seat was a recliner seat (what you usually find in domestic business flights) and they were very old and worn out. Leg rest on my seat was broken and the tray table on the seat next to me was broken. The fabric on the seat behind me was torn. As I was in the front row there was a bit more legroom than other business seats but for a 180cm person my leg was still hitting the bulkhead. Legroom for the seats behind were around the same as an economy seat on most other large airlines. Food was very average and staff service was quite good.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
PVG-HAK. The 'Ryanair-style' legroom in their B737-700 shocked me. Definitely insufficient for almost 3 hours flight. Catering was slightly better than on the flights with the parental China Eastern but still I expected more.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
SHA (Hongqiao Apt) to TSN (Tianjin) on a relatively old 757-200 showing some signs of use. Economy class fully loaded. Takeoff with 2 hours delay due to late arrival of the plane from another location with dense fog. But the dedicated cabin crew handled everything with high efficiency. Food on this leg of 1h45min was standard but fully ok in every aspect. For the price I paid (early booking) I got an excellent value and thus can only express my satisfaction and recommendation.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
PEK-SHA. Rebooked at China Eastern check in on earlier flight with Shanghai Airlines B757-200 quite old but much legroom excellent service - staff with good knowledge in English no inflight entertainment Chinese newspaper in English arrival on time - excellent value for money. No complaints.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
SIN-PVG on a fairly new 763. The service was mediocre food was edible but not the best. Toilet had no water and only a tiny bar of soap. My biggest disappointment was the seat comfort. Legroom was so tiny that a 6 ft person even when sit straight could barely fit into the small legroom. The magazine holder makes it worse as it was dangling down and our legs were pushing against it for the entire flight. Passengers were forced to squeeze their luggage in like sardines or overspill to other overhead compartment. This is a popular route and is always packed a A330 or B777 or even larger plane should be used. Very Disappointed if not for its lower price I would have chosen Singapore or Cathay.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Flew from Xian to Beijing in April on a 737-800. Flight was on time and the aircraft comfortable. Had a window seat behind the wing and had the most leg room I have encountered in a narrow body. There was even a fold out foot rest under the seat in front. Food was nothing special a snack box type thing and a drink. Handed out with a smile from crew which were otherwise not present. The box contained western style food with bread roll and butter packet of savoury biscuits a slice of cake and some fruit. Satisfactory for the short mid afternoon flight. Would be happy to see this airline on my itinerary for future travels in China.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Flew from Bangkok to Shanghai on B737. Legroom was good and the seats comfortable. Cabin staff attentive. A positive experience.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
From Beijing to Hangzhou. Just before the flight was about to take off an announcement stated that the plane had engine failure and we would have to wait for it to be repaired. It was a 40 degree day and we were not allowed to get off the plane nor was there any air conditioning. Arm rest was almost off its hinges the seat was uncomfortable and despite only being 160cm tall there I had no leg room. The food was appalling. Never flying them again.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Shanghai Hongqiao-Lijiang on old B737 early morning flight (7.40am) however still delayed for 2 hrs due to air traffic control (according to Shanghai Airlines). Seat and leg room is very narrow and uncomfortable simple breakfast and low-quality beverages were served for this 4hrs flight no entertainment.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
July 2012 Shanghai to Melbourne. Business class. Overall the flight was good but the attention to takeoff and landing procedures was appalling. We had many people using Ipads and other devises while takeoff and landing. Luggage on the floor that should have been in a locker again during takeoff. There was absolutely no in-flight entertainment and the seats were old and even though they reclined back the leg rest was uncomfortable. We were offered drinks with a meal but no more. The planes were old and very tired. When I asked about an express customs card they had absolutely idea of what I was talking about as some of the staff really struggled with English.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
SHA-HKG on a 4 years old Boeing 737-800 (B-5370) delayed for 4 hours without explanation. Check-in staff in Hongqiao airport were very rude and unwilling to speak in English. Seat pitch was ok due to emergency exit row but the cabin looks worn and toilet was very dirty and dark. Cabin crew look tired and again speak no English. Food consisted of a "Handmade" sandwich which appeared totally unacceptable. I will try to avoid Shanghai Airlines at all costs.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
2am departure from Phuket to Shanghai. Flight was good no problems aircraft old still had ashtrays on the arm rest no inflight entertainment. Yes I would use this airline again.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
TNA-SHA on quite new and very clean 737-800. Seats were comfortable and emergency row legroom was very good. Service on the 1 hour 20 minute flight was very good cabin staff quite friendly and had good English skills. A hot meal and snack was served on the flight and 2 serves of drinks. Very good value for money on time.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
The flight from Nanjing to Beijing took off on time and landed on time as scheduled. Staff were not very attentive but spoke good English and were very polite. Inflight meals were excellent and much better than I expected. The aircraft we flew on looked a bit tired and had a basic cabin and seats but seats had plenty of leg room. One thing that let the airline down was the lack of inflight entertainment but it was only a short flight so this did not matter as much. Overall I am happy with my experience with Shanghai Airlines.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Shanghai to Melbourne - 1.5 h delay before boarding and after boarding was closed another delay of 2hrs. It was a China Eastern flight operated by Shanghai Airlines. Interior was from the 80's and when the passenger in front of me reclined his seat into a sleeping position the back was on my knees. The food looked very poor. This was my first and last long range flight with China Eastern/Shanghai Airlines.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
PEK to HGH in Economy. Slight delay out of PEK but otherwise uneventful flight save for the very loud passengers which I suppose is not the airline's fault. Airline offered a meal on the 2 hour flight which was nice. IFE was on main screens with all Chinese programming.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Fly with FM frequently on Shanghai-Taiyuan Shanghai-Changsha and Shanghai-Kunming. More or less delayed for 30-50 minutes each time. Shanghai Airlines joined Star Alliance in 2007 then Skyteam in 2011 they didn't improved their quality and still stay at the 2-star/budget airline standard. Nothing to eat for meal bad quality of drinks for domestic travel China Southern (CZ) is much better.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Harbin-Shanghai on B737. Seat was fine inflight entertainment non-existent. Food wise was typical Chinese snacks and drink rounds sufficient. Flight attendants were prompt in responding to requests. It was followed by another flight Shanghai-Singapore on B767. The seat was fine inflight entertainment was minimal. Food wise was again Chinese snacks. I don't mind flying China Eastern/Shanghai Airlines due to cheap airfares however inflight entertainment could be improved upon.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Gimpo (Seoul) to Shanghai return. Ground staff good flight attendants helpful even receiving a beer prior to takeoff. First flight was Gimpo-Shanghai uncomfortable takeoff but after that no problems. Shanghai-Gimpo return - no complaints good staff no entertainment but is a short flight good landing and on time. No problems. I would recommend this airline from a cost perspective but that would be all. The best part was the 757 - great aircraft.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Kunming to SHA was scheduled to depart at 19.20 however it was delayed. So at 19.10 we were taken by coaches to a nearby hotel where we had a meal and slept until midnight. We were then taken to the airport where we were given €30 cash compensation and an airline meal. The flight left at 0210 - a B757 and we could stretch out across three seats so it was reasonably enjoyable flight with food and drink provided. The way the airline handled the delay was an example to European airlines. Also many thanks to the Chinese people on the flight who ensured that we were looked after.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
They no longer seem part of Star Alliance. Shanghai to Yantai they first changed time from 1600 to 1405. Then 3 days before flight changed to 1055 as their flight was cancelled. Had a similar experience before.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
CTU-PVG on B737-800. 2 hours delay. Supposed to depart at 1925 turned out to be the inbound flight did not arrive until 1945. We got on board but sat on the tarmac for another hour due to heavy traffic. Asked the crew the estimated departure time the answer was 'I have no idea'. Seats all right for domestic flight however I was on the last row right next to the lavatory and it smelled badly. Passenger's cell phones started to ring when we were still in the air just before we touch down the crew did not do anything to stop them. Not a good experience and I prefer to fly with China Eastern instead of Shanghai Air.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
BKK-PVG. Had window seat but middle seat unoccupied so I got to stretch out. Cabin crew spoke little English but were friendly. Chicken with rice and veggies acceptable Economy airline food.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Shanghai PuDong - Ha'erbin. Check-in the easiest I've encountered. Took a bus a fair distance out to the plane. Flight wasn't full and they spread people seating throughout the plane. Seats good amount of space. The best flight experience I've had in China.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Vancouver to Shanghai Pudong airport connecting Shanghai Airlines to Phnom Penh Cambodia. Staff at the Shanghai Airlines desk could not track down their plane that we were to board at 7:50 pm. (Turned out to be an almost five hour delay as they kept changing boarding gates on us too). They didn't delay or cancel the flight or take our baggage. Airline staff were very mixed up and didn't seem to care too much. Many people argued with them loudly. After two hours they said we'd better re-book for the next day and they'd look into hotel vouchers for an over-nighter and a bus would come. We were very jet-lagged and understood we only had a 24 hour transit visa in China which meant we'd be in trouble overstaying the visa if we re- booked for the next day. If this happened we assumed we'd be okay over-staying because the airline should look after this. Airline staff had no idea. We re-booked anyhow but right after they found the flight and began taking on passengers. When we tried to get our re- booked ticket on the 'found' flight which was our original flight they denied our ticket - said it wasn't valid or something. The only way to get out on our original flight was to buy a ticket on it at the counter. One airline counter staff woman told my wife it would cost 160USD each for each one way ticket. Fair enough but when we paid and got our etickets and read them they'd charged us $1915 USD! Counter staff wasn't able to convert the currency from CNY to USD. We argued with them to no avail and they merely said that was the counter price. We called Air Canada from the airport and they said their agreement with Shanghai Airlines ended Oct 30 - but we booked Oct 27th. Shanghai Airlines did not honor the ticket yet had a few days remaining. Pudong Airport does not honor toll-free calls. They take a very expensive cut at their terminal business center. The young girls at the Shanghai Airlines counters looked good but didn't speak much English were not informing anyone as to what was going on with the flight and basically tricked us into buying another ticket at a ridiculous price.

SHA to HKG with B737-800. The seat was comfortable but legroom was quite tight. The cabin attendants were friendly and spoke good English. The meal was good (surprisingly sandwich on Chinese airline!). The flight entertainment was not available even though there was ear phone socket and they played some documentary on the overhead monitors.

PEK-NKG and SHA-SZX. The flight from PEK was on a very old 757 with the narrowest seat pitch I've ever seen. I'm only 5'7" and my knees touched the seat in front of me! The bathroom was ancient and had only bar soap. On the plus side the breakfast was decent. SHA-SZX was after my China Eastern flight made an emergency landing so Shanghai Airlines used a 767 instead of a 757. The 767 was new and was quite comfy. Attendants friendly and sometimes nagged a bit about putting carry-ons in other bins that had space. Food also was good on this flight. There's absolutely no in-flight entertainment! There are headphone jacks but the system does not work.

Shenzhen-Shanghahi Hongqiao. Flight was delayed for 1.5 hrs because of aircraft late arrival and air traffic control terrible service bad food and very simple soft drinks were served. Flight arrived at the T1 of Hongqiao airport while Shanghai Airlines used bus to send us to T2 to claim the baggage.

HKG-PVG-HKG (FM810 B767. Friendly check-in staff. Speedy boarding and fantastic catering and onboard service. Return flight efficient check-in (though no self check-in machines) and offered an extra legroom seat (1st row of the economy cabin).Cheerful service from the crew and a tasty 3 course lunch.

Shanghai to Hanoi on a new and clean 737-800. Once in the air the flight was one of the best experiences I have had on an Chinese airline only Hainan Airlines is comparable (these 2 are streaks ahead of the rest). FAs friendly helpful and looked genuinely happy. I had a random window seat in economy yet I had the most leg room I have had on any internal flight on a narrow body aircraft. The food was very good. If I needed to be somewhere on time for a certain connecting flight I might choose an airline that has a better ontime record but if time is not so much a factor the pros traveling with Shanghai outweigh the cons.

Shanghai Pudong-Incheon Gimpo-Shanghai Hongqiao. Flights delayed for 1hr for both 2 legs very cheap fares compare with OZ/KE - you pay what you get food's very normal service terrible Shanghai Airlines is more like a budget airline.

Shanghai to HoChiMinh City. We were loaded onto the plane the door was closed and then we were informed we would have to wait an unknown amount of time. We sat in the plane for 2.5 hours before taking off. I have to fly Shanghai Air often and every flight I have taken in 2010 has been delayed / held for takeoff / late by hours.

Tianjin to Shanghai Hongqi. The flight and service itself was comparable to an Australian domestic flight but what really impressed me was the effort and communication provided by the Captain given the excessive delays that appear to be common place around Beijing airspace.

Shanghai - Qindao. The flight is a terrible experience. My flight is delayed for more than 8 hours (from 0600 to 1500) - the flight is only 1.5 hours. The reason - there is a fog during the night one day before! So the scheduling of the aircraft causes problem. The correct aircraft cannot appear in the right airport. And the ground staff of airline fail to compensate with an extremely poor attitude! Passengers did not get lunch at airport except a bottle of water and tiny cake. What a terrible star-alliance airline!

CAN-SHA by B737 SHA-CAN by B767. Both flights more or less on-time and we found the check- in procedure time spent at the "Star Alliance Gold Card" lounges and onboard service pleasant and trouble-free. Shanghai Airlines is still our choice for domestic flights within China!

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Shanghai PuDong - Guilin Shanghai HongQiao - Beijing. Generally not really satisfied with the service. I wonder how come they can be admitted into the Star Alliance. Food poor FA's service poor as well. Neither Asian hospitality or smiles shown by FA. When distributing the food FA even show a gesture of throwing the box of the food instead of serving it nicely. Shanghai - Beijing flight was delayed quite badly. Seat pitch and comfort just reasonable not really satisfying. Along with China Eastern is not a really good choice to fly.

SHA-LJG return. It is the worst flight experience in my life. The flight to Shanghai was canceled due to airport facility problem and stranded passengers were taken to a hotel. Around 0:00 AM we were suddenly required to depart and took a flight to Kunming. We arrived at Kunming around 2:30 AM. The airport staff said the passengers to wait in a hotel until the alternative flight to Shanghai which departed at 10:00 AM. However they said I (and another passenger) had to take another flight which departed at 9:00am and did not give us a hotel room. Instead they took us a dirty smelly office and said us to sleep there. Since the only one sofa was occupied by the other passenger I had no place to sleep other than the floor. I complained about the change and requested a decent place to sleep but they were just saying "No" and did nothing except saying I was not the only one who had no room and what I could do was to wake up an employee and ask him to share his room or sleep on arrayed chairs. I tried to get a room by myself but the nearest hotel was full and they said there was no taxi or bus in the midnight. I was forced to spend the night on a dirty hard floor while the others were sleeping in a hotel. Of course I was not able to sleep at all and felt sick. Such an inhuman treatment should not be allowed even when the cancellation is not the airline's fault. Avoid Shanghai Airlines or you will be treated as trash.

A flight from Beijing to Shanghai was delayed for about 4 hours because the aircraft had some safety and technical problems. The normal procedure is to be booked on any of the various other flights that go every hour. However Shanghai Airlines refused to do so and gave no information during the waiting time when the airplane will take off. The customer service was disrespectful. At first they denied the fact that plane was delayed. Replies took a very long time. Compensation was not offered.

Shanghai Hongqiao to Shijiazhuang delayed for 1.5 hours as usual B737-800 old but well maintained and clean no entertainment for 1 hour and 45 minutes flight uncomfortable seat as quite narrow snacks was served but tasteless. Have to fly with FM as China Eastern is worse.

Shanghai Pudong - Shenyang. Was able to check in at the self service counter and was even able to input my LH M&M card number. Checked bags in at the desk and changed seats to the emergency exit. Security empty and fast. The new T3 is very nice (still slightly lacking in shops you'd like to see) with bright and clean waiting areas. Delay announced but we ended up leaving on time. Drinks and snacks served onboard. Nothing amazing but adequate for the duration of the flight. Landed early. Shenyang airport a mess with about 8 flights using just 2 conveyer belts.

SHA-KMG-LJG. SHA to KMG was operated by a Boeing 737-800. Economy class seats extremely cramped with not much legroom. Later I switched to an emergency exit row since the flight was not full. Food was rather simple compared to CA and MU. It was a box full of snacks. KMG-LJG on a Boeing 737-700. A hamburger which was inedible was served. Overall not a very pleasant experience.

SHA - PEK Economy on B767-300. Booked online passport was sufficient checking in a matter of seconds. The plane was clean comfy seats and most generous legroom I have ever experienced in an Economy seat. 2x3x2 configuration was nice. Relatively friendly but not overwhelming staff probably speaking not too much English got along with Chinese well. Food was OK Chinese certainly not for everyone though. 3 drinks in roughly 90 minutes are far above domestic European standards. Only annoying thing: The standard "please remain seated turbulence ahead" messages every Chinese carrier plays all the time even if there won't be any.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
Yichang to Shanghai in April. I had to fly first class as economy was full but for an extra £50 it wasn't too much extra. The flight was on time and although first class wasn't what you would expect from other airlines the seats were comfortable with good pitch.

### Shanghai Airlines customer review
PEK - Shanghai. Check in Beijing was very quick. The crew were very friendly and spoke good English. The safety announcement was only given in Chinese on a drop down screen which you could not really see. Both domestic flights were on a fairly old 767 and full. Complimentary drinks and food served on both flights.
