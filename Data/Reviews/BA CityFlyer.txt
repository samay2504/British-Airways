### “Staff very friendly and attentive”
I fly this route regularly but usually in Economy, as this was a busy weekend there were no economy tickets remaining so I booked Business/Club Europe. I never deal with check-in as I'm always hand luggage only, I headed straight into the airport and decided I'd try out the OneWorld lounge at Schiphol as this was included. There was a huge queue with people being turned away from the Lounge front desk, this however turned out to be for another provider's lounge, I checked with the front desk and was allowed to enter the OneWorld lounge. This lounge was nicely furnished with plenty of food and snacks available, nice, quiet restrooms within the lounge were also available. This space was a welcome change from the hustle and bustle from the rest of the terminal and I relaxed here for a while before my flight. The staff were very friendly and attentive. When boarding time came I made my way to the gate, of course passengers ignored the boarding order and all just crowded the gate, this left multiple priority boarding passengers unable to board until most of economy had seated, Schiphol's ground staff need to be more organised in this respect. On the plane, as this is only a 2+2 seating layout the seating was no different to economy, I expected this and the Embraers are quiet spacious despite being smaller planes. Our food and drinks orders were taken before take off so the dedicated ClubWorld staff could serve as soon as possible on the short flight. Food was a cold dish, but was a very tasty Asian style chicken and slaw, various other snacks were included and I had 2 glasses of champagne, because why not. Staff were very friendly and attentive despite how short this flight was. Arriving at London City was like it is in any class, quick and simple. Overall the experience was good, and for the difference in cost in Avios points I will now be doing this journey in ClubWorld rather than Economy in the future.

### "flight was on time and very good"
I found that I couldn't make my Ryanair flight back to London and, to my astonishment, found a BA flight to London City (my favourite airport) for 10.88 euros. The flight was on time and very good. My one, slight, hesitation is that I wish BA had told me that I couldn't check in online at San Sebastian. Other than that, I have no complaints. Indeed, at the airport, I asked the check-in desk if they might block the seat next to me, and they agreed. Once on board, I drank wine and ate a snack and was very content. If only flying was always like this.

### "onboard service was laughable"
Not Verified |  Cabin crew were friendly and polite. Delayed 2hrs due to chaos at EDI on the outbound. However the onboard service was laughable. 86ml of water and a miniature packet of crisps described as light snack. Very light!! Had the audacity to announce it was complimentary! I know there are supply issues as well detailed in the media but that was a joke

### "Such a disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  Having previously lived close to London City Airport, it was my airline of choice for european routes. Having moved to Canada, it was my first BA CityFlyer flight in about 5 years. Biz class from Berlin to LCY was a real let down. My partner and I were moved from 1C/D due to the galley configuration to 4A/B and then on the day we were split between 3A and 4A. I presume this was to accommodate a gold card flier. (who refused to change seats when I asked on board) With a flight deck and cabin crew dead heading back to city, the cabin service unfortunately took a nose dive after take off. The two pilots were served by row number and before row 4 leaving pax with a choice or sandwiches or sandwiches. After the meal and a drink / T&Cs the curtain was closed with 4 crew behind the curtain. No more drinks, and glass only collected as we started descent into LCY with basically no service for the last 30 mins or so. I'd still use BA CityFlyer for the convenience and comfort (better leg room), but dead heading crew should know better than to distract the Purser at the front, whilst the purser should remember who the customers are. (she was meant to be looking after). Such a disappointing experience

### "a lovely flight with BA Cityflyer"
Overall a lovely flight with BA cityflyer, as usual. I will review both the outbound and return. EDI-PMI. Check in wasn’t particularly friendly at EDI- no consideration for priority as a business class customer. Fast track security was good. BA lounge at EDI had a poor selection of food in the morning but plenty choice of drinks and staff were lovely. EDI - PMI flight on E-190 aircraft. 2-2 configuration for business and economy. In business the drinks were flowing constantly and a wrap was offered to eat. In economy a sandwich and free bar was also offered. Crew were friendly. PMI - EDI. Check in at PMI was chaos and took an hour for priority! Fast track security was quick. Lounge was drab and we only stayed for a coffee. There was food and drink available. Flight was good. I was in row 7 and only Arabic chicken dish left- it didn’t appeal and I asked for an economy sandwich- they only had vegan option available- sweet potato and cranberry. It was ok. Crew were lovely and drinks were flowing constantly to those that wanted it. Again economy was given free bar and a sandwich. It was nice to travel club Europe as a treat but to be honest on a 2.5hr flight low cost airlines are more than fine.

### "the flight was very enjoyable"
London City to Berlin. British Airways' subsidiary BA CityFlyer really exceeded my expectations for such a short flight. London City is a great alternative to London Heathrow as flight prices are similar, and it is much more convenient and less crowded as it is in the city centre and is a smaller airport. The check-in and bag drop were all self-service but could be done easily and quickly, with staff present to assist. We boarded the aircraft very orderly, in different boarding groups. The seats on the aircraft, an Embraer E190, were wide and comfortable, with more than enough legroom for economy class, especially for an hour flight. The cabin was arranged in a 2-2 layout, so it was pretty spacious. Service provided by the crew was excellent and they provided a packet of chips and a drink. Overall the flight was very enjoyable and we arrived in Berlin on time.

### "Very nice flight"
Dusseldorf to London City. Very nice flight, including free Snacks and drinks. Legroom was okay and staff was friendly but seemed a little stressed due to a huge amount of hand luggage in this flight. Inflight magazines were old.

### "The crew were marvellous"
Return Edinburgh to London City BA's CityFlyer remains the most pleasant way to get to and from London from Edinburgh. The Embraer 190 has much better legroom than the 170 so look out for the type flying when booking. The blue leather seats and 2 - 2 layout make for comfort. Trip to London City on Oct 2 at 08:45 on the EMB190 was wholly smooth. Fantastic view of the three Forth bridges on departure. So much legroom and space, and I'm 6ft 1in & 19st. On time more or less, pleasant crew, and a free breakfast of bacon rolls or a platter of fruit salad and organic yoghurt. Water, and hot drinks. Just what was needed. LCY is so easy to get through in arrival and I was on the DLR to the city in 10 minutes flat. A great start to the day. Returning home on Oct 3 at the 14:40 on the smaller EMB170 was much less comfortable due to turbulence for at least 20mins thanks to the tail of a US hurricane passing over GB. The reassuring captain apologised several times and explained he was trying to get clearance to a higher level. Good to be kept informed. The crew were marvellous. Kind, cheerful, the best of BA. Drinks and snacks served despite the plane lurching about. All comp, including a good Glenlivet malt. Edinburgh arrival fine and into tram within 20 mins of touchdown. These jets aren't new and it does show a bit but it's a cut~above experience still compared to the alternatives. The tickets to LCY on the travel app I use are a little more than Gatwick but if you can miss the absolute peak flights the difference isn't much and, to me anyway, worth it for the good service and central location and efficiency of London City Airport.

### "Average short haul experience"
Zurich to London City. Average short haul flight experience. Easy and smooth morning flight to London. Cabin was narrow but ok, although not very clean. The business class was half empty and the cabin crew was sometimes friendly, but most of the time enjoying themselves while chatting to each other. BA served hot food on this short flight: it looked not good and it was not good. Otherwise nothing special.

### "would recommend CityFlyer"
Not Verified |  London City to Paris Orly. I arrived just over one hour prior to my flight and proceeded to check-in. Whilst the queues were not long, it did take at least 20 minutes due to the multitude of bags of some passengers. Boarding was orderly and we left on time. The E170 has a lot of legroom compared to other BA cabins, though the cabin has started to look a bit dated with older seats and torn magazines. The onboard service was appreciated, though it was not exceptional. The service was somewhat lethargic, but they were attentive. After about 45 minutes, we began our descent into Orly. Overall, it was a great flight and if you live somewhat closely to LCY, I would recommend CityFlyer over the regular BA service ex-LHR.

### "could be a quality carrier"
London City to Granada . BA Cityflyer still feels like it could be a quality carrier worth paying for if only details were paid closer attention to. London City is a delight to fly through even though it was a bit overcrowded and the fact check-in staff were directly employed by BA really paid off as they were warm, welcoming and friendly. E190 is a pleasure to fly, the legroom is fantastic and the 2-2 seating is fantastic for couples travelling as we were. The inclusion of complimentary food and drinks with a full bar service that includes alcohol (and quality Fever Tree tonic) is appreciated. Quickly off in small but perfectly formed and clean Granada was also a nice end to the flight with luggage out immediately. Unfortunately these positives are really cut with some quite prominent negatives that are very noticeable. The plane was not clean. Secondly the crew - some of these really shouldn't be working in a customer facing environment. Lastly the food while complimentary is of poor quality.

### "service was atrocious"
London City to Mykonos. I usually love BA Cityflyer from LCY - really good airline, nice planes and plenty of room. This trip we flew Club Europe to Mykonos - a 3hour 45min flight. The service was atrocious. There is no BA lounge at LCY so really the only differentiation is the on-board product; they should really make an effort. The crew spend most of the flight chatting in the galley. They eventually came out after 50 minutes and gave us a drink. Food was good, but they did not provide ice-cream or desert as per the menu. The CSM dropped a salad at my feet, tomato all up my legs and on my shoes without an apology. The remnants just sat there for the rest of the flight being trodden into the carpet. No tea and coffee was offered. No hot towels. In fact, there was very little engagement with any passengers. This was not a bust flight, there was no turbulence or other reason for a lack of service. It really did just appear that the crew could not be bothered. Such a shame when a business ticket on this flight costs nearly £300 one way, On a positive note, we flew back in economy and the service was far superior! This may have just been a bad experience but come on, BA, you should be delivering what you advertise. I have complained but I guess it will fall on deaf ears.

### "not value for money"
Remote stand at Edinburgh with overloaded long bus ride to get there. Aeroplane nice but floor dirty, and crumbs in harder to reach to clean places. Clearly given no more than a cursory wipe. Cabin crew didn't smile and weren't chatty, but were efficient. Cheese and tomato toastie was tasty, coffee acceptable and good to get free service. Legroom good. Seat comfort good. Landed 5 mins late in London City and had gate furthest away from the domestic arrivals hall so long walk through corridor and up some stairs, down again. City airport conveniently located to get to London though. Basically all was fine but not amazing, and not particularly premium, and not worth the price. A good, but not value for money option.

### "still include food and drink"
I flew London City to Palma return on an Embraer E190. We left on the outward journey on time and arrived slightly early. The return was nearly an hour late leaving because of the aircrafts late arrival. I had exit row seats both ways. Unlike its big brother, BA, Cityflyer still include food and drink which was fine.

### "did exactly what was said on the tin"
I flew Business class on the nifty 76 seat E170 jet out of London City routed to Dusseldorf. The cabin interior looked a bit tired inside, the jet being 10 years old and prior to this the aircraft served with other airlines. Whilst Eastern Airways won’t be in the league with the legacy carriers, I found the flight comfortable and the crew courteous and attentive. Overall no complaints with the fight, we were delayed outbound and the pilot made up some time en route. Eastern did exactly what was said on the tin and that was getting me from A to B as comfortably and safely as possible.

### "excellent airline"
Due to my work I was required to travel to London, however as no airline offered cheap prices on such short notice, I decided to travel with BA CityFlyer from Rotterdam to London City. Traveling to Rotterdam The Haque Airport is pretty doable by public transport from Rotterdam Central Station or The Hague Central Station by bus and/or underground. Once arrived, I went straight to check-in my luggage which was fast and efficient as there was literally no queuing time. After passing the usual struggle at security I had a hour left before boarding starts. Due to work in progress on Rotterdam's terminal, there wasn't much to do (wifi was fast and constant though with lots of seating areas). Boarding was done in a nice and efficient way, however what do you expect of only boarding approximately thirty people? The cabin was comfortable. Plenty of legroom, leather seats and a good view in front of the wing, however I'd like to note that it would have been better if they actually replaced their magazine and safety card by a new one as the current one was in a very very poor state. Departed on time, it was a pretty short and straight leg with the pilot informing us several times with departure, arrival and weather information and 15 minutes into flight, the flight attendants served us a pretty limited service for British Airways terms (might had to do with a short flight of only 55 minutes), which included a drink of choice and a biscuit or chips. Once arrived with a not so smooth landing, the plane was quickly parked and deboarding started within a few minutes. Walk to customs (in peak, this is terrible) and baggage drop-off was just a few minutes. BA CityFlyer is an excellent airline providing you with plenty of legroom and friendly staff, however I still found it very pricey and catering could have been improved.

### "still complimentary catering"
Edinburgh to London City. BA CityFlyer still offers the sort of premium service you used to be able to expect of BA. As I was flying from Edinburgh I was able to access the excellent lounge at the airport thanks to my frequent flyer status (BA Gold). The lounge is spacious and has plenty of sockets to charge up your devices and desks in order to work. On-board the aircraft is configured 2-2 seating and the legroom is much better than the mainline BA flights into Heathrow and Gatwick. There's still complimentary catering in economy on flights to London City and this (for me) meant a beer and some crisps. I occasionally travel business class (Club Europe) on this route and the catering offered there is more substantial than that offered from Heathrow/Gatwick. All in all it's just a much better experience. Once landed it's less than 10 minutes from the aircraft door to the platform of the DLR. It's the best way to travel if you need to be in Edinburgh for a day of business.

### "is an excellent option"
Enjoyable and trouble-free travel on BA City Flyer. I've found that by making sure one has as much time as possible between flights for layovers this takes the stress out of flying these days with high aircraft utilisation the norm. I've noticed that so many complaints seem to be over problems caused by missed connections due to delays caused by air traffic issues or bad weather, or both. The Golden Rule is simple! - never trust the short transfer and connection times between flights listed on airline web sites or suggested by some travel agents - its just not worth the hassle these days, even if that means staying overnight at an airport hotel for your next flight, especially if that is long-haul or vv. Anyway, I allowed many hours between my flights through London City (a delightful little airport) and was also able to fit in a business meeting at the airport. BA City Flyer flights on the smaller EMB190 jet are excellent. Cabin crew were very attentive with my only complaint being that cheese dishes were all that were available - when are airlines going to realise many of us cannot east cheese (or chocolate) due to the subsequent increased risk of migraine attacks. My GP knows this and has for years, why don't the airlines? BA City Flyer is an excellent option and business class fares can often be 'cheap and chips'.

### "excellent flight experience"
Amsterdam to London City with BA CityFlyer on the Embraer E190SR. Check-in went well, however could have been quicker to drop of my baggage as two of the handling staff were apparently busy chatting with each other. Once at the gate, I chose to give my hand luggage to them to check into their hold as aircraft was full and as compensation, I was told that I could use their priority lane. Flight departed on time and arrived on time. During the flight cabin crew worked efficiently, however catering was quite poor compared to competitors on this line. Seating was spacious and comfortable. Landing was performed well in gusty conditions. Luggage in hold took it time to be on our belt, could have been faster. After all an excellent flight experience and money well spent.

### "excellent flight with BA Cityflyer"
Manchester to London City. Terminal 3 at Manchester was a nightmare, fast track was slow. The lounge was quiet and the lunch offering consisted of soup, sandwiches and cheese, crackers and crisps, together with the usual alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages including champagne on request. There is a view of the runway and taxi way which can be a pleasant distraction. Boarding was called and we made our way to the gate where our Embraer was waiting for us. After about 10 minutes we boarded and made our way down the jet bridge and eventually reached our long legroom seats in row 2 on the right hand side. Hot towels and menus were handed out prior to take off, followed after take off by drinks and meal requests. We both had champagne and the bbq'd salmon and salad, chicken salad was the alternative, accompanied by black forest gateau, all served together on one tray. Our cabin crew attendant was very attentive and although she helped her colleague to serve economy, still managed to provide us with excellent service on this relatively short flight. We landed facing west and quickly disembarked and was in the car park waiting for our car in a matter of minutes. An excellent flight with BA Cityflyer.

### "E190 are ideal for European flights"
My wife and I flew Berlin Tegel to London City with BA CityFlyer on an almost full Embraer 190. These aircraft are ideal for European flights, 2x2 seating and plenty of leg room. BA CityFlyer at the moment still serve food and drinks which I believe will stop later in the year. London City Airport is great, off the plane and on Docklands Light Railway in 5 minutes.

### "uneventful set of flights"
Edinburgh to Berlin via London City with BA Citiflyer. It was overall an uneventful set of flights. The in-flight service was fine with passengers receiving a drink and their choice of popcorn, crisps or biscuits. The frequency of flights between Edinburgh and London are great but the long layover at London City is unfortunate as there are no lounges to access.

### "superior service to BA"
Edinburgh to London City and first time flying BA City Flyer and enjoyed the service. Check in quick and polite, security busy but quick too, I had an hour in the Galleries lounge which was okay for a coffee. Boarding via A8 and steps on to a nice looking clean E170 - Seat 1A very nice crew pretty chatty and funny actually. Departed on time one airborne a coffee and snack offered which apparantly BA proper can no longer afford on the EDI-LHR service. It's my first time on BA CityFlyer my first time on this type of aircraft and my first use of London City. Landed a few minutes early, bags off quickly a great service. I find BA's franchises or subsidiary operated services such as Comair in South Africa or BA Cityflyer normally operate a superior service to BA.

### "still give drinks and a snack"
Amsterdam to London City. I was not originally on this flight, I was due to go to Southampton with KLM but the flight along with many others was cancelled because of the weather. The wait at the KLM transfer desk was running at over an hour so I gave up and went to BA. Very good price for a flight to LCY three hours later. Unlike their big brother (British Airways), BA CityFlyer still give drinks including alcohol and a snack on this short trip. Left an hour late due to weather. Crew fine.

### "a seamless and professional experience"
From the booking process to arrival into Dublin this was a seamless and professional experience. Check-in was friendly and efficient and boarding was managed in a professional and logical manner. The flight had a short delay but they was explained and communication was superb. A drink and snack was on offer and my bag was delivered promptly from in Dublin. I found the cabin crew to be friendly and hardworking and very well turned out. I was comfortable and enjoyed the service and would use them again for sure!

### "a disappointing experience"
Zurich to London City Airport. No real business class experience. The gate for this short haul flight was very unusually at Terminal E, some additional 15 minutes away from the main terminal. Luckily I had only little hand baggage and had checked in on-line before, otherwise I would have missed the flight. Boarding was rather chaotic, no special lane for business class. The seats were okay, but narrow and cramped. As it was an early morning flight we got hot breakfast, with was disappointing in quantity and quality: the fruit salad looked tired, no muesli nor yoghurt. A disappointing experience, but rather typical for flights to City Airport.

### "cabin was clean and tidy"
London City to Berlin Tegel. This is the first time flying with BA CityFlyer for about 10 years as they gave up the route to Riga. This was only short hop to Berlin but the service both on the ground and in the cabin was first class. The food was tasty, cabin was clean and tidy. The announcements were clear and concise. On arrival at Tegel, we were parked away from the terminal and buses to take us to the terminal were waiting as we landed and once in the terminal the bags were with us in minutes.

### "great experience with BA CityFlyer"
Great experience with BA CityFlyer from Mykonos to London City. Seat configuration 2 x 2, comfy seats, almost similar to a premium product. No inflight entertainment but with a relatively short flight at just under 4 hours that's okay. Would be nice to have a hot meal in economy in the evening, dinner was a chicken and potato salad. LCY a breeze to get through immigration, took less than 2 minutes and bag collection 20 and was on my way. Would highly recommend and hope BA operate more flights from here in the future.

### "we left and arrived on time"
My wife and I flew Glasgow to London City on an Embraer 170. The flight was full and we left and arrived on time. These regional jets are ideaL for this type of journey, 2x2 seating with good leg room. London City is a breeze, out of airport onto the DLR, central London in 15 minutes.

### "left and arrived on time"
My wife and I flew from Dublin to London City Airport in an Embraer 170. The flight was full and left and arrived on time. Drink and a packet of crisps given out. We handed over our cabin bag because of the full load and ended up waiting over 20 minutes at City Airport for it. Still got Victoria Station in half an hour.

### "impressed with the meal service"
Madrid to Amsterdam via London City Airport. Very good flights with BA Cityflyer. Legroom and comfort on the Embraer were good, and I was impressed with the meal service from Madrid to London. A choice of meal tray with cold salad and desert was offered, and on every flight a second drink was offered. Crew was young but very professional and polite. Transfer at LCY was not great, we had to leave the airport and re-enter in just 45 minutes.

### "flight was very slick"
BA City Flyer is a slick operation out of London City, using the BA brand but often exceeding the general BA quality. My flight to Amsterdam was only 40 minutes long but they still managed to serve a hot breakfast to every passenger, including economy class. The business class breakfast was better than BA's usual standard (which is by no means bad). The operation of the flight was very slick, leaving dead on time despite starting boarding late and having to deal with getting a disabled passenger up the stairs into the plane. Landing in Schipol was a little early which was useful given how slow Schipol has become.

### "crew were friendly and efficient"
London City to Glasgow, and a excellent flight overall. On time, easily dispatched from LCY, so much better than LHR. Plane was clean and comfortable and seemed pretty new. Crew were friendly and efficient. We arrived 10 minutes early and bags available quickly at Glasgow. All in, an excellent experience.

### "E190 jets are comfortable"
Edinburgh to Amsterdam via London City, crew were friendly. Sadly the breakfast cut off had been passed so no hot BA breakfast, though I was able to grab some fruit and muesli in the Executive Lounge before boarding. LCY to AMS I was served the best meal I've experienced onboard : balsamic chicken with puy salad and figs. It did feel like a bit of a rush on such a short flight, but its hardly worth complaining. The E190 jets are comfortable. Same seats in business and economy, and large windows. So much better than the Airbus planes normally on British Airways flights. One downside is there is no BA lounge at LCY to wait in when transiting, so you have to make do with one of the cafes or the waiting areas.

### "stress free experience"
BA Cityflyer from London City to Madrid. Stress free experience from online check-in to arrival. No departure or arrival delays, 15 minutes early landing at Madrid Barajas. Comfy seats, good complimentary sandwich and several drinks runs: we had a couple of wines each, bottled water and coffee. Very competent mixed British / Spanish cabin crew had a smile and a friendly word.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
This was one of my best flights, crew well dressed, engaging and went that extra mile for customer service. The aircraft is small, but you pay for the conscience of less than an hour from home to departure out of LCY. The food was tasty.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
EDI-LCY on Embraer 190 operated by BA City Flyer in Economy – short domestic hop back to London City Airport. Flight departed on time but could not land at City due to high winds. Pilot tried twice but had to abort the landing and finally diverted to London Southend. During the whole time good information from the flight deck about what was going on. Once the plane landed in Southend, crew was well prepared giving out information during the disembarkation process about the options. Basically, passengers could use a coach to be organized by BA to LCY or people could opt to take public transport to London and have the costs reimbursed later. We opted for the Greater Anglia service to Liverpool Street Station which runs regularly and worked well for us. As for the regular service on board, full bar service and snacks were offered. FA’s were friendly. Service in Edinburgh was hassle free. We had no checked luggage and check in kiosks worked fine with no lines. Terraces Lounge in EDI was quite spacious and comfortable with some food and a nice selection of drinks. Excellent for a regional airport. Especially given the fact that the situation was weather related and clearly not BA’s fault, I felt that BA did everything possible to make the experience as hassle free as possible. Situations like these, when not everything goes as planned, tell a good airline apart from the rest. While the actual reclaiming process over BA’s website took longer and was less straightforward than expected, it finally worked and the difficulties involved were related BA’s procedures and information regarding requirements posted on the website. However, the agents worked with us to finish the claim and were actually helpful during the process . (Oneworld Sapphire)

### BA CityFlyer customer review
LCY-FRA on E190. Great aircraft for these short flights, 2x2 seating, plenty of room for carry on bags plus a beer and a snack. What's not to like. Flight on time.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
RTM-LCY. The lunchtime flight departed Rotterdam precisely on time. The aircraft has 2x2 seating with sufficient underseat space for hand luggage and a table big enough to work on with a laptop. Although small the Embraer 170 aircraft newly deployed on this route feels agile spacious and comfortable. Despite rough weather on the approach into LCY the flight arrived ahead of schedule. Service on board was highly professional with all passengers receiving complimentary drinks and snacks. The RTM-LCY service is a great way to avoid the crowds and queues of Heathrow and Schiphol.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
EDI-LCY on 31/08/14 and LCY-EDI on 03/09/14. The flights both ways on Embraer 190s were excellent but BA's customer service at LCY was less than impressive. There had been issues with low visibility at LCY on the morning of 03/09. After checking in at one of the machines I was walking past the BA customer service desk and noticed that two employees were sitting chatting to each other. I approached them and once they'd actually stopped chatting I asked if there was likely to be a delay to BA8716. Them: "What makes you think it might be delayed? Me: "Well there were lots of inbound delays earlier today". Them: "Not got a clue". No I'm not making that up. As it turned out BA8716 left bang on time and I have no complaint on that score but being told that customer service "haven't a clue" about the departure time of a flight due out in a little over an hour really isn't good enough.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
Used BA frequently to Frankfurt the last 6 months. Really friendly staff. Seats or OK given that I’m 6'7". Price is OK and it is value for money. Also travelling in an out of LCY rather than Heathrow is a bonus. No M25!

### BA CityFlyer customer review
AMS-LCY on EMB190. These aircraft's are great for European flights 2x2 seating plenty of leg room. Good service beer and snack on 40 minute flight. London City is a breeze at Victoria station within 30 minutes of landing.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
LCY-GLA/EDI-LCY - UK Domestic (there is one class only on UK Domestic flights). LCY is a favourite airport but having to tag your own bag before getting to the check in desk is annoying. Great smiling crews on both legs but the EDI crew were particularly very happy and jovial not bad considering it was a Sunday lunchtime flight down. Love the Embraer jets for the 2-2 seating which makes for a comfortable journey. On time departures and arrivals on both flights. Seating good and space adequate. Drinks and snacks ok but for the lunch time return it would have been nicer to have had a wrap or sandwich instead of just a small packet of crisps or cookies - although the Lilly O'Brien's chocolate shortbread was rather decadent! Well done BA!

### BA CityFlyer customer review
RTM-LCY. Short 40-minute flight in Saab 2000 turboprop operated by Eastern Airways. 1+2 seating with good seat pitch. Boarded by bus. In-flight service was to BA standard: full meal tray for Club pax drinks and snacks for Economy. No cabin separation. Limited bin space for bags but enough under-seat space. Only discernible non-BA feature was ban on mobiles throughout flight. Good value.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
AGP to LCY one-way. I occasionally upgrade to Business Class to get lounge access and - most important for me - more space. The E190 which BA Cityflyer operates on this route has good seat pitch and comfortable seats but the 2x2 arrangement means that you'll be sitting next to someone on a busy flight which mine was (I was travelling alone). I have no complaints about the service and the food though I'd mention that I was the third person to be served the meal and the last person to have a choice. The lounge at Malaga is spacious and plenty to drink but little food. and the Wi-Fi didn't work. Not a bad experience overall but the lack of space in Business was a major disappointment and I won't be using again if travelling alone.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
Flew on new BA route to Granada from LCY on 6 Sep. Appalling organisation at the check-in area. Total chaos. Stood in bag drop queue for solid 30 minutes. Slow security resulted in nearly missing flight despite being at airport well over an hour before departure.. Pouring with rain - no air bridge - we boarded plane to be told by pilot that the airport system to calculate weight of bags had failed and he was doing it manually. He was a bit concerned as we near our maximum weight. Hardly reassuring. Plane eventually took off 50 minutes late and faced strong head winds through France resulting in an hour's delay vs hour landing time. Crew made up for it by offering excellent service. Flight back much better - still an hour late but less people and totally relaxing. Inflight catering much better than LGW.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
FRA-LCY-FRA on excellent BA Cityflyer - what a pleasant experience! flights in Business/Club Europe fairly lightly booked and very good value if one chooses carefully. Meals wine and close to on-time performance out of Docklands (which is such a classy little airport in downtown London) made for such a better experience than slogging through Heathrow. I enjoy the smaller Embraer aircraft and sense of personal service on BA Cityflyer.

Flew economy from London City to Mahon Menorca on 6th Sept. Flight was overbooked so some people got bumped off and flight was delayed 1 hr 30 mins whilst they tried to sort it all out. Had to stand in very crowded gate area whilst this was going on. Staff attitude was appalling and they told a different story re overbooking to the one the pilot gave on the plane - so who was telling the truth? On arrival in Mahon discovered our luggage had never been put on the plane. Luggage was then supposed to arrive the following day but this was cancelled and it was then moved to yet another flight and didn't arrive in Mahon until late Sunday night. However still wasn't delivered to our hotel until Monday night at 8.30pm. First trip with BA since early 90s and vowed then not to use BA again as the flight was so bad surly unhelpful crew etc. We fly at least 3 or more times a year and find that Middle East airlines and Virgin are far far better in terms of customer service.

LCY to Mahon in Euro Traveller. On time arrivals and early departures in both directions. The E190 is a great plane with comfy seats and great leg room. Cabin staff were competent and polite and nothing else. Unfortunately the food offering on the O/W leg has been reduced from a cooked breakfast (0945 departure) to a tiny roll (Tuna Tuna or Tuna) and a one fingered kitkat. (Chicken chicken or chicken on the return). One bar service in both directions but a second drink provided when asked for. Its a shame the Mahon route isn't all year round but it continues to provide a great way to start and finish a holiday in Menorca.

Flew out of LCY to Menorca on 9th August and back on 23rd August. Excellent service and fantastic legroom in euro traveller. All the benefits of free hold luggage and good hand luggage allowance. On board snack and drink also supplied within ticket price.

LCY-BCN-LCY. on CE. I love LCY as you don't have to walk for miles. You come off the DLR down to the check in desk. Because we were flying Club Europe we were able to the use the dedicated check in desk so that was quick. Security was very quick and friendly. They seem to have even more security zones than my last trip. No lounges at LCY. Boarding was on time but no priority for CE pax or OW elites. However given as they board from the back and front of the plane it didn't mater. On board the 2 crew worked hard delivering the breakfast meals out to a full plane load. Nice product but the eggs were are bit crumbly. Arrived on time but bags took a while to come out with no priority. Return journey from BCN was good. Check in a breeze. Sala Miro lounge to wait in but being on the cusp of lunch there wasn't much in the way of fresh food about. Boarding was done by cabin/status. Not as full as before - 6 in CE only. Both meal options were salads ie fish or meat on rocket with some other little bits. Could have done with more leaves and some vegetables! Dessert was some cream concoction imitating an Eton mess. The crew were good and even offered their meal to a pax that didn't fancy the options. Bags at City came out in some order ie some priority bags then standard then a few more priority. Still a quick airport to exit. Shame BA is cancelling the LCY - BCN flights from August. I hope they bring them back.

LCY-AMS-LCY for a weekend break. Flight delayed and then cancelled subsequent flight delayed again aircraft changed and departed 3 hours late. No communication from ground staff. Flight home on time. Excellent cabin service in Club Europe with light meal served. Cabin crew excellent on both sectors. Will choose again as normally excellent service from LCY - will put it down to BA Cityflyer having a bad day.

Travelled London City/Palma and return 7th-14th March. Both flights on time and comfortable. Pre-flight announcements from flight deck on return journey concise yet full clear and with touch informality that gained attention. Cabin service sound and hot breakfast on outward journey quite acceptable. The 'snack' on return journey eminently missable: best option is to eat to your choice at Palma airport.

EDI-LCY return in one day. I was expecting delays and various other bumps along the way as it was the height of the London Olympic games but everything went smoothly. Edinburgh airport is run well with the exception of beings bussed to the E190. Onboard the aircraft was clean bright and modern. Inflight service included a round of drinks and a light snack which is more that sufficient for an hour and 15 minute flight. The return flight that evening was just as good. This time a short walk across the apron to our E170 and onboard again clean and comfortable. Inflight service of drinks and warm snacks suitable for the evening shuttle. I was lucky in having Row 01 seats on both legs so amply leg room.

Flight crew are helpful and friendly but BA’s airport facilities are lacking! As this is a BA CityFlyer (only a subsidiary of BA) you don't get many of the advertised (and paid for) benefits of flying BA Club Europe. No Lounge no dedicated check in no priority boarding no fast track through security no priority baggage handling no choice of meal inflight. On wet days expect to get wet at London City the planes wait in stands away from the airport building and BA do not offer umbrellas etc. Once boarded the plane we were too full to take off on a wet runway had to wait for over an hour BA while ground crew worked out who had to be asked to disembark from the flight – could only imagine how stressed I would have been if I was actually flying from this airport on business. All other airlines seemed to be taking off okay but i did not see 1 BA flight take off while we were grounded.

London City to Mahon and Madrid back into City. No delay at check in and a breeze through security. 15 mins delayed departing LCY with no explanation from ground staff who just seemed slow. An ok hot breakfast and tea / coffee was welcome though I was surprised that there was no bar service after the meal was served. Return from Madrid was delayed an hour due to the flight deck walk around finding a scrape which needed checking out. A drink from the bar was fine but a 18 gram bag of savoury snacks is an insult. City flyer remains superior to flying BA from Heathrow mainly due to the E190 being a spacious and new plane. However with a bit of effort BA could achieve a better level of service - especially around catering.

LCY-BCN-LCY. As usual cannot fault this airline and its service. Passed through LCY with no problems and boarded the spotlessly clean Embraer 190 on time. Welcomed on both sectors by a friendly smart and efficient cabin crew. Surprised to receive a full hot English breakfast which was most welcome followed by a complementary bar service. Will most certainly use this airport/airline more often where possible. Anything to cut out LGW/LHR.

LCY-EDI-LCY operated by BA Cityflyer. Excellent flights on the Embraer E170 (out) E190 (back). On time departure and early arrivals on both legs. Complimentary hot breakfast on outbound leg (passable at best) bar service with a sweet or salty snack on the return more than enough for the 1 hour 10 minute flight. Friendly crew nice modern jets. LCY was busy on the outbound but the airport had opened the overflow (ie former) screening haul and it took all of 10 minutes from DLR to airside. Edinburgh busy on the return but queues well managed. Accessed BA Terraces lounge in Edinburgh courtesy of my Gold card with Cathay Pacific which was uncrowded with a reasonable selection of food and drink. All in all very good.

Barcelona to LCY. Used at the end of a 29 day cruise. A modern Embraer 170 2+2 seating which is a major plus. More than adequate legroom and no pressure on overhead storage. Very attentive purser in particular. Food only a snack but more than adequate for short flight. Prompt departure and on time arrival. Quickly through immigration and onto car.

AGP-LCY Economy. Fast check-in no queues at Malaga. Bus to aircraft (personal hate) but sent off buses quickly without cramming them full. New clean Embraer 190 plenty of legroom but storing hand luggage was a problem. Helpful professional cabin crew. Nice sandwich and a drink. Time to do some work before descending into LCY. Confusion with steps on landing had to wait 10 mins on board before disembarking. Good value for money given that no extra's had to be paid for compared to low cost airlines.

FRA-LCY. Took off nearly an hour late in Frankfurt due to weather flight uneventful until about 10 mins before landing had to do a missed approach due to bad fog. Had to divert to BHX and waited an hour for a coach to LCY arriving at 12.30am when we should have arrived at 6.40pm. Very frustrating although not BA Cityflyer's fault. Its put me off using LCY as an airport due to its small size and how the weather affects it.

Checked in at Glasgow International Airport at 09.30am to catch the flight to Naples. Once onboard we were told that the trolley with hot paninis drinks etc would shortly be coming through the aircraft. Perhaps one quarter to one third of passengers at the front of the plane were served hot paninis the only hot or substantial food offered. Minutes later it was announced with apologies that the paninis were finished and that the only food available were muffins and pringles. This flight over lunchtime and lasting just over 3 hrs had run out of hot snacks - absolutely hopeless. The amount of legroom and the 2 seats rather than the usual 3 seats together was greatly appreciated and the efficiency and cheerfulness of the cabin staff was excellent. Same on the return one week later cabin crew were wonderful but could only offer apologies for not accepting Euros. We had no sterling so had to do without for the 3 hr trip - the stewardess gave my husband and me a small bottle of water each and 2 small packets of biscuits out of her own allowance. Take off times and landings were on time and no complaints there. Would definitely use Cityflyer again but please consider taking Euros for payment of food and drinks on board and make sure there is enough hot food on board for all passengers.

Flew MAD-LCY. An excellent experience. Great legroom spacious cabin with 2-2 seating configuration. Service was professional with smiles. Will definitely fly them again.

Barcelona-London City. Check in smooth. Slightly overweight luggage accepted with no extra charges. Boarding was good and departure punctual. Aircraft an E90 felt roomy although the placement of armrests was anything but comfortable and my arms kept falling asleep. Crew was jolly and seemed to enjoy their work. Inflight service was the bare minimum consisted of a single beverage run only and choice of biscuits or granola bars. Arrival was an absolute nightmare: London City airport closed the runway during our approach apparently due to a bird strike. Ended up in a dizzying holding pattern for more than 30mins which made some passengers ill. Pilot finally decided to divert to London Stansted the absolute furthest airport from the city. Was told buses would take us into London. After more than 1hr of sitting on the ground with no offer of water or any other service from crew and at first being told that buses were being organized and we would be on our way shortly pilot finally told us we would be taking off and heading for London City as they had reopened the runway. Finally arrived at our destination 2 hrs behind schedule having only had a small cup of tea in the more than 4 hrs since we left Barcelona. The runway closure was of course not BA's fault but all in all not a very pleasant experience.

GLA-LCY E-190 aircraft. Very full flight but cabin service was excellent and friendly and the flight both punctual and enjoyable. Would highly recommend BA Cityflyer to London City very quick and efficient connections to city.

LCY-MAD Embraer 190. Business class but not so you'd notice! What you don't get : advance seat selection (only option is to check-in online 24 hours in advance to discover that others have somehow managed to get in before you) priority check-in fast track security (doesn't exist) Lounge none no Priority boarding. So you've boarded the aircraft and there's not been a jot of difference travelling business class. Board the aircraft and you sit in exactly the same seat as everyone else but yours has a headrest cover!. Arrive at Madrid and your bags come off last. What you get : a hot meal but no choice of menu - stewardess walked down the aisle telling everyone that the menu was 'steak and potatoes' (actually lamb).

LCY-ARN. Outstanding economy service. Brand new E170 jet with leather seats. The hard working and pleasant two man cabin crew served a hot English breakfast coffee and then bar service twice on the 2h 30m trip (aided by plane being only about 70% full). 10 minute late departure might not have raised an eyebrow at Heathrow but the LCY ground staff apologised and the crew made it up en route.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
LCY-GLA-LCY return. New Embraer 170 excellent and comfortable flight. Heavy fog caused flight to be diverted to London Stansted on return trip obviously outside airline's control but meant long delay in waiting for coach transfer back to London City. Everything well organised although we had to wait for passengers from a second diverted flight to also arrive and join the coach transfer across town. Whilst inconvenient there was realistically nothing that airline could have done about the situation. Flights good transfer a bit slow.

Return flight London City to Glasgow on Embraer E170. Crew very friendly. A personal greeting was given at the door by the purser. Lovely aircraft very new and comfortable.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
The new Embraer fleet is excellent 2x2 leather seating. Staff helpful so far every flight has been on time and City Airport is brilliant. I checked in for my flight to Zurich last week 12 minutes before the flight and they still let me on. Noticed the pilots have made a point of the fact that Cityflyer is not mainline BA therefore they're not subject to the strike action so I've been booking upcoming trips with them with confidence.

MAD-LCY Flew in C class mainly to use Iberia lounge at Terminal 4S which has excellent work facilities as well as hot food and genuinely high-quality wines. Boarding the 70-seat Embraer E-170 was swift and efficient. Business cabin (2+2) was comfortable with decent seat pitch. Food and drink adequate but not exceptional. Deplaning at LCY as efficient as ever. CityFlyer is a useful alternative to the major airports for Spanish routes which the airline is expanding this year.

### BA CityFlyer customer review
EDI-LCY on time. E170 comfortable like the 2x2 seating free bar and some snacks although the FA missed me and my neighbour. I chose with route as I thought of the connections to London Bridge station I must say the DLR and particularly the Jubilee line was rather slow - I figured it might have been quicker to go via LGW.

GLA-LCY-GLA return with BA Cityflyer. Return flight was cancelled due to bad weather at LCY. BA offered us nothing apart from rebooked us on the next flight out of London airports. Hotels near LCY fully booked so I opted for earliest flight departing from LHR at 0705 rather than spend a night in the expensive hotel in the city centre. I have to make my way to LHR at my own expense. BA have definitely failed in term of customer services and I would not choose to fly with them again.

London City - Madrid return in economy. New Embraer 170 fleet from City airport. The experience was excellent. Check-in seamless. Cabin clean seats wide legroom good. Very spacious feel although stowage room for hand luggage still rather limited. Service was excellent - a hot breakfast provided on the way out which was a pleasant surprise. Both flights on time and the captain kept pax informed. Good value for money and no obvious cutbacks noticed. As an executive club silver member lounge access in Madrid and free preseating is much appreciated - although check-in online free seating policy I believe works fine. Would fly with BA from city again and recommend them.
