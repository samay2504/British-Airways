### "never answer my question"
Not Verified |  They lost my bag while returning from Lebanon to Iraq. They never answer my question, never assisted me and when I ask them, they always tell me to contact them after two weeks. They don't give earphones.

### "flight is delayed for 11 hours"
The worst airline ever seen Today I had a flight from Beirut to Sulaimanyah. When arrived airport in Beirut i saw my flight is delayed for 11 hours with out any notification or any acceptable reason. Even the Iraqi Airways team at the airport they didn’t knew what was the reason of delay. I checked the weather it was good and no issues with weather in both destinations and the origin country. I am not recommending this airline for any one because they are very disrespected.

### "satisfied with my flight"
I took the 6am flight from Basra to Erbil, an Iraqi domestic flight. I bought the ticket the day before at the Iraqi Airways ticket office in Basra. They were friendly, spoke English and only take Iraqi dinars, no credit cards. I paid roughly the equivalent of $104. The flight left on time and was fine. The equipment was a B737-800. On the short flight, they served a breakfast tray with a lot of very sweet things: chocolate milk, an Iraqi Twinkie-type cake, a soft roll with jam and a banana. It wasn't really to my liking, but it was nevertheless an energy-packed breakfast which is more than one gets on European carriers these days! The flight attendants were friendly and we landed in Erbil on time. I was satisfied with my flight and wish other people would also leave reviews for this airline.

### "Never travel Iraqi Airways again"
Manchester to Erbil. We checked in with our luggage and showed that two of the female passengers also held a small handbags with them, we showed this at the check in with no problem. When at the gate to board in, one of the female passengers went on board with another family to help them since the family was of one mother and 3 children. When my self and my wife went to the gate to board they stopped us, telling us we had to pay £50 extra for the handbag that was our daughters handbag we were holding for her. They told us we either had to pay £50 cash or they would throw out things away or they would not let us board the plane. They would not accept my card payment at all, even though that's what I wanted to pay with. They also refused to give us any receipt. Never travel Iraqi Airways again.

### "B737 had good leg room"
I took 3 domestic flights with Iraqi Airways - from Basra to Baghdad and then a return to Sulaymaniyah. One was on a smaller Bombardier and the others on a B737. The Basra flight was delayed a couple of hours because of fog. No problems with that, it happens. I missed my next flight (on a different ticket to Erbil). The later flights were all full, so they changed my ticket to Sulaymaniyah at no cost. All aircraft's were good, particularly the B737 which was not very old at all. The B737 had good leg room, was clean, in flight entertainment and a reasonable snack was served. The smaller Bombadier, whilst a little older was perfectly OK. Overall, a good experience.
