### "many missed their connection"
Horrible experience. Our flight from New York left 3 hours late. While we were flying over Brazil the pilot suddenly announced that we will be landing in Brasilia because the crew had reached the maximum time that they were allowed to work. We had to get off the plane, go through passport control, pick up our suitcases and go and stand in line to do the check in again. We were in line for more than one hour because many people in front of us had to rebook connecting flights. Four hours later we left Brasilia for Sao Paulo. We spent all that time at the airport and the ground crew did not offer any refreshments. The plane from Brasilia to Sao Paulo was half empty, however, the flight attendant did not allow us to change seats so that we would have more leg room. The flight from Brasilia to Sao Paulo was just over one hour long and we arrived more than 7 hours later than originally scheduled. It is amazing that the crew could not work for just one more hour and instead about 300 people had to be inconvenienced and many missed their connection. When I called the TAM customer service center I spoke to a man who gave me the most ludicrous reasons as to why the crew could not work for one more hour. I had flown this route many times before with Delta or American Airlines and there were some delays but never this type of situation. TAM didn't even offer to compensate us for the delay. We will never fly with this airline again.

### "extremely happy about this"
After a long transatlantic flight, the last leg of my flight was with TAM from Sao Paulo to Porto Alegre. When I landed in Sao Paulo, I still had a couple of hours before my next flight. I went to TAM desk for the check-in and the person there offered me to take an earlier flight which was in half an hour. I was extremely happy about this. It's the first time that I was so satisfied with the airline staff. The flight was ok and with some snacks and a drink, nothing too special but as you'd expect in a one something hour flight.

### "basic transcontinental flight"
A rather basic transcontinental flight with TAM Airlines from Sao Paulo to Lima. Soon after take off a hot breakfast sandwich was served, however, after the meal service, for the next 4 hours no drink rounds followed. I was surprised that most anouncements where only done in Portuguese and English, and not in Spanish. Apparently there was IFE available, but only on your own mobile device and after downloading an app before departure. For an international connecting traveller this was not very handy.

### "I would recommend it"
I was returning from visiting a friend in Uruguay, and it involves a full day of travel flying TAM Airlines from Montevideo to London via Sao Paolo. They had in-flight entertainment on loop for 2h 30m flight from Montevideo to Sao Paulo, the flight from Sao Paulo to London was without concern. On the way out, my in-flight entertainment broke, and I had to do without for the flight from London to Sao Paolo. The crew were professional, seats were comfortable. As it was an overnight flight, they offered a two-course eveining meal and breakfast in the moring. All in all, I would recommend it as an airline to fly to and from South America with.

### "FA was friendly and attentive"
Ground staff of LAN was ok, not overwhelming nice, but ok. Seats in row 42 ok, IFE slow and quality ok. Service of FA was good, friendly and attentive. Quality of food as you can expect in eco. We had a transit at GRU to SCL and had to pass a security check where our water bought at FRA was taken. Strange! Upon arrival at FRA I had a damaged piece of baggage. But the ground staff wasnt interested in any way of alpologizing, but pointed out the rules for such case only. Overall nothing special, but a decent choice to travel to South America on long haul.

### "friendly and acceptable"
Frankfurt to Sao Paulo with TAM Airlines. Service was attentive, friendly and acceptable for economy class. Food is as good or less good as with other airlines. Seat is standard and what you get for economy. The IFE is rather slow and not as quickly responding as for example in the 787 of LAN. Overall a good and pricewise interesting way to travel to South America. Luggage was damaged upon return at FRA, but ground staff not interested in being friendly or understanding.

### "no staff of TAM helping us"
I was supposed to fly from São Paulo to Mexico City. We landed in Brasilia at 1am with very limited explanations from flight attendants. I am stuck in Brasilia with no staff of TAM helping us. Help has been limited to minimum from now. We had to wait for 3 hours last night (1am to 4am) inside the airplane and then another 4 hours (4am to 8am) to get an hotel room and a replacement flight (an explanation, a smile, a a glass of water would have been highly appreciated). I hope the replacement flight proposed this afternoon will finally take off, as many of us have to go to work tomorrow but it seems that it is not a concern for TAM Airlines.

### "staff were extremely friendly"
On our flight with LAN we had to change flights in Sao Paulo to TAM Airlines, retrieve our luggage and check it in again as we were flying a domestic flight to Rio and then to Santiago. There wasn't much time between the connections in Sao Paulo and going through immigration and changing terminals made it almost impossible. With 30 minutes before departure we didn't have our luggages checked in and there was a big line at the counter. The staff on ground made a great job in checking our baggage and then taking us to the plane in a minibus as we were the last ones to board. The luggage arrived safe in Santiago and both flights were on time! On the way to Rio there was a new A319 with lots of leg room and for Santiago an old A320 which gave us a lot.of trouble with many turbulences. The food served on TAM wasn't different from the one of LAN but the staff were extremely friendly. Still, the experience in Sao Paulo looked very chaotic to us and we would prefer LAN for further flights.

### "worst company I have flown"
I was flying TAM Airlines with family (I, my wife and 2 small kids) from Toronto to New York. Arrived to airport on time, checked in, but they gave us hard time with the baggages. After we passed security, and went directly to the boarding area, airplane was gone without us. When we tried to get our baggage back, one of luggages occurred to be lost (where I had all my clothing). We went to vacation without my clothes, and they found my luggage only after 21 days (when the vacation was over). They screwed up everything, and did not compensate inconvenience. Also, it is extremely hard to find any employee in the airports (we tried in both cities), they are like undercove" officers. I complained in emails many times, but no one ever replied. Phone lines also work terrible. The worst company I have flown!

### "bland and mundane experience"
3 flights with TAM Airlines from Rio de Janero to Asuncion Paraguay via Buenos Aires, which over the eight years I've flown with them has become a pretty bland and mundane experience. Inflight programe repetative pranks show Only Kidding' which becomes tedious and boring. The dated cream and red cabins look grubby and the downgraded meal service and reductions of bar service leave it an airline of neccessity not preference. Best I can say is flights on time and cabin crew of the Paraguayan sector (PZ) far more agreeable. PZ planes definately dated and tired and despite a new and glossy terminal at GRU you are still being bused to and from PZ flights. Long haul LHR - ASU booked for May so lets see how good the 'Magic Red Carpet' experience will be then.

### "3x4x3 layout very tight "
I flew TAM Airlines from São Paulo Guarulhos to Frankfurt on a Boeing 77-300ER, and I must say is torture, the seats are very tight. TAM uses the 3x4x3 layout which leaves very tight aircraft, the seats are bad, just recline. The service is also poor, and with little food.

### "not let passengers use them"
Yesterday I flew with my one year old child from Sao Paolo to London. Normally bulkhead seats are allocated for parents travelling with young children, disabled etc. But with TAM you have to fork out around 100GBP for this privilege one way! All bulkhead seats were empty during the flight but the flight attendants would not let passengers use them. They advised that an extra charge applies for those seats if we are going to use them. The food and drinks were quite poor. We were offered water only twice during 11 hour flight and breakfast was unedible.

### "unbelievable lack of skill"
Rio de Janeiro to Salvador with TAM. Check-in was messy and slow. Departure was delayed due to check-in mistake that let 2 minors traveling without any adult board and without the usual paperwork. Unbelievable lack of skill. They had to be expelled from aircraft and it took 1 hour to find their luggage, because TAM allocated only 2 persons to search. During this hour, no service at all was offered, FAs remained hidden, only preventing people to sit in the "seat plus" (that have a little larger pitch), and then running back to galley. Brand new A321, with pitch too small for someone taller than 1,75m. Sad experience.

### "business class was excellent"
London to Santiago via Sao Paulo, and on a tour of South America I took 7 flights with TAM Airlines and their subsidiary LAN. The international flights were business class which was excellent. Flatbed seats enabled a good 6-7 hours of sleep. The food was okay for airline food and water or alcohol was offered. All of the flights were on time and the staff were very helpful, even offering additional leg room seats when these were available. The inflight entertainment was limited however most people now provide their own.

### "just hope things improve"
London to Sao Paulo with TAM Airlines. Left London on time. Cabin staff very helpful and plane clean and comfortable. Food served for dinner and breakfast ok although only 1 alcoholic drink offered with dinner. VOD worked with latest films and water offered during the night. Arrived on time at Sao Paulo and then disaster struck, eventually informed after 1 hour wait that onward flight to Santiago would not be departing at 7.30am but 10pm. After walking around the airport and queueing for 2 hours and retrieving luggage we were eventually given vouchers for a taxi to dump of a hotel on the outskirts of Soa Paulo. Stuck there all day, no leisure facilities, industrial buildings surrounding the hotel and having to arrange hotel shuttle bus back to airport. Have several more flights booked with TAM Airlines on package holiday to South America so just hope things improve?

### "fly any other airline"
We booked and paid for a business air fare thru Expedia from Rio de Janeiro to Auckland. After booking we received an email from TAM saying aircraft change meant no business class was available are we are now premium economy. Turned up to check in at Rio to be told no premium economy or business class on flight, and are now economy! After 1.5 hrs being taken from one supervisor to the other with no success they finally booked us on economy class, and then informed us that our connecting flight with Air New Zealand also had no business class - a lie also as we are frequent fliers with them - so they would only book is in premium economy for the Buenos Aires to Auckland to flight. By this stage it was only 40 minutes to departure and just took the boarding passes! When we boarded the Rio to Buenos Aires flight, there was business class - then on our arrival in Buenos Aires we went to Air New Zealand and they changed our boarding passes to the business seats we had purchased! We were lied to by 5 different staff members of TAM airlines and just left at the counter for up to 30 mins at a time until we got hold of another supervisor. I would advise to fly any other airline unless you want to be lied or cheated out of your money! Also in flight entertainment broken to top it off.

### "if you can, avoid!
Foz do Iguaçu to Rio de janeiro, and TAM Airlines is a prime example of rip-off non-service culture. Overpriced flights, designed to take advantage of tourists, unfriendly staff who pretend they don't understand what you want. Dirty plane. We tried to rebook and they kept us on the phone (via UK mobile) for 17 min without providing any information if it was possible, just asking same questions again and again. Awful attitude all around, but they have monopoly so get away with it. If you can, avoid!

### "don't bother complaining"
London to Sao Paulo with TAM Airlines. Found drop down table was broken (I was not the only one with a broken table) and had to use a cushion to try hold it up while trying to eat a very poor tasteless diner. With dinner you get a drink - ok but when myself and other people asked for another drink the cabin staff never returned even when asked several times. Breakfast was even worse. My TV entertainment system did work for about 10 minutes then it packed up. The people sitting next to me did better - theirs lasted 40 minutes and packed up. Reported it to the crew that it was not working they tried for 2 hours and kept saying we are trying to fix it. Landed in Sao Paulo after a 12 hour flight still not working. One very long journey with nothing to do. Good luck to anyone going to the Olympics in 2016. I would say to people pay the extra and go with another airline. If you want to put a complaint into TAM don't bother they don't respond and give you the run around from department to department and you end up where you started. Save your time and money and don't bother complaining.

### "price was right"
Flights were very close to on time, cabin service was good, IFE on the Boeing 767 was good. No luggage problems. AEP airport in Buenos Aires is a zoo. Was concerned about the lengthy connection times until I realized that we could access the Admirals' Club lounges using the lifetime membership I bought in 76. Lounge in Toronto was ok, JFK very worn, GRU was wonderful with a great selection of food and wines. All in, the price was right.

### "crew were sitting in our seats "
Travelled domestically on TAM from GRU-MAO in 'Relax' Business class on the A330 We were in seats 1D/1G, the seats were situated in the first class compartment of plane, which has just 4 seats. These were full flat beds and very comfortable, the cabin was quite dated and shabby, carpet all frayed and very dirty, and the seats were quite tatty. Upon boarding the cabin crew were sitting in our seats and seemed quite miffed that we'd been assigned the seats and that had to move. Cabin service was awful onboard, within 10 mins of seatbelt sign being released the crew came through offering a small cheese bun and a soft drink, they were not seen again for the remainder of the 4hour flight. Entertainment was okay but not as good as the 767 we travelled out on Flight was on time and actually arrived about 15 mins early.

### "cabin clean, crew attentive"
Sao Paulo to Buenos Aires with TAM Airlines. On time depature and arrival. Cabin clean, crew attentive. Simple breakfast served in a bag, plenty of juices, coffee, etc. Cockpit announcements on take off and landing. Had to deplane by bus, but probably the fault of the chaotic airport. Too much carry on bagagge allowed and not enough space. Why can´t the airline staff at the boarding gate do something about it?

### "service dismal and uninterested"
Miami to San Paulo with TAM Airlines. Chaotic boarding at Miami. Every single passenger had three and four carry on items and nobody could care less. Thus ensued discussions, some strong, among passengers over bin space. Crew could not have cared less. Delayed departure due to catering issue and subsequent delayed arrival. IFE was not working all the time, had to be rebooted. Service dismal and uninterested. The food was acceptable, drinks difficult to get refilled. Not impressed, even though I have flown other TAM flights and have enjoyed them. Not this one.

### "Very sad attitude"
Despite the fact that I was holding a Business Class ticket GIG-GRU-ZRH-CDG, as there was no Business Class seats on the aircraft, I was refused access to Business Class check-in, I had to queue 30 mins at Economy Class check-in, and I was not even offered a Comfort Class seat. Very sad attitude. Probably due to the fact that GRU-ZRH-CDG was not flown on TAM. Short flight with soft drinks. Late on departure, late on arrival.

### "consistent on domestic flights"
Rio SDU to Brasilia on 13 November. Check in quick and breezed thru security. Boarding was delayed 45 minutes for a security issue on the plane. As I don't speak Portuguese it was hard to figure out what was the issue. The gate agents didn't speak much English but I figured out from talking to others what was going on. Friendly attendants on 1 hour 35 min flight. Snack served and drinks twice. Seats are tight but I'm 5'8 so managed ok. Landed 20 minutes late and bag was off quickly. Decent flight, and TAM is pretty consistent on domestic flights in Brazil - delays but no cancellations at least.

### "service is more appalling"
Manaus to Recife, returning Salvador da Bahia to Manaus, It is 2015 and their service is more appalling than ever, staff still unable to speak another language than Portuguese, several foreign travelers seeking information were dismissed by the staff. Planes are new and cabin recently renovated, they no longer serve sandwiches, just some toasts with soft drinks, sometimes they don't serve anything, even on flights longer than 2 hours. They are now cheaper than their competitors, most of the time. I was surprised that all flights left on time, that's something rare for TAM. Will fly them again, but only If I don't have a choice.

### "excellent from start to finish"
New York JFK to Rio de Janeiro with TAM, and excellent from start to finish. Online check in was smooth - connected from AA flight from ORD and bags tagged all the way to Rio.AAdmirals lounge at JFK was a warm welcome from everyone Gate agent for TAM friendly and personable,  boarding a mess but that is typical of flights to Brazil. Boeing 767-300 Business cabin was very nice - just like LAN (which makes sense since they basically own TAM) - seats are fully lay-flat and have plenty of room. AVOD is excellent with movies, TV and music selections. Flight attendants were smiling and assisting passengers. Dinner was high quality steak and veggies, salad, starter and ice cream to finish it off. Landed on time and immigration was quick. I was nervous as I hadn't flown TAM except within South America - but I would pick them over AA/UA/DL/CM/AV anytime going.

### "service is absolutely poor"
The service offered by TAM is absolutely poor. The booking process is difficult particularly if you are a foreigner and hasn't got the TAM Fidelidade,  and on top of it if you select a different language you pay a higher or lower price and also its pricing policy is confusing changing almost on a daily basis despite the fact that you are flying from and to the same airport. It does not give you the possibility to select a proper meal if you hold their frequent flyer card and you fly in economy class eventually you risk not have food for you as generally they run out to the choices offering you the left over. That happened to me twice this year because I tend to seat back at the end. Their inflight entertainment is not far from the other airlines although their touch screen hardly works. Forget about Duty Free, they apply rates in USD$ despite the fact the Brazilian currency is real, much cheaper, therefore the exchange rate applied is exorbitant. The crew is okay but some of them give out the impression to be afraid to speak out.

### "cabin crews helpful and cheerful"
London to Rio de Janeiro via Sao Paulo. This is my first time flying with TAM. Ground staff informed that I needed to recheck-in my luggage on arrival at Sao Paulo for my final destination at Rio de Janeiro. My connecting flight was just over 2 hours but due to a delay from LHR to GRU, it was only 1 hour and 45 mins to catch my next flight out. The good news was domestic check in from international connections was just beside the arrival hall at terminal 3 before proceeding to terminal 2. After boarding, was given toffee sweets which was a nice gesture. Amenity kit which includes socks, comb and pen were provided. The seats were fine but are cramped in comparison with Cathay and Singapore Airlines as the seating configuration for TAM's B777 is 10 across. Food was delicious. Inflight entertainment good but there was limited choices of movies and TV series. Throughout the 12 hour flight, rarely see the cabin crew offering drinks or food in between meals. Cabin crews were nevertheless, helpful and cheerful to serve the passengers.

### "incompetent airline"
I can't ever recall a more incompetent airline. TAM Airlines made changes to our reservation and I needed to organise a flight change that suited our schedule. I called the toll free number in the US to do this and reached a TAM/LAN service centre. Remarkably they told me that the representative works for LAN, not TAM, and that there is nobody available that can speak English to handle the matter. I then called Brasil to resolve the problem, and I did get an agent who speaks English however the agent has no authority to change tickets (she works for LAN and is based in Colombia), and she created a case number and told me someone from TAM would call me within six hours. No phone call received within three weeks. Also worth mentioning I am Oneworld Emerald, which of course makes no difference to anyone in TAM. This airline does not deserve to be in Oneworld. No question every new booking in Brasil will be with Azul, which is easy, comfortable, user friendly and is the jetBlue of Brasil.

### "pre-assigned seat has changed"
Santiago to London via Sao Paulo with TAM. A lovely new lounge at Sao Paulo. The TAM Airlines inflight service and food was very good. What really annoys me about TAM though is that every time, with no exception, when checking in online, I find my pre-assigned seat has been changed for no apparent reason. I've just checked in for my return flight and found that once again the seat has been changed.

### "they did a pretty good job"
I flew from Asuncion to Buenos Aires in Economy Class. It was my first flight with TAM and I have to say that they did a pretty good job. I have read so many bad reviews of TAM, but in my case everything went absolutely fine. The boarding process was one of the most efficient I've seen. The crew was very friendly and I felt extremely safe on board, too. The flight was on time. Next time I'm in South America, I'll definitely try to fly TAM again.

### "the most dysfunctional airline "
TAM Airlines is the most dysfunctional airline I have ever encountered anywhere in the world. On many trips through Brazil, I have flown TAM with relatively few headaches. However, in September 2015, my opinion has changed drastically. In short: their website is dysfunctional and buggy. They don't have English speaking phone support. And, even worse, their website lists ticket offices in Rio de Janeiro that don't exist anymore. It's impossible to change or re-book a ticket without horrendous, time-wasting hassles and expensive overseas phone calls to Brazilian numbers. TAM has no telephone support in English to assist with basic needs - like re-ticketing. You must call a LAN phone number to request an English speaker, and then wait for someone to call you back. In my case, I waited more than three days for someone to call me. Emails to Customer Service went unanswered (and a phone rep later told me that their Customer Service department responds to emails "within thirty days. I'm not kidding.) And although they replied via Twitter, they would only direct me to the same phone service that could provide what I needed - a changed ticket. In the midst of this frustration, I decided to visit a Ticket Office in person. I spent an hour to travel to an address that's currently listed on the TAM website for a ticket office in Ipanema. After arriving, I found a sign on the door saying that they had moved - and the new office location was closed that day (a Saturday). Infuriating. If you're an overseas traveler who is traveling in Brazil, and you don't speak Portuguese, I strongly suggest that you fly another airline. TAM's horror stories are plentiful, and until they make major systemic changes, I won't be flying them again.

### "satisfied with the service provided"
Toronto to New York with TAM Airlines, and overall satisfied with the service provided. I used TAM given their competitive price, baggage allowance and reluctance to use Air Canada. The flights were on time, 1 hour flight time each way. Comfortable seating in Economy with a small snack service. Impressed with the cleanliness of the cabin and newness of aircraft. Speedy delivery of luggage at both airports. One thing I did not understand is why they wait so long to depart when everyone is seated and cargo hold closed. The cabin was a bit on the cool side as several people put on their jacket. I plan to use them again for my subsequent nyc trips.

### "Onboard .. TAM were very charming and efficient"
TAM administration is a disaster: took 3 weeks to establish what a schedule change was because the phone number provided is for LAN who must raise a 'file number' to any TAM query and revert (at their leisure). I am a OneWorld Emerald card holder - TAM do not, despite what their website says and what One World 'rules' say, acknowledge fast track departures. At Madrid people were being processed at fast Track, I had walk all the way back to join a very crowded general line. They do not extend extra baggage allowance beyond 2 pieces @23kg each. These 'gifts' are only for TAM privileges on their own card system. Onboard the flights TAM were very charming and efficient. Some of the nicest flight attendants around. Boeing 767 has flat seats, not overly comfortable in bed position (thin blanket and pillow too) but a nice roomy and accommodating cabin. Pretty good selection of movies on demand on a decent size bright screen. Food looked good but it was midnight so I didn't eat. Breakfast orders taken to order and served as per. Too bad their ground work is heading the way of LAN (who seem to work for the convenience of their employees more than anyone else)

### "was our last flight with TAM"
First flight with TAM Airlines, last flight with TAM. Check in was fine, fast check in. Waiting for the flight another plan had difficulties at the bay, so delay by 50 minutes. Asked if the connection in Rio will be possible. Supervisior asked me to rebook my flight from Rio to a TAM flight, instead of LH leaving from São Paulo for a day later. Of course we missed the connection flight, because our priority luggage come out 25 minutes after the first luggage showed up. Talking to the TAM representative for a solution, he was not responsible. Referred to another colleague. Was just a waste of time, no offer for reimbursement. To be honest, this was our last flight with TAM.

### "I was impressed"
TAM airlines is the only form of transportation I have come across in Brasil that is on time. I was impressed when I checked in and was transferred to an earlier flight that was already boarding. I was impressed at the efficiency. I boarded the earlier flight and was surprised that my luggage came on the same flight. They also had an English speaker so I didn't have to struggle with my Portuguese in explaining the situation.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Business Class service is equal to Economy Class on other airlines serving Brazil from Europe and USA. Service was fast, only one time drinks were offered and cabin staff disappeared for most of the flight. Talking with one Flight Attendant she told me that after LAN took over TAM, the airline is going down, employees are unhappy. She even suggest me to take Lufthansa the next time!

### TAM Airlines customer review
I had flown with TAM in several occasions and I had a good experience before, I can't say the same in this case, their customer service is awful, we had to wait one hour in the business check in counters because nobody was there. After one hour there they told us that our flight which was international had to be attended in the domestic flights area, and after another half an hour waiting there, they weren't able to introduce our rewards card into the system. I don't why but after almost two hours trying to make the check in we only wanted to leave. Worst ground service ever.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Worst longhaul flight I've had in a long time. Firstly my LAN-partner flight from Salta to B.A. was delayed by an hour, making me miss my connection (the flight should have been earlier, and the delay would have not harmed me, but the flight time was changed after I booked) so I was delayed by 24 hours. The next day's flight from B.A. to Sao Paulo was also delayed, with at first no annoucement at all (we had already boarded), then very late an announcement with differing details in Portuguese, Spanish and English, then an announcement that we would be offloading some passengers to re-book which turned out to be correct. Very chaotic, and the crew disappeared during this time. Finally I did make my final connection, and on this one (the 12-hour flight), my entertainment system didn't work, this included my call button, so I couldn't even get assistance and the crew didn't bring around drinks once during the entire flight (except with the 2 meal services). My initial flight from Frankfurt to Sao Paulo had also been cancelled, but here I was lucky to get re-boked on a LH flight. I will never fly with TAM again.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Flight JJ8020 from Rio de Janeiro to Santiago. To call it a business class is a gross exaggeration. To begin with, with a flight departure at 07.04am, the lounge was not open until 06.15 when they began boarding for the flight. On board, no welcome drink, a broken seat (luckily the seat next to mine was available, so I could move) and a cabin crew that were more interested to talk to each other than to welcome boarding passengers. After take-off, again the cabin crew spent most of their time closing the curtain between the business class and the galley. Breakfast was reasonable and had a choice of a platter of cold cuts and a hot omelette. After that, no more spontaneous drink service for a 4.5 hour flight. Selection of the press very poor and no individual entertainment system. The aircraft was old and looked and felt old. Very indifferent service.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Our flight to Sao Paulo, Brasil was delayed in Miami for 8 hrs. We arrived and had to wait at the airport - 3 hrs at ticket counter to get a replacement for the connecting flight, meantime our bags were picked up and it took me another hour to find them. We were given a voucher for a hotel and they told us to wait for the hotel shuttle. Shuttle didn't come and we had to get a cab. Got to Foz at 2am. Lost one day of my vacation. On the way back, we were told that our reservations had been cancelled and that we had to stay in a hotel again. I made a scene at the airport and finally after 2 hrs of yelling back and forth, they found my reservation.

### TAM Airlines customer review
TAM Airlines from Guarulhos-GRU to Orlando-MCO. The flight, in general, was good. The food was good, so was the space between my legs and the seat in front of me. The flight attendants were kind. I would fly again!

### TAM Airlines customer review
Flight was departing Foz do Iguaçu (IGU) with 2 hrs delay. Cabin service lousy, they were not serving even coffee. One hour in the flight we have been informed that due to the lack of fuel and heavy traffic in Sao Paulo we have to fly back to Foz do Iguaçu. After arrival in Foz the plane has been refueled with all passengers staying aboard and after some 40 min leaving again for Sao Paulo. Most of the PA in Foz do Iguaçu and on the way was only in Portuguese, not in English. We have been translated relevant info by our fellow passenger. On our second trip to Sao Paulo nothing has been offered, not even water. Cabin crew was not present having a rest in the aft of the plane. All PAs before landing has been made by Captain in Portuguese and not translated to English - and not a word of apology. During this flight just everything went wrong. I have never experienced such a bad service. Note, the price of the air ticket was approx 300 US$, not a cheap one for 1.5 hrs domestic flight. Terrible experience.

### TAM Airlines customer review
I made my reservations on LANs website, I flew from Rosario to Miami via Sao Paulo and back. All the flights were excellent, Comfortable seats, pretty good inflight service and such an excellent crew and ground staff. I would definitely fly with TAM again.

### TAM Airlines customer review
I flew business class with TAM recently from London to Sao Paulo and back. Fortunately this was paid for by the people who invited me to lecture in Brasilia because if I had been paying I would not have been happy. The seating arrangements were reasonable but the service was poor at best and the food was sub-economy standard on most airlines. The poor service include having to ask for most things and not being offered anything (like drinks) more than once several mistakes on the breakfast order non-availability of several food items on the menus generally morose staff etc etc. This was really poor TAM - you are letting your country down and you need to get your act together with the Olympics looming fast!

### TAM Airlines customer review
GRU-MVD on Jan. 4 MVD-GRU-FLN on Jan 14 and FLN-GIG on Jan 18 all segments in Economy and on A320s all planes fairly fresh and clean except for GRU-MVD which was on a very tired A320 and outright dirty obviously not cleaned and with trash in the seat pockets. All flights on time or early service in the air generally fine with FAs ranging from just pleasant to attentive and good. While service as such was ok for economy standards there is a distinct decline of service quality noticeable over the years also with JJ in addition it seems the take-over from LAN did not really help. Seats on the international sectors were significantly more comfortable than the ones on the domestic legs where JJ uses the uncomfortable Recaro slim seats however as leg room was ok it was fine for the short domestic sections. On the morning GRU-MVD flight a tasty muffin on the afternoon return flight MVD-GRU an inedible cheese and ham sandwich was served no food on the domestic segments just a small pack of salty snacks one drink round on all legs (including beer) but additional drinks were served on request with a smile. Web check-in went smooth with no or short lines at the premium check-in counters all check-in staff very friendly except for GRU where the agent seemed just tremendously annoyed didn't say a word after the initial contact and was more interested in chewing her gum than dealing with us. The main negative event of the flights was the transfer in GRU on our way from MVD to FLN. While the flight into GRU was 20 minutes early and border control was efficient and fast it took 70 minutes for the luggage to arrive which has to be picked up in GRU and rechecked after customs (same as in the US or Canada). Priority bags were out last. Also JJ uses T3 for international and T2 for domestic flights with no direct shuttles between those terminals. The shuttle goes from T3 to T4 to T1 and finally to T2. So after a 15 minutes wait for the shuttle it took us a further 30 minutes to arrive at T2. Although we had a connection time of more than 2 hours and were 20 minutes early into GRU we barely made our connection flight. In general ground service from JJ at GRU was abysmal. As for lounges we only used the one in MVD which was elegant comfortable and spacious enough but had just a limited drink selection and very limited food offerings as we were short in time we didn't visit the lounge in GRU. So overall mostly good flights which delivered us on time with no problems aside from the transfer in GRU. Recommended but I would be careful with connecting through GRU. (Oneworld Sapphire).

London-Sao Paulo. An interesting comparison with colleagues who were on the BA flight on the same route and time. Check in quick and easy at Heathrow's now almost deserted Terminal 1 (soon to close for rebuilding) but a long walk to actually embark at Terminal 2. Economy similar to most airlines. TAM give you a little pack containing socks toothbrush etc. which most airlines seem to have stopped. Food OK though they were a little ungenerous with the drinks. It would have been nice if they had come round with water overnight. Good selection of entertainment though not as up-to-date as some. Flight from Sao Paulo left late as do most flights from Sao Paulo in my experience.

Flying a domestic flight - almost 5 hours - from Sao Paulo to Belem doesn't give the passenger the right to request a pillow or blanket - after my own experience I got the answer that they were just for International flights. As a frequent flyer I had never experienced that before I frequently fly with Qantas on a short flight 1 hr 45 mins duration where I have a pillow and blanket as well hot meal for main meals or a decent lunch in between.

EZE-GIG one-way in Business class. Very early departure from EZE. Check-in took longer than needed as the staff seemed very chatty amongst themselves. Security was very fast and they did not mind that I brought my water through. Lounge was ok but basic. Aircraft was a reasonable A32x. On board it is 2x2 old style recliners which is much better than regional business class in Europe which is usually 3x3 with free middle seat. Due to the early departure I went straight to sleep but woke up for breakfast which was ok. Then some more sleep. Landed on time in Rio. Immigration had about 30 people ahead of me as one of the US originated planes had landed earlier. Bags were ready when I reached the baggage area. Easy customs as they did not seem to want to scan anyone that day. Would choose TAM again on this route as the only other airline offering business is Emirates which gets to Rio past midnight.

Flew from GRU to SCL on 4 January Seat 2A. Quick efficient check in. Flight was on a seemingly older A320. Cabin crew were polite and attentive kept filling up drinks meal was OK. No individual IFE screen - only 2 screens for the three rows of Business Class. Seat only partially reclined - made sleep difficult but only a 4 hour flight. Expect more for International Business Class.

Flight Puerto Seguro - Sao Paulo. The flight was planned for 2 hours in time for the connection from GRU to LHR. However half way through the plane circled for a long time while a heavy thunderstorm raced around. After one hour we landed in Rio De Janeiro which was only announced in Portuguese. Nothing in English which was surprising as English is regarded the main language in the airline world. Eventually we were on the ground for 3 hours lost our connection flight and during 3 hours only offered a glass of water from a crew which found more fun in entertaining themselves (and a few passengers) than explaining what was going on. For safety reasons it is OK to delay but information should be announced in main languages. When in GRU we were offered hotel and food and one-way taxi and was booked on next day flight to Europe. Rather slow but with good service from the staff in GRU.

### TAM Airlines customer review
No organization at check-in no proper boarding English announcements poor and service onboard is lacking. This is ignoring the absurd seats in the A320 in Business Class. It's reach for the global market is somewhat hampered if year after year they keep getting what the passenger wants wrong. Check-in for this GRU-MVD flight was one big fat holiday queue with cardholders business passengers and the poor souls who thought they were avoiding big lines by checking in online included. Why bother buying premium or using more miles or checking in TAM's subpar website before the airport rush? This mess continues at boarding. The agent was ghastly and barked at us. As for our bags they were ticketed on a different flight for reasons I am yet to understand. Lastly drinks were scant and food was dreadful and inappropriate for the flight. I added an extra star for the trip satisfaction only because despite all of that the quiet Business cabin was exactly that.

LHR to EZE via GRU. One way economy return in business. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the plane the food and the staff. The staff were very pleasant both ways. They don't constantly offer you drinks as you might get in BA but I could never afford business in BA. The lounge at EZE is good. Get drinks food wifi. The lounge at GRU is very busy but I had a great shower there. Totally flat bed in business. Economy was just standard as you would get anywhere. I would definitely fly TAM again.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Travelling between LHR and MVD for the Christmas holidays and back again. Original outbound night flight was cancelled which I discovered because I couldn't complete online check-in. I contacted my agent - they hadn't been informed of any cancellation. I then spent two hours on the phone to the TAM enquiries before being informed that the flight was in fact cancelled. Staff were rude ill-informed and unhelpful. The reason eventually given was mechanical failure. Flight was rescheduled for the next morning at 8 am. Once at Sao Paulo there was a further delay as once the plane was ready to take off the crew had just exceeded the number of hours they were allowed to fly. Return flight was on December 31st. Failure of the air-con system left us stuck on the plane for over an hour before being informed we would have to disembark and board another plane once it was ready. There was no further information within the airport and no apology from the airline no water pr refreshments provided and little help for those travelling with children. Due to land at LHR at 1.15pm on the 1st. Arrived at 6.15 pm. TAM proved itself entirely unreliable on both the outbound and inbound flight. I would have happily paid more for a flight which had managed to maintain its schedule.

Flew from SCL to GRU on B777 Seat 7K. Was in transit from Sydney so check in was not applicable. Flight delayed about 1 hour leaving Santiago with few updates as to reason. Flight crew were very polite friendly and hospitable. Menu variety was limited but most people would have been catered for. Wine selection very good with excellent choices from Chile Argentina and Europe. Seat is comfortable but is the inclined flat bed of which I am not a fan of. Most top quality airlines should have lie flat beds. Storage areas were large as too was the legroom. Overall a very pleasant experience.

### TAM Airlines customer review
EZE to GRU in business class on 330 Airbus. Seat recline worked intermittently and IFE had to be constantly rebooted so it was impossible to watch anything. No apologies from staff. No announcement made on arrival of the local time and we had a connecting flight and I hadn't noted that Brazil was an hour ahead of Argentina. Business lounges are not of the same standard as other Oneworld carriers. At GRU we changed planes 777-300 to LHR. Staff on this flight were more attentive and courteous. IFE worked but volume level at max was still too quiet. Breakfast order is taken in advance and nicely presented. Business seat was long enough for me but not for husband whose feet were trapped under the seat in front. I found the seat to be hard. Not bad quality for price paid.

GRU-GIG-GRU. Flew from Sao Paulo to Rio. Domestic cabin crew do not speak English. No English announcements. Flight delayed from GRU. If it wasn't for a gentleman sitting next to me I would not know the reason. I wrote a feedback to the airline to tell then my experience and there answer was " In Brazil there's no law that says that English announcements have to be made on domestic flights. Very surprised.

Sao Paulo (Congonhas) - Belo Horizonte. Early morning flight seat factor: 100%. New and clean Airbus A319. Nice and smiling cabin crew. A tasty sandwich offered for breakfast along with coffee tea and other cold beverages. Flight attendants did speak very good English. The ticket was not cheap but worth what I paid. Overall a pleasant experience. Took off on time and did land in BH 20 minutes ahead of schedule.

### TAM Airlines customer review
We flew from Heathrow via San Paulo to Lima and returned via Madrid to Heathrow during a package holiday to Peru and I have to say having read some of the reviews that we had very pleasant flights. The planes seemed new to me were clean and comfortable and the food not bad for airline food. I was expecting the worse but all the tit bits I took just in case were not needed. We even had snacks on the internal flights and free drinks so can't complain. However I would advise taking your own supply of water as once dinner had been served and the lights dimmed for the over night flight we saw no sign of the cabin staff until breakfast. The staff never cracked a smile though I can't say they were unhelpful they just didn't seem particular keen and friendly. The only time we saw a smile is when they asked an elderly lady to move seats and then promptly sat an off duty air hostess in the vacated seat because there was an empty seat alongside! A lesson learned if I'm asked to move seats I want to know why I wouldn't mind for a family to be together but not for cabin crew to have a better seat. Saying all that I would fly TAM again! I have certainly flown in better but I have also flown worse so if cost is an issue or its part of a holiday package then don't worry too much. Happily our luggage was fine by the way even though we had connecting flights. Once checked in at Heathrow and on our return at Lima we didn't see it again until the end of flights.

JJ8043 MIA/BSB Boeing 767-300. Check-in was Ok! Lounge Ok too. Cabin crew looked tired and after the dinner service you hardly saw them they spent the whole time talking in the galley. Plane was new a previous LAN aircraft but cabin and business class seats already worn out. Cabin not very clean and did not smell nice like most of TAM aircraft's.

JJ 8027 SCL-GRU on 5 Sept. 777-300 in Business Class. Had never flown TAM on anything but domestic Brazil flights so wondered how the service would be. I was impressed. Flight attendants were very friendly and welcoming with smiles. 3.5 hour flight and was served a light dinner that was tasty. Seats are not fully flat but recline was comfortable and it would be fine for a trans-atlantic flight. AVOD was good - watched movies and TV shows. Pilot kept us informed of our progress. Landed and waited 20 min for a gate but that is typical at GRU - not TAM's fault. Bag was the 2nd one off - really enjoyed the flight.

### TAM Airlines customer review
JJ 8028 29 Aug 2014. What a shambolic airline. From the inability to check in online - webpage freezing up the lack of control at the GRU check in - 20 mins wait in the business class line one check in counter open and no control to ensure that only business class pax use the business class check in a mediocre lounge and a plane which was at least 40 years old - seats not much younger - still had functioning ashtrays! As for inflight service - poor! Old business class seats with little recline no individual TV and the old 10inch overhead screen food selection limited and all brought at the same time - so choose eat the cold starter and the main course gets cold eat main course first then starter or leave the starter - only one steward for the business class cabin so service also slow. Poor safety standards on landing: no check that seats were upright classes were left at the seats and not collected and even when staff were paged they did not resolve the issue.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Very disappointed and annoyed with TAM. We had bought a flight from Sucre to Santa Cruz via Cochabamba and had to be in Santa Cruz that afternoon for an evening engagement. The TAM flight left Sucre half an hour late (or more). this is ironic as all around the airports I was seeing posted saying Thanks for your punctuality and yet the airline itself felt it acceptable to be running so late. Because of this we missed the connection to Santa Cruz and the staff at the TAM desk were not very helpful. All they were concerned about was getting more money out of the customer by charging us to change the ticket to a later flight. This at least they should have done for free and been apologetic about the poor performance of their airline! Perhaps 200 Bolivianos is not a huge amount but it is the principle of it that has so annoyed us and made us not want to travel TAM again or recommend it to anyone.

Terrible Business Lounge in Sao Paulo. No wifi awful cold food (not good sandwiches) and uncomfortable seats harsh lighting. Once you're on the flight: Inattentive staff uncomfortable seats not good food and you're lucky if you get a glass of wine in the first 2 hours. I won't be flying with them again. Make BA look like saints.

GRU-EZE (JJ8000) - Airbus A330-200. I always flew TAM and they always provided a decent service and acceptable coach class seat comfort. But the last time they were able to transform a 2.5 hours flight in a nightmare! It was an early morning flight and my seat was 35K. The interesting thing is I had flown in the very same seat in the very same plane (PT-MVP) one year earlier from GRU to MIA and it was a pleasant flight! But this time they refurbished the interior and had shrunk the space between coach seats. I couldn't find a nice position to relax myself even it being a 2.5 hours flight. The catering was ridiculous just a very small cold tasteless ham and cheese sandwich a lot worse than they use to serve on Sao Paulo/Rio de Janeiro Shuttle Service. The flight attendant told me it was an early morning flight and called that stuff "breakfast" and told me the food in night flights on that route was a lot better. I took the night flight to come back and they gave the same small cold and tasteless sandwich! For the price they put in the ticket it should be a lot better. Coach Class used to be good but lately it's a nightmare not only at TAM but on all airlines I have flown.

### TAM Airlines customer review
I add this old comment out of interest to others. LHR to Sao Paulo Sao P to Salvador. Just a few minutes before scheduled take off - flight delayed by 14 hours! (gone tech). I risked loosing my sailing holiday. The TAM functionaire accompanied and assisted me to get my baggage off the plane and spent a lot of time and effort trying to help me. I say she went well beyond the call of duty! (This flight was delayed not by a fault of TAM but of BA who "stole" their slot!) Arriving at SP they tried to organise hotels for all the passengers. Returning to LHR plane half empty - we all got to stretch out - great sleep! the first and last time that will happen!!! All in all warmly recommend TAM - it is important to know the actual cause of the problem. (This is nearly always gross overcrowding both on the ground and in the air).

EZE-GRU-CDG in December. First leg on A330 rather comfortable due to wide bodied plane but catering disappointing: The usual ham/cheese croissant and cheap lemonades no coffee/tea service or beer on a 2.5 hrs scheduled international flight. GRU-CDG was pleasant due to a brand new 777 plane and despite the 3-4-3 layout in the economy cabin rather comfortable. The design of this aircraft was very stylish and all super clean almost luxurious. Inflight entertainment decent but again catering rather poor. At least wine and beer served plus coffee and a continental breakfast before landing. Due to low fare I was rather satisfied but would not like to spend more than the lowest fare because of the sub-par catering. Ground handling staff were very friendly while on board crew just professional but not unpleasant.

I'm a Lufthansa frequent flyer on the Sao Paulo-Frankfurt route but this time I decided to give TAM a try. Equipment was a Boeing 773. Seat factor: something between 95 and 100% mainly Brazilians onboard. Was pretty much impressed with the large quantity of movies and films available on the IFE. Cabin crew friendly did speak good English but I do agree with some previous reviews: too much talking and gossiping among them. Food quality was in my opinion better than Lufthansa but what a small portion I got for dinner! Good breakfast but no tea available. I found the seat more comfortable than LH: did especially appreciate the footrest each seat has. A small amenity kit was also a nice touch. At the end I have to say I was satisfied but Lufthansa will still be my first choice.

Flight booked form FRA to GRU. Planned departure 2200 hrs. After boarding completed the plane went on a hold position and all the passengers had to get out due to Frankfurt Airport Closure after 2300 hrs. The chaos was perfect! No information poor assistance. Brought us to a hotel in Darmstadt and back to the airport the following day. There - absolute chaos at the gate. Hundreds of people just a few and stressed out TAM staff. Got a comment that my LH frequent flyer status would not count anymore as TAM is now a Oneworld member although I had booked Lufthansa and this was a Lufthansa - operated by TAM - flight. Finally left on the following day. Seats very narrow! Plane totally worn out. Staff very unfriendly. Staff's priority surely were not the passengers! Staff standing in the pantry and having a good time with coffee and drinks reacting rude to any request for help or drinks. Conclusion: TAM - never again!

PZ 720 GRU-EZE. Business class in abysmal shape quite in sync with TAM overall performance. The seats are old without plugs with ashtrays in my case full of chewed gums and candy wrappings. Broken trays render the food service experience even more exciting especially when served without a menu. No welcome drink even after waiting 25 minutes before pulling out of the gate. Entertainment inexistent except blasting commercial advertisements on the main screens. Mediocrity is the best adjective to describe this service.

Flew MVD-SAO C class and then LH 1st class to FRA and TLV due to a mess AF made when arriving and departing late from MVD and thus not allowing me to check bags to TLV. I had to re-route my ticket on the spot through my travel agent and must say that TAM special service agents and staff are always fabulous. Ground staff were smiley putting me at ease as usual and checking me through no problems at all unlike AF "don't care attitude". Since TAM became LANTAM not so good. but the spirit of pax first is there. Flight MVD to SAO fine on board and I was then looked after by LH 1st class team on arrival in SAO. I think TAM is great both on the ground and on board. Shame they will discontinue first class. but bravo again! will recommend!

JFK-GIG. B767-300. Flat beds. One of the worst Business Class flight of my life on all aspects. 1) Check-in: slow because some passengers from Economy with "friends" (TAM employees) were driven directly to Business class counter. 2) Departure was delayed 70 mins. 3)nCabin attendants did not stop gossiping in the galley all night long. 4) We had to take our pillows and blankets from the luggage bins. 5) No printed menu. 6) Food was cold ugly and just impossible to consume. 7) Any request was treated with an ugly face as if to say:" why are you bothering me".

JFK-GRU-LHR. Unable to get on any US carrier out or BA back I had no choice but to go TAM. I'd flown previously with them within Latin America and hoped things would be better long haul. Now Oneworld they have a lot to do to meet that standard. At JFK they didn't recognise my Emerald status. Eventually got into the right American lounge usual there. The plane boarded very late. But with no announcements so 90 mins at the gate standing. Queues were chaotic. Lots of staff ignoring passengers. On board got champagne just as well as we waited a further 50mins to take off. They held the flight for two very late passengers in Business class. Surprised me until when they arrived it was obvious that they were off duty crew! Seats are very poor. Not only do they go nowhere near 180 degrees but they are far from flat. Extremely uncomfortable. If you end up in the middle seat of three you are in for a very bad flight indeed. AVOD screen large but they should have spent the money on seats. Food mediocre. GRU the usual chaos on landing late. On the London leg the lounge at GRU is appalling. Nowhere near enough seats for everyone few sockets for chargers. Many people standing like it was a bar. Too hot. Drinks selection OK. Boarded late again after a lengthy wait standing. On board experience similar. I fly long haul 50+ times per year. Ok I am careful about which airlines I use but this as bad a Business Class long haul experience as I have had. TAM not a patch on LAN. Avoid if you can.

Flight JJ8064 Sao Paolo to Madrid March 30th 2014. Having read some very poor reviews we were a little nervous when our agent recommended this flight. However we were pleasantly surprised. Staff were friendly and helpful the food was not quite up to LAN standards but more than acceptable and served with some very nice wines. The seats were not quite lie-flat but comfortable enough and we were given nice duvets and pillows. The little flight pack was well put together and useful - especially the warm socks! Business Class lounge in Sao Paolo was OK not great and we gave up trying to connect to the Wifi! It was nice and quiet though. The flight arrived 30mins early in Madrid and the bags arrived quickly. They have a bit of a way to go to catch up with LAN but would say that they are getting there!

Business class from LHR to GIG on September 28th 2013. It was a very bad flight mainly because of the worst crew I have seen. This crew were arrogant incompetent with inadequate behavior. As soon as we got the plane there was no welcome. They did not give us blankets and pillows we had to ask for it. When they start serving the dinner they brought everything on the same tray. Starters soup and main dish and of course when we started the main dish it was already cold. No dessert coffee tea offered. Just after they served dinner a small bit of turbulence began the seat belt sign was turned on. Turbulence last for about 5 minutes time for the crew stop the service and started their own dinner leaving everything on the tables. I have been complaining about this flight because it was an absurd. The crew are paid for doing their job. I will never choose TAM again mainly because of the way they handle the service I got.

Return trip LHR-SAO-SCL. 3 April. Positive points: excellent service from check in and flight attendants. Courteous and keen to please. Food OK and served shortly after take off. Personally I like the beds that don't go completely flat although I know its not to everyone's taste. Lounge in LHR is the star alliance one with lots of room and good selection of snacks and drinks. Negative points: Lounge in terminal 1 SAO was getting pretty full at only 06.45. Same complaint as on the outward trip. On both outbound and return trips bread and tea/coffee was only offered once with the meal. Extra was available with no problem but its a hassle having to ask for it. I've done 8 flights with them over the last 4 months most in business and whilst there are still things to improve to bring to LAN standards I reckon TAM is good value for money.

Flight 8008 GRU-AEP 22/03/2014. Flight portion purchased in Business class. At the last minute before boarding time passengers were advised that due to equipment change C class would not be offered. Due to this late announcement gate agents were unable (or not willing) to process a downgrade refund and guaranteed me that AEP ground staff would handle my request. Obviously after my arrival in Buenos Aires I was not surprised to see that the office was already closed 20 minutes prior to our landing. Service in Y class inept with a mushy and cold sandwich and a soft drink in a plastic glass. Managed to get an MCO re-issued the next morning. Mediocre flight service and appalling ground services overall.

SCL-SAO-LHR 24 March. Lounge in SCL is of LAN hence excellent in all respects. Snack to SAO not up to international standards but edible. Airports in Brazil are all of low standards so not worth commenting on. However as many others have reported the business class lounge in SAO is really unacceptable. It is well decorated with a good selection of snacks and drinks but only enough room for about 20 people sitting. I had a 4 hour layover and found there wasn't enough space to even have a cup of coffee standing up! It was unbearable with people standing in the reception blocking entry and exit. It was the same as the situation outside in the public areas so no alternative but to squeeze into a corner and wait. With LAN channelling passengers through SAO on routes to Europe this problem must be resolved or alternative airlines will no doubt be used. SAO-LHR excellent inflight service with very attentive flight attendants and very good IFE. Food was OK well presented but could be improved to LAN standards. To be fair TAM fares are much cheaper than other airlines so we cant be too demanding. I've used TAM a lot within S America over the last year and will continue.

### TAM Airlines customer review
BRU-FRA-SAO-MVD 1st class on transatlantic and c on regional legs as no F available. Tam is a good both on board and on ground company. Their 1st class is only one row of four in both 340 and 777 planes. A little tatty and getting old but all in all the service is rather good especially ground services which pick you up from gate and take you to lounges. Quality quantity and drinks is too local and little international but staff are attentive will fly them again.

Someone had mention in reviews that it was too cold during the flight. Well it should be an advantage Our flight from London to Sao Paulo was a nightmare due to lack of air conditioning on. I prefer to wrap in blankets and extra clothes rather than not having any air at all. We asked staff several times to turn it on but nothing happened. Staff were very friendly though good entertainment panel.

My trip began in Salvador to Rio. Salvador airport is utter chaos due to construction. Took a while to get checked in. Plane was an Airbus 320 single class very tight seats and lamentable catering. The Rio NY flight on former LAN 767 was paradise in comparison. The flat seats are substantially better then the usual lie flat TAM fare. Food was good yet unfortunately it was exactly the same menu as the incoming NY-Rio flight. I am sure TAM can do better. The soup option was good yet on both segments it was too cold: not good to have soup on a typical Business cart. Better to take a bit more time and serve it directly from the galley. Staff were cordial yet tended to disappear after dinner was over. Arrived on time and baggage was waiting.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Flew back from Sao Paulo with TAM (having also flown out to Sao Paulo from Heathrow with them). As usual a number of issues. Firstly it wouldn't let us check in online instead confirming that we were on stand-by. Naturally this caused us concerns so we enquired on arrival at Sao Paulo to be told that this was because when we flew out to Sao Paulo we paid extra for exit seats. So essentially they inconvenienced us just so they could try to upsell these exit seats again. Thank you TAM. The check-in clerk was very friendly anyway so that was good. Boarding was utter chaos. The time between boarding starting and the plane starting to taxi was two hours! I don't remember ever having had a flight like it. The seats were hideously uncomfortable as ever and the IFE extremely limited unless you wish to watch hundreds of episodes of Downton Abbey. The crew was alright but expressed the usual bemusement about my partner's veggie meal. Landed slightly early and TAM's ground crew took forever to get the bags off.

Flew Heathrow to Sao Paulo and then a week later Sao Paulo to Montevideo. First flight was awful. Paid nearly £90 each just for the privilege of an exit seat. Didn't sleep well all the same as plane was freezing cold all the way. Crew were just about polite but nothing more and certainly no engagement. They spent the time during what I assume would have been the safety briefing chatting in the galley. I normally love airline food and am easily impressed typically devouring everything I am given but both my meals were disgraceful attempts at food and if it wasn't for the fact that we got such measly catering on a 12 hour flight I would've left most of it. The crew vanished after the meal service not even returning with more drinks or even water. IFE is about 20 years behind other major airlines so quite depressing on such a long flight. Having paid extra for exit seats there was then nowhere to stow books and magazines etc. The short haul flight was no better. A pre announced 40 minute delay turned into a 2 hour delay with no explanation and little updating along the way. In fact while we were waiting in the lounge our flight disappeared from the gate screen altogether again with no explanation. The 'meal' was a very unpleasant cheese and ham croissant. Really a horrible airline. On the Heathrow to Sao Paulo journey which my partner and I undertake regularly we will opt for BA next time which is better by a country mile and not normally much more expensive.

11 Dec flights 3311 and 8028 economy. Attention at the airports and on board was excellent. TAM is really improving. Food was the normal cheese and ham sandwich to GRU then a better snack with a better sandwich GRU to SCL. What was nice was the attendants passed by 3 times offering drinks something unusual but very welcome in economy. I also like the attention paid to safety on board as the crew were far more conscious of it than on other airlines. For example we were not allowed to sit in emergency exit rows as we didn't speak Portuguese. I would have thought that speaking English would be good enough but I understand their point. Also there was a lot of turbulence across the Andes and they constantly reminded people to sit down which is also welcome. I'm liking more this airline the more I choose them.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Appalling customer service. We fly all over the world and had booked our business class flights via Sao Paulo however one leg of the journey was in economy as there was no availability of business class. On advice of the airline we booked a seat with extra leg room and made the payment. A few weeks later we were told those seats may no longer be available and they would not be able to tell us until the actual day of the journey. Moreover we would not be automatically be reimbursed unless requested. It is unbelievable that you do not get an automatic pay back where a service is not offered by the company I am horrified at the lack of professionalism.

Although LAN and TAM are theoretically now one airline they continue to operate as before except I do find their check in and on time performances have improved. The food on TAM however is far inferior to that of LAN. I recently went Santiago to Sao Paulo then on to Natal with TAM and on both flights was served the same ham and cheese sandwich. One flight did offer wine which I strongly recommend others don't try. It was like some kind of very sugary grape juice not like on LAN where you actually get a decent wine even in economy.

GRU-EZE-SSA JJ8019/3170 Nov 16 2013. No respect whatsoever for Business class paying passengers on their domestic Brazilian flight portions. No matter if you are inbound/outbound TAM makes a point not providing you basic attention regardless of your International Business class fare. Forget Premium seating on the Domestic flights forget early boarding. They gladly sell you on top of a Premium Business class fare a bulkhead seat for an extra R$ 30.00!

Santiago-Sao Paulo in economy. No major issues during the flight. Left on time and arrived ahead of time. Service was acceptable. The problem started once landed in Sao Paulo. As the flight arrived early there were no fingers ready so waited for 20 minutes before docking and an extra hour to collect my luggage as the aircraft ended up docking in a "different" finger. This is not a TAM issue it is the airport issue. The Tam part of the journey was ok.

### TAM Airlines customer review
TAM long haul business class is below standards of international airlines. The seat is about average but the service is really poor. I would rather fly a European airline in Economy Premium (such as AF or BA) than flying TAM on Business Class. The dinner service is really mediocre: everything is served at once in a tray - so the main dish gets cold while you are eating the first course. There is no choice of appetizers before dinner. The personnel on board does not seem to understand what are the expectations of business class customers. The cost benefit is very bad.

IGU-GIG. Boarding was a bit chaotic but other than that the cabin was in good shape crew attentive if asked. Nothing special but an OK flight. Took off and landed on time so not much more to ask for. Our luggage on the other hand took almost as long as the flight to get to us after. Don't think this is TAM's fault but was a bad ending.

JJ3558 IGU-GRU 16 Oct 2013. Fly this route usually every month. TAM is dropping the quality of service and it shows. Should be considered a low cost airline and not a standard airline. At check in we were almost forced to do self check in seats with more space are sold separately and until last month they served a mini sandwich with 3 choices of cold drinks (no coffee or hot tea) now a small bag of peanuts.

ZRH-AEP via GRU. Do not fly in code-share with TAM using Swiss and then TAM from Sao Paulo to Argentina. On departure in Europe at check in the system did not allow staff to print the boarding pass for TAM. So in both cases I arrived at Sao Paulo GRU without a boarding pass and when going to the TAM transfer desk they told me the flight was oversold and that I did not have a seat. On this trip it was even worse. We finally got on the airplane accepting that we would hold our baby on our laps instead of in the purchased seat and once in the boarded just before departure they came and said we had to get off as they had lost the ticket for our baby in their system. Their words: you need to go and talk to Swiss to get a new ticket. This after a 20hr trip with a 19 month old infant having boarded and everything. Sao Paulo GRU airport is a disaster. No clear directions and badly trained staff. They tell you where to go only to find out that the direction was wrong. When you then talk to them again they say sorry I do not speak English or Spanish. I heard this same comment from a lot of travelers about this airport. Try to avoid this airport.

SCL-GRU and CWB-SCL-CWB. Having flown from Australia it's always an exciting to travel on a foreign airline. Given that TAM do not fly to Australia this was a real treat! I enjoyed every moment of the flight on a B777 on SCL-GRU and taking away the GRU arrival issues the flight experience was great! I think I would have had a harder time 'getting used to it' had I not spoken my broken Portuguese they really appreciated it as did I! The crew were professional the service expected and the IFE viewable. Domestic BRA flights are simple and easy.

J Class from GRU to MEX on A330-200. Plenty of space and decent cabin forward of the main door however staff were relatively unfriendly throughout the flight. Meals were ok but nothing special however wine list was very good. Angled lie flat had plenty of space but was uncomfortable in sitting position and not very good as a flat bed (too angled and lumpy with poor headrest / footrest. Nothing was overly bad and very little was overly good.

### TAM Airlines customer review
September 6 2013 Business Class from Frankfurt to Santiago via Sao Paulo. Airplane 777 fairly new. FA's make you feel they were doing you a favor bringing you food. Very cold service attitude and sometimes rude. They expected everyone to speak Portuguese. Plane in this section had 3 bathroom one was kept locked only for FA's to use. They did not care there was a line and still kept the bathroom closed. Food was ok nothing special. Inflight entertainment had a poor selection of films. Chaotic boarding in SAO.

CGH-SDU GIG-IGU IGU-GRU and SCL-GRU in August 2013. Very different experience on these flights. CGH-SDU: cabin crew average food not bad old A319 but ok for such a short flight. GIG-IGU: excellent crew service food only a cold sandwich new A320 which had good seat pitch. IGU-GRU: crew service again very attentive and friendly food the same sandwich I received on previous flight old A320 not so comfortable. SCL-GRU on 77W: best aircraft with acceptable inflight entertainment system but would be insufficient if I was flying long haul. Last few rows with 2-4-2 seating compared to 3-4-3 should be more comfortable. Cabin crews were inefficient and not friendly. Food portion was extremely small. All in all TAM was not bad. My experience of TAM was better than LAN especially on check in efficiency and crew service.

### TAM Airlines customer review
MXP-GRU and back in economy class plus GRU-ASU-VVI in business class using LH miles. Overall the experience was positive despite the horrible airport in Sao Paulo a facility where there is absolutely nothing to do: just a few shops low quality bars and restaurants and a couple extremely uncomfortable waiting rooms. They are working to expand the terminal so hopefully it will get better soon. In the air everything was okay: A330-200 for the intercontinental leg and A320 for the Asuncion / Santa Cruz one. Good looking and clean planes and pleasant crew even if not super friendly in some cases. The food quality is slightly above average even though they should serve bigger portions. On the minus side I have to mention the entertainment system which should be upgraded as the selection is rather limited and it needed to be rebooted several times during the 12-hour flight from Milan to Sao Paulo. All flights were on time except the GRU-ASU which left one hour late because of a missing passenger whose luggage had to be offloaded (this apparently simple operation seemed to take ages). Will probably choose them again for my trips to South America as they have a good network and a direct flight from my hometown.

### TAM Airlines customer review
3 domestic flights and then one to Miami (on different dates). FOR-MAO flight was uncomfortable. Passengers coughed all 3 hours because of the excessive dryness in the air that I've never experienced in 20 years of flying. On my GIG-SLZ flight I was assigned an exit row seat only to encounter an unpleasant flight attendant who said I couldn't sit there if I didn't speak Portuguese. I got switched to the back of the plane. Disappointing to see the snacks served in so much plastic and packaging. Would use again when cheaper than other airlines.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Took several internal flights around Brazil. Rio-Belo Horizonte-Brasilia-Manaus-Rio. Overall I liked all of the flights seats were OK food was quite all right for the short hops we were taking. Cabin staff smiled and were pleased to help. I was surprised that there was no electronic entertainment at all luckily we took tablet PC's. Booking in was quite slow and the automated booking in system has so many questions that I didn't bother even trying with it on any of the flights.

BRU-FRA-SAO-MVD return. 1st class cabin on all intercontinental legs. Did two trips in May and June all of 6 legs inbound and outbound using LH (code share) for the BRU-FRA-BRU legs and TAM for the rest. Both A340 and B777 aircraft. Well trained staff. Excellent concierge service on ground and very good onboard. Specially for waiting for you at gate to take you through security pass control and immigration quickly. Service includes picking your bags too no limo service in MVD. Aircraft has only 4 seats in 1st class cabin and I was the only pax on all of 4 transatlantic legs. Good food and ok drinks. Amenities ok. All in all good service reminded me of good old Varig 1st class service. Will recommend.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Flew from Brisbane on 10th June 2013 and owing to LAN's failure to meet it's scheduled arrival time I was offloaded onto TAM to depart from Santiago at 07.00 hours 11th June. Arrived at the airport at 05.00 hrs to find out that take off was delayed. At 10.00 hrs a statement was issued that the plane would be loading at 12.00pm. At 1.30pm a further statement was issued that owing to the fact that the flight could no longer be completed within the flight crews designated hours the flight was cancelled and would now be going at 22.00 hrs. At 22.30 they began loading luggage and pax at 23.00. Sometime after midnight the captain informed us we had too many pax on board and some would have to be offloaded when this was completed it was 01.15 on 12th of June and regrettably as the crew could now no longer complete the journey in their allowed time frame this flight was also cancelled and we were instructed to reassemble at 05.00 for a 07.00 departure which eventually left at 07.30. I had now been at the Santiago airport for a total of 40 hrs. Had been through customs and immigration 3 times out and 3 times in. I arrived in Rio two days late missed seeing the sights or taking pre booked tours and thankfully have never come across this level of ineptitude or incompetence before.

### TAM Airlines customer review
JFK-EZE via GRU in Economy Class. Seating on the 777 on the route from JFK and back was awful. The 3-4-3 configuration of the cabin should be illegal. The seats were narrow cramped it was a miserable experience. The flight to/from EZE from GRU were on A-330-200 was much better. It had a 2-4-2 configuration seats were wider a by far more comfortable experience. Flights departed on time and the flight attendants were great! The food service was just ok. I would use TAM again but I will try leaving from MIA on a day time flight instead.

### TAM Airlines customer review
LHR-EZE via GRU out and GIG back. Best price I found for route with short connections. I thought legroom reasonable for economy. Food OK on long haul but the dry cheese and ham roll on connecting flights a let down. Entertainment good - mix of new releases and good older films. Re comments about FAs - right or wrong I have found on all South America routes you are expected to go and get any nuts drinks snacks etc from them works like a bar. They were helpful with warm milk for the kids and moving our seats on the way back (arm rests wouldn't lift up for kids to sleep). Luggage went through connections fine to other end including 2 piece pushchair left at door of aeroplane at first leg of each trip. First experience with TAM and would be happy to use again based on this experience.

### TAM Airlines customer review
FRA-GRU/GIG-FRA. Economy class. Window seated both ways. Overnight. Ground staff were ok. Attendants on board were ok. Staff very helpful until the start. Later during the flight the food was rushed because there of some turbulence during the first hour. Quality of the food was better on the way to Brazil than on the way back. Later light was dimmed. The movie selection was good. As I am 1.84m I always have problems with my seating and so on. It was not enough for me given the fact that both ways my neighbours were sleeping so there was no easy way out. Baggage arrived fine both ways.

### TAM Airlines customer review
London Heathrow-Sao Paulo return. Overnight flights both ways. Boarding efficient at both ends. Boeing 777 with 10-abreast economy cabin which felt cramped. Legroom just about bearable - I'm 1.82m and my knees were touching the magazine pocket of the seat in front (pocket seemed to jut out considerably which had noticeably detrimental effect on legroom). Meals served soon after take-off on both flights and were quite skimpy but perhaps no bad thing so late at night. Cabin crew retired to galley after meal service and were not obvious until breakfast. Variety on IFE was limited but there were some reasonably modern films that passed the time. In all a very average (and somewhat tedious) 11-hour flight.

### TAM Airlines customer review
FOR-GIG-FOR all in economy class (A320). Seating cramped but no worse than most economy class seats these days. The snack served each way on this 3.5 hour flight was perhaps the most environmentally unfriendly food service I've seen: a large plastic tray wrapped in plastic containing a very small packet of a couple of small crackers another packet (plastic wrapped) with a small cake and a small toil-wrapped cube of cheese). Much more plastic than used to be used when the airline served hot foil-wrapped ham and cheese sandwiches. A child became ill on the flight when we landed people started to disembark then were told to re-board the plane until a health official came on board. In-flight entertainment consisted of overhead monitors every few rows with volume that could be heard by almost no one. Flight back was less eventful. Just the same plastic-enclosed snack.

EZE-GRU. Business passengers have access to the AeropuertosVipClub lounge at EZE. The place was full and hot so much that I had to ask the receptionist to turn on the Air Conditioning. Snacks and drinks available but only basic stuff. No chance to feel spoiled there. Didn't hear the boarding announcement and we were the last passengers to board after the final call - though not late really. FAs were distant and did not connect to the passengers - at least to us. The lady was so busy taking care of a passenger with a physical condition that didn't bother to pay attention to us. Got the impression that we were a burden to them not welcomed at all and certainly not better than when traveling Economy. Good airplane (A330) though very old (PT- MVC). Seats (5H5K) more than adequate since that plane has a long haul configuration and our trip took no longer that 3.5hours.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Flew from LHR-GIG and GIG-GRU-LHR outbound A330 flight was on time which was good start. No drinks before dinner and we only got our drinks towards the end of our meal its quicker to find cabin crew than use the call bell as they just don't bother to answer. The crew were not busy as I could see them talking and laughing in the galley. Entertainment is great if you only want to watch films that are a few years old nothing that recent to see. Inbound GIG-GRU internal flights on not bad 50 mins flight with drinks and snacks then GRU-LHR on a 777 same as way out no drinks before dinner and crew quite slow for service. Hope not to use them again.

Business FRA-GRU-FRA on 777. Positive: Large amenity kit smooth check in. Average: The entertainment programme and the seat comfort with lie flat seats in a 2-3-2 config. Negative: Worst service I've experienced - on both flights. Staff seemed to avoid as many walks as possible through the cabin to check if passengers were in need of anything. The 4 course meal is served all together on one tray at the same time! Every little extra that other airlines' attendants offer by themselves had to be actively ordered: Coffee and digestives after meal the bottle of water for the night the hot breakfast. They provide 3 hot breakfast options in the menu but you only receive it when you specifically ask for it. Bathroom was filthy in the morning. Paper and cups were not refilled. The "VIP" lounge at GRU airport is a nightmare. There's a piano man playing for the guests. Well at least he had got a chair to sit on. 20-25 passengers on that night were not that lucky. For the biggest airline at the largest int. airport of a major country that's simply a disgrace.

GRU-SCL-GRU. Codeshare flights with LX. Arrived at GRU coming from ZRH with Swiss. I was a bit worried as only had 1 hour lay over. Boarding was well organized. 777-300 packed. Seats comfortable but a bit cramped as they do the 3-4-3 layout but for a 4 hours flight was fine. Breakfast was scarce and quite disgusting just a hot ham and cheese panini - almost inedible. On the way back they served lunch which was tasty but once again minimal portions. AVOD good with wide choice of movies in many different languages. Both flights on time and luggage made the 3 connections I had which was a plus. I would fly them again but would avoid long hauls.

Cancelled BA LHR-GRU flight due to snow on the 18/01 managed to get the next available flight to Sao Paulo via Madrid. Flew BA on LHR-MAD then TAM on MAD-GRU. I was impressed with the service and comfort. The FA were very attentive and helpful. The only drawback was that the IFE was not working but we were so tired after being in airports waiting for flights/connections etc that we slept most of the journey. Would fly TAM again.

Sao Paulo - Manaus - Sao Paulo. The most absurd was the food served on this 4 hours flight time enough for feeling hungry: a small toast two biscuits a square pasteurized cheese and water (or soda). The interesting fact was seeing other crew members probably from another flight sitting behind us and having a warm meal on a tray with salad entree and dessert. Strange also is to sit on a large seat that reclines a lot (very comfortable) but have no pillows. And be in a cold cabin (very cold on that flight) and have no blankets.

We flew BSB-GRU-JFK and back in Business and as ever the BSB-GRU leg is in economy because they don't have a Business section but they always charge full economy rate. Inflight domestic: choice of Coke or water. Staff are attentive but nothing brilliant. In GRU the lounge is a joke - more people standing than sitting and not even beers were available. Boarding was via a bus and chaotic (TAM have instituted a set of categories for boarding but more often than not it is ignored at boarding gates). GRU-JFK and back - seats are nothing great for Business class (not fully reclining) and food is at best average. Wines are good though. Flight was on time and luggage delivered quickly in JFK but not GRU.

New York to Brazil in First. TAM's service on the ground at JFK and at Sao Paulo and Rio when flying First at least is one of the best anywhere. Combines Brazilian friendliness with efficiency to great effect. The food is fine but not up to par with the best airlines as is the entertainment. The seat is very comfortable wide and of course flat although the cabin could do with a little refreshing with regard to the decor as could the tableware (yes this is not critical). One note for competing airlines: after I sped through immigration I waited barely 5 minutes for my luggage which came out on a cart with a porter who accompanied me to my car.

LHR - Rio on 7/11/12 20.45 (A330). Return from Sao Paulo on 5/12/12 to LHR at 13.30 (B777). Excellent in LHR T1 both ways especially returning. Priority boarding both ways - very useful in Brazil. On board - comfortable space excellent meals decent wines. Attentive service. Good IFE. B777 is quieter then A330. Seat not great for sleeping on way out. Solved problem on return. Got a 2nd pillow put it below feet. Slept really well. Only (small) grouses: 1. Pilots often signalled seat belts sign - and thus no cabin service or toilet access - with minor turbulence. 2. Sao Paulo TAM business lounge too small and poor choice of food. TAM is good value.

GRU-SCL yesterday 19/11/2012 Business Class. Staff speak no English Spanish or other language spoken other than Portuguese. No Star Gold priority line on boarding. Food is a joke for a 4 hour flight just one round of drinks and no welcome water/juice/champagne. Seats are old in a new 777-300. Very uncomfortable and are not lie flat like old style Biz seats. The only good part is that it was quite on time arrived 15 min later in SCL. Baggage took a long 45 minutes to arrive. Overall not worth the price I paid for a round trip in Business class.

Flew Santos Dumont (Rio) to Congonhas (Sao Paulo) on November 10th. A319 aircraft - looked very new. I was on a later flight but friendly TAM agent offered me an earlier flight as weather was rainy and sometimes they close SD airport. Got my window seat and was off. Boarding was very organized. Plane was clean and about 95% full. For a 50-minute flight you get a drink and snack box with a yummy sandwich and peanuts. Smooth flight and prompt luggage retrieval at the end. My first time with TAM and I would fly them again in a second.

MIA-GRU aboard the 77W. The TAM economy experience was standard with the rest of the industry - nothing exceptional nor abysmal and the well maintained aircraft really helped. Seat comfort was decent with leg space providing the typical 32 inch space that is usually found in the economy class cabin and the recline was a bit more better than most. The area TAM makes strides in is when it comes to their in-flight entertainment system which provides a wide variation of films TV shows music games and much more! Food wise it was just okay with the food being decent and nothing really to write home about: omelette for breakfast as the flight commenced early morning and pasta chicken or beef for dinner. Service offered by the cabin crew was pleasant but with some shortcomings as their lacked a personal touch. Moreover as a *G member I did feel that there was some negligence on TAMs part in demonstrating their Star Alliance membership with the absence of priority boarding service and star signage. Another drawback is the ridiculously long wait for baggage to come out due to the excessive baggage check-ins by passengers and the antiquated facilities at Guarulhos airport which really is not TAMs fault. Overall TAM delivered a decent product and I would consider flying them again if the price is right.

MAD-GRU-BSB. BSB-GRU-FRA-TXL (last segment on LH). Generally a good experience. Madrid to Sao Paulo on A330 clean seat comfort average. On-board service good but old LCD screens on the IFE leave a lot to be desired. Sao Paulo to Frankfurt was on a B777 in a 3-4-3 configuration which I thought would be very tight because of other customer comments here but are actually fine and I am a fairly big guy. Seat recline very comfortable for Economy class and IFE was above average. A321s on BSB-GRU segments were clean and pleasant. All flights on time. Transfers at Sao Paulo are confusing but I recommend a minimum 2-hour connection arriving in Sao Paulo if you are connecting to an onward flight because of delays at immigration baggage pickup and drop off and a confusing airport (on first visit). Several colleagues missed connecting flights in Sao Paulo arriving on AF and KLM with a 90-minute connection and had to spend the night. Language skills at the airport are poor if you don't speak Portuguese. Two TAM airline staff in Sao Paulo insisted they could not check me in and issue a boarding pass for my LH connection in Europe even though the whole trip was on a TAM ticket. I was later able to do this at the TAM automated machines in Sao Paulo.

Santiago to Sao Paulo on TAM business and I found the service standard very poor. Boarding at the gate was chaotic and business and first class passengers were kept waiting at the gate for more than 30 mins. Business class staff seemed uninterested no after take off drinks offered. The first drink we received was with our lunch which was delivered on one single tray. I found the service standard of the this flight below other companies' business class services and a little smile from the crew will go a long way. The business class seats (this was a Boeing 777 aircraft) were uncomfortable and with a need for new covers - they look worn out. I would not recommend the airline for international flights.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Watch out for C class fares. Between Brazil and Argentina TAM sells Business class fares on planes not offering this service. If you get lucky enough to connect out of Rio or S.P you will be offered on the Brazilian leg of your flight to pay an extra BRL30.00 for a bulkhead or exit row seat even if you paid C class fare for the whole portion of your trip. The Business class product is outdated with an old seat design and odd ergonomics as well as a very basic video system. Staff is doing the bare minimum.

Milan to Buenos Aires for the second time in this month. Arrived at the airport checked in and ground agents never told me the flight was delayed. I spoke with a lady who told me that she knew it before checking in. I could have called and change my ticket. Crew only spoke Portuguese no English. Very poor service. Landed in Sao Paulo and connecting to a flight that would take me to Buenos Aires. Impossible. Flight cancelled. Agents said we would be taken to a hotel because other flights were full. I asked an agent who spoke Italian a ground agent who made me fly with GOL airlines and land in a small city airport in Buenos Aires. Will ask my company to change my return. Not flying a Brazilian airline anymore.

No German speaking FA's even in Business. For a 12 hour flight FRA-GRU the food portions are far too small. FA's don't help a passenger flying with 2 toddlers. The seating is not acceptable with the 3-4-3 layout. Much too narrow. The movies I had already seen in February. The only good thing is the staff in FRA. The rest you can forget. If LH catches up with the entertainment system in the old 747 it is my choice in the future for direct flights if the price is right.

Flew CNF-GRU-LHR-GIG-CNF in business in July. For the most part an OK experience. Check in was fine and quick. Seats comfortable more shell shaped than lie flat I was able to sleep for a few hours on both legs. Service was courteous. Outbound flights on time but lounge at GRU way to small. Return flight had a one hour delay on the GIG-CNF leg. Food OK but nothing special and IFE screen big and easy to use but limited selection. Priority tag on bags meant nothing on last leg. My bag was one of the last ones to be delivered. My main gripe is that even if booked in C you end up flying Y in domestic sectors.

MAD-GRU First Class July 16th 2012. Extremely friendly check in staff at Madrid Barajas was a good start. Lounge is a shared one for multiple airlines and a bit downbeat. First Class passengers can board early and if so are provided with quality drinks and tasty snacks. Plane was fully boarded 30 minutes before departure despite being 100% full and departed 20 mins early. Delicious light healthy meal and slept for over 6 hours. Early departure ensured we were the first plane to land early morning at 04.30 in GRU allowing me to beat the dreaded immigration queues and be downtown by 05.45. Return flight next day was equally good and First lounge a haven from the horrors of GRU. Plan was at remote stand and was driven to the plane as the lone F passenger. Excellent Brazilian dishes on board in addition to a really good top quality wine selection. AVOD was ok . Slept comfortably for 7 hours. Overall great crew and ground staff that make a real difference. Will fly TAM again whenever I get the chance.

I flew GRU-FRA after having flown FRA-GRU with Lufthansa on an old 747 with only one overhead screen. Perhaps my flight down to Brazil with LH was so bad but I was pleasantly surprised by the service TAM offered in Economy on their 777. Wonderful entertainment system with AVOD. Choice of menu's and free alcoholic drinks. Granted their knowledge of English was limited but that should only be a problem for monoculture passengers. A few words of Portuguese did miracles.

### TAM Airlines customer review
POA-GRU-LHR Tam are getting worse. Nowadays they don't even offer simple sandwiches on short flights just biscuits and sometimes a bit of cheese! Breakfast on the international flight is always horrible. The choice is between eggs and a bread roll and butter or a sandwich and bread roll with butter. What does one do with so much bread and butter without jam or cheese for breakfast? If you are vegetarian dinner is less than delightful! Be prepared for pasta which that is always glued together and dry. The meat dishes are marginally better. I fly quite regularly between POA and LHR via GIG or GRU. Food has become the major issue apart from the poor leg room in Economy. Staff are generally quite helpful and are trained to tell you to 'Talk to the President' about all problems and those people can be down right rude! Recently they have started charging between 180-220k miles each way for an upgrade and keep offering tickets for 40-50k miles upgrades which don't exist. In my opinion anyone who wants a bit more comfort should not bother with them. I prefer putting up with rude flight attendants from BA and purchasing a Premium Economy ticket rather than this mess with Tam. And finally when you travel LHR-GRU-POA be prepared that your luggage does not arrive at the same time that you do in POA! Out of 20 flights in the past 36 months my luggage was 'lost' 5 times and arrived on average between 48 and 96 hours later. No compensation offered.

I have recently travelled to Brazil from the UK. I took a total of 6 flights including 2 international and 4 domestic flights all with TAM. I found the staff to be unhelpful the airline food was terrible (relative to other airlines) the planes were dirty and the entertainment choice was very limited. I have flown with many airlines and found this company provided the worst conditions I have experienced.

### TAM Airlines customer review
MIA-GIG on June 16. Plane was an extremely old and shabby 767-300. Business seats completely outdated 1970-style. No "cocoons" at all. Crew was attentive but food was just acceptable without any special charm. No in-flight entertainment at all. Quite a disappointing experience in contrast with the GIG-JFK leg on June 3 (on a comfortable A-330).

Non-stop Airbus A330 from New York to Sao Paulo. I had an aisle seat and I found the flight attendants to be very polite and patient. The movies on the flight were good the headphones were horrible and I was glad to have brought mine. The leg room was good as I was in an Aisle seat but the folks in the middle seats looked crammed in. The food was okay it was like a traditionally Brazilian "fast food" type of dish. The flight attendants are great about refilling drinks and do not complain about it. The bathrooms were generally clean and towards the end of the flight of course became dirty but did not run out of toilet paper or soap.

JFK-GRU-EZE EZE-GRU-JFK. I was pleasantly surprised. The first leg of my trip from New York to Sao Paulo was on a nicely kept A330 for the 9.5 hour flight. Flight attendants were friendly and spoke decent English/Spanish in addition to their native Portuguese. Seats were comfortable and had lots of leg room and the AVOD was great. The meals weren't anything special but they were ok. The flight from Sao Paulo to Buenos Aires was on an old but well kept A320. Nothing special about this flight good or bad. My return from EZE to GRU was on a A321 which had minimal leg room. Again the attendants were friendly and the drinks and food weren't bad. The second long haul leg from GRU to JFK was just as good as the trip down. TAM is miles ahead of any US carrier that flies to South America. The only downside to TAM is having to connect in GRU which is one of the worst airports I've ever been in. Overall highly recommended.

Frankfurt - Sao Paulo. Arrived at the airport 2 hours early there were only 3 people in the business class queue check-in was very fast. Onboard Boeing 777 offered champagne and orange juice then brought 2 bowls with 2 different kinds of cheese. I had 2 meals during the flight dinner and breakfast the food was good nothing special. A good experience flight attendants were polite and elegant the aircraft was immaculate.

### TAM Airlines customer review
First Class GRU-EZE A330: I transferred at GRU and was escorted from the fluorescent lit and well worn lounge at GRU to the aircraft I was expecting something special for the almost 3 hour international flight. Initial introductions and menu distribution coincided with juice or water in real glass but no amenity kit. Although my breakfast order from the 2 main courses was taken as well as my request for an after takeoff drink this turned out to be a joke. The meal was inedible came directly from business both courses were then presented despite my order and no after takeoff drink ever arrived. There was no other service and call bells went unanswered. The cabin is well by its sell by date grubby and although the seat is lie flat it otherwise has basic function and more comfortable when not in full recline. AVOD was ok but the screen and tint/brightness made it uncomfortable to watch. To put things in context US domestic carrier first is appalling but superior.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Flew A330 from Sao Paulo to Rio. Plane was onward to France. Plane was delayed 3 hours. There were no seats available while waiting for the flight it was extremely hot so the terminal experience was not good. Getting on this plane was wonderful after the cramped conditions onboard two Emirates flights. 2x4x2 seating configuration gave comfortable seating and much appreciated leg room. The plane was clean staff were friendly and attentive. At last we could all get some sleep.

### TAM Airlines customer review
EWR-GRU-POA roundtrip. Provider was Continental for the 4 legs of the trip. Trip was mostly good. Tam providing the usual problems. For the second time they lost the full ticket configuration and forced me to pay for excess baggage and carry bags in GRU. Amazing that they cannot do such a simple thing like hold on to their records!

### TAM Airlines customer review
JFK-GIG-EZE EZE-GRU-JFK. The seats are the best part quite comfortable and can be used as fully extended beds. Food was ok but not memorable. Staff service was not good poor English little motivation and less dedication to work. Lots of room for improvement.

London-Sao Paulo-Madrid. London-Sao Paulo: Brand new 777 very clean. Seat configuration 3-4-3 in main cabin is uncomfortable. Flight attendants were very polite and helpful. Food was OK nothing special. Sao Paulo-Madrid: Sao Paulo airport is very crowded I queued 40 minutes to check-in. Airbus A330 not so new clean. Flight attendants were OK most don't speak Spanish. Entertainment system only had two movies in Spanish.

CGH-SJP. Sad to see how standards have deteriorated lately. Check-in was convenient boarding on time. Seats on the A319 were so thin and hard that I was happy the flight was short. Crew were correct nothing special. Take off 20 minutes late but not TAM's fault. Typical full cost low service airline.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Very poor leg room seats not reclining correctly or broken. Bad or no food. Delays. Staff in general are friendly. The low level of service is a standard here in Brazil. Depending on flight there is some entertainment system however no headsets are provided.

### TAM Airlines customer review
LHR-GIG on A330. Outbound departure on time. Pre-departure drink although just water was provided. Amenities kit given. FA were professional and polite and attentive to call bells. Legroom and seat width were at par to other European carriers' long haul aircraft's. Entertainment system was ok better than nothing. Food presentation looked cheap and the quality was somewhat only for filling up your stomach. Inbound pretty much the same experience food slightly more edible. Baggage on the carousel in good time both ways.

### TAM Airlines customer review
EZE-GRU on A320. Star Alliance Gold flying business class. It took 30 mins to complete check-in process. No priority queue for security and immigration. No priority boarding for Star Gold and business class passengers. Flight departed 20 mins late without explanation. Combined drink and meal service began 1 hour after take off and service was very slow. The meal was okay and quantity sufficient. Pillow and blanket provided. Cabin was somewhat worn but otherwise clean and everything working. No IFE though. FA did not come around again for the remainder of the flight. FA spoke very limited English. On arrival checked baggage delivery was very slow and my priority tagged bags did not come off first. Overall a below average flight.

### TAM Airlines customer review
London Heathrow to Santiago Chile. Very little leg room seats rock hard. Cabin crew were down right apathetic if not rude I speak good Spanish and would have thought at least Spanish speaking cabin crew they only spoke Brazilian. The safety video was in Brazilian and aimed at kids it was in other languages but the sound was so bad. Mobiles were not switched off on take off and landing cabin crew did not check everyone was strapped in. The worst airline I have come across.

### TAM Airlines customer review
JFK-GRU on B777 business class. In GRU the VIP lounge is well used and only has 3 bathrooms which is insufficient causing queues at times. There is only one shower room which is not enough in comparison to the number of passengers. On boarding we were met by a rude impolite crew. The seat is comfortable but not full flat. The entertainment system is fair and works well. Overall a poor experience.

### TAM Airlines customer review
JFK-GIG-GRU-JFK. I checked in through business class check-in entitled to star alliance gold member however it still took me more than 15 min just waiting for check-in. Boarding was messy with no particular order. Seat was tiny and recline as bad as US airlines. Attendants hardly understand English and the seat monitor was tiny with very limited channels. Return trip even worse even though it was same old A330. Other than good value I would not fly with them.

### TAM Airlines customer review
GRU-NAT roundtrip with connection at GIG in return leg. Planes were A320 poor legroom already default for this airline. No onboard entertainment on both GRU-NAT (almost a 4-hour flight) and NAT-GIG (3 hour-flight) routes. No announcements in English except in GIG-GRU leg. Free drinks and snacks despite the low-cost service level.

### TAM Airlines customer review
JFK–GIG–MAO–MIA in J class. Seats are outdated ground service poor and the domestic leg was awful. JFK to GIG on an A330 with a seat they call lie flat but actually is a sort of recliner where the backrest slides down but remains curved. Staff friendly food ok wine choices inspired and champagne a nice touch. Returning check-in at Manaus took over half an hour (only two agents on duty for a full 767) and another half an hour for security where there was no fast track. There was no lounge but after an hour standing in line it was close to boarding anyway. The 767 from Manaus has old-style recliners and ancient main screen IFE which is irritating if trying to read. There is no menu lunch arrived two hours after a 2pm departure and was awful. The four hour flight from Rio to Manaus is on a run down A320 cattle class throughout with poor seat pitch.

### TAM Airlines customer review
São Paulo GRU to Porto Alegre domestic flight. Delayed 1.5 hrs due unpredicted maintenance. The plane was replaced by a smaller model that did not have many reserved seats mine included. Was seated in vacant seat without a problem. Staff were nice and helpful. Snack of mixed nuts with premium quality beer soda or juice. Little for a lunchtime flight. I was pleased but not amazed - still much better than most Brazilian carriers. Flight arrived with one hour delay.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Flew from Rio back to London Dec 2011. Aircraft was the A330 which was spotless and staff could not be faulted they were in attendance for the whole duration. Drinks rounds were common place sweets hot towels offered. Only down side is the cattle barn they call a terminal in Rio!

### TAM Airlines customer review
I am from Brazil and live in the UK so use TAM almost every year. Although the service is reasonable there is always something to be desired. I book my flights well in advance leaving enough time for connections usually closer to the time they simply change the times making the connections rather challenging. In the last episode TAM changed the flight times in such a way that it left me with under 2 hours to connect. Anyone who has been to Brazil before will know that this is impractical as you need to go through immigration at the first international airport you land before proceeding to the domestic connection. We were stuck in long queues at immigration and long queues at the check-in desk to board the connection flight. TAM did absolutely nothing to prioritise us knowing we would be late. In fact TAM simply told us to remain in the queue and believe me everyone from that flight which needed to catch the onward flight "conveniently" missed the flight. We were then accommodated to the next flight which had a stop-over on the way and we left inside the aircraft parked by the gates for over two hours! In summary what was meant to be a very smooth flight turned out to be a nightmare with a total delay of 2.5 hours. Not great when you have toddlers with you!

### TAM Airlines customer review
I flew on an Airbus A321 from Brasilia to Fortaleza the aircraft is pretty good the space is fair but small. We all had power outlets on our seats and could use our mobiles in cruise flight. The food they gave us was a gilled cheese. The entertainment was good not great because we had shared TV's. The "reclining" seats were comfortable and the crew was kind.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Rio-London service. Was told it was direct when I booked. When I called on the day I was told there was a technical stop in SP. Turns out this Technical stop occurs every flight! So an unexpected 2.5 hr lay over in SP. Went to check-in at the business class desk in Rio my two window seats on both legs had been re-assigned. Poor English spoken at the desk and a shrug of the shoulders. Small pokey business lounge in the basement of the terminal. Then onto a bus and an all economy flight to SP. Again deplaned to bus small lounge so full people were standing up in the corridors. Onto a 777 and business class. Configured 2-3-2 so not much space. Plane looked like it had been flying for 25 years. Food was premium economy at best unimaginative and poorly presented. Ok entertainment good headphones and average staff. Uncomfortable bed which was not flat. Not a business class experience. It felt like a throw back to the 80s but at 2010 prices.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Buenos Aires-Rio de Janeiro. Business class with my wife and 2 sons. Airport staff were very helpful. The cabin was clean but my TV screen didn't work. The seat was comfortable but my wife's didn't work. The service aboard was poor and so was the food. Before departing the hostess offered only warm water. The inflight entertainment was non existent. Nevertheless the service for South American standards was acceptable.

### TAM Airlines customer review
EZE-RIO and several domestic flights in Brazil mostly on A320. Generally well presented and helpful staff food good. Only saw wine on one flight in Business where surprisingly red wine was offered with breakfast. Amex Lounge at EZE is worse than the airport itself but lounge in RIO looked good. Overall pleasant airline and would fly them again.

### TAM Airlines customer review
JFK-GIG nonstop return in economy. Both flights on time on A330 aircraft. Friendly and professional crew. Efficient check-in and good inflight service with 3 choices of meals on southbound flight and 2 choices on northbound. IFE selection was a bit weak compared to some other carriers. Will definitely consider flying them again on South American journeys.

### TAM Airlines customer review
SSA-GRU-SSA in Economy. Outbound flight rescheduled but I was contacted by telephone the previous day. Airbus A320 outbound A321 inbound both planes clean but interior worn. Tasteless roll and soft drinks served – no coffee. Flights on time staff friendly and professional.

### TAM Airlines customer review
I fly domestic and long haul with TAM and many other airlines at least twice a month with 3 or 4 flights each journey. Every flight I have had with TAM has been good. Nearly all cabin crew speak English and Spanish and the pilots announcements are always made in English and Portuguese. I don't know what other people expect. Some of the worst flights I have had have been with major carriers. TAM have courteous staff flexibility and level of service.

### TAM Airlines customer review
GRU-JFK-GRU in First Class. Excellent First Class check-in area. Poor lounge the food was cold and there was no easy Internet service. Very friendly and committed staff on the ground and inflight. There's a special staff team to support First Class passengers from check-in to boarding. Comfortable seats which turns into a real bed. Great food but not so great wine list. Entertainment system is modern with a 23" monitor but the film list is poor. In NY ground staff take care of the immigration line the best part.

### TAM Airlines customer review
FOR-GIG roundtrip. It's service and comfort are average - pretty much identical to that of the main competitor. Agents in Rio were helpful in clearing up some complications when connecting from an international flight on US Airways. On the return flight ended up on a plane that was used for short haul international flights with a First Class section though for this (domestic) flight it seemed to be one-class. We got first row seats but other passengers came up to that section once the flight commenced. Food consisted of a small basic foil-wrapped sandwich and a variety of drinks (including beer). I did leave a hat in the upper baggage bin (my fault). Tried to contact airline's lost and found department but gave up after agent kept asking if I wanted to cancel the ticket for the flight that had already taken place. Phone service can be very uneven.

### TAM Airlines customer review
I've been living in Brazil for 5 years and frequently fly TAM almost weekly. Their frequent-flyer program customer service is really poor and their flights are usually delayed. The Economy seats are very narrow and the meals are low quality. The staff are nice and educated and the aeroplanes clean.

GRU-GIG return. On the first flight the aircraft was new return flight aircraft looked old but both had comfortable seating and plenty legroom.

Overall a good airline to fly with no delays or complaints.

### TAM Airlines customer review
LHR-GIG return. Airplane cabin staff and service all good. AVOD ok but not great. Poor quality screen outbound. I also have a problem with touchscreen only systems as I always seem to sit in front of someone who jabs at it. My problem was on the return leg departing Rio at 00.35 and arriving into London late afternoon. By the time food or drink came to the back of Economy it was well into the flight and most were asleep. Breakfast was then served around 15.30 BST. A long gap between meals and everyone was awake well before this.

GRU-FOR. Purchased 2 comfort seat. With a son standing 6'5" and considering the tight seat pitch I thought this was a good deal. Arrived at the airport early and boarded a full flight to find one of the seats was not a "comfort seat". I complained to the cabin crew they asked the flight dispatcher to come onboard who explained the flight was full and it had been a mistake to sell me that seat as a comfort seat and I would be reimbursed on arrival. Upon arrival I was sent from one counter to another and after a lot of problems was told I had to contact the airline in writing.

I flew TAM from Sao Paulo-Bogota in Executive Class. It took 2 hrs after take off to receive something to drink/eat and there are only 12 seats in Executive class in an Airbus 320 for a 6 hr flight. Only drinks available was wine beer or Whisky nothing else. You had to choose the food  desert drink all at the same time. I fly Business Class a lot and I could not really understand this.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Flew TAM from SCL-LHR and back to BUE via GRU planes were all very modern cabin crew as good as you can hope for in Economy Class and the overall experience was a lot better than the same flight on BA or Aerolineas. Only complaint would be that the seats in Economy are very very narrow compared to other airlines and the food on the flight from GRU-LHR was absolutely terrible.

### TAM Airlines customer review
AEP-GIG-SSA-MCZ on TAM. Great experience overall. First leg from Buenos Aires-Rio was excellent full meal service with hot towels pillows provided and a complementary caramel distributed at the start. Other sectors also good hot snack provided on GIG-SSA and nuts on SSA-MCZ as well as drinks. Overall despite being expensive very much enjoyable.

Sao Paulo Congonhas to Goiania and return then Sao Paulo Guarulos to Buenos Aires. Very good experience. Flights on time apart from a 1 hour delay on return from Goiania. Crew very personable as were the ground staff (how refreshing to have a laugh with someone at check in who obviously enjoyed her job). Airbus aircraft comfortable good VOD on the longer flight. Snacks/meals were appropriate to the journey. Must say I was very positively surprised. I would definitely use them again.

### TAM Airlines customer review
JFK-GRU-SCL SCL-ASU-GRU-JFK. Flights on time boarding was pretty much orderly. Planes clean legroom and seat comfort decent. Cabin crew on shorter sectors seemed friendlier and obliging. You get 3 choices for a main meal in Economy. IFE was very limited and on the old A330 from JFK it didn't work at all. Only 4 toilets for a packed Economy cabin on the A330 meant lines throughout the flight. B777 was better. Crew on long international sector well groomed but not friendly or engaging. Meals are really tiny - catering portions pretty much the same regardless of the length of flight. No refills on coffee or drinks. Meal quality was fair to disappointing. Considering the options going to South America from the US - they are still miles ahead of any American carrier. That's not saying much.

### TAM Airlines customer review
FRA-GRU-EZE EZE-GIG-FRA. Frankfurt to Sao Paulo in B777 was not very impressive mainly due to the unfriendly and inattentive staff. Most flight attendants barely speak English food was alright even though they do not hand out menus. Sao Paulo-Buenos Aires (A330) was a good service - staff was nice (nicer than their sandwiches). Buenos Aires-Rio (A330) cabin staff not good in English but tried their best. Rio-Frankfurt A330 nothing to complain about. Flight entertainment could be better. They hand out little bathroom kits (brush etc).

### TAM Airlines customer review
One of the worst customer service experiences I have had. Tickets for flight GRU-NAT bought in October 2010 for December decided to refund them in November 2010. Since then an accumulated correspondence of 35 Emails no one really feels responsible they keep asking for my account data ticket details etc. but so far I have not seen one cent. European customer service staff at least respond but seem to be completely unable to get any information from staff in Brazil. Also as was mentioned by another poster before some short reviews with very high evaluations appearing on this site are most likely written by TAM themselves as they are known to do so in Brazil. Avoid this airline at all cost.

Overnight flight from Heathrow to Sao Paulo. As I was on crutches when booking in we asked for extra leg room seats which we were given. Flight was brilliant with constant attention by cabin crew bring drinks and choice of food which was very good.

### TAM Airlines customer review
LHR-GRU-SCL and back economy. Price cheaper than competition by nearly 10%. Reserved seats online months in advance - reservations honoured. Check in staff and flight attendants were competent and reasonably friendly and polite. Seat narrow but adequate. All flights on time or early IFE showed up to date films and worked. Bags on arrival. On a cost/ benefit basis I would recommend them although I was unimpressed with the facilities in GRU.

FRA-EZE-FRA with connections in GRU and GIG. Check-in FRA very fast and friendly. FRA-GRU was only lightly booked so I got quite a bit of sleep. IFE very good food average service was okay but nothing special. GRU-EZE nothing to report. EZE check-in was fast and efficient. A light snack was served more filling than tasty. Transfer in GIG quite chaotic the airport was very bare and deserted at 10 pm. GIG-FRA fully booked food below average and service almost robotic. During the flight sleeping was impossible due to very limited space. Crew did not make water/juice rounds. 2 pieces of baggage allowed - rare nowadays.

IGU-GRU flight check in very rude as it was the start of a long international flight with change to international from GRU - check in lady insist to decline my luggage as hand luggage. The first ever time when this was declined as hand luggage. Snack was not tasty very dry flight delayed had to run to catch connection. TAM was not a pleasant flight.

### TAM Airlines customer review
SSA-GRU on A321. I define TAM a minimal company - minimal legroom minimal onboard catering (they serve beer on internal routes) and minimal customer care by ground staff. Flight scheduled to depart from SSA at 5:17PM but took off more than 1:30 hours later due to logistics problems with crew which in the end had to be replaced. One of the many nightmares with TAM lately. The only positive point was the fast and efficient check-in.

### TAM Airlines customer review
GRU-MXP-GRU A340. This flight was overbooked so after boarding we had to hear a lady who was screaming she had lost this flight the previous night and was assigned an already-taken seat (they gave her a business class seat in the end). When we tried to buy their confort seats all have been taken and all of them by TAM staff. Crew were not friendly rude sometimes. Bad food in plastic material. Seat-pitch not good at all

### TAM Airlines customer review
GRU-FOR in economy class. Normally that's the only class available on this flight. In this case the A320 had both biz and economy. Although I had been travelling Continental Biz-First I was as expected assigned an economy class seat (had never seen a two-class plane on this leg). Once we took off I was asked if I was alone and could move and was put in a biz class seat. Could have been due to my Continental booking or because of my Star Alliance status but I understood it to be since the father of the mother and child next to me wanted to be with them. Food consisted of the usual small ham and cheese sandwich (no options). The two attendants spent much of their time at the very front of the plane by the cabin door with the curtain drawn. One dozed. As we landed no one checked to see if people had their seat belts fastened seats in the upright position etc. Not the best attention to safety but seemed par for the course.

### TAM Airlines customer review
CDG-GIG-SSA in economy. Transatlantic leg oldish Airbus 330 with a tatty interior IFE system gave trouble throughout the flight. Reasonable but bland dinner and breakfast served. Domestic leg in A320; mini-breakfast and decent coffee served. Staff courteous.

GRU-CWB the final leg in a long trip from Australia. Check in at GRU after customs was easy (no queues) no issues through security and once on board service on such a quick flight was exceptionally good. Hot snack and a beer.

### TAM Airlines customer review
We flew with TAM to and from Sao Paulo and found them at best mediocre. The food was alright and there was some IFE but way poorer than major airlines and frequently had to be re-booted by staff who frankly couldn't be bothered. The crew were poor at answering call bells and didn't seem to like their jobs. Check-in queues were very long and slow and the seats were very uncomfortable. We had exit seats on the way back but had to pay extra for the privilege and of course despite the extra leg room you still feel cramped because they are so narrow. If I was to recommend them it would only be for the price.

### TAM Airlines customer review
CWB-GRU-FRA return in First. Lie-flat bed on B777-300 ER. Check-in flawless with special service accompanying you through security lounge and gate. Lounge in GRU okay for First Class in FRA is LH Senator Lounge - crowded and inadequate for F class. Service onboard attentive food and drinks adequate (nothing special). Seat comfortable until it is laid into a bed - then the junction between seat segments creates discomfort in hip-zone. FA prepared bed with duvet and pyjamas. Deplane in GRU not okay for you are among the last in Business class to deplane and Immigration in GRU is not smooth. Flight arrived in GRU at 0400 and no transfer check-in until 0600.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Heathrow to Rio then to Sao Paulo Iguacu Curitiba Salvador Rio and return to Heathrow. Several flights arrived early delay from Curitiba appeared due to air traffic control as boarding on time. 2 hours late on return to Heathrow disappointing - little/no info at Rio and evening catering facilities airside in Rio inadequate and horribly expensive. Overall experience good check-in friendly crew. Reasonable legroom /comfort IFE catering on A330 apart from poor breakfast on Rio-Heathrow. Assigned seats for all flights prior to leaving UK which worked. A320s for internal flights less legroom but fine for these shorter journeys. The short haul ham/cheese roll is best described as adequate though we were not expecting a great culinary experience. For us on these flights TAM represented good value and an experience I would recommend. When flying out of Sao Paulo and (but less so) Rio I recommend careful watch on last minute Gate changes. Having been warned of this at Sao Paulo 5 gate changes in about 30 mins didn't surprise us and I suspect due to SP ground control rather than the airlines.

### TAM Airlines customer review
LHR-SCL via GRU in economy. LHR check at Terminal 1 the most efficient I have seen in many years of travel. Onboard the seats are not as comfortable as they should be and the entertainment system has quite a limited selection. Crew efficient and friendly. A rather depressed vegetarian dish (nothing else left) served on a poor plastic tray that slips around your fold down table was served shortly after take off - poor looking panini breakfast served before arrival. Overall the crew made this flight worthwhile and at around GBP 1000 cheaper than alternatives for this single ticket I would be tempted to use them again.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Several flights within Brazil during January-February 2011. Domestic fleet seems to consist of narrow body airbuses which are at least a decade old. Ground staff very professional and helpful; cabin crew slightly less so. Free non-alcoholic drink and snack served - the snack usually consisted of an almost inedible ham roll. Attitude to onboard safety sometimes seemed a little more casual than some airlines.

### TAM Airlines customer review
LHR-GRU-EZE return economy class experience was mediocre. Inflight entertainment is okay cabin staff polite but nothing special and seat space was a bit tight. Some of the flights were delayed up to 1hr. Overall a mediocre experience but the ticket was cheaper than competitors - hence the choice.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Last February I tried to fly from Salvador to Lima. The flight from Salvador left on time; had a stopover in Vitoria - plane was defective and did not start for 3 hours! I missed the connection in Sao Paulo. Had to wait 5 hours for the luggage. Nobody at TAM gave any passengers any help - not to talk about a hotel voucher. I gave up and flew back to Salvador. This year in January we tried to fly to Cartagena Colombia. Same story; the flight left so late that we got stranded (again) in Vitoria. Took 6 hours to get a voucher for an absolutely lousy hotel. On the flight back from Cartagena the connection was a bit tight but so far OK. When we arrived at the TAM check in counter one hour before the start; TAM personnel was cleaning up and leaving. Refused to check us in said we were 1 minute late. Refused also to book us for the next day. They asked us to come the next day 4 hours before the start what we did. They had us wait 3 hours at the counter until they finally gave us 2 coach seats (we had paid business) - then they told us to rush to the gate. When we arrived there; the plane was 1 hour delayed and there were at least 30 empty seats in the plane! In the internet they present their business class with fantastic seats etc. In reality the business class seats that they offer on the 6 hr trip to Bogota are lousy narrow and do even not have a feet rest.

FOR-GRU. Efficient flight adequate if limited seating space and the now-common tiny ham and cheese sandwich (at least it and drinks were free). Crew was efficient enough until we landed but then things sort of fell apart. When the plane briefly stopped taxiing still far from the gate many people stood up to get their bags to get in line and be among the first to disembark. When the plane continued moving with many people still standing in the aisle crew did nothing. Did not even make an announcement over the public address system. When we disembarked to busses to go to our gate airline personnel disappeared for a while. People continued to push onto the first bus in line. All in all an appalling inattentiveness to safety.

Staff in GRU airport very arrogant and rude. I had to wait 30 minutes on check in. I had bought the tickets with assigned seats in the internet but somehow I was given other seats. As a Star Gold I went to the business class lounge with is located in the terminal 1 - the check in is in the terminal 2 of course nobody tells you that. Lounge crowded and very simple. Inflight meal is a joke just a sandwich. IFE with just a few movies and old ones at that. How come Star Alliance let them in?

Extremely disorganized in check-in and boarding. I made a web-check-in with a connection and printed my boarding pass at home. The first flight worked perfectly well the second I boarded normally and on the plane my seat had been booked to another passenger. The staff took more than 20 minutes to sort out another seat which included referring me to a seat already taken with the passenger in the bathroom. And some of the staff on board did not even know that the airline had web-check-in with home-printed boarding passes doubting the validity of my boarding pass. Seats are very cramped. Ground staff do not have a pro-active and helpful attitude. If you have a problem they tell you to sort it out yourself and if they have a problem they'll try and put the blame on you. Bad experiences. If you have a choice avoid.

Sao Paolo-Fortaleza-Porto Alegre and refused to fly them on two more sectors. Chose GOL instead. Staff on the ground are indifferent and hardly speak English. One bag did not arrive and I had to wait for two hours before I got assistance. Inflight service is a disgrace. We decided to fly Gol an airline that reflected the true spirit of Brazilian hospitality. Good seats friendly crew fluent in languages. Tam never again not even for free.

Sao Paulo International airport it was hard to find english speaking staff. Sao Paulo - Manaus more than 3 hrs flight told we get a hot meal - it was a tasteless sandwich. The entire business class was crowded with staff they were still having drinks during and after landing. Very arrogant attitude. Manaus- Belem: flight was canceled. We had to queue for almost 90 minutes. No english speaking staff and three different versions were given why the flight was canceled. Belem- Fortaleza birds in the engine during stopover in Sao Luis : No english explanation. Despite having Germans Italians and French passengers. It took us almost 4 hours to leave the airport. Hotel was a disgrace. Had to wait for two hours before meals were served. Some meals were not available. Fortaleza - Salvador I asked the steward why the pilot doesn't make announcements in English : I am sorry sir the captain is Japanese maybe he doesn't speak English. How did TAM enter Star Alliance?

Sao Paulo GRU to London LHR Economy B777-300. There were a few films I would like to have watched but the audio in my seat 45G wasn't working. The crew said it was a fault with the aircraft and nothing could be done. Two hours into the flight the water systems in the toilets failed so the crew provided bottled water - but one toilet was completely out of action which caused huge queues down the aisles. The crew on this flight were cheerful but I will not fly TAM international by choice again.

GRU-NAT REC-GIG and GRU-CDG. Onboard experience so-so on domestic flights meal OK crew serving two rounds of drinks at 3hrs flight time completely unsmiling rude to passengers - they hate their jobs and make you feel it. On the longhaul fake smiles but rushed service then crew disappear to the galleys. Extremely disorderly cabin passengers disputing over reclined seats (as others have posted they do recline right up to your nose) throwing trash everywhere safety rules (such as open shades for landing) ignored - crew absent or indifferent. Flights not more than one hour delayed. Ground handling OK when you have Star gold as practically no lines but staff indifferent and unsmiling (one exception at domestic baggage drop GRU to be fair) do not bother to ask if assigned seats are ok forgot priority tag to on GRU-CDG leg - they want you out of the way quickly and make you feel it. Worst part is customer service : I tried to credit mileage for the long haul on TAM FF did not work online form it states I need to fax a copy of the boarding pass to Brazil as check in was done "with another airline" (checked in at GRU for a TAM flight on TAM metal). Also and worse I have been trying to get refunds for the tickets of one member of our party that chose not to travel since November no answer and when you call there is always some one else responsible - they do not care about you and make you feel it. All in all a horrible mess of an airline possibly acceptable for domestic flights without connections if fares are cheap. For longhaul never again.

ASU-EZE in A320. The seats were narrow poor legroom. Entertainment was Ok magazines and Headphones with good music. The cabin crew service was good always with a smile. Food service was good for a 2 hour flight with a snack and drinks.

GRU-LHR-GRU B777-300ER. I wouldn't recommend flying international with TAM. Me and my wife we had an awful experience during the 13 hours flying to LHR. The seats were narrow and thin. The seat ahead of us were almost in our noses when reclined. We couldn't sleep nor rest for the entire trip. The food were not so bad cabin crew were OK.

### TAM Airlines customer review
LHR-GRU-LHR and what an experience. Only advice to others who already have a ticket or no option but to fly with TAM is take a large packed lunch including drinks with you take as much personal entertainment stuff as you can do not expect to make any connecting flights learn Portuguese before you go if you have rugby scrum experience this may prove useful. I was delayed by 17 hours so maybe I'm a bit jaded. Would I fly with them again? Never in a million years.

FRA-GRU-FLN. I had chosen seats via the TAM call centre in advance and they showed on my booking online but for some reason on check-in the system had allocated totally different seats which irritated me. Boarding in Frankfurt for GRU was chaotic with different groups being called at the same time. Seats onboard have a footrest which folds up meaning if raised it sticks into my shins but when dropped it is too high for me to put my feet on. Departed on time and soon dinner was served. No menu choice - a small salad a roll and a small pasta box. Not really enough for 12 hours. One drink was served then rubbish cleared away lights dimmed for the night and the crew vanished. It was only about 10.30 European time. The only drinks available were glasses of bottled water so if you fancied a nightcap or something else it was hard luck. AVOD is average but there was enough to keep me entertained. Breakfast was a reconstituted ham and gouda panini with some fruit and a tiny polystyrene cup of coffee. Horrible. Swift transfers at GRU with an uneventful flight to Florianopolis on a modern and clean 320. In future I will not fly TAM to Brasil I will opt for one of the European carriers as TAM is now too basic when I can pay a similar amount and have a much better journey with another airline.

LHR-GRU-EZE-LHR. Polite and efficient ground handling. New B777 with AVOD. Hard working helpful crew who seem to enjoy the job. Food standard airline and small quantity. On time flights and easy transfers at GRU.

### TAM Airlines customer review
Six passengers from New York to Brazil to Buenos Aires. Terrible experience. Return flight cancelled less than one week before we left the United States with no notice from the airline. The only reason we knew about the cancellation was because we were checking the reservation on-line. Cancellation caused our trip to be cut short by one full day. On the outbound flight there was a 3 hour delay - not weather related - that caused us to miss our connection. Had to spend the night at the airport. Lost another day of our trip. Customer service could not be worse. Desperation is the only reason one should fly this airline. Never again.

### TAM Airlines customer review
FOR-GIG return. Seating and food about par for a domestic flight in the US though we did get small snacks and a tiny non-descript sandwich. Customer service reps at GIG did work hard to correct a dropped reservation caused by the other airline (US Airways). I'd rate TAM about equal to Gol. All about equally overpriced.
