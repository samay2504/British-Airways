### "highly recommend EgyptAir"
Very friendly staff, excellent service, delicious catering however cabin is a bit outdated. Other than that I highly recommend EgyptAir. Keep up the good work.

### “the seats were old and torn”
Avoid this airline at any cost! Just pay extra and fly literally ANY other airline but not Egyptair. Our flight from Dar es Salaam to Cairo has to be the MOST annoying flight ever. The check in process was a nightmare. The aircraft was old like it seemed like it was from the 90's. No in flight entertainment system (it was a 6 Hour flight), the seats were old and torn, the tray was broken, the food was pathetic with the eggs smelling really bad and the aircraft was not cleaned (there were wrappers and used tissues in the seat pocket. The staff was friendly and nice. Do not fly this airline!

### “they made no effort to help”
Not Verified | Avoid EgyptAir – A Disappointing Experience. I had a terrible experience with EgyptAir, and I’m sharing this so others are informed and, hopefully, the airline improves its service. My journey was from Mumbai to Dublin with a layover in Cairo. Here’s how it went: First Flight (Mumbai to Cairo – 6 h30 mins) Pros: The food was good. Cons: No cushions, no blankets, and no earphones for the in-flight entertainment. It was a long, uncomfortable, and boring flight. The cleanliness was also subpar. Layover: 2 hrs 30 mins Second Flight (Cairo to Dublin – 6 hrs 0 mins) Pros: The flight was cleaner than the first. Cons: No blankets, no cushions, and no in-flight service for the first 4 hours—strange and unprofessional! Worse, they did not serve me food. I had attempted online check-in twice to order vegetarian meals, but the system said check-in was only available at the desk. Onboard, when I requested a vegetarian meal, they simply denied my request, stating there was no special order. Even after explaining my situation, they made no effort to help or offer alternatives. The staff didn’t even know the ingredients of what they were serving except beef. I was left starving for the entire flight and felt completely ignored and unwelcome. Adding to the discomfort, the lack of blankets or cushions resulted in severe body pain. Other Disappointments: Unlike airlines such as Virgin Atlantic, British Airways, Etihad, or Swiss Air, the pilots here did not share any information about notable landmarks during the journey. Even after getting a window seat, I did not get a glimpse of the pyramids—a small touch that could have made the experience better. The first half of my journey lacked proper entertainment, and the second half left me hungry. Final Thoughts This is my personal experience and opinion, but I strongly advise choosing a better airline except visiting Egypt itself. A Cairo layover with EgyptAir is not worth it, no matter the extra baggage allowance (few extra Kilos) or a discounted price. You would be left with severe body pain and illness. All the best with your travels!

### “deliberate tactic to exploit passengers”
Not Verified | A Horrible Experience. I recently flew with EgyptAir in December 2024 from Nairobi to Paris, and I must say it was one of the worst travel experiences I’ve ever had. What should have been a straightforward journey turned into a nightmare due to the airline's unreasonable and discriminatory practices. At the Nairobi airport, I was refused boarding unless I booked a return ticket with EgyptAir. I showed them my return ticket, which was with a different airline, but they dismissed it, claiming it "didn’t count. There was no mention of this requirement in their policies or on my ticket, and it felt like a blatant attempt to extort money from me. Despite my protests and explanations, they refused to let me board the plane until I purchased a return ticket with them. Left with no other option, I reluctantly bought the return ticket, which I canceled immediately upon landing in Paris. This entire ordeal was not only frustrating but also completely unnecessary. It felt like a deliberate tactic to exploit passengers, and I cannot help but feel that this would not have happened to a white passenger. The discrimination and lack of professionalism were appalling. EgyptAir needs to address this issue immediately. Their policies should be clear and fair, and their staff should not be allowed to enforce arbitrary rules that are not communicated to passengers beforehand. This experience has left me deeply disappointed, and I will never fly with EgyptAir again.

### “let down, frustrated, deeply disappointed”
Not Verified | Our experience with Egypt Air was nothing short of appalling. Due to a flight delay of over 2.5 hours, we missed our connecting flight and had to spend over $2500 on alternative flights to Bali via Doha, not to mention losing 36 hours of our holiday. The airline claimed the delay was due to "technical issues," but after researching previous flights on the same route, it’s clear this is a recurring problem—a reflection of the consistently poor service provided by Egypt Air. The service we received both on the ground and in the air was disgraceful. The ground staff in Sharm and Cairo were rude and unhelpful, refusing to assist us when we needed help the most. Despite assurances from the flight attendant that we would be met with assistance upon landing, this was a blatant lie. No one was there to help us, leaving us stranded and scrambling to make alternative arrangements. To add insult to injury, the airline’s compensation offer—a 15% discount on future flights—is completely unacceptable and worthless to us, as we live in Australia and have no plans to fly with Egypt Air again. This experience has been one of the worst in all our years of travelling. We feel let down, frustrated, and deeply disappointed. I strongly urge others to think twice before booking with Egypt Air to avoid the stress, financial loss, and outright disregard for customer care that we experienced.

### "trying to recover my luggage"
I was scheduled to fly from Paris to Lebanon with Air France. Unfortunately, my Air France flight was canceled, and I was offered an alternative route: Paris to Cairo with Air France and then Cairo to Beirut with EgyptAir. Upon arriving in Cairo, one of my checked-in luggage items was missing. I filed a claim at the airport expecting a swift resolution. Little did I know this would become a year-long ordeal. Since that day, I have been relentlessly contacting Egypt Air’s Lebanon office, trying to recover my luggage. Every single month I call, only to face repeated requests for the same documents: photos of the luggage, boarding pass copies, luggage tag details (which I’ve sent multiple times). Excuses like, "It’s not my responsibility, talk to my colleague. Empty promises from the office manager that they would "investigate" and get back to me. They never do. Despite all my efforts, I have not received my luggage or any compensation. Instead, I’ve been given the runaround, wasting my time and energy. I didn’t book with Egypt Air, this was a rerouted flight due to Air France’s cancellation. Not only was I forced to endure a significant delay, but Egypt Air’s complete lack of accountability has made this situation unbearable.

### "no announcements from the pilot"
We took MS 840 (JNB to CAI; 05/01/25) economy class. The airplane was sweltering inside, we were left waiting inside for close to an hour due to some AC problem, which the pilot never came on to explain. Even the cabin staff didn’t know what was going on. Then everyone was asked to deplane and remain in the terminal. After about an hour, without an announcement boarding began again. Still hot inside, at least the flight took off, now two hours late. During the above ordeal inside the plane, the washrooms were locked. When asked why this was so, the answer was due to security. After complaints from many passengers, the cabin staff finally relented and opened the bathrooms. Next flight was on MS 787 (CAI to MUC; 10/01/25) business class. The flight boarded two hours late due to the captain’s seat having to be replaced. Again, no announcements from the airport staff and when people inquired, they were unresponsive. People were lined up to board and remained so without any information given. After boarding, there no announcements from the pilot at any time, even a welcome and no explanation for the delay. EgyptAir does not belong in Star Alliance and comes nowhere close to the service that the other members provide.

### "Highly recommended"
I would like to share my positive experience with Egypt Air as this Airline have really exceeded my expectations. Friendly and professional cabin crew with delicious catering. Highly recommended and for sure will fly Egypt Air again.

### "couldn’t use entertainment system"
Arrived three and a half hours early for flight. Check in was however a disaster massive queue - despite being checked in online. It took more than an hour to check in - only when I had been in queue for 45 minutes did a staff member arrive to see if I had checked in online. The only aspect that was speedy was the actual Boarding. Where unlike most airlines they didn’t use the frustrating “geoup” system and let people board after business class. Once seated discovered my screen didn’t work. I alerted cabin crew on two different occasion before take off. No apology and little explanation. As screen didn’t work I couldn’t use entertainment system. Then discovered that power point didn’t. Worn either so I couldn’t use my phone as I needed power when I landed. Then discovered my light didn’t work either as no power and finally discovered that my seat didn’t recline. I alerted Egyptian the day I landed. On the 17th and they came back to me today saying they would offer me a 25% discount on my next flight. Semi automated reply and I don’t actually believe they would honour the discount. So i would say stay away. If the ticket had been cheap it might have been worth it but it wasn’t so. Avoid this unless you really have no other choice.

### "Waiting for compensation"
The entertainment screens didn't work during the whole round trip (the going and the return flights) in our both seats (my husband and mine). Very dirty airplane,  rude and unprofessional crew in the going flight. Worst experience, not worthy at all the ticket price. Will not fly with Egyptair again. Waiting for compensation from their side for thefour non working screens.

### "professional cabin crew"
Excellent service, very cheerful and professional cabin crew. Delicious catering, punctual. Honestly EgyptAir deserves a much better rating. Keep up the excellent work.

### "a somewhat surreal experience"
Original departure time was 19.35 but advised the previous evening of an amended time of 20.30. The day of the flight, this became 22.00 and finally 23.10. Check-in went smoothly and meal vouchers given to each passenger, which was good. Boarding went reasonably smoothly. After that, it was a somewhat surreal experience. Numerous passengers reclined their seats before takeoff. Cabin crew were already seated and so couldn't address this. Meal service was swift and food was pretty good. Quite a few meal trays weren't collected afterwards and remained on tray tables during the approach and landing. A small child remained asleep on the floor between seats across from us through the landing. People stood up and began grabbing items from the overhead bins while the aircraft was still taxiing to the terminal, despite announcements to remain seated. Reasonably good legroom and ok for a short sector. Definitely memorable.

### “cabin crew efficient and friendly”
Not Verified | Routine R/T Cairo-Luxor using economy class, roughly one hour each way. Smooth check-in, efficient boarding, baggage claim without issue. Flight was on-time, plane was clean and comfortable, cabin crew was efficient and friendly. No complaints.

### "destroyed my hand luggage"
EgyptAir destroyed my hand luggage. It arrived at the final destination dirty, missing a wheel, and covered in scratches. After two months, I was reimbursed = $50, which doesn’t even cover the cost of new luggage, let alone the hassle. In addition, I have flown with EgyptAir more than three times, and every single time, they rescheduled the flight in advance. They often do this very close to the departure date=. While the in-flight service is acceptable, I cannot recommend this airline.

### "meal served was a high quality"
Flight Number was MS45 & flight date was 17-09-2024, I did online check in and was easy and smooth, business class lounge was clean with some snacks (pizza, bakeries, cakes, sandwiches) boarding was on-time and well organised. Aircraft age is 8 yrs and was super super clean, very friendly crew, meal served was a high quality of smoked salmon sandwich and Emmental cheese sandwich+chocolate+a very tasty lotus tart and for sure drinks (tea black or green and coffee).

### "crew was friendly and helpful"
Flight date was 15-09-2024 & flight number was MS46. I did online check in, domestic business class lounge was super clean, friendly staff, high quality snacks (cakes, bakeries, sandwiches), boarding was on-time and smooth. A 15 years old aircraft, was super clean only some dust on the window of my seat, cabin crew was friendly and helpful, meal served was a high quality smoked salmon sandwich + Emmental cheese sandwich + chocolate + sweets (hazelnut+pistachio), bathroon was super clean

### "One of the worst airlines"
One of the worst airlines. Flight was supposed to leave at 1pm got delayed to 4pm flight arrived only at 4.45pm and then no boarding. Boarding was only at 5.30 no explanation given and flight left at 6. I had a connection to Aswan which i missed and no one was willing to assist in the airport. Finally got a flight at 11.30pm when arrived at Aswan the luggage was missing. Had to wait till 1.30am to report the issue. Was informed that will deliver the luggage to the airport but never did. Had to pay a cab 600 egp to go and collect the luggage . Never reimbursed as well. I had 4 flights on this airline all 4 was delayed.

### "Terrible service"
Terrible service on aircraft. Spent over 30 mins without AC on board, probably even more but we were feeling the heat through the 30 min. I could see many passengers asking for flight attendants at least 15 minutes before take off, but they were all ignored completely. The flight attendants would look to see where the call coming from, see the bulb and turn around and ignore the passengers completely.

### "missed our train connection"
After one hour of sitting in the airplane, Egyptair returned us to the airport as they need to do a maintenance! After almost 3.5 hours we can start again with the same airplane. No service what so ever. No clear info. This lead to arriving Berlin too late and we missed our train connection. We have sent several complaints, but the maximum we can get is 30% discount on the ticket price excluding fuel and other costs, on other words for a ticket cost 450 Euro, you get around 25 Euro. We will never book our flight with this company again.

### "Service on board was good"
Not Verified |   First time flying with Egyptair and the flight was delayed by 1.5 hours from Heathrow to Cairo. Barely any updates at all. Service on board was good. 3 days later we flew with Egyptair to Hurghada and again a long delay of almost 2 hours and again no updates whatsoever. Shocking communication with their paying customers. Wouldn't use ever again. Just a update would have been nice. Very poor indeed. They should be fined or monitored for frquent delays. Every single flight from Cairo this evening had a long delay.

### "dont book with this airline"
Do not book this airline for connecting flights. We booked a connecting flight with a layover time of 13 hours. After waiting all night, the connecting flight was delayed for another 9 hours. The staff are very rude and unhelpful. If you have an african passport no hotel room for you no matter your flight delay time but for European & Asians you get free hotel room. Please if you respect yourself and your money dont book with this airline.

### “Very poor treatment”
It was a disastrous trip due to an extremely fanatic and rude security officer who was very disrespectful and arrogant. This issue ruined all the joy of visiting Egypt, our homeland. Many foreign travelers sympathized with my husband and me, and they even gave me two pictures of this person because he refused to give me his name when I requested to file a complaint. After much effort, a person named Yehya Farag Abdallah came to us, who went to great lengths to thwart any efforts to lodge a complaint. Very poor treatment and complaints are not allowed.

### “worst airline you can use”
Absolute worst airline you can use. 90% of flights are delayed, no communication, rude counter staff, aeroplanes falling apart and things not working. I will never visit Egypt again due to this national airline and lack of alternative options.

### “will never fly with this airline again”
Not Verified | I have never flown as bad as Egyptair. 2 weeks ago when I flew from Addis Ababa to Amsterdam one luggage was not delivered. I was deeply disappointed. Last week I flew back from Amsterdam to Addis Ababa. My 4 pieces of luggage did not arrive at my destination. After 5 days I didn't get the right answer of where my luggage is. Airline staff did not respond in the right way to trace my luggage. I don't want everyone to get my experience and wish to acknowledge this problem before hand. To be honest I will never fly with this airline again.

### "always be my top choice"
Aircraft had mechanical issues pre-boarding, were delayed on the ground for 5 hrs, boarded the plane for 90 minutes then flight got canceled. The EgyptAir ground Staff were up against angry distressed passengers who knew nothing about how airline handles these situations. Since they were talking in Arabic to other Egyptian Egyptair Employees, there was of profanity used and most of them were more focused on recording videos than solving their issues. They were waiting for the airline to babysit them. Egyptair supplied hotel rooms and transportation to hotels for everyone of them. Still not good enough for the crowd. They want hotel full board (which was already supplied) transportation (supplied) recovery flight (Supplied the next day) and still want a full refund. I admire the Station Manager and his boss for staying professional, attentive, calm and respectful to every one of them no matter how rude they were to them both. Next day they arranged for a recovery flight and the same staff were there with a big apologetic smile and handed vouchers for a snack but still people wanted a refund on top of the flight. They offered refund upon cancellation but these people wanted a refund and a free 12 hrs flight. I have no idea how EgyptAir train their people to remain calm and professional. They did not even call law enforcement on anyone. I felt they done everything at their disposal to accommodate legitimate request not the fancy dreams. Well done EgyptAir and you will always be my top choice flying to Egypt.

### "Overall a decent airline"
Overall a decent airline, but I would prefer not to fly with them again. The positives: the flights were all roughly on time, and on each flight we were served a full meal, and the food was perfectly fine. But beyond that, the service was hit and miss - on all four flights there was only one properly engaged, polished cabin crew - she was excellent, friendly, and enjoyed herself. Everyone else was surly and indifferent. Safety videos were still playing as the plane took off, crew were relaxed about seats being uprights and window shades up, and it all seems rather laid back. The IFE was pretty poor - very limited choice, and very dated. I would hate to be stuck with this on a long-haul flight. Plane interiors were poorly kept - despite being relatively new, they were not well maintained. It was all quite scruffy. So whilst the flights got me to the destination and back, they weren't enjoyable and I would avoid Egyptair in the future.

### “customer service can be improved”
I flew to Cyprus from the United States. This airline wasn’t my first choice, but not many airlines offer flights to Cyprus with a decent price and route. I was not expecting too much from this airline, therefore I was not too disappointed. It’s not horrible, but I’d avoid if I can. They did get me safely from point A to point B, but customer service can be improved. There is no boarding process, and no announcements were made when boarding in Cairo. So I had no idea when my group was called or when to board. Customer service is also sub par. Flight attendants aren’t too friendly and seem to only want to get the job done rather than provide a pleasant experience, which is fine, but it would be nice to have it nonetheless. The food is probably the worst I’ve had on any airline I’ve flown. In all fairness, they’ll get you to your destination without much of a hassle, but I’d only use if I absolutely need to and have no other options. Not to mention, the 12 hour layover in Cairo made the trip all the much longer than it had to have been. The least that could’ve been done is to provide some sort of accommodation or voucher for food. Cairo airport for 12 hours is not fun. In all fairness, they’ll get you to your destination without too much of a hassle, but I’d only use this airline if the price is really good or if I need to go to a destination where not many airlines go, such as Cyprus. It’s whatever to me, I’m not disappointed as I wasn’t expecting much to begin with, but to my avail, I was right to not expect much. It’s an ok airline that gets you from point A to point B, that’s enough.

### "professional and courteous"
I was flying from Toronto, Canada to Lagos on 18th of April, connecting in Cairo, Egypt. The first flight, Toronto to Cairo, was wonderful. The flight attendants were professional and courteous, and the food was great. The passengers were very diverse coming from Toronto, as is expected from the most diverse city in the world. It was one of the best flights I’ve experienced in a while, but upon arriving in Cairo where I boarded my connecting flight to Lagos, it was a completely different experience. On the flight from Cairo to Lagos it is clear that we were given much different service compared to the flight from Canada. The plane was cold and most weren’t even given blankets to stay warm. On my return flight from Lagos to Cairo thinking it would be better, but it was exactly the same. Again, we couldn’t be given a blanket. Once we landed in Cairo the connecting flight was delayed by 6 hours. There was no explanation or compensation for the delay which left us to sleep at the airport overnight. As expected, the connecting flight going to back to Toronto was exceptional, as the treatment was completely different based on the destination it was going to. There is a very clear disparity in treatment of passengers based on where the flight originates and the destination or arrival location.

### "Overall a fair experience"
Reviewing two similar domestic flights: Cairo-Aswan and Hurghada-Cairo. In both cases there was a speedy group check-in. We were bussed to and from the plane at every airport, but boarding was reasonably efficient and the seats were comfortable (seat back video only on the second plane whose seats seemed a bit wider). A piece of cake and a bottle of water were served on each leg by the friendly crews. On the ground, baggage retrieval was quick. While the Hurghada flight operated 10 minutes ahead of schedule, the Aswan flight operated 6 hrs 20 mins late due to a sandstorm in southern Egypt. During the waiting period cheese rolls, Egyptian pickles, fruit juice and water were offered free to passengers. When the plane reached Aswan it was announced that it would not be continuing on its next leg to Abu Simbel. Our tour company (not Egyptair) arranged a bus for the 3 hour onward journey, Overall a fair experience with Egyptair given the sandstorm, but the cancellation of the second leg of the Aswan/Abu Simbel flight could have been better handled.

### "it all went smoothly"
At the airport the queue for business class check-in was a bit chaotic, but a staff member appeared and referred us to an economy counter for very efficient processing. Fast track through security and passport control worked well. The lounge was comfortable but with few food options that were not replenished quickly enough for the hungry passengers. The plane operated an hour late. The onboard welcome was warm and the recliner seat was wide and comfortable. The food was fine. No alcoholic drinks were available. On arrival we were bussed to the terminal, but there was a separate business class bus which made the process easier. Our bags arrived quickly. This was our first experience with Egyptair and it all went smoothly.

### "service has improved tremendously"
Having flown with Egyptair before I had sworn never again. I am pleased to have given it another opportunity and the service has improved tremendously, including the Cairo Airport. I did not use the onboard entertainment, food was good. On arriving to Cairo, I noticed a huge improvement in the airport, clean and more food choice. The Transfer desk and all signs clear. The staff of Egypt air were great and I did not lose any bags so all went well.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  Some of the staff are amazing, friendly, warm, and helpful. Others, not so much. My wife had an issue with her seat, there was urine on her seat, soaking the seat, but the stewardess laughed and walked away rather than help her. On top of that, we had booked 4 seats, under the same family name, at the same time, so the airline made certain we sat as far apart as possible. Terrible service.

### "I was positively surprised"
Normally a traveller with Lufthansa group airlines, I was positively surprised by this flight (Cairo to Doha return). Flights were on time, aircraft well maintained, comfortable seats and acceptable spacing, IFE with good films available. I should even say, easily better flights and service than with LH and LX. However they have a certain casualness about leaving bags in front of bulkheads or in front of the seats on the emergency exit.

### "the worst customer service"
At the check in in Dublin I was told that as the plane was less than half full I could also check in my carry-on bag, so I did. I landed on Friday and my baggage arrived after midnight on Monday. During that time I walked around China in the winter (it was -11 most days) with no coat or thermal clothing. My phone was dying, so I had to find an electronics shop and buy a charger. In three days I didn't hear a word from Egyptair and they ignored my various messages. Eventually, a week later, they responded to my messages by sending a standard "We're sorry for the inconvenience" ignoring the questions I had asked. They sent me a document to complete to claim expenses, but in the form of a jpg, so I then had to find a printer - in China, when I don't speak Chinese- and complete the claim by hand. In 30 years of flying this is the worst customer service I've ever experienced.

### “Snotty and unapologetic”
Not Verified | I'm an Egyptian-American. I choose to fly with Egyptair since I thought that would be patriotic, especially during these tough times. Big mistake! Major failure on all fronts. Mobile app doesn't work so I couldn't reserve my seats. For 6 weeks the staff doesn't answer email or phone (both NY and DC offices). Lost bags on both ways. Pilots are the best but flight attendants are way below bar. They are not well trained and do not understand what it means to provide 'service'. Snotty and unapologetic. Gate processing was too slow. Airplanes are not clean and during the long flight some lavatories were 'unusable' and crew didn't bother to clean them. Food was above average to be honest, much better than food on Lufthansa and British Airways. The on-boarding process takes for ever and is not disciplined. Crew allows people to board with as many as 6 small suitcases, and of course it takes for ever to find space to store all that crazy amount of bags per passenger. I'm quite saddened to be writing this review, however, I'm being honest and hoping that someone, somewhere will realize that this is not the airline that should be the national carrier for the country. Egypt has a very long proud history in aviation but I swear this is the worst airline that I have ever used during over 35+ years of traveling around the world for business and leisure. While I'm at it, why Cairo airport smells like cigarettes as soon as you enter it? Isn't against the law? Why there are people waiting for people to finish their paperwork at the gate of the airplane? (VIP people). For anyone in charge, please try to figure out why are we living in dark ages while the world has moved to the twenty-first century?

### "definitely not worth it"
Not Verified | All in all, Business Class on Egyptair is definitely not worth it! First of all seats were changed last minute even tho we had booked seats as we wanted to sit together! In Business Class, you expect that this service can be provided, instead, turns out they changed the seats so that two crew members could "sleep" on this short haul flight. Aircraft was extremely dirty and welcome drink was missing as well as water bottle, it just seemed very unorganised and extremely rushed. On top of this, the person next to me kept calling even when we were on the runway! I made gesture to the crew and they simply walked past me and shook their hands in the air as if it was 'my problem'. Once in the air, I was being told that windows had to be closed to let people sleep (this was a day flight between 10:00 - 14:00) and I felt this was ridiculous. Toilets were missing paper and the smell, well let's just say it was not great. The food and drinks were not served for the first two hours, and was disappointing for Business Class, especially on a five hour flight! The crew itself seemed to be happy about this and just sat in the front. On top of this, while the plane was only 6 years old, the seats and interior in Business looked very old, as if they had installed their old 2000s livery. All in all, this was the first and last time I am flying with this airline! The safety and comfort you get in Business Class for your money is simply not worth it!

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown with, even as a last resort I would never ever choose to go with this airline again. I flew with them for a total of 17 hours and the staff were incredibly rude. However, the worst part of this airline and trip I took with them was that our luggage was never put on our connecting flight from Cairo to Tokyo, when we arrived at our destination with no baggage we were informed by airport staff that this is a regular occurrence with the airline and they witness it on every single flight from them. We submitted a lost luggage claim both via paper and electronically and we sent several mails and phone calls each day to various addresses and phone numbers for the next 3 weeks in an attempt to get our bags back. They were returned back to our home country in Ireland on a random flight, with no notice or tags etc indicating that they were lost and returned luggage. Only for the fact, that we had contact information on the bags were the staff in Dublin airport were able to contact us and inform us that our bags arrived back so we were able to collect them upon our return. The airline did absolutely nothing to help us, provide us information, compensation or even an apology. It has been 2 months now and I am still contacting the airline daily to get compensation, the handful of times they have responded to me it is to dismiss my case by claiming that I never submitted a claim when I did and stating that they cannot help me. Their complete lack of professionalism across all aspects of their airline is astounding that they are still functioning.

### "Worst experience of my life"
Not Verified |  I highly suggest to avoid Egyptair flights. On the way back to Montreal from Cairo they knew Munich was closed due to snowstorm (emails were sent ~3-4 hours before the flight) so they board us very very early and quickly start the flight before people check their emails. 1 hour before landing in Munich they notify us and tell us they will land in Frankfurt (where we can find air Canada stations). Then halfway through they say we have decided to reroute to Dusseldorf (no air Canada). They land us there and leave us. They tell us go to Egyptair counter they will tell you what to do. When we speak to them what do they say? We are trying but no promises, we are not responsible we are just helping you out, etc. After 8 hours of arguing they left us here stranded. They start engaging with us and start calling air Canada to book flights from Frankfurt to Montreal and a train from Dusseldorf to Frankfurt. A total of 30-40 hours or no sleep and being stranded in an airport with no help. Worst experience of my life. Do not trust them at all.

### "don’t expect to get a good seat"
Not Verified |  Egyptair flies the 737 from Cairo to Copenhagen and if you like to be remembered of the good old days then this is your plane of choice. However most of business class is normally occupied by Egyptair staff so don’t expect to get a good seat as most are taken. Flight was dirty and the same plane a 737 was between Hurghada and Cairo but in much better state than the 5 hour flight to hell from Cairo to Copenhagen. I would rather recommend a cheap airline like Easyjet or Wizzair in the future.

### "Totally avoid"
This the worst airline ever. I have my reservation with them from Cairo to Mumbai in business class. I am trying to call the for last three days and waited on phone for more then 2 hours in waiting and did not get any Customer service agent on line. I decided to E-Mail and it has been a week and still no answer. This Airline may bee cheap but not worth to fly with. Totally avoid.

### "three days to get my luggage to me"
I had a short lay over in Cairo and asked the lady at the check in desk to kindly give my luggage a priority tag to ensure my luggage would reach. She said it was only done in deserving cases. My layover was for an hour only, i dont know what could be more deserving a case. I got to Frankfurt and my luggage did not make it to my destination. It took them three days to get my luggage to me. I was forced to purchase clothes and a few essential items, when I sought compensation, they gave me a misly amount that did not cover even half of what i used to buy the essentials and was sent on my not so merry way. If you want to have a miserable trip, use this airline.

### “worst customer service ever”
The worst customer service ever. They have lost my bag and they are not responding to my emails. I can see where the bag is on the tracking system however they don’t consider responding or compensating my purchases that were in the bag. I thought booking business class will make it a more reliable trip. However, it seems they don’t care whether you’re flying business or not. In addition, the food they serve on business class is below 1 star. Planes are not clean at all, washrooms are really bad.

### "Avoid this airline"
Not Verified |   I'll add my horror story to the never ending list below, but if you're here already, you already know. Got on the plane in New York, but never left the tarmac. Spent 5 hours on the plane before returning to the terminal. 24 hours of lies and misinformation (they disconnected their phones at their office) until the hundreds of passengers almost had a riot. I booked another flight. Emailed them continuously and after two months (legal limit) they gave me a partial refund. Still trying to get the rest of the money they owe me almost three months later. Avoid this airline like the plague.

### "pleasantly surprised"
After all of the horror stories on this site, I wasn't expecting much from this airline, but was pleasantly surprised. First the positives. The flight left and arrived on time. The business section is in the very common 1-2-1 configuration and the pods offer a fair amount of privacy. The seats can be fully reclined for sleeping. The FAs were attentive. Most surprisingly the food was quite good, which can not be said of their domestic flights where I was given rather dried-up sandwiches with a filling of uncertain provenance. Of course, no alcohol is served. Now the negatives. The IFE is limited. What they call international movies all come out of Hollywood. Given Egypt Air's extensive network, I had expected a much better selection of international films. No mattress or seat cover was provided for sleeping (I asked for one).

### "a severe lack of training in handling passengers"
I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and outrage regarding the treatment my husband and I experienced. To provide context, my husband has significant mobility issues and requires a wheelchair and personal assistance for all mobility. Our seat accommodations were specially selected and paid for (seats 20D and 20E) to ensure some level of comfort and ease for him during the flight, considering his condition. During the flight, an unfortunate incident occurred in the washroom, which was exacerbated by the unprofessional and inhumane behavior of the head flight attendant, who was the main person in charge of the cabin crew. My husband, despite his mobility challenges, had to use the washroom alone due to its small size. His lack of balance and stability led to an accidental spill of water in the washroom. Rather than assisting or seeking a suitable solution, the flight attendant approached me with an aggressive and unfriendly tone, ordering me to clean up the mess immediately. I was humiliated and embarrassed, forced to clean the washroom on my hands and knees, which is not only demeaning but also entirely inappropriate given that we had informed the airline of my husband’s condition and limitations. This incident reflects a stark neglect of basic human decency and a severe lack of training in handling passengers with special needs and considerations. Moreover, it was not only us who were subjected to the head flight attendant's deplorable conduct. Throughout the flight, we observed him interacting with other passengers in a manner that can only be described as rude and abrupt. His apparent lack of empathy, customer service, and social skills were not only directed towards us but were also evident in his interactions with numerous other passengers, creating an uncomfortable and hostile environment aboard. This is not only a stark deviation from the expected service standards of your airline but also a blatant disregard for basic courtesy and professionalism. Such behavior, especially from a staff member in a position of authority and leadership, is utterly unacceptable and tarnishes the reputation of Egyptair. This is not the level of service we expected from Egyptair, and it is certainly not acceptable under any circumstances. The emotional distress and humiliation we experienced during the flight were immeasurable and will not be forgotten easily.

### "zero comfort, staff are rude"
No one should ever book a flight with Egyptair unless you want to be mentally and physically harassed. Ridiculous staff, rude and clueless about everything. Flight was delayed from 11.40-14.40. Then after asking us to proceed to the boarding gate and announcing like idiots that they will deny boarding for people who arrive at the gate later than 25 mins to boarding, they delayed the flight by 1.5 hours more. When asked about status, the ground staff said we have no information. Their seats don’t recline properly, zero comfort, staff are rude. There is no reason for people to take this airline. I’d rather pay double than ever take Egyptair again.

### "worst customer service ever"
This was my first time and last time flying with Egyptair. I have never written a review on anything my whole life, but this experience was so bad that I had to. The staff members In the airport are like a gang all they want is for you to give them money. The worst airline and the worst customer service ever.

### "a very disappointed client"
I had a normal flight all the way (slept most of the times) so did not notice other extra things, I was very tired until I arrived at my destination without two of my three luggage. I had to go to write a statement at 2 O'clock in the morning, they assured me they will trace the bags and contact me. After two days they called me and told me they have found my bags and they will deliver them to the address I provided, I was very impressed until one of the bags was not mine so I had to file another statement. Its been 2 months 2 weeks since then and I have not heard from anyone from Egyptair and am not sure I will, I have emailed them more than 10 times but no respond. That was my first worst experience ever am not flying that airline ever again. Advice to the airline you need to have open communication with your clients, its the only way of solving the problem and reply at least to one of their emails/msg, we are the ones missing our luggage, we need to know what's happening. Am a very disappointed client.

### "Worst airline experience"
Worst airline experience I have ever had and customer service was very poor. The aircraft was old and dirty. No one bothered to clean the lavatories despite being shared by very many people. We were made to wait for more than an hour to be transferred to the business class lounge in Cairo.

### "my experience was horrible"
I had return ticket From JFK to DAC and both ways my experience was horrible. I had my elderly relative (80+ year old), wheelchair passenger who were not attended at the Cairo Airport properly, the Trolley driver at the Cairo airport was yelling with other staff at the airport in local language and drove the trolley like crazy. Wheelchair supposed to be gate to gate, but he dropped us off in a area near the elevator and left us by ourselves. There was lounge for business class, foods were awful, Bathrooms even worse. Near to our flight time, when nobody came with wheelchair, we had to ask the front desk to request a wheelchair for us, but they didn't, we were late to arrive at our departure gat. A few hours into our flight to JFK, twoout of three restrooms were Out Of Order! Flight attendants did not have professional attitude, sitting around most of the flight. Seats do not work properly, some buttons works, some doesn't! No information on what kind of food they will serve, and they have no wine etc. Inflight Entertainment very old and poor system, sound system will hurt your ear.

### "our flight was canceled"
We had a return with Egyptair Brussel-Entebbe via Cairo. On the first flight everything was ok; the food, friendliness of the stewards etc. Our luggage arrived a day later in Entebbe but the hotel told us that this happened by all airplane companies. The problem was the flight back a month later on the 18th of August. We where in an area with no internet but on August 10 we read that on August 3 an email was send that our flight was canceled. Egyptair proposed a flight on August 26, 8 days later. Because they announced it more than 14 days before, refund was not possible. Our intermediair Cheaptickets arranged tickets for us for the 19th but shortly after that they said that Egyptair said it was fully booked. On their site the flight was still offered for a high price. The same happend with the next booking for August 21. In the end we booked an expensive flight from another company. Cheap tickets will try to get a refund for us. The height of this wil be far below the extra costs we have made. What bothers me is that Egyptair tries to sell seats against a high price but also says that the flight is fully booked.

### "common pattern delaying luggage"
Surviving EgyptAir If you care about your mental well-being, safety, and belongings, then DO NOT EVER FLY WITH EGYPTAIR. My girlfriend and I flew with EgyptAir on Thursday 27th July 2023 from London to Accra (MS780 and MS881) with a layover in Cairo. When we landed in Accra the following day, our luggage did not appear on the conveyer belt. This was also the case for over fifty fellow passengers. We were told by Aviance Ghana staff members (the airline ground handling company at Accra Kotoka International Airport) that all the luggage had arrived and we would have to file a property irregularity report (PIR). EgyptAir’s website states that "in the event that your checked bags do not arrive on your flight, EGYPTAIR will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the bag is returned to you within 24 hours. However, this was not fulfilled as our checked baggage was not on the flight which arrived on Saturday 29th July 2023. As the majority of our two-week trip was scheduled to be in Kumasi, we headed to our destination and had someone check for our bags each day there was an incoming flight to Accra from Cairo (Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday). The email communication from EgyptAir is below par. It took over ten emails to get a response from the different email addresses I had messaged. The London email account was slightly helpful, but could not provide any information on where my bags were as they said the baggage email account had that information. Their social media pages copy and paste the same message, advising to contact the email the baggage team. The baggage team email did not respond until Tuesday 5th August 2023, despite having emailing them and other accounts since Sunday 30th July 2023. They had requested for our bag tags, yet they never responded to my email with the attached bag tags. I tried tracking the bags using my bag tag numbers on their app and it didn’t work. Even if you check on World Tracer it says “your airline is not supporting this service. Please contact the airline’s website for further information.” The bags eventually arrived on Monday 7th August 2023, but my girlfriend and I each had a bag damaged. We were offered temporary compensation by EgyptAir, equating to 100 USD in Ghana Cedis. Our experience with EgyptAir was not unique and they have a common pattern delaying and damaging passenger’s luggage. If you check tweets, countless people flying to destinations across Europe, Africa and America have had their bags lost, damaged or delayed. Even people in the queue waiting for the PIR in Accra said they frequently delay your bags because they have small aircrafts and only bring in luggage on big aircrafts. DO NOT FLY WITH EGYPTAIR. You are better off training to become a pilot, buying your own aircraft and flying to the destination yourself than having a pleasant experience in EgyptAir. Now battling to receive compensation from EgyptAir for delayed and damaged bags. Evening rating them 1/10 is not a fair rating.

### "crew was rude and not smiling"
Not Verified | Beside the 1h and half delay and the lack of air conditioning, the most horrible experience was the customer service onboard, the crew was rude and not smiling at all, not helpful, rolling their eyes when we ask questions and staying behind eating and laughing between them. I had to go by myself 4 times to ask for water, even when I was pressing the button for calling them they never came. I am travelling around the globe and I never lived something like that. Shame on you Egyptair to have these incompetent people on board. Not even a smile! Egyptair never again

### "Flight attendants have a bad attitude"
Not Verified |  Incompetent ground personnel at customer service and ticket counters. Flight attendants have a bad attitude. Pilots totally ignore passengers: No public Announcement is being made. Flights are systematically delayed. Bags delivery on the carousel takes forever. No electrical outlet, WiFi, or entertainment during the flight.

### "flight attendants were quite rude"
Check-in staff at Dubai were nice but that's it! First of all when booking tickets on Egypt Air, it is very strange that they want a residence address at the destination. Considering most people are tourists, they wouldn't have an address. And most people book their flights before their hotel. So you have to just make up an address! Other sites offering the same flights don't even ask for this. Once you've booked the flight, after the first email, which shows your correct luggage allowance every other the confirmation email keeps saying "no luggage details can be found", which is concerning so to make sure I drove to Central London's Egypt Air office to confirm my luggage allowance because they NEVER pick up the phone or reply to emails! On the flight from London to Dubai via change-over at Cairo, they delayed my baby's stroller by more than a day. By the time we received it, it was the end of the following day. So we had to carry the baby around for 2 days everywhere we went, along with other bags and 3 other kids. This made our first 2 days of our holiday VERY difficult. Once folded the stroller is one of those extremely compact ones, easyily within cabin size but gate staff refused us to take it on the plane, which also meant we couldn't use it in Cairo transit either. We contaced Egypt Air regarding the delayed stroller but they didn't even reply after over a month of waiting, let alone offer ANY compensation. Some of the flight attendants on the flights were quite rude, they acted like they REALLY didn't want to be there. A simple request of a glass of water would be given to you with a dirty look. The staff wouldn't want to serve you tea or coffee either. Worst experience on any flight. Had I been offered even a little compensation I would've been satisfied and just forgotten the Flight treatement, but they didn't even have the courtesy to respond. Food also lacked any real flavour.

### "Friendly and efficient on-board staff"
I was nervous to fly with Egyptair with so many negative reviews but it went really well. Flights on time from Tel Aviv to Cairo and back. Clean and modern aircraft. Friendly and efficient on-board staff. Lounge access (Star Alliance Gold) granted with "OK" experience. The boarding gate was chaotic. It was unclear when we were about to board (lots of flights using same gate).

### "Good flight, high allowance for luggage"
Good flight, high allowance for luggage, reasonable meals and entertainment and acceptable level of hospitality and cleaning. The flight was on time and reasonable check in and luggage collection process

### "seats and windows were disgustingly dirty"
I fail to understand how Egyptair meets the minimum standards for Star Alliance. The boarding process was 15 minutes late with no communication to passengers. The plane smelt and the seats and windows were disgustingly dirty (I have pictures). There was only water and sweetened juice offered to the passengers to drink. No soft drinks to offer passengers. The boarding process was not directed or organized by anyone. The group letters for boarding were not used. First come-first serve so it was like boarding a herd of cows.

### "I am getting no response"
Had a very long delay on Egyptair flight MS 758 because of incorrect boarding procedures of the ground crew. Because of this I missed my connecting Egyptair flight. Unfortunately I am getting no response to my valid claim for financial compensation.

### "last flight with this airline"
Our flight from Dubai to Greece with stop over in Egypt was delayed for 2hrs and all our baggage were delayed for 1day. We have nothing when we arrived in Greece. I thought this will be the last worst experience with this airline. Our return flight from Milan to Dubai with stop over for 1:45hr in Egypt was delayed in boarding gate for 30mins only but when we arrived at Egypt airport the flight to Dubai was already closed so we waited for next flight which is after 6hrs and the only compensation was to rebook for next flight. No other offer from this airline. This will be our last flight with this airline. I will not waste my money.

### "no one from the crew cared"
Not Verified | The airline staff in Jeddah made more than one mistake. 1. They split the passengers and forced them to another delayed flight 2. They lied by saying the first flight is cancelled while it was on 3. They had another time listed in the boarding pass to avoid conferring with customers 4. They failed to share any of the above unless you step up and ask for more information 5. They didn’t have enough team on the ground to handle the boarding 6. Everyone felt they are being treated badly and no one from the crew cared to help or explain the situation

### "has zero regard for passenger comfort and well-being"
The discomfort started aboard. The seating arrangement was cramped and uncomfortable, offering minimal legroom compared to that of other airlines. As if that weren't bad enough, the seats were worn-out, tattered, and reeked of an unpleasant odour. Furthermore, there were no air vents above the seats. It was clear that Egyptair has zero regard for passenger comfort and well-being. It all seemed like I had booked with a budget airline. The in-flight entertainment system was a joke. The screens were tiny and outdated, with a limited selection of movies and shows. To add insult to injury, the system malfunctioned, leaving me bored and unable to distract myself from the unending hours of discomfort. See the photo attached for reference. Now, let's talk about the abysmal quality of the food. I understand that airplane food is typically subpar, but Egyptair took it to a whole new level of awfulness. First, I was given a completely different meal (fish) than what I had ordered (beef). Then why bother even asking what I want? The food kept sliding off the low-quality table trays, so I had to eat single-handedly while holding the tray in place. The meals were tasteless, unappetizing, and resembled something one might find in a school cafeteria or a construction site. It was a struggle to stomach the barely edible slop that was served, and I would have gladly gone hungry if given the choice. Half of each meal was returned as is. I ordered sparkling water with my meal, which they did not have. I was given a coke instead. In-between meals I had not even been asked a single time if I wanted something to drink. To make matters worse, the flight attendants were extremely rude, racist, unhelpful, and indifferent to the needs of passengers. They seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than providing any form of customer service. There was no greeting or even the slightest smile when boarding. The same was the case when getting off the airplane. Requests for assistance from passengers around me were met with eye-rolls and sighs, leaving me feeling like a burden rather than a paying customer. It was clear to all that the staff did not feel like working. Impatience, anger, disrespect and disinterest are amongst others what characterized them all, without a single exception. I even witnessed two of the female staff members, who did not speak the language of the departure country and were far from fluent in English themselves, pressingly tapping random passengers on their shoulders following with: 'you, translate now! Other times the output was: 'food, you', 'drink? Drink?'. Blatantly shouting by the flight attendants was common on this flight, even at the elderly. The people next to me were the sweetest but were treated so condescendingly due to the language barrier. It really broke my heart. In response to them asking if there maybe was a spot where one could pray, the flight attendant remarked 'Where? No, you must do it here', whilst rolling her eyes. Are you serious? The utter lack of any semblance of empathy and professionalism was mind-boggling. It baffles me how these incapable flight attendants are still working in this industry. If it weren't for them I wouldn't even have bothered to write this review at all. In conclusion, I cannot express my disappointment enough. I strongly advise anyone considering flying with Egyptair to think twice and explore other options. You deserve better than the nightmare I endured.

### "Nothing was provided by the airline"
My flight from Cairo to Toronto was delayed 4.5 hours a few days before the flight schedule. Then it was delayed two hours the morning of the flight date. Nothing was provided by the airline except for a rude personnel telling me I have no accommodations. I had to purchase a one day pass for me and my daughter for $160 to rest since the layover became 10 hours instead of 5. This was my first trip with this airline and will be the last. Drinks on the plane included only Guava juice and water and the food was average. Getting off the plane in Toronto, we had to take the bus for about 20 minutes to get to the terminal. It was an hour and a half from the time we landed to the time we get to the baggage claim area. They have 2 phone numbers for customer service in Toronto. I kept calling them a few times a day for a few days before the flight to pick my seats and they were always busy. The only time the phone rang is when there was a holiday and heard a message saying the office is closed.

### "EgyptAir flight was delayed"
The departure time was 10:55 a.m., but I was half an hour late in boarding till 11:35 a.m., and we stayed more than half an hour on the plane. At twelve o'clock, the captain announced a 45-minute delay. Because the EgyptAir flight was delayed, I missed the flight to New York, which cost me money. Spending an entire day in Germany at my own expense in an airport hotel and Postponing my trip to New York the next day resulted in financial losses.

### "lost my luggage 30 days ago"
Egyptair is a subpar airline. They lost my luggage 30 days ago and since then it's impossible to get a hold of them. Their number in Toronto does not seem to work and they never answer their email. I was warned that it was a bad airline but this is on another level. The worst airline I have taken so far. Avoid at all cost.

### "my baggage still hasn't arrived"
Egyptair is the worst airline I have ever travelled with. You can't reach them via phone in Toronto and email will take days to get a response and when you do, it's always a robotic email, like no one takes the time to understand the specific issue. My flight was from Toronto to Lagos via Cairo, the first part of the flight to Cairo was great, but as soon as you arrive Cairo at your gate to an African destination like Lagos, the terrible treatment begins. Upon arrival at Lagos, hundreds of bags didn't arrive with the plane. It's been over a week since my arrival to Lagos and my baggage still hasn't arrived, Egyptair doesn't have the courtesy to advise over multiple emails and phone calls on the status of the bag. The Lagos Airport is providing information this is normal and they are lots of Egyptair customers calling them as well for their bags. This is not an airline to patronize.

### "Excellent service"
Excellent service, professional crew, respect in all matters, reasonable prizes, comfortable seats, restroom clean. Will travel indeed again with Egyptair.

### "the flight was excellent"
Other than an hour delay for departure waiting for a few transfer bags the flight was excellent. Old 737. Ancient actually. But plush seats and great service. Welcome aboard drinks. Drinks and lunch about 30 min after take off. Delicious mezze and choice of chicken, mixed grill or salmon. Chicken was tasty and pasta good. FA served you with a smile and genuine hospitality. Seats are old style so don’t recline a lot and the footrest was broken. Inflight entertainment was minimal so I watched Netflix on my phone. Arrived an hour late. Priority bags off in 20 min. Value was great as i paid $250 and then a $200 upgrade offer. Good job Egyptair.

### "I was very uncomfortable"
I was very uncomfortable while going to Toronto. My layover was 22 Hours in Cairo international airport. They are supposed to give us hotel for that time. But I had to wait for 6 hours till i got into my room. And leave the hotel 2 hours before for my next flight. The wait in the lobby was horrific. No comfortable seats. The staff at the airport was the worst, I asked them about my room the guy literally yelled at me. Later after 5 hours, they gave me my hotel along with others. At the hotel there was no veg food. Just bread and salads and vegetables. The return flight to India had 12 hours lay over this was even more worst than before. Out of the 12 hours i had to wait for 5 hours at the lobby. And even after that, they didnt give me a room saying they didnt approve my transit visa for the hotel. That just didnt make sense as i had got transit visa before while going to Toronto. Luckily i had my lounge access and even the lounge was not comfortable. It was just a small hall with a small counter of food. The meals were absolute mediocre and bland.

### "offered a non-vegetarian meal"
On flight from Cairo to Mumbai, we were offered Beef in our meal despite we opted Vegetarian meal option. On top of all, the behavior of crew members was extremely rude and arrogant It was complete chaos. Before we were served the meal, we were observing that the hostess was not serving passengers as per their preferred meal selection, rather she was simply asking for the meal passenger of the passengers: a Vegetarian meal or a non-vegetarian meal. Whereas people like us, who don’t eat any non-vegetarian food were offered a non-vegetarian meal.

### "Meal was very bad"
Business class counter occupied by many economy class passengers. Wheel Chair was supplied but the attendant disappeared. Voucher for Lounge simply covers a drink and single piece of food or biscuits or cakes. Aircraft looks very old. Entertainment system was not functioning. Meal was very bad. Among several juices suggested by hostess, I opted for the Mango. I got something which I was told it was cocktail and it's the only juice available. I asked for Pepsi diet or Cola zero but not available. Toilet is small. Luggage took long time to arrive though it was clearly labeled as Business class and priority labels. Other airlines on the same route offer much better services.

### "been on hold for well over 2 hours"
I booked a flight for NY to Cairo, and a return from Luxor to New York, via Cairo. Egyptair changed my flight times so my flight to Cairo now lands at 4:30 AM (unfortunate, but workable), but my flight from Cairo to New York now departs before my flight from Luxor to Cairo. When informing me of this change, they told me I had to call to figure out my options - no way to email or do virtually. I have called multiple times. Many times, I simply got a busy signal and was disconnected. When I managed to get through, I was put on hold. I have been on hold for well over 2 hours (I called first at 9:10 AM, later at 11:40, again at 2:20 PM, again at 4:10). On the 2:20 call, I actually got a person, who hung up after I said hello and made no effort to call back. I have no idea how to resolve this issue short of cancelling my trip, paying Egyptair for a flight I cannot use, or being stranded in Luxor.

### "not liable to pay me any compensation"
Absolutely terrible aftercare and customer service. My bag has been lost as it did not make the flight to Larnaca. I had people from EgyptAir sending me photos of the bag in Cairo, but they never managed to send it to me in the UK. I have now been told that on 8/11/22 it was sent to Saudi Arabia and would be 'irretrievable' but that as I only submitted a 'courtesy tracking request' initially, they were not liable to pay me any compensation. Why would the original 'lost baggage claim' just be a tracking request.

### "economy seating comfortable"
Not Verified |  I found the economy seating to be comfortable however they separate travellers who have not paid for seats which only led to passengers swapping seats before take off. I hadn’t expected a meal but received a very good quality meal with water and coffee. Staff were busy yet polite and the whole flight was enjoyable. On return however half the passengers had a coughing bug, the plane was not clean and children had been separated from their parents which led to more shuffling. The food on this leg was inedible. The worst thing was that there was no water provided and passengers had no opportunity to buy water as there were no facilities after passport control in Luxor. I still think this is a good airline as long as you’re not bothered where you sit so would probably use them again

### "I will never use Egyptair"
We were scheduled for our initial flight #850 from Nairobi to Cairo at 4:25 a.m. in business class, minutes before boarding the airport display showed one hour delay, and according to the staff from Egyptair, a flat tire needed to be replaced. Hours had passed by with no real indication as to what the situation was and passengers had become very frustrated demanding answers. After five long hours, one of the executive representatives of Egyptair mentioned to all of the passengers they were going to put up in a hotel because they couldn't find a spare tire for the aircraft. We waited another two hours for the bus transportation and hotel accommodations. The whole deal was horrifying with the transition of getting a new visa to enter back into the country. The business class lounge had no real accommodating, nourishing food. It was basically appetizers and finger food that couldn't hold our nurturing standers for the long hours. The bus transportation had no A/C we were stuffed with our luggage and belongings into the bus like sardines being on top of each other not having any personal space or being mindful of COVID-19. I will never use Egyptair or recommend it to anyone.

### "terrible service"
My flight was redirected to Washington and then Egyptair sent me on a bus to New York airport, I was supposed to arrive in New York at 3.20, instead I arrived on a bus after 9 hours at 11.30 in JFK airport, which is ridiculous you made me late to my appointments and made me super exhausted, I am very dissatisfied and disappointed in Egyptair and I would not recommend anybody to fly with them, everybody on that flight deserves a refund for the trouble they were put through, the least you could do is reach out and apologize about the terrible service.

### "uncomfortable and frustrated"
My husband and I flew from Amman to Mumbai with Egypt Air 2 weeks ago and had a so-so experience in business class. The only disappointment was the main entree which was inedible. Other than that we were able to lay down and sleep, which made the flight better. However, the horrible experience was on the return flight today (2/17/23) from Mumbai to Cairo in an old Boeing 737. The plane was terribly old, the seats awfully uncomfortable it was a red eye flight and we couldn’t even lay down. And this was Business Class! We were uncomfortable and frustrated that this could even be called a business class flight! On top of that, the TV screen was horribly small and the earphones didn’t work. I couldn’t sleep and I couldn’t entertain myself to pass the miserable time onboard. Surprisingly, the short segment from Cairo to Amman was on a newer plane (Airbus 320) and the seats allowed for comfortable reclining and the TV screens were much better along with the movie selection. Why use a better plane for a short segment (1 hour and 15 minutes) but use an old dilapidated plane on a red eye flight?

### "I have not received the funds"
I asked to postpone my flight for a later date and they then told me that they had refunded me (1 month later and after me following up every week because they just do not respond to emails), I have not received the funds and I have been communicating with them back and forth since September 2022, they told me that the refund was made in October 2022, it is now January 2023 and I have still not resolved this issue. They now tell me that they have refunded me and no deposits will be made on their behalf.

### "Crew was friendly and polite"
After reading reviews I had no expectations, but for my surprise, they were not that bad. Plane was a brand new A220, roomy, clean, with good smell. Maybe directly from the factory I would say. The flight arrived on time but we departed with some 20 minutes delay, it seems to be the norm with Egyptair. Crew was friendly and polite, the ground staff is indifferent, and there is no boarding announcements, they just shout that the flight is boarding and good luck with that. Onboard we got a bottle of water and biscuits which is rare these days. Well, I would only fly them again if the price is right.

### "an absolutely horrible experience"
The return flight was delayed without explanation > 1.5 hours with no explanation from ground staff. The planes (having flown several) are comedically dated and dirty (think worn cloth seats, chipped plastic, and the faint smell of cigarettes). Staff never apologize for a delay and instead are abrupt and/or raise their voice should passengers try to inquire about delays or make alternate arrangements. All in all, an absolutely horrible experience and some of the worst customer service of all time.

### "a blemish on the Star Alliance brand"
I have flown extensively, but this Egyptair experience might have been the worst pre-departure experience I have ever encountered. The Egyptair customer service philosophy seems to be something along the lines "ignore customers whenever possible and if you absolutely must interact with a customer - be as rude as possible. Aside from the unorganized boarding process, we cleared security at our gate only to then learn of a gate change after our boarding time had passed. Rather than send a bus to collect passengers that had already cleared security, a daft airline "supervisor" elected to have passengers leave the secure gate area and then walk to the opposite end of the airport and have everyone re-clear security. We were then held at the gate without any explanation for > 1 hour. Any attempt to speak to the Egyptair representatives at the gate were met either with a "shooing hands" motion or -- in several cases - raised voices instructing passengers to "SIT DOWN. Hours later, when we boarded our plane, the captain informed us that our delay was due to "delays in baggage loading. An excuse that was categorically false but, then again, "our staff are inept" isn't something he could say over the PA system. The in-air experience is rubbish. There is no Wifi. The seats are old and worn. The cabin crew seem miserable. The food is inedible. There is no in-flight entertainment. The branding geniuses behind the Egyptair product seem very proud of the fact Egyptair is a Star Alliance partner - but I can't comprehend why. The Egyptair product is garbage and the customer service is horrible. Hopefully this is a partnership that will end because Egyptair can only be described as a blemish on the Star Alliance brand.

### "were delayed for two hours"
The planes from Luxor were delayed for two hours, once you ask the airline people they say an hour, then you figure out it is two. People were on the floor as no where to sit. People missed their connection flights, They canceled my plane to Amman, we were asked to go to customer once in Cairo, no one was there it was 2 am I had a young daughter with me. It is horrible

### "a disgrace of an airline"
There are many things wrong with this airline. First, their boarding process at JFK was an absolute mess as they did not have boarding groups, so everyone was rushing and pushing to get into the plane. The plane is very outdated and dirty with no Wi-Fi connection even for long flights. Of the dozens of airlines I’ve flown on, Egyptair has the worst cabin crew. They don’t engage with passengers and always seem to have an attitude. When serving water, coffee, or tea they do not bother to ask every passenger. They also do not stay on top of safety protocols and I caught three of them playing games on their phones when they should’ve been getting passengers situated. Lastly, they failed to deliver every bag for passengers on the leg from CAI to LOS as they only loaded bags for passengers who flew that same route the day before. Apparently this was because of a load issue that wasn’t even addressed to us until much later on. Don’t even bother contacting customer service because they will not respond or they’ll only send an automated message. This is a disgrace of an airline.

### "didn't want to engage with anyone"
My flight from Heathrow was scheduled on Saturday 10/12/22 at 1400. But this was delayed. As a result I missed my connection flight at Cairo and had to spend over 5 hours at the airport. The staff at the airport were absolutely rude. No explanation, no curtesy, no respect at all. They simply didn't want to engage with anyone. We were commanded to hand in our passports and the new boarding passes with no explanation at about 22:15 PM. At about 02:20 AM two staff came back and commanded us to follow them through immigration. We were taken to another area and told to WAIT. After 03:00AM a small mini bus arrived and we were told 'bus to hotel' the ride was very uncomfortable with passengers sitting on each others laps. We were served a meal at the hotel and went to sleep. We spent the next day Sunday 11/12/22 at the hotel until 18:00PM when were taken back to the airport to catch a flight at 21:45PM arriving at my final destination at 03:15 AM on 12/12/22. To add to my agony, one of my bags was missing so I had to go through more distress completing paper work for missing baggage. The bag was delivered, though. The experience has by far been the worst ever especially the appalling customer service. Will never ever use this airline and if anyone intends to use this airline consider your options very carefully, after all there is a good choice from other airlines.

### "very impressed with the service provided"
Not Verified |  After looking at the reviews we were a little nervous flying with this Airline. However the plane was comfortable and clean. The staff efficient and friendly. The food was excellent. The inflight entertainment was varied and good quality. The return trip from Luxor was just as good. People always write a review if things go wrong, but I would like to thank Egypt air for two great trips. Both myself and my wife were very impressed with the service provided.

### "arrive in Ghana to no luggage"
Booked a flight from London to Ghana with the stop over in Egypt. Only to arrive in Ghana to no luggage and no one had any information as to where the luggage could be. This made us extremely unhappy.

### "Terrible inflight service"
Not Verified | Terrible service. Just terrible. We had one visibly and understandably overworked crew attending to the entire economy class. Only one. She didn't have time for questions, I asked twice for water and was completely ignored. If you were looking away for a minute, she passed without offering you food or tea etc. They serve water right at the end when collecting dirty dishes, so I was practically choking on my food as I don't drink juice they offered with food. No choice of beverage either, just the juice packet you get in the food pack. Terrible inflight service

### "Do not fly with Egypt Air"
Not Verified |  I have never witnessed such chaos and disorganization in my many years of extensive travel. When boarding time came for our flight, there was an attendant at a gate which initiated passengers lining up for boarding (no flight info, however). The attendant then directed us to another gate which then had our flight info on the screen. 20 min passed and no boarding occurred although passengers were lined up. No attendants were in sight. Buses would drive by the gate with no passengers. People took a seat in line and certain passengers started asking questions to a random airport worker. They had no answers. We could see the plane but no one was working in the airport. Eventually, 2 hours later, a man appeared from outside and informed that the two flights leaving for Cairo were being merged. The first scheduled flight would board first followed by the second. No one could understand him; however, so a passenger had to translate for the crowd. Another passenger had to organize the boarding line in order of priority. People were panicked and rushed the line. The same passenger told everyone to line up and stay calm. There was no communication from the airline of the delay or the cancellation of the later flight. They only showed up 2 hours after the first flight was scheduled and couldn’t explain after the fact nor create order. Passengers took the situation into their own hands. There was no apologies from the crew once on the flight. We took several flights with Egyptair, all of which were significantly delayed but this was another level. We missed our connecting flight and had to book an expensive international flight last min. Do not fly with Egyptair!

### "food on board was very tasty"
I traveled with them in July 2022 on the Boeing B737-800 from Amman to Cairo ( Flight Number: MS702) Although the flight was short (about an hour and a half), the level of service on board was more than wonderful, the food on board was very tasty. The flight crew was excellent and very nice.

### "4 flights with them and they were all delayed"
Not Verified |  The worst service experience I have had! I had 4 flights with them and they were all delayed. Most of the staff were rude. The flight attendant ignored me when I asked for water multiple times. The flight coordinator actually threatened me. It took me 3 hours to check in even though there were less than 10 people in front of me and they had 4 open windows. After all the hustle they put me through they lost my luggage. When it was found after 8 days the luggage and most of its contents was damaged. When I informed the customer service all of these they didn't care at all. I would rather walk 8000 miles than fly with them. I don't even know how they are in business treating customers like this.

### "every flight had a delay"
Not Verified |  It is 4th time in a row . And every flight had a delay. We missed our transfer at Tanzania. And no responsible to communicate. No staff speaks English, also in check in the worker put different seats as we applied together as a couple. Terrible services

### "Terrible meals"
Unfriendly staff who you have to ask twice for water, etc. Terrible meals (I had a beef lasagna that was inedible), uncomfortable seating, a poor infotainment system and (no one had informed us). This was an alcohol-free flight. The state of Cairo International Airport  was equally as poor (toilets, lounges, staff friendliness, cafes, etc).

### "8 hours late after hellish experience"
All went perfectly until transfer at Cairo. Connecting flight left us behind because Egyptair was an hour late leaving Heathrow. From therein it was total chaos and arrived Entebbe 8 hours late after hellish experience not made any easier by the unhelpful Egyptair attitude to customer service. They literally do not care at ALL whether they fail and let down their customers.

### "infotainment system was a disaster"
I started on my 1st flight on the morning of the 23rd September, the flight attendants not welcoming in any way. The plane was a 777,it was old and the infotainment system was a disaster, it hardly worked and when it did there was nothing but old shows and rubbish to watch. The plane did not have individual aircon and it felt like I was in a Sauna for 12 hours. Being hot as hell they do not offer drinks, only water and juice. I had to get up, waking the old man next to me, just to get water, and when I asked the guy for water it was like I asked if I could sleep with his wife. Oh My word what a horrific flight. Cairo to Johannesburg, the plane was a 787 so it was up market, but we had a 1 hr delay on the plane before take off, with only the captain coming online telling us we have a 15 min delay and he was sorry. Only male flight attendants and  we got soggy sandwiches wrapped in plastic. Then offering coffee they ran past us not even giving you a chance to ask. Morning breakfast was a roll with a thick slice of cheese and some fruit.

### "Most uncomfortable economy class"
Most uncomfortable economy class flight I have ever had in my life. Seats have been made smaller. Every person in economy, left the plane and commented about how small the seats were on the new planes.

### "not accepting any claim for compensation"
Not Verified |  Our bags were missing on arrival on July 2nd, and we’ve been calling and emailing EgyptAir every day but no answer. We were visiting Toronto for 3 weeks and our trip has been ruined due to this incident. We have been informed by the airport claims desk that 2 bags is arriving on 7th July (5 days late), then another 2 bags arrived 10 days late and the last bag arrived 14 days late. This is unbelievable that EgyptAir has never had any empathy concerns to write back to one of the emails and apologize for what happened. My family and I have suffered from this delay which caused us extra money to purchase all necessities due to this delay and finally, EgyptAir is not accepting any claim for compensation despite providing them all the supporting documents they requested, the reason they said that I am Canadian and traveling to Canada.

### "not recommend this airline"
As Soon as I booked the flight they didn't tell me it was going to be delayed! I even booked the flight several hours before boarding. Within I was checking in, they told me it was going to be delayed for 2 hours which turned out to be 6 hours! I will not recommend this airline. Because of them, I missed my business meeting.

### "such a poorly run company"
Lost our bags on the second leg of our trip from Cairo to JFK. we got 2 that found their way home but 3 are still missing and we are going on a week now with no assistance from EgyptAir. We filed a missing bag report with them on the 29th at the JFK airport and the gentleman there gave me a number to call 718-360-8927 that number goes to VM and the mailbox is full, been that way for over 3 days now. I have spent 8 hours a day for the past 3 days trying to get someone at Egypt air to even acknowledge that they lost our bags. At one point, they blamed it on another airline and denied our claim, literally the only response we got was them telling us that it wasn’t their responsibility. I have never in my life seem such a poorly run company in my life. When you have the bag tag info and everything is scanned and tracked, how do not help find my bags!

### "compensated me with a transit flight"
Not Verified |  I arrived to the checkout point 2 hours before the takeoff time and they wouldn’t let me board because there was an overbooking they said. They basically sold more tickets than the right number of the passengers. I had to miss an important meeting because of them. I had a direct flight and they compensated me with a transit flight. Don’t fly with them if you plan to travel on the flight you actually booked.

### "flight was cancelled before I even booked"
Not Verified | Moscow to Johannesburg via Cairo. Booked a flight for 24 March 2022 - flight was cancelled before I even booked but online accepted payment. They did not indicate that flight was cancelled. I asked for refund online and received confirmation that my account will be credited within 21 days. I have not yet received payment and today is 30 July 2022. Except for initial confirmation my emails and phone calls remain unanswered

### "training to improve the entire Egyptair service package"
Not Verified |  I travelled on holiday to Egypt with 3 family members the bad service started with our arrival at Cairo airport on Saturday morning 25 June 2022 as it took over an hour and a half for our luggage to arrive. Two weeks later we were booked to fly from Hurghada to Cairo on Friday 8 July 2022 our flight leaving at 8:40 pm, no announcements were made save for information displayed on the television in the departure lounge regarding the delay of all flights. As our connecting flight out of Cairo was scheduled for 2:20 am Saturday morning you can understand our stress. The local Egyptair representative also had no idea of the terms regarding the tri party alliance which exists as we found out that we could book our flight from Hurghada through Cairo onto Ethiopia and then to RSA. He did allow us to change our boarding passes and also changed the information on our luggage to be booked through to RSA. Once in the air we asked the steward to please announce once we arrive at Cairo to allow all passengers with connecting flights to be allowed to disembark first. Needless to say this didn't happen and on arrival a free for all ensued which meant this priority did not take place. When questioned the steward rudely snapped that her script didn't allow for our request to be made and justified her stance stating that she 'doesn't own the runway. Once on the bus a lady collapsed to the floor causing great concern amongst fellow passengers, logic would suggest the bus driver should get the patient to the terminal as quickly as possible to receive medical attention. However the driver obviously didn't see the urgency of the matter and rather chose to get out the bus and go and chat to his friend while chaos rained, he then got back into the bus and we thought he might now have realised the severity of the situation but then decided he hadn't finished his chat and got out again to carry on his conversation with his friend on the tarmac. The plane had landed at 01:05 am thanks to no other bus being available we were eventually dropped off at domestic arrivals 55 minutes later at 02:00am. The pressure to make our flight at 02:20 am was immense however I am relieved to say by mere minutes we made the flight to Ethiopia. No surprise that our luggage wasn't on the flight and it took a agent in RSA to trace and return our luggage. Our experience could be taken on board and used for training to improve the entire Egyptair service package. Given that the globe is trying to recover post Covid and the fact that tourism was probably the hardest hit airports and flying is the first impression tourists encounter.

### "have not received my luggage"
I'm so disappointed from your service, I had flight from Cairo to Benghazi through your company, last Wednesday, and I have not received my luggage until this moment! This happens to many passengers, and as I came to know this happens frequently. Very bad service.

### "no response from the airline"
Delayed/Lost Bags. Getting no response from the airline to several emails, on Messenger they just keep responding with "concerned team will assist shortly". this is now day 3. The Amman airport staff say call their office in Amman, no-one even picks calls there. They should respond and say something/anything!

### "I haven't received my refund yet"
Flight was cancelled 3 weeks before the flight, did an online refund as per their instructions. Claimed 21 days for the refund to be processed, it's been 45 working days now and I haven't received my refund yet. Egypt Air claimed 21 and they didn't honour their policy. I contacted them on Facebook and I'm still waiting.

### "missed my luggage in Cairo during transit"
I am a vegetarian and emailed them to arrange for veg meals on flights but nothing was done. I tried to call the call center in London and no one answered the call for 25 minutes. I requested the staff issue boarding pass, at the boarding gate and also the hostess inside bit all went on deaf ears. Though the hostess on the other aircraft (Cairo to Dubai) accommodated my request because she was willing to help not like her other counterparts. London to Cairo was delayed for more than 1 and a half hours and I had a transit flight from Cairo to Dubai. I told this to multiple hostesses on the flight and everyone assured me that it will be taken care of and someone will assist as soon as I land in Cairo. But no one helped. I was on my own running at the airport as only I was bothered that I should not miss my flight. This is the only airline I have seen who doesn't let families with kids go first inside the aircraft. Lastly, they missed my luggage in Cairo during transit. I didn't receive my luggage at the belt and was delivered 2nd day despite a promise of same-day delivery. Honestly, they were not bothered. I didnt get any help from anyone at any step. Even Dnata is not bothered. I will never recommend this airline to any traveler unless it is absolutely necessary.

### "Very basic service"
Not Verified |  Certainly not the best airline I have flown on. Very basic service and in flight catering consisted of a meat roll, and a cheese role, followed by a piece of chocolate cake. 3 flight attendants for a full 737, tells you level of service to be expected. For the price paid, I would have expected better, and as a Star Alliance carrier, even better.

### "worst airline I have experienced"
EgyptAir is the worst airline I have experienced. I had a flight from Luxor to Alexandria via Cairo. I showed the attendant my boarding passes while checking in my bags. He told me that the boarding passes were no longer relevant because the flight changed. Without any explanation of what actually changed. Then he gave me boarding passes to Cairo only, and marked my luggage to arrive in Cairo. I stopped him and tried to explain that I’m going to Alexandria. He corrected me and said that I’m mistaken. That my flight was only to Cairo. I explained that I have proof I have two legs on EgyptAir from Luxor to Cairo and then from Cairo to Luxor. He insisted that I was wrong, despite the ticket I presented. Then another attendant started searching for my ticket at the next counter over after seeing how frustrated I was. New information emerged. My flight from Cairo to Alexandria was apparently canceled and I had supposedly received an email. No email was received. The attendant then proceeded to explain that I needed to stop in Cairo, pick up my luggage and then file a complaint. No attempt to book me on an alternative flight was made or secure accommodations for me. I’ll be landing at night, around 9pm. I don’t live in Cairo, and don’t have a hotel reservation there. I asked to speak to a manager, and the first attendant, ridiculed me by saying he’s the manager and that there is nothing further to discuss. Just like those comedy shows where everyone is the manager. I picked up my boarding pass to Cairo and walked away. I felt humiliated. I felt disgusted by the staff at EgyptAir.

### "would like to thank the crew"
Not Verified |  I would like to thank the Flight MS-647 crew from Cairo to Riyadh for helping us, specially Mr Haytham for helping  during the trip.

### "upset at how your staff treated me"
I booked my flight to Germany via Cairo. I requested for wheel chair and it was booked with the ticket. Nairobi was fine. When I landed in Cairo it took time before I got someone to wheel me to the terminal for my next flight and he took me to the wrong terminal! When I asked him he said his shift is over and that's it! I was left stranded. I tried many times to get help from staffers but they seemed to ignore me. An hour or so later one reluctantly pushed me bit left me way before the actual terminal and told me to walk the rest of the way. I protested but he took off with his wheel chair. I then looked for those cars and hopped on to one. The guy refused to drive me until I told him I am not leaving his car. He then drove me there. As it that's not enough, when I was being wheel layer to the plane the man wheeling me insisted that I give him money. He spoke little English but he gesticulating violently saying I want money. I showed him 5 euros and he seems upset. He eventually calmed down when he saw 50 euros. My son wrote to you via email and they replied that they are sorry and will get back to him. Its been more than a week now and no communication. I am upset at how your staff treated me and how your customer care doesn't seem to care.

### "stranded in the airport for 24 hours"
I was left stranded in the airport for 24 hours without any care or concern, nor was any communication about the delay. It was truly a nightmare or the status of the plane, worse experience ever in the decades of my international travels. I was still waiting in the airport as I wrote this report. I will not recommend this airline to anyone especially for this particular route.

### "waiting for a few late passengers"
Flight 69 scheduled at 7:45 was delayed to 8:30 and then the connecting Flight #20 scheduled on 5/3 10:30 pm was delayed till 5/4 at 1:30 am. It is now 2:10 am and we have not begun the departure. They announced it was because they were waiting for a few late passengers. It is very unprofessional to force those who are on time to suffer because of other peoples irresponsibility.

### "the staff were untidy and looked unprofessional"
We travelled Vienna - Entebbe a group of 11 people with charity schedule all over Uganda. We travelled back with a short stay in Cairo. From Cairo-Entebbe the aircraft was dirty, the staff were untidy and looked unprofessional, no information given or any courtesy. When we returned to Entebbe the staff were rude telling us to sit down in the waiting area and not to walk around, we were treated like kindergarten kids. No information was given when the flight was delayed more than an hour, our tickets were checked multiple times - staff looked confused and did not know what they are doing. In Cairo we had to run to get our connection flight to Vienna then we were kept 2 hours in the aircraft with no explanation or information to be given. Once we arrived we waited more than 1h for our luggage when we realised they are lost. We had to spend another 2 hours to make a claim so we could received our luggage. Now I am left with no clothes, toiletries for 4 days until I fly to London. I will never use this airline ever again. This is the worst experience that I have ever had in my life.

### "Excellent service"
Not Verified |  We would like to thank the Airport crew and flight MS995 crew from Cairo to Toronto for helping us clear our vaccine issue. Many thanks. Excellent service

### "worst experience ever"
Cairo to Barcelona. Worst airline - after waiting for 3 hours was told that our flights was cancelled due to technical reasons. Which I understand, however staff are not helpful at all. We need to keep on asking about what’s gonna happen. We waited For nearly 4 hours before they make a plan. No communication between staff. Some staff rude and unapproachable. Really a bad experience. We booked for Turkish airlines but because of code sharing we end up with Egyptair and worst experience ever. We ended losing 1 day in Barcelona and our accommodation. Also they have inflight entertainment but you cannot used it as they don’t provide headsets.

### "I was impressed with the airline"
My flight was cancelled 4 days before departure; however, the customer service office in UAE did an absolute wonderful job of finding us 2 transfer flights. They were very friendly and attentive to the problem and figured out the difficult task of helping us depart Moscow during a time of limited flights. The main flight itself from Cairo to Washington (IAD) was comfortable and the cabin crew was friendly. The main dish was tasty and the included travel bag was a nice touch. In general the 12 hour flight was nice and arriving in Washington in the morning was pleasant. All together I was impressed with the airline for the way their customer service handled our problem and the flights themselves. I would only deduct that the snack meal provided could be with less bread.

### "definitely use them on this route again"
I was dreading using this airline but I was proved wrong. On the Cairo to London leg the aircraft was new and legroom far superior to BA. The entertainment system was good - I was impressed there was one. We were served a decent hot meal and soft drinks along with a snack and tea/coffee. The ticket price was the same as BA. I would definitely use them on this route again.

### "really had a bad experience"
I booked a round trip ticket from Munich to Addis Ababa for me and my daughter so that I can bring her back from Addis Ababa because the Egypt air website doesn't have the option to book for children aged 2-11 if they are not accompanied by an adult. And there is no one-way option just for her if I had bought a round trip ticket just for myself. With this option restriction being a mishap, on the return flight, I couldn't check in my daughter because they said she didn't fly together with me from Munich but she had already come with a one-way ticket prior to that. And because of this, I had to miss my flight since I can't leave without her and the agents at the airport check-in said I had to fix my ticket at a ticket office the next day. And because of this, missing the flight cost me additional expenses besides the extra flight expense that I had to pay which are the no-show penalty and getting a new ticket for my daughter. The website needs to have a section with details on the booking process on what's allowed and what's not. Because not knowing these limitations makes your customers suffer to such extreme levels be it mentally, financially, emotionally, and physically. Put a section where for certain types of bookings, it is best to do the booking at a ticket office. Because you are really inconveniencing your customers, I really had a bad experience with my 5-year-old daughter. In addition, during the flight, I was covered with a blanket and my daughter was watching a movie but the cabin crew passed my daughter without giving her lunch but gave one to the person in the next seat, and my daughter me why she didn't get one when I called the cabin staff and asked she told me it is because she thought I was sleeping. It doesn't matter if I was sleeping if my daughter is awake, she could have served the food to her or woke me up.

### "no news about my missing luggage"
I checked in my 6 bags in Ottawa on February 28th for a flight at 10AM and it was destined to arrive in Cairo with EgyptAir on March 1st at 9:45AM. I have an onward ticket from Cairo to Benghazi as well. When I arrived in Toronto for a 1 hour transit they informed me that the bags will be in transit all the way to Benghazi as Benghazi is my final destination. When I arrived in Benghazi 5 bags were there but the sixth one was not. Today is March 5th and there is still no news about my missing luggage. The 5 bags that arrived had a few items missing from them like new makeup/ wallet/ shoes.

### "Absolute awful experience"
Absolute awful experience, they cancelled my return flight in January 2022, and no offer of alternative unless I flew by March 2022. I had already booked with alternative airline so only option was to request a refund, did this on 15th December 2021 and have heard nothing since, tried to email in January asking for update, no response. Will never recommend Egyptair.

### "the most unpleasant flight"
I was on flight MS986 on Thursday, January 20, 2022 from NYC to Cairo. This was the most unpleasant flight I have ever taken. The flight crew was rude and condescending, and did not enforce any air travel rules, including the wearing of masks by travelers. It was quite unbelievable how little regard the crew had for the travelers; they were impolite and generally unavailable to help/serve the passengers. At one point during the flight, I found the crew in the rear cabin of the plane joking around and ignoring requests of the passengers. The rest rooms were filthy, and about 2 hours into this 10 hour flight, there was no toilet paper or hand wash in the restrooms. The temperature in our cabin was about 75 degrees and several passengers, including myself, requested that some cool air be put on in the cabin. The first time this was requested, the temperature cooled for about 45 minutes, after that our requests were ignored, and the cabin was at uncomfortably hot temperatures for the remainder of the flight. Fortunately my flight back to the US on Egyptair on February 7th was a pleasant one, so I do not completely denounce Egyptair, but feel the crew on that flight I took be reprimanded for the horrible service provided on that long, overnight flight to Cairo.

### "gave me another flight after 4 hours"
Not professional airline. I will never fly by it, they canceled my flight without any notice in email or the phone. They gave me another flight after 4 hours and no one gave meal or drink. I asked that to the staff and they refused my request.

### "Limited seat reclining"
Easy online booking. Cheaper than competitors. Swift check in. Acceptable lounge service. Aircraft seems very old. Limited seat reclining. Very small screen. Limited entertainment channels. Audio system is very bad. Meals was OK but not tasty. No choices of juices. Foot rest is very primitive and far from seat. Toilet amenities are poor. Staff tries to help.

### "very disappointed"
My review is about the food and beverage, and service. Very bad quality food and we were given juices for Juniors like kids. The crew disappeared after serving food and not presenting themselves but at food time. My family chose Egypt Air for convenience and it being a direct flight to Cairo but unfortunately all were very disappointed.

### "couldn’t find the payment for the extra luggage"
My flight was in the early morning from Addis Ababa to Copenhagen. I went to the airport 2hrs prior to my flight as the airport is not busy at all. I bought an extra luggage through the travel agency I booked my ticket, however when I was trying to check in, I was told they couldn’t find the payment for the extra luggage I added in their system, though I showed them the confirmation email I got from the travel agency. But still I was asked to pay for the extra luggage, otherwise I won’t check in. So I was like okay it’s fine, I will ask for a refund when I go back to Copenhagen. So the total amount was almost 300 dollars, and I took my credit card from my pocket and I was told they don’t accept credit card, but only cash. I was like how am I supposed to have that amount of money in cash when I’m leaving the country I had been staying for 3 months. There were no ATM around so I couldn’t check in and missed my flight, tho I had money in my credit card. That made me book another flight with Ethiopian Airlines and I payed for the extra luggage by credit card . I was so disappointed, but I also learned my lesson on the hard way that to never ever fly with Egypt Air.

### "crew served a nice snack box"
Fantastic. A short flight of an hour and the crew served a nice snack box with juice and water (Egyptair is a dry airline, no alcohol). No lounge in Sharm El Sheikh. The lounge in Cairo was well stocked with individually packaged food items (eg. sandwiches, deserts, fruits, etc). The ground experience could use a little more attention with regard to priority boarding for business class.

### "Terrible experience"
An absolutely disgusting airline! I booked a flight with them and they cancelled it for absolutely no reason at all. They emailed me that it was cancelled and that I could reschedule my flight using their customer support service or a nearby Egyptair office. The customer support service never answered and left me hanging for so long that my call credits ran out and there is no Egyptair office close to where I live. Terrible experience and a terrible company.

### "just waiting like everyone else"
The most useless business class I have seen on the regional routes. Gold track doesn't work at all in the airport, seats are the same (not even like in euro business class when the one in the middle is not occupied), I had to queue four lines on my way to the plane, and not even once I could skip any of it, I was just waiting like everyone else. No welcome drinks on the board, poor lounge in the Cairo Domestic terminal.

### "told that my tickets been cancelled"
I booked with Egypt air through their own website on the 1st of May my business tickets for me and my family, total of 4 business tickets, one way route from Johannesburg to Dubai. On the 6th of May, only 24 hours before departure, I received email from Egypt air cancelling all my tickets. I called the Head office in Johannesburg where they told me that flight is still on, but my tickets is been cancelled without them knowing whats going on. I called the head office where I was told that my tickets been cancelled because its coming from South Africa and we are not allowed into Dubai. But I told them that I'm Emirati citizen and its stating in Egyptair website that Emirati are excluded and we can enter UAE without any problems. They agreed on that and told me my business tickets were taken by someone else and only economy seats are available for the 7th May. Or I can reschedule my flight for the 14th after Eid. I told them that I booked and fully paid my 4 business tickets for the 7th as its even more expensive than the 14th because of Eid season and I would like my business tickets back as I didn't cancel or request cancelling and I still wants my tickets. Long story short, I wasn't given my business tickets and I had to fly economy class despite paying full amount a week before for business seats. This was my first booking with Egyptair and I'm totally disappointed on how this turned out.

### "As of today the situation is still not resolved"
Not Verified |  On March 30, 2021, I arrived at Washington Dulles airport to catch flight MS932 to Cairo Egypt. When I arrived I observed a chaotic situation without any social distancing and barely any resemblance to crowd control or customer service. There were many passengers that did not have their Covid-19 negative verification certificate printed out. Because we are in the digital age I can understand why passengers would assume that they would be able to just show an agent digital results on a mobile device. The agents were requiring passengers with their results on digital devices to print them there at the counter, Egyptair had a single laptop with a malfunctioning printer at a counter that all of the passengers had to share. Again, there was not any social distancing, no hand sanitizer, no assistance for passengers who were not computer literate and the male ticket agents had extremely bad attitudes. This created a situation of chaos. As a result of all of the chaos, some passengers missed the closing of the boarding gate including myself. I was told that I would not be able to board the flight and I was offered to have the flight rebooked for free. The gentleman at the counter told me that I would not have to pay a change fee. When I got to the counter to arrange for a new flight the attendant who was making arrangements for other passengers was charging what he called an upgrade fee. I watched him as he did this to three different passengers, with each of the fees being different for each passenger sitting in the same section. It was now my turn. He told me that I had to pay a fee. I asked, "What is the fee for". He said that it was upgrading the service. I then asked him what are the upgrades and what do I get. He looked surprised that I asked that question and had no explanation for it. I then asked him will I be getting something extra and will I be able to pick my seat as I did on my original booking. He said no. He seemed to be angry and told me if I did not want to do that then I should call customer service in New York. I left the airport and called New York customer service and I was on the phone stuck on hold for approximately two hours before I was disconnected by their telephone system. I had no better luck with their customer service. Today March 31, 2021, I once again tried to contact the ticket agent and customer service by phone with the exact same results. I now have a return flight two weeks from now which I will not be in Cairo to fly on. This has been the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I am so grateful that this was not an emergency travel situation. As of today the situation is still not resolved.

### "I'm disappointed, I will never use their service again"
Not Verified |  This is the worst experience ever! I bought my tickets, and the day before my flight I got a covid positive test. What should I do? I had to apply for a refund. Later they said I can rebook my tickets, I agreed to that, but in 2 weeks I got a refund 95$ out of 250$!It's less than 50%! Seriously? Are Egyptair trying to take advantage of this whole covid situation? It's unpredictable, I didn't cancel it with my will, I had shown them my results even, they just said sorry, we can't refund more! I'm disappointed, I will never use their service again, and wouldn't recommend anyone!

### "Absolute disaster"
Not Verified |  Absolute disaster. I have never seen the kind of chaos at boarding for MS777 to London than I saw today. I am genuinely concerned. This is a nightmare. Good luck to anyone flying this route.

### "Egyptair was not helpful at all"
My flight from CMN to CAI (2.15 pm on 01/08) was delayed by 5 hours. The connecting flight from CAI to ADD on 01/09 was cancelled. It took them 4 hours to give us proper information. They told me they would put me on the CAI to ADD flight the next day (24 hours later). 45 min. before departure the Egyptair transit desk told me that I could not board because my Covid-PCR test had expired. 30 min. before departure they realized that it was a mistake, because they had confused the day of the test with the day of my birthday. By that time, the boarding of the flight had closed. It took another 6 hours for Egyptair to figure out where I could do a new test. I got a special permission to do it within the terminal and had to pay EUR 90. I never received a receipt for this test although I asked several times. By that time, I had spent 34 hours in the transit terminal, without proper information, without accommodation, without communication (there is only 30 min. free internet). It was very cold and they did not even give us a blanket. On 01/10 at 12.30 pm I was put up in an airport hotel. I was rebooked on a flight CAI–NBO–BJM 2 days later. I left CAI on 01/12 9.30 pm and arrived in BJM on 01/13 10 am. The scheduled arrival was 01/09 1 pm, 4 days earlier. Of course, my luggage did not show up and I put in a claim. It finally arrived in BJM on 01/21, with a delay of another 8 days. Egyptair (in the transit terminal in CAI) was not helpful at all. The staff was extremely rude, impolite and incompetent. They took our passport “to process the new tickets”, they let little children sleep on the floor without even a blanket, and no warm meal in nearly 35 hours, not able to communicate with anyone with only 30 min. free Wifi. No one listened to us and no one ever apologized. Of course no refund for anything was given. You cannot reach anyone by phone and e-mails are being left unanswered. A disgrace for the airline industry.

### "refused to upgrade our seats"
We were disappointed with the customer relations and handling of problems with our flight. The plane was clean and comfortable, and we received waters and hand sanitizer upon boarding. However, our flight to Cairo from Luxor was canceled two days before the flight while we were already on our trip. In the case of our traveling companions, they never received confirmation of their cancelation (different flight a day later, but same story). The new flight they put us on would not work with our itinerary, but after trying to get in touch with them at short notice, none of their numbers worked. We finally found a number that worked, but they were unable to help us much. They finally put us on an earlier flight the day before, causing us to lose an entire day of our vacation, but would not compensate us for a lost day of our itinerary. After asking, they refused to upgrade our seats. They also would not let us check in online, and so after arriving at the airport, we found out the new flight they put us on is not even a direct flight and was a multi-stop flight back to Cairo. Now we must find a hotel or place to stay in Cairo for the night since we are getting in 25 hours earlier than our itinerary. While this is obviously not the company’s fault, this demonstrates a lack of hospitality and willingness to help make a bad situation easier on us due to their cancelations. This also shows that multiple people over multiple days were unwilling to help us in any way.

### "a rather good experience"
Travelling during the covid-19 times. Check-in on the counter was pretty smooth - cannot say the same for the app. First leg was pretty full - anout 80-85%, we left Entebbe with a slight delay. Was lucky that I was in a window seat with nobody next to me, so the flight was pretty comfortable. The food was ok - water, juice, 2 small baguettes (1 cheese + 1 chicken) & chocolate cake. Prepacked and really quick to hand out. It is known that they are non-alcohol, but they also did not offer coffee or tea. Cabin crew did the service quickly (food, covid measures and immigration info) and then came out again before landing. The transit time was pretty tight (1 hour) and with a short delay I doubted I would catch the next flight. Cairo airport is not that big, but finding your way when hurried can be hard. After going to the transfer desk I was rushed to my next flight which had almost boarded. With the assistance of the ground crew me and another fellow passenger made it. The 2nd leg was about 25% full. Identical service. They offer a pack in every flight, which contains alcohol gel, alcohol wipes, 2 masks, and gloves. Landing was smooth, however my luggage did not find it's way to the 2nd flight and it remained in Cairo. Did a declaration and it was delivered to my door after 2 days. All in all a rather good experience - there were problems, but the company managed to assist overcoming them.

### "inflight service provided was less than acceptable"
I feel obliged to write a review about the Business Class facility on Egyptair. I am totally disappointed with the type of service provided especially when I paid a lot of money to travel Business Class! My comments - 1) The boarding facility at Abu Dhabi airport was total confusion! As a Business Class traveller I had to go to the boarding counter and ask to be boarded. 2) The inflight service provided from Abu Dhabi to Cairo was less than acceptable especially the food provided and no follow ups. Every time I asked for something I was looked at as if I had annoyed the crew! 3) The inflight service provided from Cairo to Abu Dhabi was no different from the above. I had to ask 3 times for a blanket and pillow! And the food!! Well.... I would get better food at McDonalds! No coffee or tea offered, just a bottle of water and an option between orange juice or water! I am totally disappointed with Egyptair and would strongly recommend anyone wanting to travel to Cairo to fly with another carrier especially when you pay extra for business class service and you don't get it.

### "the plane was not clean at all"
Flight attendants are not prepared at all in managing and organizing the flight and the passengers. I had a problem in sitting in my seat and they handled the situation in a very unprofessional way. I had the feeling that they wouldn't care if I travel standing in the aisle and not sitting during the 10 hour flight and I’m not over reacting! The flight attendant refused to give me his name then after I insisted he gave me his name and dared me to file a complaint against him! They treat Egyptian nationalities really badly. Moreover the plane was not clean at all especially during the COVID pandemic which is not acceptable. You find used napkins in between the seats from previous flights! That’s not all, they lost my 2 pieces of luggage in New York and they are still searching for it.

### "I refused to take down the bassinet"
I asked when checking in if a bassinet would be available for my son and was told that it would. On both legs of our flight we were not placed close to the bassinet seats and were told, 'that's just the way it is'. We had to fight to get the seats by asking other passengers to swap with us or refusing to sit down until we were moved. On the Cairo-Heathrow leg of our journey two other passengers tried to stop airline staff from installing the bassinet and then insisted I stand up and move seats before it could be installed, thus waking my son. They then asked me to carry him for the last two hours of the flight as they were uncomfortable. As a single parent I also needed a space to place my son safely whilst packing my bag or performing other tasks. When I refused to take down the bassinet the passengers were unpleasant and I became very upset. The captain of the flight took their side against mine and told me that, 'there is no problem, the only problem is that you are shouting'. I was left very angry and upset and received no apology. I will not be flying with Egypt air again under any circumstances.

### "still have not received my refund"
I bought a ticket Madrid to Cairo. I requested a refund due to not being able to travel in March 2020. My ticket allowed a refund with a small penalty. 9 months have passed and I still have not received my refund. I have written many times to Customer Service. But they just say they will forward the problem to another department. I have called the assistance phone number, but they only put a recording in Arabic.

### "refused multiple times to be checked in online"
Entered Cairo airport with efficient time to board flight. Was refused multiple times to be checked in online to receive electronic boarding pass. Since Cairo airport does not allow you to be cleared I couldn’t pass to the flight desk to receive boarding pass and check my bag. By time someone who understood English was able to understand me it was 11:24pm which they pointed me to business alliance. Once, they sent me to business alliance the guy who did not have on a mask stated what you want me to do!! Then by the time he decided to call after I was expressing the issues I have endured they informed him the gate was closed at 11:30pm. He stated he nothing he can do and shrugged his shoulders then said you can go to customer service. Walked over to customer service where a guy on his cell phone pointed me to the other windows who Pointed me back to the Egypt air customer service window. Eventually the guy got up and left since he wasn’t suppose to be there. The other guys said they don’t speak English and laughed in our Faces. I have never been to an airport and airline which just refuse to provide any assistance. Plane was not departing until 12:01am

### "airline misplaced my baggage"
Despite the generally bad reviews of Egyptair I decided to give it a try as the prices were low, but regretted my decision. The tray table had not been cleaned, seat was malfunctioning, armrest rusted. No entertainment on international flight. To cap it all the airline misplaced my baggage, and I got my baggage a week later on my 2 week vacation. I had to purchase all neccesities on my own money and when contacted Egypt air for even a partial refund, they led me on a long process which eventually led to nowhere. In the end they stopped responding to my emails altogether. Rather pay a little more and get good service instead of being deceived by cheap air fares from Egyptair.

### "Cancelled my booking"
Cancelled my booking without letting me know. I found out by accident while looking at my bookings to see if i could get an extra bag. I tried to phone their call center in Germany but the numbers dont work. I tried to email their customer support and i haven't recieved a reply. My mum had to phone them from Cairo. They told her they couldnt confirm whether the rescheduled flight would also be cancelled and that we are only allowed to re-schedule one time or we would have to pay for another flight. They cancelled the flight, then said if they cancelled again we would have to pay.

### "challenging to get adequate information"
I was booked to fly from London to Douala via Cairo and EgyptAir did an excellent job to contact me fours days before my flight to inform me the flight was cancelled. I was directed to get to the ticketing agent to initiate a process to get a refund. It was been challenging to get adequate information from the agent that issued the ticket to me. I have made several attempts to to know the next steps to get this sorted out without success. I need to get a refund.

### "exceeded all of my expectations"
Cairo to New York. I had hesitated booking Egyptair because of many poor reviews of business class on routes. There were not any business class reviews for the non-stop Cairo to JFK. Much to my surprise the flight exceeded all of my expectations. The special ground check in took just a few minutes and the ground agent was courteous. Boarding was well organized and I was directed to my seat. There is no first class so this was a business class cabin. The plane felt new. The seat pods are spacious with plenty of storage space. There were blankets and pillows. There is a storage space with water as well as a storage space for headphone. They provide a nice amenity kit with a brush. The entertainment screen is large. There is an extensive selection of new releases as well as older movies. The entertainment system worked flawlessly. The flight attendants were very attentive. They check frequently to make sure my beverage was always full and asked if I have any special requests. The menu offered a nice selection of choices. The servings were plentiful although the quality was not up to the same level as my experience on other airlines in business class. And they brought all the servings on one tray although they did serve hot food separately. All in all, a very nice experience.

### "would never recommend Egyptair"
Cairo to London. At Mansoura Egyptair Office I paid more than 10000 egyptian pounds to change the date of my and my wife’s tickets since the imminent suspension of airports because of Corona virus. Despite saying that changing travel dates is free, the staff were playing games,  and bargaining with customers to charge the largest amount if money. Initially they denied any economy seats left and asked for 23000 eg pounds per seat i.e. 46000 for 2 seats business class for only to change the travel date. When I complained to the manager I found out that there are many economy seats and asked to pay over 10000 per ticket i.e. over 20000. After arguing this was reduced to 10056 Egyptian pounds which I had no choice but to pay. This is illegal since the closure of the airports was the government decision and not a mind change. This is giving the company and the country bad name. I come across tens of angry passengers who would never recommend Egyptair to anyone. This is sad situation at a time other companies are helping their passengers.

### "They cancelled my booking"
They cancelled my booking from Nairobi to Cairo. Hours before my scheduled flight, I received an e-mail stating that my booking was confirmed but needed to check-in in the airport, once I tried to check-in the airport I was informed that my booking was cancelled and cannot board the plane. All Information they gave me, is to go to Egyptair’s website and contact them, the website has 100’s of numbers that do not answer. After 5 hour of trying different phone numbers, the number that worked was the UAE number. Important to say, that in the 10 hours that I was in the Nairobi airport trying to sort out my flight, the Egyptair office in the airport never opened and the Nairobi office in the city is closed on weekends. Worst customer service if something goes wrong with your flight.

### "Good in flight service"
Dubai to Cairo. Long queue at boarding desk but checking was smooth,they had allotted our seat a day before journey and send the web boarding on mail, they had given us aisle and next to aisle. The aircraft seating configuration was 2-4-2, we wanted to change to window but as no window were available for 2 to seat together. But when we boarded found that no one was seating beside us means we 2 share 4 seats, that was comfortable. Flight departed and and arrived on time, aircraft was clean good leg room, breakfast was good, we selected for special (hindu) meal and it was provided. No alcoholic beverage on Egyptair. Good in flight service. Overall good experience and can fly again.

### "Overall decent experience"
Flown last month between Cairo and Dubai,we arrived Airport around 3 and half hour before departure and check in was smooth,no queue at all. They mailed boarding with seat allotment a day before journey and it was window and middle seat for 2 of us so good. The flight departed half hour late but reach Dubai nearly on time. Though they have A330 on this route but on the day of our journey it was narrow body Boeing 737 so certainly leg room was less, but as it was just 3 hr flight so ok. Aircraft was clean and tidy, we had dinner at airport lounge so didn't had meals, only non alcoholic beverages are available on Egyptair. IFE was ok, surprised to see 3-4 hindi movies too. Overall decent experience.

### "airline should improve"
Guangzhou to Cairo. It was a long haul flight with full of tourist groups, the aircraft and facility were very old. 2 out of 3 PTV touch screens in my row didn't work well and you had to use the remote controller. Some cabin crew served drinks and food with one hand in the pocket and didn't look professional. There was only one choice of snacks between the meals: cheese sandwich. I think the airline should improve its facility a lot.

### "Overall a pleasant flight"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Cairo. I can honestly say my wife and I were pleasantly surprised at our flight experience. Staff were very good and attentive. Food was good - too much in fact. Aircraft in excellent condition and nice and clean. Overall a pleasant flight and would recommend Egyptair based on our experience .

### "no-frills low cost"
EgyptAir Business Class MS768 Barcelona to Cairo was bad. The seat was old and uncomfortable, it barely reclined and the footrest did not work. The entertainment system on my chair didn’t work. I had to change seats and even then, the sound had a hissing buzz and the screen so small that it was impossible to read or enjoy a movie. I asked for a seafood meal and I received a salad with four pieces of lettuce, two pieces of bread, fish and some fruits. Overall the meal was disappointing, but the fish fresher than normal on the same flight. The cost of the ticket is disproportionately steep because of the monopoly that the company has on the route. Given the vintage condition of the carrier, it should be priced as a no-frills low cost

### "improved by leaps and bounds"
Athens to Johannesburg via Cairo. When flying with Egyptair one has to be aware that no alcohol is served on board. This can be a damper for some. It wasn't a major inconvenience for me. Its fleet is dated and their entertainment system is not up to date with the latest movies. However they have improved by leaps and bounds. The Manager at the Athens Airport was very helpful and accommodating. On board flight attendants were polite, friendly and helpful on all my sectors. In flight meals have improved tremendously and my starter entrée from Cairo onwards definitely could compete with the likes of Emirates. A very pleasant relaxing trip. Price wise cheaper than their competitors. Yes I will most definitely fly them again.

### "Hotel is not included"
Toronto to Dubai via Cairo and they say you have to stay 16 hr in the airport or pay to upgrade your ticket and leave at 9 am. Hotel accommodation is not included in the ticket I bought. Then I paid and got to the hotel on my own because there was no shuttle available yet. At the hotel was another surprise and no room available got to wait till a guest leave.

### "my bag was left behind"
Dubai to Aswan via Cairo. I got an email on the day before about 12h prior my departing time to tell me the flight had been cancelled so my flight was postponed by 1 hour. Check in & baggage drop in Dubai was alright. When we arrived in Aswan my bag (1 out of 4) was left behind, we were told it happened because of little time (we had 4h connection). I was given 2 options: either I needed to come back about 23:30 - midnight, the time for next flight scheduled, so I could open my bag for them to check, however I would get no compensation, not even to cover taxi expenses. Or I provided the code so they could open by themselves and had it delivered at the hotel. As I had nothing of high value in my suitcase I opted for giving them the code. I finally got my bag around 2am, checked all the content and nothing removed but for my surprise they've changed the code and I'm now unable to lock it again.

### "poor English language"
Cairo to Dubai. Very disorganized and misleading information about check in desks. The staff I dealt with have poor English language skills. The good side is a new aircraft.

### "offer real Business seating"
Athens to Cairo. Flight departed on time, on Boeing 737-800. Cabin was clean and the seat was very comfortable. There were IFE monitors but there was no entertainment playing, only music channels. Food was good and refreshments great. If they offer alcohol would worth Business class. Even though they are the only one on the route that offer real Business seating than Euro business.

### "very unsatisfied customer"
This airline does not operate 24hrs service. The customer service number is never reachable, when it rings nobody picks up. The customer service at the Cairo Airport is the poorest I have experienced. The washrooms at the Cairo Airport is worse that public washrooms in most African countries. I am a very unsatisfied customer.

### "Really bad experience"
Really bad experience with Egyptair. Unfortunately we took a multi-city flight and both of them were not very pleasant. Staff are rude. First flight I was asked if I was using my pillow, so I said I will use it as it was a 5 hour flight, the air hostess took it from me and never came back with one. Second flight I saw how one of the air hostess was shouting several times and at different people to move from the corridor. Very rude and aggressive behaviour, just shocking. I was asked if I wanted chicken or beef but I was force to take beef because there wasn't more chicken. Flight back was almost the same, rude staff, missing food twice (Bangkok-Cairo-Madrid) I was asked: beef or chicken. I said chicken and I was told that my food was coming. After 10 minutes when everyone else was served, me and the lady next to me asked where was our food. They had forgotten and again was forced to take beef because they sold out all the chicken. Dreadful customer service, I won't ever fly again with Egyptair.

### "luggage did not arrive"
New York to Nairobi via Cairo. We called multiple times and spent more than ten hours on hold, plus sent multiple emails into the void, trying to get a refund for my sister’s supposedly refundable ticket. We talked to the customer service agent at JFK, who referred us back to the web site and email — so we shouted again into the void. Weeks have passed. Still nothing. Then my priority tagged luggage did not arrive and I filed a lost luggage report. The web “tracker” still says check back later, and my address and luggage information are incorrect. I emailed their lost luggage department days ago but have received no response.

### "Egyptair is having a come back"
Dubai to Cairo return both flights left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Outbound was A330 an older plane which looks a bit tired on return was a brand new Boeing 787 with new leather seats and big 12 inch screens it’s a fantastic aircraft was so quiet during take off and landing which was very smooth crew were friendly and helpful but Egyptairneeds to look into the grooming standards of its employees as well as they need to change this uniform which in my opinion doesn’t reflect the legacy of the airline or the country . Food was ok, the entertainment IFE is with limited options not so many selections, however on the Boeing 787 they have live TV of Euronews and sky news I think Egyptair is having a come back and reviving itself well done MS

### "Disappointing quality of service"
Abu Dhabi to Casablanca via Cairo. Flight was late leaving AUH by an hour for no apparent reason. The new A220 does not have business class seats so regardless of me having a paid business class ticket the seat was the same as the economy section. The late departure from AUH meant my bag missed the connection in Cairo. I had to return to Casablanca airpor At my own expense the next day to collect. Disappointing quality of service with no concern for passengers.

### "not worth the price they charge"
Aswan to Cairo on a 3-month old Airbus A220-300 with Egyptair. Seats are hard and there was no IFE of any kind. No alcohol at all served on board. Cabin crew well-groomed and quite friendly. No announcements from the cockpit. Cookies and one round of drinks served during this 75 minutes flight. Departed and landed behind schedule. Wi-Fi available but did not work during the entire flight. Overall, an OK experience but not worth the price they charge for this route.

### "improved a lot since last year"
Bangkok to London via Cairo. Check in at Bangkok was quick with no queues in all classes. The new Thai lounge was right across from our gate, and is a big improvement from most of their lounges. The lounge is huge. Boarding was disorganised, with door A for economy and door B for business when normally it is the other way around, leading to confusion. There were also Egyptian security agents checking details at the gate in Bangkok. I received a warm welcome on both flights and found my seat. Bangkok flights really should get an aircraft upgrade. The A330 is not suitable for this route. The seats in business and economy are only mid-haul quality, but the flight is 10 hours long which makes it a long-haul flight. The seat on the 777 is much better. They’re both angle-flat seats, but the 777 has more pitch, which means your legs aren’t shoved into some tiny compartment under the seat in front. On the A330 this at least has the slight benefit of having the TV screen closer to you, unfortunately the headphone jack was not working. I didn’t mind as I caught some much-needed sleep. Entertainment was rather spoilt for choice but I don’t like the lack of action movies. The amenity kit given on both flights were an improvement from last year, with Aigner lotions and potions as well as some nicer amenities. Food wise; I had ordered a gluten free meal but the flight attendants came around with normal meals and asked if I would prefer to have those instead. All the food was really good but their starter should be more creative, the only appetiser choice was smoked salmon and prawns on all flights. Cairo has a large number of transit passengers, and you clear security at the gate before boarding which makes it a very easy transfer. The newer lounge called Alioth which recently opened is very preferable to the older lounges, namely Almesian. My seatmate used the latter and he described it as a crowded mess. My lounge experience was pretty good but nowhere near the best. My favourite bit about flying Egyptair is that their arrival time into Heathrow is the least busy time of the day, at 1pm, and immigration was deserted. I had a pretty good experience with Egyptair and they have improved a lot since last year and I have easily taken notice. I might consider taking them again in the future if they upgrade the equipment on the Bangkok route.

### "no information on my luggage"
Not Verified |  In August 2019, Accra to Tokyo with a transit in Cairo only to arrive in Narita Tokyo with no luggage. I filed my missing luggage as soon as possible and received a mail indicating it will be worked on. That was the last I heard from the airline, I followed up with calls in Tokyo by myself and the concierge but never any response. There were hardly any attendants to even pick the call. I returned to Ghana still with no luggage or a credible response. I go to their office in Accra regularly only to be met with Empty desks. Their manager is barely in office and I still have no information on my luggage. It’s been almost 4 months now with no update or compensation. To think I was a business class ticket holder and experienced this mismanagement is appalling. I will never use this airline or recommend this airline to anyone. Very rude attendants in Cairo when I asked to follow up on the luggage during my transit.

### "below my expectations"
Hong Kong to Bangkok. Being star alliance gold member of Singapore airlines, I looked forward to trying Egyptair for the very first time, and see what they have to offer. However, my business class experience was way below my expectations. Crew's grooming were not really neat, there was no sense of welcome throughout the flight. They were chatting away in the galley, ignoring passengers most of the time. Crew did the bare minimum, there was no smile, they weren't engaging or pro active, from the pursers to junior crew. Since no menu was provided, crew didn't explain what's available in terms of beverages. I had to ask, and it was apparent that they weren't interested to inform me what's available, I felt every little request I made was a huge bother to them. Came meal time, all 3 choices were brought in front of me (instead of using a cart), I had to make a quick decision. I was asked to take the chosen meal from the tray she held. (it's a hot plate btw). No after dinner coffee or tea was offered. Dessert was offered on one sector but not the other.. Crew didn't check for safety procedures during landing and take off on one flight, there were a few passengers still asleep with window shut and flatbed position. This really bothered me and raised all the red flags for safety concerns. There was hardly any announcement from the cockpit about the flight, and info of arrival destination. Toilet was not kept clean. Smoking in the toilet by one of the crew. The business class ticket price was very cheap though. Still, cheap does not mean it has to be bad at this level. I fail to comprehend how they can be one of Star alliance's members?

### "shabby by international standards"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Athens via Cairo. I got a very good deal on this flight. Trying to contact them in North America to make flight changes is a mystery. The web site directs you to a Montreal phone number which is no longer in use. I contacted the New York office and a woman tried to help me but ended up giving me the wrong seats although I had paid extra for them. I tried contacting a Toronto office and was on hold for 90 minutes and never ended up talking with anyone. I contacted the New York office and a gentleman did contact me and tried to help but once again gave me the wrong seats and charged me for them and then disappeared. After this experience we approached the flight with some trepidation and most of it unfortunately was warranted. Flight was on time, food was mediocre, service was okay. The Egyptair portion of Cairo airport is more like a bus terminal than an international airport, fast food outlets and hard plastic seats. The lounge is probably the worst I’ve ever seen. You can get a drink but be prepared to pay over $20.00 for a simple vodka mixed drink. Boarding is more like a stampede than an orderly assignment of seats. The attendants were friendly enough but I didn’t get the sense there was any motivation to provide better customer service. Planes were shabby by international standards.

### "dog was 4 kg above the limit"
On October 27th, I was boarding EgyptAir plane MS0895. I had my dog with me. It took me long time to get a permit from US authorities to allow my dog to enter US. The manager talked to me in a very rude way saying don’t waste my time. This dog won’t go on the plane. He was 4 kg above the limit. I offered to pay extra fees. He refused firmly and ordered me out of the line till I take the dog away. He ordered me to take him to Cargo. I called an Egyptian friend and left my dog with her, and I had to board the plane. My friend went to Egyptair Cargo: they told her that they don’t take live animals because they had several accidents. She took my dog to her place and went to return his ticket. EgyptAir took 10% of the ticket. My pet is left in Egypt now. . How can I get my pet to travel to US now?

### "very poor service"
Amsterdam to Bangkok via Cairo. I've flown a couple of times with this airline - bought a couple of tickets all at once because they were very reasonably priced. In all honesty: I so much regret doing this. On short-haul flights Egyptair has terrible seats in BC; these are very hard and I need to put a blanket under me to sit on. The long haul flights - done A330 and B777 - have seats that not go entirely flat and when sleeping on your side as I do, it messes up your spine. Overall: the planes are just like the lounge in Cairo dirty. Usually, I use the wet tissues to wipe my armrests and they turn black. Also when in the bathroom of the plane, the shelves are black of all sorts of dirty stuff. Staff usually want to do their best, but it all is very clear that they seem to be totally unexperienced or just not a 100% fit for their job. This already starts with small things where I get extremely annoyed with everyone sleeping during the flight and then when sitting at row 4 I still clearly hear staff having their "tea party" conversations and laughs. It would be nice that like in other airlines you would have some sense of your paying customers wanting to have a sleep. Food on board seems to have quite a variety - on the short-haul flights it is always terrible while on long haul it seems to be OK-ish, but also not more than that. Have had much better on other airlines. As for the lounge: it is just all dirty and the food is very mediocre. Most of the stuff I don't want to touch. Reasonably priced tickets but still expensive because you get very poor service and a poor BC product for it.

### "Professional staff"
Not Verified |  Hurghada to Manchester. After travelling home on Egyptair following the collapse of Thomas cook I have to admit I was a little apprehensive. I shouldn't have been, a smooth flight and hot meal provided. Professional staff, big thank you for getting us all home safely.

### "lack of customer service"
New York to Cairo. Concerned with the lack of customer service on my last flight September 28th from Cairo. My partner and I were extremely disappointed. Not only was the flight long and uncomfortable, but rude flight attendants  made it more horrific. They were not nice when I asked for a cup of water and told me to wait and I waited almost forty minutes until they came back to me to do so. I understand that the flight attendants may be tired and maybe the personality or aggression that is given to one another in Egypt is normal but not to me. We have respect and kindness to one another and to the ones around us.

### "lost my luggage for a month"
Not Verified |  Athens to Ghana via Cairo with Egyptair. Awful airline. They lost my luggage for a month. I have not even received my bags before I left. What made it worst is that they had no customer service, no agents present. You were just expected to wait for the bags. Would not recommend this airline.

### "broke both my wife and my bags"
Cairo to Sharm El Sheikh in March 2018. Flight was normal. Nothing special. Egyptair don't care about the customers and refuse to reply or help. They broke both my wife and my bags. We did the paperwork at the airport in Cairo as was directed. Only to find out they won't pay for 2 bags on one form. For 18 mths they just ignore the facts and offer to pay for 1 bag.

### "food is very bad"
Toronto to Istanbul via Cairo. The food is very bad, and the flight crew were rude to me. When I went to ask for a glass of water since they only give beverages twice during the 12 hour flight, the air hostess was aggressive and started making stupid gestures . Also Egyptair staff at the transit office in Cairo airport are disrespectful when we approached them to talk about our seats.

### "Good value for money"
Washington to Cairo with Egyptair. Good value for money, great flight times, friendly staff. Business class on the Dreamliner is great/modern and able to compete with larger airlines. Comfortable seats and nice selection in entertainment system Drinks section is a bit limited (and no alcohol) and the lounge in CAI is not the best.

### "still waiting for reimbursement"
Asmara to Milan via Cairo. In the december 2018 I flew from Cairo to Milan and because of fog we had to land in Roma Fiumicino. Obviously I had to pay by myself for reaching my final destination and after 7 months I'm still waiting for the reimbursement, no answers from the company yet.

### "very professional and friendly"
New York to Cairo. The crew were very professional and friendly, wish to fly with such crew every time. I fly a lot on other airlines such as Delta and Lufthansa, never gave a review cause we’re normal but this flight was different.

### "miss our connecting flight"
Not Verified |  Hurghada to Cairo. Egyptair was the worse flying experience we have had. They are equivalent to Spirit airlines in the US. Every flight in the terminal for them was delayed or cancelled. Our flight was delayed by more than 11 hours causing us to miss our connecting flight. When rebooking our connection the EgyptAir manager ensured us that our flight would be at 10pm and we paid our rebook fee of $250 per person (different airline). Lo and behold, the 10pm flight did not depart until 12:45am causing us to miss our connection. The response we received from Egyptair was that it is not their responsibility for another airline. We ended up losing 2 days of our next leg of travel and costing us over $1500. We were treated so poorly, airline personnel gave us attitude.

### "altogether a good experience"
Kuwait to New York via Cairo. I recently flew the EgyptAir route from Kuwait to JFK through Cairo and it was altogether a good experience. From the online check-in to baggage claim, things were fine, quick and efficient, though I must note that on one or two of my flights, I wasn't given the seat I choose during online checkin for no explained reason. Planes were on time (fairly) and we got to each destination in time. I flew economy regular and it was more than acceptable with good legroom, good amenities like blankets, pillows, and we even got a little duffle bag with earplugs, eye cover and other things in it which was a nice touch. The inflight entertainment, though not to the level of Emirates or Qatar airways, was acceptable, though screens were low res and the selection was kind of limited. Bad things noteworthy are that staff may blatantly ignore you and delay requests and sometimes me and my American seat neighbour were pure skipped while handing out food and refreshments. Cairo airport is very acceptable, with a decent duty free section but has less than par bathrooms sadly and the constant begging for tips by porters got aggravating real fast. The food was very decent to be honest, can't fault them on that.

### "not fly this airline again"
Amman to Aswan via Cairo. Extremely disappointing. My first flight was delayed and upon arrival at Cairo for the connecting flight, I was met by an Egyptair employee (as we needed to rush) who asked me to get a visa, which I paid him 25USD (and another 25USD for my wife). Immigration then informed me that I did not need a visa - and the employee just shrugged at me without even offering to give me a refund. Next, our baggage missed our flight and we were given a compensation of 200EGP (10 USD) only as both pieces of baggage were booked in my wife's name. We had to pick up the luggage ourselves the next day as we came from an international flight, and the taxi ride cost us 30 USD return from our hotel - which was not covered. Not sure how you can just give 10 USD compensation when the taxi ride return from the city is 30 USD. Flight itself was not too bad, but after the above scenario, I will not fly this airline again.

### "Very nice airline"
Bangkok to Istanbul via Cairo. Very nice airline. My flight was 9:30 hours from Bangkok to Cairo. The seat was great for me there are PTV, usb port, headphone, blanket. The plane arrived early than the scheduled time. Very Well groomed flight attendants. The check in gate is friendly and quick, always watch when the check in give your baggage tag, all your baggage should get the tag. I arrived Cairo safe and transit for a flight to Istanbul. This Cairo to Istanbul flight is nice plane too. Small but okay because it take only 2 hours to fly. The meal on both flight is very nice. Eggs, sausage, bread, chicken, rice. Easy for all nationalities to eat. I got all my baggage on time and all my baggage is well taken. Great airline. Keep improving.

### "$30 for scuba equipment bag"
Hurghada to Cairo. We need to pay $30 for scuba equipment bag, so do not expect free baggage allowance for scuba equipment for this airline. Food on flight is just few butter cookie. I would expect more for full service airline.

### "service and hospitality commendable"
Mumbai to Toronto via Cairo. My experience with Egypt Air is simply exceptional. The service and hospitality provided by the crew are commendable and worth appreciating.

### "a fantastic trip"
Barcelona to Cairo. I was concerned about traveling on Egyptair but there was no real alternative. Check in and the flight were just fine: no problems at all. Egyptair was as good as any US domestic flight. The problem began when I forgot my small backpack under the seat. I didn’t realize this until we were all the way out to the taxi. The true colors of an airline show when they handle a problem. Starting with the taxi guide, everyone at the airport and the airline was wonderful. The taxi guide whisked me back through security, handed me off to a security agent and they quickly got me to Egyptair lost and found. There was my backpack with $2500 worth of electronics untouched. I was thrilled. Everyone was so nice. This was the beginning of a fantastic trip. Amazing country, astonishing archeology and wonderful people.

### "subsequently lost my luggage"
Abu Dhabi to Cairo. Would never ever fly with this airline again. Although I checked in through Etihad my flight was with EgyptAir. Had issues when transfering within the airport and the staff were incredibly rude and refused to listen to anything I was saying. They subsequently lost my luggage and have refused to acknowledge this. I have not once had a reply to any email, calls or tweets that I have sent. All of the numbers come up as invalid. I did receive a reply for a facebook message which was a copy and pasted version of their website instructions. I am disgusted with the whole experience.

### "cabin crew were friendly"
Not Verified |  Cairo to Bangkok. Its a good airline according to its price. It was a comfortable flight, cabin crew were friendly and always wanted to help, food was amazing with many choices of drinks (all alcohol free) and also they had a great choices of movies. Coffee was really good, also they had an internet connection but it was a bit expensive.

### "was no accommodation booked"
Johannesburg to Medina via Cairo. In January this year we embarked on a pilgrimage to the Holy Cities of Makkah and Medina. Our flights had been booked on Egypt Air. The agent who’d arranged the logistics of our journey assured us that Egypt Air was a decent airline and that our journey would be pleasant. We trusted him, since the journey to Medina, via Cairo, had been pleasant enough. We weren’t overly concerned about the 23 hour layover in Cairo that loomed ahead of us on the return leg. He guaranteed us that EgyptAir would arrange accommodation for our group and that we’d be issued transit visas which would allow us to do a bit of sightseeing before setting off for home. The children were especially excited about this. A chance to see the pyramids! When we stood in the queue at their passport control, never had I encountered an immigration official this rude! He demanded that transit passengers sit down! So we sat. We were a fairly large group, it turned out. Twenty five South Africans and a smattering of Nigerians. Anticipating a long-ish wait, we got comfortable. Greeted our fellow wayfarers, shared what food we had among us and waited. It was two hours before a bus was sent to collect us. We were then driven to the main airport building where we were just told to go upstairs. Here we found an Egypt Air Customer Services desk where a handful of agents were dozing on desks. When someone finally rose to come and see to us, we were told that since we’d arrived early in Cairo, there was nothing he could do for us. There was no accommodation booked. We should go and sleep in the mosque. We were stunned. Egypt Air Customer services aren’t big on responding to the same question twice, clearly. The agent became rude and surly at this point. Seeing that we would make no progress with this particularly unhelpful help desk at near 3AM, we sought out the prayer room. The ladies’ section was just about empty. The ladies and children huddled in groups on the stone-hard floor and tried to sleep. It was freezing! For the men, the night would turn out being much more uncomfortable. The men’s section of the prayer room was full of men who had hours to wait before their connecting flights.

### "very charming flight attendants"
Berlin to Cairo and back excellent airline, fast check-in, smooth boarding, very charming flight attendants, good food in quality and quantity, three choices, chicken, beef and fish IFE is overhead screens and some music channels, which is good enough for a four hours flight.

### "Not worth the extra money"
Hurghada to Cairo. Flight was on time, and luggage claim fast. Overall service was pretty poor. Domestic terminal was filthy. Paid for business class, but seats were identical, no business class lounge or boarding line. Only difference between economy and business is seat at front of the plane, and a small tasteless sandwich. Not worth the extra money.

### "Always expect an issue"
Not Verified | Cairo to Beirut. Worst airline I have been with. The couple of times I have been with them my flights got delayed. Fleet not so new and maintained. Crew not so professional. Always expect an issue when you decide to go for them; either a delay, mishandled baggage, paid seats cancellation, rudeness, discomfort.

### "good old style business class"
Rome to Cairo. Excellent service from check in to the flight. The Lounges at Rome Egyptair use Alitalia. There are a number of lounges. I used two, I didn't realise gate E had a lounge beside it. Good food selection, fine quality wines and spirits as Egyptair is a dry airline I filled up at the lounge. Excellent service. On board the hostess took my overcoat and hung it in the Wardrobe, I notice a lot of European carriers don't offer this service anymore. The flight had very comfortable seats for a two to three hour flight. Cradle type, just two seats beside each other in business much better than the usual tight European business class. The meal was very good, I had steak and the drinks even though non alcoholic were nice fruit juices. Relaxing flight and my bags were first off at Cairo Airport ready for my onward journey to the hotel. Overall good old style business class a great service, friendly smiling staff and uneventful flight.

### "wouldn't fly them again in economy"
Bangkok to London via Cairo. I was originally booked in business class for this flight, but I had to change my flight and ended up getting downgraded to economy. At Bangkok airport, there was a line for Business class passengers that looked rather long. Boarding was relatively organised, although I did manage to get on ahead of those seated in my zone. After takeoff, the crew dragged meal service for an hour and a half. On this flight, the catering was provided by Thai, and was the same thing I got on my flight to London with Thai. The only difference being served a salad with a hideous dressing instead of a meat appetiser. After meal service, I attempted to sleep. I was in the middle row, and there was two of us, my seatmate was on the right aisle and he slept in his seat without any problems. Even though I had three seats to myself, I couldn't get good sleep on this flight. The recline was too little. Ultimately I did manage to go to sleep after an hour trying to find a good (and awkward) position. A good feature of the seat is the footrest. A bad feature of the seat is the minimal head support, and I found myself wrestling with the headrest during boarding trying to get it up. They also gave us amenity kits. Which were the same amenity kits given to business class passengers. Transit is a good experience in Cairo, as you go through security at the gate. Unfortunately, something that didn't happen on my outbound flight was an organised boarding. They shouted "Bangkok" and people went sprinting to the gate. This time, they shouted "Business Class" and let business class passengers get on first. I was quite cross since this didn't happen when I flew Business. On this flight, I found myself calling the flight attendant repeatedly as my seatmate (Not travelling with me) was not served a snack when everyone else was served one. One of the funny things that happened on this flight was that there was a crying baby, but no one seemed to mind, including myself. I am not very happy with my Egyptair experience, and I'd take my word back where I said I would be alright to fly with them in business class, rather, I'd probably choose another Star Alliance carrier in future. Egyptair is quite a rubbish choice, and I wouldn't fly them again in economy, but I might consider their business class in the future.

### "I would recommend Egyptair"
Brussels to Cairo return. Beside a short delay inbound and outbound of about half an hour I have no complaints. Service was very good. Friendly crew, standard economy meal which tasted quite good and more leg space compared to most European airlines. Also the inflight entertainment system was ok. I would fly with Egyptair again and was very happy to see the transformation from a bad airline in the past to a good reliable airline now. So, in summary: friendly crew, sufficient flight entertainment system, satisfying food along with with a second serving of drinks with a slice of cake (an appreciated extra) and lots of leg space which is very important for me. I would recommend Egyptair. Airplane was a modern Boeing 737-800.

### "proved to be professional"
London to Bangkok via Cairo. I was quite sceptical when I booked Egyptair, their reviews weren’t fantastic but I booked them on the basis that they were a star alliance member (I needed the miles) and also because of a very cheap ticket (£1250). At Heathrow airport, I arrived 6 hours early for my flight (I do this often) as I wanted to avoid the rush hour Piccadilly line to Heathrow. I used the self check in desks however they didn’t work as well as my bag tag was printed but not my boarding pass. But the friendly Check in agent was able to print out my boarding pass. Air Canada lounge in Heathrow was really good, food offering was plenty and seats weren’t an issue. Boarding was relatively organised however a bit sluggish. There was an odd choice of drinks, strawberry juice (which has whole strawberries inside) and pineapple juice. We had a slightly late departure but not too bad. Food on this flight was relatively good, although I think I may have chosen the wrong main course, as the other options sounded better. The fish and prawns were a bit dry, but nothing too bad. The big issue was that my seatmate (not travelling with me) was given a vegan special meal he didn’t order. The seat was comfortable, and there was lots of legroom! Everything was where it needed to be, and the recline was plenty. Entertainment was alright, not too good but could be better. The crew on this flight were absolutely fantastic. The purser (with 38 years experience) was amazing. She provided such good service that most of the passengers couldn’t resist giving her a handshake as they left the aircraft. Transit in Cairo is chaotic, but you only need to clear security at the gate. The first lounge I went to was a smoking lounge (the entire airport already smelled of cigarette smoke) then the second was a similar story, after which I was directed to a non smoking lounge, small, and some people couldn’t sit together. Food offering wasn’t bad and I didn’t go hungry for my red eye flight. This time, the crew dragged dinner service for two hours after departure, and I had to skip dessert (luckily I ate in the lounge). The seat on the A330 is noticeably smaller than the 777. It’s the same seat compressed into a smaller cabin. Legroom was decreased and the seat recline slightly decreased. Departure was delayed by half an hour and flight time was increased by half an hour, which meant I had to run through Bangkok airport to connect to another domestic flight. The crew on this flight were a little less friendly than the London flight, but still proved to be professional. The seat was angled flat, which sounded good for me in theory, but wasn’t too comfortable as i spent the same amount of time trying to fall asleep as i would’ve if I’d have been sat in an premium economy seat. WiFi was offered at an expensive price, so I chose not to use it. Overall, i am quite satisfied with my Egyptair experience, and would certainly fly them again for the price offered as they have drastically improved from the last time I flew with them. There are still some old school charms about flying them, especially the way they present their meal service. The main reason I chose Egyptair was that they are a star alliance member. Although, I would more likely choose a different airline for long haul solo travelling as I would prefer a 1-2-1 business class.

### "luggage wasn’t to final destination"
New York to Sharm el Skeikh via Cairo. The flight was ok but first thing my luggage wasn’t to final destination. They have 10 flights daily to Sharm El Sheikh but this company put me on the last flight. I spent 11 hours in the horrible airport with no internet and no fresh food. One little coffee shop with poor food choices and no fresh. Customer service refused to take my baggage from me, at jfk they refused to send my baggage to final destination. It says on internet they would give you a hotel room if you have more than 6 hours layover. It’s a lie. No lunch, no hotel accommodation. To exchange your ticket on earlier flight they offer me to pay extra $250 why? There were free seats but they refused. I couldn’t go and see Cairo cause of my baggage which a normal company delivery to final destination. My trip was waste of time at the airport instead of enjoying sightseeing. I wouldn’t complain if my baggage was to final destination so I could have free hands to go outside. Their decision was to take all 3 luggage with me and walk around Cairo! Are you serious? Customer service didn’t find a solution. I had to pay for the full day and food at Sharm El Sheikh hotel which I didn’t use and won’t get my money back for that neither.

### "They lost our luggage"
Not Verified |  
Toronto to Cairo. Very disappointed with this airline. They lost our luggage, found it 17 days later! I filled out all that was required for reimbursement and then they stopped replying to my e-mails. I have e-mailed them 5 more times with no reply!

### "Would fly again definitely"
London to Guangzhou via Cairo. Both flights on time. Food good. Crew looked uninterested at times but hard working and dedicated. Lots of soft drinks including self service refills from the back galley. No alcohol served. Seats on B777 very very comfortable (actually one of the best economy seats I have seen) with good pillows and blankets and good space. Nice amenity kit provided (business class style). One of the deserts was a red velvet cake which was excellent and the chicken potatoe dish from London was also excellent quality. Nice side salad served as well. Pity no alcohol as a glass of wine would be nice but understand why not. Excellent value for money at about 40% cheaper than other regional carriers and the flight timings on this trip reduce jet lag. Would fly again definitely. Well done Egyptian.

### "The food was delicious"
Athens to Cairo. There is nothing special about this flight. However, I was surprised about the meal service. The food was delicious and well portioned, particularly for a 2-hour flight. In fact, it tasted better than some business class meal I had on long-haul flights. The equipment, a Boeing 737-800, was new and clean.

### "Great flight on Egyptair
Johannesburg to Frankfurt via Cairo. Great flight on Egyptair. I chose them because they were Star Alliance, and while the wine may not flow, the hard product on both the A330 and B737-800 is of a good standard as was the catering and the crew. Lounges in Cairo leave a little to be desired, food available was woeful, and something Egyptair needs to work on. Other than that, I was very pleased with the product and look forward to the trip back.

### "take no accountability"
Jeddah to Cairo. One of the worst airlines and it keeps getting worse. They simply do not care to provide a good service and also take no accountability. Delays, issues with food, faulty equipment. It’s always someone else’s fault.

### "Absolute value for money"
Entebbe to Amsterdam via Cairo. Both Fine flights. First part from Entebbe to Cairo in older 737 without any entertainment. But as it was in the middle of the night I did not miss this. Second part towards Amsterdam in a more modern 737 with entertainment and happier staff but also happier passenger perhaps because the more human moment of the day. I like the food at Egyptair and the ladies keep running with coffee and tea. Absolute value for money in my opinion with 40-60% discount compared to other European / Middle-East airlines flying to Entebbe.

### "I will not recommend"
Jeddah to Mumbai via Cairo. This is happen while I was returning from hajj to Mumbai. We were having big aircraft from Saudi Arabia to Cairo. We had hold of around 12 hours in Cairo. We boarded in flight MS968, since most of passenger are Haji's, some fellow passengers identified the baggage were not loaded in the aircraft. We had raise the issue with the authorities and requested to load our baggage and zamzam boxes. We are told we will receive all our baggage and zamzam boxes in hours after landing Mumbai Airport. As expected our half baggage was missing and zamzam boxes were not there. We waited on airport for 4 hrs but baggage never came. The authorities in Mumbai than promise to deliver the baggage to home which I receive after 3 days. But for Zamzam boxes I am following up with authorities for past 12 days and they keep on inventing new reason every time. I am not sure where to escalate the issue. There are other 50 passengers who are suffering same fate. Egypt Air authorities know this is every year issue but they just want to suffer the people. And don't want to take any action to improve there service. I am giving one star because they had flew us back to India. I am sure I will not recommend Egypt air to anybody. They completely ignore passengers grieves.

### "much improved airline"
London to Cairo return. A much improved airline. Efficient boarding at both LHR and CAI with a welcome from the cabin crew. Flight Manager on both trips was friendly and business-like. Standard of food is also improving and certainly passable, but it is still a case of quantity rather than quality. Good to have announcements from the flight deck, even if only partially audible.

### "a satisfactory flight"
Dubai to Cairo return, price was very competitive and timings were more suitable for me. Both flights were on fairly new A330-300 cabin was clean seats are a bit stiff and not very comfortable, however crew were friendly and smiling both flights were on time and arrived ahead of schedule. But the downside is the cleanliness of toilets, it was horrible that I couldn’t use. Entertainment system is limited to older movies and not good selection food on both flights was exactly the same breakfast with a tasteless rubber omelette and a piece of falafel and a cheese roll not the best quality and no options or choices. Overall a satisfactory flight for this short sector and price paid.

### "Very pleasant flight"
Athens to Johannesburg via Cairo. Very pleasant flight experience. Plane slightly dated without all the bells and whistles of Emirates. However crew very friendly and service on board great. The Purser in charge of our flight welcomed every one personally at their seat and apologized later in person for the delayed flight departure. Throughout the flight he  walked up and down aircraft to ensure all passengers were well looked after. Announcements were made clearly and audibly including those from the Captain. I have definitely seen a major improvement from our last flight with Egyptair. Well done and will  fly with you again.

### "They wanted to see visas"
Unprofessional customer service. It started in Johannesburg when the airline refused the boarding due to a 24 hour stopover in Cairo. They wanted to see visas for Cairo. Very arrogant and unprofessional Manager refused to even make effort to explain. When we notify customer service in Dubai of the situation, they referred us to send it in an email. After 7 times of trying to get hold of an agent, finally they told us there is nothing they can do to help. Every time we were put on hold and then suddenly they cut of the line while we are still on the line waiting. Finally we were told to write a complaint in an email and then it will be reviewed. We missed our flight at the end of the day and all they could say was write to us.

### "had the seat next to me free"
My return journey from Tokyo to Athens via Cairo, was much better than the one going out. Check in at Tokyo was very very slow as staff were extremely slow at checking in. Once past security, I used the United Airlines Lounge. Huge lounge, with comfortable seating, nice views, but limited food options (and pathetically small plates to serve yourself). The showers were very decent and well equipped. The main flight from Tokyo to Cairo was not bad at all. Again I had the seat next to me free which is always good. This time we got a basic (for business) amenity kit which is very important as the mask allows you to sleep much better. Seat comfort is ok, though very dated with angle flat seats but not too bad for the right price. Food this time was much better than the trip going out and the flight uneventfull. 6hrs wait in Cairo's terrible business lounge and off to the last leg of my journey. A short two hr flight. Service was ok seat comfort excellent (for a 737), but pretty sure I could smell the staff smoking which is unacceptable.

### "poor business class product"
Thought I would give Egyptair a go on business class this time for a long trip between Athens to Tokyo via Cairo. Check in in Greece was fast and swift at the business class counter. The Skyserv lounge at Athens airport is nothing special but at least its very clean and food decent in contrast to the one in Cairo which is run down and dirty. First leg of the flight on a 1yo 737-800 with very comfortable wide seats ok service and not too bad food for a 2 hr flight. I had a 9hr layover in Cairo so didnt spend much time in the lounge there (thank god!) The second part of the journey was on Egyptair's 777-300 ER. Business class was half full so I had seat next to me free which is good as Egyptair's business class product is very dated without much privacy. Seats are comfortable to sit on though the angle lie flat isnt the best to sleep in, but it did the job ok. The dissapointing part of this journey is that the crew didnt give amenity kit whatsoever, so we had no mask earplugs or anything (which was a shock) they just closed the windows to keep the plane dark which didnt help when the lights came on in the cabin during second food service. Service on the flight was ok, though very basic for business class and the food on this leg really bad (it was much better coming back). All in all a pretty poor business class product throughout, but if the price is logical worth it to have space to sleep during long flights.

### "generous baggage allowance"
Cairo to Copenhagen. Very old Boeing aircraft. Seats still have ashtrays and not all of them are in a good condition. Two entertainment options are provided: radio and overhead TV. Some flight information was wrong as it seems the company did not update the daylight saving times settings. An American movie was broadcast during the flight. Both the legroom and the meal were surprisingly good compared to other European airlines. The flight attendants are not very professional but this was balanced with their kindness. Cairo Airport was really crowded and had long queues on every occasion. The biggest pro with this flight was the generous baggage allowance (2x23kg) and good take off and landing times which are not overnight, very early in the day or very late compared to the other options.

### "issue with entertainment program"
Istanbul to Cairo. Counter Opened 2 hours before kicking off in one of the most crowded airports in the world (Istanbul). Many people were lined up and waiting so when counter opened there was a conflict which cause more latency. Plane had an issue with entertainment program.

### "very pleasantly surprised"
Cairo to London. I haven't flown Egyptair in over 10 years and from all the online reviews I wasn't expecting much. However, I was very pleasantly surprised to see how much the airline has improved. A very new aircraft, with excellent legroom in economy class compared to many other European airlines. Inflight entertainment was adequate for a 5 hour flight but not any longer. Food was excellent but it was the cabin crew that made the flight very pleasant; they couldn't do enough.

### "unprofessional and discriminatory"
Cairo to Tunis. A disappointing Egyptair flight. During Ramadan only snacks are served during daytime hours, this is unprofessional and discriminatory for non-Muslim travellers. The crew tried to make it up by offering me 3 sandwiches but it was overall a negative experience.

### "Plane at least 30 years old"
Flew Egyptair from Baghdad to Cairo. Plane at least 30 years old, Airbus 320. It still had ashtrays and the display called the Baghdad airport "Saddam International", the pre-2003 name. I suppose this plane had been used to fly the route in the 80s. Worst was that during Ramadan they kind of force passengers to fast by offering only sandwiches, the standard hot meal is only offered after fast breaking at sunset. It's ok for Muslim travellers but it shows they don't care about non-Muslim flyers. Luggage allowance was generous as the 23 kg rule per bag was not implemented. I checked in 27 kg but I wont be using them again during Ramadan.

### "Worst experience I've had"
Istanbul to Johannesburg via Cairo. Used Egyptian for a return trip. We choose the airline as it was cheaper. I guess you get what you pay. All 4 flights I took the cabin crew were not friendly at all and always being difficult. Some of them are so pulled up like it's an effort for them to do their job. Going from South Africa to Cairo I noticed a guy asking one of the airhostess for water, she was so rude and said can you be patient and let me do my job. I assumed something must have happened earlier hence she was being difficult. I experienced the same thing on my return trip it was a late flight and 4 year old wanted water as he has water before he sleeps. I asked one of the airhostess could I have a glass of water for my son. She walked up and down 3 or 4 times with newspapers and handing other people food and then bringing my special food yet again without water. It took her an hour to bring me a glass if water. This was really annoying especially for a 4 year old child to wait for water. Besides the service most of the seats were broken. My seat was always going back in the upright position on the return flight as well but after the water situation it was of no use complaining to the rude crew. Hopefully I don't have to fly again with them. Outbound flight from South Africa to cairo no entertainment as well. Worst experience I've had on a flight.

### "impressed by the crew"
I flew Egyptair on March 3rd, 2018 on the overnight flight from Heathrow to Cairo. The flight took off on time and landed in Cairo slightly ahead of schedule. As it was an over night flight there was not much in flight service, however overall I was impressed by the crew and their willingness to assist when called upon. The aircraft was new and clean.

### "This airline impressed me2
Cairo to Luxor. This airline impressed me. Sure, I only flew domestic, but you get an insight into their ground operation. It is truly impeccable. Flights on time, smooth procedures, very good amenities at lounge for domestic flight. Terminal 3 at CAI is up to current global standards. FA’s were friendly and spoke good English. Seats comfortable, plane was not the newest but cabin kept in excellent condition. Snacks provided. This airline seems a great option for travel to or within Egypt, and also as a gateway for Asian/African/Middle East from Europe or some American destinations (or the other way round). Consider flying them.

### "not be flying Egyptair again"
Johannesburg to Munich via Cairo. I am aware of cheap and affordable flying, which is what Egyptair provides, however I was not aware that service and in-flight service would be cheap too. The flight attendants were unfriendly to me as a woman, which is unacceptable. I am muslim, but not practicing because I choose not to. However, these men choose to greet my partner when it was me who initially spoke to them, thereafter they belittle me and don't want to look me in the eye and assist me for whatever reason or request I had. I understand that everyone has certain beliefs, but don't let that interfere with the service is provided and the business run. Despite the staff being sexist, there were inconsistencies in the aircraft too: one had modern tv screens playing the latest movies, the next hadn't been cleaned in a long while and had rickety sometimes completely broken seats and/or no tv's whereby to remain entertained, the food was the same each time I flew (which was return). I will not be flying Egyptair again nor will I recommend them, not matter how cheap the fare.

### "never use this airline again"
My partner and I flew return from London to Johannesburg via Cairo over Christmas and would never use this airline again. It started with a two hour delay, with no information available on why or for how long- nor any apologies- even from the pilot. Security was chaotic at check in. Although vegetarian meals were ordered for one party when purchasing the flights, non were allocated and took two different counter visits at Heathrow to rectify their mistake. One breakfast was a plate of grated carrots? All we wanted was sit down and enjoy a drink to celebrate the long saving up for this holiday only to find out this airline only serves soft drinks as ‘health and safety’? Two tiny cups were given in a four hour flight and no crew seen in between. Chaotic boarding again on return trip with long unnecessary queues. Pointed out the filthy toilets as we boarded but no action was taken. The trip ended with waiting over 2hours for our luggage. Just terrible.

### "never do this mistake again"
Madina to London via Cairo. Worst cabin staff, asked three times for the blanket but never provided. Staff seems really don’t want to do their job. Actually the staff need to learn some manners, flight is going to London and hardly any crew can speak English. Will never do this mistake again.

### "never do the same mistake again"
Jeddah to Athens via Cairo. Old aircraft, no usb charging option, unfriendly ground staff. The airline changed my flight 5 days before boarding with no explanation and demanded that I pay an extra hotel night and lounge use in Cairo due to 5+ hours stopover. I will never do the same mistake again!

### "crew just wanted to sleep"
London Heathrow to Cairo. What a wallop to the senses. The aircraft was old, had dated seats and washrooms and I am sure it was an old AA aircraft due to the toilets having AA insignia on it. Great leg room (33") and seat comfort OK. Cabin crew were awful. Lied about connecting flight and being held. When asked for water told none left, but a whole bottle came out when an Egyptian National asked. From take off, food service and drinks and tray collection - 1 hour 16 mins. The crew just wanted to sleep on the seats at the back, and they did. On landing, two passengers got up when landing gear was down and crew did nothing. Over head bins opened on landing again nothing.

### "bumped down to an Economy seat"
I was flying from Johannesburg to Cairo, however business seats were overbooked, and consequently I was bumped down to an Economy seat, albeit a very comfortable one. Without me prompting for any rectification of this problem, the ground crew manager appeared immediately and was sincerely apologetic. She kept me at the counter until the situation had been noted in writing and by the time I had reached the final leg of my journey (London to Toronto), my Economy seat had been upgraded to Business class and a boarding pass was waiting for me. In addition, other travel perks and refunding of points had been awarded. I received an email confirmation of all this. I understand that mistakes can happen, some situations cannot be changed but despite hearing about recent events where some airlines were not treating their customers with the expected courtesy, I was very appreciative of EgyptAir's immediate response for the way it handled this situation.

### "Two full meals with a snack as well"
Flew Egyptair from Toronto to Cairo. Pleasantly surprised. After reading all of the bad reviews about this carrier we were worried that it would a brutal 10 plus hour flight from Toronto with no alcohol service to soften the ride (dry airline). I'm happy to say that the level of service was on par with Cathay Pacific (Toronto to Hong Kong). Two full meals with a snack as well, flavourful and large quantities for airplane meals served with real cutlery. They provided blankets, pillows and a wonderful little travel kit that included a toothbrush, eye mask, socks, pen and moisture wipe. The washrooms were kept clean the entire flight and the airfract in general was clean and in very good shape. The 777 we took to Cairo was newer with more leg and seat room than the older model for the return flight. Book in staff as well as flight crew were all pleasant and fluent in English. The English movies are somewhat limited but you'll be able to find a few newer ones to fill the time (at the time of this review I was able to watch 'Birth of a Nation'). We would happily fly Egyptair in the future.

### "the worst airline I have ever flown"
Egyptair is the worst airline I have ever flown. I flew Business class from Johannesburg to Cairo. Firstly, the aircraft was very old and nothing was working. I tried to charge my phone, the socket wasn't working, the gentleman behind me also had the same problem. The TV must have been installed 100 years ago as it was the most difficult thing to navigate. You have to remind the air hostess several times just to get a glass of water (even in economy class with other airlines, they attend to you promptly). The food served was terrible. Luckily, it was an overnight flight, so I and most of the other passengers slept most of the flight. Upon arriving into Cairo, another problem started. I requested a wheelchair because I couldn't walk long distances. When I got to the counter, the very unprofessional staff told me to sit behind the counter with them because it was their "change of shift". I sat there for one hour, the guy told me I shouldn't be bothered because my next departure wasn't for another 2 hours. I was livid! I told him I needed to go to the lounge to relax before my flight and didn't want to sit there. When I got tired, I had to make the long walk to the lounge by myself. Worst airline experience, will not be flying this airline again.

### "worst flight experience "
Cairo to Beirut. This is my third boarding with Egyptair, Each time I told to myself that the bad traveling condition is just one time thing because I did not thought that an airline would be that much disaster. Rude staff, I don't know why they give a cheese sandwish which is not even edible, two flights were delayed and they gave us juice to confort us! It is the worst flight experience will never book with it again.

### "below average meals"
I travelled Business class from Cairo to Nairobi with Egyptair and was disappointed with a lot about the airline. The lounge - drink and food selection was mediocre, the seat pitch terrible, old seats on new aircraft, and below average meals with a very poor drinks selection. Ground service and cabin service was great.

### Egyptair customer review
Athens to Cairo. I am tall and the leg room was more then I have received on other airlines. The food was the best I have had on an airline, staff were great and plane was clean. We were also given free newspapers.

### "worst flying experience ever"
Abu Dhabi to Toronto via Cairo with my family of 5 including twin babies and it was the worst flying experience ever. Upon booking I called to request bassinets for the babies but was told to do so at the check-in counter. Upon arrival there I was informed it's a full flight and sorry but there's nothing they could do. So first leg we held our babies for 3+ hours. For leg 2 after much begging we were given 1 bassinet and for the 12 hour flight it was extremely difficult for us. I will go above and beyond to ensure my friends and family and their friends know never to fly with Egyptair.

### "plane was old and dirty"
We traveled from Oslo to Sharm El Sheikh and return after one week. Both ways the plane was old and dirty and the flight delayed. The toilet was closed and the seat was extremely dirty. I will never fly this airline again and I do not recommend it.

### "staff are generally pleasant"
I flew Egyptair from Cairo to Toronto recently. Some of my observations: The flight was slightly delayed, less than 15 min. Staff are generally pleasant and responsive. Most of business class seat controls were not working properly. Entertainment system is poorly designed. It looks like the interface was designed by a middle school student. No categories and no titles. If you are at the movies category, it refers to movie 1, movie 2. You only find out after you start the movie. The plane looks old and has not been updated. Food quality is average. When my wife requested a Diet coke, was told that they are having a problem with the supplier and they did not have any!

### "with 90s or even 80s style"
Cairo to Jeddah. I have used Egyptair many times and the last experience was the worst ever. I have faced very strange problems when I tried to cancel my booking and rebook again, the call center agent told me that you did this registration through our website and they are different department so you have to send them an email to request ticket cancellation, I asked him if he can give me how much I will be refunded to decided if the cancellation is worthwhile or not, but the answer was I can't help on that. Turned out to be a company that works with 90s or even 80s style. When I rebooked again, the airplane is very dated. The entertainment service onboard is useless, the seat is dirty and the seat tray table was broken. The flight attendants were very helpful and supportive, and that was the only good thing about this flight.

### "Overall an excellent flight"
Frankfurt to Cairo. Everything went pretty well. The plane took off and landed on time. Cabin crew were so attentive, well behaved and very nice. The flight was comfortable and not crowded that I could use 3 seats all by myself. The cabin was also clean and comfortable. Overall an excellent flight.

### "flight experience was modest"
Flew Egyptair from Toronto to Cairo. Crew were very helpful. Appeared to be making an extra effort to help. Flight experience was modest, I would say at best. Leaving from Toronto, helpful staff at check-in. Egyptair uses Air Canada lounge, which is average in service, overall comfortable. The plane to Cairo was quite dated, seat missing some parts, doesn't fully recline, and with a very very dirty screen. The plane back was better. For entertainment, Egypt Air has good new movies, but the system is not set properly to tell you which movie is on what channel. It just displays icons "movie 1, movie 2, movie 3". They provided a menu on the way to Cairo, but not on the way back. Food was reasonable on the way to Cairo, but unfortunately of very poor quality on the way back. The best part was the staff helpfulness, the worst part was Cairo Airport Lounger. Very filthy washrooms, leaky roof into the lounger, slippery floor from the leaky roof, and no one to clean, very limited simple selection of pastries and juice.

### "food fresh and tasty"
Istanbul to Dar es Salaam via Cairo with Egyptair. Flights on time or with minimal delay, our baggage was delivered, food was fresh and tasty, staff welcoming. Plane was small, but comfortable and nice. PTV screens available - just need to have your own headphones, because the ones offered by staff were useless.

### "worst flight experience"
Toronto to Cairo. Horrible experience. Apparently they switch from a Boing 777 to the A330 during low season, and the plane is abysmal. They must have purchased it in the 90s and never bothered refurbishing it. The business class seat was not a lie flat, it barely reclined, and to make things worse the foot rest did not work. The food was less than mediocre, and onboard entertainment system (antiquated with a tiny screen) did not work, no Audio. Worst of all there was something wrong with the air conditioning, the cabin was freezing the whole flight. One of the worst flight experiences ever, will not fly with them again and I'm a Gold member.

### "very negative experience"
Cairo to Nairobi. I booked this flight for its timing and date and had heard it was good. Much to my dismay, it was a very negative experience overall. My son said it all. This is the worst business class he has ever flown. The check in was painful and long, the luggage screening person would not hand me my passports back suggesting a "Tip" but finally did return them. They could not find my e ticket, the lounge was okay but the food was cold. Security took 45 mins,and there was no business fast track or boarding. The onboard service was mediocre as this was a night flight. The crew was only interested in eating and chatting with the security personnel. Being on an old Boeing 737 was not a restful sleep as the seats don't recline much and the constant chatter of staff.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Flew Cairo to Bangkok. No complaints, whilst this is not Emirates/Etihad standard the bonus is that it is a direct flight saving many hours. I was pleasantly surprised by the seat comfort in business class, it was certainly flat enough and comfortable enough to get a very good sleep on this overnight flight. Service too was very attentive and pleasant personalities. The big bonus is the cost of a business class ticket - considerably cheaper than the 'others'. I was also fortunate in having an on time departure with a smooth on time arrival. Good job Egyptair despite your knockers, you have a big tick from me - I'll definitely be back.

### "punctual and very comfortable"
Cairo to Aswan with Egyptair. The original flight 7am from Cairo to Aswan was cancelled, and I was offered the 8am flight, upgraded from Economy to Business class. I guess they compact the 2 flights together to maximise load factor. When I queued for the business class counter, the staff politely told me that the queue was for business, and I handed the print out from the ticket office before being processed for check in. Same thing happen when I was walking to my seat, the staff politely reminded me the seats are meant for business class passengers and asked to see my boarding pass. I have taken business class on other airlines before, and they don't judge based on your dressing so I don't know why the staff in this airline has a particular way of assessing whether someone deserves to be in business class. They certainly didn't do the same thing to another fellow who was upgraded. Food served on this short haul domestic sector was good, crew was ok. They have separate aircond shuttle bus for VIPs in Aswan airport, so even business class passengers can only take the non-aircond shuttle bus in the Aswan airport. Flight was punctual and very comfortable.

### "positive experience in economy"
My first flight with Egyptair, from Athens to Cairo. Positive experience in economy. They served a meal that I normally see in long-haul flights on this 105 minute flight. Flight was only around half-full. Service good from check-in in Athens to arrival in Cairo.

### "very friendly cabin staff"
Milan to Asmara via Cairo. Relaxed flight with Egyptair. Both flights were not fully booked, so plenty of space available. B737 was quite old, while A321 looked very new. Very friendly cabin staff, plenty of food, just no alcoholic beverages. One of the few carriers where you still can bring 2x23 kg even in Economy class.

### "not perfect, but is really not a bad airline to fly with"
We flew Johannesburg to Istanbul via Cairo. The Johannesburg to Cairo leg was operated by Egyptair's A330-300, Cairo to Istanbul by Turkish Airlines's A320, Istanbul back to Cairo by Egyptair's Embraer 170 and lastly Cairo to Johannesburg by Egyptair's A330-300. I've flown Egyptair many times and hated it every single time, however, the same can simply not be said for this journey. The first thing I realized when I entered the aircraft at JNB was the upgraded cabin. Each seat had finally (after all these years) been fitted with their own personal video screens. A very welcome upgrade from the then days of Egyptair's infamous drop down TVs. The selection of movies etc was pretty average but better than nothing at all so I'm not complaining. Egyptair's staff (most of them) seem to be from the stone ages and goodness knows they ain't going to win any beauty pageants but are so much more courteous than the 'pretty face but cold attitude type' flight attendants of many airlines. I personally feel that because English isn't their first language, some of their responses may seem rude, but yes, there is no denying that they have improved tremendously. Seats were comfortable enough for Economy class and had sufficient legroom. The food was also was not too bad and actually edible. They even served us with metal knives and forks. Cabin cleanliness was good and lavatories were like any other airline I've flown. The best part, however, was Egyptair's flight crew. Smooth take-offs and landings to the point that they were actually quite boring. Cairo Airport remains a dump as far as I'm concerned and leaves a lot to be desired, though I hardly think that's Egyptair's fault at all. All in all, Egyptair is not perfect, but is really not a bad airline to fly with. So thank you Egyptair for a wonderful journey. I would definitely fly with you again.

### "fairly average airline and experience"
Cairo to Luxor with Egyptair. Fairly average airline and experience, no real complaints. Seats weren't too bad, food was ok, flights were on time and staff were friendly. We had to take a bus onto the tarmac to get to the plane which was also prompt and fast. Overall I would say I'd book again with this airline.

### "really average flight"
London to Sharm El Sheik via Cairo with Egyptair. It seems completely ok continue using your phone during take off, play the safety video while you are taking off (which I couldn't hear due to noise of engines), have your seat reclined etc. They even let passengers get up and go to the toilet when the plane is queuing for the runway. I joined the plane as a business class passenger, sat in my seat and was asked to check my ticket - not sure why, nobody else was asked to prove they were in the right seat. We then sat for nearly an hour (including 30 minutes delay) where no refreshments were offered. When they were finally offered, by the time they got to me, there was just an orange juice and it was as if I was expected to take this drink when the other guests were offered choice The plane was ancient for a 5 hour flight and the seats even had ash trays as well as broken seats and TV screens. Really average flight, zero customer service and not something I'd repeat. I've had better economy experiences

### "I can recommend Egyptair"
Munich to Cairo with Egyptair in April 2016 This was my second trip with a band to play in Egypt. Each of the 6 of us had 2 pieces of luggage of 23kg allowance, and on neither leg of the trip was there the slightest problem with our instruments being checked in or taken as hand luggage. Plus, the seats on the plane were spacious and comfortable, the food was ok, staff friendly, both flights departed and landed on time, and there were none of the problems we'd had with other airlines before. I had tried in advance to get info about musical instrument transport from Egyptair through their different German hotlines and had failed, so I feared the worst, but at the end we were pleasantly surprised how stress-free it all worked out. Based on this one experience, I can recommend Egyptair, but especially to musicians and other people with other luggage than standard suitcases.

### "were more child friendly"
Medina to London via Cairo. I had low expectations from this airline but have to say Egyptair was above average. The Check-in staff were friendly and helpful the flights left on time, the crew would come as soon as you call them and were very friendly and helpful throughout the flight. We arrived early and the planes were not as bad as I thought. The flight from Cairo to London was smooth and one of the best landings I have ever experienced. I would fly with Egypt air again as they were helpful and child friendly as we had a 7-month-old baby and always gave us Bassinet seats. In comparison to Emirates, who I have flown with for many years, Egyptair were more child friendly.

### "crew polite and helpful"
Kuwait to Cairo return with Egyptair. Check in Kuwait airport was excellent and I have got my seat I chose online, boarding was on time. A warm welcome from cabin crew staff, aircraft 10 years old and the cabin looks very clean, takeoff was on time. Cabin crew bring newspaper and  earphones, then it was time for meal. Cabin crew polite and helpful, landing was on time and we received our bags quickly. Return back to Kuwait check in was excellent and boarding was on time. Again  a 10 years old A330-200, the cabin looks clean. No choices for breakfast but it was excellent except the bread served with the breakfast.

### "seat width a bit tight"
Larnaca to Cairo with Egyptair. Small Embraer 170 plane was probably half full. Good legroom in economy but seat width a bit tight - minimal elbow room for two people especially if you wanted to read or work. Cabin crew were efficient getting the food and drink around but unhelpful with passenger enquiries - e.g. which type of immigration card was required. Limited soft drinks selection. Food was largely worst kind of airline food outside budget airlines - rubbery chicken, some sort of salami concoction, plastic cheese and tasteless breads. In-flight information from cabin and crew almost non-existent. Prompt departure from LCA and arrived on time. But plane stood on tarmac at Cairo for 15 mins until the door was opened as the bus to transport us to the terminal had not arrived - maybe more the fault of the airport authorities than the airline, but no explanation given by the crew which just frustrated people.

### "a reasonable experience"
A reasonable experience with Egyptair flying from London Heathrow to LXR. A rather tired-looking aircraft with drop-down overhead screens. Cabin staff pleasant and helpful but the choice (beef or beef) and quality of the meals was distinctly three star. A short, uninformative announcement from the flight deck on the outward leg but no announcements at all on the return leg.

### "crew warm and friendly"
Egyptair has always been the main airline that I rely on for travel and my last trip in January from Istanbul to Cairo was smooth and flawless. We departed on time and arrived 30 minutes early. The cabin crew were warm and friendly, few inflight entertainment options on the system but the flight was short (approximately 1 hour 30 minutes). The ground service was smooth and we claimed our baggage quickly upon arrival.

### "cannot recommend airline"
Mainly booked this Egyptair trip because we got a great price on a flight/hotel package in Sharm el Sheikh. That said, lets say that a great price is a great price for a reason - and usually not a good reason. Before even getting on the plane my customer service nightmare had begun. Our original flight was IAD to LHR (10hr Layover) and then to CAI and SSH. Well about two weeks before we leave, Egyptair cancels our layover in LHR, thus getting us into SSH a day early. That sounds great, but now I have to pay for an extra night of hotel. When I told Egyptair the issue caused by the change, they refused to let us cancel, reimburse any of the extra hotel night. In the end, I just sucked it up and paid. As for the flight itself, the leg from LHR-CAI was a pleasant surprise. We were on a well maintained A330 with decent entertainment and food. No complaints there. On our flight from CAI-SSH, the plane was an old B737. Bottomline - the flights were ok, but the customer and ground service was so bad that I cannot recommend this airline.

### "do not recommend airline "
Flew Egyptair and the flight was almost empty from Bangkok to Jakarta. The check-in staff were helpful. The economy cabin was not clean and I could still see a lot of rubbish from the previous flight. The cabin crew were unfriendly and rude. They did not welcome passengers entering the aircraft. The food was served very quickly. I only had 5 minutes to enjoy my foods and suddenly the cabin crew just took back my unfinished food without asking if I was ready or not. The price for Bangkok to Jakarta sector was OK for the full service airline, in comparison with other airlines which offer the route. I do not recommend this airline and will not book flights with them in the future.

### "service attentive and cheerful"
Cairo to London Heathrow, and Egyptair looks as though it might be beginning to get its act together. Check-in at Cairo was very quick and efficient. The business class lounges were however very crowded, and not at all relaxing. Cabin service was attentive and cheerful. The quality of the food is improving but there is still a long way to go before it is comparable to 4 star airlines. Still no announcements from the flight deck.

### "a terrible experience"
Egyptair flight from Toronto to Dubai via Cairo on December 28 was a terrible experience. There was an initial delay where we were told that there was a malfunction on the plane. Then 2 hours later the flight was cancelled with no or minimum announcement. No crew members were available to answer questions nor they did have answers. The flight was re-booked for the next day, and was set to arrive on the 31st at 3am. I had an appointment on the 30th that I needed to get to so I asked to talk to customer service. This was another terrible experience as the constant answer I was given was 'no I can't do that'. I believe that Egyptair needs to change its attitude towards issues regarding cancelled flights. Please avoid, as if something goes wrong, you are on your own.

### "cheaper than the competition"
Abuja to Cairo. I've flown Egyptair numerous times and they are good value, offer a 46kg baggage allowance in economy and are much cheaper than the competition. Best thing is that few Egyptair flights are full so you often have a row to yourself, and there is plenty of food on board. It's a state carrier so some staff are not trained up like in Europe but I always found them helpful. I never lost a bag or missed a connection. Yes there is no alcohol and the entertainment system is pathetic in economy class. Just bring a good book.

### "a nice surprise"
I was a little skeptical before flying Egyptair but it was a nice surprise. The flight from Cairo to Barcelona was great,  staff was professional and kind. Great choice of food on offer. I tried and absolutely delicious beef stew. The plane was half empty so I got a nice nap in the back.

### "the cabin staff great"
I reckon most reviews are done after negative experiences. But I have recently flown both Business and Economy with Egyptair, both on 6-hour flights on different routes (Cairo to London). The seating in both was far more comfortable and spacious than BA, the food excellent, and the cabin staff great. They also have good entertainment systems and a wide up-to-date choice of films. Also very good value in economy. I have a feeling this is a very underestimated airline, and I will fly them as preference again.

### "staff were pleasant and helpful"
Egyptair from London to Cairo. Departed 30 minutes late but made up the time en-route. The cabin staff were pleasant and helpful. The food was pretty average. Two negatives : first, no announcements from the flight deck were provided, and on arrival a large number of economy passengers invaded the business class section before any business class passengers had de-planed. It was a complete shambles.

### "deleted my return flights"
10 hrs late leaving Accra, missed connection in Cairo, changed route to Yangon and in the process (without informing me), and Egyptair deleted all my return flights. Despite having the tickets in my hand not allowed to board the flight home. Left stranded in Yangon and Egyptair are now saying I have to purchase another flight to get home - no compensation for tickets they accidentaly deleted from their system when they chose to re-route the flight here, or for extra hotel costs or stress or anything. Any airline that messes up so badly they leave their passengers stranded in a foreign nation is best  avoided. When they won't even let you on the flight paid for, the rating for everything is 0.

### "needs to change its attitude"
I traveled via EgyptAir during my latest trip to Paris from Cairo. The ground services at Cairo Airport was acceptable if we exclude extensive security checks. I was allowed to check-in two bags for free. The outbound flight was fine except for a malfunctioning controller for the entertainment system and mostly aged cabin crew members. The food was not bad for me. During my inbound trip, the ground services at CDG allowed me to only check-in 1 bag, while they asked me to pay for the other one, and that was not acceptable. I was not notified about this situation before the flight. Fortunately, however, the other one was small enough to be taken in the cabin. The flight was initially delayed for about 45 minutes. The cabin crew were much younger this time while were mostly males. The entertainment controller did work this time, but I had a broken USB port! I believe that Egyptair seriously needs to change its attitude towards baggage issues. It used to be my favorite airline and a source of national pride to me, but not anymore!

### "avoid as it is very mediocre"
Cairo to London return, and Egyptair is reliable in always taking off late and serving terrible food. On my outward journey a 40 mins delay, according to the Captain our delay was caused by busy air traffic over Cairo (ironic and difficult to believe under the circumstances). Inbound journey arrived late from Cairo and we departing 1 hour late. The only thing this airline has going for itself is the baggage allowance of 46kg. Otherwise, avoid as it is very mediocre.

### "Terrible experience"
Egyptair flight from Cairo to Toronto on November 21st 2015 on MS995 was a terrible experience. The flight was delayed 3 hours, was supposed to take off at 1:15am instead took off after 4:00am whilst we were inside the airplane with no or minimum announcement. Around 3:30am the airplane was fully shut off for almost 5 to 10 minutes, which caused state of panic as there was no lights. No crew members were available nor they did have answers. Then the captain made announcement that the airplane is fully functional now, some passengers yet wanted to get off the plane, crew refused at the beginning and then advised no refund would be applicable. The crew members responded to concerns "we are here since 10 PM" raising there voices on passengers. We finally took off while everyone was tensed, when we arrived no apology from the captain or even any announcements. Terrible experience.

### "attendants not friendly"
Cairo to Hurghada with Egyptair. Check in was fairly smooth and lounge access at Cairo Domestic was okay. Not much on offer in the lounge besides some sandwiches. Food offered onboard was almost ok for such a short flight, but only given to those in business class. Business class seats were just economy seats with the first four rows separated from the rest by a curtain. It was impossible to understand the flight attendants when they were speaking English. Even their Arabic was poor according to another passenger on the flight. Flight attendants not friendly and not interested in their job. The aircraft was very dirty inside and you could not see out of the windows properly suggesting the outside of the plane could have also been cleaned. Overall it wasn't a great experience on the flight and I wonder how this airline is part of the Star Alliance.

### "unworthy of Star Alliance"
Egyptair is probably the weakest link among the Star Alliance network. During this trip aside from experiencing a very unfriendly attitude from the flight crew including the burnt hot dog omelet breakfast which they never replaced, they also managed to lose my bags upon arrival. Bags do get lost and this is common to all airlines. However what shocks me is that Egypt Air agrees to compensate me for the loss of my bags but never actually pays (it has been six months now). They don't even answer my e-mails requesting an explanation on the situation and their call center tells me to e-mail the baggage services. This is an endless pernicious loop of irresponsibility. Egyptair is unworthy of Star Alliance.

### "pilots smoking in the cockpit"
We flew Egyptair from Milan to Cairo return, as well as Cairo to Luxor return. The flights were fine. The food was ok, but passable considering. (No liquor). The seats were comfortable and had a reasonable recline. The service was polite and friendly for the most part. The fast track service through passport control and security, as well as lounge access made the moderately higher price well worth it for Business Class. When arriving in Luxor and Cairo (where we had to disembark away from the gates) they had a separate shuttle bus for Business Class passengers to take you to the terminal. Another nice perk. However, on each of our four flights the pilots were smoking in the cockpit throughout the flight - this is despite "no smoking" stickers plastered everywhere for passengers of course. The smell and eye burning that occurred throughout each of our flights, made this at times unbearable. After our first flight I googled the issue, and it appears this is a common occurrence by the pilots on EgyptAir. They obviously don't care or it wouldn't be tolerated, but this should be banned asap! I'd recommend this airline if they enforced a ban on smoking for pilots inflight.

### "enjoyed my Egyptair flight"
I enjoyed my Egyptair flight from Alexandria to Casablanca, the staff is vey helpful and friendly. The pilot was very professional even in his annoncement because we were delayed becuse of airport traffic. Egyptair need to work on the inflight entertainment as it was 6 hours flight.

### "a good experience"
Flew on Egyptair from Athens to Jeddah via Cairo. Was delayed leaving and arrived slightly late, however they waited for us to arrive and took us by bus to the connecting flight. The flight to Jeddah from Cairo was by a new Boeing 777. Very spacious and nice plane. A big positive for this airline is that they allow 2x23kg baggage per passenger in Economy which is a big plus for me. Service good and all in all a good experience.

### "flights quite comfortable"
Flew Egyptair from Athens to Khartoum and return to Vienna, via Cairo in both directions. CAI-VIE being served by Austrian. These flights were quite comfortable. The food was surprisingly good, but it's a pity that they don't serve alcoholic drinks as a glass of wine would come handy. All flights on time or early. Cairo airport is really impressive after all the rebuilding, although cafeterias and restaurants are pricey.

### "have a way to go"
We were on our way to Nairobi for a safari. We flew Egyptair from London to Cairo to catch another plane to Kenya. Our A330 aircraft was showing its age, and our seat in business class was also a little worn. The business class section had 2-2-2 seating, and it was fully booked. Our seats came down at an angle to the floor. Since it was a five hour afternoon flight I didn't need to sleep. But I think the seat should allow for adequate sleeping if the aircraft were taking passengers on an overnight flight. The food selection was just okay, much worse than airlines such as Lufthansa or Air Canada. The cabin service was also not at the same level. However Egyptair has come a long way since we last flew business class with them ten years ago from NYC to Cairo. But they still have a way to go to catch up with the other members of the star alliance.

### "worst airline I have been on"
Egyptair is for sure the worst airline I have been on, and should not be part of Star Alliance. Since its the only direct flight between Cairo and Khartoum I am forced to take it. I was supposed to fly on the night flight leaving 4am, arrived at the airport three hours earlier to find the flight delayed for an hour which was acceptable. When I went to check on the status their staff closed the office and left - all of them disappeared leaving passenger waiting outside the airport with no info, so you had no idea to go home or stay. The next time we saw them was at 9 am - they were rude and did not care, providing no info on when the flight will take off. Eventually it took off 12 pm next day, an 8 hour delay. Plane was dirty, crew was rude, no food was served as it expired and no one cared providing an apology. Their crew even said we were stuck like you, so dont complain - although their crew spent the night at a hotel unlike the passengers who spent it on the street in front of the terminal. Avoid these guys at all cost in the future.

### "would not recommend Egyptair"
Connecting from Istanbul with Turkish I had plenty of time to spent at the T3 which is supposed to be the new airport, but that's the worst terminal I ever been. The first lounge I approached had to close at 11pm so I moved to another one until a gate was dedicated for my flight. Security check at boarding gate pretty slow and rude. As I don't need a visa for Canada the guy insisted to run an investigation why I am going to Canada and wanted pretty much personal data. Push back delayed by almost 60 minutes. Aircraft pretty good but the purser was totally unrelaxed. Upgrading of Egyptair staff family and friends at the aircraft door is another issue I was amused by. Food was ok but for a business class pretty lame. IFE is outdated. After landing they first disembark the C class pax in the front section while I was seated in the second section I was forbidden to leave. As I had no luggage I was a bit surprised about this action. I told the purser that's pretty lame and rude. The return flight was the same disaster. Rude check in people. Chaotic boarding. 1hr delay for departure. Arrived on time but in a bus gate. Pretty lame to disembark 309 pax through a bus gates even the large jetways were empty. Baggage delivery took 30 minutes. I would not recommend Egyptair when served with the old A330-200.

### "service in business class poor"
The Egyptair check in went a little slow even at the C Class counter. Fast track for immigration was good. The lounges are overcrowded in the morning hours with very poor selection of food and beverages. Before Boarding another slow security check and stupid questions from the security guard. Flight was delayed due to no reason for almost 1 hr. The service in business class is poor. IFE is outdated. Arrival in FRA at a bus gate that's 20 mins away from terminal. Bags was delayed by almost 45 minutes. Pretty disappointing. I recently recommend to check KLM or Turkish on this leg.

### "avoid them at all cost"
We boarded at 22h40 and when we got to the runway we turned around. The Egyptair pilot said there was a documentation problem and we would be delayed for 15 minutes. We sat in the plane with no aircon. 2 hours later the captain speaks again and says the problem is sorted and we need to refuel and we would leave in 10 minutes. The next time he spoke to us was 2.5 hours later when we were ready to go. 5 hours in the plane with no aircon before take off. Toilets were unable to flush and we were given a cup of water in all that time. In flight entertainment was like it was in the early 90 s. We got our next drink with breakfast. Breakfast was basic and stale. Staff were rude. They didn't bother to update the flight info and my wife arrived 4 hours early. They should not be part of the Star Alliance - avoid them at all cost.

### "adequate legroom for economy class"
London to Luxor via Cairo. flight London to Cairo on A330-300 was on time. Comfortable seating with adequate legroom for economy class. In flight service good. Crew pleasant. Food and beverage service of acceptable quality. Inflight entertainment okay if you speak Arabic and enjoy shockingly bad "action movies". Internal flight Cairo to Luxor on Embraer 170 offered drinks service only, but flight just one hour. Luxor to London on Boeing 737-800. Comfortable enough seating but narrow and with very restricted space and legroom inadequate. Seat backs involuntarily recline on a number of seats around us which added to the space problems and general feelings of dissatisfaction. Cabin crew pleasant, food inedible. Flight left on time but with addition of stacking over London Heathrow flight extended to very nearly six hours. A seriously unpleasant experience. There are only two lavatories for 132 economy passengers on the Egyptair Boeing 737-800 which doesn't work.

### "would not recommend it at all"
I I was in Milan airport 12pm waiting for my flight to Cairo by Egyptair flight at 6pm. I've been waiting for my flight until 10pm when the crew decide to cancel our flight to next day at 2:30pm. They manipulated us for 4hrs until they announced the cancellation of the flight and booked us an hotel 1hr away from the airport. We were at the hotel by 00am and we had to checkout by 11 and take a bus to the airport by 12pm Friday for the flight at 2:30pm. The hotel announced that we would have our lunch at 12pm same time of the departure from the hotel and nobody from egyptair showed up, the bus came at 2 and we were at the airport at 3pm where we found there was not a flight at 2:30pm - the next flight was 6pm were fully booked and not enough seats for everyone so we should wait for another plane either at 9pm or 12:10am on Saturday. The Egyptair representative refused to return us to any hotel and offered me either to wait for a 12:10am flight or he would book an hotel and take next day flight and that was what I have chosen. He refused as is not worth it to stay in hotel for next day while I can wait much longer at the airport for night flight. The flight came at 11pm and ready for take off at 00am, but the flight has been delayed again to 1am. We had the worst plane ever, uncomfortable seats, unwelcomed crews and dirty. The seat even does not lean back. I would give it a zero star but i have to pick at least one. I would not recommend it at all.

### "professional and attentive crew"
Flew Egyptair from Cairo to Barcelona and back, with both sectors operated by Boeing 737-800s. First leg was a morning departure from Cairo, which is when the majority of Egyptair flights to Europe leave from Terminal 3. Be prepared for queues at security and check-in. At check-in requested, and was assigned exit row (extra legroom) seats. Onboard professional and attentive crew. Passenger passed out mid-flight and this was dealt with in a professional manner. Seats comfortable enough. No personal IFE, only radio and overhead monitors, so be prepared to take a good book or chat with your neighbor. Crew did a drink run in the beginning followed by the lunch service (chicken or meat). Meat was served with pasta in bechamel, and one of the better meals I've had with the airline. On-time arrival into Barcelona. Return there was a 2-hour delay which we were informed of at check-in). Passengers were given meal coupons valid at a number of food outlets. Flight left 2 hours behind schedule. As this was a flight going from west to east, the winds were with us and flying time was just 3h50 compared to 4h15 coming over. Again, pleasant in-flight service and an adequate meal (the hot dish was catered from Barcelona and was chicken or beef). Egyptair gives 2x23kg baggage allowance. Would recommend.

### "rude flight attendants"
My first time on Egyptair from Amman to Cairo, and will be the last. There was a mass scrum at check in. Flight as delayed for 4hrs and we sat on the plane. When one passenger asked why, the stewardess began to shout at the gentleman in Arabic. Rude flight attendants. Old decrepid plane. The cabin safety video did not work.

### "would happily fly Egyptair again"
Comfortable Boeing 737 aircraft in business class, and pleasant crew on my Egyptair flight from Cairo to Madrid. The food choices were adequate and I was pleased with the onboard service. The inflight entertainment was mediocre at best, but luckily I brought my own media along. In summary, I would happily fly Egyptair again.

### "Egyptair is not fit for purpose"
Egyptair is not fit for purpose. They are so laid back, unprofessional and quite rude. We booked 5 seats round trip Sharm el Shiekh to Cairo. We made sure that our tickets were all confirmed both ways. On our return trip, we arrived at Cairo Airport, progressed to the check-in desk only to be told that "the flight was overbooked and there were no seats available". We were then told to take a seat and someone from Egyptair will come to talk to us. The Ground Crew were not busy at all other than talking rather than focusing on the service that they were meant to deliver. Having waited for 20 minutes for a member of Egyptair to come and explain to us the reason behind their cock-up and why they allocated our confirmed seats to somebody else, but to no avail. I then approached the check-in desk to enquire why nobody has been to see us. About 10 minutes later someone appeared and came to talk to us. He did not offer any apology or exeplanation why they allocated our confirmed seats to somebody else. Clearly this demonstrates the behaviour and the unprofessional conduct of their practice which had become apparent. They compensated us with 3 seats only @ 235.00 LE each and they refused to compensate for the other 2 seats, making their own law. I tried to resolve the issue with Egyptair, but no one wanted to know and they should be ashamed of themselves.

### "one dissatisfied customer"
I am one dissatisfied Egyptair customer. I booked 2 roundtrip tickets Istanbul to Cairo on the Egyptair website. Travel was scheduled for April 2015. Because of bombings in Cairo, Sharm el Sheik, Alexandria later the week of March 11, my Egyptian host and I decided we should cancel the trip since those were our destinations. I cancelled the tickets in the computer on March 16th. I cannot get any response from Egyptair even though I have tried for months. Don't book your trip with Egyptair because if you cancel the tickets for good cause, you will not get any money back nor will anyone from Egyptair have the courtesy to answer phone calls and emailed messages.

### Egyptair customer review
We flew Egyptair with two 8 month old infants and a 10 year old child. I contacted Egyptair to reserve cots for my twin boys and the person I spoke to said it can't be booked over the phone, we need to make sure we there 5 hours before so we can check in first to get the cots. On the day of travel we got to Heathrow 5 hrs before departing and checked in first. I asked the man who checked us in if he booked us the cots and he said yes, it's all booked. When getting on the plane to Cairo he didn't book our cots and we were on normal seats where we had to keep our twins in our arms for whole flight. When arriving in Cairo we were looking for our pushchair, as they said we will get it when getting off the plane, and it wasn't there. So had to carry our twins around for our 2.5 hour transit. When asking ground staff where our Pram was, they were rude and said we don't have time to get our Pram. Finally when getting on our next plane to Johannesburg they gave us the right seats but only with 1 cot. They didn't even have baby seatbelts like other airlines. When arriving at Johannesburg, again our Pram wasn't there when we got off the plane. I will never fly with Egyptair again!

### Egyptair customer review
Airport experience was terrible. Hassled to make payment to someone who places your luggage on the security belt - this is prior to entering the check-in area. I refused to let him take my luggage and placed it on security belt myself. Check-in process was long, but staff were quite helpful in the business/gold class section. Finding the lounge was difficult but eventually found it - although the facilities are not to the standard in other airports. Aircraft was an ancient small 737-500 with very uncomfortable seats, and a very bad mannered crew. This aircraft was all white and had no Egyptair livery. The temperature in the cabin was very hot. Food was not nice and the cabin was dirty. Heavy delays coming into Istanbul due to air traffic. Will try to avoid this airline where possible.

### Egyptair customer review
Smooth check-in via airport self service kiosk. Boarding process delayed and chaotic. Passengers mostly unable to follow instructions and place bags in overhead lockers. Disinterested cabin staff during the flight. Cabin crew not enforcing any safety requirements especially when passengers are opening over head lockers while plane is taxiing. Plane was dirty with food remnants and stains on tray tables from previous flights.

### Egyptair customer review
I flew Egyptair 5 years ago and was impressed. This time I was disappointed with the level of services on board, food, and the staff. Staff went through the plane before take off casually yelling: belts, belts, straighten your seats. English was not formally used assuming that most of us spoke Arabic as our first language, we actually had English only speaking travellers who were not impressed. After serving the first meal, the lights were turned off for 6 full hours. To make things worse, the seatbelt lights were constantly on even though we didn't have much turbulence. People were looking for drinks but staff were not to be found. I finally decided to get up and look for water and found 3 attendants sitting in the back, when I asked for water she pointed at the lights as if I'm to be blamed for getting up after 3 hours of waiting. Staff avoid eye contact to avoid requests.

### Egyptair customer review
My husband and I were travelling to Egypt for a long weekend break. On arriving Nairobi airport, there was a 30 minute delay on the flight (acceptable), so the flight was leaving at 8.30 instead of 8.00am. We boarded the flight and by 8.30 we were ready to take off. Then there was an announcement that there was a mechanical problem and will be sorted in 5 minutes, those 5 minutes turned into 2 hours and all passengers were getting apprehensive as the crew kept on saying 5 minutes and then we were told to disembark. So everyone got out of the plane and within literally 5 minutes we were all called back on, saying the flight is now ready. We all boarded and guess what sat in the flight again for two hours with the same 5 minute story. At 12.30pm we were told the flight is now cancelled and to disembark again and would be given more information outside. We waited for another 1 hour for our bags and the crew told us that they are trying to get another flight on the same day (Saturday) or we wait will Monday to fly out as they don't fly on sundays. Considering we were coming back on Tuesday that was a pointless option, we then spoke to the Egyptair Nairobi Airport Manager who said there was no way we would fly on the same day so we had to wait till Monday. His assistant told us that there was an Ethiopian airline flying in a couple of hours if we wanted to take that and then return with Egyptair on Tuesday as schedules. They agreed to the same and signed our ticket for a full/part refund. We even double checked with him if we flew with Ethiopian airline one way to Cairo would Egypt air refund our one way ticket - to which he said yes and even spoke to our travel agent on the phone. We then took the Ethiopian airlines (paid extra) and reached Cairo. Its an amazing city with amazing people. On the way back on Tuesday, Egyptair had cancelled our return so we had to get that sorted and after another 3 hour wait in the flight due to mechanical fault again the flight took off and got to Nairobi not forgetting we reached work late on Wednesday because of the flight delay. Back in Nairobi when our travel agent asked for the refund to get sorted from Egyptair, it took them a month to reply and they said they will not refund our one way ticket. This is the most ridiculous customer service we have ever received especially after all the inconveniences caused to us by Egyptair. Wasted 8 hours at the airport, had to take another flight and spend extra money and not one person from Egyptair apologized or even cared. A good number of us used Ethiopian airlines that Saturday as Egyptair promised a refund. It is the most horrible airline and I would not recommend anyone to travel with it.

### Egyptair customer review
Seat is comfortable and service was surprisingly good. Food was also good. Lack of good entertainment and poor pilot announcements is a disadvantage. Ground service in Cairo Airport was nothing memorable.

### Egyptair customer review
I consistently use Egyptair to visit family in France and the UK. It is my favourite airline because of the comparatively low ticket prices ability to change route and dates on tickets on even the cheapest tickets (also refundable) booked directly with the airline and the 46kg baggage allowance where other airlines only permit 20kg. The CAI-CDG and CAI-LHR routes are mostly served by newer Airbus 330s which are vastly superior to the old Boeing 777s. Pay attention to the aircraft type which is displayed when booking on the Egyptair site. I would not travel on a 777 with a young baby for instance as there is nowhere to place the bassinet except on the floor by your feet and they do not allow you to bring a car seat. There are also no infant seat belts as they claim these are unsafe. The 330 in contrast is pretty comfortable with a wide choice of inflight entertainment and good leg room in the front row. Food is fine. Kids meals are larger than the adult meals and are usually pasta with tomato sauce plus grilled chicken breast. Adult meals are bread roll plus butter with a main meal of rice plus meat plus sauce. You have a choice of red meat chicken or fish. The dessert is usually inedible and 80s looking. Staff have always been polite and accommodating especially when I was flying alone with young children. It is certainly not a premium airline but if cost and flexibility matter to you then I would recommend them for shorter flights. Take care always to book directly with them though so tickets are refundable.

### Egyptair customer review
LHR-CAI-JNB and return. Both ways the aircraft to and from London to Cairo was much newer than that from Cairo to JNB and back to Cairo. When did they ban smoking on aircraft? The flights from Cairo to Joburg still had ashtrays in the seats and toilets! The food was awful the worst that I have ever had on a flight from England. The staff were efficient enough but smiles were few and far between. I am going back to Turkish.

### Egyptair customer review
JFK (NY) to Jeddah via Cairo on May 26th. I travel every 6 weeks from New York to Saudi Arabia. This was my first and most definitely the last time on Egyptair. Unfortunately I have nothing positive to say about this airline. Business class seat was OK but the service and food was horrible. If you have flown with premium airlines like Qatar and Emirates then you are in for a shock. After getting on the plane no one acknowledged or welcomed me during the whole flight. After 20 minutes I was offered a hot "paper towel" followed by a choice of orange or guava juice. No one even said Hello to me during the whole flight. Food was served in a rush. Horrible dried out food. No snacks during the flight. Bags of nuts were distributed when plane was about to land at Cairo. Breakfast was worse than the dinner. IFE was not good at all with cheap head sets. Amenities bag was actually a zip lock bag. My completely unbiased advise - stay away from this airline.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew from Athens to Cairo and back. Aircraft I flew one of the very few Egyptair planes I have seen which still had the old paint scheme giving you some idea of the age of the plane. Inside aircraft upholstery did seem rather old and there were scratch marks on the wings and engines. No inflight entertainment system. Food was pretty good and cabin crew welcoming and pleasant. Boarding starts 1 hour before take off in most cases so hold this in mind when planning a journey. There was not much room in the seat and I felt cramped. When I transferred to another airline to catch my connection I appreciated just how cramped Egyptair was.

### Egyptair customer review
Flight 848 May 13. Flight 753 May 16. My recent flights experiences with Egyptair Business class were very positive. I had much more space and better food than on recent flights with American and BA. All flights were on time and the service was excellent. The flights attendants were positive. Both cabins were clean and there were English newspapers/magazines. I watched a total of four recent movies and had no complaints with the entertainment system. Additionally there was more than enough food offered during the flight. Since I do not drink alcohol I had no issues with their beverage selection. Both lounges Casablanca and Cairo were adequate. I had Internet access and a seat. The lounge staff in CAI were very nice and I enjoyed a coffee and croissant before departure. The restrooms were clean. My only concern was the boarding process at CAI. Although check in and security through business class were fairly easy I found the boarding process at the gate very disorganized. Just make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get to your gate! Once onboard - piece of cake. EgyptAir offers a strong product at a good rate. I will definitely use their business class for future trips to No Africa.

### Egyptair customer review
My family flew from Toronto to Luxor (via Cairo) in business class. I was a bit concerned prior to departure after reading some of the other comments from travellers on this site. I must say I was completely satisfied with the service on the four legs of our flight. The planes are a bit old but the service was good. The staff were excellent (especially in Luxor). Everyone went the extra mile to make our flights as comfortable as possible. This is not a 5 star airline but we knew that before we departed. I think Egyptair is a solid airline and worth the cost of the tickets.

### Egyptair customer review
DXB-CAI CAI-SSH and return. MS911 DXB-CAI was on Boeing 777-300 seats are very hard and not comfortable at all flight was full red eye flight food was a tasteless omelette toilets were filthy. Crew seemed tired and not interested in their job and didn't follow safety procedures. Passengers stood up even before the plane stopped and crew didn't ask them to sit down. CAI-SSH was on express brand small E-170 45 mins flight was ok however not fond of leather seats plane was very cold return SSH-CAI was same CAI-DXB was a better flight not full over night so I slept most of it. Food was horrible entertainment was limited however with private screens on each seat but not much choices. Crew were ok however still not paying attention to safety procedures plane was taking off and the passenger behind me was talking on her phone. However price was very good. Domestic route is very expensive though.

### Egyptair customer review
Toronto - Cairo flight 996 March 21. Return flight 995 April 4. I fly them almost 3 times a year. This time the airbus 330 was a very old version direct flight of 10.5 hours almost no entertainment - only one TV for each section no phone charger so I had to give my phone to the flight attendant to charge for me. No wifi like most of the airlines. Some seats were broken. Even the crew were complaining and were apologising.

### Egyptair customer review
MS778 LHR-CAI on 2 Jan 2015. MS777 CAI-LHR 21 Jan 2105. Airbus 330-300 reasonably clean. With one or two exceptions most of the flight attendants not overly welcoming but did what was expected.

### Egyptair customer review
Amman to Cairo and Cairo to Copenhagen. By far the worst airline I have experienced the flight was delayed from Amman with no explanation given. When we finally boarded into the flight the staff did not even smile let alone make conversation with passengers. As a vegetarian I was shocked to know that they have no vegetarian options and the female attendant gave me a dry response by saying that its not their fault that I am a vegetarian. While leaving the plane all the cabin crew did was give passengers an icy stare - no smile or thank you. Its such a shame about the cabin crew because the flight was otherwise very clean modern with plenty of legroom and comfortable seats.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew London-Addis Ababa and transited in Cairo. The Lond-Cairo leg was OK the plane on the Cairo-Addis leg was pretty old and there was no in-seat entertainment system only a rolling film on shared TV sets. Neither flight back had in-seat entertainment. On the Addis-Cairo leg we got diverted to Aswan due to sandstorms at Cairo. We spent 3 hours in the plane on a taxi-way with virtually no information from the crew. I'd go as far as to say they were rude - they played cards and joked at the back of the plane whilst passenger had to buzz and ask for water. The delay resulted in a missed connection at Cairo. We were boarded on another EgyptAir flight but were given nothing in the way of food etc despite out arrival in Heathrow being delayed 10 hours in total. Lack of internet access at Cairo terminal made it very difficult to make plans for the unexpected late arrival in Heathrow (Sunday at 10pm). Having seen the poor way problems were dealt with on this flight I would not use this airline again despite the relatively low ticket cost. Aircraft were also very basic.

### Egyptair customer review
Jeddah from Manchester via Cairo. Flight was delayed by 2hrs. B737-800 aircraft was too small for this busy 5hrs flight. Very uncomfortable seating. Poor inflight entertainment. Food was very bland. Transfer at Cairo was smooth. A330-300 aircraft used for the Cairo to Jeddah section was good but food was again the same. Return journey from Medan to Manchester was just as bad. When I arrived at my allocated seat it was already taken by another passenger. Flight attendants could do with more customer care training. Cairo airport has inadequate passenger facilities. After a long transit time at Cairo airport of nearly six hours we boarded the plane to Manchester which was again Boeing 737-800. It was just as bad as our inbound flight.

### Egyptair customer review
Travelled from Cairo to Bangkok. Bad ground services. We did online check-in but sadly there was no counter available to drop our luggage. We need to queue along with others (quite a long line). We didn't get the requested seat (from online check-in) and my friend got her seat at the rear of the plane. Inflight entertainment is out- dated (compare with other airlines) with minimal choices. Uncomfortable seat because my seat cannot be reclined. Food is quite bland.

Flew London to Luxor return in August. Plane 737-800 - too small for a 5.5 hour flight. Could not follow seat allocation - travelled as a family and were split up - others complained of the same issue. Flight delayed going out by nearly 1 hour and was also delayed on return. Food reasonable. Drinks very limited and served in a flimsy white plastic cup. In flight entertainment poor - 2 films neither entertaining! No Western or classical music channel available. Because plane was small only overhead screens. On return seated at the rear of the plane and was overcome by air freshener used by the constant use of toilets. Cabin crew lacked warmth one or two didn't go out of their way with customer service. A real concern over the lack of safety procedures. Safety film shown on overhead TVs but too much going on that caused a distraction. Around me 5 seats were not in a full upright position security guard on plane used phone right up to take off & his bag sat on the seat rather than under it or in the overhead locker. Large crew bag also unsecured on landing at Heathrow. Sorry but far behind in most areas compared to other airlines.

### Egyptair customer review
Outbound trip to Johannesburg MS840 and connecting flight MS777 2nd and 3rd August 2014. The catering equipment from Johannesburg to Cairo is somewhat dated. I noticed that the food serving units are old and basically unserviceable at one point food trays fell to the floor as the door would not shut properly. The Cabin staff although trying to do their best were not cognizant of flight safety a passenger sitting on Seat 32 both in the takeoff mode and landing mode did not put his seat up to upright and although it was obvious that he was crowding the passenger behind the cabin staff made no attempt to inform the passenger that he should place his seat in the upright position. Flight from JNB to CAI: Toilets again were flooded dirty and not checked during the flight. Some of the central TV screens were inoperative and inflight entertainment was negligible. I never saw one of the flight crew smiling. The food was exactly the same menu as two weeks before. Embarking on the CAI leg to LHR confusion at G002 Gate whereby only one security portal was in operation with space between the entrance door to the actual security area was grossly too small thereby building up an uncomfortable length of time for waiting and squashed standing in that diminutive area. All announcements were first in Arabic with a fairly long narrative on each announcement. However when translated into English a 3 minute Arabic announcement finished up as about a 30 second transmission in English in any event it was very difficult to understand the crew member making announcements in English. Cairo airport has very little in assorted shops other than dozens of Duty Free stores there was not one that sold over the counter pharmaceutical medication. There was not sufficient reading or International Newspapers available. On landing there was a 35 minute wait for clearance when normal European Airlines takes less than 5 minutes. Finally luggage was not delivered to the terminal for over an hour.

Flight MS-904 DXB-HBE on A320. The flight time was accurate food was good but they have to change the way of cooking the chicken! No personal in-flight entertainment screen only over head screens.

### Egyptair customer review
JNB-CAI-JFK in August 2014. All flights on time. Egyptair requires all checked luggage from JNB to be shrink wrapped prior to check in - this is a complimentary service but becomes a bit of a free for all. Ground agents are provided by JNB are disinterested and not very organized. First segment economy on A330-200; second segment business on 777-300ER. A330 with an older interior - no IFE but seat comfort quite good as pitch was not to the latest sardine standard. Food decent and service just fine. 777-300 with pitched lie flat seats (a little worn) decent IFE and pleasant service. CAI premium lounge small and underwhelming - there appears to be a larger one under construction. CAI itself acceptable by international standards with ok shopping and restaurant options. CAI did feature somewhat confusing and frequent security arrangements/document checks - not unexpected frankly.

### Egyptair customer review
We three of us flew from LHR to LUX and return in economy. The lane used on this route currently is a 737-800 with a 3x3 seating configuration with a central aisle. The flight out left 30 minutes late but made up 20 of those in the air. The service on board was fine but the food quite poor. Landing at LUX was quite bumpy too. The return sector was again late this time by 40 minutes but what made that annoying was the flight crew turning up and walking past the waiting passengers at the gate at the time of scheduled departure rather than before as anyone would expect somewhat unprofessional. Again the flight to Heathrow was uneventful but poor food. In both sectors the cabin was almost to capacity but no-one or only a couple at most in business. The IFE is from overhead screens not seat back unless in business.

Flew Cairo to Luxor on Egyptair express EMB-170. Fantastic morning flight in business. Friendly efficient crew and great ground service from checking in to boarding. A huge breakfast on the flight with a selection of cheeses croissants toast juices and coffee. A great flight and highly recommended.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew London-Dar Es Salaam via Cairo. Boarding was shambolic and done last minute. Waited 2 hours on plane before takeoff and we had a connecting flight in Cairo with 1 and a half hours transit time so obviously late. In Cairo although many of us were late for connections still had to go through 2 security gates. Rushed into our connecting flight that was waiting for us but it didn't fly until 50 minutes later. Meals were the same on both flights and were terrible. Staff were friendly but not helpful promising to bring water tea meals (I was fasting and needed a later meal) but never delivering. Plane was newish and it's condition was good and clean but leg room was very cramped. If I can avoid it in future I will.

### Egyptair customer review
I have flown Dubai to Cairo many times on Egyptair. They operate 2 aircraft's: Boeing 777-300 and Airbus 330-300 (both are new but the airbus 330 has wifi and aero mobile services). The inflight entertainment was satisfactory meals were okay and the staff are better than before (Egyptair has improved since joining Star Alliance group). I would recommend you check the aircraft type before selecting flights on Egyptair.com.

### Egyptair customer review
Used Egyptair for a family trip round trip JFK-CAI-AMM. Flew over in business class. Returned in economy. Overall a good experience. 777-300 for JFK-CAI. Business: Business class hardware comparable to other carriers I've flown (BA Lufthansa United). Full lie flat seats. 3-4 course meal presented on elegant patterned china. Food was good. Selection of tasty fruit juices offered instead of boarding cocktails. No alcohol served on board. Not a big deal to me. Coach: A/C power at seats. Coach food OK. Wife's chicken dish was tasty curry. My beef dish was sort of attempt at stroganoff. Completely punctual on all segments. Be prepared for lots and lots of security screening on your CAI transfers. Leave time to get to your gate. Luggage delivered with no problems. IFE selection somewhat limited but still had enough choices to keep me occupied. They are in Star Alliance - watch for saver rates on award travel.

Flight MS 735 From Cairo-Istanbul on Boeing 737-800 was fine but no entertainment at all. Food was good crew wasn't bad but when I was coming back from IST-Cairo crew were bad and the entertainment was non-existent unlike other airlines. Check-in is fine. boarding was not bad.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew ASM-CAI-JFK in business class. First leg was an uneventful +2 hour flight. As scheduled departure was 4.10am not much to talk about. Service was helpful but slept most of way. The CAI-JFK was a long slog. Seats were ok in Biz class but IFE was functional but with minimal choice. Food (a breakfast and a lunch) was barely edible and more akin to the mystery meet of coach trips in the 1980's. Was astonished that EgyptAir did not serve alcohol on its planes. What particularly annoyed me was this was never noted in any part of their website. Service was sporadic and not particularly attentive. All in all I would avoid EgyptAir in the future.

### Egyptair customer review
DXB-BCN via CAI. The flights ran on time and perfectly edible meal. From Dubai to Cairo the plane had a good selection of movies and entertainment options (individual screens). The waiting area at CAI offered free WiFi as well as restaurants and seating. The plane to Barcelona was more basic and didn't have personal IFE. Even so it was a three hour journey that arrived slightly early. If you pay for a budget flight you will get a budget flight. In my case Egyptair delivered a fantastic product for the amount of money I paid and I would travel them again.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-AUH arrived at Cairo in transit from another airline so missed out on ground side check-in but the transit desk staff were extremely helpful and kind and spoke perfect English. Used the Egyptair lounge thanks to my gold status with Star Alliance but both lounges had uncomfortable chairs no good for resting or sleeping and a small selection of inedible food (small bread rolls with a slice of sweating cheese). Boarding on time at a remote stand was orderly and ramp staff relaxed about taking a few pictures of the plane a rare four-engined wide body Airbus A340-200 which had recently been reactivated after a period of storage - the cabin had obviously had a deep clean which made it very pleasant despite being somewhat old fashioned (no PTV etc). Pushed on time and flew to Abu Dhabi in a record 2h 40m. Meal was a hot breakfast consisting of a chicken sausage slice of egg omelette bread jam water juice and tea. Service was friendly and courteous. Smooth landing on Abu Dhabi's new runway and disembarked via jetway into the old but charming T1. I have previously had very poor experiences in Egyptair premium classes - terrible lounges wildly varying hard product disinterested crew every other seat occupied by friends of the captain upgraded from economy - but in economy they are actually pretty decent and when strictly on that basis will fly them again.

### Egyptair customer review
ATH-BKK-ATH via CAI. Booked with Egyptair because it was the only flight available (code share with Thai airways). The ATH-CAI-ATH legs were quite good. Helpful and pleasant crew good food good planes. CAI-BKK also adequate my seat was faulty but all in all a satisfactory flight. BKK-CAI was the worst flight experience. A very old 777 it gave you the impression it would fall apart old broken dirty seats not even a foot rest no screens not even lights working to read. It is unacceptable a StarAlliance member to use such old planes in long flights. Toilets dirty crew not helpful. I had to go and find an attendant two times to get some water. I will definitely try to avoid flying with EgyptAir in the future.

### Egyptair customer review
I traveled from London to Sharm-el-Sheikh and returned from Luxor to London along with 2 domestic flights within Egypt. London to Sharm: I arrived well before the one hour cut off and was weighing my luggage in front of the check-in counter/desks. When I finished weighing my luggage and returned to the counter they had closed the check- in and they could not accept me and declined me boarding. Told to come the next day book onto the next days flight with penalty charge of £35 for all 3 passengers. The next day I arrived 4 hours before departure. The return direct flight from Luxor to London was 5 hrs 40 minutes. Until departure time the display board stated on time no staff members to explain the delay or provide us with any information. 15 mins past the departure time the cabin crew and pilot arrived and let us board. The flight did not have any reclining seats so we had to sit for 6 hours cramped into economy class. The TV was over your head and you had to watch the movie shown. They did not even serve us a drink. Instead they started selling the inflight duty free items. Meal served after 3 hours was quite ordinary. Don't ask about the domestic flights. Overall they don't deserve to be part of the Star Alliance Group.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew BRU-CAI-BKK-CAI-BRU in business class. First sector to CAI was basic in an Airbus 321. Plane left on time and arrived on time. Food was basic and entertainment neglectable. The sectors CAI-BKK-CAI was in an 777-ER. Seat was comfortable food almost similar to BRU-CAI. After a good sleep I wake up and requested breakfast a few minutes later. However the food never made it to my seat. Entertainment was good (or satisfactory) for a night flight but having a good seat rest and sleep was more important. All together satisfied with the flight except the long transit time (5 hrs) on the return flight. The lounges in CAI are not designed to have a rest or to do some work. Wifi is basic or almost non existant.

### Egyptair customer review
Travelled to Madina from Manchester and returned from Jeddah to Manchester. Food was ok had the same meals on all 4 flights. Seating was OK but due to the small flights UK-Egypt sector very cramped. Worst staff seen on an airline. I am a frequent traveller and decided to use this airline as it was cheap. Staff shouting at passengers as if they are doing us a favour by providing drinks/meals. No entertainment at all not even small gifts/books for the children. Lavatory was devoid of basic amenities like a dry floor and toilet tissue. Seating was all over and in fact we were given 4 different areas of the aircraft to seat our 5 family members. Will never recommend.

### Egyptair customer review
JNB-CAI Feb 21. Overnight A332 flight to Cairo on somewhat beat up aircraft. Egyptair requires that your checked bags be wrapped in plastic - they provided this service at JNB free of charge but do not disclose that ahead of check-in. Boarding was on time and fine. Combination of male and female FA's. The female FA's do the majority of the service. Due to flight length I did not take the main meal. Sadly too much time was devoted to this leaving cabin lights on over 2 hours on a short 7.5 hour flight. Only served 1 glass of water until breakfast service so recommend taking on board water if not at an aisles seat. Breakfast service was disorganized. Breads and coffee primarily. Cabin was in rough shape. Approximately 20 percent of seats had to be manually adjusted by FA's. Recliner seat was ok but not ideal for overnight flight. Lavatory was dingy and Kleenex stocked for hand towels. Timing of flight makes for ideal routing between the two locations so recommend based on schedule.

### Egyptair customer review
My flight overall was a 7/10 rating. The staff were excellent the seats could be a little better and spacious but what I didn't like most of all was the inflight entertainment! I did appreciate the movies (both Arabic and American) but I didn't like the television shows and games. As for the television show just add a few more American shows to the list. In terms of the food especially the dessert it needs to taste better. Most of the time its dry.

### Egyptair customer review
Return leg MCT-CAI yet another 737. Good on-time performance with pushback minutes ahead of schedule as well as landing. The aircraft serving this route was retrofitted with better seats more legroom compared to the 737 on the previous outbound leg it also had the new fresh livery . The cabin service remains to be mediocre for the least. Catering was just normal airline food nothing to write home about. Breakfast and refreshments were handed on time. there was another run for refreshments prior to landing. Overall an improvement over my last flight with the same airline two weeks ago. Would recommend this airline for their cheap prices and on-time performance.

Flew economy Paris - Cairo - Hurghada - Cairo - Paris. Was surprised by the comfort of A330 on leg CDG-CAI-CDG. Good pitch footrest food fair and of course no alcoholic beverages but really I don't care. 3 out 4 flights were on time. One hour delay on leg CAI-CDG due to the late arrival of the plane. Something which happens all the time on all airlines. For the price paid 300 euros return CDG-CAI I really recommend Egyptair.

### Egyptair customer review
JNB-CAI-AMM I flew with Egyptair a number of times and came to the conclusion the crew ARE more interested in making sure they can sleep at night than caring for passengers. On one trip the crew moved me away from the seat that I booked towards the rear of the aircraft. During my last trip on 27 October 2013 the crew again blocked the last +-6 rows changed into their track suits and slept.

### Egyptair customer review
Having booked a holiday to Egypt with another airline this was cancelled. At a very late time we got transferred to Egyptair. As soon as we boarded at Heathrow all fears were put at ease from check in through to boarding we were treated by courteous and friendly staff. The plane was extremely clean seating was good with independent videos in the back of all seats. Once in the air we could have soft drinks / teas and coffee and the meal was very good. We flew Heathrow to Cairo then on to Luxor a week later Luxor to Cairo then on to Sharm el Sheikh 5 days later from Sharm el Sheikh to Cairo then back to Cairo and the service and quality was the same on all flights.

ATH-CAI-PEK-CAI-ATH. On all four legs reluctant fed up invisible badly trained cabin crew that simply want to get rid of you and their task to serve you. Pax reading newspaper and sleeping on the floor and not bothered by FAs. Planes that look as bad as the service you receive. Messed up cabin smelly toilets basic comfort total lack of IFE on both 10 hrs flights overlooked safety/security regulations.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-MCT. The short haul flight was operated with an ageing 737 of which MS was able to squeeze in more than 25 rows in economy! As a result very tight legroom. Seats were fitted with uncomfortable seat cushions. Service is one of the poorest. I requested a handful of tissue several times during the flight I was eventually told by one of the FAs that 'they're out of tissue'. Only one meal choice 'the second choice was not available by the time they reached our row'. This airline lacks cabin crew service proficiency. Food was good but in a very little amounts. First timer trying out this airline on this route and probably the last.

### Egyptair customer review
MS702 from Amman Jordan to Cairo with connecting flight MS995 from Cairo to Toronto Pearson. The flight attendants were extremely undutiful. The plane was very old and uncomfortable. The only thing that I somewhat enjoyed was the meal. They also had a series of relatively new movies to select from. Other than that it was a nightmare trip. The bathrooms were dirty and untended. Staff checking tickets at the gates were rude.

BRU-CAI-BKK-CAI-BRU. A320 now on the route to Brussels: that means no more personal video. Same average service as before. B777 to BKK. Had a good sleep in both directions. Egyptair seems to save some money. Amenities kit is really bad: no more balm or cream or ear plugs. Just socks and sleep mask in a tiny plastic bag. Average food. Average service. Booked them again because of the very competitive tarif the sleeping comfort on the B777 and the star alliance miles.

From London to Johannesburg and back in December! Much cheaper than any other airline over that period of time. Staff were friendly with a lovely African warmth and sense of humour. Had inflight entertainment on one of the two flights. Would definitely recommend them as you arrive just as safely for a reasonable price. We pre-booked the low fat option and it was good.

### Egyptair customer review
We flew a Heathrow-Cairo-Johannesburg return during December 2013. We normally fly either KLM or Emirates but got such a good deal due to booking well in advance (8 mths - before the political unrest) that we had to take it. We were worried about the political situation in Egypt but that did not impact on our flight at all. The flight crew were very friendly and professional in all respects. The only negative for some people may be that no alcohol is served but this did not bother us. The Cairo airport staff however was a letdown. The bathrooms were not all clean and tidy and we saw more than one official sitting under a 'no-smoking' sign and smoke.

Mumbai to Istanbul via Cairo. Flight is not up to International standards. Delay of 1 or 1.5 hrs on both ends seems normal for them. Seats are highly uncomfortable with no leg space.

Doha to Casablanca via Cairo in November. My experiences with Egyptair have always been pleasant. Nice crew good food and plenty of it good seating pitch. Both sectors were on modern A330. I have tried Royal Air Maroc to Casablanca and they were simply horrible. Egyptair is much better and I actually like transiting in Cairo Airport. Overall a good choice and their fares are always much cheaper than Qatar or Emirates.

CAI-PEK Business Nov 7th: The flight was announced on time we boarded and stayed on board around 45 min. then they told us that there is a technical problem and we would have to change the plane! We went back to the airport staff were standing at the Jetway with cold refreshments then they escorted us again to another gate with all the security procedures again. This time they offered a Hot Meal "3 Pcs of Pizza" and a soft drink" and the boarding area became in a big mess 2 hrs later they announced boarding again - a 3 hrs delay. The Flight itself was good and comfortable food was fairly good nothing special crew were friendly and helpful. PEK-CAI Business Class Nov 21: The flight was on time the Air China business class Lounge was really a joke. Again the flight was nice and comfortable and the crew were very good.

SHJ-CAI return flight. Dreadful airline. Sharjah hub airport is a mess. Ground staff is with the Cairo's one by far the rudest I have never met. There is a lounge I was supposed to get access in with my Star Alliance Gold card (as Star Alliance airlines as Egyptair currently operate flights from SHJ). Flight horrible no staff service at all and seats very cramped. Way back: same mess rude ground staff at Cairo old and tired A320 operated and nearly no staff service again with only a tiny and cold Edam sandwich served. Probably a fair airline for Africa but definitely not regarding world-wide standards. Never again.

### Egyptair customer review
Business from FRA to JNB via CAI in February 2013. Attracted by the more than fair price and it being Star Alliance we decided to give it a go. The first leg from FRA was late by about 3 hours so that all Business passengers were hauled to the waiting plane in CAI and the doors closed immediately. Eco passengers and all of the luggage was left behind. We got the baggage only 2 days later for which the lousy baggage handling of SAA is to blame. I spent several hours on the phone trying to co-ordinate baggage delivery since we had moved on. We had the older recliner seats on the way to JNB and the flat seats on the return both of which were quite comfortable the flat seats even suited me nicely being about 6"3 in height. The food was truly awful about the worst I have ever had the return being a little better when the catering came from SAA. And of course no alcohol. Upon return I tried to claim back my phone expenses only no other costs. To sum it up: If you are just looking for a relaxed way of starting your holidays and sitting Eco is a nightmare for you give it a try but really don't expect any thrills f you are willing to spend considerably more you should choose another airline.

A few days ago I flew MCT-IST via CAI - a big mistake. I can repeat the previous points of passengers: Very rude staff. The back of my seat was broken on CAI-IST leg and then again from CAI–MCT. Toilet when we boarded the plane from MCT-CAI was already filthy. Planes were old and worn-down. Flight delayed one hour with no apology. I could not eat the food on the outbound journey so I bought my own fruits and dry food on the inbound journey. The connection in Cairo Airport was worse not enough seats for the waiting passengers. Rude and aggressive Airport staff. My passport and ticket were checked 5 times sometimes a meter apart. Such a disappointment.

### Egyptair customer review
Boeing 737-800. I use a crutch to aid me in walking and I was not shown where I was supposed to go. In boarding the plane there were stairs which were hard for me to use. The buses which carried passengers from the plane to the lounge can't lower down for disabled passengers. The cabin crew were not friendly at all. They were very serious. The food served was poor. I will never use this airline again. Staff saw me struggling to carry my hand language and struggling to walk with a crutch but they continued to talk amongst themselves. Flight was from Manchester to Harare and vice versa.

### Egyptair customer review
Last November I flew with Egyptair 4 times: between Madrid and Cairo Cairo and Luxor Aswan and Cairo and finally between Cairo and Madrid. One negative point is that Egyptair cut the direct route from Cairo to Lisbon so nowadays passengers have to catch the plane in Barajas. The main flights (MAD-CAI-MAD) were regular: the route was operated by two aircraft's B737-800 which were clean and comfortable but the crews weren't polite or friendly. The food was a bit spicy like everything in Egypt. First flight was delayed about 30 minutes but the plane arrived on time to Cairo. After that flight I had to catch another one this time to Luxor. It was a stopover of about 1h30 minutes on Cairo. The flight between Cairo and Luxor also on a B737-800 was a mess because the seats mentioned on check-in that was made previously on Madrid weren't the real ones on this flight. As a result we were put on different seats on this short flight of 1 hour duration. Flight between Aswan and Cairo was on a Embraer 190 of Egyptair Express and went OK. Once again the plane was clean and comfortable but the crews were more friendly to passengers. In generally the all experience on Egyptair was regular. The airplanes were clean and comfortable the crews should be more friendly the food was a bit spicy and the entertainment was none because the planes didn't have individual screens. It was a regular experience: not very bad but not very good also.

### Egyptair customer review
Kuala Lumpur to Cairo with a technical stop in Bangkok. Very poor staff service. During boarding I said "Hi" to one female cabin crew and she looked at me with a grumpy face. I was seated in the back row. Cabin crew chatted and made noise in the galley making it difficult to get sleep during this night flight. During meal service when I asked for water cabin crew spilled water on me and didn't say sorry. No drink rounds offered during this 10 hour flight. IFE is very poor with outdated contents. Will not recommend Egyptair to anyone.

### Egyptair customer review
Last December from Athens to Kuala Lumpur via Cairo and Bangkok and return. The Athens - Cairo flight was on a 737-800 and the Cairo Kuala Lumpur was on an 777-300ER with a technical stop in Bangkok for 1.5 hours. The condition of the planes were very good and were quite new planes in all 4 flights the food was much above the average and also surprised to be served again with a full meal from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur. The only thing is that Egyptair is a dry airline (no alcohol on their flights) which is not a big problem to me. The only thing I didn't like is the waiting in Cairo to get the connection boarding pass it takes ages the Egyptair lounges were quite old with not many choices. As I am frequent flyer with many other carriers I was positively surprised and they are much better than many European carriers.

The flight was meant to take off at 14.30 we didn't start boarding until 14.25pm on 12/09/2013. When arriving in Cairo for transfers the toilets are dirty. The overnight blankets are dirty with stains. When returning on 20/09/2013 I was given a snack and had not eaten it while trying to return it with the rubbish I was requested to put it in the pocket at the back of the seat in front of me. The experience was awful. Also delayed take off as there was no bus available to take us to the plane. When arriving in Manchester we waited an hour for luggage and it was just tiresome and frustrating. Entertainment was the worst going and coming I had to watch same film. Personally I wouldn't recommend Egyptair.

TUN-CAI-JNB. It was good value for money. The most delay we got was about 15 minutes at JNB. If you are to fly Egyptair especially from JNB make sure you plastic wrap your check in bags its free and secures your luggage. Good Baggage allowance-46 kilos. What I like about Egyptair is that you don't have to stay overnight in a hotel you connect the same day. The plane toilets were clean food was excellent no alcohol though. The hostesses were very friendly and did their best. I wasn't really expecting 5 Star Emirates kind of service but it was great better than Air France. They must however improve in-flight entertainment. On the downside the Cairo airport toilets are not very clean. I will certainly fly Egyptair again.

I have travelled with Egyptair for years. The latest was 3 days ago. The carrier was 777-300 . The service was excellent. Departure was delayed 15 minutes due to late passengers. Take off was professional as well as the landing. I enjoyed the PTVs. Journey was from CAI-RUH (Riyadh-Saudi Arabia).

### Egyptair customer review
AMS-CAI-KUL. Departed on hour late but didn't mind as it cut the transit time down in CAI. 737-800 to CAI with older style seats. It is a dry airline so juice or water offered pre take off by crew who did not smile. They also give out hot towels which are so hot you can't actually touch them. No menus offered on either sector toilets not maintained on either sector. Food is well below the usual standard of most airlines but ok ex AMS only. On arrival in CAI a bus meets the aircraft and whisks Business Class away promptly and we were impressed. Once inside the terminal it was a mess. If in transit you must visit the transit check in desk which has long lines of people. We noticed there was a desk just for Business Class so went under the rope only to be yelled at by Egyptair staff. Security was a joke and did not put us at ease. Star Alliance lounge is tired and wifi not working at all. No alcohol in lounge. Toilets are disgusting. On the next sector service was just as poor with unhappy staff and no real flow to the service. Flight stops in BKK for an hour then goes on to KUL. Most people left Business in BKK but staff kept upgrading friends and family in flight which became distracting. Upgraded children running around the cabin and pushing past us. Manager was standing during take off and only just managed to strap himself in as we were climbing into the sky. The service and meals were of poor quality and reminded me of air travel 15+ years ago in Economy. They are not world class and need a lot of work to get them there.

My partner and I flew ATH-CAI on 7 August 2013 (MS748). Flight departure was supposed to be 13.30 hrs. By 13.00 hrs there was still a big empty hole at the airbridge - no indication of any flight delay. Google told me the departure time was now 14.30 hrs. At 13.30 hrs Egyptair staff informed us there was a delay and handed out vouchers for a sandwich and soft drink. At 14.30 informed departure would now be 16.30 hrs. Greatly concerned as we would miss our connecting Qatar flight to Australia in CAI. Staff offered no assistance - they only insisted we should have told them we had a connecting flight earlier. Finally departed at 16.35 hrs. A321 seating was comfortable and flight attendants were capable. Flight time to CAI was extraordinary over 30 mins ahead of schedule. We arrived too late to make our connecting flight resulting in an overnight stay in Cairo. We tried to get assistance from Egyptair in CAI and merely got shunted off to Qatar Airways. This is the first and last time I will ever fly with this airline.

### Egyptair customer review
Athens to Kuala Lumpur via Cairo - economy (25/7 return 4/8). I was a bit worried because of the political unrest in Cairo however all flights were on time without any delays. Cairo to Kuala Lumpur was on a new Airbus A330-300 (2 years old) . Service adequate once food and coffee is served don't expect the crew to appear again. If you want anything extra you can ask for it and they will be happy to provide it. Excellent value for money I would recommend it to everyone who does not want extra pampering that usually is being paid at a premium.

### Egyptair customer review
Larnaca to JFK via Cairo. Egyptair was the cheapest airline on the route and I was glad I took it. Cairo to JFK was on a new B-777 with great IFE with new films TV shows games etc. The food was quite good and generous with lots of drink rounds (Egyptair is a dry airline but that didn't bother me at all). The crew was nice and chatty. The bathrooms were kept clean throughout the flight. We were served 3 meals on the flight (dinner a hot breakfast and a hot snack). I would definitely fly them again.

### Egyptair customer review
I have flown 3 times a year with Egyptair from LHR to CAI then on the SSH and all the flights have been excellent except on the one occasion when my suitcase was not on the CAI/SSH leg. The Friday 10.30pm flight suits me and the couple of hours transit in Cairo is a small price to pay when you can arrive at SSH at 9.00am and have the whole day there. The food and drinks are fine why people especially British are expecting alcohol when it is a Muslim airline is beyond me and surely they can manage without a drink for a few hours. Price wise they often work out cheaper than Easyjet and you can take 46kg of luggage in economy without having to pay for it not to mention not having to pay for food drinks having the pleasure of IFE and flights that operate daily and at really convenient times.

### Egyptair customer review
They were the cheapest and the travel time was the shortest so we took a chance. Johannesburg SA to Cairo during June 2013. Then transferring from Cairo to Malta Island. I expected an old damaged plane with very old technology and bad service. On boarding I was surprised. It was clean comfortable and the leg space was more than I have experienced before with other airlines. When we departed from OR Tambo (22.15) the excellent service started. At 23.00 we received dinner. It was delicious. At 24.00 all dinner plates were removed. Flight was smooth and comfortable. Landed 5.55am breakfast served at 5am.

### Egyptair customer review
BRU-CAI-BKK in business class. As before the flat bed on the 777 between CAI and BKK makes it worth paying for a business class ticket. Food and service are so so but again I had a very good sleep on the night flight. On top I earned a lot of miles that I can use with any other star alliance partner.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-BCN-CAI: Check in Process was fast and effective at CAI Airport business class cabin was nice with old fashioned seats but were ok and comfortable. The entertainment was good service was great delicious Egyptian and continental food. Lots of drinks offered. On arrival At BCN Airport the Luggage took almost 45 min to start coming I noticed that this is common at BCN airport. BCN-CAI flight was a nice one excellent service and food. At least the crew were smiling and welcoming.

### Egyptair customer review
Business class on JNB-CAI in June 2013. At check-in onward boarding cards were not provided. Comment "you have to get them in Cairo". At boarding gate seat changed due to "system error" - in fact this was not correct but my good seat was provided to someone else. Onboard asked for another seat that was provided by cabin staff. Minutes later the Purser chased me away saying that seat was for the crew. Taken to seat directly in front of toilet. Blanket and pillow used amenity kit missing. No storage space for hand luggage as middle row does not have luggage compartments. Missing amenity kit was provided later. Upon arrival hand luggage of my colleague had "disappeared". Cabin crew unwilling to support but finally pushed the task to ground staff. Had to get our onward boarding cards at transit desk. Long queue (approx 30min.) for Economy but moderate waiting time at business desk. Afterwards long queue at security check for international connection flights. Actually only one X-ray machine with around 20mins waiting time. Finally only luggage was run through machine I carried my pullover jacket and mobile phone through detector but nobody reacted.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew Egyptair Express from Luxor to Cairo on Embraer. Plane was in a clean condition. Flight was smooth and the seat had a lot of leg space. Service was normal except that the flight attendants did not bother to ensure that all mobile phones were switched off and that we were belted up. When landing there were no checks by the cabin crew and the flight attendant in the front was reading newspapers. I think they should charge lesser for such a short flight and service.

### Egyptair customer review
DXB-CAI-BCN return flight booked last minute June 2012. DXB-CAI operated by a modern Airbus A330-300 however there was nearly no staff service cabin crew were rude and ignorant. Disgusting food dirty and smelly toilets on-board. No drinking water available. Chaotic assistance by ground staff at Cairo: ignorant and no English-speaking people who were even unable to tell us which was the local hour. At least I could use the Business Class lounge with my star Alliance Gold card. CAI-BCN: old tired B737-800 staff were ok onboard but awful food no alcohol served. Luggage delayed at arrival. The same happened on return: delayed flight from BCN-CAI no in-flight entertainment no alcohol available. They served twice the same meal on BCN-CAI and CAI-DXB with no choice available. Luggage delayed at DXB with no assistance whatsoever. How can these people belong to Star Alliance? Never again.

### Egyptair customer review
We flew Business Class and the service was similar to economy class. Little to no water or beverages offered for the 11 hour flight- we had to keep asking for them to fill our tiny glasses (that is right no bottles for the passengers). The service was rude and staff seemed depressed. Inflight entertainment was very poor- movies that I have never heard of and limited selection. Earphones were economy class earphones. Be forewarned Egyptair is a dry airline no alcohol. That is ok if the rest of the service was ok but it was not. The seats were fine and a small pillow and blanket were supplied.

### Egyptair customer review
23-29 April 2013 BRU-CAI-BKK-KUL KUL-BKK-CAI. Very poor service. Food not comparable to business from other airlines. No concern for safety. 777-300 ER on the long haul with flat bed that was a saving grace. Very cheap business class fare and you get what you pay for. Will not fly them again even with the cheaper fare flying was not a pleasure with Egyptair.

### Egyptair customer review
After a positive experience in economy recently I decided to fly them to China in business class due to a low fare plus the business class seat had looked very inviting when I walked past it on my previous flight. Indeed from LHR to CAI the seat was very nice although the service was very spotty just small things such as the cabin crew forgot to serve dessert to the last two rows of the cabin. Also if you serve a cup of tea with sachets of sugar perched on the saucer is it too much trouble to also include a teaspoon? I queued for ages for the forward lavatory before the milling flight attendants bothered to point out that there was also a lav aft. Basically an OK flight but with some weirdly amateurish omissions. Lounge in Cairo was a disgrace I spent most of the transit time crawling around on the floor of the "business centre" trying to get one / any of the computers to work (also wifi was broken). CAI to PEK was the long sector which I planned to make the most of the flat bed and sleep so imagine my disappointment to find that on this flight the seat was a much more old-fashioned "Lazy Boy" recliner and that after the doors closed the cabin crew upgraded all their friends which rather undermined the exclusivity of the cabin. Not worth paying for if crew use the business class cabin as a perk for their friends nor if the airline are deploying flat beds on short flights (LHR) and unsatisfying old seats on long flights (PEK). Had high hopes but totally disappointed by crew hard product and Cairo lounge. Not worth it.

Economy Class to JNB from London and return. I enjoyed the trip seats were comfortable and I had leg room which is important as I am well over 6 ft tall. Food was adequate and service good.

### Egyptair customer review
BRU-CAI-BKK-CAI-BRU. BRU-CAI-BRU on B737. CAI-BKK-CAI on B777ER. There are many airlines offering a much better business product but not at this price. Check in was smooth in BRU and in BKK transfer in CAI wasn't much of a hassle. All you need in the lounges in BRU and in BKK. Lounge in CAI is rather basic. Seating comfort on B737 was very good. I got a big seat and plenty of room. On the B777 the seat is also very comfortable and it can be converted into a slightly angled lie flat bed. On both long haul flights I had several hours of good sleep. Catering is nothing special. I got the same starter 4 times (some shrimps hidden in a lot of cocktail sauce) and the mains can best be compared to what you get in economy on some better airlines. Egyptair is a dry airline so only soft drinks and juices. Cabin staff do their job without pampering. Conclusion: it's a good deal when the comfort of the seating is more important than the dining experience. For this reason I will fly with them again.

### Egyptair customer review
LHR-ADD and ADD-LXR and LXR-LHR. Throughout the whole process from check-in (on all 6 flights) to cabin crew apart from a few exceptions the attitude of the staff was almost rude and uncaring. The security checks were inconsistent - sometimes water allowed on the flight sometimes not (even if bought in the airport) or once only if I paid the official! Food was just about acceptable but no alcohol. Film choices limited and many quite old. I would definitely not choose to use them again.

### Egyptair customer review
ATH-CAI-BAH return Business Class. Athens to Cairo B738 old and torn. Food was a cold snack tray of bad quality. No alcohol no IFE. Inattentive crew. Transfer to CAI smooth though the lounge less than average. Lack of alcohol even a descent coffee as they only serve instant. CAI-BAH EMB145 old and torn no business class seats narrow pitch. Awful food again no alcohol again inattentive crew.

### Egyptair customer review
AMM-CAI-AMM with them in economy. Both legs were on B737-800 although originally CAI-AMM we were supposed to fly an A320. Seat was ok but cabin temperature was too hot! With flight attendants it was hit and miss. The good things about MS are they operated from newer terminal 3 in Cairo and their CAI check in staff were good and presentable unlike their inflight crew. Food wise - it has gone downhill.

### Egyptair customer review
London Heathrow to Luxor. Old aircraft. Poor food. Soft drinks served in plastic beakers. Cairo to London Heathrow. New aircraft much better. Aircraft not full. Food poor. Landing at LHR the aircraft was still taxiing but passengers stood up got luggage and then stood until pilot came to a halt. No requests from pilot to remain seated and cabin crew seemed totally uninterested. Would not recommend Egyptair.

### Egyptair customer review
Took BOM-CAI-JFK. Mumbai to Cairo flight was an old aircraft without any personal entertainment system. Food was served very late though was good. When landed at Cairo airport the crew asked if I am interested to visit the pyramids and sphynx I agreed for a fare of $35. It was an excellent trip when returned were lodged in a 4 star hotel with dinner and breakfast coupons. The next flight to JFK was superb with excellent PES. Food was good but the crew did not oblige my request for water. The price was almost $200 less than other airlines. Highly recommended if you want to save money.

### Egyptair customer review
LXR-CAI-TUN A320. Domestic portion usual lack of security announcement and quick drink service. Upon landing in Cairo Security after security check from domestic to international flight - passport and boarding card check 4 times before even entering the aircraft. Worn aircraft dirty cutlery and cups (lipstick) - food bland and tasteless and the usual lack of staff attention for the remainder of the flight. I have no idea of how this airline ever made it to Star Alliance - lack of service questionable safety bad food and old aircraft.

### Egyptair customer review
LCA-CAI flight operated by Egyptair Express on Embraer145. Aircraft in bad state dirty and worn. I think only difference to Egyptair Express and Egyptair is the uniforms. This short flight was full and service was very quick - small tray meal and drinks. As soon as service is over you will not see the staff before leaving the aircraft. Although being asked to switch off electronics many passengers onboard used their tablets and mobile phones during take off and landing - staff took no notice.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-SSH A320. Extensive security upon boarding. On this flight staff actually smiled. IFE screens did not work on the entire left side so no possibility to follow security instructions. Aircraft seemed clean but old and warn. Drinks offered very quick and then no sight of staff until you disembark. Many passengers onboard used their tablets and mobile phones during take off and landing - staff took no notice.

### Egyptair customer review
BRU-CAI-BKK in business class. After reading many complaints about Egyptair in previous years the negative comments changed to positive last year because Egyptair changed the type of plane to the 777-300ER. After a lot of hesitation I booked finally a ticket in business class for the above said trip. The flight BRU-CAI was a smaller jet so you cannot expect too much. Food and service were acceptable. The 2nd sector went from CAI to BKK (night flight). Food service and attitude from the staff was similar to other carriers while the flight entertainment was good but not super. The seats can "almost" be considered as a flat bed so a good rest is almost guaranteed. The lounges in CAI are very average where no alcohol will be served (neither during the flights) however if you buy your beer or wine in the food court you can drink it in the lounge. Overall satisfied and good value for the money.

### Egyptair customer review
Well Egyptair have come a long way since 2010 when my wife and I last used there poor service. We had a total of 10 flights this time around all internal flights. Modern aircraft all very comfortable and the service for once was friendly. No meals served as all fights were of about one hour duration around the country but you do get a cup of water or juice. All fights left on time and check in had no problems. After last time (2010) I was hesitant to fly Egyptair but I had no choice since it is the only internal air service in Egypt at the time. In short things have improved and I think after 10 flights over three weeks if they had not I would have noticed. I will not hesitate to fly with them again but international fights that's another question.

### Egyptair customer review
Istanbul - Cairo one way. Plane was changed from Boeing 737-800 to Airbus 320. Being a Star Alliance member and the higher ticket price to fly with them I expected that there would be inflight entertainment. I was wrong there was none at all. The seat that I got was near the emergency exit. While it has more leg room than the other seats the cushion was damaged. The window was a little bit dirty. Flight attendants and the food were okay.

### Egyptair customer review
Luxor to Cairo (return) didn't expect a drink or anything for this one hour flight so quite surprising to receive one! Cabin Crew on both flights were pleasant and although the safety routine was quite bizarre and sort of rushed all safety cards were up to date and in place. The return flight was the Express version of Egyptair and to be honest I couldn't tell the difference as service and friendliness was just as good. Both modern and clean aircraft utilised.

### Egyptair customer review
My wife has walking difficulties and requires wheelchair assistance. Shortly before arrival at Cairo my wife advised the cabin attendant and was told to wait on the plane for a lift. After waiting some time we along with two other people were told the lift had come and gone. The crew told us it had been recalled and would arrive shortly. It turned up about an hour later. It then went to another flight before depositing us at the terminal some ž hours after arrival. At this point we should have been met by our tour representative who would have our visas. We found out the visas had been purchased for all our group of 39 but could not find the representative. After some time we purchased new visas and the wheelchair attendant set off at high speed for the plane which had been considerably delayed. On the return the arrangements for a chair worked well at Aswan and the lift was there at Cairo but it deposited us in the terminal at the bottom of several flights of stairs and no assistance. The casual and inefficient attitude to handicapped passengers means we shall never travel Egyptair again.

### Egyptair customer review
AMS-CAI-JNB. AMS-CAI seats are nice and comfy old style of screens flipdown from bulkhead. Menu choice for BUS poor. Two options (chicken or fish) only and we were the 2nd row after us only fish was available! Priority disembarking in CAI very nice despite very dilapidated bus. CAI lounge not that impressive food offering average. Seat on CAI-JNB the old cradle type not even lie flat! Very surprised to see sleeper suits in the amenity bags handed out! Service very rushed and then the staff disappear completely until they rush you through breakfast again. Again food offering is very average. Egypt Air is a cheaper option for a business class flight and it really has no frills.

### Egyptair customer review
FRA-CAI-BKK. Food good on both legs. Staff friendly although not active except at meal times. However if the passenger actively sought liquids these were available. New Boeing with lie flat seats CAI-BKK is very good I even got some sleep. Price excellent. Longer (4 hour) stopover in lounge which was acceptable (although dry except for beer). Good choice of older films on in flight entertainment system. Only critic is boarding: In Cairo no priority boarding or security. In Frankfurt chaos. Priority boarding called. Staff allowed a scrum to develop with business passengers really having to fight their way through economy passengers who resented letting anybody through and who attempted to hinder this physically. This is something which could really be handled better.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-JHB. Air stewards were polite but the air hostesses were sullen and miserable. I rang the bell to ask for some tea at 2am and the air hostess came to me and said "What!". On this flight there was no inflight entertainment whatsoever and we were offered beverages from a two litre bottle only at the start of the flight and that was all. I am used to being offered a can of cool drink or a hot drink throughout an international flight. Won't fly Egyptair again!

### Egyptair customer review
JFK-CAI-JNB-CAI-JFK. First 3 legs were comfortable lie back seats are a treat food was plentiful and palatable and as long as one gets a bottle of water at the beginning of the flight the absence of cabin service isn't a problem. Inflight entertainment doesn't offer a lot of choice but the screens are large. However there seems to be a blatant disregard for health and safety. On the last leg there was a large family with 5 badly behaved kids disturbing other passengers and interfering with cabin service throughout the entire trip. It's a wonder there wasn't a hot beverage incident. One child was still running around while the flight was landing on the tarmac! It was one of the worst inflight experiences I have had and the reason I have rated trip satisfaction as fair only.

Dec 21 CAI-LXR on A321. Flight scheduled to depart at 5.30am but left at 5.50am - not sure why as there was no other traffic around us. Flight was 50 minutes - flight attendants were friendly and provided snacks and a drink. Smooth landing and bus to terminal in Luxor. Dec 24 LXR-CAI on 737-800. Flight was listed to leave at 10.30pm on our reservation but at the airport it showed at 10.15pm departure. 40 people on the plane - so you could spread out. Seats were very comfortable. Drinks provided with a smile. I had always heard Egyptair was awful but I'd fly them again. Their business class seats on the 737 looked great.

Flew ATH-CAI-KUL (via BKK) and back. Service was good plane for ATH-CAI-ATH was 737-800. The long leg CAI-KUL via BKK is on a new 777-300ER with PTV. Meals were good planes clean price for ticket very competitive and all flights on time. Flight attendants were helpful. I will fly with them again in the future.

### Egyptair customer review
Short haul flight from Cairo - Hurghada / Hurghada - Cairo. Check in ok. Security checks poor. Small Embrarer plane. Flight down was uneventful except for flight attendant standing for landing at the back eating a bag of potato chips. Return flight we requested last row seats at the back again but was told they were for staff. We were seated in the 2nd last rows. After door was closed flight attendant closed both back seat window shades and preceded to have a sleep! Stayed asleep until other flight attendant was half way down the cabin serving drinks. No second checks for landing no cups collected. No concerns for passenger safety whatsoever.

### Egyptair customer review
BUD-CAI in Business. MS operates the BUD-CAI leg on EgyptAir Express planes. Poor service in business class. Same meal like in Economy. Unfriendly flight attendants. Never saw them again after first meal and drink service. No inflight entertainment. Although priority tag on my bags my luggage was one of the last pieces after arrival.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew direct from JFK to Cairo. We were expecting the worst and were pleasantly surprised. Flight to Cairo was on a new plane with individual TV monitors. The flight was half full. Staff were attentive. The return flight was full because of hurricane Sandy. Still new airplane and attentive staff. I have certainly flown a lot worse and would not hesitate to fly them again.

### Egyptair customer review
Planes were old shabby fixtures broken service was surly boarding process chaotic luggage delayed. In flight entertainment very limited. I was moved from my business class seat to a smaller bulkhead location because it was a long flight and the crew wanted to use the seat. This itinerary was a Star Alliance reward redemption therefore unable to comment on value. The same itinerary included flights with Air Canada Lufthansa and South African Airlines - who were stellar in every category.

### Egyptair customer review
Cairo-Sharm el Sheik. The flight itself was absolutely fine with very pleasant staff etc. What was really shocking was when we landed our baggage wasn't there and we subsequently found out that when the plane is too heavy they leave some of the bags in Cairo to go on the next plane! Three families (incl us) had no bags. We then had to go to the hotel and then later return via taxi to the airport to collect our bags from a later flight! When I was leaving the plane I noticed that some passengers hand luggage that was too big for the overhead lockers had been put on some spare business class seats. All this apparently is standard procedure on Egyptair. I won't be using them again.

### Egyptair customer review
AMS to Johannesburg via Cairo. Helpful check in good onboard service. On time departures for both flights. Easy transfer at Cairo. Good fare. Let down by an old plane from Cairo to Johannesburg where toilets were smelly some toilet doors wouldn't close properly and water not working from some taps. The seats have been used for so long that the covering on the foot rests have been completely worn down to the metal. As I have said before it really depends on whether you get a new or old plane as to the overall experience from Egyptair. Recommended only if you are prepared for this possibility.

### Egyptair customer review
LHR-CAI-AMM and JED-CAI-LHR. All flights on time with clean modern and comfortable aircraft. Wasn't expecting much from CAI as a transfer point but was very simple on the way out. Return was more hassle as we were bussed to another terminal for arrivals which didn't have a transfer point and then bussed again to the main terminal. Friendly crew all round and tasty if uncomplicated food. An excellent price for this business class trip. Will definitely consider Egyptair in future if schedules and price are right. Overall a good impression from my first flights with them.

### Egyptair customer review
Had to fly back to UK quickly. Good comfortable seats with foot rest and 10" IFE screen. Service and food were fine although no alcohol served. Only observation I would make is that flight attendants do not give proper consideration to passenger safety as we were coming down to land at LHR one passenger continued to sleep across two seats reclined arm rest up and seat belt not secured. She was passed at least twice by cabin staff who took no notice and the plane landed with the passenger still in this position. This was Cairo to LHR flight on 11th Oct 2012.

### Egyptair customer review
The aircraft was comfortable and clean and the seats gave generous leg room. The cabin crew were very pleasant and courteous and the flights were punctual. The food served on the flight from Cairo to London was however inedible. I had beef and my wife had chicken and both meals had completely dried up. They had obviously been kept hot for far too long. The food on the outbound flight was slightly better but was still far below the quality I have experienced on other airlines. I make these comments to be helpful as other aspects of the flights were excellent.

### Egyptair customer review
Johannesburg to Heathrow via Cairo - economy 11/12 October. Both flights arrived early and both were new planes. Checking in and transfer easy. Service on board excellent good food helpful staff and comfortable seats with excellent entertainment system. And a good fare as well. If you get Egyptair's new planes then you really can't go wrong. I have used them a few times in the past and this was by far the best experience.

### Egyptair customer review
LHR-CAI-SSH. Rude staff poor food no alcohol - only warm flat soft drinks served from 2 litre bottles. On the return journey the plane was overbooked resulting in not being able to sit together despite booking and reserving seats and one poor woman had to have her child on her lap for the whole flight despite having paid for a seat! Add to this they left our luggage in Cairo and we had to wait a day and a half to get it. We will never fly this outfit again.

### Egyptair customer review
IST-CAI-BKK-CA-IST. There is a big difference with Egyptair on their new 777 aircraft and the old 737's. So IST to CAI was a complete mess people with so much baggage in their laps arguments over taking over people's seats and the check in process was insanity personified. Instead of sending everyone away to re- pack their bags they make you wait as people do it at the check in desk. And you wait and then you wait some more because every other person on these flights into CAI is carrying way too much baggage and trying to sneak it in. I was dreading the 777 to BKK but lo and behold it's like a different airline! Modern clean and bright plane crew in complete control of the cabin. Amazing difference. Same on the return. Not sure I would do it again on MS flights although my time in the three cities was great.

Flew the JFK-CAI-JFK and thought it was fantastic. flight was on time. 2 hot meals and a pre-arrival snack drinks available the whole flight. The entertainment system was quite nice but needs to be updated.

### Egyptair customer review
Economy flights AMS to JNB via CAI - 2 Sept. On time flights in both cases. Helpful staff at check in at AMS and on board. Food on first flight poor on JNB flight excellent and special meal provided. Easy transfer at Cairo. Both old planes with one toilet not working on AMS-CAI flight. Noticed no problems with the JNB plane - just looking worn with overhead entertainment only. Staff on both flights helpful and pleasant. Provided you are willing to accept an old plane should that be your lot then I will recommend this time because Egyptair works in other ways - good fares with pleasant and helpful staff.

LOS-CAI-JFK. Best value for money based on short notice but required 12-hour layover in Cairo. Egyptair gave me a meal and hotel voucher as standard procedure! Flight from LOS was uneventful but decent; 737-800. The flight from Cairo to JFK - new 777-300ER. I requested a last minute upgrade to their Business/First and got it for $595 USD. A steal for a 12-hour flight! Excellent service and comfortable business class full-sleeper seats.

### Egyptair customer review
CMN-CAI. Check in was organized fast track security was very fast lounge is average boarding was organized took off on time. Seat was very poor for a business class seat the food was horrible. My screen was not working I changed to 3 seats and finally on the third seat it was working the screen is very small the crew disappeared after meal service. Overall a bad flight.

### Egyptair customer review
Johannesburg to London via Cairo - 20/21 August. Good fare check-in simple easy transfer at Cairo staff helpful and pleasant with special meal as ordered and ok. Egyptair is an airline of two halves depending on whether you get a new or old plane. Plane to London was new - 777 - with excellent seats and entertainment system - didn't feel cramped although completely full. Plane from JOburg to Cairo old and it showed. Parts in the toilets were kept together by duct tape and cable ties the overhead screens were not all working and entertainment offered dire. Also just as plane was taxing one of the toilets overflowed and it ran back through the plane during take off. Fortunately it was clean water staff mopped it up purser came to apologise and those affected could move. So handled well but until Egyptair replaces those planes and the experience is hit and miss I can't recommend despite so many other positives.

### Egyptair customer review
Istanbul (Ataturk) to Cairo coach. The plane was modern and comfortable and relatively spacious. The meal was bad but edible. Dry airline so if you like a drink in-air plan accordingly. A fight of some sort broke out in the rear of the plane which flight attendants managed to resolve reasonably quickly. Departure wasn't too late and arrival was ahead of schedule.

### Egyptair customer review
AMS-CAI-BKK-KUL. Everything on time clean and new aircraft's good attentive service good food (a letdown during CAI-BKK). It is just as good as many other airlines. I am not a drinker so a no-alcohol policy was a extra treat for me.

### Egyptair customer review
DXB-CAI-LHR after completing 3 flights with MS in the last month I can definitively say it's the worst international carrier I've had the displeasure of travelling on. MS fail to provide a fair level of service for its premium passengers no priority boarding food comparable to CX economy and tardy slow service from the crew. MS provide lie-flat seats on its long haul fleet found it difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep.

### Egyptair customer review
Our family of 5 recently travelled from JNB to Cairo and then to JFK. As this was the first time any of us had flown Egyptair we were pleasantly surprised. The food was good - our only complaint was that we didn't have enough to drink (i.e. water or cold drinks). We had a 12 hour stop over in Cairo on our return flight and we were given a voucher for 2 x rooms in a hotel close to the airport plus a lunch voucher. We were able to face the Cairo-JNB leg of the trip after a shower and a nap.

### Egyptair customer review
After reading some reviews we were worried about flying with this airline but as we were travelling from Cairo to Johannesburg we didn't have a choice. Given that we had low expectations we were pleasantly surprised with the overall experience. It wasn't up to scratch service wise as with other airlines we have flown but it was ok for the 8 hour flight. Meals are a little below par but edible. Drinks seem to only be offered at meal times so I suggest taking some on the plane with you. Inflight entertainment is via central screens around the aircraft - bring a book/laptop/ipod to keep you entertained as it is pretty average. If you have another choice of airline for a similar price then take that one. If you don't - just don't have high expectations and you will be ok. 8 hours was bearable but I wouldn't fly with them on a flight of any longer duration.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-LCA-CAI. April 24th. The flight to Larnaca Cyprus was short and comfortable the plane was E70 seats were comfortable and the snack was surprisingly very good. We were on time for both inbound and outbound flights. Ground handling at both airports was excellent.

### Egyptair customer review
LHR-SSH. Flights were on time and service was good. The staff were very friendly when you were being served but slow to help people when not on trolley service. Cabin comfort could be improved the seats were quite old and bulky. Entertainment was limited to overhead monitors which isn't great for a 5 hour flight. Food was good on the way out but bland on the way back the also ran out of the chicken option before halfway down the cabin. Would recommend but would be good to see improvements.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew EgyptAir from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Cairo. Two older planes - standard aisle monitors on the AMS- CAI leg but at least had personal monitors in the headrest on the leg from Cairo to Bangkok with +1 for each chair having USB plug for charging on that last longer leg. Food was average but hot service a bit abrupt. Hard to get attendants' attention for something like a drink - best to bring bottled water. On the return pretty much the same. As a stopover point Cairo has poor food choices rude people not enough seating 2-min wifi leases? Frustrating.

### Egyptair customer review
Mumbai to New York via Cairo and returned by the same route. Cairo to New York aircraft was good with in flight entertainment. Food was okay so were the flight attendants. Egyptair gave a hotel room at Cairo both during onward and return journey. Overall it was a very good experience.

### Egyptair customer review
Travelled LHR-LXR return. Checking in each way was simple and efficient. Flights took off on time both ways. Found the seats to be comfortable with sufficient legroom for my husband who is tall. My fish meal which was salmon on the outward journey was the best I have ever had on a flight. On the return journey I had ordered a vegetarian meal regretting this the flight attendant exchanged her salmon meal for mine. My husbands meal both ways was also good. Overall I think the inflight service was admirable all attendants were pleasant and helpful.

### Egyptair customer review
My family and I used Egyptair from Cairo to New York. As it was a long flight it was a real nightmare. After 5 hours the toilets were very dirty and the cabin crew did not want to clean them. We have a 3 year old son and there was no available entertainment for him at all. The food was very poor. We have used Egyptair a lot for short flights as we used to live in Egypt they were not bad at all. But after our experience we will never use them for a long flight again.

### Egyptair customer review
LHR–CAI. Flight left 90 minutes late due to usual Heathrow congestion. They could have let us stay in the lounge rather than board a poorly ventilated plane for this time. Plane was filthy and clearly had not been cleaned in LHR (or possibly for some time). There were stains splattered across the seat next to me and trash piling up at the back of the plane in the attendants’ area near the toilets. Clearly no-one cares about the aircraft cleanliness. I was surprised that IFE was available on a relatively short (4+hr) flight with a limited choice of western movies and many more Arabic ones. No alcohol was served (not even for purchase).

### Egyptair customer review
LHR-LXR return on A320. Full outbound almost so on return. Leg room ok food average. Cabin crew friendly.

### Egyptair customer review
LHR to Cairo on a 777 (3-3-3) and back on a 737-800. I was puzzled during outbound online check-in to see a large block of seats towards the rear blocked off. I selected the 2 aisle seats in the middle block of 3 towards the rear and it paid off - the two of us shared 3 seats. The rear area was filled with uniformed (but not working) crew each of whom was given three seats to spread out on. 777 seat back screens were a reasonable size but there was little I wanted to watch. 737 just had those museum piece descending screens showing something very washed out. 737 was pretty full in economy however we got 3 seats for the two of us again. Both ways the food was not that good no alcohol rather lackadaisical staff (eg at one stage they sat in the galley chatting). Both ways we were rather made to feel like third class passengers.

### Egyptair customer review
Paris-Cairo: Airbus 300 configuration 2-4-2. Personal IFE offers excellent choice of video games good choice of movies. Meal was very good. Seats ok footrest is a real plus. Twice my IFE stopped working (problem with touching screen) and in 5 minutes crew updated it. Some passengers got pillow + cover some other didn't. No alcohol served onboard.

### Egyptair customer review
Heathrow–Sharm el Sheikh Economy Class. Overnight flight in a full A320 economy cabin. Tried to check-in online without success nevertheless check-in was quick and efficiently. Flight on time. Cabin was very hot - it was not a comfortable flight. No personal IFE small screens – one for every third or fourth row these were difficult to view and with the cabin noise difficult to hear. Reasonable hot meal served shortly after departure and beverages shortly before arrival. Cabin crew were efficient. Sharm el Sheikh–Cairo–Heathrow Economy Class. Again unable to check-in online. Short 45 mins flight to Cairo on half full A320. Beverage service only. Cairo–Heathrow on 777 in exit row seat. Reasonable hot meal served and personal IFE adequate for the short 4.5 hour journey. Again I found the cabin crew friendly and helpful.

### Egyptair customer review
Excellent flights LHR-CAI-LHR on 777-300. All on time economy legroom best I've ever had. IFE individual screen fully functional with good selection although not as extensive as some. Food - very tasty both ways. Only downside is FA's seem a bit disinterested but never ignored passengers.

### Egyptair customer review
RUH-CAI-IST and IST-CAI and CAI-RUH. An overnight flight was turned into a nightmare with lights on fully at all times a random stop at the wrong airport followed by a 6 hour delay from 3am to 9am in Cairo. A 6 hour journey was turned into a 12 hour stressful experience with no sleep possible and no clear information given. On arrival at Cairo we were bussed to the airport terminal and made to stand in a locked bus in the dark outside the airport. Really disappointing lack of service information. Food was good and pleasant.

### Egyptair customer review
AMS-CAI-JNB return in Business class. All flights on time lounges in AMS and JNB are contracted but okay. Priority boarding only in AMS. Service was okay however do not expect LH/LX/SA C-Class standard. IFE is poor. Food okay-no alcohol served. No lie-flat seats on the long-haul as 330-200 equipment but overall comfortable seating. Good value for a very competitive price on a C-Class Ticket.

### Egyptair customer review
We flew from NY to Cairo return. Check-in and baggage security went smoothly. We flew business class and our seats on Boeing 777 were very comfortable. My primary complaint involves the food and the indifferent attitude of the crew. Breakfast and lunch were lousy and staff congregated in the galleys and aisles laughing and joking with each other the entire flight. When the seat belt lights went on they were oblivious to the warning and did not care if passengers were buckled in or not. Finally the movie selection was outdated.

### Egyptair customer review
DAR-CAI-CPH. Upgraded to lounge access in Dar. Aircraft's were new clean Boeing 737 2x3 rows configuration. Seafood meal was of high quality. FAs very attentive and efficient. IFE not of priority but worked though without options. Cheap ticket. All flights punctual.

### Egyptair customer review
Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur via Cairo. The 777-300 from Cairo to Kuala Lumpur return is excellent in terms of comfort. AVOD personal TVs excellent leg room. The downside is the meals and service. 3 meal services from Cairo-Bangkok-Kuala Lumpur and all the same offering. The staff do a bare minimum of service. No extra drinks offered during the night. Poor cabin crew let the whole experience down.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-BOM in Economy and have to say flying a B737-800 on an almost 6hr overnight flight would have been extremely uncomfortable if it was not for the fact that I managed to get 3 seats to myself so I laid across and managed to get about 3-4hrs sleep. The IFE was ancient with only overhead monitors the food was horrible and the staff surly and did not seem to want to be there.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew from Sharm El Sheikh to CAI on Em-170 and CAI to CAN on 777-300 in Business Class. Both flights were on time and departed with no problems. First flight was full second flight about 60% full. Only 5 of the 49 business class seats occupied. From CAI to CAN it was overnight flight so I did not eat. Slept for 6.5 hrs in the flat bed seats very comfortable. Breakfast was basic everything served at once on a tray. Very happy with the trip and the price.

### Egyptair customer review
CPH-CAI-NBO. Egypt Air use smaller aircrafts (AB320 and Boeing 737) for these long distance flights which makes it a bumpy road. Aircraft's clean well maintained. Special meals accommodated and delivered to perfection. Food good FAs appeared attentive and efficient. No alcohol but staff accepts consuming own drinks you may bring onboard. IFE very poor. Seats roomy and acceptable. Arrival in NBO in the middle of night may seem inconvenient but allow very fast airport to town transfer due to no traffic jams hardly any traffic at all. Cheap tickets. Fast credit of mileage. All flights punctual.

### Egyptair customer review
GVA-CAI-BKK v.v. New 777-300ER on the long-haul - a real improvement. Very comfortable lie-flat seats in business fairly good IFE system a big step forward. Staff service seems to be improving too. On the way back it seemed like a number of business class seats were occupied by MS staff. Food - main course tasty while the first course seemed to be the same on every flight. They tried to give priority boarding for business passengers in Geneva airport but not well organized. Transfer at CAI airport the same as usual passing by the transfer desk even if already holding a boarding pass for the onward flight. Lounge ok flights on time. GVA-CAI-leg served by 737 as usual with still fairly good business class seating (2-2-configuration). All over not bad for the money paid.

### Egyptair customer review
Luxor-Cairo return. A tale of two airlines. Outbound very old 737 seats falling apart and unpleasant crew. Service consisted of a carton of undrinkable liquid with no other choice. Return was a different story. Brand new plane professional and friendly crew and choice of drink from the bar.

### Egyptair customer review
Brussels - Cairo - Dar Es Salaam in economy. Small and older aircraft on first leg completely full. Older seats standard interior nothing special. Newspapers in French English and Arabic. Food was ok. Leg space ok. For the price nothing to complain. Second leg also small to medium aircraft with same interior and same service. No problems at all no fancy things either.

### Egyptair customer review
Rome to Addis Ababa flight was delayed about 10 hrs in Rome and they did not give any information. Finally we reached Cairo by the time our connecting flight had left. We are forced to wait for next flight but the staff in the airport did not care - with a great force we were kept in hotel for a day then they asked to vacate the hotel without the confirmation of the flight. We were in the airport from 1100 pm to the next days flight at midnight - almost 24hrs in airport without any facilities. It was their mistake and it is a great punishment to the passengers.

### Egyptair customer review
Economy LHR-SSH-LHR. Check-in smooth and efficient with no significant delays. Both flights departed within 10 mins of the scheduled time and both arrived early at destination. Meals were acceptable but not outstanding. Regular non-alcoholic refreshment was served. Inflight entertainment was available but unexciting. No cause for any significant complaint.

### Egyptair customer review
Travelled to Entebbe via Cairo return. 3 of my 4 trips delayed by at least 90 mins to 2 hrs. The excuse on the first occasion was that we were waiting for a First Class passenger. One of my bags delayed for 2 days when I arrived in Entebbe. I also booked a vegetarian meal no problem here but all 4 hot meals were the same rice and grilled vegetables. The service on the flights staff and transfer through Cairo were fine. But generally the planes particularly on the Entebbe legs were cramped and poor quality compared to others on that route.

### Egyptair customer review
I have flown Egyptair several times since my family moved for work 2 yrs ago I am constantly pleased with the service and overall ease at which staff provide good customer service. I recently returned to London and unfortunately mid flight suffered sickness rather badly. I was treated with respect and dignity and at no time felt a nuisance. I appreciate the service given.

### Egyptair customer review
As a disabled passenger they could not have been more helpful and the flight from Heathrow to Cairo was excellent. Food and cabin staff good the only downside was the rather definite landing we had. Flight by Airbus from Cairo to Alexandria again had lovely cabin staff and refreshments served twice during 40 min flight. Airport staff at Cairo and Alex also friendly and helpful which makes a change.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-IST. Flight departed on time. Clean and friendly crew. Food was of a good quality the only sad point is there was no entertainment program.

JFK-Cairo. Not a horrible flight but the restrooms were not cleaned in 10 hrs. The cabin was hot and the seat didn't have the air adjustment option. Flight crew seemed lazy and unfriendly. Never came around with water I had to ask no rubbish collection.

### Egyptair customer review
London Heathrow to Baghdad with a 4 hour layover in Cairo. I was surprised by the quality I was expecting terrible service and an out of date plane however I had an good check-in experience and the flight itself on one of Egyptair's newer Boeing 777-300 planes was excellent. While IFE did not have the range of programs that some airlines offer it offered far more of a range than some. The food was good enough service was easily available and the cabin crew polite and helpful. The only drawback was no alcohol available. The flight to Baghdad left early and was more than half empty so there was plenty of room to stretch out.

### Egyptair customer review
Good staff the lack of alcohol contributed to a pleasant flight. Airbuses were a bit tired but the new Boeing 737-800 was comfortable. Great value nice service and only slightly delayed.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-BRU with an old A321 (10 Business seats). Business class might have been acceptable 20 yrs ago but now it's a real disgrace. Out of date Business Class no personal screen no pillow no amenity bag two French newspapers no English ones. Flight attendants tried to make the flight as comfortable as possible.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-CPH. Flight was on time the Aircraft was a new 737-800. Economy class the service was very good the staff patient considering the number of school students onboard. FA's tried patiently to control them and keep them seated. BER CAI. Station Manager was extremely friendly to everybody. Flew Business class the flight was on time seats were old fashioned but comfortable and functional Video & Audio programs were excellent food was good quality and FA's nice and interacting with passengers.

### Egyptair customer review
FRA-CAI. Check-in was very unorganized waited 1 hr to be checked in. Lounge was nice but very crowded. They don't have Priority Boarding for Business Class passengers. The seat was very uncomfortable considering it was a business class seat - it doesnt become lie flat. There was PTV's but they were blurry and the control panel wasn't working and not very many choice of movies. The food was horrible - cold. The flight attendants hang out in the galley.

### Egyptair customer review
Flight from Cairo to Beijing. Old Business Class the seats were not comfortable at all. The legroom was like in Economy. The First Class cabin also seemed to offer less comfort than Business normally does. Food was ok. The only advantage is the good value for money.

### Egyptair customer review
On my way to New York I had a stopover in Cairo. Ground staff were as polite and helpful as were the inflight staff. Confirmation that this hadn't just been my lucky day I had the same experience on my way back. My only moan was the music. If they could add a little bit of some laid back jazz.

### Egyptair customer review
DUR-JHB-CAI. BEY-CAI-JHB-DUR. Excellent comfort and great value for money. Seats were wide plenty if legroom and good footrest. No PTV was a large drawback though but I sleep though out the whole flight. A great airline and will use them again.

### Egyptair customer review

### Egyptair customer review
Flew BKK-CAI-LHR return. Had new planes on all legs except last flight CAI-BKK. Flights were all more or less on time cabin crew were friendly enough food was mostly good. Older plane on last leg had no personal IFE but as it was a night flight we tried to sleep anyway the food was not as good out of Cairo. The new planes were very nice the toilets were large and very clean and the seats were comfortable. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and would fly with Eygptair again if the price was right.

### Egyptair customer review
AMS-CAI Business Class. A321 with old business class seats but still comfortable. Service excellent food plentiful and tasty. All flights on time boarding in an organised manner.

### Egyptair customer review
Never again! Onboard Staff not very friendly or helpful in general but that was not the half of it. When arriving at Johannesburg to check in for our return flight to London we were informed our flight had been cancelled and that the Friday flights had been non operational for months. Not once were we informed of this and when complaining were told they had sent us an e-mail a week prior to return departure! We were on holiday and in the African bush - unlikely to check e-mails on a daily basis! No one apologised nor accepted responsibility for mistake and refused to try help us get home on time. Does Star Alliance not mean anything?

### Egyptair customer review
I flew 4 Egypt Air flights during my holidays to Egypt and Jordan. Most of the flights were about an hour long with the longest being the flight from Jordan to Cairo. All the planes were new and food supplied looked decent. I had more of an issue with the passengers rather than the staff. Middle Eastern passengers tend to want to sit wherever they want so it is possible that someone will be sitting in your seat and the flight attendants will have to shuffle folks around so you can sit where you were supposed to. Middle Eastern male passengers tended to treat the female flight attendants with disdain and it took the male attendants to get everyone organised. Egyptair doesn't really follow restrictions for carry on luggage so unless you get on early it is possible there will be nowhere to put your things except under your seat or way behind or in front of you.

### Egyptair customer review
The worst service ever. I'm waiting for my refund (because of their cancellation) for more than 2 months now. It's really difficult - when I try to call them it takes more than 1 hour just to get connected or connected at all. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.

### Egyptair customer review
Cairo to London economy codeshare with BMI. Not allowed to take airport bought water on board. Sat near the back of an older A321 and whole area had a terrible smell of urine. Seats very uncomfortable. Only 2 drinks served (very small cups of 7-up) during whole flight. Food disgusting and cabin staff not at all interested. No information at all from the flightdeck.

### Egyptair customer review
DAR-CAI-FRA-CPH. Small aircraft good service no alcohol. Check-in in Dar pleasant though complained could not check in my luggage beyond Copenhagen though with another Star Alliance airline. However the airline granted me an untitled free lounge access in Dar instead which was a fair deal. DAR-CAI on time food served fast. The flight is only 4 hours at night. Thus it was pleasant to see 2 sandwiches were instantly handed out upon departure as dinner and then very shortly after came the breakfast. That rendered the options to sleep onboard to half an hour before descent or – to be waken up and have the breakfast in the middle of the night. Special meals taken care of. Missed my LH flight to Copenhagen as they had only granted 50 minutes. Was rebooked to a flight within 2 hours later. Arrived in CPH but had to go out of transit to capture my luggage for onward flights.

### Egyptair customer review
DXB-CAI-LHR as part of a reward ticket in Business Class. DXB excellent shared lounge with a few snacks a few drinks and internet. Having read the reviews made sure I had some cereal fruit and yoghurt at 4am before the flight and liberated a can of lager for lunch on the CAI-LHR sector. A substantial breakfast served very tasty and one of the best airline meals I have had. Music choice poor but good range of films seats comfortable and stretched out fully. Landed in Cairo about 20 mins late and what seemed a long way to the transfer desk. Here there was chaos no real lines people pushing in claiming leaving flights and although there was a Business Class desk this was dealing with what appeared to be everybody. Given an invite to the lounge after being asked if I wanted a smoking or non smoking lounge. I had intended to have a shower but lounge was busy and the flight being late and chaos at the transfer desk meant that there was only 45 mins there. Inflight entertainment was same as previous sector which was fine as I finished watched the film I fell asleep. Unnecessary stale cheese sandwich offered shortly after take off as well as great amenity kit. I have to say contents better than LH and LX business class kits - more useful contents. Fantastic lunch offering served 2 hours before landing at Heathrow with amazing in flight service. Landed on time and bags on carousel before me which is almost unheard of at LHR T3. Overall very good service comfortable aircraft especially B777 from CAI to LHR. The only thing that let it down was the transfer process at DXB and CAI.

### Egyptair customer review
CPH-CAI-DAR return. Tickets heavily discounted good value. Check in with automats in CPH airport waste of time as boarding cards and luggage tags are only provided. Special food good 2 options for hot meal given on all routes for other passengers. No alcoholic drinks free or for purchase. Quite disappointing for several passengers. A lot of soft drinks and juices provided. In Cairo a lot of waiting taxi-ing remote parking of aircraft within the airport caused 1 hour unnecessary arrival delay.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew out on A330 to Luxor - not good. We were in row 34. The entertainment was appalling small screens over the centre could not be seen properly (3m away at an angle) and the choice of audio/music for Western ears was unbelievably bad. The pre-film entertainment seemed drivel and there was no choice of film of course. At meal time there was no choice all the chicken was gone fish only. Would you like a drink sir? Yes please Orange juice. Sorry no Orange juice. Seats seemed fine with good leg room. Return from Cairo in a Boeing 777-300 row 32. Individual back seat screens not a wide choice of viewing but passable for 5 hrs. Audio/music unbelievably bad. Lunch time was handed a meal "What is it? Fish. No thank you. You have to have it there is nothing else left! Seats were good. Will never fly Egypt Air again.

### Egyptair customer review
Rome to Cairo and Cairo to London. Both flights were quite pleasant meals were average economy standard meals. B737-800 from Rome and B777-300 to London. B777 had a more up to date inflight entertainment system but I didn't find a lot that appealed to me. Newspapers (English and Arabic ) offered on both flights. The flight attendants were ok if somewhat distant. One in particular on the London flight was an expert in looking busy but actually doing very little. During the newspaper offering service her interpretation of service was pushing the trolley down the aisle past expectant passengers without glancing up at anyone as she was too busy reading the paper herself.

### Egyptair customer review
A mixed bag describes my recent experience on flights between Bangkok/Cairo and Cairo/JFK. As another writer recently bemoaned the aircraft used on the Bangkok/Cairo sector was truly ancient. I do not honestly recall having riden an airliner that looked as worn as that used on this route. I too rode in Business Class yet felt like a sardine in coach class given the paltry amount of leg room available. A complete disaster was averted by fairly decent (but not great) meals and a hard working flight crew. The trip from Cairo/JFK was a totally different story. This time we were on a new 777 with lie flat seats. We had a very caring crew that kept on feeding us meal after meal. Both flights were relatively on time and both captains kept passengers reasonably informed.

### Egyptair customer review
LHR to JNB return. LHR to Cairo on new aircraft clean good inflight entertainment staff very good and food not too bad. Cairo to JNB was on an older aircraft with the old TV on the wall service was pretty good though. Would have preferred the newer planes on the longer leg of the journey. Return trip was the same JNB-CAI an older plane and CAI-LHR new plane! Expectations were too high in the first place so not bad at all.

### Egyptair customer review
BKK-CAI Business class. A terrible experience. Star Alliance standards? The flight was terrible an extremely old 777 with economy class legroom and no proper recline. Only 21 seats and no service. I asked for juice and the empty glass was in the arm rest for only 8 hours. Not even once a cabin attendant asked if needed something. A third class breakfast was served. I cannot understand how Egypt air was accepted to Star Alliance with such a low standards.

### Egyptair customer review
BRU-CAI-SSH. Snow disruption. Flight delayed 3 hours. Snow can happen but we were boarded in the plane (old A321) even as MS knew the luggage handling was delayed for hours more. We were sitting in the plane for 2 more hours without any communication about the reason of the extra delay. Cup of water after more than 1.5 hrs and passengers complaints. Push-back with more than 5 hrs delay. Still no comment from crew. Pilot never addressed passengers during flight safety demo aborted for take-off crew unsmiling inedible food. Arrival in CAI with big delay connection to SSH was gone. Kept us waiting until 05.30 in the morning in the transit zone. Only then they said us there was no seat on any flight for SSH during the day and that we had to go to hotel. We had to argue very strongly to get our boarding passes printed before we left for that hotel. They knew it already 99during the night but wouldn't put us in hotel too early because they have to pay for extra night in the hotel. We only got voucher after asking for it. This is not the Egyptian hospitality I know. Shame on you Egypt Air.

### Egyptair customer review
Heathrow to Johannesburg via Cairo and back. Heathrow to Cairo was excellent with a comfortable seat food and service good. Cairo to Johannesburg not as good as - an older aircraft with no seatback entertainment but cabin staff were good. The return flights were pretty much the same. Good value for money if you book early and get cheap tickets.

### Egyptair customer review
LHR-CAI with 2 day stopover before continuing CAI-JNB and then back to LHR. First flight a BMI codeshare - attendants pretty disinterested and plane was tatty. Cairo to Joburg on the old Airbus - no personal TV but midnight departure I was interested in sleeping. Got the Airbus back to Cairo where a lost walking stick threatened to derail my impressions of EgyptAir up to that point. Ground staff were quite apathetic although at the last minute a very good manager took on my complaint and was waiting for me at the departure gate to London with my stick - excellent. Flight back to London was on the new Boeing which was lovely. Food on all legs acceptable for economy class although I would have preferred more drinks rounds. Attendants pleasant enough - no complaints.

CAI-BRU return Business Class old A321. One meal was served food. No personal TV screen and seat was not even reclining. Check in smooth new terminal in Cairo is very nice. Lounge also nice. Crew friendly and attentive.

### Egyptair customer review
JNB-CAI-AMS A340 and B737. We thought we were mentally prepared for Egypt Air but no. The A340 business class seats would not have been out of place in a premium economy cabin : hardly any recline no leg room video monitors in front of cabin only. B737 had better leg room video on demand but no foot rest. This means when in a reclined position legs start hurting after a while. Verdict on Egyptair : cheap but certainly not cheerful.

### Egyptair customer review
EgyptAir coach class JFK to Cairo bulkhead seats were roomy plane was immaculate and the hot meal served above average for airlines. The flight attendants were pleasant and professional. During our trip we flew Egypt Air from Cairo-Luxor Aswan-AbuSimbel-Cairo flights on time and planes clean with ample leg room. On our return we had the opportunity to fly business class on new B777-300 - plane was immaculate service and food exceptional.

### Egyptair customer review
London to Kuala Lumpur via Cairo one day after Heathrow was re-opened. Original departure time from LHR was 1400 but delayed until 1900. No Egypt Air ground staff to be seen at all. No updates on why our flight was delayed or whether all of us will be able to catch our connecting flights in Cairo. Outbound journey from LHR to Cairo using new Boeing-777 impressed with entertainment system but food was horrible. I do have to give credit when we arrived in Cairo they made sure that all transit passenger flights will be waiting for us. There were many passengers flying to Johannesburg and Kuala Lumpur from London on that flight. The final leg to Kuala Lumpur was awful. The aircraft was an old Airbus no personal tv. The toilet doesn't seem to be cleaned at all. No comment as well with the food. Overall it was a below average experience flying with Egypt Air.

I had confirmed ticket from Hurghada to London via Cairo in December. My luggage was booked through to London boarding card issued till Cairo citing systems issues. On reaching Cairo I was informed that the Cairo-London flight was cancelled (snow disruption) I could collect my baggage there and go to customer services - they directed me to ticketing to determine flight options. Most unhelpful personnel there who told me next available flight to London was after 2 days that I would need to make my own stay & other arrangements. They refused my request to be rerouted through other locations (which flights were operational). I finally paid £200 more to go to Paris (on a flight a couple of hours later) over the £360 one way fare and then paid another £99 to get to London from Paris. I recommend using EU airlines who are regulated by EU regulations.

JNB-CAI and CAI-LUX return. Not the friendliest crew but not unwelcoming. Seats were comfortable and food edible if you go for that kind of food. We booked and paid early so the fares were a steal.

### Egyptair customer review
Egyptair Express a short flight Hurghada to Cairo. There were 3 flight attendants on the flight in which none of them greeted the passengers until half way through boarding when a male flight attendant appeared and happily helped customers. The cabin was tidy seats comfortable and leg room was generous. The safety demonstration - none! Of course there was the range of beverages available. We were served by 2 female flight attendants didn't smile once. just stared at you blankly until you asked them for a drink service was slow and there wasn't much time to finish your drink! Disembarking was pretty similar to boarding.

LIS-CAI-LIS. Both flights with one hour delay. Staff very impersonal entertainment very poor. The food was acceptable plane was clean and looked new. An average experience with a good relation quality / price.

### Egyptair customer review
AMM-CAI-LUX LUX-CAI-ATH. We chose Egyptair for relatively cheap fares and convenience around Egypt and the middle east. First flight ordinary cabin crew was a little incompetent and seemed a bit young. Flights to and from Luxor were alright nothing bad but nothing too good either. Flight to Athens was quite pleasant nice and friendly staff food edible for once.

### Egyptair customer review
MLA (Malta) to BKK via CAI. First leg on the EgyptAir Express subsidiary clean comfortable and smart new Embraer 170. An excellent light meal served. CAI-BKK an old and slightly shabby 777 with no personal entertainment and only one (Arabic) movie shown on the large screens. Leg room in economy excellent. Two meals served both average and uninspiring but not terrible. Cabin crew on both legs were efficient but not as polite or friendly as with some airlines. One attendant spent most of the MLA-CAI leg chatting to a passenger she seemed to know. No alcohol available on either flight. Check-ins were very smooth. All in all I was pretty satisfied given my low expectations and the fairly low price of my ticket.

### Egyptair customer review
New York to Cairo and return and wished we had waited until January 2011 when the new 777-300ER will be available. Service ordinary seats were better than economy but only barely. Attendants helpful when asked but did not go out of their way to assist. The domestic trips on Egypt Air were better than the flight over.

### Egyptair customer review
I generally fly EgyptAir about 4 times per year and have become used to shabby service. My other options are BA or BMI and they are not much different when it comes to customer service. I find the staff on EgyptAir lazy and unprofessional who just try to get from one side of the Atlantic to the other without too much bother. I think they should lower their prices or up the quality of service with better trained staff.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-BKK Business Class on an old B777-200. The seats are cramped movie sound was scratchy and headsets cheap ear insert type. No noise cancelling headsets available. I skipped dinner and took breakfast. The hot meal was only warmed slightly. The attendant called the senior attendant to ask what was wrong in a manner that suggest I was the only problem passenger. The man next to me said he had also a different hot plate and it also was cold and his hot tea was cold.

### Egyptair customer review
London to Johannesburg via Cairo. New plane to Cairo excellent with great inflight entertainment. Older plane to Johannesburg - no entertainment. Staff extremely helpful pleasant food and timekeeping great. The price was excellent too. Transfer at Cairo easy and people there helpful too.

### Egyptair customer review
Rome to Durban. Never again. I would rather go via Moscow next time with any other airline because nothing could be as bad as EgyptAir. Dirty aircraft with disinterested crew. The toilets were filthy food looked like leftovers from other airlines. The seating is exceptionally cramped and uncomfortable. And it wasn't cheap! I notice with amusement that it is a Star Alliance member. How can this be considering the wonderful airlines that belong this alliance eg. Singapore Airlines etc.

### Egyptair customer review
Roundtrip on Egyptair JFK to Cairo. B777-200 interior very dirty and tired looking. The aisles and toilets were not cleaned at all during the flights. Drinks only offered during the meal service. I had to go to the galley several times on both flights and ask for water and flight attendants seemed like I was bothering them and asking them to do me a big favor. I felt that Egyptair did not take the safety briefings seriously as they were quickly shown on the overhead screens while attendants were passing through the cabin handing out newspapers. On both flights passengers got up out of their seats immediately after the plane landed but we were still taxing to our gates. The overall lack of service from the flight attendants was not enjoyable. Egyptair need to dramatically improve by updating their aircraft with better inflight entertainment and improve their cabin services (both meal and beverage) in order to be close to the service provided by other Star Alliance and international airlines.

### Egyptair customer review
LHR-CAI A330-300 CAI - LHR A330-200. Only flew with Egyptair because required to do so by client. Outbound aircraft new and pretty impressive. Shame they went for business class seats that don't go to proper flat beds - you just feel as though you're sliding off these. IFE good and details of movie choice on screen. Food pretty good and service OK. Return aircraft old style and that was reflected in the service too. Clunky old-fashioned seat. Out of date magazine with no current movie details - when I pointed this out to FA she told me it was her first flight of the day and I'd just figure it out during the flight. Food OK but not as per menu. Supposedly seasonal fresh fruit selection was a lot of apples and two very green bananas. Would not pay to fly this airline if it were my own choice especially as it is dry and yet charges the same as the BA/BMI in Business.

### Egyptair customer review
IST-CAI-KUL and back was a good experience and worth the price in economy. Of course things could be much better as most reviewers here mentioned. For example if you pre-order vegetarian meals several months before the flight they should have it on all segments of your flight (they missed one out of four in this case). And it's true that making use of the long layover service (reviewed in detail on Flyer Talk) is stressful. Their sales offices check-in staff in countries outside Egypt and support service staff in Cairo all seem to say different things regarding what is possible and what is not on your layover. And come on which airline does not have online check in these days? And where are my frequent flyer miles on a Star Alliance partner airline's program more than 5 weeks after flying?

### Egyptair customer review
FRA-CAI-DXB / KWI-CAI-FRA. FRA-CAI leg on a modern B737-800 with good legroom and decent food. 3 hours time to transit in CAI with the boarding pass for the continuing leg only available at the transit desk in CAI. Star Alliance Lounge in CAI is ok however quality wise way below other Star Alliance lounges. CAI-DXB a new 777-300ER with lie flat seats. KWI-CAI on a 20 year old A320 very tired plane. Last leg an A330-200 old style business class recliner seats with excellent legroom. Problem is that the product is not yet consistent in terms of seat quality offered plus the older planes feel a little dirty. Biggest problem for MS from my perspective is the staff that is not friendly at all. A smile does not cost anything but can make a big difference.

### Egyptair customer review
AMS-CAI-KUL BKK-CAI-AMS. The worst and most unprofessional experience I have ever had on an airline. A330 and B777 have very tired interiors toilets are not cleaned during the flight. Although food is hardly ever amazing this time it was really bad (specially BKK-CAI section). Drinks only offered during the meal service at other times you can try to get 1 glass of water at the galley it feels like asking for a big favour. During the landing the family friends and EgyptAir crew start taking out their phones already and calling. Flight crew on duty sitting across or close do not say a word.

### Egyptair customer review
KUL-CAI-KUL. A330'internal condition is terrible. Foot rests are broken. Horus magazine is not available. Inflight entertainment not functioning even in a 10 hours long flight. At check in you are not allowed to book any of the first row seats even though you have a baby with you. Obviously those seats are reserved for the so called security officers and the staff relatives and friends. Announcements during the flight are not clear - hardly understand the crew's language pronouncation. It's a terrible experience but the cheapest.

### Egyptair customer review
Athens-Bangkok via Cairo. The reason for flying with Egypt Air after 10 years was the low price for this flight and the fact that now is a Star Alliance member. But everything is the same like before except the new logo on the aircraft and the Star Alliance logo everywhere! Athens-Cairo was an A320 in a good condition with a lot space for the legs. On arrival at Cairo airport we had 6.5hours for the connection flight. We were informed from their office in Athens that we had transfer to hotel for these hours. I went at their office and an inpolite employee told me to give a ticket for going upstairs at the restaurant for eat something. I asked the hotel saying that this was the deal buying the ticket and it is not possible stay at the restaurant for 65 hours. He answered saying that the time for to fix the visa is about 2 hours and after that I'll have short time at the hotel. After 30 mins they eventually took us out without visa and passport! The hotel was great nice lunch and room. The time we had to go back there was nobody from egypt air to call us. By ourselves we found minibus from the hotel to take us back to the airport. Cairo-Bangkok was on a tired B777no personal tv main screen with a bad view and no sound at most parts. This airline needs big steps for to be equal or near to the other Star Alliance members and really I wonder how Star Alliance decide which airline will join this group.

London Cairo London in Business. New A330s. seats excellent and clean cabin with friendly staff. IFE new and works well but not a huge choice of films etc. Food not up to scratch though and no alcohol.

### Egyptair customer review
BKK-CAI-DUS return. BKK-CAI on very old and run down B777-200. Business class seats the ultimate nightmare. No legroom and seat hardly reclines. The seats in Y class looked more comfortable. No menu only fish or chicken or beef poor quality of food. Blankets were out of stock. I was unable to view the IFE since the tiny screens could not be brought into position while the person in front of me declined his seat. There was simply not enough space. Amenity bags only available on BKK-CAI not on the return flight. No toothbrush eye-shade and earplugs available. Overall the ultimate horror flight. What a difference from CAI-DUS - new B737-800 with comfortable seats good service good IFE and food with a menu and blankets.

### Egyptair customer review
London - Kuala Lumpur return. Superb cabin and seats in the new 777-300 from London. Older style business class seats on the KL leg. Service was fine although the food and entertainment should be improved. Boarding slow and disorganised but all flights left within 45 minutes of schedule and felt safe. For the price paid it was excellent value and I would use again as you can stop over in Cairo.

### Egyptair customer review
Good value for money. Efficient staff ordered special meal and arrived as ordered. Planes rather old and tired duct tape holding things together in the bathrooms for example but good leg room. Easy interchange at Cairo - travelling Johannesburg to Paris via Cairo in Economy. Recommend for people on a budget who are not expecting too much.

### Egyptair customer review
Bangkok – Cairo return. I almost booked business class but thanks to the previous reviews I didn’t. I am glad I didn’t waste the money. The seats looked very small and very little leg room for business class. On the other hand economy was quite comfortable. The food was fine. The portion on BKK–CAI leg was small. The breakfast consisted of 3 pcs of bread. But the portion on CAI–BKK was more. Nothing wrong with the service on the ground and on the flight. The plane was dated but was not a problem for me.

### Egyptair customer review
Bangkok - Nairobi stop-over in Cairo of 17 hours. On both Egyptair flights the seat was extremely uncomfortable (defective head-rests which kept sliding down behind the back; sleeping impossible). The inflight-entertainment was terrible - only one third rate movie was shown - the same on both flights. The music programme did not provide a real choice. The food was mediocre service unfriendly. Drinks were not provided during the night. Very good is the provision of accommodation during the Cairo stop-over at a 4-star-hotel near the airport. However before I left on my journey a local Egyptair rep told me that no accommodation would be available. She recommended that I spend my time in Cairo - between two overnight flights in the heat of July. After two hours at the very cold Cairo airport I accidentally found out that Egyptair provided rooms to stop-over passengers.

### Egyptair customer review
Traveled today from Guangzhou via Bangkok to Cairo. Food in business was good and plenty. Cabin crew was okay apart from the purser. Seats were very bad. Only 45 degree angle at the most and not so much leg space. Sleeping hardly impossible. When front seat declined backwards you could not get out of your seat anymore. Price was cheap for this flight in business. But I recommend to invest maybe 300US$ more and book a better airline.

### Egyptair customer review
We had a return flight from Johannesburg via Cairo to Europe. All went well flying out but our return flight Cairo to Johannesburg was delayed for about 6 hours. Instead of departing at 0030 we departed after 6:00! We were disappointed in the way how Egypt Air treated us during the delay - no explanation given. We were told every hour that the flight is still delayed another hour or so. No blankets or pillows were offered and we were lying on the floor trying to sleep as we had to sit right through the night! Every official we spoke to just shrugged their shoulders and walked off!

### Egyptair customer review
FCO-CAI-KUL-CAI-MXP for 420 Euros return. Service and food on all flights was good. Load on KUL-CAI was only 40% so able to stretch out. Due to the long time between the flights in CAI (6-7 hours) they offered us a free hotel stay in the Iberotel including dinner and breakfast. The staff managed to fill out all paper work (transit visa) within 30-45 minutes. We had a great value for money on Egyptair.

### Egyptair customer review
Johannesburg-Cairo-Moscow in Business. Old style seat on Joburg-Cairo leg but quite good for sleeping. Lots of legroom. Staff friendly and fairly attentive. Moscow leg in regional type plane also with older style seats big seat and very comfortable. Staff on this leg more attentive and caring. All flights on time.

### Egyptair customer review
ATH-CAI-KUL return Economy Class. We arrived CAI at 16.30 impressed with the new T3 nice clean and organized. We had connection flight to KUL in the night at 01.15. Due to wait of 8 hours for the next flight to KUL Egyptair staff welcomed us and offered us to stay free in a 5 star hotel (incl transfer + buffet dinner). All flights were ok cabin crew food and seats okay. In general for what we paid we had an excellent service.

### Egyptair customer review
KUL-Cairo-JFK flight business class was not on par with any long distance business class we've ever flown. The chairs barely inclined and were very uncomfortable even for our 2 young daughters. We ordered vegetarian food which was extremely bad. They gave us boiled vegetables with no seasoning in business class. I'd hate to think what economy class passengers ate. We'd rate the service very ordinary and really not worth the amount we paid for the class of service expected. I don't know about value for money in economy but it was absolutely not worth the amount spent on business class to travel this route.

### Egyptair customer review
RUH-CAI return on Egyptair. Check in at Riyadh was utter chaos. Every Egyptian traveller on the flight was at least 40 to 50 kilos above the limit. Check in delayed because of constant arguments over excess baggage. RUH-CAI sector serviced by fairly new B777 but there was no IFE and food extremely basic. No additional water provided by staff or drinks offered after meal service. Several babies on board but staff did not bother providing seat belts and neither did the staff check passengers seat belts on arriving in Cairo. Safety standards very lax. The return trip was an antiquated B737.500 Staff a bit more attentive but service was very mediocre.

### Egyptair customer review
Bangkok-Cairo-Jeddah return. Traveled in a 20 person group but seats given far away from each other in every flight. Also we as a family of four (children age 10 and 8) also given seating far apart although checked in earlier than three hours. The leg room is quite big food is a lot but not much variation. Services in between meal is lacking no water provided. Also when service person called not answered - therefore have to walk to the galley ourselves.

### Egyptair customer review
SXF-CAI-CAN on Economy Class. Two totally different flights the first one between Berlin and Cairo was very good I was even impressed about the bad comments I read here before to buy the ticket (I bought it because it was the cheapest option). And then a week later I had a dreadful experience on my way to China. Service and food were good on SXF-CAI without IFE though. But the 14 hours ride between CAI and CAN with a stopover in BKK was horrible. Terrible food and attention (and very bad behaved passengers too). I will never use this airline to fly to Africa or Asia although it seems they made the effort to show their best face on their flights to Europe.

### Egyptair customer review
JNB-CAI. Impossible to imagine how this dreadful airline made it into Star Alliance. Their aircraft are old and uncomfortable Business Class is little better than recliner armchairs - they claim to have flat-bed seats but these are only fitted onto B777-300 aircraft it will probably take them 10 years to have them rolled out to the rest of the fleet. Food was adequate but unimaginative inflight entertainment very limited with only a few channels not in Arabic. Their lounge at the new (but already grubby and dilapidated) Terminal 3 at CAI is small shabby poorly equipped (no showers for example) and for some reason full of children (clearly having a friend at EgyptAir is the way to travel). If you have any choice at all avoid this sub-par carrier.

### Egyptair customer review
Guangzhou to Bangkok and on to Cairo as well as several domestic sectors within Egypt. Very poor customer service. Long delays with no help from ground staff or managers. Food and cabin crew attitude bad towards customers.

### Egyptair customer review
Even with strike in Paris airports we managed to arrive on time but very cramped and bad service. Staff indifferent and unhappy just asking for a cup of coffee after our meal was a big deal - had to ask 3 people for it. Food not good and no choice. Airplane seems a bit worn in general.

### Egyptair customer review
Cairo to Hurghada on their Express subdivison a short hop of 45 minutes. Lack of clear signage at Cairo Airport for C-Class check-in counters. The domestic Lounge at Terminal 3 is a Joke. A small squeezed room which can hold maximum 15 people with dirty seats and two fridges of the size you expect as a 3 star hotel minibar. Went in and straight out again. Seating outside this "Lounge" was much more comfortable and roomier. Chaotic boarding. Embraer 170 had a 2x2 seating in Y and C class - with no difference between. Welcome juice was provided and after take off two small sandwiches handed out by the crew with one round of drinks. Despite a cup on the tray no Coffee or Tea were offered even though there had been enough time till landing. I only paid just a small amount more then the regular Economy fare otherwise Ii would have been really upset by this kind of service - even if it is a short flight.

### Egyptair customer review
CAI-JNB on A330-200. Check in disorganized and chaotic even for business class. And the boarding gate was too small and far too cramped to accomodate all the passengers. Onboard we sat waiting for takeoff for 45 minutes - no explanation for the delay nor apology was offered. Because the flight operated after midnight only a quick beverage service offered before the flight attendants disappeared for the near duration of the flight. I tried to sleep but the limited recline of the seats didn't provide for comfortable slumber. The old generation overhead video didn't allow much in the way of entertainment either. Before arrival in JNB the flight attendants served a continental breakfast that was on par with economy class offerings. Finally my last issue was with the baggage delivery upon arrival. Fifty minutes is too long to stand around waiting for bags and then the business class bags seem to have been randomly loaded and were not among the first to arrive. Would I fly MS again - as a last resort only but then only on a short haul flight. I dont have safety concerns with this carrier but their service standards are years behind European and Asian counterparts.

### Egyptair customer review
We were trapped in Cairo and there was no help no communication and absolute chaos in the Terminal. I would never use this airline again. The aircraft are old and worn and the service was surly at best on the flights.

### Egyptair customer review
Flew Egypt Air but got stuck at Cairo on our way from Aswan to Heathrow last Saturday because Heathrow closed. No help from airline to pay for our accoMmodation or food. Other airlines are supplying accommodation but not EgyptAir. We were stranded for 4 nights which we had to pay for! Although the planes were comfortable food not very good.
