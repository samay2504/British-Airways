### “most incompetent people I ever dealt with”
I missed a local flight due to weather conditions, and then they wanted to charge an extra $8,000 for my family and I to get home. Bought a cheaper flight with Qantas. Trying to get a refund which went nowhere then I tried to get a letter from them that I could send to the travel insurance company. This has been ongoing for over a week with several phone calls back to South Africa. The most incompetent people I ever dealt with. Never flying with them ever again.

### “we still have not received our luggage”
Not Verified | We flew from Johannesburg to Perth on 21 July and were told on arrival in Perth that our luggage had not been put on the plane because of 'weight issues' on the plane. We were given a reference number and were told our luggage would be delivered to us by Wednesday 24 July. It is now Friday 26 July (5 days after we have landed!) and we still have not received our luggage! Additionally, no one has contacted us to inform us what is going on with our luggage and I have tried numerous times unsuccessfully to contact the SAA luggage handlers at Perth International Airport. We have all our toiletries, make up, shoes and clothes in the suitcases as well as a 200-year-old teddy bear which was passed down to my husband when my father in law passed away in May this year. This experience has been extremely stressful and hugely inconvenient and still we haven't heard from anyone at SAA who can actually tell us where our two checked in suitcases are. We will definitely not be flying with SAA again!

### "South Africans take the cake!"
I expected the Egyptian check in people to be difficult but boy was I wrong - the South Africans take the cake! I flew from Cairo with a transit in JHB before arriving in CPT. My bags were easily admitted in Cairo as they were 26kg and 12kg respectively. The sum of both was 8 kilos less than the permitted 46 kilos of weight that SAA allows. Yet in JHB the check-in enforcer insisted that I must transfer 3 kilos from the heavier bag to the lighter one, even with a 32kg max allowance sign hanging right behind him. I tried to persuade him to let this one go - he was immovable. This re-packing, I had to do with a long queue behind me, in full view of everyone in sight, going through my underwear and carefully wrapped/packed items that were now dishevelled in order to placate the gods of South African Airways and their arbitrary baggage rules on weight distribution. Both bags end up on the same plane! This kind of unyielding strictness is incredibly unreasonable and poor for maintaining any loyalty you might want to foster in your customers. I know business class gets 32kg x2 for every customer - so please don't tell me this was to save the employees backs from needing a chiropractor. By the time I was finally checked in, I was hot, sweaty and very angry with SAA. The noose gets tighter every year with your restrictions. Saying yes to me would pose no threat to the airplane or to your profits. Please consider reasonable allowances for your customers.

### "on board service was good"
Not Verified |  Following the demise of BA Comair we were booked onto SAA for the final leg of a return from the UK on BA. What a pleasure to find a proper business class seat with good legroom, compared with the European standard economy class seat with the middle seat blocked. Check in and boarding were efficient and on board service was good. There were no hassles with the transfer at ORT and the A320 on the second leg had the best regional business cabin I have experienced. Very spacious 2x2 configuration. Again service was good, and our overall impression was the the staff were very pleased to be back and keen to provide top service.

### "We want our monies back"
My husband and I bought tickets in March 2020 to travel from Columbus, OH to Accra Ghana, then the pandemic hit so our flights was cancelled by the airline. Since then we have even bought tickets and travelled to Ghana and back to the US and still nothing from South Africa Airways. They are not responding to emails and they are not responding to calls either. We want our monies back, almost $2500 is not little money and we work hard for it.

### "refused to refund my money"
South Africa Airlines canceled my flight New York to Polokwane via Johannesburg and has refused to refund my money I paid. According to the Department of Transportation they are required to refund my money because they canceled my flight due to Covid19.

### "lounge was closed due to lockdown"
I arrived to Johannesburg on an international flight on 26 March 2020, which was the last day before lockdown in South Africa. Due to the lockdown, most domestic airlines already stopped flying on the 25th. This seat in Business Class on SAA was the only option I had to get back to Cape Town, as US$275 one way for the 2 hour flight. When I arrived at the Business check in counters it was like the airline had already shut down. I went over to the Economy check in area and again there were no passengers and no staff. I turned to walk away, and that is when I saw 3 check in agents dragging themselves back to checkin. The explanation offered was that things were quiet, so they all decided to take a lunch break together. After I was checked in, I enquired about the lounge, as this was a business class ticket, however I was informed that the SAA lounge was closed due to the lockdown. Fine, I understand that they need some time to shut things down, but how about offering a voucher for a coffee and a sandwich like any respectable airline would do? I did pay full fare after all. I enquired about this at the ticket counter, but the very agent told me that "there are no contingencies in place for the lounge. When I stated that normally a voucher would be offered, he became defensive and started telling me that he was about to lose his job. The flight boarded on time. This was probably the only thing they did right. After everyone was on board, we waited for a good 30 minutes while the crew kept telling us that "there were more passengers on the way", and that we needed to wait for them. No boarding refreshments were offered in Business. Eventually the person we were waiting for boarded the aircraft, and no, this was not a passenger at all it was a cabin crew. The business cabin on this A320 showed serious signs or wear. On my seat, the cover for the lifejacket in the central armrest would not stay shut as the catch was broken. We took off about 45 minutes late. Shortly after take off, the crew made an announcement: "due to the Coronavirus, we will not be serving lunch today. Instead you will each find juice in your seat pocket. That was it for the service.

### "poor customer service"
Not Verified | Very poor customer service. I could talk to a real person. And the one time I did, I was given a number that goes straight to voicemail, don’t even bother leaving a message because they don’t return calls and reply to your emails.

### "$300 charge for me changing my ticket"
Washington to Accra. I'm scheduled to fly in September 2020. I haven't flown with them yet and I'm already having a terrible experience with their customer service. I reschedule my flight amid the covid 19 craze. The guy schedule me on a wrong time. Two days later I found out and try to call to reschedule on the best date. After being on the phone for 45 mins, this agent came up on the phone to tell me about an extra $300 charge for me changing my ticket which is not my fault. This will be the first and the last time I will use this airline.

### "Had a terrible journey"
Bulawayo to London via Johannesburg. Had a terrible journey trying to get back to London. I understand that there is a Health pandemic, but a little courtesy and information goes a long way. My flight was cancelled whilst I was in transit. No warning or information given. Instead they told us that it was non of their business what we did next and not their responsibility to cater for the passengers. I was absolutely disgusted by the Customer service. I was stranded for 48hrs at the airport. No water, no food provided. Slept on the floor at the airport, not even a blanket provided. Now trying to claim my refund back and am being told I have to claim via my travel insurance or choose to use it for another day. I don’t think I will be using this airline in the near future. AMake matters worse, my luggage was lost and there is nothing they can do about it.

### "tell me there's nothing they can do"
Perth to Nairobi via Johannesburg. This was the first and last time to fly with the airline. We get to Johannesburg only to be informed that the last part of the journey i.e. to Nairobi had been cancelled. The day before I received an email asking me to upgrade my ticket and clearly the fact that the flight had been cancelled was more important. Then the staff at the airport tell me there's nothing they can do yet there were other airlines plying that route. My agent goes to the Perth office and gets other tickets with another airline. Then they forget to load my baggage into the KQ flight, something they said they would do.

### "worst airline I've ever"
I asked for champagne on board which every airlines serve on business class but SA doesn't. They don't have menu to choose from. The cabin crew comes and take your order and they only have 2 options to choose from. In flight entertainment is poor. Their worldwide call centers are the most terrible one I've ever came across. I was trying to change my date from Accra to Washington. I contacted the Accra office 3 times. Someone picked the call then hangs up as if I'm disturbing their peace. I contacted Johannesburg office and I was placed on hold for 30 mins until I ran out of airtime credit. I called back again and after being on hold for 25 mins a customer service rep came on the phone and placed me on hold again for another 30 mins until I hanged up. I called the Washington office and again I was placed on hold for one hour until someone answered then she placed me on hold after taking for my booking code. She kept me on hold for 1.5hrs and never returned to me. As I write this review I'm still on hold waiting to talk to someone because my flight takes off tomorrow and I need to do these changes before tomorrow. My husband is also on hold for 2 hrs hoping someone answers his call so he can talk to them on my behalf. It's quite expensive to call from Africa and I spent over $60 buying airtime credit just to call SA customer service but to no avail. What a horrible customer service and airline. This is my second time flying SA and I'm done with them. I'll advise my friends and family and everyone to stay away from this horrible airline. It's been 2.5hrs now and I'm still on hold. At this time I'm going to hang up and close the chapter with SA the worst airline I've ever.

### "Service was obliging"
Accra to Washington Dulles. Given the current situation globally, just glad that I got home. South African Airways is way below current standards for business class. My seat arm rest was broken and wouldn't collapse. This took about 6 inches off my sleeping space. My food was unappealing and limited options. Even though it is a flight with a late departure with only a light meal offered for dinner, I found that I was hungry after that service and there were not even biscuits or any sort of snack available. Service was obliging but seems their company has left crew with limited options to satisfy their premium cabin customers. Flight departed and arrived on time. Pursers announcements were the classiest I have heard in ages and announcements from the cockpit equally charming and informative -- something I told the captain when we met near the baggage carousel.

### "crew did the minimum possible"
Washington to Accra in business class. South African Airways uses TK lounge in Dulles which was jam packed with line ups for the washrooms. Boarding smooth with early departure from IAD. I was initially in 2A, but moved to 9K in the second business class cabin when I saw some kids a couple rows behind me. Big mistake because there was a young woman two rows behind me who wanted everyone to know that she was there and travelling in business class. She fussed over everything, talked loudly from her seat to a passenger behind her, flirted shamelessly with the male cabin crew and in the middle of the flight, when everyone else was asleep, talked a full volume in the galley. I had to get and tell the crew to tell her to shut the hell up. To no avail. Then, on final approach to ACC, she was sound asleep and couldn't be woken up. She was a complete idiot. At one point, she stood in the second galley and pointed to the first, larger business class cabin and announced, "that must be business class, but where I am (the smaller second business class cabin) must be first class because it is small". A complete idiot. Shame on the crew for letting her talk so loudly in the galley in the middle of the night. Service was ok but definitely no way near the standard of many airlines. The business cabin was just over half full, but the crew did the minimum possible. When I inquired as to how the seat is made up for sleeping, one FA just pointed at the two packages of blankets/padded cover and said, "there they are", as if I hadn't already seen them. No effort at all to help prepare my seat for sleeping. During the meal service, when it was time for dessert, I was asked what I wanted. I said I'd have the cheesecake and the cheese plate, then was told that it was 'company policy' that I could have one or the other. Really? In business class with a nearly half-empty cabin? Food was mediocre overall. I liked the bulkhead seat in the second cabin (row 9) because the foot area is double size, unlike a lot of the new coffin-like business seats where you feel like you are undergoing the world's longest MRI.

### "sue for compensation"
On March 5, we were scheduled to depart at 1 p.m. from Livingston to Johannesburg on Flight SA49. But, without warning, the airline cancelled the flight, and all passengers were transferred to the swing flight SA9040/SA41, which we had to fly from Livingston to Victoria Fall, and only then to Johannesburg. Since we had to catch a flight from Johannesburg to Istanbul at 7:15 p.m., we requested confirmation of the cancellation of the flight in order to return the money, buy other tickets and fly off a normal flight of another airline, British Airways. A Nsw representative from SA refused to do so, assuring us that we would arrive in Johannesburg just 1.5 hours later than the originally set arrival time (15:15 instead of 14:45). That was still enough to catch our plane from Johannesburg at 7:15 p.m. We were denied the return of tickets and sent to board the plane, where we and other passengers were simply blocked for several hours. The plane did not take off at 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. First they sorted the luggage, then it turned out that they did not have a flight permit to fly to Victoria Fall. At the same time, we were not allowed back from the plane and were physically deprived of the opportunity to fly on a flight of another airline, British Airways, which took off from Livingston on schedule at 13:30 and arrived in time for Johannesburg. As a result, we flew to Johannesburg at 6:25 p.m., 3 hours 40 minutes late than the scheduled arrival time. Despite the assurances of the crew that we would be helped to board our flight at 19:15 through the transfer corridor, this was not done. We were just escorted out of the plane and dumped at the airport. When we independently found the South african Airways office at Johannesburg airport and asked us to issue a certificate about the late arrival of the flight due to the fault of the airline, we were rude, our passport was taken away and did not want to give it away. To get the document back, we had to call the police. After that, immediately returned the passport and issued the required certificate. As a result, we lost our flight to Istanbul at 19:15, were forced to purchase tickets for alternative flights at our own expense. One of the passengers became ill at the SA (South African Airways) office, but the spokeswoman refused to call a doctor. The reason for the situation was the greed of South African Airways, which instead of two planes (the airline sold two flights to Johannesburg - from Livingston and from Victoria Fall) sent one plane, which was supposed to gallop around Victoria Falls, picking up and unloading passengers of two flights. At the same time, the airline did not even have permission to fly under such a scheme, but knowing that the flight in time is impossible, denied passengers their law the right to return tickets and tricked them to the plane, which was doomed to fly with great delay. The fact that the airline has problems is already written in the media. But perhaps it's time to stop selling tickets for flights that no airline is going to perform? We are preparing to sue for compensation for late services, denial of the right by law to a forced return of an cancelled/altered flight, and for leaving a passenger in danger in a state threatening his health, an official of South African Airways and refusal to call for medical assistance. We hope that Star Aliance, of which South African Airways is a member, and IATA will also pay attention to the situation.

### "wouldn’t refund our charges"
Not Verified |  My wife and I booked and paid for exit row seats 70 days before departure for the 15 hour flight from JFK to South Africa. We were notified at the gate that we were not in exit rows and not even in the same row. We both had middle seats. When we complained we were told there was nothing to be done. The wouldn’t refund our charges and we are still jumping through hoops. There is absolutely no customer service.

### "customer care before the flight"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Cape Town. It's not a review of a flight but about customer care before the flight. SAA canceled my flight, bought two weeks before. Considering it was a multi-track flight (6 flights) i booked all the seats, but after the cancellation of two of these, they erased all the booking seats. I asked to proceed to re-book the seats for free, because I already paid for them. I contacted the customer care on twitter and one operator was good and wrote me he/she rebooked all the 4 SAA flights. After 3 days the seats seems not yet booked and I'm trying again to have an answer from them on twitter, without success. I'm really disappointed.

### "all in all a great flight"
Not Verified |  Maputo to Perth via Johannesburg. Two great flights. Maputo-Johannesburg: The A320 is a brand aircraft with the new cabin. The seat is a comfortable leather, similar to the ones on the A330-300. The crew were really friendly. We had a delay leaving Maputo because our engines wouldn’t start due to a faulty APU. The captain and first officer were very nice and told us the situation. Johannesburg-Perth: The A340-300 was showing it’s age. I believe our plane was made in 2003. The economy seats were a bit old but comfortable. There was lots of legroom for the 8hr flight. The food was great and the service was amazing. The entertainment system was quite old but had up to date movies so you wouldn’t get bored. The two things I found a let down. The arm rest wouldn’t go all the way up due to the remote for the IFE situated there. Also how you couldn’t store any baggage during takeoff or landing if you are seated in the aisle. But all in all a great flight.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Cape Town to Johannesburg. Once again a very pleasant flight on SAA. The cabin crew was extremely professional and friendly. I fly many different airlines regularly and SAA ranks in my top 3 due to their excellent service. Their hard product may not be very competitive (still very comfortable though) anymore, but they surely make up for it in service and catering.

### "carry on luggage were weighed"
Washington to Accra. South African airways was the most affordable way for me to travel. If you are flying out of Washington, be mindful of your carry on luggage. All pieces of carry on luggage were weighed at least 3 times. If anything was over the limit, you were obligated to pay. If you go with South African, expect bad behavior and rudeness.

### "definitely fly SAA again"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. I was skeptical given the strike that only recently ended but I was pleasantly surprised by the ease and speed of the check-in. The plane was on time and the ground staff were excellent. Boarding was beautifully done and quick. We had a bus gate but that's a small qualm. Seats are old but comfortable. There were warm smiles all through the journey from the cabin crew. Drinks were a bit late in being served due to turbulence but we were informed accordingly. When they did come through, I was able to get more than one beverage. We arrived on time and my luggage was intact. Will definitely fly SAA again.

### "friendly crew on board"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. Good flight, very friendly service, helping and take care of customers. Good food, nice lounge before departure. Nice to fly with a friendly crew on board.

### "6 across in Business not acceptable"
Cape Town to Johannesburg. I've flown SAA over 50 times over the last 2 years, and without exception every flight has been on time. Crew have been consistently good. Now the moans, just flown on the A350 in Business, lovely aircraft, but 6 across in Business is not acceptable for a long haul flight these days, made worse by the fact that the seats on the A330-300 are 1-2-1 and are superb. There's no consistency. I travel to Europe regularly in Business and avoid SAA simply due to the seats on the older aircraft, they've been the same for over 15 years.

### "Keep up the good work"
London to Johannesburg. I have been a SAA gold card holder for years and will always support them. However Mango their codeshare internal partner are another story, some times internal flight connections after a long haul are not available with SAA and I end up on Mango who honestly have a terrible ontime record I can’t remember the last one that was actually on time. Keep up the good work in the times of change ahead.

### "delayed 1.5 hours"
Durban to Johannesburg. Airplane delayed 1.5 hours. I waited longer than the flight takes and they will only give a coffee voucher after 2 hours. No wonder they aren't a profitable company. Late for a meeting. I would never again trust this airline.

### "Wonderful airline to fly"
Lilongwe to London via Johannesburg. Wonderful airline to fly on, the aeroplane is in great condition with so many wonderful things available to the customer. Staff are very attentive and would make any other top class airline shy with how they ensure professional attention. Food is great and tasty. Seats are a little small but okay.

### "delays have been ridiculous"
Lubumbashi to Johannesburg. Lately the delays have been ridiculous. Waiting for my flight to leave at 11:45 and left at 16:45. Wont issue again a ticket with them for sure!

### "did nothing to assist"
Not Verified | Washington DC to Dakar. I purchased a round trip ticket to Senegal, West Africa for $2089 on July 28, 2019 for departure on August 9, 2019. A few weeks after I arrived, I was notified that South Africa Airlines was no longer offering service to Senegal. I had to travel four hours one way to Dakar to visit the South African Airways office. That was on September 19, 2019. Once I arrived at the office, I was offered to re-route my flight to Belgium with Brussels Airlines, which was not my choice because it interfered with my connecting flight once I returned to the United States. I would have to return a day earlier than that connecting flight, and I was told that was the only option available to me. South African Airways did nothing to assist me with getting an earlier connecting flight nor did they offer to give me a hotel or compensation for the inconveniences they put me through.

### "survival austerity campaign"
Johannesburg to New York. SAA are currently on a survival austerity campaign that is now reflecting in their Business class service and offerings. No longer do they offer pre dinner drink service and the finer parts of their service have been jettisoned. Salt & pepper cellars are packeted; the range of wines are weird - 2 chardonnays in a choice of 3 wines; no after dinner chocolates; breakfast no longer includes cereals, fruits and a main course. You now have to choose one of these 3. For a Usd 7000 airfare these penny pinching cost savings will not save the airline but will rather ensure its ultimate demise.

### "she had seated me next to toilet"
Cape Town to Perth via Johannesburg. I broke my arm and needed to return to Perth for operation. When I requested a more comfortable seat on check in the staff complied. On boarding I discovered she had seated me next to toilet in a non recliner. The staff refused to attempt any change, a man stepped in and offered his seat.

### "Entertainment System was unusable"
Perth to Johannesburg. I do not sleep well on flights and rely on Entertainment System to occupy me. Sometime after take-off the Entertainment System was turned on. Some airlines turn on the system after un-docking from the terminal. Immediately there were issues with the sound being disjointed. Soon after (within 15 mins) I asked a stewardess about the problem. She said she would get back to me – BUT never did. The Entertainment System was unusable for the flight. This is unreasonable. Not once was any announcement made about the fault in the system. On leaving the plane I complained to a steward at the door and was told to complain to someone. I have email SAA Customer Service and completed this review.

### "the staff seemed agitated"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Dar es Salaam with South African Airways. The cabin crew on this flight seemed like they did not want to be there serving the passengers. There were instances where the staff seemed agitated by some of the requests of the passengers in front of us, and were very unprofessional and borderline rude.

### "seats are blocked off for crew"
Johannesburg to New York. I flew on SA203 and booked a seat in the last row as I knew there were empty seats beside it. Seat 74D. I have a back injury and sitting long haul is difficult, so I was hoping to be able to stretch a little. I fly this route regularly, and always book this seat if it is available, and pay to do so in advance. As soon as I reached my seat I noticed the tray tables in that row were down. The purser for Economy was standing there and said she would have to move me. I asked why. Because these seats are blocked off for the crew," she said. If they were blocked of how was I able to book that seat? And it is the seat I always book, I have never seen it "blocked off. I explained to her that I had booked it specifically and she just stared at me. I felt very uncomfortable. She then blocked off two window seats at the side with her own luggage, forbidding another paying passenger hoping to sit there during flight (15 hours). Her bag stayed on that seat during flight as well as during taxiing, take-off and landing, unsecured, and despite turbulence. Twice during the night another cabin crew member told me abruptly that someone would be sitting in my row as their entertainment system wasn't working (several do not). I did not object. But that person never materialized. So what is SAA's policy about this last row, and also about bullying passengers? Finally, the same purser and an older female cabin crew member who had been working forward, also spent a lot of time complaining audibly about another crew member whom the purser said she would "like to stab in the back", it was incredibly unprofessional.

### "Most staff were indifferent and rude"
Not Verified |  Dreadful Business Class - Will never fly with SAA again. Previously one of top three airlines in the world SAA, Swiss Air and Singapore Airlines. Flew Perth to Johannesburg to Perth on old tired planes. The seats folded down and were lumpy like camping beds with a too short thin quilt to lie on, one small pillow and cover. Both seats did not initially work. The seat was much to short for my friend who is approx. 6 ft so he had to sit up most of the way unable to sleep. Most staff were indifferent and rude. Not one piece of fruit. This is not acceptable, we booked on Virgin and were disappointed.

### "came to board as gate was closing"
Cape Town to Nelspruit. They did not call my name for last boarding. Checked in 2 hours early, had a problem with an airport cafe, came to board as gate was closing and they refused to put me on. Staff were aggressive, did not assist, expected more money for a different flight with no concessions made. Unprofessional and unpleasant.

### "a flash back to the 80's"
Johannesburg to Mauritius. Flying South African in coach is a flash back to the 80's. Food (appetiser and main hot meal) was good compared to other airlines on a 4 hour trip. The service was very nice, and the bar well stocked. The seat had a lot of legroom (at least 33") for a person as tall as me (6'2"). The only downside was the entertainment, small scratched screens.

### "the service was rushed"
Mauritius to Johannesburg. This is one of the older aircrafts that South African Airways has, an Airbus 340 with a configuration of 2-2-2 in business. I really like the A340's as they are very silent and safe (4 engines). Although there is not much privacy between you and your neighbour, the space between the rows is humongous: even if the person next to you sleeps, you don't need to step over her/him. The airline provides you with a mattress, a duvet as well as a big pillow. The food is nothing special for a 4 hour flight, but decent. The cabin crew are very friendly and answers any request promptly, However on this flight the service was rushed: you don't have time to finish your drink before they come with the meal trolley.

### "flight delayed by half an hour"
Bloemfontein to Johannesburg. I am appalled by the horrendous service I received. I went to the airport in Bloemfontein with at least two hours to spare before we started boarding. Initially my flight was going to be at 5:00 pm and I would arrive at JHB international airport at 5:55 pm. However after not letting me know the flight had changed or even offering an earlier flight option I was told there is nothing they can do and the flight is delayed by half an hour. Because I needed to make a flight in JHB to Atlanta which is at the opposite side of the terminal I pleaded for reconsideration and nothing was done to help. We left at 5:40 pm and arrived at 6:50 pm however my connecting flight was at 19:51 and I was suppose to board at 19:00. Arriving at JHB airport no one was even willing to usher me to where I needed to be to make my flight in time. This caused me to run from arrivals to international departures (no one able to be any help), having to rudely jump the ques to attempt to make my flight on time and getting to boarding soaked in sweat. I feel this was so uncalled for and very unprofessional.

### "never book with them again"
Hoedspruit to Cape Town. Hoedspruit is a nice small airport with an indoor terrace. The flight experience was overall OK for a 2h30 flight. The real issue I had was with the booking. I received a confirmation for a wrong date, then called the customer service right away and they never agreed to make a change without a 25% penalty fee. Very frustrating considering there was a problem with the booking system. I'll never book with them again.

### "never use this airline again"
Johannesburg to Hong Kong. As we got on the flight we noticed on my pillow there was blood, and our entertainment system did not work! I feel it is totally unhygienic. After telling the flight attendant about the pillow she just grabbed one from an open seat and did not even apologize. I will never use this airline again.

### "entertainment system glitched"
c✅ Trip Verified |  Maputo to New York via Johannesburg. The entertainment system glitched throughout the entire flight to JFK and the seat function controls didn't work several times throughout the 17-hour flight (for up to 15-20 minutes per glitch period). Some people were stuck in a reclined position while others were stuck upright when it was time to sleep. On the returning flight, the TV screens were hardly responsive to touch and were very frustrating to use. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, if a passenger is seated next to a window, they can't step around or over their seatmate when the latter is in a reclined position. This means they have to wake up their seatmate to go to the bathroom, etc. The seat spaces are fairly cramped. For both SAA flights, I had to store my handbag in the overhead compartment for takeoff and landing. On the flight to JFK, they ran out of eggs for breakfast. This has never happened to me before. On the return flight for lunch, they ran out of salmon. On the departing flight, the flight attendant took away my untouched serving of butter and then, when I asked for butter later, said that each passenger is allocated only 1 serving of butter. Apart from the desserts, I found the food  not that much better than what's served in economy class. For most of the departing flight, there was  one overworked flight attendant serving our section, which meant that the service was very slow and they were not always prompt and sometimes forgot to offer hot towels, blankets, etc. I must say that my returning flight was much better in terms of service, quality, food, etc.) The lounge in OR Tambo is okay but a little chaotic, and the food looked unappetizing. The SWISS lounge for SAA business class flyers in JFK is awful. The food was okay, but the atmosphere was cold and staff were rude and distant. In general, the business class experience was certainly not worth the price of the tickets.

### "electricity went out"
SA 260 on 29 July from Johannesburg to Frankfurt. About 30 minutes into flight, electricity went out and did not came back on for 10hr duration of flight. The air hostess was extremely rude and unhelpful. They did not notify the passengers as to what was the cause/reason for the black out. When asked, I was told ‘We will not notify the passengers as it is a safety precaution’.

### "Worst airline ever"
Cape Town to Sao Paulo via Johannesburg with South African Airways. Worst airline ever. Disorganized, not very clean. Very old in every way. Very noisy, seats uncomfortable, little service. Food more like coach. Can’t believe I used lots of points for this experience. Worst business trip ever. Love Africa but need a better way to get there.

### "hardworking, efficient and cheerful"
London to Harare via Johannesburg. Left on time, seats uncomfortable for a long flight, but aircraft not full. Dinner served, beef stew, followed by breakfast at the end of the flight. Cabin crew disappeared during the flight. A319 from Joburg to Harare no empty seats. Served a snack which was an inedible cheese roll. Departed Harare on Airbus 320-more room on return flight and served a midday meal- tasty and good service on such a short hop to Johannes burg. A330 from Joburg to Heathrow a newer plane with much more comfortable seats than the outward flight. Served an evening meal which was not as good as the outward flight then cabin crew disappeared - turbulence so no hot drinks could be served. Went to the galley to get a coffee, obviously this is an unwanted intrusion on crew space, did not get the coffee. Breakfast was later served- an amorphous puddle of yellow calling itself an omelette. Saving grace was the female cabin crew who served us, very hardworking, efficient and cheerful.The pilot was good at communicating with the passengers as we went along.

### "very enjoyable flights"
London to Cape Town via Johannesburg. I just wanted to say how impressed we were with South African Airways. The staff at the check in desk and the cabin crew were very helpful, professional and friendly. The plane and its seats were very comfortable and extremely clean. This is in comparison to British Airways. The food was also very tasty. Overall we had very enjoyable flights. Well done SAA and we look forward to fly with you again. Thank you!

### "Serving lunch at 0930"
Johannesburg to Maputo. I like SAA, and they are always punctual. What I take exception to is their business class cabins on the A319 aircraft with 5 across seating, noticeably different to their A320s with only 4 across. SAA should not be selling the middle seat to ensure conformity. As the airline is struggling financially, I would have though it can't afford to alienate premium customers, but henceforth, if a flight is operated with an A319, I'll downgrade to Economy and save a small fortune. Serving lunch at 0930 in the morning is silly. Most passengers wanted tea and coffee and the crew had a trolley full of wine and champagne. Net effect, the crew really struggled to effectively serve hot drinks to a full cabin, they did just about manage, but it's obvious here whoever makes the catering decisions at SAA has done so to make his/her life easier, not the crew or the passengers.

### "could not cancel my flight"
Cape Town to George. I have never come across a more unprofessional, inefficient airline in my life. After having unplanned surgery days before my flight, I couldn't make my flight. As a result, (and including the travel insurance which I bought) I could not change my flight without paying the fee of the flight again and could not cancel my flight and get a refund on my booking. After calling in and being on hold, I spoke to an extremely rude woman who did not understand and could not answer my basic questions. I was told that if I were a gold-card member that I would be able to change my flight but as I am just an economy member, there is nothing they can do for me. After asking to speak to a manager I was put on hold for 30 minutes and eventually decided to write this review.

### "not willing to help
Sao Paulo to Hong Kong via Johannesburg. I had a okay flight from São Paulo to Johannesburg even tho the food experience was not good at all. My flight from Johannesburg to Hong Kong was canceled after we waited 3 hours inside of the plane for technical problems fixing. Apparently the aircraft had less then 50% air pressure and it was insufficient to a flight over 12 hours. We had to wait inside of the airplane for 3 hours (without airconditioning) just so they end up telling us that the flight is cancelled and we would flight the next day. They provided hotel but my flight was over 24 hours after. They could have changed aircraft or being nicer to costumers that were in the delayed flight. Instead I had to keep calling them for information about when I would flight and got very rude attitude from the staff  (I wanted to upgrade my flight from economy to business due to being 6 months pregnant). They were not willing to help and were very inefficient even tho I was paying for the upgrade. The last problem was that I had a connecting flight in HK and they said they were unable to check my luggage straight to the final destination so I would have to check out in HK get my luggage and check in again with the spare time of 1 hours between flights.

### "could not have been more disappointed"
Flew New York City to Johannesburg. Overall I could not have been more disappointed in this flight and airplane. For a 15 hour flight, the majority of the headphones jacks did not work and there was no option to use different headphones. There was no way to charge devices and no offer of internet (even at a charge). The crew was incredibly rude. We asked for water when they were serving coffee and got a strong eye roll even though water was on their cart. It was very disheartening. The food was packaged months ago and the majority of it made me nauseous from the smell. The only benefit to this flight was the cost however next time we will be paying the extra to fly Delta from Atlanta. It is time for South African Airways to update this plane or to only use it for shorter trips. It is just simply too out of date for this time of trip and is not fair to customers.

### "SAA is a solid airline"
Johannesburg to Perth was a mirror image of of the outbound. Hardly surprising since it was the same aircraft. Friendly crew and everything pretty much on the dot. Improvements? Firstly the quality of F & B. Par for the course but what about adding say a fiery Durban chicken curry to the mix? Something which says South Africa. Secondly the IFE is a bit dismal. It works and has a choice of viewing but its old. Thirdly, new aircraft. The A340 is a favourite but showing its a bit dated. A shiny 330, 350 or 789 would really elevate the experience. If not then refurbish the interiors. SAA is a solid airline but not yet up there with the Asian carriers. A word on OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg. I fell in between alliances. Im One World with Emerald status but flying Star Alliance (having insufficient status there). So the Emirates and SAA lounges were off limits, the Aspire lounge was pay as you go and so ended up at the Shongolo lounge which Qantas uses. Its ok as a place to shower up and sit. OR Tambo airport is terrible for seating if not in a lounge. Overall and being born in SA and a regular visitor, the whole experience was like Africa: chaotic in part, colourful but it will get you there eventually.

### "get you there safely"
Perth to Johannesburg. This was by far the most economic way to get to Johannesburg from Sydney. Qantas, my usual rise, was roughly double for direct service. Flying to Perth first with Virgin meant all my check in and boarding cards were issued in Sydney. Not having any checked baggage meant a clean passage through from Sydney to Johannesburg. Flight to Perth was fine, nice shiny A330-300 and typical Virgin cheerfulness. Now the SAA experience. Perth airport, Terminal 1, is a dismal place for an international departures terminal. Being a Qantas FF meant little and could not enter the lounge there run by Qantas but for other airlines. The lack of F & B amenity is simple to explain: Perth is not a major destination for international airlines. It is linked to the rest of the world with Emirates, Cathy I assume and Singapore airlines plus a few others. The boarding process was fine, seat was comfortable and a smooth ride. One single meal service in the evening which I declined having had something at the terminal (a burger and chips fills the gap). No snacks or refreshment between meals. Breakfast I usually avoid and so it was the case here. Smooth landing and into Johannesburg at 4.30 am. Out of the terminal doors by 4.55am. SAA are remind me a bit of British Airways. Good in parts, not so good in others and they get you there safely. It would be nice if they could have a little bit more of Africa in their overall experience.

### "very pleasantly surprised"
London to Cape Town via Johannesburg. Bearing in mind previous reviews it was with some trepidation that we boarded SA235 on 5 Feb. However we were very pleasantly surprised. The flight took off only 5 minutes late and arrived 30 minutes early. The plane was pretty new, the cabin was bright, cheery and the crew friendly and cheerful with great uniforms. Great food too and a proper breakfast not a cereal bar! Sadly the whole experience knocked BA in to a cocked hat. The onward flight to CPT was in an older plane but still on time and we had no complaints other than in the new A330-300s the seats are a bit hard and the tray tables ridiculously small! However we would certainly fly SAA again.

### "great crew and great food"
Not Verified |  Port Elizabeth to London via Johannesburg. Another excellent journey. Both flights on time, both planes almost new with bright cabins, great crew and great food. SAA are a revelation compared to BA.

### "entertainment systems being faulty"
Johannesburg to New York. We followed the normal reporting process and e-mailed SAA two weeks ago with no response. We reserved 3 seats for the trip going to New York and our return flight back to JHB. Before boarding this flight I phoned SAA and raised my concerns about on board entertainment systems being faulty which were laid to rest by your call centre lady saying I must request the ground staff to check entertainment systems before we take off to see if our systems are working so if there are technical problems they can be sorted before the plane hits the runway then it would be too late. This however did not prove to be factual at all. Once at the terminal the staff on the plane were rude and told us the systems could not be checked until the plane was in the air. So we sat back and waited hoping all would be okay until the emergency demonstration had been done and the entertainment systems started getting switched on then we started to see the overhead lights coming on one after the other. At this time we were still trying to figure out how to pull our entertainment systems from under our seats. With our luck Seat 45D had a picture but no sound. Seat 45E and 45F no picture or sound. So we complained with the other 20 or odd passengers at the time so they announced they were going to reboot the system. This happened twice. No change. The plane was not full so they started to move passengers around to seats to where there were screens to see if they could find available entertainment. My friend was moved twice and then gave up due to not being successful and came back to her seat next to me. The air was so hot where we were sitting we could not take it another minute so we called the air hostess who said she could not understand why it would only be our row. She came back later and said afterwards that there was a distinct temperature difference between the rest of the plane and our section and she would try and resolve it for us. She was very apologetic and accommodating. We were hoping that our return flight would be on a different plane as we checked and saw SAA has a few of these planes on their fleet and thought the likelihood of getting such bad luck a second time running in one trip would be unheard of. So we still went for the extra legroom and kept our reserved seats that we paid the additional R750.00 per person for, and lo and behold on flight SA204 departing from New York the seats I reserved again this time no sound no picture And a sweat box for the full flight.

### "shall not recommend SAA"
Johannesburg to Lodon. We booked the flight and also made advanced seat selection seats 55H and 55 K (more leg space) on 3d of August. Reason is that I am 1,90 m long. On the flight SA 234 on Friday the 11th from Johannesburg the airline has changed the type of airplane. They did not inform us before by e-mail, WhattApp, on there own SA-APP and also not at the counterdesk where we put our luggage. Therefore we paid for nothing and other people were sitting The staff of SA in the plain didn't do anything to help us and only said you can get your extra seat costs back at the counter in London.We didn't have a chance to upgrade or change our seats. We could not go to the counter because we had a connecting flight 1 hour later to Schiphol Amsterdam.It was very disappointed. I have sent an e-mail to SA customer services directly but did not receive any reply till now. On top of that a staffmember suddenly came in the plane with a insectide in aerosol and sprayed us all. It was a disaster. Total no feeling to the client. I shall not recommend SAA to anybody.

### "stewards were very attentive"
Not Verified |  We’ve heard a lot of bad reports about SAA. Nothing could be further from the truth. We left Perth at 23:45 yesterday and am now in Johannesburg awaiting a connecting flight to Cape Town. We left and arrived on time.Had a good dinner & breakfast,  not haute cuisine but very edible. Found that stewards were very attentive and quite free with the beverages and they were friendly. Had economy seats that gave a good deal of legroom, enough films to keep you occupied. What more can there be to this business. Well done SAA

### "Thank you SAA for your service"
Harare to Cape Town via Johannesburg. My flight from Harare was delayed by 20mins, In Johannesburg I was suppose to get my bags for security check but i waited for my bags at e carousel for 15mins or so but could not find my bags and i had to connect again for my flight to cape Town in less than an hour. I boarded without my bags and I was told to check on the carousel if i dont get them or i shloud go on the SAA baggage desk in Cape Town which i did. They were very helpful. They managed to locate my bags and they were sent on the next flight from Johannesburg to Capetown that very day and i was asked if i wanted to collect my bags at the airport or to be delivered at home. I chose to be delivered at home which they did. I got my bags everything was there and perfect. Thank you SAA for your service.

### "flight attendants were very friendly"
Johannesburg to Perth with South African Airways. The flight attendants were very friendly. They have a good sense of humor and are fun to talk to. The only thing was that they were barely seen after dinner and we had no snack service. The food was on point. The IFE had a surprisingly good selection of movies. The seats have really been worn down and look very tired. Besides those few problems, the flight was perfect.

### "okay with good service"
Not Verified |  São Paulo to Perth via Johannesburg. The flight from São Paulo to Johannesburg was okay with good service. Entertainment is poor due to the size of the TV monitor. The second flight from Johannesburg to Perth could have been better. The flight attendants served dinner quickly and soon all the lights were off although there was a lot of turbulence. The entertainment is really poor and the cabin layout is not very modern.

### "not a pleasant experience"
Johannesburg to Hong Kong. I am not having a pleasant experience due to this flight SA286. Boarding was on time but then, with all passengers on board, flight was delayed by almost an hour with sketchy explanations from the cabin crew to start. Eventually after simmering in the plane for too long, the pilot tells us that the reason why we haven't taken off is because it is too hot! Needs to be 27° to fly and it was still 28° - if it was too hot then I feel it is inhumane to load us in and make us wait in the sweltering plane for an hour before taking us on our 12 hour flight. Surely they could have explained that upfront and adjusted the boarding time accordingly? Then the inflight entertainment system was faulty, but luckily after 2 restarts equating to over another hour, it worked alright again for the rest of the trip. There is no cellphone charging for economy class - I thought that was standard these days, particularly if there was going to be the threat of no inflight entertainment. In the morning, one toilet sink was over-flowing. Approaching Hong Kong, they  had to apologise for the lack of arrival cards for passengers! Due to the delay, I have missed my connecting flight which was supposed to be at 2pm and can only go at 5.45pm now.

### "very uncomfortable flight"
Johannesburg to Hong Kong. Firstly, the service on the plane is atrocious. The hostesses ignore you or are very rude, they do not cater for special meals - if you are vegetarian there is a good chance you won't get a meal. Three quarter of the way into the flight they ran out of water. 30 minutes into our flight our screens were not working and we informed an air hostess who said it will be re set. We fell asleep and 8 hours into the flight our screens were still not working - should this not have been addressed and fixed as soon as we informed the air hostess it was not working? Also, my headphone jack was faulty. I told cabin staff and was informed by him that there is nothing he can do about it and walked away. It was a very uncomfortable flight and I would not recommend anyone to fly internationally with SAA.

### "best crew I’ve had to date"
Livingstone to Johannesburg. My 40th flight on SAA in the last 15 months or so, and I must say this was the best crew I’ve had to date. Flawless service, engaging purser, the Captain even made his announcement in German as there were Germans on board. SAA has challenges, but once up in the air, their service is consistently good, and a positive attitude from all the crew.

### "impressed with the service"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. I have not travelled on SAA for a while, and I was a bit apprehensive of using them having read some reports on this site. Check in was by machine in JNB. The first contact with SAA staff was in the JNB domestic lounge. Lounge facilities were fine, comfortable seating and good selection of refreshments on hand at the time of visit. (lunchtime) Boarding at the gate commenced slightly early, perhaps due to the bussing requirement to the remote stand where the aircraft was parked. On board staff advised that the aircraft was only 8 months old. After departure drinks and lunch were served, chicken or beef being the main course choice. Arrival in CPT was on time. Very impressed with the service on this short flight.

### "Happy to fly them again"
Perth to Johannesburg. My first time on South African Airways and returning to Africa after leaving 50 years ago. There is a saying 'TIA', This is Africa. So it proves with SAA in parts. The aircraft is well used. Old style armchair seating with ample legroom but pretty old. The IFE was vintage. A smooth flight over. The FA's were friendly but swift and once the meal service was done were not seen until the morning. No snacks during the night or anything like a midnight walk through. Get the PAX fed and to sleep was the motto. For a 11 hour flight it was fine but SAA lag behind likes of Qantas and the ME3 on long haul. Had a short haul SAA from Johannesburg to Cape Town and they were fine. Much like all other carriers. Happy to fly them again.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Munich to Johannesburg.Having read some recent reviews about SAA on Skytrax, I was a bit apprehensive about flying SAA. I booked Economy, but put in a bid for an upgrade to business and the offer was accepted. Business class configuration on the older A330-200 aircraft looks a bit dated, compared to the product on other airlines and newer aircraft, but the seat reclined to a 180 degrees flat seat. The bedding was comfortable. Lavatories were clean.The cabin crew was very attentive. Four meals options were available, with dessert and cheese selections. Wine selection from selection of South African vinyards.All meals served on porcellan. Breakfast is a choice of continental, full english, or fruit salad and cereals. Cabin lights were dimmed immediately after meal service, so that seats could be reclined for sleeping. Those who wanted breakfast were woken an hour before landing. On schedule arrival in JNB. All in all a very pleasant flight, even if the aircraft used was beginning to feel it's age a bit.

### "complaint remains unanswered"
Johannesburg to New York. During flight entertainment system was out of order which made this 15 hours journey extremely unpleasant. In addition air temperature in the cabin was very high and crew were unable to adjust it to the comfortable level. Looks like this aircraft if very old and never was refurbished. One can experience bad service, unpleasant situation, delay or break down during air travels. It happened to me on quite a few occasions but every time carrier involved responded to complain and at least apologised, promising improvements. Unfortunately this is not how SAA works. My complaint remains unanswered for over 2 months.

### "Cabin crews seemed efficient"
London to Harare via Johannesburg. Depart Heathrow on time, plane full to Johannesburg no spare seats. Served dinner then breakfast both of which were standard fare. Landed in Johannesburg on time then bussed to remote stand in Joburg - flight to Harare again plane full, served a hot brunch type meal and arrived on time. Cabin crews on both flights seemed efficient. Return flight from Harare to Johannesburg again full - SAA seem to fill their flights and yet manage to serve a meal on the 90 minute hop from Harare to Johannesburg. Johannesburg to London on another totally full flight, despite online booking and seat selection I was allocated a middle seat -complained at check in and ended up in an aisle seat at the back of the plane. Departed on time and evening meal served - a sort of tepid beef stew, after which all the blinds came down and lights turned off - announcement was "so that we can unwind and relax" but on the outward flight same procedure of blinds down "for security reasons" - translated these both mean dont bother the crew. Seats are hard and narrow so sleep is difficult. Breakfast served before arrival. To be fair they provide meals instead of cereal bars etc and this is appreciated .

### "I regret my choice"
New York to Johannesburg. South African Airways was not my first choice for this trip to New York. Based on my previous experiences with them, I had explored other alternatives with a superior product (Qatar, Emirates and several EU carriers), but SAA is the only airline serving JFK non stop out of Johannesburg and I could not afford traveling 1-2 days vs the 15h direct flight. Having flown to and back from New York with them last week, I regret my choice for the following reasons:  Airport services: OKish, uneventful check-in and boarding experience. SAA flies their old A340 600 to New York. Even though I purchased an emergency exit seat on both legs (45D, 45F resp) and had a very decent legroom, the experience was not pleasant as the seats were hard as a rock (even with lumbar support and additional pillows) and the aircraft clearly showed its age and it felt like its interior was falling apart. Inflight Entertainment more than half of the passengers travelling on my row complained about technical issues with their IFE system. Some of them simply didn't work, others like mine worked but with lag and poor sound. Not great when you have a 15h flight ahead of you. Cabin crew service: I did see a slight improvement vs. previous flights as crew seemed a bit nicer and more customer oriented. Don't think I would fly them again for such a long route again and will rather increase travel time by flying EU or Middle East carriers.

### "very unpleasant flight"
On flight SA 208 from Washington to Johannesburg we had the situation where the inflight entertainment did not work on my wife's seat (61G) after travelling the week before to JFK without any inflight entertainment for all passengers. The flight was full and the attendants could not move my wife to another seat. They were rude and unhelpful. During the night I only saw the attendant on duty came around with water once. A very unpleasant flight.

### "not even an apology since"
On Flight SA203 to JFK New York 21 June 2018  the entertainment etc was not working. Not only our family of five but all the passengers on the flight. The staff did not know how to resolve the problem, served dinner and vanished leaving one staff member in the galley who I did not see once came round to offer water. The staff emerged again for breakfast service and advised us to take the matter further with customer services from SAA. We reported the incident, got a reference number and not even an apology since.

### "nice flight overall"
London Heathrow to Gaborone via Johannesburg. Outbound A330-200 oldish aircraft with narrow uncomfortable seats - take a cushion - seats are hard. Plane was full. Had an aisle seat. Cabin crew efficient and evening meal was quite good - better than some airlines serving this route. Cabin crew virtually disappeared after evening meal but reappeared with breakfast 2 hours before landing. Again breakfast was good. Plane arrived late due to slightly late departure and traffic control strike over France. On to Gaborone with SA express - short hop and a bouncy landing. Return trip SA express from Gaborone to Johannesburg - Bombardier CJ70. On time. Depart Johannesburg Airbus 330-200, plane nearly full. Pilot announced that this aircraft was brand new - certainly seats were better than the outward flight - seemed more comfortable and a little more room. Had seat 62 C aisle seat. Evening meal did not match the outward flight - hake and rice and quite tepid. Breakfast again served - SAA serve two full meals per long flight, unlike some others where you get an evening meal and a cereal bar in the morning. Some of our local airlines take note! Landed on time and a nice flight overall.

### "They went out of their way to help"
Flew Johannesburg to London Heathrow. I have read many bad reviews of South African Airways so I was pleasantly surprised with our experience on board. Economy seats were comfortable, with sufficient legroom and recline. The only issue being the excessively stiff seat pocket. Anything thicker than a magazine is difficult to stow. On the flight to London we were given dinner and breakfast plus a good selection of drinks. Food choices were OK and if your choice was not in their cart the FA's were happy to find the meal in another cart if they could. They went out of their way to help. Service was generally very friendly, polite and efficient. Cabin crew seemed to be enjoying their job too, which makes a change from the sullen service on some European carriers. Inflight entertainment selections were a bit dated but OK. The major problem was sound quality. On this flight the movie voice soundtrack at my seat was completely garbled (though the music track was fine). Perhaps the different language tracks were interfering. As I mainly wanted to sleep on this overnight flight this was not a big loss. Overall I was satisfied by SAA's inflight service, it was way above expectation. Ground service at OR Tambo Airport is shockingly bad but that's another story.

### "there are no snacks on board"
Cape Town to London via Johannesburg. I will start with a few positives about the experience: The staff are personable and the meal service is conducted quickly to allow the maximum sleep time on the JNB-LHR route. Access is provided to an arrivals lounge, which is essential as the airlines serves only powdered coffee. Now for the many negatives, these relate primarily to the seat and to the airline's schedule instability. The aircraft was the advertised A330-200. These are widely marketed as lie-flats by the airline and independent websites, however they are angled at about 170 deg and uncomfortable for sleeping. SAA is rare in having a different Business Class seating product on each long-haul aircraft type and also unusual to go from the extremely comfortable and 2-metre long long lie-flats on the A340-600 back to an angled version. The schedule is unstable. I was booked on SA354 at 17.05. SAA did not inform either my travel agent or me of the change in flight plans, it was only by chance that I had wifi access and attempted an online check-in to notice we had been rebooked on SA346 at 15.00. This flight operates 2 hours earlier than our original booking. For much of our trip we were in the bush and off grid so would have missed the flight if we had been coming from elsewhere. This lack of communication of a significant flight change is terrible, as we would have missed the flight had we turned up for a 17.05 departure. On check-in it became apparent that the SA352 at 16.05 was cancelled and passengers being moved from SA352 to SA354. However, a 5-hour wait at JNB was not expected or particularly welcome and no attempt was made to move us to the earlier SA234 from JNB to LHR. Staff professionalism - staff chatted in the galleys throughout the night on both LHR flights, which disrupted sleep despite ear plugs. Furthermore, my request if a snack might be available before the breakfast service commenced, only to be told there are no snacks on board. Other airlines on similar flight lengths would at the very least be able to offer a pack of nuts or crackers.

### "very disappointed"
In September, 2017, I bought three tickets from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg for me, my girlfriend and her godson (12 years old). I informed, on the same day that I bought such tickets, that there was a little error in the passenger name, and I asked what would be the procedure in this case. It was a material and irrelevant error, I just had written his middle name with an extra “r”. In the e-mail dated 26 September 2017 sent by the Reservations Service Recovery team as described herein, they confirmed that the error in the name would not be a problem and also informed the occurance of a schedule change on our flight, as transcribed below: “Kindly be advised that we have endorsed on the system for the airport to allow passenger to board. Please note that there has been a schedule change on your flight from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg.” Unfortunately, on flight day when I tried to do the kid's check in at the airport, I was informed that his ticket was cancelled, although his seat was still booked in the system. We know that because I did my check in and my girlfriend's check in online one day before the flight and kid's seat was there. South African employee informed us that his ticket was cancelled, because the name was wrong and the company policy sets forth that the ticket must be automatically cancelled. However, I did not receive any e-mail about such cancellation. And also we confirmed five months ago with the company if the error in kid’s name would represent a problem and the answer was no, as I mentioned above. The employee at the airport said that the ticket was cancelled and refunded and she could not do anything about it. The wrong information of South African Airways employee, and the lack of cancelation notice cost us 3.281,89 Rand, almost four times more than the ticket that I originally paid for the kid to travel with us. I still want to understand why his ticket was cancelled and once cancelled why I did not receive a notice about it. We were on vacations and we booked two days in Sun City Hotel. So I did not have other choice than buy another ticket to the kid by a huge price. I look foward to their return. The ticket was arbitrarily cancelled. We were badlly guided by South African's team regarding the error in the kids name and the cancelation of his ticket. It cost us more 2.465,80 Rand. It is our first flight with SAA and we are very disappointed with the way that we have been treated by their employees since the beginning.

### "horrendous customer service"
George to Johannesburg. I have never encountered such horrendous customer service in my entire life. Our flight was delayed and then our bags “misplaced” for another 45 min, causing us to miss our international flight. South African airways did nothing to compensate us nor helped us rebook. I was directed to speak to a supervisor who then simply told me over and over again that they apparently have no responsibility to get us to our other flights on time. I will never fly this airline again, and I would recommend that they be avoided at all costs. It cost $8000 just to get home.

### "never set foot on SAA again"
I booked a flight for two people on SAA going from Cape Town to Mauritius via Johannesburg on airline website. Never have I had this happen and we travel out of country every 3 months on average. The first part of our vacation was spent in Cape Town. Using ET from LAX, we had no problems, very pleasant flight. Now were ready for our second city so its back to the airport to head out for Mauritius. The SAA counter looks at my passport and says," You can't leave the country on this ticket". Why? This is not your ticket. Your Passport says Gregory but your ticket says Greg". I tried to explain to her this is very common for Americans to shorten names. She say," Your Ticket much match your Passport Exactly" . I wanted to say, with that logic my GF can't fly either because her ticket doesn't have her middle name as does her passport but I thought better. They told me I had to cancel my ticket and buy one from them. I said, how can I cancel someone else's ticket? what If "Greg" shows up, since you people think Im not Greg? The lady didn't appreciate that lol. They ended up charging me 800USD to go from Cape Town to Mauritius. I was stuck. The sales counter even had the nerve to ask, what about your return flight, aren't you going to buy it now? I said, I worried about that in Mauritius. I believe this is a legal scam they pull to shake down customers. The sales lady say had i bought my original tickets on "Their" website, they would have just issued me a new ticket no charge. Forgive me if I don't believe. Once in Mauritius, I called my ticket broker and they said because i was a "No show" on the first leg of the flight, my return ticket was cancel and they couldn't update my name in the system. I decided to buy two new return tickets. Needless to say, I will never set foot on an SAA aircraft again. Lesson learned.

### "was a huge disappointment"
Johannesburg to Hong Kong. SAA was a huge disappointment for my daughter and myself. The seats and TV screens were dirty. The selection of movie were old and outdated. They hostess informed us they have run out of certain drinks on the first service order. When all the lights were shut down in cabin I assume that means we can all have a nap but it was impossible, the staff never stopped talking, this went on for hours. We would like to support our local airline but after this flight will rethink my future travel decision.

### "consistently excellent service"
East London to London via Johannesburg. Huge credit to SAA for providing a consistently excellent service onboard and on the ground. For passengers departing South Africa to Europe and many other routes, they have an amazing deal for excess baggage with an extra 3 bags allowed at 450 ZAR per bag (just over GBP20) compared to KQ, BA and ET all charging 7 times that - a massive advantage for long term residents travelling heavy. Good entertainment and (three) nice meal choices, with unlimited, quality alcohol throughout the overnight flight to London and also on the short domestic flights continue to set them apart. Don't expect never ending smiles from young staff, but this is part of the appeal. Very sad to hear SAA are pulling out of East London next year. We experienced some hectic storms on both journeys, but both pilots kept passengers updated and transfer at ORT was efficient.

### "administrative fees for cancellation"
After many years travelling with South African Airways I must say that I had the most horrible customer care experience of my life. Another bad experience was some years ago and it was again with SSA, so this time I promise myself that I will never fly again with this airline and strongly recommend to avoid them. After request of cancellation of 4 tickets for very serious health problems with 2 month notice communicated to the airline company we received a feedback that administrative fees for cancellation were amounting to almost the total of what we had paid for our tickets. A real shock. In the same occasion the other airline company with which we had booked another segment of the trip refunded us against a minor cancellation fee.

### "filthiest plane I have ever been on"
❎ Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Durban. Flight was on time, no great shakes for a 50 minute domestic flight. A drink and a sandwich severed during the flight. However - this must have been the filthiest plane I have ever been on and I have been on hundreds. The dirt, grim and filth on the table and seats was beyond a joke.

### "most of the time above average"
❎ Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Lusaka. To be fair, most of the time SAA flights are above average. This time round was not one of them. My Qatar Airways flight was delayed in Doha, I spent over two hours on my mobile trying to change my flight for the next day, can't wait to see the bill, and nothing was resolved. I spoke to four different people, each time having to start at the beginning of my story, only to be told I have to visit an SAA office. Pretty hard when you are in Doha and they don't have an office there. At the end it cost me the same price as the ticket to have it changed once I got to Johannesburg airport. Once on board we taxied to the runway only to turn back and park for close on three hours due to a technical fault - we were not allowed to disembark. As I said, to be fair, this is the first delay I have encountered after 40 or so flights.

### "Flight Attendants very friendly"
SA378, 11 Oct 17, Cape Town to Johannesburg. Nice presentation + ample food. Scrambled eggs tasted like powdered eggs - bland, the rest was tasty. May I suggest that Cabin Services introduces warm bread-rolls on all its flights (Domestic, Regional and International) which is almost standard on all Asian carriers and on BA International. Its the little attention to detail that passengers appreciate. Nothing worse than eating fridge cold bread wrapped in a plastic packet. Check In staff in CPT not overly friendly or welcoming - maybe because of the 04H30 check in? Flight Attendants very friendly. Purser was very attentive. New interior on A320 beautiful. SA190 / 11 Oct 17, Johannesburg to Mauritius. Lunch meal (Fish option) was bland, boring, lacking in flavour and colour. Cold bread roll as above. Lots of drinks on offer. Flight attendants on this flight friendly. Lady Purser was super friendly. One attractive YC FA was abrupt, unsmiling and didn't look like she enjoyed her job. Also noticed many elderly and over-weight crew? Does SAA still apply the BMI weight to height ratio as some airlines? Aircraft A340-300 cabin looked tired with old unresponsive PTV's and in need of refurbishment. Glad it was only a 3H30m flight. SA191 / 22 Oct, Mauritius to Johannesburg. Dinner service (Chicken option). Very nice (warm bread roll would have added an extra touch). Entire crew on this flight very professional and friendly, especially the Business Class stewardess who went out of her way to talk to and offer my American seat mates on honeymoon (New York bound on SAA that night) a bottle of MCC champagne. They were super impressed and the lady is a true asset to SAA. New A320 interior very attractive. SA375 / 22 Oct, Johannesburg to Cape Town. Dinner service (Chicken curry option). Excellent meal and yummy dessert. Very bland and boring starter. No bread roll with this meal which was OK. Same friendly Purser as on SA378 / 11 0ct 17. Male crew member serving Business Class had a great sense of humour. This crew worked as a Team, with all four crew members helping each other in YC. Old A320 cabin looked tired. All boarding Gate staff were friendly in CPT, JNB and MRU.

### "crew we had made all the difference"
I fly South African Airways fairly regularly, but I must say SA77, Windhoek to Johannesburg, 12 Sep topped it. The crew we had on this flight made all the difference. Well coordinated, a CSD that had the flight and crew firmly under control, anticipated client needs well and had a good sense of humour. Good job SAA.

### "don't care about customers"
SAA is randomly putting me and my wife in terrible seats, even if I have previously booked my seats. It's my fifth trip with SAA this year, 4 from and to Sao Paulo and Johannesburg, and today we are flying from JNB to Mauritius and the same situation happened again. They just don't care about customers, if the flight is empty, they just cancel the flight and put the customers from 2 or 3 empty flights in one full flight, giving random seats to me and my wife, and you just say that flight is full. I was previously checked in seats 14D and 14E, which was 3rd row in the aircraft map; and my new boarding pass is row 71, because the computer randomly put me in row 47 in between 2 other people. And the excuse is the same, that the flight was cancelled, but you can check same flight number in both boarding passes. It is not the first time, and the other times were far worse, because when we buy from partner airlines, you don't even give the option to choose the seat, even if you call SAA or the partner airline.

### "Really impressive service"
East London to London via Johannesburg. Really impressive service on SAA to deal with a late departure on a domestic flight by an hour with an already tight connection onto a long haul flight from Johannesburg. On boarding and making the cabin crew aware of my concern, they smiled and reassured that I would make it no problem. This was confirmed when the captain announced during his pre-take-off message that he was aware of a passenger connecting to London, (and some others onto Munich), that he had alerted this to the ground staff in Johannesburg, and that there would be staff waiting at the gate on arrival to whisk us through to the connecting flights - exactly that happened! It was a pleasure to see everything work as promised, and took the stress out of a worrying situation. SAA must be commended (somehow despite their near bankruptcy - but that is another story!) for offering generous food and alcohol (giving two bottles of wine instead of one; two liqueur miniatures etc) on their flights - a notable contrast to their two competitors Virgin and BA on this route where cost cutting is so obvious. Cooked breakfast and three dinner options still offered, and flight attendants that enjoy their jobs and want to serve their customers. Only gripe was on boarding on the return at LHR, five people were struggling to locate their seats (a family had been split up across the totally full plane), and no staff were present or visible to assist - they all were in the galley before takeoff chatting, and when I went back to let them know if someone could assist they looked irritated... Small blemish though on 4 very good flights. My luggage on the return was not on the belt in Johannesburg - after a worrying 15 minutes, the baggage enquiries desk confirmed it had mistakenly been transferred onto my next flight, and it was there at my final destination. Keep in up SAA!

### "Airline changed seating"
Johannesburg to Maun. Callous treatment of 78 year olds disabled persons needing walking canes. Booked tickets 9 months ago to select seats 6A/B. Airline changed seating over time even after gaining boarding pass to end up in the last 2 double seats in plane with no overhead locker. Requested pre boarding but only got pre boarding onto bus. Staff at bottom of stairs to the plane refused to help with hand luggage as "passengers are supposed to carry on the own hand luggage". Ended up last passengers on plane with overhead lockers full and ours filled with emergency equipment, Cabin staff and the back door refused to help as she could not leave her position, so ended up with very cramped seating.

### "quite modern and comfortable"
New York JFK to Johannesburg. Cabin staff was an absolute pleasure, attentive and very professional. The business class cabin is quite modern and comfortable, I'd rate the food pretty okay, so I'll definitely be flying SAA more frequently, although I'd really appreciate some wifi connectivity - it's 2017 SAA.

### "headaches and hassles"
I greatly regretted booking my flight from New York to Madagascar on South African Airways. While this was the most direct route, the headaches and hassles associated with South African's booking system and web services were extensive. As a result, we spent hours trying to do such simple tasks as obtain seats, and had to spend 2 lengthy sessions on the phone with customer service, only to arrive at JFK with the problems unresolved. It is a pity that one of the leading carriers of Africa cannot run a basic website. They claimed our credit cards had been declined but on checking with the bank, there was an ample credit line and no record of any related transaction. Nor was the information concerning excess baggage relevant or accurate. Way too stressful a way to approach a 20 hour journey. Two thumbs down.

### "cannot get better on a domestic flight"
There are only 2 airlines flying within South Africa that have Business Class: BA on old B737s and South African Airways on multiple types of aircrafts. Between Cape Town and Johannesburg, I always choose SA because a lot of flights are on wide body jets. On this trip, I was lucky to get a brand new A330, with the new lie-flat business configuration. It cannot get better on a domestic flight: full bar, 3 course meal, and very private seating. The crew provided a great service and were very proud of the new aircraft.

### "so disappointed with SAA"
Perth to Cape Town via Johannesburg. I am so disappointed with SAA, I will never fly with them again. Horrible customer service and even worse I was not seated in a row with the kids (3 kids), thankfully I was changed after kicking up a storm and refusing to sit through a 13 hr flight with 3 seats and someone sitting next to us in the row as well. They eventually told me that I had to pre select the seats although every time I went online it said seating to be selected 3 hours prior to departure. when we arrived to Johannesburg we missed our connecting flight to Cape Town because the flight was delayed in Perth, we had to wait 7 Hours for the next flight because there were no seats, and then to top it off we were offered nothing in the way of the guest lounge or food vouchers. It was actually beyond ridiculous. On the way back we arrived to Melbourne only to be told all our luggage had been misplaced and they had no idea where it was. We received our luggage 2 days later, it was left outside of our house. Also whilst on all of the flights my 5 yr old daughter got nothing to eat. The agent never requested a child's meal which I understand that was his mistake although they didn't even offer my child an adult meal, on every single flight they had nothing for her, why they didn't request the child's meal after the first flight I have no idea. They also gave my nearly 2 year old food for a 6 month old for the infant food. My travel agent has requested an explanation from SAA and so far (after 2 months) have only said sorry and attached their terms of conditions which don't answer a thing as their explanation. The travel agent is offering us a store credit as he feels bad about what has happened.

### "flight has been very disappointing"
Johannesburg to Durban. I have always preferred using South African Airways for flights within South Africa but this flight has been very disappointing. I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter alone and coming after a night with very little sleep and a day of continuous flying a flight on time would have been much appreciated, but that was not to be we stood in line at the embarkation gate for over half an hour with no explanation on the delay and no estimated time of departure. My little one needed to go toilet and I tried to get any information on the tine without an answer so I had to get her out of line and take her to toilet losing or spot and ending up at the back of the line. When we board I find out that we had been seated separately and not one of the flight attendants tried to explain to passengers to help us sit together the little girl was crying quietly seated next to a strange woman. I will think twice about flying on this airline again.

### "the food was great"
I flew with South African Airways on the 13 January 2017, from Perth to Johannesburg. The staff looked smart and they were friendly. The seats looked old and dirty, but had decent legroom. The food was great. The IFE wasn't too good. The headphones were very tight and the one side wasn't working.

### "seats in business class are worn"
Windhoek to Hong Kong via Johannesburg. As SAA Voyager member of many years I find that my miles and being a member of this club hold very little to no privileges. This is reflective in how hard it is to even contact somebody at the airline as the phones just ring - I have to employ a travel agent to do this. The bad experience already starts in Biz Class Lounge in JNB - hopelessly overfilled, poor selection of food and drinks and they run out of ice. No departure anouncements. We get onto the aircraft, we find that my wife's seat belt installed incorrectly very much to her discomfort which they could not fix. The electronics in my seat played up which they could not fix either. On the flight to Hong Kong the temprature setting was far too high and cabin staff ignored the request to lower it. The food selection was bland and of very poor quality. No selection of newpapers or magazine - the racks remained empty on both flights. On the return flight my inflight entertainment system broke down in the middle of the movie I was watching. They could not fix. Overall the seats in business class are worn and and the same applies to the blankets and bed mat that cabin crew hand out. After dinner service the Cabin Crew is nowhere to be seen  - when I went behind the galley where the door to the cockpit is siuated I actually found a signboard which read "Silence Cabin Crew resting". The airline has been plagued by politcal interference, lack of funding and management - this has also become clearly evident in the passenger flying experience.

### "had the worst customer experience"
I have flown with SAA every year for the last 3 years between London and Johannesburg, and I am normally pretty relaxed with not having the best travel arrangement as I know things happen and go wrong, and you can’t blame the airline. But 3 flights in a row I have had the worst customer experience, and what pushed it over the edge was my flight being cancelled 2 days before Christmas. They knew the flight would not take off from Heathrow when I checked in at 5pm but checked all their passengers in without telling them the flight had been cancelled, and only when they were at the gate ready to board did they inform everyone the flight was cancelled. They gave us an empty promise of EU compensation which they fully knew didn’t apply to the situation we were in, which we all found out afterwards when we tried to receive compensation for the delay. If they had told me when I had checked in at 5pm I could have made alternative arrangement to fly back to SA without missing my connection flight, but they made sure we were all checked in and couldn’t catch any other flights out and only told us the flight was cancelled at 8:30pm. Long story short it was shocking customer service, with very little help and assistance, and ended up costing me £300+ extra to pay for accommodation and changing flights to get home on Christmas day, more than a day later then I should have arrived home. SAA have taken no accountability for the lack of service and communication and refuse to reimburse me for part of my costs incurred. I have been a loyal SAA voyager member for over 20 years, as I want to support my home airline. But I can quite honestly say I will never fly SAA again. And for the amount of money paid for the tickets the quality of the aircraft, service and food is acceptable. I paid £1500 to fly economy, with a TV that didn’t work, food that was disgusting, no charging dock for my phone, and a very disappointing before and after customer service.

### "thanks to the outstanding crew"
Early morning flight from Dakar to Johannesburg. The aircraft came from Washington, and a new crew took over. The seats are beginning to show their age, but are still very comfortable (they provide you with a mattress, a duvet and an oversized pillow). The configuration was 2-2-2, but I heard that in the new aircrafts it is 1-2-1. The crew did a fantastic job, especially during the emergency landing in Accra to evacuate a passenger who had a stroke. They were very professional and friendly. However, as usual, the meals are nothing special and SAA should really look at the quality of their catering. Overall, a great flight thanks to the outstanding crew.

### "as usual the service was rushed"
Overall, a pretty good flight from Johannesburg to Dakar, although the seats were old (first seat did not recline, second seat the audio was not working, and the third seat was finally OK). However, they are very comfortable and a mattress and duvet are provided. The crew were very friendly, but as usual the service was rushed: five minutes after serving the cocktails, they showed up with the starter, followed by the main dish another 5 minutes later, it would be nice if they would let the customers relax, especially if the business cabin is less than half full and the flight departed at 7pm. On an 8.5 hour flight, no second service was provided which is poor. Was it worth the €2500 fare? No. The friendliness of the crew and the amarula saved the experience on SAA.

### "avoid OR Tambo International Airport"
South Africa is a wonderful destination if you avoid OR Tambo International Airport, Johannesburg. SAA staff, particularly in the business class lounge, were rude and incompetent. They could not explain the layout of the airport, an important skill one would assume when the airport has no maps and the point of departure for Flight SAA 280 changed back and forth from Gate A15 to A01 to A18, a journey of several hundred metres through and around retail outlets. After several delays we were allowed to board the aircraft only to discover that the baggage handlers had loaded the stowage bins for the forward compartment into the rear of the aircraft and vice versa, not a comfortable mistake when the aircraft is facing a 10 hour flight over the Indian Ocean. The skipper explained to the hot, tired and thirsty passengers that the reshuffling of the containers would take 10 minutes, in fact it took 40, and to add insult the only in-flight entertainment was a tumbling kaleidoscope of photographs, projected on small screens, of apparently happy and competent ground staff.

### "seats were comfortable and seat pitch was great"
JNB-VFA-CPT. Not problem of the airline but getting through immigration at JNB is a hustle. Airplanes were clean and new. Going to VFA we had 20 min delay and returning we had 1 hour and half delay. Service was good and if you ask they bring you pillow and blanket. Food was great also, in the international and in the domestic service. E-check in was 24 hours before flight time but in the domestic flight you could not change seat selection. Seats were comfortable and seat pitch was great. Overall a good experience.

### "my worst business class experience"
Perth to Johannesburg with South African Airways was my worst business class experience. Seating ordinary and food diabolical with no real choice. 11 hour flight and no snacks available, despite raising the issue twice. Unfortunately I have a return flight booked in a few weeks. Not looking forward to it.

### "revive belief in the joy of flying"
Durban to Johannesburg. South African Airways aircraft might be a bit older but they are clean and comfortable. Ground staff seem knowledgeable and friendly, while flight crew are courteous and quite personable. Food is a bit amateurish, but what do you expect from short domestic flights? For someone like me, who correlates domestic flying to a form of torture due to years of flying with airlines in the US, SAA will revive your belief in the joy of flying, regardless if they are domestic or international flights.

### "worst customer service imaginable"
New York JFK to Harare return via Johannesburg. One of the worst travelling experiences I've ever had. On my leg from JFK to Johannesburg , the entertainment system on my seat was not working. I had to spend the flight with no TV while everyone else around me enjoyed their entertainment systems. When asked, the air hostess stated she had attempted to reset the system but failed and since she was not an engineer, there was nothing else she could do. I asked if I could be moved to different seat, but that could not be accommodated. One my flight back to JFK, the airline lost 1 of my 2 suitcases. The suitcase literally vanished into thin air and has not been able to be traced. I called the airline for 2 weeks straight with no one able to give any information regarding my bag. I literally called SAA at least 50 times, each time getting a different service agent who was less helpful than the last. This trip was an absolute nightmare - I'm still missing my luggage and have not been compensated for it. Not a single person from SAA has contacted me and they have the worst customer service imaginable.

### "positives offset the negatives"
New York to Johannesburg with South African Airways. The legroom on our 15 hour flight was excellent. The crew were the friendliest I have experienced. The flight left and arrived on time. On the southbound flight, the audio was not working, the window had so much condensation I was unable to enjoy the views and the window shade was filthy. However the route map kept me entertained. We were well fed. A generous lunch; stroganoff, pasta salad, cheese, cheesecake and a snickers bar. Excellent. Halfway a smoked chicken sandwich and a pre-landing cheese pancake breakfast with fruit, yoghurt and a croissant. The positives offset the negatives and the time passed by. I was able to sleep a little. Overall, I enjoyed the flight and the fact that we flew nonstop. We saved over 10 hours by doing so. On our return flight, the entertainment worked on my row but not in the row behind me where my friend was sitting. Also a wonderful friendly crew. We left on time and arrived 40 minutes early. I enjoyed both flights and was impressed by the legroom, the food and the crews. However flying out of Johannesburg, they are fussy with luggage weight. We were 2.5 kilos overweight on one suitcase and the check in agent made a fuss about it asking me why I had so much stuff. When I told her I would pay for the excess luggage she told me she did not know how to calculate the extra fee. She told me I would be excused this time.

### "to date, silence prevails"
Perth to Johannesburg flying on 1 September 2016 was cancelled and chaos followed; no-one at the airline knew what was going on. Eventually we were told that we would be checked in at a hotel for the night. We had to cart our luggage for the best part of 500 metres to wait for the bus in the cold of the night. We waited for 45 minutes. Naturally, as the substitute flight did not take off until 1600hrs the next day, we lost our connection to Cape Town and one night accommodation at the Table Bay Hotel at the Waterfront. In addition we lost half a day's tour of Cape Town. The worst part is that we had pre-paid for our seats as we wanted to have a window and aisle seat at a cost of AUD$66. When we checked in on the substitute flight to Johannesburg we were allocated the middle seats - the very ones we were trying to avoid originally. We complained to SAA by sending several e-mails to its customer service from 28 September 2016 but to date, silence prevails. The mission statement of SAA was that it cared for its customers first and foremost. We certainly do not believe in it.

### "strongly advise to avoid SAA"
Windhoek to Johannesburg (SA73) with South African Airways in economy (Star Alliance Gold member). I experienced the most appalling behaviour of a flight purser in 40 years of travelling by air. Despite the fact that the cabin was less than half empty, this employee offended not only me but a myriad of other passengers by not even considering using her discretion to allow a second piece of hand luggage (consisting of expensive camera equipment) onboard. This resulted in a major inconvenience, as I had to – instead of remaining in transit - go through immigration in Johannesburg (a queue miles long), pick up my second hand luggage from the carousel, go through immigration and security again (another mile queue) to catch my connecting flight to Nairobi (SA184) at such a tight timeframe that I almost missed it. In the light of this experience I, as a frequent and mostly premium class traveller (Star Alliance Gold and OneWorld Platinum/Emerald) and travel agent, will not only no longer consider SAA for any of my future travels, but as the owner of a travel agent I will also strongly advise all my clients to avoid flying SAA.

### "the service was excellent"
Johannesburg to Durban. The service was really good, it was my first time flying business class and the purser was fabulous. It wasn't the new A320's as I had expected but it was really comfortable and clean, they had a option of continental breakfast or a fruit platter which looked really good but I just wanted something to drink as I just got off another flight. Left ahead of schedule and arrived early. Short flight, but the service was excellent and boarding was really fast and the gate staff was friendly.

### "service was really great"
Johannesburg to Dar Es Salaam return. From time of boarding until we landed on both legs service was really great. I was lucky enough to have a row to myself but seats and leg room very comfortable and I am not a small person. Food was standard economy class fare but not unpalatable. FA's were excellent with service throughout the whole flight and had some very difficult passengers to deal with. I would fly again on SAA.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Easily the worst airline I have flown. My flight from JFK to Johannesburg was fine. Food was airline food. Seats were uncomfortable, but I flew economy so can't complain too much. The worst was I landed in Johannesburg and customs took 2 hours. SAA only booked me for a 2 hour layover before I would have to fly to Cape Town. I also asked customs and it usually takes at least 1.5 hours to get through customs. I ran to baggage where they told me they would hold the flight for me. When I arrived at the gate, the plane was gone. After I missed my flight I went to customer service to get the next flight out, but they would not change my ticket for free. They charged me over $600 for a new ticket. Obviously I was furious when I was told this happens all the time. It's a scam. The original flight is cheaper because they know you won't make it through customs in time, then you will have to buy a new ticket at 5x the cost. To make things worse, as I was getting my bags, I got talking to a person in line, and he told me he was on my two flights and SAA changed his tickets for free. The only difference between us was our skin complexion. Since I has already bought my $600 ticket to Cape Town, it wasn't worth making a stink at that point. I figured I'd enjoy my vacation then voice my opinion. Moral of the story, do not let SAA give you a 2 hour layover if you have to go through customs.

### "have noticed drastic decline in customer service"
Firstly the flight SA237 on 6 October London to Johannesburg was cancelled due to technical faults. Check in counters were not open, and each staff member gave passengers different information. Some passengers luggage was booked in, some not. Some given boarding passes for connecting flights some not. Eventually we were sent off to the Sofitel Hotel. Told to be back at 6.00am, only to find 2 SAA staff on duty. The flight departed late SA9237. Breakfast was served, then crisps but no beverages about 4pm and dinner at 7.30pm. We arrived in JHB too late for connecting flights, to be met by rude, impatient SAA ground staff at OR Tambo. No customer service here. My luggage had not even left LHR. Sent off to the Premier Hotel, which needs a serious upgrade. We arrive back at OR Tambo the Saturday morning and SAA check in counter staff did not know anything about "extra" connecting passengers. Then we eventually board the flight JHB to CT, SA323. We sit in the plane for 55 minutes after scheduled take off time, before the captain announces a delay due to conveyer belt in domestic terminal not working, emphasising that it is ACSA's fault not SAA. I eventually get to Cape Town on Saturday afternoon without my luggage. SAA make contact on Saturday informing me that the luggage will leave LHR on Sunday night. I called CT airport Monday and collected it Monday evening. I fly the CT-JHB-LHR return route every 6 weeks and have noticed drastic decline in customer service and also the tardy state of aircraft. My inflight entertainment had no sound. I have flown British Airways 3 this year and was very happy with service, so even though I want to support the National carrier, SAA you making the choice for me.

### "one of the most miserable flights"
Johannesburg to London Heathrow. This was one of the most miserable flights I have ever taken. The aircraft looked run down, my IFE had no sound (so, in essence, I could play solitaire for the 11 hour flight) and the apparatus under my seat that contained the life vest kept falling onto my legs. Combine that with terrible food (I took Delta over to South Africa and the food blew SAA's away) and a 2 hour delay due to a faulty wing light, change in runway usage and ATC delays because "too many planes were headed north from JNB" (which other direction do most flights from JNB go?) and I was not pleased. Plus the use of remote stands for too many flights made the "basement" gates at JNB overcrowded - not a pleasant experience. Will avoid SAA for future long haul routes. Cabin crew was OK except they did not comet through the aisles at all overnight with water or anything and then one FA in particular put his arm up to prevent economy passengers from deplaning before "premium" passengers (his word) even though we were 2 hours late and most people (myself included) had very, very tight connections to try and make in LHR.

### "customer service is non-existent"
Livingstone to Johannesburg. The customer service is not just poor - it is non-existent. I have been trying to make a simple request to locate a lost article but this seems beyond the capability of SAA to even direct me to the right department. I have spend hours and not insignificant money on international calls to SAA and they keep just passing me on to another department who often denies it is their responsibility or they simply never answer the phone. Their Customer Service phone number results is a very very long menu system where none of the options are what I want. And choosing one of the option results in no answer. This is an appalling company - if you need to contact their Customer Service - forget it - they are useless.

### "old, uncomfortable planes"
As a family we travelled from London to Cape Town via Johannesburg return with SAA. We live in the UK, but thought we would support our home country's air carrier. Never again! Delays all round for us and I have heard many other complaints regarding delays with SAA. Not enough meals were provided (had to make do with vegetarian option). Why are old, uncomfortable planes used for long-haul flights? In-flight entertainment sound quality very poor so had very boring flights. I must add that the ground crew and on-board SAA crew were very helpful and it's a pity that they are so good and the airline itself is so bad. Taking away the direct flight from London to Cape Town makes it a very tiring commute. Why was this done? And to top it all I received an email from SAA asking for a review. I filled it in, but when I tried to send it I got this message "error occured". From now on I will use British Airways.

### "good service and inflight entertainment"
I travel from New York JFK to Johannesburg at least once a year. For the last 10 trips I have flown non-stop with South African Airways. We usually travel in a group of 4 people. This has proven to be the best flight, with comfortable seats, good service and inflight entertainment. The staff has always been available to help, whether with late night food, extra pillows, a change of seats etc. We have tried 2 other airlines who fly this route, but SAA is the best.

### "flight attendants were miserable"
Johannesburg to London with South African Airways. The flight was excellent, the inflight entertainment was good and even the food was acceptable. However, the flight attendants were the most miserable bunch I've ever met. I was sat next to one as I had an exit row. I smiled and said hello when they first came to their seat and got no response. Even later in the flight when they came back, I got nothing. I presume something must have gone wrong for them - they did all look exceptionally tired. It's a shame as other SA Airways flights were good with no staff issues.

### "cancelled due to technical issues"
Johannesburg to Frankfurt with South African Airways. After checking in for this flight, the 279 passengers were informed it was delayed to the next morning at 07:00h. All passengers were managed by 3 employees of SAA. We were put up in the Southern Sun Hotel. Airport Shuttle has a 14 seat capacity. By the team I reached Frankfurt at 18:00h the following day my transatlantic connection to Toronto was long gone. I was put up in the airport hotel in Frankfurt and rebooked to Canada the next morning. Reached Sudbury after a 60h trip. On the same trip, my return flight SA208 Washington to Johannesburg was also cancelled due to technical issues. I was rebooked with British Airways via London - by that time SAA must have realized that they are not able to fly passengers - never again.

### "entertainment system didn't work"
London Heathrow to Johannesburg with South African Airways for the first time. The entertainment system didn't work the whole journey (11hrs flight), the food had no choice by the time it got to my row, it was very cold. I normally travel with Emirates as last minute booking but I thought I would try South African which has left me completely in shock. I paid a lot of money for this service and the same problem on my way back to London. Very disappointed and would never use again.

### "seating was comfortable"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. Boarding was not good. Very steep stairs and no control by staff. Seating was comfortable. Drinks were nice. I was surprised that some passengers were given 3-4 small bottles of wine each. Food was nice. Disembarking was quick. Cabin staff were a bit abrupt and showed annoyance with some passengers. What puzzled me was how people ignored warnings about mobile phone use and kept using them during takeoff and landing. No communication from the cockpit and a brief announcement by cabin staff just saying thank you for flying with this airline. In the safety briefing they left it up to the video which did not show me where the nearest exit was.

### "dishonest about our connection"
Flight was booked through an agent for Lufthansa operated by SAA. We arrived at Johannesburg Airport for our flight only to discover it was cancelled and re-scheduled for the following morning, but cannot blame SAA as they apparently communicated with the agent who did not inform us. I must commend SAA for the hotel booking at the airport overnight. The next morning we checked in and asked about our connecting flight from Germany which was operated by another airline and we were informed it was not yet booked but we will find out in Germany as an agent from SAA will be waiting on the ground. However, on arrival it was not the case and found our way to Lufthansa service desk where we were assisted. Upon enquiry about the connecting flight we were told that SAA booked us on flight that departed at 2pm the same day yet they were very much aware that their flight would arrive at 6pm. The next connecting flight was only available the next day at 11am - yet another night we had to spend. This time on airport chairs and cabins without showers - very uncomfortable night as non could book at a hotel as we required visa's to leave the airport. I was fortunate to be allowed to go out on an emergency visa due to a condition but I had to leave my husband behind at the airport. My disappointment is directed at the manner in which SAA was dishonest about our connection in Germany even after we took the initiative to enquire before departure in RSA as we would have elected to board an overnight flight rather than being stranded in another country and left on our own. This non disclosure of our connection also affected other arrangements we had initially booked at our destination for both accommodation and other flights since Washington was not our final destination.

### "an overall tacky feel to it"
Flew Johannesburg to London Heathrow. The service on South African Airways flights is always pretty good and I cannot find a reason to fault them on that. Even on other flights I've found the staff to be friendly and attentive. The food is nothing to write home about, but its not the worst I've had and it was a pleasant experience. Where it starts to come undone however, is the equipment/aicraft. The A340 feels like it came out of the 90s. The decor is old, the seats are old and it just has an overall tacky feel to it. The LCD (if it was even LCD) screens are so old they're tiny little squares with black lines where the "touch" sensors are. Its a pity because the flight was smooth, and service good but it was let down by equipment that should really have been removed and upgraded LONG ago.

### "crew could not care less"
Johannesburg - Abuja return on South African Airways A330-200 for both flights. After booking managing the booking online is a task as SAA webtool is not the easiest to manage. Check in staff at JNB very cold and could not care less this was at Premium Counters. Lounge at JNB good. Good selection of food and friendly staff. Boarding swift and flight departed on time. Probably helped by the fact that load was around 25% in both Y and J. Crew barring the Pursuer in Y extremely rude and disinterested. A reasonable meal served. Arrived in time into ABV. ABV Airport another story. Return, check in a mess. More to do with the mess in Nigeria on the whole. Same crew operating the return flight. Pursuer recognised me and gave a warm welcome. This was the highlight of trip. Again very poor load. Crew could not care less. IFE and food reasonable. On time arrival into JNB. SAA a good airline but being messed by staff at all levels. A sad story.

### "cannot fault the service"
London Heathrow to Johannesburg with South African Airways. Smooth check-in facilitated by a courteous and friendly agent. Boarding was orderly and quick. On board, the aircraft was showing its age with worn interior. Flight took off on time and service was prompt. The agent looking after my side of business class was warm, attentive and clearly enjoying her job. Food was tasty and well presented with a large variety of beverages on offer. The seat was fairly comfortable although it was not 100% lie-flat in the sleep position. The IFE was disappointing with a limited selection of new releases so I opted for sleep and got about 7 hours of it. Prior to landing a nice breakfast with fruit, yogurt, cereal and a hot main was offered. The flight landed on time and my bag was waiting for me in a designated priority luggage area by the time I got to the carousel. Aside from the IFE, I cannot fault the service and quality.

### "in need of an upgrade"
Johannesburg to Perth with South African Airways. The check-in was quick using the priority service lane although the agent seemed only remotely interested in looking after premium customers. The lounge was crowded and felt stuffy. The bathrooms were not very clean and appeared to lack attention. My seat change request was met by a rather surly gate agent who simply told me to ask for it when I got on the aircraft. On board the aircraft interior looked in need of an upgrade. The seat was comfortable in the upright position but offered poor support when converted into a bed. The service was rushed and lacked warmth. The dinner was bland and my fish was overcooked to the point of being bone-dry. The IFE had a decent choice of movies and I liked the feature showing the view through a tail-mounted camera. The flight left and arrived on time but was unremarkable in terms of FA's service.

### "seats were terribly cramped"
My family and I booked this flight from New York to Johannesburg months in advance, taking great care choosing our seats in exit rows and of course paying extra for the added legroom. Our seats were terribly cramped, especially by the window, where the metal seat belt strap dug into our hips. It was ridiculous. We are slender people and we were very uncomfortable. Two out of our four TV monitors were broken, so it meant 15 hours in the air with nothing to watch. The flight attendants were horrible - extremely rude and cold. The lights were turned off in order to allow sleep over the night-time flight, but the attendants stormed through the cabin throughout the night shining flashlights on the passengers to make sure no one was breaking their rules. The food was average airline food - edible at best. I will never fly South African Airways again.

### "seats were comfortable"
Flew South African Airways. Check-in and boarding for Accra-Johannesburg went smoothly. The seats were comfortable with enough legroom given the class travelled (2-4-2 configuration). Choice of movies was decent. The hot lunch (choice of chicken with rice or beef with potato) on this day flight was average and what can be expected of airplane food. Flight attendants came round once to serve lunch and that was it. On a 5 1/2 hour flight one would expect another drink and snack offered before landing. Flight attendants were in a rush to serve the food and were abrupt, with no smiles and not showing any interest in the passengers, to the point of being absolutely rude when asked a question as if it was an infringement of their precious time. Once the lunch was served, the flight attendants disappeared for the remainder of the flight. This in great contrast to the attitude of the flight attendants on the 55 minute connecting domestic Johannesburg-Durban flight, who were under much more time pressure to go round with snacks and drinks yet did their job with friendly smiles and enthusiasm. Seats on this flight (3-3 configuration) were comfortable with enough legroom). Quick luggage delivery at both arrivals in Johannesburg and Durban and easy re-check-in at Johannesburg. Pity though that customs cannot be cleared in Durban.

### "willing to go the extra mile"
I was arriving on South African Airways from Washington DC via Ghana and landed at OR Tambo international airport on 3 June 2016. The aircraft landed at 18:45 before I had to make my way through immigration and baggage claim. My connecting flight to Port Elizabeth was departing at 19:45 and I was in danger on missing my flight back home. The flight was about to close, however, a very helpful check-in personnel helped me in my time of need. I would have had to stay overnight in Johannesburg if it wasn't for her. Thank you for having staff who are willing to go the extra mile for customers in need.

### "happy and attentive crew"
Lounge was OK at Johannesburg, no possibility of a Bloody Mary in the morning and a substandard coffee had to suffice. Staff friendly and reasonable food choice. Boarding not prioritised so those needing assistance, parents with kids in strollers, premium and remaining passengers all part of the same throng. On board a very happy and attentive crew who could not have been more helpful. Very pleasant three hour flight from Johannesburg to Mauritius with reasonable quality food and wine. Bags waiting for us at the carousel. In all a really enjoyable flight with South African Airways thanks to the crew.

### "food not a strong point"
Check in via QF in Perth was slow, only three staff for all passengers, one for premium, the other for pre printed boarding passes, the third for economy. Pre printed desk seemed to have an aversion to taking passengers from the premium queue which was about 50% as long as economy at our stage of check in. QF lounge friendly and just adequate re offerings. Boarding efficient and South African Airways flight left on time flying from Perth to Johannesburg. Mature crew who were efficient and warmed up somewhat over the duration of the flight. Food not a strong point at either dinner or breakfast and was pretty much economy standard. Wine mixed in quality but served graciously. IFE very old so did not bother choice was limited. Comfortable duvets and got 7 hours sleep. Arrived on time early in the morning where you have JNB to yourself.

### "in need of an upgrade"
Had a horrible 13 hour flight from Johannesburg to Hong Kong with South African Airways. Aircraft seemed very dated and in need of an upgrade on the interior. Seats did not seem very ergonomic and tray tables did not have any conveniences like a coat/jacket hook. Still had the double headphone port on the seat handle so very difficult to get in and out of seat when people wanted to go to the bathroom. Sound kept going off and kept requesting the attendants help but they could not resolve the issue. Screens on the TVs are ancient and very dark. One of the most frustrating things is undoubtedly the cabin announcements - the sound goes off but your video keeps playing and the announcement comes through your headphones blaring at a higher volume than you were watching at - you have to quickly remove the headphones until the announcements are done. When the seat in front reclines you have almost no room unless you recline as well and have to tilt the screen quite a bit. Bathroom ergonomics were also very poor - cramped and not very practical compared to other flights. The return flight had a wait of almost 45 min to get our bags. Overall the flight was a nightmare despite the food not being too bad. Would avoid the airline going forward unless I know its a newer plane.

### "really good food"
South African Airways from Perth to Johannesburg, an overnight flight on a completely full plane, the meal service was quick and efficient. Really good food on both legs. The seats are a little hard but nice and wide. IFE is one of the worst I have seen. Service good and cabin crew would walk up and down the aisle offering drinks often. Return leg the plane was not full and got two seats which makes a massive difference. Would fly again, however if you are on a day flight take your own source of entertainment as what SAA offers is old and limited.

### "customer service disappointed"
Johannesburg to London with South African Airways, the plane was very old, barely working touch screen and chunky head phones. The staff service polite, but not very passanger focused, just generally present. Selection of films was okay, but I found the food terrible. What disappointed me most was the Customer Service for SAA - I received an offer by email providing me an option to upgrade. Link in the email didn't work and Customer Service were very dismissive. In the end I had no way to take part in the offer I was invited to. Why invite if you cannot follow up?

### "seat is spacious and comfortable"
Rebooked onto South African Airways for first leg due to seat problem on Cathay Pacific, giving the opportunity to compare the two airlines flying from Johannesburg to Kuala Lumpur via Hong Kong. SAA have the older business class seats in 2-2-2 configuration compared with the largest herringbone arrangement all aisle seats of Cathay. Whilst lacking the side table and storage cubbyholes of Cathay, the SAA seat is spacious and comfortable for sitting and sleeping. Service was very good, but tended to be on request, which seems to be becoming the norm on many airlines, and perhaps lacked the polish of Cathay. Dinner served soon after take off was excellent, with a choice of full breakfasts or express service just before landing. Overall a very good flight with little to choose between the two airlines.

### "impressed all round"
Fantastic comfortable flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town with South African Airways. Great service with an on board snack. Had several internal flights on SAA Express all top notch as well. The service was efficient and unobtrusive. Impressed all round. We were in economy seats which better than our Virgin Atlantic Premium Economy seat from London.

### "very rushed"
Flew South African Airways for the first time from London to Joahannesburg and then from Johannesburg to Hong Kong. Disappointed with aircraft (340 on the Hong Kong route) and service on both legs. Seats were lie flat but very outdated with a small pull up video monitor which reminded me of flying in the 90's. The moment we levelled off, tablecloths were placed on the tray and drink and dinner orders taken, both of which were delivered very soon after - too soon. On any other airline you normally get a cocktail or two before dinner service starts. Food was lukewarm and very rushed. A small cheese plate followed immediately after, with no dessert offered on the first flight. Plates cleared, lights out and that's it. Did not see a crew member for the next several hours. Got up twice and went to the galley and no one there either. Breakfast served before landing - again, really mediocre food. Was looking forward to flying this airline and was so disappointed. Have flown business class on several airlines and would place South African at the bottom. Couldn't wait for my Air Canada flight home from Hong Kong, which is saying something.

### "friendly warm service"
Johannesburg to Hong Kong with South African Airways. On the positive side, great staff with friendly warm service and eager to assist. Food nicely presented coupled with great wine. Nice full flat bed. Only negative is the plane is old and the entertainment system needs to be upgraded urgently. I believe SAA is in the process of acquiring new long haul widebody aircraft which should fix the these problems. I will fly with them again.

### "Etihad Airways came second"
My wife and I were on a flight Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg operated by Etihad Airways. My seat would not recline, so I spoke to cabin manager and he upgraded me to business class. The return was a South African Airways  operated Etihad flight from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi, excellently served by SAA staff. In fact, Etihad Airways came second to SAA with regards to friendliness, helpfulness and general service/attitude of SAA staff. Well done. Keep it up.

### "can easily be improved"
Lusaka to Hong Kong via Johannesburg return with South African Airways. Lusaka to Johannesburg, upgraded to Business Class, flight was on time and uneventful. Business Class offering can easily be improved, no drink before departure, no hand towel, first drink only served way after seatbelt sign switched off. No tablecloth when meal served, no snack with drink. All are small things but its the small details that make the difference. Second flight Johannesburg to Hong Kong. Paid the extra R500 per seat for an emergency exit seat, well worth the money - only downside being the crowd around you for the lavatory and during the night the lavatory doors don't auto shut so the light can be bothersome when left open. Flight had to be rerouted via Durban to take on extra fuel due to the heat wave in Johannesburg, added an extra 3 hours to an already long flight and keep in mind, if you have a connecting flight on another airline and you miss it, its your problem to solve - SAA will only assist if the connecting flight was booked on the same ticket. Inflight entertainment system did not work for 75% of the flight, seems to be a constant problem on SAA when I fly with them. Flight crew seem to go to sleep after serving the meal, if you want a drink its self help from the galley. We were told the breakfast would be served two hours before landing, on both flights we were served less than an hour before landing, a mad rush and told no coffee or tea as we are about to land. Return flight to Johannesburg  on time, straightforward flight, this time the entertainment system worked, self help from the galley. On all the SAA long-haul flights I've been on, the seatbelt signs are turned on for several hours, even when there's no turbulence, maybe this is so the flight attendants don't have to do anything? Third flight, back to Lusaka upgraded to business class, same offer as before. I can't seem to understand the point of having a priority boarding line when you all end up in a packed bus to the plane - other airlines but on a small bus for higher class passengers, not SAA.

### "seat would not recline"
Johannesburg to Chennai via Abu Dhabi with South African Airways, and we boarded the flight with much enthuiasm. Once take off was completed and the plane was in the sky I attempted to recline my seat. The seat would not recline and when I informed the air hostess, she offered to move me to another seat, but not my husband. So I flew for 9 hours either in an upright position or leaning against the window and my feet over my husband. At tea service I was asked how I would like my tea, once I had explained, this airhostess was unprofessional and unpleasant. Our return flight was booked through SAA but was an Etihad Airways operated flight, our flight was late arriving at Johannesburg OR Tambo and at one stage we were diverted to Durban for refueling. On arrival we were told by airport officials that our connecting flights had already departed. We were booked into a hotel at Ethyhad's expense and was told their staff would meet us at our hotel with further travel infortion. This never happened and we were told by both Etihad and SAA that the domestic and international tickets amount to 2 separate contracts and neither airline was willing to reimburse us or get us on another flight to our connecting city.

### "staff were very friendly"
South African Airways from London to Johannesburg on an A340. The airline staff were very friendly however the aircraft was showing signs of age. The entertainment system is bad, very slow and some passengers were complaining that it didn't work at all. The food served was terrible and seat comfort was also not nice, although legroom was fine. Would I fly with them again? Probably not - simply because the quality of aircraft and food were pretty bad and premium economy is another way of saying you've got an extra 2 inches of space. The cabin crew were very good - very friendly and very eager to help in any way they could so top marks there. It's just a pity it's let down by the other stuff.

### "revisit recruitment procedures"
I really like the high standards of South African Airways having flown with them so many times. On my flight from Mauritius to Johannesburg in October 2015, the late afternoon flight was punctual with an early departure. The pilot provided a lot of flight information throughout. However, one of the cabin crew was unfriendly. I was on a window seat next to a couple, the attendant served drinks to the couple and moved on as if I didn't exist. I pressed the button and it was ignored. Come on SAA, revisit your recruitment procedures as some of these attendants are not fit to be serving customers!

### "ageing fleet was evident"
South African Airways from Johannesburg to Perth. The SAA Business lounge in Johannesburg is comfortable. Ageing fleet was evident in the A340-600 used on this route. The IFE controls are antiquated and the system froze, requiring a reboot. Meals and service were good, flat beds comfortable. SAA should lower the excessive cabin temperatures they set on long haul night flights - a request to reduce the temperature was acknowledged but not actioned

### "passionate business class crew"
London to Johannesburg with SAA, and a great service from a passionate business class crew. Aircraft clean, contemporary, adequate IFE, and food of good quality and well presented. Arrival lounge in Johannesburg is good for a quick shower on arrival, but should be located beyond baggage transfer desks, not before them. The only criticism is that SAA heats their cabins to almost unbearable levels on long haul night flights.

### "cabin staff friendly"
London Heathrow to Durban via Johannesburg. This was our second trip to Durban with South African Airways. The flight was chosen because it is the shortest duration flight from London. After reading reviews, I thought we would just grin and bear it. On both trips we have been more than happy with our flights. We found the cabin staff friendly, food was good, the films were OK. The wine was particularly nice! Can't really complain at all for the price and the convenience of a shorter flight (Emirates was 25 hours, SAA was 14 hours). I will book SAA again.

### "service is appalling"
I have guest here in Cape Town who flew in yesterday from Paris. One of their bags did not make the trip and they were told it would be on the next flight. In the subsequent 24 hours I have not been able to get one piece of information on the phone. When calling the published number for baggage issues the phone is answered promptly but I am them "put thru to Cape Town" where the phone is literally not answered. I have spent two 30 minute sessions just listening to the phone ring. No recording or direction. This lack of service is appalling.

### "poor communication between staff"
A few days ago I and my family flew from Perth to Johannesburg. Shortly after take off a crew member offered me six seats between four people at the rear of the cabin. Great! Shortly after another crew member asked me to move even further back to create more room. Still okay. Ten minutes later a third tapped me on the shoulder and said: "you must move because we need this seat for someone else. Note: said, not asked. Half an hour later the extra seats we had been given were allocated to a couple unhappy with their seats elsewhere. Thus no extra room, family split up, worse seats than our original allocation, carry ons all over the plane in a variety of overhead lockers. I accept the original move was based on a desire to help but the subsequent three were presumably the result of poor communication between staff.

### "a positive experience"
Johannesburg to Frankfurt on South African Airways was a positive experience. Food was amazing, staff friendly and the seat was comfortable. We took off and landed on time so what more could we ask for? I would fly SAA again. Keep up the great work.

### "lost it's lustre"
As a South African I'm sad to say it but South African Airways has lost it's lustre. My wife and I travelled the Abu Dhabi - Johannesburg return route and all I can say is that is was unpleasant. We had one good thing happen and that was being upgraded to business class for the AUH-JHB leg. Our bags were left in Abu Dhabi (I assume this would be the airports fault). SAA still have not refunded me the costs incurred and it is now 5 months later. Business class seemed to run ok but on the return leg to AUH the economy was just sad. The food was standard and after being served lunch we basically waited abut 5 hours for something else to eat. The FA's in economy seemed disinterested and sometimes unfriendly. The plane seems and feels old. The seats are rather uncomfortable and the IE was very basic. Sorry South African Airways but you've lost me unless you up your game.

### "no attention to any details"
Flew South African Airways from AUH to JNB. After climbing aboard to discover a dirty cabin, coffee stains and grease like butter all over the safety card. Airscape" magazine made of the thinnest material looking tatty with spelling errors and poor typeset. No attention to detail. The IFE was however operational and even though the handset did not work well the volume of entertainment was good. The meal service was not great shakes for a  4 star airline even YC - seemed an afterthought. No menu card which is the usual standard. Maybe best if looking at the magazines. Kudo's to South African Airways as their standard of supplying plenty of alcohol and drinks in small bottles and tins is a saving grace - so nice to have a can of coke to yourself instead of being handed a flat soda from a previously opened 2 litre bottle. The service of the sandwiches (with no choice) from on top of a dirty trolley was not pleasant however. The worst issue by far with the flight however were the delays. ETA 8.15 Landed 9.35 Luggage 10.26. This seems to be a major issue for this arline judging from other comments. No mention before the flight, during the flight, and on landing. I cornered the flight deck on landing but they were completely dismissive and unapologetic. They eventually told me it was because they could not fly over Yemen. Something they must have known on flight planning. J Luggage was delayed for a further 45 min again without apologies or explanation either. The shocked supervisor was so surprised when I voiced my disapproval. So many frustrated passengers and no apologies. Overall not a pleasant experience and a thumbs down.

### "overall a very good experience"
Late night departures 10.30pm outbound, 11.45pm inbound. Efficient boarding and welcome by crew on both flights with champagne or fruit juice served as soon as we settled in. South African Airways have traditional forward facing seats in 2-2-2 configuration which is good for couples but perhaps not ideal for single passengers. Very spacious and comfortable in bed position with mattress cover and duvet. My wife slept virtually entire flight both ways. Food was good with quick service for late night departures. Half empty outbound with very personalized service. Full inbound but still good service. Overall a very good experience.

### "staff seemed disinterested"
A 1.5 hour delay occurred on the last Saturday evening flight to Cape Town. There was no advance notification (sms, or e-mail), and the staff seemed disinterested. After announcements expanding on the SAA achievements, the pilot mentioned the delay in passing without breaking a sweat or acknowleging the inconvenience to parents travelling with small children or the elderly, others awaiting arrival of the flight at 1 am. The in-flight meal looked like pasta but was devoid of taste. A salad of cous-cous boasted a green base with scant carrot sticks for color. This all seemed like business as usual to usual for SAA.

### "another good flight"
Surprised that the duration of the New York to Johannesburg flight is 14 hours, I expected longer flying time. Highlight for me is food and South African Airways are consistent with high quality offering. Great lunch and breakfast. Business class seat is a flat bed. There was some turbulence during the flight and not sure if lying down is the best thing for the body, was a bit sore after the flight. But main point is, got a decent sleep. Found the announcements from the cockpit very restrained - expected announcements to be more friendly and informative. Cabin crew were friendly and courteous. Another good flight.

### "Service was good"
Personally I prefer the A320 over the Boeing 737. Business Class seating is 2 and 3 so only one seat removed from the economy configuration. Service was good, meal disappointing, arrived on time. The South African Airways lounge at Lusaka airport is comfortable, smoking area and nice view of the apron. Drink selection is limited but alright, sandwiches on offer are stale, toilet facilities are clean but the paper towel dispenser is always empty. Newspapers are from the day before.

### "not heard from them since"
In July of 2015, I booked a South African Airways flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg on the South African Airlines website, leaving January 4th 2016. A week later, I received an email notifying me that the flight times had changed and that I need to log on to their website and accept these changes. The change was a little inconvenient, but I did it anyway. Three days later, I got another email notifying me of a change that required me to visit their website. Again, the change was inconvenient, but I accepted. Then another email came. At that point, I tried to contact their customer service department by email to work out what was going on. I didn't want to call their pay number from abroad for obvious reasons, but I kept getting emails notifying me of changes to my flight times without any response from their customer service department. It took multiple complaints to many different branches of the same airline before they finally sent me an email message essentially telling me that if I didn't like their service I could cancel the booking, by which time fares on that route had risen more than 40%. I raised this issue with them and, after many emails backwards and forwards, they promised to look into alternatives and get back to me. That was exactly one month ago and I've not heard from them since. I'm actually quite impressed by how little they care.

### "FA's were attentive and professional"
Smooth check in and orderly boarding. Aircraft interior well appointed and clean. FA's were attentive and professional. Dinner and breakfast were tasty although the portions were rather small. Wines were very good. IFE had a reasonable selection of movies. The seat was narrow but comfortable and the duvet, bed cover and the pillow were great. I had a comfortable sleep for a good portion of the flight. Flight left on time and arrived early. My luggage was waiting for me after I cleared customs and I really liked the idea of a designated luggage area for Priority Passengers. Overall, my first experience with SAA was very good.

### "catering is horrible"
As usual on SAA old planes and seats, staff seldom attentive to clients needs. Worse of all for a country where the food is good and the wines sometimes great, the catering in Business Class is horrible. As for the wines the person selecting them must choose the worst that is available in the country.

### "worst experience of my life"
South African Airways flight from Heathrow to Johannesburg was the worst experience of my life. They changed my seat at the gate, after I had made an effort to book one next to the aisle the day before. The guy serving drinks told us we had get a drink for the dinner as well cause we wouldn't be able to do it later. The duty free lady went to sleep after I asked her to sell me a watch - and she said she would go and get it. Flight attendants rude all the journey. My luggage had remained in London, they promised me they would deliver it to my address in Swaziland - and three days after I landed and at least a dozen calls to SAA and Airlink, I had to go and pick it up from the airport (one hour and a half drive from where I live).

### "severe attitude problem"
Munich to Johannesburg with South African Airways. A broken seat with no alternative, so 10.5 hours of extreme discomfort. The ground staff who cover the spectrum from disinterested to downright rude. No service orientation and a severe attitude problem. Waiting for my return flight at this moment. Delayed indefinitely and not a word from South African Airways about why, when etc.

### "the planes old"
There was no way to make a seat selection online with South African Airways. I couldn't even find out the seats we had until airport check-in, and it was a full flight. Eleven hours in the center and center - no aisle or window seat for either of us. Also, the food was bad, the planes old (two planes, round trip), and the entertainment system was two or three generations old - clunky.

### "inflight entertainment not working"
South African Airways from Lusaka to Johannesburg, paid for an upgrade to business class, service, meal and wine very good, flight on time. From Johannesburg to Heathrow economy class, flight was okay, seat normal economy, meal and service was good but inflight entertainment was not working. Flight was delayed by an hour so missed the connecting flight to Lisbon, was told no problem we are booked on the next flight two hours later. Return journey was a disaster. At TAP (SAA codeshare with TAP) counter in Lisbon airport was told we were booked on the flight to London but that was it. Went to the TAP ticket sales desk, they said it was not their problem and I should contact SAA. After well over an hour on my mobile (can’t wait to see the bill) phoning the SAA call centre in Johannesburg the problem was fixed, apparently someone had forgotten to cancel the ticket on the flight I missed (due to delay) and so it appeared as a “No Show” and therefore automatically cancelled my return leg. The TAP flight from Lisbon was delayed so I missed the first flight to Johannesburg, fortunately they got us on the next flight two hours later but my wife and I were seated in the middle of the plane in different rows. Service and meal on the flight was good but once again the inflight entertainment system was not working. Due to the delay I missed my flight to Lusaka and was booked onto the next flight. A few points for future travel - I will not fly on any route that has Code sharing - we are bombarded with how great all these airline alliances are for us but no one wants to take responsibility for any stuff up, they just leave you to your own devises. Why do airlines advertise how wonderful their inflight entertainment is – you buy into it, pay for it, and get no compensation when it’s not working.

### "it was a decent flight"
Gaborone to Johannesburg was a very small aircraft, which doesn't suprise me. Flight time was an hour and 15 mins. Food service was very good and staff was very friendly. No inflight entertainment except for magazines. Overally, it was a decent South African Airways flight.

### "grateful for their assistance"
Flew South African Airways from Johannesburg to Lagos on 19th September and returned 23 September. Flight left on time arrived a little early both destination. Food was good. My rating is for based on my return flight, I did not feel well during the last few hours of the flight and the crew let me sit on their seats where the temperature was not as hot as in the cabin and the provided me water etc. They let me sit there until we were almost landing and I began to feel much better. They were very concerned and helpful and I am really grateful for their assistance.

### "never to fly with them again"
After using South African Airways it is my intention never to fly with them again. We had two return seats confirmed together, although these were in the middle, they were an aisle seat and the one adjacent. However we were then bumped and put in the two middle ones. The person who was sitting on the aisle was so large she should have been compelled to buy two seats. As an example of her size she had to get an extension on the seat belt and her fat extended over and under the armrest. I felt compelled to move which put me in an awkward position, added to which the dirty looks I got from the poor souls who thought they had an empty seat next to them was very uncomfortable.

### "impression of SAA is negative"
I have flown this route twice in the past year, and overall the impression of SAA is negative, mainly because of cabin crew. Most of them are just there for the ride, and the fact that they have to work makes them grumpy. I saw crew member being rude to passengers, even for simple requests. They did not do drinks runs during the night. If you go to the rear galley for a drink in the night, you may find a crew member sitting on the floor reading a newspaper, and it is a chore for them to provide a drink. IFE moving map did not work and IFE selection was very limited.

### South African Airways customer review
South African Airways would not let me book a seat until I got to the airport. My seat was cramped and uncomfortable in a packed plane, and the inflight entertainment did not work for the whole flight. The flight attendants were unhelpful, and one was nasty when I asked for my pre-ordered vegetarian breakfast (which they had given to someone else). The planes there and back were old with many things which did not function.

### "surprised how helpful the staff were"
I flew with South African Airways yesterday (22 September) from London to Johannesburg Via London. By mistake I missed my flight and I was surprised how helpful the staff of SAA were in London. I was really worried and really didn't know what to do. But the help of the staff of SAA I felt good that I will get on the next flight back to Johannesburg. There was a group of people that worked at the boarding gate, and all of them were really nice and helped me through the situation.

### "crew friendly and attentive"
Return South African Airways flights from London to Johannesburg, both legs on an A330. The seat was spacious with plenty of legroom but it was not lie flat, and reclined to an angled incline although it was enough to get some sleep. Food and drinks were good on both legs, although I was woken up for breakfast on the return well before the advertised 45 minutes before landing. Crew friendly and attentive both legs, although the IFE is now looking somewhat antiquated.

### "then told that the airplane was full"
Our South African Airways flight from Dakar to Washington Dulles was scheduled to depart on August 21st at 2:05. After being in line for over 2 hours with my 4 children, we were then told that the airplane was full / overbooked.

### "after a while I didn't feel comfortable"
The first impression of South African Airways was good, but after a while I didn't feel comfortable. Bathroom wasn't clean and the flush wasn't working well, sink was obstructed. Food was okay, the chicken was spicy, meat had better taste. Vegetarian meal was offered. My seat and my daughter's seat IFE screen didn't function after they rebooted the system. They had to reboot twice and still didn't work. The flight attendant could not do anything about it. They gave me the option to change place but since I was with two young kids there were not enough seats available.

### "the most awful flight ever"
Very disappointed with South African Airways. Had a booked seat and unfortunately was sat on the aisle of two seats. The person next to me pulled my seat rest up got comfortable and settled down taking over half of my seat. I stood most of the night as could not wake her up or to sit down. The cabin grew saw me most of the night standing, not one of them asked if I was alright. I had such back ache and sore knees - the most awful flight ever.

### South African Airways customer review
Recently flew with my 2 sons to Abu Dhabi and back, and was very disappointed with the cabin staff who were not helpful at all. Friendly service is not their strong point. My son's entertainment system was not working for most of the flight. They did not have any kids packs for them because they "forgot to pack it". So instead the attender brought my 3 year old son a bag from business class, which consists of a toothbrush and some socks. I'm not sure how she expected him to keep busy with that.

### South African Airways customer review
Flew SA278 JNB-AUH A330-200. IFE excellent, food quite good. Cabin crew extremely friendly and helpful.Seats very comfortable. I was disappointed that there wasn't a USB port to charge my device but overall a very pleasant experience and will fly with them again.

### South African Airways customer review
I had booked a return to visit folks in Singapore on Etihad. Due to code-share/partnership, SAA takes care of the route between Johannesburg and Abu Dhabi. Overall the flight was average. The service was above average. I felt the stewards performed better than the stewardesses. IFE was not too bad. The only black mark was the delay of 15 minutes with no apparent reason given. I understood from a family who was dis-embarking that they missed their flight the day before mine as the gate closed early by 10 minutes and the flight departed 1 0minutes earlier (debatable as to whether that happened or just their bad timing). Inconsistencies in SAA's timing? Overall, an uneventful flight and average to above-average food and service.

### South African Airways customer review
The only direct flight between South Africa and South America. The seats are comfortable and recline to a flat bed. The business class section was about 50% full. However, when asked for our choice of dinner the attendant said they had only 3 servings for his side of the plane - we were in the 3rd row. The cabin crew were extremely apologetic. The inflight entertainment did not work, despite the cabin crew attempting to reboot the system. In Johannesburg my luggage could not be found,  I received my bag nearly a week later, after contacting lost baggage every day since the flight.

### South African Airways customer review
I thought I would treat myself and paid for an upgrade on this short internal flight. SAA airport lounge was pretty awful - little choice of snacks and no bathrooms (you had to wander down the concourse to a bathroom). On board, I asked for some sparkling wine. They had only dreadful JC le Roux. I then asked for a dry white wine. They had only a sweet Riesling. (They did find a Sauvignon Blanc in economy for me). The hot meal was passable. The seat also passable (my only joy was a small footrest). On arrival they had left my luggage in Johannesburg (I was in transit) and I was asked to wait for the last flight in when they would have my luggage. I did not want to wait 4 hours and they said they would not deliver my case so I went back the next day to pick it up. Overall, simply not worth it.

### South African Airways customer review
Check-in and boarding procedures at Walvis Bay Airport ar a bit of a nightmare. The only room in the hangar which is dedicated to passengers (check-in, ticketing, security, immigration, boarding) is very small, hot and crowded. After this, the flight is smooth on a comfortable, clean plane, with acceptable albeit minimal service. Very punctual.

### South African Airways customer review
The service is exceptional - polite, efficient, and good at communicating between staff. Food is good. I am gluten free and struggle to have a decent meal aboard a flight, I'm lucky if I even get my gluten free meal at all. The meal I received on South African Airways tasted as good as a meal I'd eat at home and everything on my plate was gluten free (and dairy free, except for cheese but I didn't need to eat that). They even provided rice crackers rather than a bread roll. The meal was served just before the other passengers so there was no awkward asking if they had my requested meal. Seats were also comfy and there was plenty of leg room - even for my over 6ft tall uncle who accompanied me. Would recommend flying them and will happily do so again.

### South African Airways customer review
May 20 2015 - After reading the high volume of bad reviews my friends and I were concerned about flying SAA from JFK to Johannesburg. Fortunately we were pleasantly surprised! Staff were courteous and helpful. The seating was comfortable enough for my 5'10 frame. The plane was clean. The only downside was the entertainment on the flight to Johannesburg was not working but the return flight to JFK was perfect. I would fly SAA again without hesitation.

### South African Airways customer review
SA280 17/4/2015. From check-in things started to turn to custard. Check-in clerk was out of her depth. Insisted that a piece of fragile luggage went on the conveyor belts. Placed my wife and I in different rows didn't inform us we only realised once on the flight. SA280 to Perth flight attendants didn't want to know about my problem was very promptly told to go and sit down thankfully a passenger next to me was happy to move. Seats were ok aircraft was tired and overdue for a refit.

### South African Airways customer review
Travelled economy between Cape Town and New York via Johannesburg. The flight to New York is one of the longest in the world - 15.5hrs. But it went by quickly and smoothly. The staff were extremely helpful provided two main meals and regular snacks and water. The seat was comfortable with good leg room. Highly recommended. Immigration in NYC Terminal 4 has improved a lot and was very quick especially if you are a regular visitor. At Jo'burg on return no lines and through to collect baggage quickly. Flight entertainment varied good size screens but some were faulty at times and system had to be re-booted occasionally. Toilet facilities kept very clean.

### South African Airways customer review
SA041 Victoria Falls to JNB. Plane arrived late at Victoria Falls but was turned around very quickly. Very friendly crew and a 3 course lunch with unlimited very good pink sparkling wine. Quite a surprise as on the outward journey last week we got 3 strange canape things made of choux pastry with chicken and one drink. Comfortable seat and smooth disembarkation at Johannesburg.

### South African Airways customer review
Space was very tight. Food trays were too small and seats were very uncomfortable. Flight was very boring due to no entertainment. I'm sure SAA can do much better than this. All in all it was an okay flight. Service was alright.

### South African Airways customer review
24 Mar SA235. 7 Apr SA236. Seating was very tight for an eleven hour flight uncomfortable. Ironically after the eleven hour flight we had a two hour internal flight and the seating and leg room was much better - only a few more inches of leg room but enough to make a substantial difference.

### South African Airways customer review
SA204 NYC to Johannesburg on 3/30/15. Return flight Johannesburg to NYC. Just got back from a trip to South Africa with the tour company using South African Airways. My husband and I were in economy. Trip down to South Africa was OK. Flight attendants kept bathrooms clean. There was not a lot of service. If we wanted water or a snack I had to get up and get if from the galley area. The plane was very hot. There are any vents that you can regulate the amount of AC that you get. You just get the amount of AC I guess that the staff sets. Return trip on South African Air was absolutely terrible. AC was non existent must have been 80-84 degrees in the cabin I asked for more AC and I believe it did get cooler for a short time - maybe 30 mins but then back to extremely hot - absolutely no movement of air. My request for a snack for us was met by" not now maybe in 30 mins" even though the flight announcement said beverages and snacks were available all of the time. Attitude of some not all of the attendants was surly. They serve 2 meals - when not serving meals - they sit in the galleys and read news papers and magazines. No ice the last half of the flight. I don't think I would voluntarily fly the airline anytime in the future. The reason we were on these flights is we were part of a tour that booked our flights on SAA.

### South African Airways customer review
Airbus 330-200 Heathrow to Johannesburg then South African Express DHC-8-400 to Gaborone Botswana return SA Airlink Embraer 135 to Johannesburg and SAA Airbus Johannesburg to London. Outward London to Joburg - plane clean and on time. Seats narrow and hard. Food was good and cabin crew were efficient. SA Express from Jo'burg to Botswana-not as good SAAirlink from Botswana to Joburg - food was served and a drink on a short flight one stewardess but she was so pleasant and hard working. SAA Airbus 330-200 Jo'burg to London - on time again. Cabin crew were good food was presumably loaded in Jo'burg not as good particularly breakfast. Again seat hard and uncomfortable and plane was full. For an airline that is strapped financially SAA did a good job and compares well with other airlines charging more and giving less.

### South African Airways customer review
Last week flew SA060 and return SA061 Johannesburg-Lagos-Johannesburg. Flight to Lagos was delayed by 30 minutes due to 2 passengers not boarding so their luggage had to be removed. However we landed 15 minutes early in Lagos so all good. IFE was very good. Drinks served immediately after take off and Food very quickly after. Flight attendants when called responded quickly. past 7 years I have been mostly on Singapore Airlines ok SAA is not SIA but they still do an excellent job. Seats were also comfortable both ways was Airbus 340-600. Return flight left dead on time and arrive 20 minutes earlier in Johannesburg.

### South African Airways customer review
I flew SAA in January on my way back from Jo'burg to Munich and SAA surpassed all my expectations. The in-flight service was very good and the food was excellent. The seats are what you would expect from economy class but the IFE was also excellent. I will definitely choose SAA again!

### South African Airways customer review
Extremely disappointing business class once more. Seats on a 4 hours flight (JNB to MUR) were coach seats food was basically inedible and wines terrible shocking for a country that produces so many good wines. Entertainment made me remember was offered 15 years ago. The only positive thing was the very good cabin crew: they truly did everything they could.

### South African Airways customer review
I travelled business class between London-Jo'Burg twice this week. The first trip was excellent and had no complaints in fact I would recommend the service. The return trip was a different story. I got horrible service. First the guy directing people sent me to the wrong side of the plane (no issue really) but then the service team was not very polite. However I went to the washroom at one point and three of the service people were chatting I asked them if there was a washroom available on the other side they looked at me then went back to talking. Later I was woken up to get my tray ready but then breakfast never came. I got a coffee but why wake me up for breakfast and not serve any. I was highly annoyed by the service on the return trip.

### South African Airways customer review
Flew Perth - Jo'burg - Nelspruit then Capetown - Jo'burg Perth all business. I had high expectations and I was quite disappointed. The staff were mostly delightful and very nice but I think they were let down by the product. The seats aren't very comfortable and the pillows are tiny and feel very old / used. I had to use 4 from business and 2 from economy class just to make it reasonable to sleep. The amenity kit was bad quality and contents weren't good - an old quilted type bag. I left it on board unopened.

### South African Airways customer review
SA 265 Feb 5. SA 264 on Feb 14. MUC-JNB return on A340-600: I am fully satisfied with my journey to and back from South Africa on SAA. While I attributed the very friendly and generous (in terms of the amount of drinks) service to the first flight being half-empty my very positive experience was confirmed on the second (return) flight when the plane was full to the last seat. The space in economy is more than sufficient and the seats recline properly. The IFA works very well however the choice of movies is rather poor. Due to the delicious wine served with the meal I did not care and slept nearly the entire nights through.

### South African Airways customer review
SA280/281 JNB-PER-JNB. Not a bad flight seat comfortable good pitch and at tentative cabin crew. Food and entertainment a little bland though.

### South African Airways customer review
HKG-CPT via Johannesburg in economy. All flights on time and service was very professional. Was worried about not being able to make connecting flight to CPT while at JNB airport as the line was incredibly long but still managed to make good time. Cabin in JNB to HKG segment got a bit too hot and they obviously use their older aircraft to HKG. Inflight entertainment seemed a bit boring. Nonetheless I would fly them again.

### South African Airways customer review
Flight SA 40 / 41 (JNB-VIC/VIC-JNB) SA 337 (JNB-CPT) SA 420 (PZE-JNB): overall not very satisfied - complicated reservation (system problems long waits at phone etc.) long waiting at check in no preferred treatment as Star Alliance frequent flyer most of the check in staff is unfriendly some even rude. Lounges are all low quality level and also here very unfriendly staff the food at the lounges is below average. On board the staff was mostly OK. Food on all flights was not good. Seat comfort on most flights not very good except SA 337 where they use the long haul aircraft so you have much leg room. Overall an airline which I cannot recommend - unfortunately there is not much alternative within the region.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB to IAD. Second time I have flown long-haul international with SAA and the second time I've had a good flying experience. Seats are older but very comfortable for a large man (6'4" tall). Service in business class was superb. Smiles warmth and left us alone while we slept. The crew changed out in Dakar. The second crew was just as friendly and just as good.

### South African Airways customer review
SA280/281 Perth to Johannesburg return. I recently had to make an unexpected trip back to SA and SAA was the only airline which could help me at the time (due to passport expiring in 3 months). I was not sure what to expect as the reviews are not that good but was pleasantly surprised. The seats are as comfortable as can be expected for economy and had enough leg room. The food on the outbound flight from Perth was not that good but on the return flight was much better. The entertainment system had plenty of good movies and kept me occupied for most of my flights. The crew did tend to disappear after food service but were only a call away and as the flights are night flights this is not a problem as most people were sleeping. I am going back to SA on holiday in December 15 and will use SAA again.

### South African Airways customer review
Seats were uncomfortable. Leg room poor back support uncomfortable making it very difficult to rest or relax. Flight crew good they did their best to make you comfortable and meals tasty. Bathrooms were smelly. Very uncomfortable flight. I wish other airlines would fly to South Africa in order to create competition and make flights more comfortable for passengers. I love South Africa but I would not like to fly SAA again because of the uncomfortable seats.

### South African Airways customer review
PER-JNB return during October 2014. Outbound flight aboard an A340-300 which was showing its age. Return leg used a more modern and comfortable A340-600. SAA offers a reasonable product somewhat reminiscent of Western airlines in the 1980s. Mostly that's a good thing: shorter check-in queues and less evidence of penny-pinching than is now widespread no extra charge for emergency exit seats etc. Meals were tasty and substantial. Cabin crew did not see it as their role to distribute non-alcoholic drinks outside of mealtimes - at least bottled water was available. Staff were also abrupt in directing passengers to fold up their blankets and stow bags on a better airline the staff would do this themselves if it was so important. The cabin temperature on the return leg was too warm and the crew was obsessed with (mostly non-existent) turbulence to such an extent that the warning light remained on for almost the entire flight and hot drinks were cancelled for "safety reasons". I have been on some bumpy flights over the years but this was not one of them. I wish captains would use the fasten seatbelt sign sparingly in times of genuine danger rather than unnecessarily impacting on passenger comfort by acting like the boy who cried wolf.

### South African Airways customer review
I travel 2-3 times a year to Africa and this September had my first round trip on South African. I will never fly with them again! I was 6 months pregnant and was treated better by random strangers in the airports and on the flights than the flight attendants working these flights. On my flight to SA the (extremely helpful gate agents) moved my seat assignment to offer me the most comfort that they could. They placed me in the bulkhead directly behind business class. Yet for the entire 14 hour flight every time I got up to ask the stewardess for water or crackers or anything they rudely told me I needed to be served from the back cabin not the station directly in front of my seat! On my return trip (which was delayed because they were fixing the TVs). The flight attendants were bothered every time I walked myself to the back of the plane to ask for a glass of hot water (like I was too much trouble). They refused to let me carry my own glass to my seat (afraid I would spill it on another passenger) so they would make a big deal of following me back to my seat with my glass. So finally I simply started hitting my call button and asking for hot water and at one point received a lecture from the flight attendant as to when she would be coming back by to collect my hot water as I could not hold it during landing. Her voice was raised so much so that other passengers around me watched the whole thing and then made a joke out of it when she left. Granted 18 hours is a long flight for a pregnant lady but I was trying to be responsible for my own decisions and was asking for very little from these attendants yet continued to be made to feel as if I was a burden.

### South African Airways customer review
As a sometime resident of Cape Town I have flown SAA quite frequently - usually from CT to London but lately to Sao Paulo a route on which (as someone else said) there is no competition. All the cabin crew (at least in economy) are now affirmative-action appointees who appear to have "jobs for life" and it shows in their unsmiling service casual arrogance and general laziness. I don't know if anyone else has mentioned it but on my last 2 flights to and from S.Paulo they didn't serve any pre-dinner drinks and when they dished out the food trays there was no wine or even water in sight. If you ask them they casually fob you off with "we're bringing it around soon" but by the time you get it its at least 20 mins later and your meal is long finished. I don't know any other international airline which doesn't serve wine until the meal is finished. This is not an isolated incident.

### South African Airways customer review
I don't know how many flights I have taken I travel very often and South African Airlines has to be hands down the worst airline I have flown with. I was travelling from Cape Town to London and to start the plane was 6 hours late with no one able to offer any explanation as to why. Once finally seated you notice how old the planes are seat-back entertainment was nowhere to be seen and they still used the old fold down TV in the center of the plane the audio did not work properly and constantly switched between Afrikaans and English. The food was bland and the staff were terrible seats very uncomfortable. I would recommend this airline to no one.

### South African Airways customer review
I flew from Cape Town to Johannesburg and from Johannesburg to Sao Paulo. I fly this route at least 2 times per year with South African Airways. What I always find strange is that when you board the plane the crew is all in the back shouting loudly and laughing. They do not come out to the cabin to welcome you on board - this happens in most airlines. All you hear is them speaking loudly to each other and laughing in the back. Is this the South African welcome? South African Airways prides itself on being the best airline in Africa - but is there really any competition? The service is very poor. I get the feeling that half of the crew really dislikes their job. We had one very rude flight attendant who seemed annoyed when you went to the back of the plane to ask for water or use the toilets. The entertainment of the flight did not work for the first few hours. The food is ok but normally they run out quickly of one of the choices. There were no snacks served between meals. The toilets and the plane were pretty dirty and smelly. Unfortunately SAA is the only option from Brazil to South Africa.

### South African Airways customer review
We flew 4 flights with South African Airways last month. We flew JFK-NY To Johannesburg then to Harare. The flight was horrendous. The 15 hour flight from JFK was especially terrible since the entertainment system never worked. For the entire time there was no visual entertainment nor audio. The worst part is that is was static the entire time! Also we were sitting in the fourth row from the front of economy class. They offered fish or beef. By the time they got to our row they ran out!

### South African Airways customer review
London to Johannesburg return in economy class. Flight punctuality and Food and Drinks service was good. However my experience of using South African Airways was severely dented by having no inflight entertainment system working at all in economy class on the 11 hour flight from Johannesburg to London on the 11th Sept.

### South African Airways customer review
Perth-Johannesburg-Cape Town and return in Business. I was able to use the Qantas lounge at Perth airport. On the outward international A340 flight boarding was smooth; returning the boarding process at Johannesburg was slow due to Australian security requirements. The seats on the A340s were comfortable though the planes are showing their age. The outward Asian vegetarian meal was very bland; the meal loaded at Johannesburg was much better. The service was friendly in both directions. The two domestic flights in B737s were smooth and pleasant. The seats were comfortable and the food was fine. Overall SAA offers a good basic business class (no frills) and good value for money.

### South African Airways customer review
Johannesburg to Cape Town (SA343) on old Boeing 737-800. Online check in and seat selection was not possible. Flight was delayed for 30 minutes (for unknown reasons). Crew was not friendly (really unfriendly). They snarled when you asked something. I fly a lot but I've never experienced such an unfriendly crew before. I mentioned in my reservation that I was vegetarian but during flight only chicken sandwiches were available. Next time I'll fly British Airways instead of SA.

SA8300 Johannesburg (South Africa) to Maun (Botswana) in Business Class. Check in took a very long time and was chaotic. Spacious and comfortable lounge at JNB Airport. Good food selection but I'm very disappointed in the selection of magazines and newspapers. I picked 3 newspapers but all of them were at least one week old. Why no fresh newspapers? For unknown reasons the aircraft had a delay of 40 minutes. Inflight service was worse. I ordered a special meal (vegetarian) and received a confirmation by mail but on board vegetarian meals were not available. I had nothing to eat. That's a shame especially when flying business class. In addition only one drink was served and the rest of the time the crew did not care about the passengers. The worst of all was that (afterwards) the SA-customer service told me that I didn't order a special meal while I had a confirmation of the ordered meal. Inflight entertainment was also worse no newspapers no screen no inflight magazine et c. Seats were quite comfortable but were just like economy seats. However the middle seats were also used in Business Class. Give me one reason why I should fly business class with SA? No meal not more seat space no priority check in etc. This is the second negative experience with SA. I will never fly South African Airways again.

Durban to Harare SA1613 1st July 2014. Ground staff usually good some of the other staff not so. They managed to leave the entire baggage for the whole plane behind - that has to be a first! Seats pretty firm. Some cabin staff great but some a bit messy. Pilot announcements friendly and helpful.

I am an ultra-frequent flier Diamond Skyteam (Delta) Executive Platinum Oneworld (AA) 1K Star Alliance (UA) have travelled SAA on the New York JFK to Johannesburg route (flights 204/203) 10 times this year (5-round trips). Of these flights (9 in coach and 1 in business) only 1 has been remotely satisfactory. On 7 the entertainment system has not worked properly (on 4 not at all). On 7 flights the temperature has been either boiling of freezing and the cause of a multitude of complaints. On 3 flights I did not get the meal I ordered and on the flight I took in business the cabin smelled of the toilets and the seat power went out which meant that the seat could not be moved for 90 minutes. In the coach cabin there is no seat power and the entertainment system is contained in a steel box under the seat which eats up the vast majority of the leg room. On top of all of this complaints whether written in flight or emailed do not get resolved. SAA on the New York to Johannesburg route is to be avoided.

My partner and I visited South Africa in July 2014. We flew into Johannesburg from Cape Town on Saturday 19 July at 4.45pm for our flight to Perth at 10.30pm. We immediately went to check in only to get to the front of the queue and be turned away as they had simply over booked our flight by 50 + people. We were not at all satisfied with the service as we had not only booked these flights a year prior to flying but we were expected back to work on the Monday. We explained this to the one lady in charge and the comment back was "give your boss this letter and he will understand". Not at all something you tell unhappy customers. We were then told there was nothing they could give us for this inexcusable inconvenience. Many of us fought this matter and received free tickets to return (exclusive of taxes). Although we would love to return with a brand new mortgage and job commitments we are not able to use these tickets within a year. There were customers who received nothing and others who received $500 each. Why there wasn't a reimbursement structure in place before turning away customers I don't know? If I were to recommend anything to people looking at flying from Perth to JHB fly via Air Mauritius. The service flight food and service is 100% better!

### South African Airways customer review
I flew from Johannesburg to Hong Kong on August 1st 2014. Service provided by the cabin crew member who was working on my aisle was excellent. He was very friendly and professional. Went to the galley area during the long flight to stretch. The cabin crew member working there at the time was very unfriendly and almost rude. Later when asking another cabin crew member for a drink in the same galley area I was met with a dry expression handed my drink I said 'thank you' with no acknowledgement from this crew member not even a smile. The overall product is quite good delicious food huge selection of drinks often very good service. However there are also extremely rude and unprofessional staff. This is not an isolated experience. Before landing one of the crew members complained to the purser about the cabin crew on the flight. He expressed his views in detail with passengers nearby. This crew member spoke so loudly that it was impossible not to hear him. I found this extremely unprofessional to say the least. It was very unsettling.

I flew to Windhoek on SA078 25 July. I was very pleased to have had the opportunity to fly on the 320. The seats were so spacious with lots of leg room but I was so disappointed with the service. The dinner was served and the drinks trolley arrived once everyone in my part of the cabin had already finished their dessert. SAA has never placed a bottle of water on the trays as many airlines do and their service is not constant. We ate our dinner without anything to drink. What a pity as the airfares are not cheap on this route.

Johannesburg - Mauritius business. Boeing 737 800 2x3 configuration. Very efficient and pleasant crew. Seats were just ok in a quiet old 737 but nothing to complain on for a 3hr 40min trip. Departure and arrival on time with smooth boarding. Meal service was excellent with champagne and canapés high quality starter followed by a tasty main dish followed by cheese and dessert. Above my expectations for as business product for a regional flight. Worthwhile to try!

### South African Airways customer review
Business Class from CPT to VFA via JNB. Easy check in - spacious lounge with helpful staff and pleasant snacks. Business seats on the new A320 narrow and are basically economy seats with the middle seat not used. Much better seats on the A319 and the B737. Food good for the short flights and staff helpful on both flights.

I want to thank SAA more for making my trip to South Africa so comfortable. As a with limited walking ability I was assisted and looked after throughout the whole return trip. The food offered and served was fantastic and to be able to use proper utensils was a pleasure. The trip was easy for me as the requested wheelchair was always there to either meet me or take me to the aircraft. Thank you.

JNB-DUR. Ground staff were friendly they even checked an extra bag for me even though it wasn't part of their codeshare agreement with Delta. Flight was ahead of schedule and landed early. It was pretty cool and they served us good wraps and dessert.

SA 234 JNB to Heathrow. A good flight experience food was enjoyable. Captain's announcement was friendly sincere and fun. Had a good crew.

### South African Airways customer review
I booked up 6 months in advance and by the time of my flight to JNB both the aircraft and my seat allocation had changed to my detriment cabin staff were good food was ok but how I longed for the seat I had originally booked as it had extra leg room and was near to the toilets needed as I'm an oldie. Flight back was the same story SAA really couldn't care less what you booked or where you sit. That is now two 'not so good experiences' flying to and from SA one with SAA and one with Lufthansa.

Flew from IAD to JNB and returned 2 weeks later. My very positive impression of the flight to Jo'burg was tempered by two items. First the rather lacklustre service provided by the crew on the return flight and by the (possibly) worst economy seats in the industry. I'm a little over 6 feet so I'm rarely very comfortable in economy seats but these go past just discomfort. I also have an issue with SAA's seat selection process. I purchased tickets 8 months before the flight. SAA's website allowed me to make seat selections at that time. Apparently that means little or nothing as those seats weren't available when check-in time arrived. I know seat selections aren't guaranteed but really why bother?

Travelled London Heathrow to CPT via JNB and back (4th and 20th April 2014). The good: Our in-flight experience was good to excellent including the service from staff. Dinner on Heathrow to JNB flight was excellent. There was also a lot more legroom than expected for economy class on the new aircraft. The in-flight entertainment system however could be improved when compared with other carriers recently flown. The bad: The online booking system - was subject to several late revisions to our reservations for CPT to JNB / kept splitting our seats up / final booking ended up on Mango airlines. On check in discovered we not even on the CPT to JNB passenger list / Mango airlines apparently not informed of us by SAA. The matter was resolved by Mango. We then discovered the new SAA excess baggage rules at O.R. Tambo airport (JNB to LHR leg)! I felt the check in staff were unprofessional and unapologetic. Be warned - 2 suitcases at 31kg + 29kg for 3 people equals 14kg of excess baggage (our 6 year old's unused baggage allowance was not considered). Also O.R. Tambo direction/ signage confusing and could be improved (although all staff helpful in re-directing us). I will recommend SAA to others for the excellent in flight aspect but suggest avoiding O.R. Tambo if possible / else ensure additional transit time and phone and double check your return flight details a few days before flying.

I flew on 1st March from Durban to Johannesburg (return). The planes were clean and spacious. The food was decent and the staff were very helpful. South African Airways has increased their service exponentially from the last time I flew them. Planes I flew on: an A319-100 and A737-800.

Initial trip: Mauritius - Jo'burg - Buenos Aires. Done itinerary: Mauritius - Jo'burg - Sao Paulo - Buenos - delayed 30 hours. We flew on Thursday pm from Mauritius to Jo'burg (spent overnight in Jo'burg because there was no connection on the same day) and were supposed to fly Jo'burg to Buenos Aires on Friday morning. When we presented for check in 2 hours prior to departure the lady told us the flight was overbooked and unfortunately we won't make it she was not able to give us any other information. After a 30 minute discussion a manager came to us and we must admit he was quite efficient. He gave instruction to another counter girl and she managed to find us 2 seats on the next flight (30 hours later) to Sao Paulo and then a connection flight from GRU to Buenos. So instead of arriving at destination Friday 5pm we arrived Saturday 11pm lost 1 day and 2 nights. Otherwise the aircraft's were all new and decent leg room acceptable proper service and food just correct for an airplane meal!

I was on a business trip from Cape Town to Nairobi via Johannesburg. Although SA flies a small plane on this route (A319) the service was excellent and the food of very high quality. All flights where on time. South African is still one of the best airlines in Africa. The only downside was the price of the ticket as there is no competition on this route (same price as flying to the US).

### South African Airways customer review
My son flew assisted on and SAA flight from Jo'burg to London early December. I choose SAA as after living in SA for 17 years I knew the cabin crew were really good with kids. My son is only 8 and this was his first trip alone to London. From Jo'burg airport all the way through to Heathrow his father and I were absolutely impressed with their level of service and the way they handled my son. He came off the plane very excited about his trip and very relaxed because the staff had put him at ease. They ensure he had his choice of meal covered him up to help him sleep and he tells me the cabin crew made him laugh and talked to him about his trip to the UK. The ground staff who work for SAA were also great. Prompt professional and very caring. I would absolutely fly my son with SAA again.

My husband and I traveled to and from Cape Town South Africa on SAA in January 2014. We had a very pleasant experience. The staff was professional and very accommodating to our every need. The food was delicious. The seating in business class was very comfortable. The choice of movies was adequate and timely. The cabin and bathrooms were clean and neat. I would highly recommend SAA to any one traveling to Africa.

Travelling back from South Africa. Flight CPT to JNB delayed due to bad weather. Told that connecting flight to LHR would be held. But on getting to gate found it had left without us. Stranded in JNB airport at 10pm no SA staff no contact number nowhere to stay. Next 23 hours a complete nightmare. Unhelpful rude and arrogant SA staff at JNB. Will never fly with South African Airways again if you are just hope nothing goes wrong.

JNB-CPT in Dec. on time flight. One female cabin crew was very kind to family and passengers in couples. Always asked "Would you like soft drink coffee/tea and water? Drink with ice? and served with cups. She asked me and a business man next to me "drink? and gave us a coke can without cup and gone without smile.

Flew SA235 from LHR to JNB in business by spending some Star Alliance miles. Check-in at T1 was quick and easy with the boarding pass reflecting my pre-chosen seat. Star Alliance lounge at T1 is still awful (no fault of SAA) heavily overcrowded at peak times and under-lit. Priority boarding a bit chaotic but once on-board staff were quick to provide refreshments and help out with baggage etc. Pushback was delayed 30 min due to the usual evening take-off traffic jam at Heathrow which the staff kindly used to serve another round of drinks. Upon takeoff food and drinks were served quickly and food was surprisingly good. I got the last of the "lighter" meal choices though and was seated up in row 3 - not sure why their algorithm assumes that most passengers would be keen for a heavy beef stew or rich chicken curry right before trying to sleep on an airplane but there you go. I would recommend pre-booking the veg meal or sitting right upfront if you want to have something lighter before sleeping. After dinner I managed to get pretty comfortable in the A340-600 flatbeds and slept for a good 6 hours in total. I believe the A330 has the newer interior and also operated the LHR-JNB route but the seats in the A340 were adequate for sleeping. Only real disappointment is the ICE system as the screens are very outdated compared to some competitor airlines - however this was not an issue for me as my goal was to sleep as much as possible in this flight. Flight arrived 30min early in JNB despite the 30min delay on takeoff and pilot did a good job of avoiding most of the turbulent weather which he warned us about on takeoff so all in all a very nice flight.

SAA 190 and SAA 191 to Mauritius Airbus A330-200. Service was excellent and the cabin crew was professional and friendly. The Airscape in flight entertainment system was top class with the newest movies and TV series available. The seats are extremely comfortable and spacious for economy class compared to other airlines. And the Beef Stroganoff was scrumptious! Very impressed with SAA service and cabin quality.

Malawi to Auckland and return via Cape Town. Unfortunately for SAA the Auckland to Perth sector was with code- share Air New Zealand - which was far superior in all respects. The SAA planes were relatively old and the seats were hard and uncomfortable. The cabin attendants were generally helpful but lacking in spontaneity. The food was bland and the in-flight entertainment was even blander. The air-map did not function at all. On the flight from Jo'burg to Cape Town our seat numbers were changed three times. We had deliberately booked a widow seat months in advance so that we could see the country from above but were changed at the last minute to middle seats. We then found that the rear economy section was almost empty. Cabin staff ignored the lowly cattle-class passengers and were busy reading the paper and chatting amongst themselves. We arrived in Cape Town but our luggage did not. SAA staff were not helpful in reuniting us and our bags. We were told that it would take 3 hours to get our bags to us but no calls were made to us even though we left our phone contacts. Finally after about 15 attempted phone calls we got our bags sent to us but no apology.

SA23 HRE-JNB. Flight arrived late from JNB due to 'technical problems'. No info supplied at HRE. We took off 1 hour after scheduled departure. To its credit SAA supplies a hot lunch even on a short hop like this. However no headphones; drinks came well after the meal (fish and veggies -edible!) and the seat was hard and did not recline. Efficient offload in JNB for a change! That said SAA needs to lift its overall game and not rely on past glories.

As a family of 6 (including 2 senior citizens and 2 children) we have just arrived at OR Tambo on SAA from Hong Kong. The attendants in the Business Class cabin really made us feel as if they are doing us a favour by serving us. This was in complete contrast to the impeccable service experienced by another Star Alliance partner hours earlier. As we have a 3 hour waiting time before our flight departs for Cape Town I am now sitting in the SAA Baobab lounge where the breakfast spread is dismal. There is no cereal and breakfast this morning is limited to muffins 2 different types of Danish and 2 types of pre-packed sandwiches. I eventually decided to go the Diners Club lounge to get some decent breakfast. My kids were still waiting in the Baobab lounge and asked whether they could have some crisps as there was not much to eat I enquired with the gentleman behind the bar. His response was "no it is not 11 o'clock".

We were not impressed with the flight attendants and the plane was in a very poor condition my seat was completely broken.

Flew Cape Town to Jo'Burg and found the flight really good across the board from wonderful professional service to economy seats with above average space. Food was however mediocre and has deteriorated over the last 2-3 years. Overall definitely worth it and much more so than BA on the same route.

Johannesburg to Durban on 16th December scheduled for 6.55am flight SA 531. I was really not impressed with one of the flight attendants serving food. Because I was sitting at the rear and was one of the last to be served he did not bother to serve me or ask the usual chicken or beef or if I wanted the sandwich or not. Fortunately I was not hungry. I was not impressed that such a basic service was missed. Some cabin crew members are still failing in this area.

Was taking the Entebbe-Johannesburg flight today and at the check in counter the staff didn't know how to do a check through to Singapore even when I gave them my electronic ticket number and Booking Ref. Not one but 2 of them (senior ones) said that they cant find it on the system and asked me to go into the lounge to go online and show them the actual e-ticket. On my second attempt I asked a junior staff and he managed to do the check through with the same Booking Ref and Electronic ticket no. This isn't the first time I have encountered such bad service.

Johannesburg-Windhoek Business Class. Boarding on time but very chaotic. Boeing 737-800 looks very old. Not very comfortable seating. Plane is delayed for 40 minutes 'as 12 meals in Economy are missing'. I can't believe it. As a result food was almost inedible because it has been put in the oven at boarding and was completely overcooked. Upon takeoff some (minor) parts of the cabin ceiling fell off. Sad performance sad airline.

Our trip from JNB to JFK a week ago was a disaster. Started okay and managed to watch one movie (flight almost full) then after the meal was served the seat belt sign went on and remained on for the duration of the 16 hours flight. When I tried to get up to stretch I was told to sit down as the seat belt sign was on. When I tried to go to the washroom I was told to return to my seat. Most of the flight attendants (except 2) changed into slumber gear and disappeared until about 3 hours before landing. One of the remaining FA's slept on the back row middle seats and the only time I saw the other one was when he hurried through the cabin once offering water. My entertainment console packed it in and when I asked about it (before they all retired for the night) the staff member said she would call up front to have it reset. Obviously the front staff member in charge of resetting was gone for the night as it did not come on until 3 hours before landing.

Heathrow to Johannesburg return Airbus 340. Outward: Flight full sat on runway for 5 hours while pilot explained that there was a rudder problem. We were fed dinner on the runway by a very grumpy crew while watching our bags being offloaded. Put up in London hotels overnight. Mid day next day we were collected again and taken to Heathrow - put on the plane after 3pm. Sat again for 2 hours as they had not refuelled this plane. Eventually took off nearly 24 hours late. Lost an entire day and this was not a holiday. SAA claim they were exonerated as the crew had worked over hours. Return flight was on time. Organisation during the delay was chaotic - airline staff on the ground did not seem well briefed.

### South African Airways customer review
Flew Jo'burg to Heathrow with SAA. A rather chaotic boarding process in which those at the rear of the plane ended up often boarding last because they didn't embark via seat rows. It therefore took twice as long as it needed to to get everyone seated. The cabin was boiling hot and as is often the case we were seated for a very long time before the plane went anywhere without so much as a glass of water though of course those in business class were busy quaffing champagne as we baked. Dinner and drinks service was good and served by efficient and fairly friendly crew unlike our outbound flight. IFE is really not up to scratch now compared with the competition and my handset kept jamming with TV programmes and games taking an age to load. Seats are rock hard so very uncomfortable for a long night flight but one of the crew helpfully suggested that my partner re-locate to the empty seats in the row in front of us which meant we both (and those next to me) had more room.

### South African Airways customer review
Auckland to Cape Town with the Perth to Cape Town section flown by SAA. I have travelled on countless airlines and this has to be close to the worse experience. No inflight entertainment from Perth to Jo'burg. The meals were terrible (worse than normal for airline food) the crew were rude and unhelpful. I was hungry half way through the flight and wanted a snack but was told there was no snacks and had to wait for the meal service several hours later. Next time I will book Qantas. Thank goodness for Air New Zealand their average service was fantastic in comparison. In summary do not fly SAA look for options if you have to fly with them don't expect too much.

My daughter and I attempted to check in at Johannesburg's OR Tambo airport for our flight to Victoria Falls Zimbabwe. Although we were timely and had paid nearly 8000 rand each for our tickets we were not allowed to check in. We were told that the airline had overbooked the flight. Told that although another group had not yet checked in we were not going to be issued boarding passes unless someone failed to appear. My daughter was able to get on the flight but I had to remain behind and spend the night at the airport Holiday Inn. The airline paid for the hotel and my meals but I asked for a rental car instead of a hotel so I could drive to Vic Falls and only miss half a day of riding. I was refused. The airline gave me a free domestic flight anywhere SAA flies in Africa to be used in the next year. I live in the US and have little or no chance of getting back to Africa in the next year. When I got on the plane I saw at least ten empty seats in business class. I missed a full day and a half of my six day riding tour. My daughter and I were split up during our vacation and left to travel separately. South African Airlines personnel were polite but just passed me around like they were completely helpless.

Entebbe to Johannesburg 15th Sep and back 21st Sep flight SA161 and SA160 respectively. I was jolted out of my sleep by a loud announcement that 'after rebooting several times the TV screens at the back have failed to function and we apologise for the inconvenience'. Come to think of it even on 15th those screens never worked and the whole flight seemed like one of our typical bus rides. That aside the rest of the things were pretty good. I would definitely choose SAA for my next flight down South!

Flew IAD-JNB-CPT and back on the A343 in business class. Good food very good IFE FA's were quite good and paid the right amount of attention to passengers while letting them sleep during this 20 hour journey. Far superior than my experience with US carriers such as UAL. Flat bed seats are good and I arrived with little or no jetlag even though I was six time zones away from home.

### South African Airways customer review
After spending almost 800 dollars months ago for a round trip ticket from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls my daughter and I were denied a boarding pass because the airline overbooked its only flight of the day. While trying to resolve this we learned that there was a group that had also not yet checked in but the airline made the decision that my daughter and I though we arrived first and in a timely manner would have to wait standby until this larger group arrived and they were given boarding passes. Because one person did not show up we were given one boarding pass. I sent my daughter ahead without me and I am sitting in a Holiday Inn near the OR Tambo Airport waiting to fly out tomorrow. To make up for missing two days of my tour the airline has given me a voucher for a domestic flight on their airline to use in the next year. As I am halfway around the world from home this voucher is useless. Although polite staff just shuttled me from person to person place to place. So instead my daughter is alone in Zimbabwe and I am alone in Johannesburg South Africa. This is utterly wrong.

I flew SAA from Mumbai to Cotonou (Benin) via Johannesburg. I arrived early enough in Mumbai to get an exit row seat. That was brilliant - great legroom and very comfortable. The other seats also seemed nice. Plane was an Airbus 330-200. IFE was great - but I slept for most of the flight. I usually get an Asian veg special meal - but it was one of the default options. Flight landed a bit early at Jo'burg. Spent an hour or so shopping. On the flight to Cotonou I was upgraded to business class because of my Star Alliance status I guess. This was a day flight on an Airbus A 319 so the business class was not lie flat but rather a wider and nicer seat and with much better meals. Flight was punctual though it included 1 stopover at Pointe Noire Congo. Cotonou airport was a mess but that has nothing to do with SAA. Bottom line I will fly SAA again even if it means a few hours extra. My alternative was Ethiopian or Kenyan but these don't have daily service to Benin and included 1 leg in an unknown African airline which have to avoided like the plague for their terrible safety records. SAA was pricier but I got comfortable seating wonderful warm service and good food.

### South African Airways customer review
They are a real hodge podge of excellent and completely inept service. Pros: The inflight entertainment okay legroom inflight attendants and meals were above average. Cons: On the return flight from JNB-JFK I checked in 2.5 hours before the flight and was told I couldn't fly. My confirmed reserved seats were still available but they'd loaded too much cargo. After 2 hours of staff bickering with each other they finally allowed us on the plane but had given my family's seats away to someone else. When they finally issued our seats we were scattered and all 4 of us were in the worst possible non-connected middle seats. No apology for the inconvenience. The inbound flight from IAD-JNB did not have these issues and remitted a higher rating. But it felt like customer service roulette. They did however misplace one of our luggage items and took 4 days to get it to us.

### South African Airways customer review
We just got back from a trip to South Africa (DC to Cape Town and elsewhere). My three most favorite words in the English language are now lay-flat seats. The flight attendants were very good and attentive. For more than 40 hours in the air (round trip) I never once had to hit the call button or hunt down a flight attendant to seek service. My glass always seemed to be filled. Now I must admit their food is not all that great but still it is much better than best cuisine you'll ever get in coach. Besides on a trip as lengthy as what we faced having space and comfort trumped food. In the comfort and space department SAA certainly delivered. We landed feeling very fresh and ready to go. Besides once we landed in county we had more than our fare share of food. So not overeating in transit was even a bigger plus. If I ever go back I'd fly SAA again.

My experience was on the Douala to Libreville (continuing to Johannesburg) flight in the evening. I bought a business class ticket but got a low-cost coach airline service. At check-in whatever weight you will pay extra for a 2nd piece of checked-in luggage. On board business seats are coach seats and worst is the service: dinner is an extremely bad sandwich (dry bread with no more than 1 ounce of chicken) and a choice of sodas no wine no beer.

### South African Airways customer review
My flight to South Africa with my 6 month old was fine in fact quite enjoyable. Unfortunately our return flight could not have been any worse due to the over booking and re-seating process. We were we tossed from pillar to post as the seat we had been allocated was taken to re-seat a mother and daughter. I was then offered another seat which was next to another re-seated passenger obviously put out as he had been downgraded due to the plane being overbooked. I was then re-seated for a final time in between 2 people. It was certainly not ideal with a 7 month old as I could not get up easily if I needed to settle my son. I felt the service in this case fell well below the standard I expected and below that which I experienced on the outbound flight.

Service on the other hand was below average as one of the air hostesses was unfriendly to one of my friends. Inbound flight from WDH-JNB was a very pleasant experience. Flight SA075: A Star Alliance Boeing 737-800 jet was a little outdated on the seats but the service was very good before I knew it a hot lunch was being served and tasted great for airline food good portion size and plenty of water after a long tour of Namibia. Very smooth landing on both flights. Looking forward to flying with South African Airways in the near future.

Flight from JNB to LHR was an overnight flight in business class. Service was very attentive wine nice and food good for airline fare. Service was better than Lufthansa on par with Turkish Air and much better than United or US carriers. Only problems was the seat and video. In could not get the lumbar comfortable for sitting (minor problem) but sleeping was difficult. Felt that there were rods in the sear when I put it in the lie flat position. The video system seemed to run all the movies in sync and did not give a menu of choices.

Staff on both flights helpful and courteous. Food - business and economy excellent - full cooked meals - for a short two hour flight.

Flew from Hong Kong To Johannesburg. The cabin crew entered the terminal passenger area prior to boarding to check boarding passes and passports. They were rude in their manner. On the plane they were rude and noisy. On my return from Johannesburg to Hong Kong I found the staff at Johannesburg airport to be slow and unhelpful. There was a long queue at the security counter and only two checking lines were operational this was in spite of the fact that people were arriving for a number of international flights. My flight was also delayed and eventually left nearly an hour late. I find the service for SAA formally one of the world's best airlines to be one of the poorest and although Johannesburg International Airport has improved since the World Cup Football it still has a long way to go to become the international hub it once was.

On a recent round trip JFK to Johannesburg in Business class we found SAA to be excellent in every way. Business class seats are very good.

I am currently in Entebbe (Uganda) and awaiting to board the delayed flight SA161 to JNB. It was scheduled to take off at 07.25 in Uganda but we have been informed that it will only take off by 10am today (25 May 2013). My concern is that I have a connection flight to PE scheduled to take off from JNB by 13.10pm (SA417). My incoming flight will then literally arrive minutes before SA417 will depart for PE. I am therefore looking forward in anticipation to see how SAA will deal with and co-ordinate linking myself up with the flight to PE later today. If SAA can pull this one off without a passenger having to be inconvenienced it will be great. Time will tell as it is currently impossible to inquire about this at the Entebbe Airport and having cleared customs already.

CPT-JNB return. Both flights on B737-800. Cabin crew very friendly. I sat at the emergency exit and cabin crew member explained what I should do in case of an emergency in a professional and friendly manner. IFE could use some work but I suppose its acceptable for a 1hr 45min flight. Food was great. Liked the announcements from the pilots they were regular and very informative. Both landings were greasers (smooth landings). SAA pilots are definitely amongst the best in the world. Overall a great experience and great value for money.

Flew PER-JNB return on A340 and was appalled by this service. In flight entertainment was almost non existent. Channels were interfering with one another so nothing made sense. Food was poor and on the way to JNB it was cold. Will avoid flying SAA in the future regardless of the cost.

JFK-JNB return. This was my first long haul flight and first trip to Africa. (Many transatlantic flights though) I found everything about the trip to be professional and meeting my expectations. The seats reclined sufficiently for the level of service. Food and food options were good. Lots of snacks good portion sizes etc. The wine was decent and did the trick. The in-flight entertainment really helped pass the time. I watched more TV and movies on those two flights than I've watched in months. I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the flight attendants. The return flight was only about 40% full so I was able to fully lay down and sleep 10+ hours straight. An overall great experience I'd fly with them again.

Domestic flight CPT-JNB was fine - good staff decent plane no hassles. Be aware though that passengers bring enormous amounts of hand luggage - big bags or multiple bags (I even saw two guys who each had a medium-sized box in addition to their carry-on bags.

When attempting to travel to Cape Town from New York City for Cape Town Jazz Festival flight got cancelled due to engine failure. Took 3.5 hrs to get rebooked onto an Emirates Flight departing 12 hrs later which would have 8 hr layover in Dubai. Got day rooms at JFK after some discussion. When returning to airport to check into Emirates flight we were told SAA had never made the reservation in the system there would be no meals and there was no connection out of Dubai. We went home. As compensation they "offered" us 25% off a new ticket.

May 3 SA 083 COO-JNB Economy. SAA offer the only direct flights between COO and JNB twice a week. Tried checking in online but the response from the system was always "error - We could not find that reservation". Even called the SAA office to get it corrected but did not get any relief. Fortunately there was no problem checking in at the airport. Delayed on take-off for about one hour. Not a single word of explanation or apology came from the crew. Aircraft was Airbus 319 and the flight was full. The food was meagre and awful - almost inedible. Again delayed taking off after the stopover in Pointe Noire it was already dark when we arrived in Johannesburg making me miss my meeting of the evening. Only on arrival at OR Tambo airport that someone apologized for the delay. When the aircraft had parked at the terminal they could not get the gangway to open and we had to wait some more. Mechanics were called but still they could not open it. The buses came to the rescue to take us to the terminal. We had to descend down the stairs with all our hand luggage. With all the above missteps it was a disappointing experience. I did not find any reason for assigning four stars to this airline.

Good duvet and real feather pillow so able to get some sleep. Meals: excellent quality for airline food and adequate portions and complementing wines. Movies: Did JFK-JNB-JFK in the same month so I was hard pressed by the end of March but it is a good on demand system. Value for money: SAA has monopoly on the routes to South America from SA so they can and do charge what they like. Worst Part: SAA continues to use low grade cheap instant coffee in Business class which is not acceptable when so much attention has been paid to other aspects of the product. Additionally JNB-EZE is day time flying during comparatively 'normal' hours either side of the south Atlantic yet SAA insists on blacking out the cabin with all window shades down. 11 hours is too long to sit in artificial blackout especially since I have never been in SA226/7 when Business class is more than half empty. Rows 15/16 in their own 'cabin' are very nice to sit in if the crew are not using it as a bedroom.

HKG-JNB-WVB and back two weeks later LVI-JNB-HKG. Long Haul flights from and to HKG were on time. SAA connect operates to WVB and we got delayed by 1 hour due to technical defect. Have never experienced that the pilot would come to departure hall and explain about the delay and later gave a very detailed explanation before take off. Well done. Food was alright nothing special really same with IFE. Very quiet flight. Contacted Call Centre for seat reservation which was carried out promptly.

Booked on Flight 359 from Jo'burg to Cape Town on 12 April 2013. One of our bags was the last off Flight 7701 from Sydney even though it was tagged "Business". Staff at the desks were more interested in chatting to each other than booking us through to the Cape Town flight. Finally joined other people at the boarding gate only to be told a couple of minutes later that the gate was being closed leaving 28 of us stranded there! Had to head downstairs again to find another flight which ended up being 3 hours later even though our luggage left on the original flight.

Onboard an international flight (Cape Town to New Zealand). Just before Johannesburg we were diverted to Bloemfontein "due to bad weather". We had to wait 3+ hours for the plane to be refuelled - in which we did not get much updates or any food or water! Then majority of people on the plane missed their connecting flights. When we were finally on our way back to Johannesburg we were told that the ground staff will meet us and tell us exactly where to go. But there were no ground staff meeting us instead we had to run up and down (with a baby) to find out where to go. Hours later someone finally helped us and we were put up in a hotel for the night. We were told to go back to the airport the next morning to re-book our connecting flights which we did. The worst service I have experienced especially travelling with a baby. Not recommended to anyone travelling with kids.

Flew Windhoek to Johannesburg. Flight was full and airline upgraded many people from Economy into business - to the effect that the entire C class was completely full. It felt crowded like in Y class. Not very pleasant for people that paid for the fare. Flight attendants very friendly and efficient and food was good though.

### South African Airways customer review
We flew to Johannesburg from JFK. Plenty of room in economy as compared with US airlines The food and service were excellent. Less leg room on the Jo'burg-Cape Town short flight but full service meal and good FA service. Return to Jo'burg about the same. The flight back to JFK was wonderful again. Goof IFE great food and service.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-PER in economy. Reasonable flight not comfortable but no worse than most economy flights. Staff pleasant enough. Food very poor and breakfast unpleasant. Eat before you get on board. Nothing to particularly recommend it except this is the only flight on this route.

### South African Airways customer review
Flew NBO - JNB - CPT - JNB - NBO in Business class. Excellent service on all fights with crew going out of their way to help. Food was always excellent as were drinks. The crew were chatty and suggested wine pairings with food. Check in luggage handling boarding etc. were all very good experiences. We had the 737's on 3 legs and A340-600 on JNB - CPT. The A340 is a very comfortable aircraft. Only downside is remote boarding and a huge jam at CPT waiting for luggage.

### South African Airways customer review
CPT to JFK via JNB (6 March) and LHR to CPT via JNB (20 March). On time for all flights. Comfortable seats - good entertainment system. Flight to JFK lightly loaded so able to spread out - helpful given that it is a 16 hr flight. Others completely full. Check in staff very helpful. Staff on all fights excellent - pleasant food and regular visits to the cabin with drinks during night flights. Prices on the high side but well recommended.

### South African Airways customer review
Business Class IAD-DKR-JNB. Very comfortable flights with the flat bed on A340-600. Flights arrived in DKR and JNB 45 minutes early! Crews were friendly and accommodating and the food service was excellent on each leg. SA have definitely made some improvements in the service area (although I know this can be hit or miss). Each main course had 4 options and there was more than enough food throughout the flight. Got plenty of bottled water and tea/coffee always piping hot!

### South African Airways customer review
Flight PER - JNB return economy. Seats narrow poor leg room. Cabin crew on outward flight rude and extremely unhelpful return flight very good service. Meals were cold and plane was late leaving due to non arrival of meals ground staff were not available as it was the weekend we were informed.

Flew from Cape Town to Johannesburg. Check in at Cape Town unable to check luggage through to Sydney. Plane left 50 minutes late and had to wait 35 minutes for luggage in Johannesburg causing me to miss flight to Sydney. Ground staff and SAA help desk at Jo'burg all offered a "I do not care attitude". No help received or even offered. Last time I fly South African Airways.

### South African Airways customer review
We left on the 1st Feb LHR - JNB - CPT. The checkin was fine but the flight was the worst I have ever experienced! The crew: not one glimmer of a smile no please no thank you it was as if they resented serving us and we did not feel at all looked after. The Food: one mouthful was more than enough - disgusting! The entertainment system: the map never worked and my touch screen was broken - just shrugs from the crew my partners headphones only worked in one ear. The worst thing was the temperature my partner works outdoors and will often refer to 7c as 'balmy' but on this flight we froze as did everyone else - what is that about SAA? The flight from JNB - CPT was a little better - the staff were at least a little friendly. The return flights were a little better but but the food was again totally disgusting and I am used to airline food. The entertainment system did work but had a very poor and very old selection of films. The cabin temperature was again unacceptably cold. We will never fly SAA again and will warn all our friends and family of our experience.

### South African Airways customer review
Flew 18 February Johannesburg to London. Flight timing OK. This must have been the oldest A340 in the fleet. Plane virtually full and very uncomfortable hardly any knee room. No seat back entertainment screens something not seen on an international flight for years. Entertainment consisted of one film displayed on a few drop down TVs reminiscent of cheap European charter flights. Food was passable no better and served reasonably efficiently by a crew who showed little rapport with customers. Our journey from Cape Town had originally been booked for a direct flight but SAA change to route all flights via Johannesburg meant an additional 5 to 6 hours on our journey.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB. From Check-in to baggage collection SAA service was flawless. Air stewards friendly food was as good as airline food can get (mediocre) but not worse than any of SAA's competitors. Aircraft was clean and staff was generally friendlier than other airline staff. I will fly with them again.

### South African Airways customer review
7 day London - Johannesburg return. What has happened? From someone with over 40 years experience of flying 'The Springbok' these 2 flights were just terrible. Outbound: Aircraft A340 was clean and tidy left a little late and arrived a little early. Crew - no smiles no interest no service! Food was ok and apart from the 'map' not working IFE was good. 4/10. Return: Check-in staff had no uniform making it difficult to tell who was who. Aircraft was for some reason an A320 but was clean and as far as I could see in very good condition. Flight was far from full capacity. Crew were ok with prompt service but virtually no passenger interaction between meals which on this particular flight were far from being tasty. IFE was good and again apart from the first few hours there was no 'map'! 4/10. They really need to improve their product if you want to compete in today's' marketplace.

### South African Airways customer review
JFK to JHB return on 12/29/12 and 1/13/13 and was very satisfied with the business class service. The flight attendants on both flights were very friendly and pleasant and attentive during drink and meal service. It is true that the attendants then disappear for the majority of the flight but since most of the passengers are sleeping I think passengers would be very annoyed to have service carts going up and down the aisles during this time. If one wants something one can ask and it will be supplied. The seats were very comfortable as beds and I slept well. I have no complaints at all.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB return. What I experienced especially JNB-LHR leg was excellent. Flight attendants were attentive and courteous with even the most basic request. The food itself was excellent. The pilots made regular announcements notifying passengers before meals of the choices as well as apologizing beforehand if we don't get what we want because of the meals being made in a 'ratio basis'. When I last flew SAA the only source of entertainment were small screens every few rows but now was offered a good selection of AVOD. The seating was comfortable and was equivalent to the Economy Plus offered by United (which you have to pay extra for) for leg space which I experienced with my connecting flight from LHR to ORD. Overall a very pleasant trip. Would gladly fly again.

### South African Airways customer review
IAD-DKR-IAD. Both outbound and return flight were on time. Lie-flat seat is a little hard in seating position but very comfortable if you use the blanket as a mattress in the bed position. Dakar-IAD leaving at 2am the entire flight is by night. IAD-DKR is overnight as well. Food is ok but nothing special. Breakfast was not served before arrival in Dakar which is odd particularly in C class. The video system is not very easy to use but the screen is adequate and the earphones are good. In all SAA's business product is very correct. I would recommend the airline at least for this class of service.

### South African Airways customer review
Port Elizabeth-Johannesburg on a quite old 737-800 flying with a packed Economy. The service was pretty good: nice cabin crew a tasty and complete breakfast was served as this was an early morning flight. Good selection of beverages. Comfort of the seat quite good. Landed ahead of schedule in JNB. Johannesburg to Cape Town: this second flight was a different story. Flew on a pretty new and well-maintained but empty Airbus A340-600 which was surprising to me as flight time is only two hours on this route. Cabin crew were not good: quite rude kept chatting among them for the whole trip in the back of the aircraft ignoring some requests from a group of Dutch passengers. A poor sandwich was served as lunch with the usual selection of beverages. The entertainment system was not running but I could notice it is not the new touch-screen version. Space for legs good with the usual 2-4-2 configuration for the A340. Overall the price paid was too high for what you get back aboard.

### South African Airways customer review
SA 288 3 January Johannesburg - Beijing Business (Premium) class Seat 7K. Uninspiring mediocre and ordinary in every respect. Flight empty in business class cabin 8 passengers with 42 seats on A340-600. Departure at 00.30 drinks service canapés main meal service. Crew just going through the motions with a complete lack of enthusiasm. Lots of loud chatting and laughing in the galley. Such an ordinary product. In flight amenity kit best left behind - apparently a new product line - just the very basics. Requested coffee twice and staff happily complied served in a paper cup with a serviette. Duvet and over seat mattress placed on empty seat next to me - no offer to make the bed? One blessing on such a long flight is that the IFE is good with a large selection of movies and series.

### South African Airways customer review
Flew from London to Johannesburg in economy. Love the new seats and the staff were great. The French airspace was closed and the pilot kept us informed and offered to fly the next morning with free accommodations despite the fact many others were just sitting on the tarmac we did have a vote and choose to stay and then went over Poland. Fantastic airline.

LHR-JNB. Was switched from LHR-ZCH-JNB when Zurich airport was closed by heavy snow. Despite the late switch SAA managed to get my wife and I on adjacent seats. SAA always scores well on flight attendant service and the excellent bed cover and duvet. Used the Arrivals Lounge and as usual this was quiet and well-staffed.

### South African Airways customer review
Flew Johannesburg to Washington route on 1st December 2012. I was on economy class and there were no amenities whatsoever. The least SAA could have done was to send out a notice that they do not hand out any amenities because why would I pay so much and not get an amenities bag.

### South African Airways customer review
We were on A340-300 from Dulles to Johannesburg. The seats were impossibly small. I am 5'6" and could not cross or move my legs. My husband is 6' and could not move at all. The layover in Dakar only made it worse. The flight was long enough without adding a stop. A340-600 could have made it non-stop. If you are ever on the 300 change your route. We travelled extensively by air in Africa on BOAC planes that were twice as roomy as the SAA. The worse part of the trip to Johannesburg was knowing we had to do it again to get home.

### South African Airways customer review
Very good trip CPT-LHR. Staff very friendly and professional. Food about the best of any airlines. Aircraft clean. Entertainment up to date. Seats comfortable.

### South African Airways customer review
Business class on A340-600 CPT to JNB on Oct 1. Business class lounge nice with light snacks/espresso machines/staffed bar. The latter turned out to be better than the food on board. Never flown economy on SAA so unsure of the difference. Business class product comparable if not worse than US carriers. Lie flat seats are those that do not fully recline but didn't attempt sleeping on this 2 hour flight. Plenty of leg room but no pillows/blankets. Asked FA for a blanket but she never got back to me. IFE non-existent and meal which consisted of a pre-packaged salad and small dessert was of poor quality. Two drink runs which was good but after the meal/drinks FA's retreated to the galley where they talked amongst themselves. The fare cost $240 USD more than economy not counting the extra bag fee. Business class on this flight not worth the extra money and would have chosen economy if I had it to do over again.

### South African Airways customer review
CPT-JNB-CPT on 737-800 in Economy. Both flights left early and arrived on-time. Both flights fully booked. Food was great! Received the standard chicken croissant and muffin on the 10h00 flight to JNB. On the return flight to CPT at 17h00 we had a choice between a hot option of lamb and rice or chicken pasta along with a salad dessert  bun and chocolate. Also could choose between more than 2 red wines. Cabin professional on both flights was impressed by how much service improved over the last 3 years.

Cape Town to Johannesburg in economy on 11 October. Flight delayed due to closure of Jo'burg airport because of bad weather. Captain kept us informed. Some of the time made up during flight. Easy boarding and deplaning. helpful staff pleasant food and ok seats.

### South African Airways customer review
Flew recently Hong Kong-JNB and back. Terrible service and refusal on both trips of a baby bassinet even though it was booked 2 months in advance. Our baby met all the safety regulations but still told they are "breaking the law" when they will give us one. On the first flight we managed to convince the captain to give us one baby slept 8 hours out of 13.5 hour flight. Also we only received one bottle of water the entire flight and were told to go get our own beverages. Temperature in-flight was way too cold. When ringing for service we were ignored. Return flight better service but refusal of booked bassinet and our baby was the only one on the entire flight (under 9 kg and 73cm) I was moved to a two window seater and could not sleep throughout the flight. Towards the end of flight the captain told me not to fly alone again with my baby or bring a car seat next time.

### South African Airways customer review
Sao Paulo to Johannesburg on 2 October 2012. The cabin crew were one of the worst I have experienced. Their behaviour and conversation before we boarded was less than professional. The flight was smooth so it made me wonder why the food trolley was bumping into the passengers. There was one passenger who had requested a vegan meal when she booked and when she asked the air hostess she was told "no we don't have any vegetarian meals". She didn't even try to compromise which was something that could have been done.

### South African Airways customer review
SA 191 Mauritius - Johannesburg 28th September. Seat 6A. This really is a very mediocre domestic business class product for a medium haul flight of 4 hours 35 minutes. On boarding two elderly male flight attendants who when asked how they were the one's response was 'you do not want to know'. No pre-take off refreshments no hot towel service. Newspapers half heatedly passed out. Meals slammed onto tables - the beef selection ran out somewhere near row 3. Drinks - unopened can of mixer and alcohol miniature handed to me with a glass containing ice. Absolutely no interest in providing anything but the bare minimum service. And then the parade of economy class travellers starts traipsing through to use the toilets.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-WDH-JNB in Business Class. Food excellent service very good. Only complaint is that they allow economy passengers to use the business class toilet. On other airlines this is forbidden.

Flew Business Class to and from Perth to Johannesburg on an A340-300. Very comfortable relatively flatbed seats excellent crews and service and good choice of quality meals. Only gripe on the A340-300 is that the cabin temperature on these night flights was set way too high and was exceptionally uncomfortable with crew resistant to lowering it and with one staff member claiming it was a defect of the A340's! The Business Class service on the 738's between Johannesburg and Cape Town was good but the aircraft are showing their age and if anyone looks at floor level you'll notice grubbiness and that the IFE units are coming apart - not a good look.

### South African Airways customer review
I have flown SAA 203 and 204 six times this year from JFK to JNB. I have done it both Business and Economy. If you must fly the route pay for economy. You will be very disappointed in the premium class price for what you get. Seat is an average business seat (almost 180 but not flat as they say) and lots of room between seats. Nothing good after that. Food is average instant coffee service is slow - they leave empty bottles and trash around seats while they are eating and talking in galley. By the way this isn't one flight with one crew. This is a constant thing. Even though you pay $9000US and up for a seat and it states "confirmed" their policy states there are "no" confirmed seats even when traveling with others. Again not that big of a deal but when you can fly a UAE flight for less money I am going that route going forward. It's really almost comical when you think about the lack of service care regard or willingness to serve. There are exceptions so this isn't a 100% of their employees however I feel the majority of interactions will fall into this review.

### South African Airways customer review
High chance you will be bumped off the flight you have booked and paid for. As tourists arriving via BA from LHR to Jo'burg for an SAA internal flight to Durban - after an hour and 15mins! Getting through immigration and still arriving at check-in desk 1hr before flight we were bumped. Desk lady was unhelpful and ignorant. Offered place on next flight (hour later). No refund offered. Possible to get a voucher for another flight valid for 12 months - not much use to tourists not planning on using their services again or be in SA in the near future. Eventually got ourselves upgraded to Business on the next flight and access to the lounge - not a great bonus during a 50 minute hop. Check-in as soon as possible and avoid JB airport their immigration set up is positively Dickensian. Your payment and booking does not guarantee you'll be on the flight.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-CPT-JNB C class. Nice experience on the ground (dedicated check-in counters but no priority lane for security) and in the air with flights on time and adequate service on board (meals and drinks). Anyhow lounge experience at both JNB and CPT was a bit disappointing due to poor food selection (salad wraps fruits and crackers) compensated by free wifi. The seat quality on this route depends heavily on the aircraft used. On outbound flight we had a B737 dedicated to domestic routes with limited comfort while the inbound flight was on an A340 also used for intercontinental routes meaning the seat could be transformed into a fully flat bed. As there are many flights a day on this segment I would advise travelers to pick the journeys involving long haul aircraft's.

### South African Airways customer review
EZE-JNB-CPT-JNB-EZE Airbus A340-300. Seats comfortable not BA Club World equiv flat or private but quite adequate to sleep and the cabins on all flights (these and the 3 round trips in Business over the preceding months incl NYC/CPT) are of high standard. Duvet and pillow are real! Food (on long haul) excellent (didn't look at it on the SA local sections) though SAA offers the worst instant coffee. I am usually disinterested in the food on most airlines but this was notably good. I'd forgo some of the service item enhancements to have a decent cup of coffee. Staff: All exceedingly efficient. Some - I suggest those who have been there many years very efficient to their duty but not vaguely hospitable. The others all excelled in all areas. Movies: on demand large choice headsets are not noise cancelling but a good system all the same. Worst Part: Johannesburg Airport luggage delivery is consistently bad to downright pathetic and not an SAA person in sight at JNB airport to ask. Everyone blaming everyone else. Johannesburg airport remains from my living memory one of the worst signed places on the airport - network - always has been.

Flew SA 78 From Windhoek to Johannesburg and then on ward to Lilongwe on SA 170 both flights operated by a Boeing 737-800. Food was good seats comfortable and ground crew in Windhoek were great as I arrived late for check in and they were closing the flight but they still checked me and transfer at Johannesburg was smooth as I already had my JNB-LLW boarding pass issued to me in Windhoek. Would not hesitate to fly them again.

Frankfurt to Durban and Durban to Munich (via Johannesburg). Economy class. The economy class seats are very tight and when the traveller in front puts downs their seat there is little or no place for anything on the tray table. The food is indifferent and tasteless.

JFK - Johanesburg June 20th. I was told there will be lunch dinner and breakfast but got only lunch at 12 noon and nothing else but breakfast after 12 hours. I asked what happened to dinner the hostess mentioned they are cutting costs. I was surprised on a 15 hr flight and not enough food. Hostess service was also the worst I had seen. Entertainment did not work even after resetting the system 3 times.

Mumbai - Johannesburg return in Economy class. Plane was A330. Flights on time. Decent Indian vegetarian meals. Excellent in flight entertainment.

### South African Airways customer review
I flew Cape Town - JNB - Livingstone and back. The first two legs were fine flights on time and service good. However check-in in Zambia Livingstone was a nightmare. I had one regulation size carry on bag and a purse. I was told by one SAA staffer that I was not allowed to carry on a purse and a suitcase. This was not a large purse it was a small handbag. I have never in all of my travels been told that I may not carry a purse with my wallet and passport. She actually made me open my suitcase and put the purse inside of it so that I literally had one item to bring on the plane. Utter nonsense. The next leg departing JNB was 1.5 hours late no explanation was given at all. This despite the fact that later scheduled flights to Cape Town were leaving in the meantime. Generally SAA is decent but the Zambia experience was extremely off putting.

Washington DC to Johannesburg. Airbus A340-300. Great plane I found the seat width better than on the A340-600. Sat at the Bulkhead row 35. Great legroom. Ground staff were friendly. Excellent cabin crew. Took off 10 minutes early and arrived 45 minutes ahead of schedule. Very smooth flight. Stop at Dakar was only 50 minutes instead of the scheduled 90 minutes - 2 hours. We were a National team tour group of 105 people and not a single piece of luggage went missing or was damaged.

Good on board service.

### South African Airways customer review
Johannesburg to Cape Town. Good flight on time all good until we arrived. Waited at luggage carousel until no more bags and then visit lost luggage counter. It turns out the pilot ordered 50 bags to be left because of bad weather. Presumably to avoid lodging more fuel since it was only a 2 hour flight on a 737. SAA could have told us when we arrived and not gone through the lost baggage charade. The one guy left to deal with 50 angry people did a fantastic job and bags were delivered next day as promised.

Johannesburg to New York JFK direct flight. Airbus A340-600. Great plane and pilots. Seats not bad at all I sat at the row 45 emergency exit. Check in went quickly since we had already got our boarding passes with our connecting domestic flight check in. Ground staff were friendly. After take off we were served drinks then a nice dinner. Between dinner and breakfast the cabin crew offered refreshments at least 5 times. They stopped at nothing to rectify the few personal entertainment systems that was out of order even moving passengers to other seats. Smooth flight took off on time and arrived 45 minutes early.

Took off 10 minutes early and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule.

Flew back MUN-JHNB SA265. Full flight. Whole in-flight system was in-operative as well as the seats. Meals was good and service is friendly. Was able to sleep on the flat-bed as the seats can be operated manually but it was a struggle and noisy for the staff to set up. I think the staff service was good in the challenging circumstances but thought poorly of the equipment of the aircraft not being in working order. Despite the apologies from the staff on board I think an apology from head-office is required.

### South African Airways customer review
Our flight from JFK to JNB was delayed 9 hours due to mechanical problems costing us an entire day in Cape Town. Neither my wife or I had a functional entertainment unit for the 14 hour flight. Our connecting flight from JNB to Hoedspruit (near Kruger) was delayed by 4 hours due to another mechanical failure costing us an entire game drive on Safari. After emailing SAA regarding these issues they offered to provide a small discount on future purchases from their dysfunctional airline. While staff were polite in person they regularly demonstrated no awareness of the reasoning or status of long delay issues. I will never fly SAA again. British Airways is certainly worth the very slight difference in cost.

### South African Airways customer review
We have always travelled with SAA between LHR and JHB on our visits to family. Our last trip was different the crew were so much more pleasant this time. In the past one or two looked as if it was a chore to deal with us. This time there was always a smile and cheery banter. Our only complaint was that in both directions we had problems with the IFE no sound or it sounded as if it was under water. Despite re-booting we never did get it right. We've rebooked our next flight already and look forward to it.

JFK-JNB May 20th. I have always enjoyed flying SAA. I have found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. This trip was no different. Entertainment food and drinks were good. I have always had a hard time sleeping on the plane so I will often go and chat with the crew in the galley while stretching. They have always been so friendly and easy to chat with. The only unpleasant part of this last trip was that I was sitting next to a rather large woman who was not very polite. She raised the arm rest between us and came spilling on to me. Not very pleasant on a 15 hour flight. I still tried to be nice though and make some small talk. I will be flying with SAA again on Sunday July 1st and look forward to their hospitality.

Flight: In last month. First we had a very hectic check in and boarding - though we reached the airport 2 hrs before our flight we had nearly missed our flight because of the slowness in immigration procedures! But I would like to thank to staff at the boarding gate A24 who allowed us in though boarding was closed. Was expecting a wonderful flight in the business class cabin from Johannesburg to Mauritius but both me and my husband were disappointed. The hostess seemed to be forcing herself to smile at us and we had to wait a long time before being served! Moreover the vegetarian food was of extremely low quality. Nevertheless my husband has travelled economy in domestic SA flights and he was happy with the service. It all depends on the crew.

OR Tambo to Accra Ghana. SA 52 18 June 2012 Airbus 340 bad vibration on take off the landing at Accra was good. My seat was in class: Y very cramped difficult to get up out of the seat. Only screens from roof for inflight entertainment on a 6 hours flight. The food is not bad - very spicy curry beef or spicy chicken or vegetarian. The coffee after the meals is cold no hot milk. The chicken wrap was good only juice available. You must plastic wrap your suitcase for R50.00 per case.

DUR-JNB-HKG. Ground staff at Durban were great giving me the emergency exit on a brand new A320 plenty of leg room and friendly staff. Upgraded to business using Voyager miles while in JNB airport for the Hong Kong leg got row 3.The ground staff in JNB are usually unfriendly and unhelpful but this couldn't be further from the truth on this trip. Awesome service from them. Then from the moment we stepped on board the crew couldn't have been more friendly but as always very safety conscience. Updates from the flight deck are always good on SAA and this trip was no different. We were well informed and warned in advance about bad weather. Food was good and entertainment good. The lie flat seat was great and I slept for 7hrs. Woke for breakfast and landing. The flight crew let me into the cockpit to take photos and went out of their way to explain all the goings on in the flight deck and gave me the weather print out as a souvenir.

My wife and I flew with our 12 month old son from London to Jo'Burg on an overnight and thanks to the wonderful staff it was a brilliant experience They allocated us the whole centre row so our son could lay down to sleep and we're very attentive throughout in regards to his milk. The food for adults was great as were the drinks All in all highly recommended.

We travelled from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls Victoria Falls to Cape Town Cape Town to Nelspruit Nelspruit to Durban and then finally Durban to Johannesburg. We had exceptional flight service on all our flights. Friendly flight attendants and prompt service. Our only complaint would be with the check-in counters where staff were often less than friendly. Please note this was not on every check-in but was more memorable at most counters than not. Overall excellent service and was pleased with all our flights!

Heathrow to Johannesburg. Disappointed to find that although I had asked for an aisle seat due to a medical condition I was put into a window seat both ways. Meals and drinks were ok! Inflight entertainment was fine but having got to JHB found that they had sent my luggage to Cape Town I was not amused. Took 3 days to get it back requiring multiple phone calls. When I asked them for another quote for a flight this coming December they couldn't even do that I'm now comfortably booked with Lufthansa SAA certainly know how to lose customers.

Economy flight on 11 May New York to Johannesburg - 14 hour flight. Comfortable seats great entertainment system reasonable food. But it was the crew that made it. Pleasant efficient and helpful. Regular visits with water and snacks between the two main meals - and they kept the toilets clean. They were excellent.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB JNB-ELS return. Connection boarding pass issued in London which made it much quicker and less stressful. Staff very attentive throughout the flights offering plenty of fluids. Food good and nice to be given better cutlery than most other airlines. Touch screen entertainment much better and easier to use. All in all I was very impressed and will fly SAA as my first choice of airline.

### South African Airways customer review
CPT-LHR - 27 April. New airbus plane - very comfortable with great IFE. Cape Town based crew - excellent and far better than the ones I have met recently when flying from Johannesburg. Good food and bar service. On time. A very pleasant 12 hour flight.

### South African Airways customer review
I booked a seat for my wife and a bassinet for son to fly from South Africa to Perth Australia. We were not given the bassinet as promised and paid for my wife had to hold my son in her lap for the duration of the flight. Because of this she was not able to enjoy her meals not able to sleep comfortably and even had to hand my son to a stranger so she could go to the toilet. We were also told that since she had an infant the pram would be "last on first off". This was not true she then still had to carry him for another hour or so get though customs and only got the pram while collecting her luggage. Staff were absolutely useless and unhelpful.

### South African Airways customer review
ORT-JFK - a long tiring flight and I am ashamed of the service that passengers received from cabin staff. All staff had the same bad attitude could not smile or assist in anyway. At the beginning of the flight it was mentioned that they were on duty for the duration of the flight but I have to say that after the initial meal had been served we did not see them again until an hour or so before they handed out breakfast. My 4 year old grand daughter became hungry during the long interval between the two meals we were told - sorry there is nothing that they can offer to eat! If I had known this we would have taken snacks onboard with us.

### South African Airways customer review
NB-JNB-PER Return in Business Class. All 4 flights were excellent. The service was very good and food was also very good (though many dishes ex. JNB repeat). The lie flat seats are even better now with the mattress pad. Slept a solid 7-8 hours on each long haul flight. The crew were very attentive. In JNB they need fast track for J passengers.

### South African Airways customer review
CPT-JNB. Business class seat 2A 737-800 flight lasting just around 2 hours. Seat comfortable similar layout to European airlines for short haul business class. Boarding quick although due to luggage offload flight delayed. Small meal served but nothing like the food served on SAA international flights. Flight arrived on time however spent another 30 min getting to the remote stand and bussed to the terminal which left little time to make my connection. Perhaps not worth the extra from economy fare!

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-CPT A330-200 Business Class. Check-in at Heathrow simple and quick used *A lounge in terminal 1 which was fine. Boarding by class and seat number again very quick seat was pretty comfortable both for sitting relaxing and sleeping; however the cabin did seem a little cramped! I had dinner and breakfast and I must say both the crew service and food where top notch. Flight arrived 10 min early baggage was on the belt shortly after immigration! My only real gripe is the VOD for the 3rd time on a SAA flight my monitor did not work. Crew tried to re-boot but nothing.

### South African Airways customer review
OR JNB to JFK. Airbus A346. Equipment was spotlessly clean and attendants were quite attentive. The food was as good as airline food can be perhaps a little better. Seats were very comfortable. The flight on time. Check-in was done expeditiously and personnel were efficient. I feel that this is an above-average airline and would not hesitate to fly SAA again.

### South African Airways customer review
J'burg to Washington DC. 18 hours of pure hell squashed into a tiny seat and could not lower the armrests without cutting into my side. I am not very large or overweight but could not get the slightest bit comfortable. The aisles were so narrow it was almost impossible to move around without bumping into a seated passenger.

### South African Airways customer review
Somebody needs to place a warning about SAAs practice to overbook flights. In my case we are a family of 4 and on a flight from Johannesburg to Windhoek we were held by staff at the check-in counter for 45 minutes to ensure that we could not reach the gate in time. Only when the gate was closed we got our boarding pass. Only after many hours of discussion with the transfer desk and the supervisor on duty we got the hotel voucher and a flight the following day. At the hotel we encountered many fellow passengers who were bumped from their flights to London and Frankfurt including families with small children.

### South African Airways customer review
Johannesburg-Washington DC through Senegal. This 18 hour flight would have been so much better had there been any leg room at all. I am only 5'3" and my knees were jammed against the seat in front. When the seat in front was reclined it was only a few inches from my face so I could not watch the video screen without reclining my seat as well. There was no food left by the time they reached my row for breakfast so we had bits and pieces put together for us. Flight over from JFK direct to Johannesburg was much better!

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB-CPT-LHR. Mainly business except domestic flight in economy. Flights were good and service exceptional. Flight out to Johannesburg - very attentive service each passenger in cabin addressed by surname flat beds very good with bedding supplied food good as well with IFE - although could be wider variety. Cabin full but staff and service levels high. Domestic flight JNB-CPT was excellent. Hot meal served and good drinks. CPT-LHR on new A330-200 was also very restful and flat beds too. Excellent IFE and good food with winces. SAA have really upped their service levels and this bodes well for the future.

### South African Airways customer review
The amount of room I had in economy was unbelievable I could not move my legs or arms without hitting the lady sitting next to me. Flight attendants come around a lot with drinks and food was on time. Food wasn't great. On the return the inflight entertainment was pretty good. You could select movies/TV shows/games with a touch screen. Seats were so uncomfortable I had to bunch up my blanket and sit on that to make it not hurt so much.

### South African Airways customer review
Perth to Cape Town. Characterised by IFE not working on some seats. Unfriendly staff. Not possible to pre- book seat even if booking was done on Qantas. The long 6 hour wait for connecting flights in Johannesburg means that you might as well use another carrier that flies into Cape Town such as Singapore Emirates or Malaysia from Perth.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB-PLZ return. You know what you will get with SAA on this route: pleasant attentive staff good food and wine and the bonus of covers for the bed. Only two tiny gripes. I do not like the LHR Star Alliance lounge and the food on domestic flights is trying to be too fancy.

### South African Airways customer review
Johannesburg to Nairobi. No complaints. Wish that the lounge had some real food rather than day old vac- packed sandwiches. Inflight service ok happy to serve drinks on request; food while tasty was tiny in proportions. Despite having star alliance gold status bags not tagged which meant long wait in NBO.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-CPT. The flight was full yet the cabin crew worked fast and efficiently. A small sandwich and a piece of cake were served. Beverages were also available including a bottle of water. I am 1.94m tall and I could stretch my legs thanks to the 34'' seat pitch. IFE only displayed the flight information on the short flight.

### South African Airways customer review
Johannesburg to Heathrow - delayed for 4.5 hours. Staff at the gate were either ill informed or chose to give intentional mis-information. There was a problem with a catering supplier. Rather than addressing the problem they allowed the problem to linger for over 6 hours causing huge inconvenience to many passengers. Not only was I delayed but missed my flight. Once onboard we were offered a flimsy and insincere apology.

### South African Airways customer review
Cape Town to London. Nice touches made the 12 hour flight bearable: lots of drinks rounds through the night - bottles of water and cartons of juice refresher towels handed out prior to breakfast and complimentary hand cream in the lavatories. Crew were excellent very attentive and service with a smile.

### South African Airways customer review
London to Cape Town. Online check-in worked well no queues at bag drop lots of desks open and plenty of staff. Boarding well organised and departure on-time. Pristine cabin on new A330-200. Legroom was good even when the passenger in front reclined. Seats were quite firm although this was easily remedied with a couple of extra cushions. Warm welcome from Cabin Crew. Comfort bags handed out. Excellent bar service choice of 3 entrées for dinner which was excellent in quantity and quality. Hot Breakfast equally good. Large 10 inch personal TVs and a wide selection of movies and TV shows on demand. All-in-all an excellent flight.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-BOM-JNB Business Class. SAA Baobab lounge quiet due to mid morning departure. Good choice of snacks and drinks offered. On time departure. Pre-take off drinks offered. Food of good quality and quantity. Seat very comfortable which converts to a lie flat bed. Padded mattress and duvet provided. Cabin crew pleasant kept the cabin tidy and offered refreshments. BOM-JNB: On time departure. Did not have dinner due to departure time. Again cabin and bathrooms tidy and clean. Landed early. Entertainment on demand adequate with a good selection.

### South African Airways customer review
NBO-JNB-NBO in Economy Class B737-800 both ways. Both flights on time with friendly and efficient service from the cabin crew. I had pre-ordered a low-carbohydrate meal. Out of Nairobi this request was carried out. On the return flight again I received a tray with cake and crackers and the main course was a serving of white rice and beans. The cabin attendant seemed to have absolutely no idea what the problem was. IFE consisted of the same movie on both flights even though the inflight magazine advertised different movies into and out of Johannesburg on the 737.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-CPT-LHR economy class. Southbound flight was excellent thanks to the professional and enthusiastic cabin crew. Informative announcements from the flight deck helped. The return flight was not up to the same standard service was adequate they did the minimum with no enthusiasm. Overall though a good experience and SAA remain my preferred carrier on this route.

### South African Airways customer review
Sao Paulo to Johannesburg. Not very friendly staff (two male flight attendants) dinner was pushed to be finished less than 2 hours after take-off after five passengers no beef only chicken and salmon. Did not notice any staff walking around the cabin during the night no beverages were offered. Breakfast also done in a rush just before landing. Nobody helped with bed linen etc. Quite sour service.

### South African Airways customer review
I was seated in 7D. I found the seat very comfortable and spacious. Staff were extremely courteous and well groomed. The paid attention to our requests with a smile. The food was tasty and very good. Although it was a 16 hrs 20 mins flight the time passed quickly. The lie flat bed was very appropriate and the blankets helped make the seat softer.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB-RCB-JNB-MQP-JNB-LHR. All flights on time. A330 on international legs leg room fine IFE and service good. Dash 8s and RJ85s on internal flights. Very good service on these short sectors top marks for SA Express juice water beer and snack on 1hr 15 min flight.

### South African Airways customer review
JFK-CPT via JNB return. Equipment was Airbus A340-600 for all legs of the trip. Economy class. Plane was about 70% full both ways on JFK-JNB portion fully booked for CPT-JNB legs. Cabin crew very professional. If the flight between JFK and JNB were full I think the experience would be unbearable. The food was good; water wine and beer constantly on offer. Very tight connection on the return through JNB but SAA staff jumped through hoops to make sure all NYC bound passengers made it to the flight in time. In all cases luggage was already on the carousel by the time I got to it.

### South African Airways customer review
Booked on a direct flight to Cape Town from LHR. They changed it to go via JHB saying flight was off. I suddenly found flight was back on and demanded to be put back on the direct flight. They declined. They did put me back on the direct flight to Cape Town they also put us in First Class Lounge as a gesture of goodwill. Cabin Crew are polite but nothing more.

### South African Airways customer review
Johannesburg-Durban return. Flew first in a brand new 320-200 Airbus and return on a rather dull 737. This short flight time allows for a quick snack and drink. Adequate service plane on time and good and clear communication from the flight-deck.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-IAD-JNB old dirty plane blankets smelt very limited choice of movies. On return the flight was cancelled due to technical issues gate staff called transit police at IAD a few times when passengers started asking questions about reasons for the delay it turned out they cancelled this flight 3 days in a row.

### South African Airways customer review
Johannesburg to Munich. Specifically requested exit row seats and got them. Two of our seats were faulty and couldn't recline all three our TV's and sound systems were broken. Despite numerous requests they refused to move us saying the flight was full when in fact there a lot of open seats. On our return from Munich to Johannesburg it was even worse. It was really busy and noisy. The entire row had no inflight entertainment because all the TV's were broken. Once again we told we couldn't be moved because of lack of seats. We will look at stop-over options rather than going SAA again.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB-CPT return. Flights were on time. Modern Airbus with good entertainment system. Food edible - even served a hot breakfast. Hot meal on domestic CPT-JNB flight. Wine very passable. Cabin crew friendly enough but not wildly efficient. Found seat cushions a littler hard but otherwise the couple of inches extra legroom over BA very welcome. Check-in at all airports quick and hassle free although probably helped by checking in online.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-HKG Business (Premier Class). Inflight entertainment problems. Staff not available poor compared to other airlines. Had similar poor and rude cabin crew on a flight to Washington DC in economy. Frequent Flyer Programme (Voyager) not user friendly. I cannot recommend SAA.

### South African Airways customer review
After reading so many rave reviews on various sites I was quite disappointed. The economy class seats were very tight for even a short flight so imagine a 16.5 hour flight. Flight attendants were not very pleasant not even one friendly smile from any of them. The food is average plane food. The flights left on time but that is probably the best I can say about them.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-LHR on the new airbus. Seats were roomy and comfy staff polite and friendly and inflight entertainment system outstanding. We had terrible turbulence throughout the flight but the captain was informative and reassuring and everyone remained calm. Food not great but otherwise excellent.

### South African Airways customer review
I travel quite frequently on business locally in SA. SAA have a much younger fleet than other rivals food and beverage service is always good. Most importantly they have friendly and courteous staff. My last flight DUR- JNB-DUR both ways on a clean A319. My next flight to PE is also booked on SAA.

### South African Airways customer review
New York-Maputo via JNB. I was surprised by the level of quality. The food from New York was lovely. On the return it was still good but a little disappointed with the choices. The cabin crew are good and they show concern towards the safety and comfort of passengers. The seat in economy class is comfortable and provides enough space for the feet. The entertainment system has a variety of choices. A pleasant flight.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB-PLZ-JNB-LHR. Four flights in ten days on four different aircraft (332 738 CR7 and 346). Both internal flights excellent: on time crew efficient and friendly aircraft clean food decent. Long-haul flights a mixed bag. Outbound on SAA's newest A330-200: aircraft spotless IFE superb (aside from moving map not working) arrived 30 minutes early but crew surly and dinner mediocre (good wine though). Breakfast was better. I found the A330 seats very hard. Return leg on older A340-600: delayed 30 minutes seats a little more comfortable IFE worked fine after initial problems. Dinner much better but breakfast mediocre crew much more friendly than on the LHR-JNB leg. Overall would travel with SAA again - if they could iron out the inconsistencies this would be a pretty good economy experience.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-CPT return on the new A330. My wife and I have flown many times on this route over recent years and have always enjoyed Business Class. Service is excellent the IFE provides a wide choice of the latest films and the menu has been refreshed as well.

### South African Airways customer review
Fantastic service from Perth to Johannesburg in Business Class. The plane to Johannesburg appeared to be older one and not the new Airbus I thought it would be. However the flight from Johannesburg to Perth was the new airbus and what a difference that made. The cabin staff were extremely courteous and efficient both ways. However wondering why on the Perth to Johannesburg flight the cabin crew kept the toilet at the top of the business class section to themselves - leaving the rest of the business class passengers with two toilets. This did not happen on the return flight. Food was delicious both ways. All in all a very pleasant flight.

### South African Airways customer review
PER-JNB For an economy flight it was very good. The new airbus is much better than the older Boeing 747's. After a poor BA flight LON-SIN-PER this was a welcome relief. Inflight staff have improved a lot since my last SAA flight 18 months ago.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-PLZ (Pt Elizabeth) and CPT-JNB in October 2011 both segments in domestic Business Class-two wonderful flights. JNB-PLZ in B737-800 fitted with wider seats and more legroom in Business class. If you have to travel from Cape Town to Joburg book SA346 flight in the afternoon at around 3pm. They use an A340-600 from the Cape to JNB and you'll sit - or lie - in SAA flat bed seats for a domestic flight of just 90 mins. If SAA only managed to teach their ground staff the same efficiency and friendliness that their onboard crews have I would have rated both trips a10 instead 9. I've rarely met more attentive polite and friendly flight attendants than on SA flights. Some airport staff on the other hand prefer to give you the impression as if they were forced to work there. Slow rude and constantly chatting and/or nagging with their work mates. Lounges in CPT and JNB both recently refurbished and very nice.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB on A340 in Business and flight was generally good. Friendly crew food adequate in quality and quantity very good. Wine excellent. Seat relatively comfortable but not fully flat bed. Minor delay with baggage collection at JNB.

### South African Airways customer review
IAD-JNB-CPT. Was able to upgrade to Business Class at IAD with very efficient helpful employee. The reason that I rated the airline down was the baggage service in JNB. On the flight from JNB-CPT we had a two hour layover. This was enough time for the baggage dept to break my TSA lock riffle through belongings dump zippered bags and leave a mess. I know enough not to pack valuables in a checked bag so nothing was worth stealing. Two other members of my tour group had similar experiences. On my return home again from JNB the zippers on my suitcase were broken/stripped. I have heard that this airport has a reputation for this. What a welcome and farewell to South Africa!

### South African Airways customer review
Business Class SAA code share with Emirates DXB-JNB-DUR return. All in all there were 7 Business Class passengers the service and the IFE on the 777-300ER was excellent the food was good the seating quite narrow. The service in JNB and DUR was nothing less than terrible.

### South African Airways customer review
CPT-JNB-FRA return. As I did a 36 hour turnaround I had the same crew both ways on the long haul sector. Friendly attentive service and good food selection. Cabin of A340-600 is beginning to show its age but space and lie-flat facility is fine. Good Lufthansa lounge in FRA and well-organised boarding with separate gate for Business Class. Boarding in JNB as usual poorly organised with Business Class pax scrumming along with everyone. Small SAA Business Class arrivals lounge at JNB has excellent showering facilities. For me at least SAA has raised its service levels and has been consistently good all year.

### South African Airways customer review
First time on SAA and I was pleasantly surprised the seats in Economy Class provided generous legroom/width and recline. The entertainment system excellent although the screen could have been larger. I didn't have time to watch all the movies I had set out to see despite the long flight. Good food plenty of snacks in the back available all night and friendly flight attendants that explained the movie system. Landed about 30 mins early.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-LVI via JNB. Clean A340-300 good IFE food and crew. My only complaint was cramped cabin. JNB to LVI was on a clean A319 with more legroom than A340. Return from LLW to LHR via JNB and once again I was surprised. LLW to JNB was on a new 737-800 food was tasty and crew friendly.

### South African Airways customer review
DUR-JHB-LHR return. FA's were proactive although some surly. Planes are old but well maintained and spacious. IFE is useless (no personal TV on some flights) but when you do get its fantastic. Out of 52 flights with SAA only 1 has been delayed.

### South African Airways customer review
CPT-LHR return. Both flights on new A330. Excellent seat comfort and lie-flat. Cabin very quiet up front even on take-off. Food very good both ways and crew attentive and friendly without being invasive. The only thing I'd mark down was the fact that no menus were loaded in London. I've flown a lot on SAA in the last 3 months and have noticed a marked improvement in food quality and variety. Passenger embarkation at LHR was clearly communicated and orderly something that should be noted by JNB ground staff. A pity the Star Alliance lounge at LHR is so tatty and uninviting.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JHB-LHR Business Class. Outward leg on A330 and back on A340. Both flights fairly uneventful. Cabin crew on outward leg were not especially welcoming but on return were the opposite. Found seat on A330 outward leg more comfortable in sleeping configuration than the A340 which seemed to be a bit hard. Did not bother with IFES although there appeared to be something wrong with it on the flight back to LHR. Meal service was fine both ways - quality of food was not bad. Both flights departed and arrived on time.

### South African Airways customer review
Flew SAA in Business from CPT to JNB. As we were connecting on from JNB we wanted to get our purchases checked by customs so we could get tax back. We allowed 1 hr for this but it took all of 5 mins so we were at check in 3 hrs before our flight. Although there was an earlier flight with seats SA wanted to charge us an extra US$300 each for the change. So we stayed on our existing flight. Check in was smooth. The SA domestic lounge in CPT is large. Not much on offer for food other then toast and sandwiches. There is also a bar and self serve for soft drinks. Our plane was parked underneath the lounge and we saw it being boarded yet no announcement was made in the lounge. Off we went and were the last to board. The plane was a 737. 2-3 across in J. Comfortable seat. A hot breakfast was served with yoghurt cereal and croissants. Was a good and filling meal. Also offered was fresh orange juice and tea/coffee. SA does not offer a hot towel service. Overall service was good. Bags took a long time to get delivered. Priority tagging did not work.

### South African Airways customer review
JFK-JNB round trip and during that trip flew round trip to Victoria Falls. I had reservations and seat assignments long in advance. I did not get my assigned seat on any flight I took. I tried to sign in online and could not do it. I called the SAA office and they said I could not do that since the reservations were made by a travel agent. I check in 3 hrs early at JNB and found that my seat had been given away again. All airbus seats are excruciating in economy on a long flight. Costs matched all other airlines.

### South African Airways customer review
Perth to Johannesburg. First contact at check-in was not good as someone in SAA moved my pre-assigned seat for a friend of theirs thus splitting up my brother and I. The Airbus A340-200 was showing its age. The lavatories were in poor repair with missing door handles. The only entertainment was on a bulkhead video screen- with only 2 movies shown on an 11 hour sector- and limited audio choice as most of the channels did not work. Our arrival in Johannesburg was nearly 1 hour early so we had to wait on the tarmac while a ground crew was found. (In SAA's defence it was 4:30am so most staff had yet to arrive at the airport.) On the plus side the meals were generous and the cabin crew were polite. They did regular drinks walks during the long night.

### South African Airways customer review
PER-JNB-MRU return. A340-200 except for MRU-JNB (737-800). Good legrooms on all flights. Seats on the hard side for a 10 hour+ flight but appreciated the winged headrest on the Recaro seats. Food and drinks slightly above standard for economy. Crew professional throughout and very friendly on the JNB-MRU leg. Did not notice many drinks run but bottled water provided. Worst aspect of flights was the outdated IFE.

### South African Airways customer review
Perth-Johannesburg back to Perth. Room for improvement. There were no IFE screens. The service was hurried and for the large part inattentive. The food was okay and the only positive was the wine.

### South African Airways customer review
Johannesburg-Windhoek-Johannesburg on a brand new A330-200 from JNB. The choice of 2 hot meals for a 2 hr flight is remarkable. Food was good with a friendly cabin crew. Return in a B737-800 with the same quality in service. It was my first experience with SAA and I enjoyed it from start to finish.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-BA return. The trip to BA was good. IFE was good with each seat having it's own. Spacious seats. Enjoyed the flight. The return flight was an older aircraft with no individual IFE. Communication from flight deck was very informative. Food was reasonable. Okay flight.

### South African Airways customer review
DXB-JNB and on to DUR. The Dubai-Johannesburg was on an Emirates code share flight so I will not review it here but the JNB-DUR was on a proper SAA flight and they have always delivered a high quality product they are attentive and extremely helpful even with the meal. We are Muslims but forgot to ask for a Muslim meal but their flight attendant brought us a vegetarian choice from Economy Class.

### South African Airways customer review
The seats are so tight that it is practically impossible to open your legs while seated and so close together with the seat in front of you that you can't stretch your leg. There were no individual TV's only one TV at the start of the aisle with the worst quality I have ever seen. The fight attendants were rude impersonal and didn't care if people called them or not. The food was bland; tasteless.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-LUN and LLW-JNB in Economy. Overall a very mediocre experience. FA's on both legs were rushed and abrupt and service lacked any warmth or personal attention. There was no recognition of Star Alliance Gold Card holders; no priority boarding in either JNB or LLW no priority luggage tags and no lounge access in LLW. Flights were very expensive (admittedly you don't have much choice) and service did not meet expectations.

### South African Airways customer review
Where do I start? I fly business to South Africa and SAA is the worst. The flight crew was horrible and on every leg you had to beg them for service. From JFK-JNB I sat next to a SAA rep who noticed my lack of attention from the flight crew. It gets worse. I tried to return early back to the USA and no one over the phone will help you in South Africa. I was told to go to the airport which I did for 8 hrs. I was finally put on a flight from JNB back to JFK about 30 mins before flight after waiting and being extorted to pay almost 700 in fees. Who can you complain to in JNB? No one was willing to help. I got my boarding pass then noticed I was given a coach seat. My bags were pulled from the plane as I refused to fly coach on nearly a $10k ticket. They put me on a flight for the next day (my original flight).

### South African Airways customer review
My 2 year old son and I flew SAA in April 2011 they put us on a flight that had no TV screens in the back of the seats! Therefore a nightmare to keep a 2year old in a seat and entertained! TV's in the aisles is for the 80's not for the millennium! I'm not impressed at all and didn't feel that the food was kid appropriate either. Without having PTV screens I would rather have flown via DOHA than pay for a direct flight from London-CPT without TV for a 2year old! Staff were poor and uninterested food tasteless. The entire journey left a bad taste in my mouth. SAA has definitely deteriorated!

### South African Airways customer review
We flew to JHB Economy class overnight from LHR during Easter and had a superb experience. We liked the tasteful interior of the plane the multi-choice entertainment available on your own screen the air stewards' outfits and friendliness and the food much better than previous journeys to South Africa using KLM Air France or Emirates. The best part was we were upgraded to Business Class on our return journey -- what a wonderful experience that was for all of us lying flat down in bed overnight flying the length of Africa! I was probably the only one in Biz class taking pictures for keepsakes. Well done SAA and thank you!

### South African Airways customer review
Flew Business Class from Windhoek-Johannesburg on their new Airbus A330. The interior looks and feels quite new and all works great. They have full lie down beds which we didn't use as the flight was only 2 hours. The seats are very comfortable though with various seating possibilities. Service and food was 10 out of 10 but I wouldn't expect any less for Business Class. Would love to fly on Business Class on the A330 again for a long haul flight and I can only recommend it.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-PER. No PTV screen general screens provided but with poor resolution for screens. Service after dinner was very haphazard. Food choices were limited.

### South African Airways customer review
Domestic flights JNB/CPT return. The connecting flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town after a long haul from Frankfurt was fine. As it was midday a hot meal was served and the staff were very friendly and responsive. Drinks were good. SAA has a well earned reputation for hospitality but I think this depends on the crew. On return check in staff very good and facilities at Cape Town International are excellent. Also snack and drinks served. Really no competition for their European counterparts on domestic flights - so much better.

### South African Airways customer review
CPT-JNB-LHR Business. Domestic lounge in CPT poor food and drink offers. Flights all running at least an hour late no information as to why or even boarding when it had started. CPT-JNB staff friendly and motivated but the cabin was unclean. Time consuming transfer Domestic to International at JNB. A346 to LHR was full food and wine selection very good well presented and the service pretty by interested crew not especially welcoming. Seat seemed to have a dip in the centre of the cushion when into flat bed leg space rather old fashioned seat.

PER-JNB-PER many times and SAA mainly uses an A340-200 or A340-300 on this route. This means main screen movies rather than inseat screens with VOD. This week I had two bulkhead seats to myself at the front of economy. The TV above me was so washed out I couldn't see the movies but they were not the latest releases so I tried to sleep instead. The legroom for the bulkhead was less than many economy class cabins. The service was OK. Overall I think SAA is a good airline but not a great airline.

LHR-CPT on A340-200. Seats rock hard the recline didn't work on my seat no PTV screens just one big screen for 40 people. Food tasteless and it was hard to get a drink when you wanted one.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-FRA. Nice lounge in JNB. Very good meal quality and service. Exceptional staff in my opinion. They were always trying to provide attentive and personal service. Would choose SAA again.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB return. Won't comment on delays or economy class space as all much of a muchness whoever you travel with. I found cabin crew to be uninterested in passengers and apart from serving the meals service non existent. Saw a number of people press the button and were not attended. When looking at the route map on the IFE I dont want to spend 4 in every 5 minutes being forced to look at leg exercises.

CPT-Nelspruit . Check in agent very friendly. Through security in no time. BA-146 was very comfortable. 2 flight attendants smiling and professional. Meal was choice of smoked chicken or beef salad - the freshest salad ever eaten aboard. Free booze 2 x drinks run dessert etc. Pleasant 2hr flight.

### South African Airways customer review
Shocking A343 aircraft being used between Perth and Johannesburg - all signs are in Spanish and English. Broke down on take-off from JNB resulting in 3.5 hr delay with no disembarkation allowed. Very poor space between seats. Poor and limited entertainment system.

### South African Airways customer review
Munich to Jo'burg. Friendly check-in small welcome gifts for the night. Good entertainment food and wine. Water at a bar to take whenever you want. Very friendly stewardess.

### South African Airways customer review
PER-JNB. After initially booked to fly on a Friday night they cancelled Friday night flights. The aircraft was an old A340 economy class had no seat back entertainment and movies had to be viewed on screens at the front of the cabin. Only one of the screens worked and service after the meal was non existent.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB-LLW return. Really impressed. Economy cabin compares very favourably to British Airways good seat width and leg room and the food was perfectly adequate. Return flight from JNB on a 2 day old A340. Short flights to Lilongwe were fine. All flights were more or less on time and crew professional.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR to Jo'burg and back. Both trips had exceptional cabin service in Business Class and good food and wine. Seat allows a full flat bed and almost any other combination of seat shape you would like. Curiously the bed in the older airbus outbound seemed slightly more comfortable than in the new plane on the return trip. Businesselounges good if a little crowded at Jo'burg but the additional arrivals side lounge at Heathrow was small but very nice with good quality showers available. Highly recommended.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-MPM return. EMB190 (LAM) and A319 (SAA). In first flight was a LAM (Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique) a codeshare SAA/. The plane was new staff was very kindly. The food was good (snack). SAA flight the A319 was new too. Very good the colors of the interior of the plane. The crew was Kindly too.

### South African Airways customer review
London Heathrow to Cape Town - travelled this route a few years a go on A340-600 which was new at the time clean and the IFE system was good. However SAA are now using an old A340-200 which is cramped hard seats with no IFE system in the back of the seat. This is very poor for an expensive airline. The food was appalling only served 1 drink on 11 hour flight.

### South African Airways customer review
Business class return flight from Frankfurt to Johannesburg. The distance between seats is good and seat can be changed to a flat bed. The quality of the blankets is also good. However the entertainment programme is rather poor (choice of movies size of video screen) and the food and friendliness of staff leave a lot room for improvement.

### South African Airways customer review
IAD to Joburg and back to Dakar. Time savings because of the route is unbeatable and the wine selection is excellent. Everything else is very mediocre for an airline that charges that much for its business class tickets. The service is very average. The flat bed is okay but it is not a brand-new seat and no privacy. Food is just okay. SAA needs to improve its reservation/ticket service which seems outdated.

### South African Airways customer review
CPT-JNB-HKG return A340-600. Ground staff efficient and friendly in CPT less so in JNB but not enough to spoil our day. Air crew on all flights professional and efficient. Requested veg meal for our daughter - was onboard for all our flights. All meals were smallish portions of food (Qatar Airways is way better) not the greatest quality but edible. Decent wine selection Moet highly welcome! Did not try the full dinner service on return midnight flight - we had eaten at our hotel earlier so can't comment on it. We found they leave the breakfast service quite late so a bit of a rush trying to get through service and tidy cabin for landing. Duvets are a nice touch flat bed comfortable. Choice of entertainment not as wide as some other airlines but due to it being a mostly night flight and we slept most of the time not an inconvenience. We would use SAA again if the price was competitive. Good timetable for this flight - time change seems to have minimal effect on one's perception of night and day.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB-LHR. Excellent service on both flights. Food and drink good. Clean and comfortable aircraft. Check in a breeze at both airports. Only minor problem IFE had to be reset a couple of times. Far better experience than BA.

### South African Airways customer review
Absolute disappointment of service and aircraft being run between Perth and Johannesburg. This is now an old Iberia plane being used on this popular route? Even the staff do not appreciate all it's problems. Incorrect head sets that do not fit this airline were given to us. Service after dinner is non existent? Same plane on return trip. No music channels for entire flight only movie channel 1 worked and the movie had a consistent horizontal and vertical line through it for entire movie on remote screens - which you can hardly see when lights are on or off. I have used this airline now 8 or 9 times in the last 17 years and seen it deteriorate to pathetic. Qantas need to set better standards than this to code share with this airline and aircraft?

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-CPT business class return. The old A340-200 but service and professionalism of the FA's could not have been better. Food was excellent and the wines. Lie-flat bed was comfortable but use your duvet to lie on and ask for a blanket - makes a huge difference ! Overall both flights were very enjoyable and would certainly fly SAA again.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-CPT-LHR in business. The service was exceptionally bad. IFE very old the loop system meaning we had to wait until the film we wanted to watch had finished before we could view it. SAA say the seats are 180 degrees flat but that is not the case . The flight back wasn't much better and aircraft was older. The only good point was the quality of wine but otherwise very disappointing.

### South African Airways customer review
I've travelled with SAA for 10 years the service is still okay but it is getting increasingly patchy - the price is still at the upper end of the range. The current A340's used for the Cape Town route are a bit dated and seats were fairly uncomfortable (no seat back entertainment systems). The food is generally better (although the outward flight ran out of wine fairly soon after service). The staff are so so - some crew are good others fairly indifferent. On the overnight flight there was a noticeable tendency of individual crew members taking 20+ minutes to change and put on make-up etc in the bathrooms - which is a bit of a cheek! I wouldn't rule out flying with SAA but it's not what it used to be.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB return. I did quite a lot of research before booking these flights checking seat configurations were 2-4-2 and even calling SAA to double check that I could pre reserve seats. After booking I was able to reserve seats on both legs the staff at London reservations were polite and very helpful allocating our preferred seats and even sending a revised itinerary with our seat numbers confirmed. However on checking in we found we had no seats reserved though fortunately we did manage to get window and aisle for the outward leg. I spoke to the service desk at Heathrow to check our seats for the return would still be ok and was assured they would be. On checking in at JNB for our return we were allocated middle row seats when I pointed out that we had reserved seats the clerk showed no interest at all. He told us the flight was full and there were no other seats available however when we boarded the plane we found that there were plenty of empty seats in fact the row in front of us had just one person to 4 seats. The dishonesty and lack of customer care is just staggering.

### South African Airways customer review
Munich-JNB business class. Quite a pleasant experience. Comfortable lie flat seat good entertainment and good food served by very pleasant and efficient staff. Definitely a superior business class. I would definitely fly them again and prefer it over Lufthansa - which I am using on my return journey.

DAR-JHB-WDH and back. All flights punctual efficient check in great seat comfort in Economy good food and friendly service.

### South African Airways customer review
DUR-JNB-HKG. Seat pitch is better than most other carriers. The onboard entertainment was up to date and worked. Seats comfortable and food excellent. B737-800 in near new condition and A340-600 was better. Flight was quite empty so people could move around and most had an empty seat next to them. I kept my emergency exit seats (row 45) which where great. The pilots on both flights gave up to date information on weather in route.

### South African Airways customer review
HKG-JNB-DUR last month A340-300 and 737-800. The entertainment system was great and food good. The best part was the service onboard - staff interacted just enough to make you feel welcome but never intruded. Joburg airport was a breeze with bag drop working. Flight from Joburg to Durban just as good and was upgraded to business class which was great.

### South African Airways customer review
Last time I travelled SAA all was fine except that an age restricted movie was shown (early show) which I could not protect my children (aged 3 and 5) from seeing as they were right in front of the screen and there were no personal tv sets. I was upset about this and complained to the cabin attendants but they said there was nothing they could do. I am due to fly with my children again in July this year on the A340-200 aircraft (no personal TVs) and I will be very upset if the same thing happens. Surely it must be illegal to show an age restricted movie to under-age minors that cannot stopped from seeing the screen when it is right in front of them? Especially when it is gun violence! I would like to support SAA but I feel strongly that there must be a policy on age restricted movies particularly for the early show.

### South African Airways customer review
Star Alliance members should avoid this airline as they do not award miles at the same level as other Star Alliance members give little priority if at all to Star Alliance Gold members and generally provide poor service for flights to and from the US. Nothing but hassles at the Johannesburg airport when checking in items stolen from my luggage that they insisted I check. Also could not understand why they kept seating people beside me when most of the last 10-15 rows were fully empty. Bring extra food because they don't want to feed you.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR to CPT (via JNB) return. All was well on the outbound flight. Food good quality although in very small portions for business class. Flight attendants friendly and professional. Lie flat bed was comfortable but your feet seemed to be higher than your head. Return was delayed due to closure of Heathrow in the December snowstorm. SAA could not have done less to help their passengers. We were left to make our own arrangements for accommodation and meals for three days. The website gave incorrect information as did the helpline in Johannesburg. The staff at Cape Town were impolite and unhelpful. They tried to send me home to London via Frankfurt even though Frankfurt was also closed. Nearly six weeks later they have not replied to emails asking for assistance with making a claim on my personal insurance policy. This airline does nothing but the barest minimum to assist passengers when things go wrong. Their attitude is "we will put you on a flight eventually but in the meantime you are on your own".

### South African Airways customer review
Cape Town to Heathrow. A virtually non-existent entertainment package for a 12 hour flight - one smallish TV mounted at the very front of economy! Unacceptable on a long haul flight!

### South African Airways customer review
I recently flew to London on SAA the most horrendous and stressful experience. I arrived at Johannesburg airport 3.5 hours before take off and went straight to the check-in desk. The queue was already substantial - only one check in desk open for international passengers it took me two hours to check in. I complained to two senior personnel both times they were rude and unhelpful. When I arrived at passport control there was a similar problem. I eventually got to the plane 10 minutes before we were due to take off. We then had to wait as a passenger did not arrive and their luggage had to be removed I realise that was not SAA’s fault but more was to follow. The next delay was due to missing paper work when that eventually arrived we started to taxi to the runway only to stop. We were told there was a problem with one of the engines and had to be towed back to the docking bay to wait for repairs. Running 1.5 hours late we eventually left but the problems did not stop. Early the next morning I called a stewardess as the toilets were not flushing the captain announced some time later that everyone had to use the bathroom as they were going to be locked the mechanism wasn’t working properly. The return trip wasn’t much better the seats very extremely cramped I dropped my book and due to the seat in front being in a reclining position I couldn’t bend down and pick it up. My daughter’s seat wouldn’t recline at all so we had to take it in turns sitting there.

### South African Airways customer review
Johannesburg-Cape Town business class. Long wait to check in despite no one being served in the economy queue or international business curt check in staff no airport information provided. Lounge staff gossiped behind counter with no interest in serving customers over my one hour visit to the lounge. Not greeted when boarded the plane had to hang my own coat up. The first two rows of business had to listen to the air steward vent about a passenger further back at the top of his voice for the first 30 minutes of the flight. Economy style seats with no footrest or entertainment. Nowhere on the SAA website to write any feedback clearly they don't want any! Economy service don't waste the money on Business.

### South African Airways customer review
London to Cape Town Johannesburg to London. First leg so-so with a medium age plane that had an okay entertainment system and fair food - mediocre all around. The return leg was a nightmare. Terrible food rude inattentive service and a virtually non-existent entertainment package for a 12 hour flight - one smallish TV mounted at the very front of economy which played the same movie on this return leg as the incoming leg! 4-star airline? No way!

### South African Airways customer review
Johannesburg-Maputo return Economy. This is a short flight - just over 1 hour but was very happy with level of service offered which included snack (sandwich) and drinks (soft beer wine). Check in at Maputo on way back was quick - although colleagues who checked in later than me complained about the passport control process which was slow. I was in transit on way to Maputo and had to pick up boarding pass at the transfer desk. Luckily I have a Star Alliance Gold Card so was dealt with quickly - due to a new computer system queues were rather long. On both legs the aircraft (A319) was on time.

Business Class LHR-CPT during the snow crisis at Heathrow Airport our booking was for the 20th Dec the first SAA CPT flight out of Heathrow for 4 days. We boarded the A340-200 at 830pm. At 930pm an announcement from Captain advised that water pipes had become frozen and there was leak in the Cargo area - he assured that engineers would ensure the problem was fixed and we could depart that evening. After 6hrs the aircraft it wasn't looking good we would get away that night during those 6hrs cabin crew were extremely attentive served Dinner to passengers. At 3am Captain announced the fault could not be repaired but he had a choice of either cancelling the flight for a complete repair or could depart with no water for the bathrooms and no hot drinks - passengers would need to be co-operative by using bottles of water to empty into the bathroom so they can flush - passengers agreed and we left at 350am. Bathrooms were clean during the whole flight passengers and crew were brilliant in ensuring no health hazard occured. This crew were an absolute credit to SAA kept smiling for the full 12 hour flight. Well done a magnificent caring experience.

DUR-JNB-VFA and LIV-MQP-JNB. Nothing eventful DUR-JNB. JNB-VFA an issue with the luggage meant everyone had to exit the plane to identify their bags and then re-board the aircraft. This obviously led to a delay. LIV-MQP uneventful and on time. MQP-JNB flight was late arriving and when we finally boarded the airconditioning did work.

### South African Airways customer review
Have used South African Airways quite a lot from Heathrow to Cape Town. They have recently changed the planes to older aircraft. No personal TV in economy food dreadful some stewards very helpful but others surly. The one good point is that their economy class is better than British Airways.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-CPT-JNB in Economy. SAA does not treat affiliated Star Gold members as is customary with other airlines in the alliance. For SAA first come their own Voyager members. First leg on 737-800 aircraft old seats no priority boarding chaos on board since two seats where broken and delay of 45 mins without being informed or updated at all. Catering only started after 1 hour. Return on 340-600 aircraft again seating problems double seat assignments resulting in delay. Very disappointed with SAA.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-JNB-LHR. Check in process very quick and through to lounge. Heathrow Star Alliance lounge very poor - dark lighting hard seats - felt like a waiting room at a train station. Very professional cabin crew nice choice of food and excellent wines on offer. Film choice very limited and not on a par with other carriers. Flight made up time and arrived on schedule. As one of the first flights virtually no queue at immigration and bags through quickly. Return flight also on time. Very professional "old school" CSD who personally came round the cabin shaking passengers hands and thanking them for flying SAA - a nice touch. Food and drinks very nice again. Found the lie flat seats a little hard and restrictive width wise. All in all a positive experience.

### South African Airways customer review
The aircraft was clearly very old cramped seats with extremely limited leg room. Drop down tvs overhead not seat back screens. Extremely old films overhead screens were just inches from my head and there was a warning on the back of the seat about this. Could not move my arms easily in order to eat my meal due to the lack of space. Unsmiling surly staff on the outbound flight (UK to Cape Town) better on the way back. Breakfast inedible. Uncomfortable flight with many people clearly unable to sleep. The overhead light would have disturbed other passengers so I couldn't read and with no proper in flight entertainment I simply sat in my seat for 11 hours bored out of my mind.

### South African Airways customer review
Had a wonderful experience on JFK-JNB in business class on the A340 lie flat seats - top notch all round from comfort to food to staff to entertainment.

### South African Airways customer review
JNB-LLW and NBO-JNB economy. First leg okay though food awful and staff abrupt. NBO-JNB was awful - check in staff rude one walking away mid conversation and not returning. What was originally a 2 hour delay became an 8 hour delay - we were kept poorly informed and provided only with juice/water but no proper food.

### South African Airways customer review
My thanks to airline retrieving wrapping and delivering luggage to me when it did not make a connecting flight out of Dulles - also to the ground staff at OR Tambo who were courteous and reassuring to all of us. The food on that flight was awful and I am not a fussy eater. The food was served at local time 15h00 less than two hours before touch-down at OR Tambo and quite ridiculous as a lunch - especially since it was about 8 hours after breakfast. The cabin was darkened until that time (15h00) even though it had been daylight for hours. Surely one does not expect an 8-hour sleep after breakfast when we had already had about 4 or 5 hours after leaving Washington. Most ridiculous the out of date video that played before touchdown was long and complicated and did not even mention Gautrain.

### South African Airways customer review
LHR-Cape Town return. Flight to Cape Town was excellent FAs could not have done more. Seat pitch a little short in flat bed position. Star Alliance lounge at LHR is very average. Return CPT to LHR service no more than efficient and not with a smile. Food average throughout. South African Airways lounge is poor as are refreshments on offer. Inflight entertainment is poor and old fashioned on A340-200.
