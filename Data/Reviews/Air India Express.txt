### "impressed by service of ground staff"
I was highly impressed by the service of two ground staff of Air India Express in the Hindon Airport while checking in my luggage's and getting them scanned. Being a senior citizen, and the airport was new to me I was most confused with the practices of the Airport. Following two staff helped me and facilitated my journey Ms.Komala, Ms.Urvasi

### "they will weigh cabin baggage"
People should avoid flying with Air india Express. Unprofessional ground staff do not expect anything beyond cheap hospitality. They would find ways to extract money from if you dared to fly with me. On the check in counter they will weigh cabin baggage ask 2k for 1.5kg extra in ur carry on baggage and give u some lame excuse.

### "My worst flight experience"
Not Verified |  My worst flight experience from Delhi to Indore (11th April 2025) I had one of the most frustrating and exhausting travel experiences on 11th April 2025, while flying from Delhi to Indore. My flight was originally scheduled to depart at 6:00 PM. However, what followed was a disaster0. Initially, we were told the flight would be delayed to 7:00 PM, then it was pushed to 8:20 PM. Eventually, the departure time kept getting postponed to 10:00 PM, then midnight, and finally to 5:20 AM the next day. The staff provided no clarity or transparency throughout the ordeal. Each time, a new excuse was given, and we were simply left waiting, confused and helpless. To make things worse, there was no proper communication from the crew. No accommodation was arranged, nor was any real assistance offered to passengers who were forced to sit at the airport the entire night. We were repeatedly told that the incoming flight had taken off from Chandigarh and would reach soon — but that turned out to be completely false. They failed to provide us any kind of accommodation. This was not just a delay; it was a reflection of extremely poor airline management, untrained staff, and lack of regard for customer comfort.

### "not accountable for any damage"
No proper communication and very casual approach. Firstly the luggage bag went missing and upon receiving back it was damaged and torn and the contents of the bag were exposed. It was evident that the damage was due to mishandling. They refused to escalate the complaint and provide with a complaint number. Further when it was emailed, they said they are not accountable for any damage to luggage bag.

### "My baggage was missed"
Not Verified |  I had a terrible experience with Air India Express due to their sheer negligence. My baggage was missed during my trip, and the airline showed absolutely no responsibility in addressing the issue. Despite multiple attempts to reach them via calls and emails, there was no proper response from their end. After three days of frustration and conflicting reasons from different airports, they finally located my baggage. However, instead of delivering it, I was forced to collect it from Bangalore airport while returning from my trip. Their lack of coordination, accountability, and customer service is shocking. Air India Express clearly does not understand or care about the plight of its passengers. The level of carelessness and mismanagement is unacceptable. I would strongly advise travelers to think twice before choosing this airline. Worst experience ever!

### "the worst service provider"
These are the worst service provider. My flight was delayed to 6:40 PM initially from 5:45 initial time and there was no communication till I reached the airport baggage drop counter. Now again my flight was delayed to 7:20 pm. I had a connecting Train to my hometown scheduled at 11:05 PM from Howrah station. I have planned the ticket and my journey two months in advance and booked the tickets. Now because of your fault I am at discomfort. My train is missed and I am in a town where I donot know anybody. It is ultimately the passenger who has to suffer. These guys are so unapologetic that they donot even give the passengers any refreshment as a token of apology.

### "no provisions for transfer passengers"
I am writing to express my disappointment regarding my recent travel experience with Air India Express, specifically the poor handling of transfer passengers at Cochin International Airport. The first flight from Kolkata landed at Cochin at 17:40, and I was scheduled to depart for Sharjah at 02:40 the next morning, resulting in a 9-hour layover. While the flights were satisfactory, my experience during the layover at Cochin Airport was frustrating and inconvenient, particularly as it was my first time transiting through this airport. After arriving at Cochin, I moved from Terminal 1 (T1) to Terminal 3 (T3) for my onward flight. Upon reaching the departure entry gate, security informed me I could not enter because my flight was not until the next morning. By the time I arrived at 06:00 PM, I was told to wait outside until my flight’s schedule was displayed. Despite explaining I was tired, hungry, and my phone was low on battery, I was not allowed into the departure area and had to wait outside with no access to food, rest, or charging points. Cochin Airport has excellent facilities inside, but there were no provisions for transfer passengers with long layovers. I was left waiting for 4.5 hours outside without any seating, charging points, or food courts. There was no designated area for passengers like me, which added to the discomfort during this extended layover. As a transfer passenger, I believe it is the airline's responsibility to ensure passengers are well cared for during layovers. Air India Express did not provide adequate guidance or information regarding where to wait, the available facilities, or the process for accessing the departure gate. I was only allowed to enter the departure area after waiting outside for over 4.5 hours, which was distressing and avoidable. Airlines should provide a designated waiting area for passengers with long layovers, equipped with seating, charging points, food options, and a space for passengers to rest. Many international airports already offer such amenities, and their absence at Cochin was surprising. Clear communication is essential. Airlines should inform transfer passengers about where to wait, what facilities are available, and when they can access the departure gate. Security personnel should be well informed to allow transfer passengers into the departure area well before the flight. Increased Responsibility for Transfer Passengers: Air India Express must take more responsibility for the comfort and well-being of transfer passengers, particularly during long layovers. Passengers should not be left without food or charging facilities for extended periods, as this significantly impacts their travel experience. This experience would have been far worse if I had been traveling with family, especially children. Long layovers under these conditions would have been extremely challenging. I

### "charged extra for the seats"
Airport team charged extra for the seats saying i have not booked the seats. My questions is when i book a flight ticket technically am i not also booking a seat ?then why was i asked to pay extra for the seat. When i asked for a free seat it was denied and in hurry were made to pay for the seat. This is something against our will. No airlines charges extra unless it is preferred seat.

### “staff behaved very rudely”
My flight was scheduled for 15:45 from Mumbai to Jaipur and I reached the airport before 14:00 hours. I was waiting in the lounge and tracking the flight status, however, after some time the flight status showed as 16:05 hours. Even post 15:45 the flight status did not change, hence I went towards the boarding gate. However, as soon as I reached there I was curtly informed that the boarding was done and I cannot board the flight. Inspite of multiple requests, the staff behaved very rudely and did not let me board the flight inspite of the fact that the flight was still connected to the aerobridge. THE STAFF DID NOT EVEN CALL MY MOBILE TO INFORM ABOUT BOARDING BEING CLOSED. Over that the staff was least bothered about my flight being missed. Have not seen such pathetic behavior by any airline. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "staff is always unapologetic"
Garbage flight service of Air India express. My last 6 flights within a span of 4 months were delayed minimum by an hour for an hour flight. The staff is always unapologetic and Air India express never provide any kind of compensation in monetary value or meals.

### "lost my check in baggage"
Travelled from Sharjah to Amritsar and airline lost my check in baggage. Until now saying that you'll receive ASAP. Still no one knows where it is.

### “lack of politeness and professionalism”
Not Verified | I recently had a disappointing experience with Air India Express that I feel compelled to share. Unfortunately, my journey with them was far from pleasant, and I can't help but label it as one of the worst air services I've encountered. First and foremost, the staff's demeanor was less than welcoming. There was a noticeable lack of politeness and professionalism, which made the entire experience feel uncomfortable. Whether it was during check-in or on board the flight, the crew seemed disinterested and inattentive to passengers' needs. It’s disheartening to see that customer service is not a priority for them. To add to the frustration, my flight was delayed without any apology or communication from the staff. This lack of respect for passengers’ time was quite disappointing. Moreover, I witnessed them make a huge fuss over a mere 1 kg of excess baggage, which only added unnecessary stress to the situation. The way they handled it showed a distinct lack of respect for elders and made the experience even more uncomfortable. Additionally, the flight itself left much to be desired. The cabin was cramped, and the overall cleanliness was questionable. It's clear that the airline is cutting corners in ways that affect passenger comfort and satisfaction. In conclusion, my experience with Air India Express was underwhelming, characterized by poor service, a lack of empathy, and an uninviting atmosphere. I hope the airline takes serious steps to improve its customer service and overall flight experience, as I cannot recommend them based on my recent experience.

### "the most dreadful experience"
I had the most dreadful experience flying with Air India Express, and it was the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. From start to finish, everything went wrong. The boarding process was chaotic and disorganized. There was no clear communication, and I felt like I was being herded with no regard for passengers' comfort or convenience. When I finally boarded, the seat was uncomfortable and cramped. But the worst part was the staff and the overall hospitality. They were incredibly rude and seemed completely uninterested in helping passengers. Any time I asked a question or requested assistance, I was met with indifference. It was as if they couldn’t care less about providing any sort of service. Air India Express has set a new low for what I expect from an airline. Save yourself the frustration, and choose a different carrier. I will never be flying with them again.

### “appalled by the incompetence”
I'm appalled by the incompetence of Air India Express. My flight from Kochi to Bangalore was delayed by 3 hours without explanation or solution few hours before departure. This resulted in me having to reschedule my international flight and causing major inconvenience. The staff and customer service were unhelpful, offering no alternatives, compensation, or apologies. I incurred significant additional costs and stress. For peace of mind, I'd suggest avoiding this airline at any cost.

### "Cabin service was excellent"
Polite airport crew, appreciated behavior for boarding crew, flight journey was very smooth. Cabin service was excellent.

### "the food service were so slow"
The cabin crew doing the food service were so slow that for an hour to be really precise 7.30 to 8.20 they could only serve up to row 7 which was including maximum of pre booking meals. International flights especially should not be having such lame cabin crews who don’t understand the value of time and speed. Also on requesting them frequently to serve food they could just not do it until reminded for the second time. I don’t understand how did the two manage to clear the cabin crew assessments with this attitude. They were totally care free attitude giggling to the requests being made.

### "Staff not friendly at all"
Not Verified | 1. Landing experience was horrible. It felt like we are seated in a roller coaster ride. Flight cabins are not maintained (stains on the seats). 2. All flights are delayed and communication about the flight delay announcement happens just 2-3 hours before the journey. Further delay was not even announced. When asked, there was no proper response. Staff is not friendly at all.

### “experience and service was not expected”
Not Verified |  While flying from Bagdogra To Kolkata(CCU) at seat no 23C on Air India Express (Flight no:IX1952), one senior flight attendant named, Sweetmita shouted and misbehaved with me and my friends. This kind of experience and service was not expected from Air India Express, kindly please look into this matter for the future.

### "no customer service"
The airline has delayed the flight so that the connecting flight misses. Not provided any accomodation for the whole night. Stayed at airport from night 8:45 to morning 6:15. Told cab will take time to reach airport. Even after its an emergency has not booked the next Indigo flight. Worst airline with no customer service please do not travel.

### "impressed with ground staff"
Not Verified |  I'm very impressed with ground staff Ms Anshika at Lucknow airport. She was very courteous and helpful in our on boarding. Strong recommendations for her for going out of her way to help all passengers

### "customer service left much to be desired"
Not Verified | I had a disappointing experience with Air India Express on my recent journey from Calicut to Dubai. At Calicut International Airport, during check-in, the staff weighed my luggage and found it to be 1 kg over the limit due to my personal laptop. I understand that rules are rules, but I was surprised by their rigid approach. I requested leniency for just 1 kg, but they firmly insisted that I remove the excess weight. I explained that everything in my luggage was essential, yet they showed no flexibility or understanding. After reluctantly removing some items, they insisted on rechecking the luggage, adding to my frustration. This was very disheartening, especially since we had traveled after two years for a vacation. Given this unpleasant experience, I will no longer choose Air India Express for future travels and won’t recommend it to my family or friends. The customer service at the counter left much to be desired, and I hope they improve their approach toward travelers in similar situations.

### "Disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  Disappointing experience, worst service with no shame. No public concern as they delayed flight by at least 3 hours , the staff is standing chill at the counter. I asked them to adjust one kg in my check in luggage as I don’t have any cabin luggage, they refused bluntly. Useless, delayed and I suggest don’t look for this airline ever.

### "The worst experience"
The worst experience I have had with an airline. Doesn't serve hot beverages in a short duration flight. Changes the aircraft with prior notice when it wasn't supposed to change. Non cooperative staff at the airport to help ease the process for the passengers in case of any such changes mentioned above.

### "kindness and professionalism"
I recently traveled with Air India Express from Chennai to Hyderabad, and I had an incredible experience thanks to a kind woman named Nisha. I was on the verge of missing my flight, but Nisha went above and beyond to help me through the process quickly and efficiently. Her kindness and professionalism made all the difference in a stressful situation. I’m extremely grateful for her assistance and would like to commend her for providing such excellent service. Thank you, Air India Express, for having such wonderful staff.

### "had to fight for my rights"
How come this is the only airline who always have technical issue, delays and cancellations. Little I know I was gonna have terrible journey when I booked again the ticket with AIexpress. When I went at airport for checking in just they told aircraft is having technical and will be indefinitely delayed for 8hrs. So flight which was supposed to leave at 19:15 now rescheduled to 03:15. If they could have informed this prior we would have stayed at home. Now stuck at the airport with all persihbale food in the luggage we fought for the hotel booking. After all the chaos once we reach the hotel they said it should be 2 sharing room as per contract of the airline. Why would I spend night with a stranger. I had to fight for my rights. They dumped all the passengers with their luggage’s in a bus instead of providing seperate cabs to the airport and back to hotel. Ground service and management is terrible to the core. However inflight the crew was a relief.

### "charge two times for the extra baggage"
Worst experience ever, we travelled as family including 5 members and they charge two times for the extra baggage having less than 5 kg for the whole family and we paid more than the ticket price.

### "Worst flying experience"
Worst flying experience. Flight was delayed by six hours, in repeated increments, and boarding gates repeatedly changed, without any kind of announcement. Not a single mail or message was sent to my colleague who booked the flight for me, or to myself. Staff unqualified, unresponsive, and unenthusiastic. No food offered on board. Many seats broken. No coupons offered for the six extra hours I spent at the airport. No offer to move me to another flight. No compensation or apologies of any kind. Wasted a whole Sunday. This was my first and last flight on this appalling airline, which deserves a negative rating.

### "never fly this airline again"
The flight was delayed for hours, and I missed my international connecting flight because of that. I tried calling customer care after that, and there's no response even after calling their helpline number that says 24x7 availability. Worst journey ever. I will never fly this airline again. Can't believe it exists.

### "never ever fly Air India express"
Not Verified | There is a lite ticket which allows only cabin baggage and not checking baggage. That check-in baggage is not allowed in lite category ticket was not explicitly mentioned. This was a big hit for me as I discovered I had to pay 1500 for a 3 kg pack for check-in. What kind of a rule is this? Will never ever fly Air India express. It should be named Air India unreserved passenger and not express

### "inflight service was not that great"
It was my first time travelling on Air india express and it was great. When I got stuck at Emigration one staff came and helped me by giving his phone to call my family because my phone was dead. The inflight service was not that great. The Air hostess have too much attitude. Most of the time they were just chit chatting with each other not attending properly to the people in need.

### "my usual choice of travel"
Air India Express is my usual choice of travel by flight and I am happy with their service and flight timings. Would like to make special mention of my check in today which was very smooth and efficient. The staff at the counter checked us in with a very professional and efficient manner, and a friendly approach. The process did not take very long and before we knew it we were on our way . It is because of such service that Air India Express stands out from the rest of the airlines and I prefer Air India Express whenever the need for travel by air arises.

### "disappointing experience"
Not Verified |   I had a frustrating experience with Air India Express during my recent flight. Despite having 8 kg less than the allowed weight for my checked baggage, they wouldn’t let me take an extra 1 kg in my cabin baggage. When I arrived at the airport, I made sure to comply with all the baggage policies. However, at the check-in counter, the staff insisted that I adhere strictly to the cabin baggage limit, even though my checked baggage was well under the weight limit. I tried explaining that I wasn’t exceeding the overall allowance, but they were inflexible and didn’t seem to care about the context. In the end, I had to leave some of my belongings behind, which was incredibly inconvenient and stressful. It felt unfair and inconsistent with their overall baggage policy. It was a disappointing experience that left me questioning whether I’d choose Air India Express again in the future.

### "max with 10kg including my laptop"
I have hand / cabin luggage of 8kg and my laptop. when the ground staff verify the weight the combined weight is came around 12kg. the ground staff advised me, that i will be allowed to fly max with 10kg including my laptop. i advised i never had an experience in any of my air travel that the laptop is being weighted. i had removed some stuff from baggage and bring it to 7kg and after adding my laptop its became 11kg. the ground still not allowing me to drop the baggage and advising me to reduce 1 more kg. finally i end up in leaving my hand trolly bag in airport and took all my stuff in the reusable bag.

### "will never fly with you again"
I recently flew with Air India Express, and I have to say, it was an absolutely horrible experience. My luggage check-in time was 4:50 AM, and due to unexpected traffic caused by construction, I arrived at 5:01 AM. Instead of offering any help, the agent at the counter simply denied me boarding and acted like I was an inconvenience. I usually leave my home two hours early to avoid any issues, but this day was different, and I was not the only passenger affected. Rather than showing any empathy, she spent her time on her phone, completely ignoring us. After begging for about 15-20 minutes, she finally called her supervisor, only to demand an extra 4,000 rupees to board with my luggage, claiming I was late. Meanwhile, another passenger with no luggage was also charged 4,000 because he hadn’t done web check-in. It was absurd. On the return leg, I faced another issue with a connecting flight. My flight was late, and all I got was a 5 rupee water bottle for my trouble. I arrived in Bangalore at 12:45 PM, with a connecting flight at 1 PM. Somehow, the flight was fine waiting for some passengers but couldn’t show the same courtesy to me when I was late. It’s not just about the money; it’s about the complete lack of professionalism and respect from the staff. If you want to charge extra for being late, just ask. But ignoring passengers while you’re glued to your phone? I am extremely disappointed and will never fly with you again.

### Air India Express customer review
It was awful to travel with this flight. They surprised me in the check in area, after one and half hours standing in the line I got to the counter for boarding pass but they were telling me that there was a payment, payment for what reason? They said seat selection, i was go through the web check in but i dont confirm or select any seat. I explain to them but they insisted to pay. At last i pay 55 SAR instead of 25 SAR, 30 SAR tax they said). Totally disappointed travel.

### “such exceptional service”
Review for Ms. Sandra, Air India Express Counter Staff – Madurai Airport I had the pleasure of interacting with Ms. Sandra at the Air India Express counter during my departure from Madurai to Singapore on 30th September 2024. Her professionalism and friendly demeanor left a lasting impression on me. She was incredibly helpful, honest, and approachable, all while maintaining a warm smile throughout the process. Her prompt assistance made the entire check-in process smooth and stress-free, and it was evident that she genuinely cared about providing excellent service to passengers. Ms. Sandra’s positive attitude and dedication truly enhanced my travel experience. I am grateful for her efforts and would like to commend her for her outstanding service. Thank you, Ms. Sandra, for making my departure from Madurai a pleasant one. I look forward to experiencing such exceptional service again in the future. I appreciate TaTa’ Air India Express for recruiting and employing such exceptional people.

### "The worst possible experience"
The worst possible experience. I reserved this flight, and I arrived an hour before takeoff. However, a few self-drop baggage machines were not working due to hurriedness, wasting valuable time. As a result, at approximately 10:20, they stopped accepting our bags and told us that the allotted time had passed. The staff members were also extremely unprofessional and unresponsive, not prepared to assist. They moreover they asked us to cancel the ticket and this is not happened with us only other passengers also faced the same issue. Not at acceptable our money and time is wasted

### "I feel it's more worst now"
First of all, the boarding at Bahrain airport was delayed by 1 hour without any information. Secondly there is no inflight entertainment services. Then comes the service in the flight which is the worst, what I had ordered along with my ticket was not available and the crew came to me and told me she will be back in 5 mins and she did not turn up for next 30 mins, later she came with an alternative and gave me and I had not even finished my food and the lights in the cabin was turned off. Then I arrived at New Delhi airport and the check in process was so complicated the crew dud not know which counter is for domestic or international they made me roam around 4 times from one counter to other later, I had to raise my voice to get my check in done. Was expecting the airlines to do better after TATA taking over but I feel it's more worst now.

### “Very bad service”
Not Verified | Very bad service. No accurate timing. Delaying without any communication. Staffs  do not seem experienced and not sure about the process. First and last time booking this service. Advise everyone not to book because your time is more valuable than money.

### "no information provided"
Not Verified |  The flight delayed for 2 hrs and no information provided by airline. This will be my last trip with Air India Express, the worst airline

### "they refused to refund"
I was travelling with family for return journey on 20th July for onward travel and booked Xpress value fare with additional baggage purchased in advance for excess. At the airport check in counter, they said no allowance for checked in baggage and handed me a invoice of INR seventeen thousand three hundred which I had to pay to board the flight. When I queried later about this excess charged, their customer service however confirmed 30 kg allowance for two extra piece of baggage which I had already purchased before travel and free 45 kg of baggage allowance. When I asked for refund they refused to refund saying ticket fare does not allow baggage allowance. When I asked about the difference in payment and calculation for the excess baggage at the rate per kg, they said this is additional charge, remained unexplained what is for. When I asked about the discount rate for excess not available online, they said ticket booked don't have this option. When I asked about excess kg calculation, they said contents are not paid for the extra pieces of baggage I purchased.

### “Employees behave badly”
Not Verified | Employees behave badly and with a great deal of arrogance and their new website is appalling. It functions correctly the first time you book. However, it will initiate their fraudulent activities when we attempt to manage the ticket choice and alter the ticket date. TATA (tcs) is genuinely defrauding its clients if they are unable to operate a website correctly. The level of customer service is appalling. Their servers are consistently unavailable when we contact for assistance. My family and I traveled frequently. However, I've since made the decision to never use Air India Express for travel again. Our money and time are precious. Spend a little bit more on other airlines and have a stress-free journey.

### "Worst flight experience"
Not Verified |   Worst flight experience with Air India express. Non cooperative staff. Lazy ground staff. Less knowledgeable staff in terms of infant rules. I travelled with my infant, .experienced a lot of problems and no help from the staff. My experience with other flights like indigo and spicejet while carrying an infant was much better. I will try my best no to book Air India express again.

### “no commitment to the clients”
Not Verified | Please don’t book with this company. Very bad service; no commitment to the clients. Just casually telling flight is overbooked after multiple rescheduling, and acting like a victim and making the client the culprit. Very pathetic. Wish there were more good services like Jet Airways, Emirates, Fly Dubai, or Air Arabia to the Malabar region. Very pathetic, only showing their attitude in threatening passengers who are helpless to reach on an emergency basis and giving silly reasons. I want to complain about staff in Dubai airport, no professionalism and talking in a regional language. At least give a strict order to your international staff to talk in English. The staff don’t care about the client. Their attitude is arrogant and rude; they know nothing will happen. They know people will book again and they can cancel any flight and loot their money without any shame. Airport authorities should take action against this.

### "Worst flight experience"
Worst flight experience. 1.5 hour delay. No proper reason. No communication with the passengers. We were sitting in the flight for 1.5 hours. All Air India flights have been the same in the past.

### "Frequently flight delays"
Worst management of an airline ever. Frequently flight delays and Cancellation. No clearance of staff in any grievances. Keeps customer in dark. How can an airline have simultaneously several days of delays and cancellation. Better not to book in this airline ever.

### “I was really disappointed”
Not Verified | I have travelled almost more than 25 times on Air India Express flights, Air India flight staff don't know how to treat the customer. There was not any snacks, I was really disappointed, but unfortunately we don't have other options for who to travel to Mangalore, this is our bad luck.

### “Worst flight experience”
Worst flight experience ever. Right from check in to in flight services. I was travelling with an infant for the first time and the cabin crew was least bothered to give me any safety instructions or assistance and were behaving rudely with other passengers as well.

### “What a shame!”
The crew did not bother to come when the crew support button was pressed for almost an hour. I was forced to choose veg meal instead of non veg as they ran out of it earlier on. I refused the meal. On landing in Kochi on 1st itself my baggage lock was broken and my clothes were dirty. This is the first time a lock was broken and the ground staff was not willing to raise a complaint, just asked me to email their support on the issue. The only consolation was that the pilot landed the plane was minutes earlier even though we took off 10 mins late. This is not just poor services but a sad situation for our countries airliner. What a shame!

### "huge amount on the extra bag"
Not Verified |   The worst airline as it is charging huge amount on the extra bag I travel from Hyderabad to Delhi by vistara with the same baggage they didn’t charge me any amount, but when I try to onboard from Delhi to Srinagar by air India express they charged me 1k rs extra and the time they have taken extra 30min from delhi to Srinagar.

### "told to check in our cabin baggage"
I have never been asked to weigh a laptop bag which has only laptop & accessories and asked to pay 1.5 times of the ticket price. As per the rules I made sure that I was within the baggage allowance at least 5 times before coming to the airport. The ground staff was very rude from the beginning, called us by tapping the table asking us to weight all our bags, 3 times in her counter & 2 times in the next counter & even all the weight was within range, demanded us to weigh the leather laptop bag & calculated a whopping amount of Rs. 9000 & upon frustration I thrown out my Rs. 4000 worth of goods in the counter. Later we were told to check in our cabin baggage as well. Worst than this, I have paid for priority seating, but no cabin space was available & was told to put the bags under my seat after multiple request to various staffs since they were ignoring us. Realised they don’t have 1:1 cabin space & hence they are cheating passengers so that ground staff will be able to check in your cabin baggage with extra money. If they don’t have space they should clearly state that only shoulder bags are allowed in cabin. We even flew from SIN to MAA in the same airline & before boarding the plane was told to give the luggage to be checked in since the cabin doesn’t have the space last minute. We even flew with less than 10kg for a 40 kg check-in allowance. Will never ever travel not even dare to compare ticket price in future. Not worth it

### "Very worst service"
Very worst service, flight delayed 4hrs, counter employees not treating like customer. Air India only allowing 20 kg per person, other airways 30kg per person. They did not provide the blankets to the kids even after we request.

### "appreciate his professionalism"
London Heathrow to Ranchi via Mumbai on 29th March at 6.05am, Kaustubh at the booking desk was immensely helpful. I appreciate his professionalism and keenness to help and resolve our concerns. This made our journey comfortable and enjoyable. I will also like to thank the entire crew that flew us to Ranchi. Amazing airline and staff with good food.

### "Worst staff service"
Not Verified |  I went for boarding passes and I ask for front row because of my daughter. First told me they can provide me only one seat that time, they don’t told me about the charges of the seat. Another staff named came and told me to pay for that seat but when I am travelling from Kolkata to Bangalore only 2 days ago in the same airline they have not charged for the front row Why the rules are different in same airline. Worst staff service, its better to fly in Indigo

### "feeling trapped in the flight"
The flight journey began at 5:50 am, the estimated time has been 2 hours, now as I’m writing this review with the time 10:00am and not yet reached the destination. I agree on the airline not having control over the weather and landing to the nearest airport, but to consider, the passengers have been sitting in the capsule for almost 4 hours feeling trapped in the flight to get instructed by the captain to sit and wait a while before confirmation about the status of weather at the destination. I request airline authorities to come up with a drill to instruct the passengers in regards of few body movements for blood circulation at these moments of delayed flights or long hours of waiting inside the capsule. The drill can be trained to an emphatic hostess, so she could instruct the passengers at times of malfunction or delay in timelines from the airline.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. The crew is so irresponsible. Also the flight was cancelled due to bad weather but i got no refund. Its been 15 days since my flight has been cancelled and i haven't received my refund and its also showing that the flight was not cancelled when they cancelled it right in front of me. Never going to fly in Air India express ever.

### "Worst crew I've ever flown with"
Not Verified |  Worst crew I've ever flown with. Asked for a glass of water from a cabin crew as she was walking by when we landed in Guwahati. Gave me the side eye without even stopping and gave a slight nod rudely. Never got the water. I don't think it's commonplace nowadays for the crew to be this conceited. Felt like I was asking for a huge favour

### "flight experience was worst"
Not Verified |  The flight experience was worst. They charge exorbitant price even for an extra luggage. The flight got delayed and they did not inform us. It was at later stage, when we were informed about the delay. Would never recommend taking Air India Express

### "No proper communication"
We flew from TVM to BLR via Indigo and reached at 8:30 am. Our next flight was via air India express from Bangalore to Varanasi which was schedule for 12:35. The flight was delayed multiple times and at Bangalore airport not a single staff to provide us with update on what’s happening. No proper communication and update it’s unbelievable how they are managing the airline.

### "never recommend Air India"
Worst flight experience, the flight was delayed for 3 times, by 6 hours. My entire day and other plans got cancelled because of the flight negligence. I will never recommend Air India to anyone

### "Thanks for their support"
I booked ticket on emergency and due to heavy traffic on road I reached late to the boarding station, but the staff helped me in making of boarding pass. Thanks for their support

### "did not enjoy my flight"
Not Verified |   Flight was late in taking off by 15 minutes therefore landing was also delayed by 25 minutes. Seats are very close to each other, feels very congested and claustrophobic as leg space is bare minimum. Although food quality is good but the service by the inflight crew is poor, I had a complementary meal booked and the crew staff was shouting my name 3 rows behind and was not ready to check the seat number of the booked meal, and upon telling that the name she is shouting is mine, I was frowned upon. Upon clearance of waste, they barely stopped for even a second at every row and were in a hurry to rush things when it was a clearly more than 3 hours flight. Once again reiterating the delay in flight as it does not sit very easily with me. All in all did not enjoy my flight with Air India Express, definitely is not at par with its contemporaries.

### "never travel again in this airline"
Not Verified |  Worst service! Even after reaching airport on time could not board the flight. 4 other passengers faced the same issue. Waste of money and more importantly time. I tried to raise a support ticket immediately to ask for refund, but that’s is an automated chat bot. Horrible! Will never travel again in this airline.

### "the worst experience"
During August I have booked my flight ticket from COK TO SHJ which was supposed to be on 5th November. And today 25th of October I received an email confirmation that my trip was rescheduled to Dec 2nd. How can I accept this one month delay? This is the worst experience from a flight carrier. I will never book this for my future trips.

### "It is a worst service"
Air India Express flight scheduled on 6th at 19 15H. From Cochin to Sharjah till now (7th) Air India Express not ready to fly. All passengers really fed up. All are in the airport around more than 16 hours (night and morning). Air India Express are not doing anything for passengers. It is a worst service.

### "One of the worst airline services"
Not Verified |  One of the worst airline services they have. They didn't board any luggage on plane, such a reckless carelessness. I have my wedding today and all my stuff is in my luggage, I have to repurchase my clothes because of Air India. I’ll never travel or recommend others to fly Air India. They informed me they will deliver my baggage today early morning but then again when I contacted the customer care they are saying by evening no sense of responsibility and worst time management.

### "canceled the flight without any information"
Worst experience I have ever faced. Worst airline. No communication at all. I reach airport and they canceled the flight without any information and staff at office are utter useless. I got a confirmation mail from airline but the staff at Chennai airport were saying no flight on Wednesday and laughed.

### "not a pleasant or comfortable experience"
I was travelling with my family on 21 August 2023 with my family. We were 8 people in total and was carrying 4 hand carry in total. The staff was not giving a pleasant or comfortable experience while checking in. He made us wait for at least 45 minutes in the counter by saying least sensible issues by changing small weights to other bags due to minor weight variations. I never had any experience like this that too when a reputed company like TATA took over the company and people like me expecting great services from you. I hope the concerned people will talk to him and make him understand how to really treat the customers when flying with you. My family strongly said never to fly with Air India or Air India Express due to this experience despite being your loyal customer.

### "charge you for every 1 Kg"
Ticket rate was cheap but if you have baggage more than 27 KG including your handbag backpack they will charge you for every 1 Kg, they will not consider even 1 KG or half KG. They will urge you to pay immediately. Even books are not allowed in hand. Hate Air India Express.

### "utter wastage of money and time"
Amritsar to Dubai flight on 12th August - the pilot announced mid-air that we are landing at Sharjah. It took him 10 minutes to realise and reannounce and correct himself (that we are landing in Dubai) without any apologies while passengers panicked. The plane also had impactful landing and at very high speed which made passengers to grab their seats/handles, even if there was no weather issue. Horrible flight, angry, rude, untrained/zero manners crew, zero management - utter wastage of money and time!

### "Cabin crews were friendly"
Not Verified |  Cabin crews were friendly. Food of upuma and masala tea was fine with us for breakfast. No delay in flight. Flight return to Singapore 20 minutes early. Announcement was clear.

### "they broke my new luggage"
Worst flight experience ever. I flew few days ago and they broke my new luggage bag handle. Easily we can understand that happen due to miss handling or brute force. I reported them then they replied to me like this happen only due to Wear and tear, Customer must pack properly, etc. I don't understand how we can cover our handle and if we cover what's the use of luggage handle. Also, what do they mean about wear and tear for new product. Now they made it like it can't be used anymore.

### "delayed by more than 3 hours"
Very bad experience with Air india Express. My flight from Doha to Cochin was scheduled for 22.20 but ended up being delayed by more than 3 hours, causing significant inconvenience and frustration. The delay not only disrupted my travel plans but also resulted in additional expenses. I had made arrangements based on the original arrival time, which had to be hastily adjusted due to the unforeseen delay. This situation has caused a great deal of inconvenience, stress, and financial burden. The airline should have offered compensation but was not given. I have always relied on Air India Express for my travel needs, but this had made me a huge loss since I had another flight.

### "a budget flight but with a high fare"
Not Verified |  Mostly prices are high even in non-peak times, I planned to travel May 2023 but the price was more than 1000 AED for a one-way flight from DXB-SHJ to TRZ. This is a budget flight but with a high fare.

### "don't recommend this airline"
I would like to express my bad experience while traveling in Air India Express flight from Dubai to Trivandrum. The flight was delay by 11 hrs and not informed to the passengers on time. Very rude behavior of ground staff during hand baggage weighing. The guy who is taking fine from the passengers who is carrying extra baggage is treating the other passengers like criminals. In the flight i asked a bottle of water for my wife and waited for 15 min and just to use toilet i need to wait a lot because of the disfunctioning. This airline is not good for travelling and don't recommend this airline to anyone.

### "accommodative and hospitable"
The air crew members of Flight 1X 442 Muscat to Cochin on 29.4.23 were accommodative and hospitable. Kudos to the air crew team. Especially the airhostess was very sweet in terms of remediating a seat error which had occurred at the front desk while issuing the boarding pass, and she went the extra mile by even ensuring that the restroom was good enough to be used after another passenger had used. Food was hygienically prepared and packed, and services were professional.

### "Very good healthy food"
Excellent Service. Always on time. Good seat quality and leg space. Best cabin crew in response, service. Very good healthy food. Good luggage handling. Excellent take off and landing. Very good check-in assistance and best service.

### "entire staff are rude"
I boarded the flight from New Delhi to Sharjah on 18.01.2023. It was the worst experience I ever had. Not only the flight is poor but the entire staff are rude, unprofessional and uneducated. I think this is the reason they offer low cost flight and save money by hiring unprofessional employees. I believe they are trained for misbehaving with the passenger. Food was served in a manner as if they are doing some favour. I will never board Air India Express flight again and will prefer to spend more money on some good company.

### "poor service"
Not Verified |  Flight delayed more than 24 hours. The express doesn't have any back plan or they don't have any commitments to passengers. Overall poor service.

### "delayed for 24 hours and no prior information"
The flight was delayed for 24 hours and no prior information was passed to the passengers. All the passengers arrived at the airport checked in and had to wait for 6 hours before some came along with police to inform that the flight has some technical fault and they don't know when it will be fixed. Ultimately had to wait for 24 hours. No arrangements for food or water was made.

### "Not value for money"
Doha to Trivandrum. Not value for money. Seats very congested, very poor boarding. Always getting delayed, find insects in seat area. The toilet not at all clean. Snack provided is not good.

### "This airline is not worth the money"
Very worst experience with this budget airline. Hope the term budget is just used for marketing purpose, but actual cost to fly with Air India express is more than luxury airlines. I've been stopped for 1KG extra luggage, even though i had very less cabin luggage weight. Very worst sanitary management inside the plane. Crew are very intelligent & keeping a toilet separately for them by simply locking it from outside. None of the crew follow basic covid-19 protocol, no one wears mask. 2 triangle shaped (half of bread) with very salty cheese & local made sweet bun, approx.100ml/200ml water served. Leg room is very worst. This airline is not worth the money.

### "It is value for money"
Did not expect such a punctuality and great customer service. Blue leather cover seats, clean washroom. Onboard  services was limited but complimentary meal was served. It is value for money.

### "horrible customer service"
I have heard about the horrible customer service of Air India Express before but have never experienced it until recently. I was flying on Air India Express from Doha to Cochin on Feb 24, 2022. At the check in counter at Hamad International Airport, I encountered the most rude staff ever. On showing my full vaccination certificate (Covishield from India with QR code), they claimed this is not the right certificate, since it only showed the date of second dose, not the first dose. (Isn't it obvious I have taken the first dose if second dose is valid?) Also, in my certificate printout, our PM Modi's picture was not printed clearly and they raised an issue stating 'where is Modi's picture? This is not authentic'. Does the airline really validate vaccination certificates based on Modi's photo rather than the valid QR code right next to it? When I tried to explain that I travelled to Doha 2 months earlier with the same certificate and had no issue, the staff told me not to argue and would not even bother listening to me. He demanded I show him the date of first dose or I cannot board the flight. Luckily, I had my laptop with me and I could access the first dose certificate in a couple of minutes. But the basis on how Air India Express staff check vaccination certificates and the way they speak to their customers is absolutely pathetic and inhumane. The staff need to be taught how to speak to humans with basic decency!

### "Such a pathetic service"
Not Verified | Such a pathetic service by Air India Express. Call center is useless, agents are unprofessional with lack of knowledge. I booked flight for 17th Dec, 11:15 PM and received a message on 15th Dec at 8:00 PM that flight is rescheduled at 02:30 Hrs without mentioning date. When I called call center they informed that flight has been postponed by a day and on 16th night I have to report to airport with pcr results. It’s so unprofessional from airline and above that they informed they can’t do anything and I have to do pcr in that limited time and get the results. Will never travel by this airline any more.

### "What a pathetic airline"
Not Verified |  What a pathetic airline. The flight is delayed and yet, they are checking in passengers, not even informing them about the delay. I mean who does that? How can you not update your passengers regarding the flight status? That's the bare minimum you need to do. Secondly, what sort of a money-making business are you in? Can't provide a wheelchair for free to an elderly passenger who really needs it? This is seriously shoddy stuff. Paying AED 110 for wheelchair assistance? I am writing this review in plain disgust. Never flying again with you.

### "I have not received refund yet"
I booked this flight for my parents. But due to unknown reasons, Air India Express cancelled flight just before boarding. Nobody gave any answers regarding that. Even Airport personnel were not helpful. Because of this I had to cancel the return flight and I have not received refund yet.

### "This was very disappointing"
This was very disappointing that we had a flight on 11th November 2021 at 21.00 hours from Goa to Mumbai and we reached airport 2 hours before as per the terms. I got a message at 7.18 pm that the flight has been postponed to 22.35 so when we approach the Air India check-in desk we came to know that the flight had some technical errors and the aircraft is in Mumbai and some spare parts need to come from Delhi. Because of this the staff were not able to tell us if the flight could be boarded or may be canceled and they committed for the full refund so we processed the refund and booked tickets with Indigo for 2.20 am on 12 th and we have to wait at the airport no less than 8 hours because of miss communication or later communication with us. Air India have not shown any courtesy to reschedule our flight with very immediate or next day flight as they are claiming all upcoming flights to Mumbai today and tomorrow morning is full. My advise to every one, don’t choose Air India alliance airlines for your travels, otherwise you will be stuck at the airport.

### "crew surprisingly good"
Trivandrum to Abu Dhabi. I am a doctor booked the ticket one week prior to my journey online. Only requirement mentioned in the ticket was check in before 3 hours. I telephoned the customer care several times on the day before the journey, busy all the time and if we get a ring the no one picks it up, wasted almost one hour in vain. On the day I had suffered like anything at the check in. Mental stress was huge. Air India staff behavior were not pleasing at all at the airport. But on board crew the on that day were surprisingly good. My experience at Abu Dhabi airport was extremely good that prompted me to write a review regarding the customer care Air India Express.

### "A very unhappy customer"
Intention of budget airline was to support poor passengers, however the famous #airindiaexpress now looting their covid impacted travellers in all means and providing the worst service in the industry. Some highlights of the customer support: Cancellation charges applied for all cancelled flights at least 4500/- UAE/India sector, whereas private operators reimbursing full amount a couple of days after cancellation of flights. Rescheduling or refund request (even after deduction) not possible online, still in bullock-cart era, they claim that it is a government company unlike private agencies, they have rules to comply. Customers to call and wait for hours on unanswered call center lines for rescheduling. If you are lucky enough and get through, then after the interrogation, they will send a link where you have to pay the difference in charge, then after the payment again you have to call for rescheduling. Emails are not responded / all requests for refunds through emails are ignored. A very unhappy customer of #Airindiaexpress.

### "really upset about your service"
How long will it take for the refund? If there are a large number of transactions and numerous refunds are pending it's not customers fault. You must plan to clear the same. Worst service I never experienced. Its been 4 month since I made this ticket cancellation. If you can't refund this amount back to customers, why did you made changes in flight schedules. Earlier your customer care agent told me that the amount will be credited in 14 working days. But till now the cash is not credited in my account. I'm really upset about your service. If you cant provide /manage services close all your services.

### "I did not get a refund yet"
Its been 5 months and I did not get a refund yet. My flight got canceled in January this year. I tried to contact Goibibi they said Airline not provided a refund yet once the airline gives then they can process it. I wasted my lot of time contacting Airline customer service,  many time hang up. I'll never deal with Air India again, worst experience after-sales.

### "made me very comfortable"
My seat was in the front row, flying for the first time I was nervous, but the crew made me very comfortable. They served snacks, snacks wasn't great though. And to my surprise a cabin crew came seeing my nervous face and was comforting me they gave to the meal. I will travel with this low cost carrier of India .

### "until now I have no response"
My baggage was damaged while I was traveling from Dubai to Mumbai on the 18th Dec. I reported the incident at the Baggage counter and I was given a baggage report stating that I will be contacted within 48HRS for the repair or replacement whichever possible. Until two weeks there was no call, all the numbers mentioned on the Receipt given me were not working or Disconnected. Then after almost two weeks someone from Vilson Enterprises (Authorised Bag Repair Centre) visited and took the bag stating he will see if it is possible to repair the bag and will send a report to Air India. It's been almost a month and until now I have no response, I have been trying to reach the concern department but the numbers at still Not in service.

### "Very poor customer service"
I have travelled in this flight dated on 28-10-2020 from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi via Lucknow. I haven't received my baggage in Delhi Airport and the team very simply states that your baggage may dropped at Lucknow. Today 30-10-2020 they are again saying that your baggage is in Lucknow and will receive upon confirmation by other team, and in next flight schedule from Lucknow to Delhi. Actually my final destination is Chennai. Because of air india express I already INR 4000 paid to indigo for express baggage and my goods will get expire. Also I don't have clothes to wear, purchasing new for survival is additional cost. And if my baggage is delivered to Chennai, to collect it I have to travel 250kms. Again travelling to collect baggage is additional expense. Overall I am losing more than the ticket amount that I have paid to Air India Express. Very poor customer service, they are very careless team. No proper response for the customer queries and simply disconnecting the call.

### "took off and landed on time"
Bikaner to New Delhi. Ticket bought in the morning of the flight as the province was locking down that evening. Check in was fast and efficient. There were no problems with my checked bag being slight overweight. The flight took off and landed on time. The plane was turboprop and looked fairly new. Seating was 2x2 and there was adequate room. Minimal cold refreshments were served on the flight. As expected there was no IFE. In New Delhi the bag came off quickly.

### "I expect to be compensated"
I had 4 of my family members booked with Air India Express to travel from Chennai to Singapore on 13th of Feb on flight IX688. They were travelling from mumbai to Chennai for the flight. On reaching Chennai airport at 2.30am on the 13th they were told that the flight is delayed by 5 hours. They had a connecting flight to catch from Singapore to Perth. On mentioning this the airline just said that "we can’t help you , you will have to buy a new ticket from Singapore". There was no communication sent to the travelers regarding the delay as well. As a result I had to buy 4 new tickets from Chennai to Perth with Malindo. I expect to be compensated with this amount.

### "Excellent Service"
Doha to Mumbai. Excellent Service. Always on timw. Good seat quality and leg space. Best cabin crew in response, service. Very good healthy food. Good laugage handling. Excellent take off and landing. Very good check-in assistance.

### "refund system is very bad"
Sharjah to Cochin. My review is not against flight services, its about finance team. Their refund system is very bad, I have been sending emails for refund since 2 month, and customer service is responding to emails. Unfortunately finance department never replied. I did not receive any single rupee as refund yet.

### "no single entertainment"
I traveled with my son on 9th from Mangalore to Dubai and there is no single entertainment in the flight, morning 9 am flight departure at 5.20 at evening. In flight entertainment required and also need to increase the luggage from 20 kg to 30 kg.

### "a pleasant flight"
Not Verified |  Cochin to Abu Dhabi was a pleasant flight with smiling crew. Snack box provided with water. Now started to sell alcoholic drinks. Being o time is a plus for this flight. Before years back the aircraft had many common video screens. But nothing now. I suggest to available this facility.

### "Worst experience I ever had"
Not Verified |  Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram. Flight delay for 3 hour 30 mins. No A/c in flight for 2 hours, everyone started using magazine for air. Food was worst and gave only snacks (When someone paying 2000AED just to get snacks in flight. No soft drinks or juices gave. N0 Blanket give to the customers. Worst experience I ever had.

### "no one cares to reply"
I booked my return ticket from Dubai to Delhi and at the time of booking the attendant mentioned that i can cancel the ticket within one week. But when I cancelled my ticket I got a confirmation for cancellation but my refund did not come back until 20 days. I called several times to customer care but no one cares to reply via email or anything.

### "plain and simple incompetence and laziness"
This is the worst experience ever endured by me in aviation. The flight has been delayed for more than an hour and a half because of the system crash at the airport which is not Air India's fault but the way they have handled the situation is the ridiculous. None of the flight attendants answered any of the call bells or any of the questions which the passengers have. The Capt made one PA which wasn't followed by any updates. The PA said it would be a delay of 10-15 mins and now it's over an hour and half. Finally caught a flight attendant to inform them about my connection flight to which his response was that the ground staff would deal with it, worst part is that I would be stuck at the airport because of their incompetence for more than 12 hrs which is unacceptable. I don't understand how the printing of load sheet manually takes this long as I fly a 380 aircraft and have had incidents of system crashing and have never taken this long. This is plain and simple incompetence and laziness on their part and nothing else. They are not professional at all and no wonder they would not be surviving for too long. The crew have been nothing but lazy and rude. And no information has been given to us about the status of the departure. When asked a crew about the flying time, they replied I don't know which honestly baffles me.

### "staff service was good"
Delhi to Dubai. Seats were comfortable and had good leg space. The air conditioning and cabin lights were good. The staff service was good. The food provided was a snacks box, but for the price we booked. its justified. Flight took off late by 50 minutes that was a disappointment.

### "mostly like a horror movie"
Doha to Kolkata via Mumbai. Air India wasn't my first choice of airline. Usually, when looking for airlines to fly, I'm searching up and down the list of consumer-aviation from Qatar. This trip was mostly like a horror movie. The start - flight was precisely 1 hour late on 11th Jan 19 (AI9002). Was quite patient with the waiting time. Then it all started. Here’s the list of flaws: Poor hygiene in the washroom. No head napkin/hygiene cloth on top of the seat (absolutely unacceptable. Dinner - a nightmare and I must elaborate with complete respect by saying management is least bothered with regards to the quality of food, no expiry date label on the food (how could you do that. It’s simply criminal). Asked the staff and all that they have to say is “It’s our standard”. I replied “ It’s my right to know the manufacturing date and the date of expiration”. Eyebrows up and rolling eyes is all I got. Staff looked helpless as they had no answer and hid themselves behind the curtain and never came out to clarify further. It’s my right to have a great experience leave beside the money paid for the ticket. I do not expect a Qatar Airways service but at least please try and get close to them to make all happy who chooses you. Take customers seriously please. On the contrary the flight from Mumbai to Kolkata was excellent. Professional staff. Good breakfast (again label missing). Honestly this flight made some good service recovery.

### "the flight is a disgrace"
Dubai to Mumbai in Air India Express flight no. IX-248. The flight is a disgrace and most unpresentable flight I have ever flown with. Seating was very uncomfortable and the seats were completely worn out. The seats were not having the adequate cushioning as well since they had worn out and led to back ache. The flight condition was also not as per the standard and the floor was having marks of liquid spilled or vomit. I have usually observed that the flights bound to India are not up to the mark and will not be as per expectations, as compared to flights bound for US or London. However, this time has been worst.

### "a great experience"
Dubai to Kochi return. I had a great experience. Both these days the service rendered by the cabin crew. Air India express should improve there seats and also  include some variety in the foods which are serving to guest. And also take care about the time management.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Sharjah to Chandigarh. I was worried that the flight will be awful, dirty seats, constant delays. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Seats were clean Flight was delayed with communication in time. No further delays were done. Flight food was good and refills given (surprisingly), without a frown on face. No checks on hand luggage weight was done repeatedly. I did make sure, I was under limits. Only constructive feedback, I can give is door lock for the toilets was not working.

### "asked my seating preference"
Kozhikode to Dubai. This is the first time a boarding card issuing person asked my seating preference. And i am very very happy to hear that. I didn't note her name, but a big thank from my heart. I wish everyone does the same to all passenger whether single or with family.

### "I don't care way of dealing"
Dubai to Lucknow. An I don't care way of dealing with customers. The airline doesn't only charge the fare, but also everything you may ever need like water etc. Excess baggage is counted with duty free shopping.

### "staff with adamant nature"
Not Verified |  Dubai to Pune. Worst experience especially with ground staff with adamant nature. Cabin baggage were getting weighed at boarding point just few minutes before boarding. Even though more than half flight was empty, passengers were forced to pay 1 kg or 2 kg extra luggage. Whoever resisted were threatened by ground staff to off board. There is no control measures taken at Boarding pass issuing point by airlines as I was having enough scope to transfer my luggage in to check in baggage & passengers are literally black mailed at last moment i.e. few minutes before boarding time, where there's no scope left for passenger to decide.

### "Overall experience was good"
Delhi to Dubai. Before my journey I got to know about a lots of negative reviews about the airline. But after travelling thru this airline personally it is not bad, food was good, staff was helping, aircraft from Delhi to Dubai was little bad but aircraft on return was good. Overall experience was good.

### "flights are delayed"
Chennai to Trivandrum. Many Air India Express flights are delayed by more than 1 hour and today the same happened. This is frustrating 2hr delay in boarding flight and again 30 minutes delay in getting check in baggage. Please improve your service and value customers time.

### "first experience is bad"
This is the first time I am travelling from Air India Express from Dubai to New Delhi and my first experience is bad. Firstly the flight is delayed by 2 hrs. All the crew members are talking to the passengers in Hindi. Even though my mother tongue is hindi this is really unprofessional. Flight looks very old. My seat number is 31F. I will try to choose Air India express as my last option. I guess Air India should get privatised now.

### "really was a disappointment"
Chennai to Singapore. One of the worst flights travelled from ever! First sight experience:broken seats, torn seat covers, broken storage place,looked as if it wasn't cleaned in years! Ugliest flight! First and last time traveling in this one. Went by the name of Air India and it really was a disappointment!

### "had a horrible experience"
Not Verified | Dubai to Mumbai. I had a horrible experience travelling on July 4, from Dubai to Mumbai. First of, the flight got delayed by a full 6 hours and reschedule time was notified by email, just 6 hours before departure. This caused inconvenience to me and a lot of other passengers who were traveling ahead. Second, the ground staff was only shouting at passengers at Dubai airport to keep away and no explanation for the delay. In the meantime the flight further delayed by an hour. Apparently the flight did not take off from Mumbai and ground staff refused to check in passengers till it arrived! Finally we boarded after an 8-hour delay with no explanation or apologies from ground staff. They refused my cabin baggage saying the flight is "overbooked" a term I heard for first time in my ten years of international travel. After boarding I was shocked at the condition of aircraft. There was torn seats, no security handouts. I missed my onwards flight as well. This airline is pathetic, I would never ever book with again.

### "Please avoid this airline"
Dubai to Pune. Airline ticket cost me Rs 5500 only single wa ($80), a very low price. Checkin was on time at Dubai airport, 30kgs baggage allowed + 7 kgs handbag. Snack box water and tea provided in flight. Flight was 60% empty seats as maybe people dont like travelling with this airline. Departure was delayed by 25 minutes from Dubai airport due to traffic congestion. He apologised several times and covered the delay by 20mins on route. Overall we reached 5 minutes late in Pune from our expected time. A/C was turned off inflight in Dubai on ground for 35mins as we sat in our seat and only hot air was blowing. The A/C was turned on as we went in the sky and cooled in next 30mins. Maybe this was to save fuel on ground. Cabin condition was really poor. Seats were old and uncomfortable. Interiors was bad. I was afraid to use the toilet. Please avoid this airline. Looks like this airline needs private management and new systems to improve their condition.

### "second bad experience"
Me and my wife was travelling through Air India Express flight number XI-251 from Mumbai to Sharjah 21st April, 2018 (Saturday night). Timing for flight was 23:40 (IST) and landing timing at Sharjah airport was 01:25 (Gulf 4:00). We landed at 8:15 at Sharjah airport, almost 7 hours delay. Me and wife had work on Sunday and could not reach our office on time. In fact we took leave for that day, as we reached home around 10:30 post immigration. We lost a day of pay and included Friday and Saturday holiday also as loss without pay. Air India did not even offer for water to any passenger during whole delay. At first, Air India departed around 12:25 from Mumbai airport which was it self 1 hour delayed at departure. After almost 45-50 minutes fly, flight pilot announced that because of low fuel we have to fly back to Mumbai airport. Post announcement almost after 1:10 hrs fly we were back to Mumbai airport around 2:25 IST. We set in flight almost for an hour and many technicians came to check flight and were searching what was exactly error. By that time we all realised that there was some technical error and not related to fuel. Then 3:30 IST they allowed us transfer pass and again we moved to another gate to catch other flight. Some how they could able to manage another flight by 5:55 IST other flight. And finally, flights departed by 7:00 IST and which reached to Sharjah airport around 8:15 (GST 4:00). Really horrible experience we had ever. This was my second bad experience with Air India Express. I strongly recommend not to approach Air India Express at any cost.

### ground staff are so incompetent"
11 passengers were not given boarding passes to board the Mumbai – Doha flight leaving on 07/04/18 at 18.05hrs. They were not allowed to board the flight and were put on a flight to Bangalore leaving at 9pm to catch the 03.45am flight on the following day 08/04/18 to Doha by Qatar Airways. The ground staff are so incompetent. It is a high risk to fly with Air India Express. We all need an explanation why this was done but there is no answer from the phone numbers.

### "Worst airline in my life"
Delhi to Dubai. Don’t ever book with Air India Express. Worst airline with worst attention and customer service by crew to ground staff and even customer care. Finally they took my whole money to re schedule or cancellation. Worst airline in my life.

### Air India Express customer review
I was travelling from Madurai to Singapore with my Wife and three kids (Twin infants and toddler). The crew offered no help. Me and my wife were struggling to keep the hand luggage inside the cabin. Luckily one of the passenger after watching all this helped us to keep our luggage inside the cabin. Such a poor experience with Air India express. I dont understand why they have such a helpless and inhumane crew members.

### "air conditioning wasn't working"
Singapore to Chennai. Worst flight, No leg space, worst seats. Nothing is proper. Any other budget airline is still better than Air India Express. This aircraft should have been retired long ago. The seat cushion wasn't any more, windows and seats all were broken, air conditioning wasn't working.

### "Never fly Air India Express"
I had the worst experience from Sharjah to Trivandrum with Air India Express IX-536 on 21/12/2017. My flight was scheduled to be at 20.40 hrs from Sharjah but the departure was at 6.30 am next morning. But had a delay of 9 hours and 40 minutes. They keep on rescheduling and keep on sending text messages and we're made to wait for flight. Overall I would say. This flight not at all suitable for emergency and we'll planned trips. Never fly with Air India Express, you're never sure to arrive on time. This is completely unrespectful and not honest at all.

### "entire cabin wasn't in good condition"
Check in was extremely chaotic at both Mumbai to Sharjah. I was only checked in 1hr before departure in spite of arriving 2.5 hrs early at BOM. Air India handles Air India express check in at BOM and they were not helpful at all, more like clueless on how to handle the check in. Was hoping to at least fly on one of the newer planes. Unfortunately, on both sectors (BOM-SHJ & return), I flew on the older ones. Bringing positives in view first: Cabin Crew on both flights surprisingly stood out. All 4 or them were helpful in every way. Always received a "Your Welcome" when I thanked them. Another plus was the small snack box, consisting of juice, few snacks & a water bottle. Tea and coffee service was also done with refills provided, which was really nice. The crew were more than willing to offer one more snack box if requested. The seat was alright. However, coming to the negatives, the entire cabin wasn't in good condition. It gave a very old feeling. The washrooms did not have any lighting inside and it was dark if you had to use it. Overall, I would not recommend to fly with this airline as, they need to improve all areas from start to end to better the passenger experience. The crew are the only people who stand out.

### "Worst airline ever"
Singapore to Chennai. Worst airline ever. Old plane bad seats. Extremely rude staff. Never go for thsi airline price go for expensive one u will regret when u fly from this airline. I will never fly again. Told me to turn off phone even when its on flight mode.

### "Their flight delays very often"
Sharjah to Mumbai. Air India Express is less concerned about customer importance. Their flight delays very often. Never had any issue with other airlines but this one is very risky. They keep on rescheduling and keep on sending text messages and we're made to wait for flight. Overall I would say. This flight not at all suitable for emergency and we'll planned trips.

### "young and efficient crew"
My trip from Dubai to Mumbai was excellent. The flight was on time got my luggage in Mumbai on time. They had a young and efficient crew. The snacks provided were fresh and water was provided free (this is a budget airline). Dubai to Mumbai flight alcohol was served at a very reasonable cost. Return flight no Alcohol served don't know why? My return flight was delayed because of bad weather condition. I was notified on time which helped me spend 3 hours more with my family. The journey was pleasant and safe helping me have a enjoyable holiday.

### "the worst experience"
This was the worst experience from Calicut to Cochin with Air India Express. However, our flight of 45 min from Calicut to Cochin had a delay of 3 hours for no explicite reason except technical aspects, and we missed our 2 next flights with different airlines. Despite explaining the situation to 5 different people, nothing was done to help us, no refund or help to find new flights. Never fly with Air India Express, you're never sure to arrive on time. This is completely unrespectful and not honest at all.

### "regret this decision forever"
We travelled on Ar India Express for the first time on the trip from Delhi to Dubai return in September this year. I will regret this decision forever. To start with, the airconditioning was not working when we boarded the plane. That made it difficult to sit even for 10 minutes inside the plane. We shuddered at the thought of spending the 3.5  hour flight sweating. Thankfully the airconditioning started once we were airborne and reached a satisfactory level in about half an hour. We were seated in the row just before the emergency exits. The pushback buttons had been crudely taken out of our seats to prevent us from pushing the seats back. There was an inflight audio entertainment system in each seat but was not functional. One could see broken edges of seat arms, window sealings etc. all over the plane. The inflight staff did not have a groomed look, the meals provided were just passable. It was the same story on the return flight. Taken a vow to never fly with Air India Express again. Word of advice: not to be confused with Air India which is definitely a better service.

### "staff ran away"
I booked my Air India Express flight from Kuala lumpur to Chennai on 3rd Feb 2016 at 11.30 pm and I was informed at 6 pm that flight was late by one hour. Later when I reached airport, they informed the flight is delayed by 4 hours. Since I had connected flight from Chennai to Coimbatore at 6.30 on 4th Feb, I requested for assistance of staff in Kuala Lumpur - they took my data of connecting flights and promised me that alternative connecting flights will be arranged and informed to Officials in Chennai. But flight took only at 5 am on 4th Feb and it landed at 6.30 am in Chennai airport. My connecting flight had already departed the airport. When I required the Air India staff, they ran away as their duty is over and no one was there in the airport. Never seen such an experience in my life. I have to book a new connecting flight and flew to Coimbatore.

### "the flight was not enjoyable"
The check-in staff at Trivandrum airport were excellent. However the flight was not enjoyable. The meal was basic. The cost was not actually that much lower than the other airlines. The seats were a dingy red leather. Although the staff appeared to be attentive, they did not look enthused at all. On landing at Abu Dhabi, some passengers decided to get up from their seat before the plane had reached a complete stop. They stood up while the plane was moving and the cabin staff did nothing to get them back into their seat. In my many years of travel, I had never seen this before.

### Air India Express customer review
Took this flight because of convenient timing. Check in was smooth. Surprisingly they started boarding early, more than 1 hour before flight time. Plane was only 3 minutes from the terminal. We got to the plane and thee was no AC, temperature outside was over 40 degrees Celsius (Dubai in July). Passengers were getting very restless and children were crying due to heat. They had us on the plane for a very long time and we ended up leaving late, so more than 1 hour on the plane. AC only went on properly 15 minutes after take off. The aircraft was very very old and dirty. Flight was smooth and crew was friendly. They need to use newer planes, or reconsider. People use this because of timing and non-stop route to Pune. I think if there were better option no one would go on it.

### Air India Express customer review
I used travelled Air India Express back in September on AUH-COK-AUH sector. The fare was pretty much the best compared to other airlines. AUH-COK took off on time and with only less than 50 passengers on board due to off- season. The crew were pleasant and helpful. They provided snacks and even I got 3 bottles of water extra upon request. On the return the flight was almost full. Good service on time departure on both segments. Surprisingly there was not any IFE screens there. After describing the security and safety instructions the screens were turned off and folded back to the berth!

### Air India Express customer review
This is a summary of several flights I have taken on AIX on the Dubai-Pune-Dubai route. These flights were at a very convenient time during the day. Now they have been shifted to the early hours of the morning which makes it less convenient though still better than driving BOM-PNQ-BOM. All the flights I have taken so far have been smooth and excellent - take-offs landings and en route. Service is generally excellent and they surprisingly serve a small snack with unlimited water. I have invariably requested and obtained emergency exit seats with ample legroom. Toilets are clean again surprisingly but smell a bit. The main thing that needs to be improved is the maintenance of the cabin. The carpets are worn and the leather seats need refurbishing. The interior of these 738 aircraft need a good scrubbing. But other than that AIX does well on this route.

### Air India Express customer review
Flew from Dubai to Lucknow and back to Dubai. The crew seemed bored and the service was horrible. The table was broken and the meal served was inedible. The toilets were dirty. The seats were uncomfortable which made spending those hours on the aircraft unbearable. Choosing Air India Express was a poor choice in spite of the low cost tag attached to it.

### Air India Express customer review
Apart from having point to point connection there is nothing else that this airline can offer. I flew from Dubai to Amritsar and back and found this trip rather exhausting and uncomfortable due to the airline service. Being a budget carrier does mean to save costs but its doesn't mean to keep your aircraft's dirty and unhygienic. When I entered the aircraft both the times I felt as I am traveling in one of those public buses which are disposed for public use (to be honest even public buses are well maintained that Air India Express aircraft's) the crew looked angry for no reason it felt as if they were punished to come here and serve us they did not have the decency to speak politely with passengers and just dumped their frustration on us. Food was awful as everything looked stale and had no taste. Since this was the only flight available for me to reach Amritsar I was forced to take it.

### Air India Express customer review
Booked Dubai-Pune-Dubai in Jan 2014 however had to change the Dubai-Pune leg of the journey. My return journey (Pune-Dubai) was a nightmare. On arriving at the airport in the early hours of the morning I realized that my flight had been delayed for reasons unknown/unannounced to me. Then delayed 40 minutes in the security check line because other domestic flights need to be released earlier. After much delay I arrive at the final gate only to see no information displayed about my flight. Its delayed further. No one at any counter to enquire for any information. Felt relieved when the announcement to board was being made but there was more to come we were made to sit inside the aircraft as the pilots did not have clearance from ATC. It turned out to be for an hour or more until we finally were given clearance to fly. So a trip which I chose on purpose to save time and money did everything else but those two things.

### Air India Express customer review
Flew Pune to Dubai and back. Flight was on time in both legs. Seat quality could have been improved. No common inflight entertainment too as airline fell short of earphones for passengers so did not distribute any. Snacks were served but were unhealthy (deep fried). Air hostesses had a stern look through the journey. Cost of ticket was very less as compared to full service carriers.

### Air India Express customer review
Traveled SHJ-COK-SHJ last month. I have selected this flight because the holiday season started and IX was the cheapest available from UAE to Kochi. After my disastrous trip by Air India last month on the same sector I was not expecting much from IX but I should admit that I was surprised. Nice and clean aircraft with enough legroom polite cabin crew who were attending the passengers with a smile and on time take off and landing was part of the surprise package. And all these were for half the price of the next available airline.

### Air India Express customer review
DXB-PNQ-DXB. Check in was smooth at DXB T2 and I managed to get 1C. The plane from the inside looked a bit shabby as most AI aircraft somehow do but I was happy for the extra legroom for my 6'3" frame. A very overweight couple took seats 1A and B after smiling sheepishly at me. The man was overflowing into my seat. I saw that 1D was empty and moved over. AIX served a flimsy cardboard box containing a sandwich a small packet of banana chips something fried and inedible and a muffin. Strange assortment but better than nothing and welcome on a low cost carrier. Unlimited water as well. Drinks are chargeable. Flight left about 30 minutes late but arriving into PNQ was a breeze and I was home in 10 minutes after leaving the airport. Check-in in PNQ for the return leg was chaotic as usual and the woman insisted my bags were overweight. I smiled a lot and finally after I removed my laptop from my hand luggage she let me go through and even gave me a reclining exit row seat. The seat bottom was worn out and the metal bar kept poking my rear. When I asked for a blanket (even a used blanket) I was told they had run out of them. I avoided serious long term damage to my tailbone by moving and shifting through the flight. Same food was served on this leg. Overall it was good value for money. But basic maintenance a word missing in India's lexicon could be better. Sitting on metal for 3 hours is no fun.

### Air India Express customer review
DXB-IXE. Boarded with apprehension but quite pleasantly surprised. Reasonably clean aircraft pleasant crew and food! Not bad for a budget airline and way better than Air India (the so called full service airline). Have flown them a couple of times again on the same sector.

### Air India Express customer review
I am regular passenger in UAE-Kerala route. Flights seems to be fairly reasonable compared to the fare structure and clean. Crew helpful. But the snacks to be supplied as per the timing. On mid night flights supplying banana chips and cakes really upset the stomach. Any toasted bread sandwiches (veg or non-veg) would be more ideal which will not add up the cost to the airlines. The fare calculation methods seems strange. Sometimes a person buying an online ticket far earlier before 1 or two months pays more than someone take it on the day or previous day of the flight. Also the taxes calculation. More basic fare is with less tax and vice versa. Recently the cancellation charges have been increased to 35% which is really unbearable. It should be reversed to 10% before 10 days and 15% prior to 24 hrs at least.

### Air India Express customer review
Singapore to Calcutta return. An adequate performance from this budget carrier. The flights were on time the comfort was adequate and the staff generally reasonably friendly. The only slight downside was the quality of food offered in the snackbox - barely edible pastries and deep fried cookies. However the flight is only about 4 hours so having little to eat wasn't a big problem. The tickets were 50% cheaper than the only other carrier to offer non-stop flights on this route (Singapore Air) so overall I was extremely pleased with Air India Express.

### Air India Express customer review
TRZ to KUL via Chennai return. The aircraft was relatively clean on both sectors. Since this was the only flight to Trichy from Kuala Lumpur I thought it would be more practical to just take this flight since there is no hassle of getting out into Chennai. However the transit procedure in Chennai is terrible. We had to get on bus queue up till everyone got off the plane and go though security check again. For the price you pay the service is not at all worthwhile.

### Air India Express customer review
I paid INR 13000 on IX flight from Kolkata to Singapore compared to about 21000 in SQ. The aircraft was clean crew reasonably friendly. They served snacks on the flight. I would say if they keep the aircraft clean and maintains time it's good value for money. I would have to fly few more times to see if they are reliable!

### Air India Express customer review
Used IX for a domestic flight from BOM-COK. I have to say for the fare I paid I was not expecting much. A spotless aircraft and a hospitable crew. Overall a very average airline which offers value for money.

### Air India Express customer review
My third flight on IX (from Dubai to Cochin) and quite possibly my last. It appears that there is no cabin maintenance at all. Most seat cushions badly soiled - as if the plane had been used to carry livestock. No paper or cloth covers for the head rests. Carpet in a filthy and lamentable state throughout the cabin. At first I thought the window I was sitting next to was covered in a layer of condensation. I then found out it was a film of grease and grime with the window frame covered in a brownish substance containing lots of human hair.

### Air India Express customer review
Air India Express from Cochin to Dubai on 25/11/05. Aircraft quite new and thanks to being seated in one of two emergency exit rows lots of leg room. Despite travelling on a low cost airline you nevertheless are served a snack consisting of sandwich cake fruit juice water coffee or tea. On the downside the passenger next to me was allowed boarding in a clearly less than sober state and the crew continued to serve him hard liquor throughout the flight (alcoholic beverages available on a for sale basis). He even managed to complete the entire flight without ever having availed of the seat belt. Also despite being a non-smoking flight crew were quite relaxed at seeing the lavatories being used continuously as smoking rooms - with the obvious and objectionable result of extremely bad air quality in the cabin throughout the flight.
