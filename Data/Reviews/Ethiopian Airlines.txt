### “I have received nothing but silence”
I am appalled by the utter negligence and lack of professionalism displayed by Ethiopian Airlines. My baggage was delayed for five full days during my international trip to Cape Town. I submitted a compensation claim back in December 2024, providing every required document and receipt for the essential items I had to purchase due to their failure. Since then, I have sent multiple follow-up emails (Dec 30, Jan 21, Mar 1, Mar 20), and I have received nothing but silence. Not a single update, not even an apology. How can a supposedly “leading African airline” justify completely ignoring a customer for over four months? This experience has been not only frustrating but also deeply disrespectful. I’ve spent hours chasing a basic response that any responsible airline would’ve handled in days. I have been left with no choice but to escalate this publicly. If this is the kind of service Ethiopian Airlines provides, they do not deserve to be in business.

### "seats were in a standard row"
Flight ET718 from Addis Ababa to Gatwick on 27th March. We had booked and paid £100 for extra legroom seats which was confirmed on our ticket. Checked in and got boarding pass with same seat numbers. However, on boarding, discovered the seats were in a standard row. It appears our earlier booking used a seat plan for Boeing 787-8 (exit row 28) whereas Ethiopian airlines switched aircraft to Boeing 787-9 (exit row 30). Surely when the boarding passes were printed the booking system should reallocate us to our requested legroom seats. What a shambles. Two other passengers on our flight also got bumped into standard seats. We have also had previous problems using the Ethiopian airlines website (paid twice for same seat reservation). Seems their IT System is flakey and unreliable. Pity because the flight staff seemed mostly helpful and organised.

### "a complete disaster"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Addis Ababa to Frankfurt on January 20 was a complete disaster. When we got to our seats, a woman with a child was sitting in one of them and refused to move. She claimed the flight attendants told her she could take the seat for her child. Instead of resolving the issue, the crew did nothing, and we had to argue, wave our boarding passes in their faces, and fight for the seats we had paid for. And that was just the beginning: my food was disgusting. The crew ignored complaints.

### "well taken care of"
My wife and I flew with Ethiopian from Toronto to Entebbe Uganda return. We also flew Entebbe to Mombasa return within the time we stayed in Africa. We found that the airline service was pretty much on time and we didn't miss any connections. The meals were consistently good. Most aircrafts were in fair to good in cleanliness. The flight attendants were very good, friendly and attended to all of our needs. On our return flight my wife was injured and couldn't walk. We made arrangements with the airline in advance and they attended to all of her needs advancing us to the front of every line and helping us with our luggage. We were very surprised and well taken care of. I found that the service by the attendants to be excellent but I feel that the work loads on the was enormous. The attendants tried their best in serving our needs.

### “zero accountability for passengers”
Ethiopian Airlines are never on time. Each flight that I seem to fly with this airline seems to have a minimum delay of an hour. They don't seem to care that people have connection flights or other important plans. I am currently sitting on the tarmac in the plane waiting to depart but we cannot because they are still loading cargo at the expense of their passengers. It is always at the expense of their passengers. My past flight with them we departed Namibia 3 hours late and most people missed their connection flights and Ethiopian Airlines told the passengers it was not their problem. They offered no assistance and left people to fend for themselves. They have zero accountability for their passengers. If I did not have to fly with them I would not. Ethiopian Airlines drastically needs to do something about customer services and ensuring that people are cared for correctly. You are providing a service to paying customers start acting like it.

### "there was nothing positive"
The plane was very dirty, debris everywhere on the floor and between the seats. Broken TV screens, non-working buttons and service lights, there was nothing positive about these flights.

### "instructed my wife make seat upright"
My wife had her seat (11D what they call a priority seat with extra charge) 50% reclined. Passenger behind on 12F didn’t like this and started shouting at my wife, touching and threatening her. Cabin crew passed by and instructed my wife make seat upright instead of protecting her. Incidence reported to supervisor, she investigated instantly and apologised, however, passenger continued misbehaving. Flight was full, many passengers had bigger luggage than allowed. When we boarded, no more overhead locker space was available around our seat, we stowed the luggage at locker 15. At the time of debarking, luggage couldn’t be found. We had to wait until all passengers left to find the luggage in another compartment far away, crew had removed it?

### "a very pleasant flight"
Not Verified |  Was a very pleasant flight, the crew was very helpful at all times, I was an unaccompanied minor, and throughout the journey the crew helped me with all the procedures, the flight was very comfortable. Would definitely use Ethiopian Airlines whenever I’m traveling and would recommend it to friends and family. Most of all Ms Leli was the best.

### “disgraceful service”
I am writing this feedback out of sheer frustration and disappointment regarding the disgraceful service I have received from Ethiopian Airlines concerning my missing baggage. It has been 6 days since my flight ET940 & ET692 from KAN to Addis & Addis to MAA on 29 Jan 2025 and my baggage is still missing. Despite countless follow-ups, I have received little to no assistance, empty promises, and no reasonable compensation for the inconvenience your airline has caused me. The lack of accountability, professionalism, and basic customer service in handling this matter is unacceptable. I expected Ethiopian Airlines to value its passengers, but this experience has shown the complete opposite. My multiple attempts to get a clear update have been ignored, and instead of providing a real solution, your representatives have only offered vague and useless responses. Because of your airline’s negligence, I have suffered significant financial loss, stress, and inconvenience. I have been forced to replace essential items at my own expense, and yet Ethiopian Airlines has refused to take responsibility or offer fair compensation. This is completely unacceptable for an international airline that claims to care about its customers. Your handling of this issue is beyond disappointing—it is outright disrespectful to your passengers.

### "Crew was friendly and professional"
From Athens to Zanzibar on B737M8 and A350 all flights were on time. B737 was with no IFE and seats were uncomfortable for the 5 hour flight. A350 was with IFE and comfortable seats, our flight was only 2 hours. On ATH-ADD was offered dinner and on ADD-ZNZ was offered breakfast. Crew was friendly and professional. In Tanzania were very strict with carry-on bag, mine was 11 kg and they did not allow me to carryon, I had to check-in as a luggage. They allow 8 Kg carry on.

### “treated like I was flying economy”
Not Verified | Flew Business class but was treated like I was flying economy. No water offered. Had to ask for a headset. Steward was wearing an airpod. No greeting on entry or exit from the aircraft. Washrooms were filthy. Thank goodness it was a short flight. Would never take a long haul flight with this airline.

### "Terrible flight experience"
Terrible flight experience. Rude flight attendants. The worst food I have ever had on a flight. Broken seat that don’t recline. Last minute seat changes that I did not ask for or authorize after choosing my seat more than a month in advance. For the price of these tickets, they need to do way better.

### "Not the best customer service"
Not the best customer service. Requested wheelchair service and did not get it on the first leg. Had to fight for it on the second leg. The seat wasn’t the most comfortable. On the airbus, there are air vents for individual seats. When we first got on the plane, it was very hot. In Monrovia, the ticket service was horrible. We stood in one line and was told we had to stand in another because of the wheelchair service. And the lines were long. An item may have been left on the plane and we cannot get in touch with anybody to inquire about lost and found. The operator on the phone barely understood what I was saying language barrier. She gave me a number for the DC location. No one answered the phone and unable to leave a message. It’s amazing to me how bad the customer service is

### “Worst business class experience”
Worst business class experience you can possibly imagine. 1) Security riot before gate 19 made us almost late for our flight. No special security entrance for business class customers in Ethiopian Airlines home airport. It was a disaster. People getting crushed, children crying, Elderly getting trampled. 2) Flight left late at Addis and also Rome making us miss our connection flight in Toronto. No help. 3) Same gluten free meal for each leg of the flight and it was awful. 4) Baby crying in business class for 15 hours. Staff did nothing. I paid for an upgraded seat to be kept awake the whole flight.

### "the toilets became dirty"
Towards the end of the flight, the toilets became dirty and unhygienic. During the pre-landing phase, I was awoken by a flight attendant unbuckling my seatbelt and removing my blanket. Such behavior is highly unprofessional. After landing in Nairobi and before the passengers started to disembark, the aircraft's power shut down. This resulted in a lack of ventilation and air conditioning for nearly 20 minutes.

### “Worst service ever”
Worst service ever. Beside delaying our flight for 12hours, our baggage got delayed and no one bothers to answer follow up calls. Our whole holiday was ruined because of Ethiopian Airlines poor service, imagine reaching on holiday with no clothes and basic personal needs. We missed out on a whole day of paid planned activities and hotel booking. I hope never to use this airline again.

### “service fell painfully short”
My recent journey from Washington Dulles (IAD) to Addis Ababa (ADD) on Ethiopian Airlines left much to be desired. Despite the promise of smooth air travel, the service fell painfully short at every stage. Boarding Chaos: The boarding process was an unorganized disaster, dragging on for nearly an hour. No communication, no clear instructions—just utter confusion that could’ve easily been avoided with better planning and staff coordination. Clueless Cabin Crew: Once onboard, I was met with shocking unhelpfulness. A steward noticed there was no room for my bags but simply stared blankly, offering no solution or assistance. I had to figure out on my own to place them under the seat in front of me. The crew’s inability (or unwillingness) to provide basic support was insulting. Unprofessional Behavior: The icing on the cake? A steward reached over my husband—without so much as a word—to grab a duty-free magazine. Not only did she fail to excuse herself, but she didn’t even bother to return the magazine afterward. This lack of courtesy and respect is completely unacceptable on an international flight. Overall, the disorganization, lack of professionalism, and dismissive attitude of the cabin crew made for a truly frustrating experience. Ethiopian Airlines needs to seriously rethink their training and customer service standards. Travelers deserve better.

### "Ethiopian Airlines needs to do better"
I just landed from an Ethiopian airline ET516 from Lome to IAD. This was an 11 hr flight. Shortly after takeoff, the TV entertainment stopped working in my row of 3 seats. I glanced at a few other monitors and all seemed to be in my state. The tv screens didn’t respond to button presses or screen touch. This means, for the 11 hours, there was no entertainment. The button for overhead light also stopped working. For long swatches of time, the cabin was pitch black. I guess this was by design. Needless to say this experience was a nightmare. Ethiopian Airlines needs to do better.

### “I felt like I was back in the 90's”
HKG-BKK-ADD-LAD-ADD-VIE-CPH Ethiopian is not the worst airline I've ever flown, but it's definitely not very good. Cabin crew fluctuated between friendly and helpful, to unenthusiastic with a feeling that they had given up making an effort a long time ago. Most of the planes I flew were old. With touch screens that didn't work, and with a joystick where you press the buttons to control a mouse cursor that sloooowly moves across the screen. I felt like I was back in the 90's. The wifi did not work on roughly 75% of the flights I was on. When it did, the speeds were quite good. Toilets were, on some of the flights, disgusting. They were definitely not cleaned or refreshed regularly, and smelled really bad. On other flights they were okay. On the ADD-VIE-CPH leg the plane was a dreamliner, with more modern seats and screens. However, the inflight entertainment system was riddled with bugs. No movies would play without buffering and stuttering, making it impossible to watch for more than 10 seconds. Many screens were stuck in a neverending reboot sequence, even though the crew kept trying to reset them. On top of that, every time there was a crew announcement, the movie selection screen would reset, forcing you to scroll the list of movies all over again. Not that it mattered, as no movies were watchable due to the skipping and stuttering. On this leg, we were served a pasta salad with shrimp. I found a hair in my food, and made the cabin crew aware of this. They responded by offering me a new set of cutlery. When I asked for another pasta salad, the one I received had exactly one shrimp in it. I had the clear feeling that hair in the food would not be reported anywhere. There was no apology from the crew either. I was put on this itinerary by work, but I would never chose Ethiopian airlines for my own money.

### "expected much more"
Service was not there at all. Flight was delayed due to inbound flight arriving late which is understandable. But they took way too long to turnover and clean with no instructions or explanation on ground. Everyone was just waiting with no idea how long to wait. When we boarding, flight attendant sounded annoyed, pointing to which aisle. We got seated and saw a more senior flight attendant sitting till take off. After take off she didn’t do much as well. Safety demonstration was a short video. Crew didn’t bother checking and making sure I was secured. Aircraft was in a relatively poor condition. Bottom of the toilet door was already falling apart, 3 charging ports between us not working, leaning back function of my seat was rough, difficult to get it moving. Even a smoking sign is inverted. Table was dirty and we were seated first row with flight attendant not even asking if we wanted the entertainment. Flight attendant provided close to no service at all. Food was ok, just weird. Flight attendant came over and asked chicken or beef without telling us what was each. So we took a beef and a chicken. What’s funny was the beef was actually lamb. Meat was still ok. But the rice for the beef was hard. The other bread, biscuits, butter and cheese were the usual packaged stuff. Pasta salad tasted weird and chocolate cake was sweet. Towards the end of our flight, flight attendant were busy packing stuff. They even poured juices into the toilet. Prior to landing, flight attendant didn’t do landing checks to make sure things were secured. When we left, no goodbyes or a smile. Honestly expected much more from a full fledge and Africa best airline. Only compliment was the Singaporean stuff in Tokyo. Extremely friendly, polite and helpful.

### “the most uncomfortable flight”
Not Verified | It was the most uncomfortable flight and the service was terrible. We barely recieved a greeting when boarding. The in-flight device was sub-par and no wi-fi. We had a roundtrip from Atlanta to Lusaka and during my stay I had a death in my immediate family and had to change my departure date to attend the funeral. We went to Ethiopian Airlines office in Lusaka and they were very cold and lacked customer service. We waited for hours to speak with someone and it felt like they were deliberately ignoring us. After hours of waiting they asked for a death certificate and mind you thats not produced on the same day a person passes away. We returned at a later date with documentation and they refused to change my departure date and they informed me a change in date was impossible and if I missed my flight I would have to pay for a new ticket at full price so I ended up paying for another ticket at full price to stay for bereavement. Ethiopian staff were not empathetic and did not take into consideration that my initial ticket was already expense. On the flights the flight crew spoke in their native language and ignored everyone that did not speak their language. It was obvious they were not happy to service the passengers and only smiled when they spoke with their fellow Ethiopians.

### “didn’t like the flight or the service”
The staff had a rather average attitude. They were not amiable at all and seemed too busy to be attentive. I did not like their approach, and I did not feel special. The food was good, but the internet didn’t work. A flight attendant gave me another passenger’s login, but it still didn’t work. After landing, the flight attendants didn’t say goodbye to us and weren’t present at the doors. In general, I didn’t like the flight or the service.

### “appalling customer service experience”
Not Verified | Stranded, Ignored, and Betrayed: Ethiopian Airlines’ Customer Service Nightmare, Why This Airline Is the Last Choice You Should Make for Your Holiday Travel. Imagine standing at an airport, anxiously awaiting a call from a loved one who is finally coming home—suddenly, your phone rings—they are panicked, telling you they have been denied boarding. No explanation. No warning. Nothing. This happened to my elderly mother, a woman in her 80s with limited mobility, who Ethiopian Airlines inexplicably refused to board her long-awaited flight from Accra to Atlanta on August 17, 2024. A nightmare followed: an appalling customer service experience that left her stranded in Ghana while the airline ignored our pleas. If you are considering Ethiopian Airlines, especially for the holiday season, heed this warning: their customer service ranks among the worst in the industry. They operate with no accountability, no empathy, and no respect for the people who trust them. The Shocking Refusal: Abandoning an Elderly Passenger My mother had been planning her visit to the U.S. for months. We booked her Ethiopian Airlines flight, code CFNFQS, scheduled for August 17th, and even arranged for their “Meet and Assist” service, designed to offer wheelchair assistance and attentive care for elderly passengers. Every detail was prepared, every arrangement secured—or so we thought. But when she arrived at Kotoka International Airport in Accra, Ethiopian Airlines’ supervisor, (Edward A. Parker), blocked her from boarding. His vague reasoning? Medical reasons”. However, he never explained further, nor did he provide any documentation or reach out to the family member who booked her ticket. The airline’s silence was chilling. Ethiopian Airlines had both my contact information and the option to explain why a paying, elderly customer with limited mobility was suddenly unfit to board. Yet they did nothing. No call, no email, no apology. Their complete disregard for my mother’s distress in Ghana went beyond poor customer service. It was inhumane. Desperate for Answers: Two Months of Silence In the aftermath, I contacted Ethiopian Airlines repeatedly, reaching out through every possible channel: emails to their CEO, messages to customer service, and calls to their Accra airport management. Surely, I thought, they would want to address such an egregious oversight. I was wrong. Weeks turned into months without a single response. The silence was deafening. Initially, I connected with Mrs. Meron Masresha, the Team Leader at Ethiopian Airlines' Global Customer Interaction Center at Bole International Airport. She forwarded my complaint to Mr. Abiy Solomon, the Accra Airport Services Manager, who even requested my nephew’s contact details to discuss the incident directly. After I provided them, Ethiopian Airlines vanished once again—no follow-up, no email, no acknowledgment. It was as though my mother’s traumatic experience did not exist. A Blatant Breach of Trust This debacle extended beyond a simple inconvenience; it shattered the very foundation of trust. Ethiopian Airlines’ refusal to respond or provide even basic compensation reveals their blatant disregard for their customers. Their policies state that denied boarding compensation applies when a passenger meets all check-in requirements and is refused boarding for reasons beyond their control. My mother fulfilled every requirement, yet received no compensation, no refund, and no answers.

### "appreciative of his persistence"
Not Verified | Because of a very tight connection on our return we had a feeling we might struggle with our luggage arriving on time. None of our bags arrived in Chicago, three were returned to us within 2 days and the 3rd was lost for 3 weeks. While this was inconvenient and frustrating, I am incredibly grateful for the help of customer service agent Frew. He worked very closely with me for those three weeks keeping me posted as best he could on the whereabouts of my suitcase, which we learned had been misdirected. Just when I thought I'd lost my bag forever, Frew called to tell me it'd been found. I am appreciative of his persistence to my case and was overjoyed to reunite with my luggage. He remained optimistic and focused, which helped me to stay calm about this situation.

### "the most terrible company"
Not Verified |  I started my trip at Antananarivo to Brussels, with a stop in Addis Ababa. At the airport of Antananarivo they could not give me a boarding card for the flight from Addis Ababa to Brussels. They told me to get a boarding card at Addis Ababa airport, but they checked in my luggage to Brussels. At Addis Ababa airport there were many people with problems as I had to wait for 2 hours at the customer service desk. They gave me a stand by ticket and said it would be no problem to get a seat, this was lie number 1. On the boarding card gate A10 was mentioned while on the screens B5 would be the gate to board for the flight ET730. I have asked customer service several times what the correct gate would be. They kept saying the correct gate was A10, even when boarding already started at B7, which was mentioned nowhere and was not on the screens, not even on the screen of gate B7, this was lie number 3. All customers with a stand by ticket, had to wait. Then they closed the door  and the plane left without many standby by ticket travellers. Our seats were not secured, the plane was overbooked. After the plane left a supervisor promised us he would take care of an alternative flight, our luggage, compensation, and a place to sleep. Then he ran off and did nothing for us. According to the policy of Ethiopian Airlines they should offer us a hotel to stay. After a few hours I finally managed to get a boarding pass for a flight one day later. I had to spend the night and day at the airport, got no food or drinks, nothing. Ethiopian Airlines is by far the most terrible company I have had a flight with, or actually no flight with. The personnel are extremely rude and keep lying.

### “staff very welcoming and supportive”
Not Verified | As disclaimer, I am a big fan of Ethiopian Airlines. They have such an amazing route network, and I just like the spirit onboard. On this trip, I once again was very happy with my choice. Here is why: The ticket fare was decent (and way cheaper than a major competitor), the flight times are just perfect (but I can easily sleep in planes), I liked the food and beverage service (incl. Habesha beer), the staff is very welcoming and supportive, and the coffee stop-over in Addis priceless. As an added (and very smart) bonus a free train ticket is included, so no need for silly short-distance flights to reach Frankfurt. OK, in-flight entertainment is just ok-ish, but I couldn't care less. I do look forward to my next trip with this airline.

### "airline is NEVER on time"
Not Verified | This airline is NEVER on time. Sadly there is no other choice to fly within the country and why they do not care for keeping to schedules. I have had bags not loaded on another trip with 2 hours sitting on the runway in Addis. They never give passengers any information about what is happening. Really bad customer service and not a good airline. Thankfully the in staff are lovely but don't fly with them if you are help it

### “did not load my luggage”
Not Verified | They did not load my luggage despite getting to the airport 3 hours before travel time. I got to Nairobi and my Luggage was on its way to Addis but only got it 3 days later.

### "they won't respond"
On their website they claim excellent customer service, daily updates on lost luggage and USD 100 compensation. I have received none of the above. 76 hours after landing, nothing. Don't bother to email, they won't respond. On a much smaller note, don't bother to pay extra for a special meal, mine wasn't booked.

### "the luggage was never loaded"
Our flight ET629 was delayed by over 5 hours owing to bad weather, resulting in our missed connection to Kigali. To cut a long story short, it was a nightmare to get ourselves on the next available flight. They had inexplicably put us on the following morning’s flight which would have meant that we missed 2 days of our tour instead of 1. They had the audacity initially to ask for additional payment of USD250 each for the earlier flight when we were prepared to downgrade from business to economy!. It was only with the intervention of 1 kind staff in ADD airport, that we managed ultimately to get on the next flight to Kigali. Arriving well past mid-night, we had a rude shock when we realised our luggage did not make it. This despite our conscientious checks at every leg of the travel with the ET staff. Every single one claimed that our luggage was loaded. It turned out that either every single one lied or the system was wrong. Through Star Alliance, we subsequently realised the luggage was never loaded in the first place from Bangkok. Adding insult to injury, not once did ET  apologize for the ordeal or contact us. We only learnt that our luggage arrived the next morning when the Rwanda Lost Luggage personnel called our agent to inform him. We requested ET to provide us with official confirmation of the various delays (in support of our insurance claims) and was again sent on a “not so merry go round” with again “sympathetic noises made” but no action or follow up. On the return flight, they refused to check in our luggage to the final destination in Singapore, claiming that they could not do so as our final leg was with Singapore Airlines. This despite the fact that Singapore Airlines is part of Star Alliance. It should be noted that Singapore Airlines was able to check our luggage in from Singapore to Kigali. In a separate call with Singapore Airlines, the staff confirmed that ET should have checked the luggage in all the way to Singapore. So again, we were severely stressed as we had to clear customs in Bangkok, collect our bags and check in again for our flight to Singapore. All to be done within 2 hours. Lo and behold, we ran to the luggage belt only wait and subsequently see “Delayed Baggage” - no explanation, no apology. It was nothing short of a miracle for us to eventually make it on our Singapore Airline flight. To be fair, the service from the crew on board was good, the food was fair and the beverages good. But the rest of the ground staff (other than the one solitary gem - Amen) are a disgrace. I will not recommend anyone to take this airline.

### "Luggage is never on schedule"
Not Verified | I lost part of luggage from the duty free shop from Bole to Buq, got into contact with the Doha office. The gentlemen promised to look into my issue and said it would take time. Nothing has been said about that. Recently I requested to change my travel dates and to my surprise I was charged QR 150 yet there were still 7 days before departure. The attendant called it a penalty. I thought I had come in early but alas. Luggage is never on schedule and yet there are no concessions. If you are paying by card there is a 10.0% surcharge they actually want cash. We cannot be forced to give them cash through shady rules. I await a day when there will be more flights on the African routes and we will see who will be stuck to blood suckers.

### "Boeing 737 MAX 8 which is not ideal"
I travel almost every weekend between Addis and Joburg. I have no choice but to use ET airlines as they have the only direct flights between these locations. First concern is that they use the Boeing 737 MAX 8 which is not ideal for international flights. No entertainment for economy class for 5 hours, the lavatories  malfunction. On some occasions, ET will place us on the big Boeing with screens and entertainment, but my screen wouldn't work ... the flight attendant offered me the worst seat (next to the toilet). I declined, and she wasn't even bothered, no apology. The final stroke is when they wanted to take our hand luggage because there was no space in the plane. I don't think they respect the passengers going to South Africa.

### "not be able to leave the airport"
I communicated with the airline in advance that I would not be able to leave the airport because I was traveling with an emergency travel document If I bought the 10-hour layover in Addis Ababa from New York's final destination Namibia. The airline as per their policy offered me an in-terminal hotel. On check-in at JFK New York, the agent offered me a voucher for a Presidential hotel. I reiterated that I would not be able to leave the airport. She then said I could change my voucher on arrival in Addis Ababa at the customer service desk. My first experience in flight started with my screen being damaged with lines across the screen, seat 24H. I stayed in the same seat during our layover in Abidjan. On arrival in Addis, I was referred to the Interlink office. I have never been so belittled by a Customer service agent who had the nerve to tell me it was not his fault my passport was not valid. He went on to dismiss me and walked away as I was trying to get answers. His final response was that the Skyline hotel in the terminal was for business class travelers only. Two days ago, I looked at this hotel, and it would have cost me $75 for 5 hours. He offered me dinner and a public bench for 10 hours. I walked back to the customer service desk who offered me access to the gold lounge. He took me to a quiet room I could use, and as a woman, he allowed me to sleep in a darkened room with 4 strange men. I am sitting and writing this in the lounge trying to stay awake for the next 6 hours before my last leg to Windhoek. The food in the lounge is dry, The bar that's supposedly open 24 hours is closed.

### "a nightmare of a trip"
Ethiopian airlines changed my flight ET844 from the 26th May to 28th May without informing me, I only realised they did that less than 24hrs, I called the call center and they could confirm changing my first leg from CPT to ADD, however they said they are waiting for confirmation from Egyptair because they operate the next leg from ADD to Cairo ( according to my original booking that should have been ET 452). I go to the airport CPT and they say it will be confirmed when I arrive in ADD. I arrive in ADD and they tell me my booking is confirmed but I will get my boarding pass at the gate and I have to wait in the airport for 7.10 hours. I told the officer please if my ticket is not confirmed then I can take the next day flight and get an hotel, he said no you are on this flight. 6 hrs later I go to the gate at 4 am (departure at 5.15am) and the woman at the gate A8 was the least helpful and very rude person, she refused to call interline and told me I am not on this flight and go sort it myself. I spoke to Egyptair and he told me its not my problem it is Ethiopian Airlines mess to sort out. At the end I had to wait for Interline officers to arrive, and they booked me on the next day's flight at 10pm, so I had to spend 24hrs in ADD airport. This was a nightmare of a trip.

### "complicated process of trying to cancel"
The website check out process is faulty. After several attempts to book the website generated error messages and no booking or confirmation. Later I found out that they had reserved several thousand dollars and created several bookings without my knowledge. This led to a complicated process of trying to cancel and retrieve my money. Their customer service was bad and had no apology. Nor were they helpful in deleting/altering the multiple bookings that were incorrect.

### “wrote several emails and no response”
I flew from Kuala Lumpur to Addis Ababa with a brief stop over at Singapore then proceeded to Addis then connect to Nairobi via a different aircraft, ET318. I lost my luggage and launched a property irregularity report at JKIA Nairobi where I was provided a file reference number and online site to track it. A week went and no update. Their 'check status of the bag and manage file online' platform allows for editing and adding information to help trace the bag. I did all this, and after some days wrote a message in the same platform but no one responded back. I went to the Ethiopian website and located contact numbers for lost baggage plus email address. I tried the numbers listed and no one was picking. I wrote several emails and no response. This is the worst experience for Ethiopian Airlines having an online platform that is just there to fool the customers whereas there is no one who monitors it, and if there is, then they are just lousy. A month is gone and up to date no feedback and no one to reach out to.

### "cabin crew were truly amazing"
Not Verified |   I normally don’t do reviews but today was exceptional because after a long time of losing hope on Ethiopian Airlines provided services and the service givers today I got to encounter something that has made me restore my hope on them again. We flew from Bangkok to Addis and our cabin crew were truly amazing, especially Jaleni, she was the reason I had to write this review. She greeted us with a spectacular smile and while in flight she took her time to treat everyone patiently and made sure we were truly comfortable. Honestly I was amazed to experience this because normally our flights with Ethiopian Airlines has to encounter with a situation that would disappoint us but this flight with The whole cabin crew on that flight were superb.

### "the worst I’ve experienced"
The quality of aircraft, food, entertainment and ground service are one of the worst I’ve experienced. Service is always friendly in the air though. The seat (business class) was dirty and the power did not work. The entertainment system must have been 15 years old with almost no new entertainment options. The food was overall pretty terrible - dry and weird tasting. I could not eat most of it. No wifi entire flight even though it was advertised. Addis airport is a mess. Dirty and crowded. Very disorganized.

### "not having my luggage"
Lost luggage was sent to Malabo but we were nor informed and the luggage was not updated on the system. Been washing and wearing wet clothes each morning. Will never fly with them again. As an offshore worker, not having my luggage, equipment to do my job is inside, and deodorant etc is really a horrible situation. Cannot believe that the airline has become so shockingly useless.

### "Another brilliant flight"
Not Verified |   Another brilliant flight. Sensible meal after 00.20 take off from Addis Breakfast large at 05.00. Everything fine. Arrived 3 minutes late. Fly very regularly with ET both from London and within Ethiopia Also flew to Windhoek and back from Cape Town in March.

### "ultimately delayed by 4 hours"
This flight was ultimately delayed by 4 hours, which caused several things to go wrong during our further journey. Firstly, a 1 hour delay was announced due to 'technical problems', then another 1 hour due to 'staff problems'. Then it is said that the flight has been moved to 4:30, so an additional 2 hours. After this, water and dinner are provided, for which thanks, but we can hardly sit anywhere. You are not allowed to take a seat in restaurants in the area. This should have been communicated between employees and a plan made. We then leave unclear what will happen next with the adjacent flight that we will miss; this was the 7 hour flight from Vienna to Amsterdam. An employee says they are going to rebook and we are receiving emails. We never received this. We arrive in Vienna and here Austrian airlines can solve it for you. They book a flight to Amsterdam via Frankfurt, which is first delayed to 7:30 PM and later cancelled. This leaves us stuck in Frankfurt. Then we had to rebook again to come to the Netherlands. We received this via Hannover, 9:10 on April 16. Initially there was no hotel included and we had to call Ethiopian airlines. Called this and the employee on the other end seemed to have poor English or had difficulty understanding us due to the connection. We understood her clearly. She tells us that ET has no accommodation and so we have to be on our own. Fortunately, we were still able to get a hotel voucher with dinner and breakfast from KLM. So they had provided something. A received respons from ET said this: First of all, we would like to thank you for choosing Ethiopian Airlines for your trip to Africa. We are deeply sorry and want to apologize for the inconveniences caused to you by the delay of flight ET 724 on 14.04.2024 from Addis Ababa Vienna. Of course, this does not comply with the high expectations of quality and service that Ethiopian Airlines promises and that our customers can expect on all of our flights. Regarding your claim for compensation due to the delay of the flights, we are sorry to tell you that Ethiopian Airlines is not able to meet your demands. The EG No. 261/2004 act from 17th December 2004 Art. 9 and the verdict of the EuGH from 19th November 2009 refer only to domestic flights or flights that depart from EU-countries and airlines that are registered in the EU. The settlement regarding compensation payment unfortunately is not applicable in your case which means that Ethiopian Airlines is not liable for compensation. Thank you for understanding that we cannot give any refunds for neither lump-sum payments nor subsequent damages like missed holidays or appointments. It is our utmost concern that you can put your trust in Ethiopian Airlines again on future flights, where we would be happy to prove our reliability to you once again. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions. Never again.

### "onboard team were pleasant enough"
Not Verified |   The Boeing 787-8 is dated, the seat doesn’t recline fully flat. The A350 with the 1-2-1 configuration is a fully flat seat with a reasonable amount of room. The IFE selection is limited. Ethiopian have a deserved reputation for short notice changes. Despite checking in 48 hours in advance on arrival at VFA we were told our seats had been changed. When we got to Addis Ababa on boarding we were moved again to my least preferred seats. Having spoken to their customer service people or more than one occasion and explaining to them we wanted a window seat, to be put in the middle two seats is not acceptable. The onboard team were pleasant enough. They may have a low price point but I won't fly with them again unless there is no realistic alternative.

### "express my heartfelt appreciation"
I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for the outstanding service provided by the cabin crews Netsanet and Selamaulif of Ethiopian Airlines. Their dedication and professionalism were truly remarkable. The experience exceeded my expectations. The service, efficiency, and overall experience were commendable. Upon my return to India, I informed the cabin crew about my fasting, and I was touched by their caring and attentive service.

### "Lovely meal"
Not Verified |   Feb 28 Addis to Windhoek.8.35. No need to get to Bole before 060.00. Quiet period for international departures. Nice breakfast in departures. No security check at gate, does ET trust Namibian bound folk? Max 737 but ok. Windhoek airport very small and quiet. Return to Addis from Cape Town March 13th. Superb 30 mins early., Boeing 787. Lovely meal. Addis arrivals very efficient. Only snag is Screens in these now 10yr old Boeing 787s, 2 of 3 in our row not working

### “my worst Business class ticket ever”
Bought my worst Business class ticket ever. Over the last 30 years flew with many airlines business class, mainly Lufthansa or British Airways (over 1 million airmiles combined with all airlines) This Boeing 777-200 was put in service around 2004 to 2006, nothing was refurbished. Dated seat cover. The seats control was not working, the TV screen over 2 meter away, need binoculars to read the text. Remote control 20 years old and dated can not read what the function means and so small, you need a microscope to find he buttons. The LED screen dated all colour lost and poor picture quality. On top when choosing a film only the advert came on was not able to watch a film. Asked to get moved, but further 2 seats where broken only one middle seat, which I declined. Food was low quality, service nice but not what you expect, asking to get a complaint form, NO, you can only fill in a customer review on the screen, which you can not read and they only ask how great they are. Quality of drinks, worst ever, juice concentrate stabilised with citric acid and lot of sugar, asked for sparkling mineral water, received a poor tasting soda water, Paid Euro 3000 for this experience, my verdict, will avoid to book again I paid 100% of the fare and received maybe 80% I paid, Over the last, I was so lucky, that I had the same experience on my RETURN flight, looks they only use this aircraft Brussels - Vienna - Addis Ababa.

### “zero customer service”
I was flying from CAI to JNB through ADD. 16th February 2024. As I arrived at the gate and was scanning my ticket to board the aircraft to JNB which was at 8:05 am, I noticed that I left my watch at the X-ray in ADD Terminal 2. I informed the ground agent and asked him that (I have to go back to get my watch as it is a branded original watch and it is not a cheap one that I can leave behind, at the same time I know which X-ray lane I was at so that won't take time) but he refused he was so careless and he just wanted to push me into the aircraft, so I spoke to his female colleague and she took my details to contact the security but she also was pushing me onboard. I boarded the aircraft, and nobody informed me anything, I spoke with the CM who was assisting with boarding she also seemed so sleepy and careless however she asked me to wait next to her as she would ask the ground agent to take me to the X-ray to get my watch as I shouldn't leave without the ground agent. when he came to the aircraft the CM asked him to assist me, but he shouted at me rudely and said (I will miss my flight and we are late) and all I needed to do is to go to the lost and found in JNB to assist me and he snapped at me in a very rude manner saying (easy isn't it?). The aircraft door was closed late around 8:50 so from 8:05 to 8:50 that was a very long time that I could have gone back to pick up my watch, so that was all a matter of rudeness and carelessness as even he should consider that it can be stolen, and I need to run back to grab it. Everyone cared only about pushing passengers onboard and closing the aircraft doors as we are objects, not humans. Honestly, zero customer service it is not a cargo flight it is a commercial flight where you deal with human beings, not parcels. When I arrived at JNB I reported to the lost and found for Ethiopian Airways as the ground agent in ADD, mentioned but they replied that they deal only with lost and found bags, however, they tried to assist by again taking my details. (and I’m sure the agent in ADD knew this information that they deal only with lost bags). Honestly speaking that was careless and rude and one of my worst experiences in any airline, I used to fly with your airline but never anymore. This story will go viral on social media as our lives and valuables should be your responsibility until our final destinations. And you should know that the competition is so high and offering a cheap ticket only is not what attracts passengers, what attracts passengers is good care and good customer service. As in my case, I saved one thousand rands to book for your airline over Egypt Air for example, but I lost a watch worth more than 10K. It would have been nice if he tried even if we couldn’t find it, but the attitude was terrible.

### “told we cannot board our flight”
Autistic son and I were told we cannot board our flight. On 31 January 2024, my son and I were travelling from Nanjing to Cape Town. Coincidentally, it was also 04th birthday and we were blissfully excited about our journey. Unfortunately, the experience soon turned into what could be described as a nightmare. As I had not opted to check in my luggage, Ethiopian Airlines had already emailed the boarding passes for my son and me. So upon arrival in Hong Kong, we were asked for the boarding passes and allowed to enter Terminal 1, go through all the checks and searches and eventually arrive early at the Ethiopian Airline boarding gate. I approached the counter and spoke with a male representative (I’ll call him Kay). He informed me that I was meant to collect my luggage and check in before entering Terminal 1 etc. He spoke kindly and said that although I wouldn’t be able to get the luggage at that point, I could continue my journey to South Africa and on arrival at Cape Town International Airport, I would need to go to the baggage claim office, explain the situation that the baggage was not collected in Hong Kong, show them my baggage passes and ask them to write a report which would be sent to Hong Kong airport and then arrangements could be made to have the luggage sent to Cape Town. I was very grateful that this employee was solution-driven and offered such kind service that would not impact me severely as a customer. He then printed our boarding passes and asked me to have a seat. About 30 minutes later, passengers were boarding the plane and my son and I stood up. Again, the male representative who had spoken with me earlier said that I should have a seat, which we did. This was the last time I engaged with this representative. After there were only a few passengers left we went to wait in line. During this time, I witnessed two other passengers who had flown from the USA with United Airlines, whose luggage had not been accounted for. They were asked to stay behind, as I was, but they were soon allowed to board the flight. When my son and I got to the front, we were told that there was a problem, but the airline representatives could not tell me what the problem was. At this point, my son was stimming, as those with ASD sometimes do in stressful situations. He was sitting on the floor repeating letters of the alphabet and opposite words. A different male representative (I’ll call him Ray), then stood staring at my son. I explained to him that my son is autistic and that he sometimes stims in that way, but not to worry as he would soon stop. The same representative who was staring said nothing in response and continued to stare. After some minutes, this person then approached me with our boarding passes in hand and said that it was not the airline’s problem that our luggage was not collected and that unfortunately we would not be allowed to board the flight. At first, I thought he was joking, because he had a smirk on his face and his tone was condescending. He said that I would need to cancel the flight with the agent and see if I could rebook the flight. I told him that I didn’t fully understand the reason and asked if he could explain this. He then asked for a moment and walked away without offering any explanation or customer-centred behaviour. He was cold and unwilling to even speak to my husband who was on the phone with me at the time trying to help me.

### “its a pretty decent product”
Family of 6 flying to Zanzibar for holiday. Ethiopian are (currently) our airline of choice for flying out of Stockholm to Africa. They have a daily overnight flight to Addis Ababa leaving at 9:50pm connecting with the rest of Africa which means that unlike the ME carriers you do not waste time flying too far east only to fly back. As three of our party of Star Alliance Gold we can bring the whole family to the lounges for free at all three points (Arlanda (7/10), Addis Ababa (5/10) and Zanzibar (3/10). We checked in at Star Alliance Gold and also managed to get advance boarding. This will all change for the worse when SAS leaves Star Alliance and goes for Flying Blue. Their App is well designed, clear, but maybe a tad slow to load but is probably most useful for retention of boarding passes. I recommend both their web based booking engine and check-in process. Biggest plus was on booking we were permitted to reserve all seats for the four legs on a basic economy ticket. This is a game changer when travelling in Africa (and Arlanda) when the differences of deplaning from as few as 10 rows can results in an hour difference in the queues for immigration. As for the flight its a pretty decent product. The aircraft are not the most modern. The FA service was professional including free unlimited drinks service and full food even on a 2.5 hour leg. Value for money wasn't bad considering we were flying around Christmas. Luggage allowance is super generous and checked lugagge arrived at its final destination on time.

### “the worst customer service”
Not Verified | This has been the worst experience I've had with Ethiopian. Remember that Ethiopian 5-10 years ago was a delightful company to fly with as the service provided was stellar and the logistical side of the business was fluid. Ethiopian Airlines has seen a major decline in the quality of the service it once provided. On my last flight, the air hostesses were mean and had a dirty attitude, I have been flying regularly since I was 10 years old; this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. When I got home from my flight I noticed that my suitcases had been severely damaged (They attempted to open my suitcase by ripping the zipper from the lock and broke both). When I contacted the airline by phone I was met with a very nasty voice and was not assisted. It's sad to see a company decline to such a state, safe to say I will never travel with Ethiopian if I can avoid it.

### "an absolute nightmare"
Flight was ok but had to transfer in Addis Ababa where we missed our flight because lay over was 35 minutes and then was rerouted via Dubai. Had to land at 2 am in Doha and then only happened at 9 am. Then had to go and find our luggage. Was an absolute nightmare. Have to fly back with them and dreading it. Will be our last with them.

### "disappointing overall experience"
Delayed both flights we were on, reprinted our boarding passes and made our kindergarten aged son to sit alone. Refused to pay for the delivery of three delayed suitcases (out of four) Minor aspects of the screens on board not working play a subordinate role but match the disappointing overall experience.

### "the worst flight experience"
Not Verified |  This was the worst flight experience I have ever had the displeasure of being a part of. We were late to board, then sat on the tarmac for more than an hour without AC, nor any excuse nor apology. The plane was dated, no screens for an international flight, little leg room, uncomfortable and limited space. We were late for our connection to Johannesburg, and had to run through the airport in Ethiopia, which was crowded, fought to get bins for the scanners, forced to take our shoes off (all for a transfer) When we landed in Jhb, only 1 of our bags showed up. The counters for baggage couldn't tell us where our bags were, as there systems were offline.

### "staff are gaining in confidence"
Not Verified |   Our return from Africa. There was some confusion at Maputo concerning departure time & destination. It appeared that ET had combined two flights, so we went to Addis via Blantyre. The aircraft was a B737max replacing the advertised 787, so chosen seats were changed & were less comfortable. We were about an hour late arriving into Addis which caused passenger with tight connections much concern, however there were staff there to assist them. Addis was relatively uncrowded at around midnight. The A350 to London seemed very full, & moderately on time. Nice beds in Biz and a near silence led to a good sleep. Skipped dinner but breakfast was good. Cabin staff are gaining in confidence, especially on long haul

### "I still haven't received a response"
I use the airline's services all the time, but there was nothing like this before. On September 14-15, I flew on a flight from Moscow to Goma. I had 2 bags of luggage. In Goma, one bag with the most important things, hygiene supplies was lost. After that, I made a complaint and a waited 2 days. A number of goods that I was carrying were damaged. This can be confirmed by witnesses. No one called me that my luggage was found, I had to call myself and go to the airport twice. The bag was also damaged externally. I estimate my expenses for this and moral damage at $400. The airline's support does not work and responds to me. I left a complaint on the airline's website in early October, but I still haven't received a response.

### "flight were extremely cold"
Horrible airline. The staff can't smile or friendly ask you what you want to drink. It starts with the check-in which is chaotic. They have 4 groups but don't even respect it themselves. On board, plenty of overhead room. The IFE has a very basic selection of movies and TV shows, and not the latest ones. Most annoying was the fact that every show/movie automatically has Chinese subtitles, even if you don't like it. Food is basic but okay. Always choice between chicken and beef/fish. Drinks are given like twice a flight and if you call an attendant it takes a 5-10 minutes before they even give you a bit of attention (and not the happy one). The flight were extremely cold and anyway, you have to give back the blanket 30' before landing. Also Bole airport is not the cleanest airport.

### "Nice flights, on time"
Not Verified |  Nice flights, on time and baggage got there too. The A350 is very good aircraft, smooth and quiet, ideal for a night flight. Biz was only half full. Catering was quite adequate but not exceptional, though the cheese board was good. Addis was slightly better than of late, and the biz security line was much appreciated. The 737 max second flight was totally full, but the biz seats large & comfortable. A good breakfast was served.

### "wasting my money and time"
Not Verified | Do not travel with this airline. They are terrible! This morning, I received an email informing me that my 11/26 flight is moved to 11/27. They do not offer ANYTHING to make up for THEIR MESS AND UNRELIABILITY. I have an Ivory Coast visa expiring on 11/26 which prevents me from overstaying on their territory. So basically, I am SCREWED. I have to cut my vacation short because of their nonsense. They are wasting my money and time! This is my first experience with this airline and I guarantee you this will be the last.

### “offered zero customer service”
We had two flights with Ethiopian Airways, 1. O’Hare to Addis Ababa and 2. Addis Ababa to Cape Town. Both flights we had a horrible experience. For the first flight the two of us initially purchased economy tickets but then upgraded to business class online for both passengers. At the check-in desk at O’Hare the workers informed us that 2 upgrades were placed under one name. They accused us of doing this and said our only options were for one of us to sit in economy or to pay the airport upgrade price, which was $500 more that what we paid for the online upgrade. After 20 minutes of arguing and speaking with a woman who identified herself as a supervisor, we surrendered and paid the airport upgrade fee so we did not miss our flight. Eventually I called and emailed Ethiopian Airlines and was refunded this. Why should customers have to fight for something we booked accurately AND paid for already? The online system couldn't have allowed me to do two upgrades on one person for one flight. It just is not possible. The second flight was the most jaw dropping events.....On 10/12 the plane flew from Cape Town from Addis Ababa relatively on time at around 1440. The captain announced overhead that we could not land because an aircraft on the runway had compromised the our ability to land (fuel or hydraulic fluid issue, which I learned several days later on my own). We flew around in circles for 45 minutes over Cape Town waiting for the runway to be cleared. The captain announced we would be landing in Cape Town shortly, workers were simply inspecting the runway to make sure conditions were optimal. Five minutes passed since the announcement and I noticed on the inflight 3D maps that the flight was rerouted heading north to Johannesburg. The captain did not inform us of this plan until 10 minutes after we were in route. How is this acceptable? What was supposed to be a 6 hour flight turned into TWO days of uncertainty, stress, no accommodations by Ethiopian Airways, and no guidance. Unexpected delays included; 45 minutes flying around Cape Town in attempts to land, a 120 minute unexpected flight to Johannesburg, 2.5hrs waiting on the plane in Johannesburg for a solution only to be told we needed to disembark, hours waiting to check into a hotel that was arranged by myself, TWO unplanned hotel nights in Johannesburg that were not compensated for, and a flight on 10/14 purchased by myself. Although this runway closure is not Ethiopian’s fault, the communication by Ethiopian was despicable. The were no instructions (hotel and future flight) or compensation given or even discussed. We were told we would be contacted via telephone for a future flight arrangement; however, two days later we heard nothing. In attempts to receive a departure flight out of Johannesburg, I called the customer service number 3 times; the evening of 10/12, the morning of 10/13, and the afternoon 10/13. On the morning of 10/13, I learned that the runway at CPT was open since it was noted on their social media. All customer service representatives said they had no information and we would be contacted. I gave up and purchased a flight to Cape Town with another airline. To this day and time we have not been contacted about a flight out of Johannesburg. Furthermore, while waiting on the plane for 2.5hrs in Johannesburg, the crew was far from apologetic and offered zero customer service.

### "I would not recommend"
Plane from Milan to Addis was overcrowded with excessive amounts of hand luggage. The aircraft itself has not been maintained on the inside, MY ifE screen not working, some toilet not operational. None of our 4 flights departed on time with the third being so late that they had to delay our connecting flight without any effort to make up the time in the air. I would not recommend using this airline.

### "overpriced for what you get"
Not Verified |  Worst flights ever. No ventilation above heads, we both came home unwell. Poor old movie with limited choice on small very old screens which my partners didn't work. Attendants didn't answer the call buttons and just switched them off. Food was awful. We flew from Ghana through Ethiopia and onto Singapore. Will never travel again as it is overpriced for what you get.

### "entertainment selection was dated"
The first flight was reasonable with adequate legroom even for my 6' 2" tall husband and the food was ok. The entertainment selection was very dated with no new films and very poor music selection. The second flight was on an older plane with minimum leg room so very cramped and no seatback entertainment at all. The return flights were both A350 planes and on the first leg, when my meal tray was put on my tray table it slid off as the hinge was broken along with the seatback entertainment screen. The passenger information announcements were very difficult to hear and understand as they were spoken too quickly.

### "Staff helpful as always"
Not Verified |  Superb flight London to Addis Ababa overnight. Left stand at Heathrow exactly on time arrived Addis exactly on time. A350 is brilliant. Staff helpful as always. Pre ordered meals delivered efficiently. Look forward to trying the new Gatwick to Addis route next time.

### "Very poor customer care"
Worst customer experience ever, first and definitely last time I'll use Ethiopian Airlines. Very poor customer care from hostesses, lost my baggage and even after providing all necessary details online, they only found 1 baggage. No delivery was provided and so I had to return to the airport at my own expense to pick up the luggage at a later date. I contacted them by email but I have not received any response or compensation whatsoever for the inconveniences and expenses this airline has caused me. Very disappointing and unprofessional.

### "Food wasn't impressive"
They lost my bag a week ago and still haven't found it. I travelled with an infant who I bought a seat for but wasn't given any package for her, (baby food, toiletries,). The cabin crew were unfriendly to me. I was suprised that they didn't offer things like socks, toothpaste in economy class. Their entertainment was very limited. Food wasn't impressive.

### "Flight was very pleasant"
Not Verified |  Flight was very pleasant and staff extremely professional. The call centre is very incompetent, a simple flight change takes up to 4 phone calls of 30 minutes each. They are rude and extra services and seat prepaid services like lounge, seat selections are not honoured with no refunds.

### "my luggage had not arrived"
Everything was fine until I arrived in Nairobi and my luggage had not arrived. Instead, it was sent to Mumbai and I had to wait to have it returned to me. No delivery was provided and so I had to return to the airport at my own expense to pick up the luggage at a later date. I contacted them by email but I have not received any response or compensation whatsoever for the inconveniences and expenses this airline has caused me.

### "upgraded seat which I never received"
1. I paid for an upgraded seat which I never received. 2. In addressing the air hostess and head management I was told “ we are full so sit down” 3. The television screen was broken and I was told it would be reset, 6 hrs later nothing ! And don’t ask for ear headsets because they seem to decide when and who can have. These are not handed freely! 4. The staff chose to ignore general passengers when they ask for anything and often reply “I’ll go look, or let me see“ and never come back or just avoid getting to you at all. 5. They rudely wake you up when serving anything and if you ask for anything additional they feel the need to blame you for not taking at the right time. 6. Staff were untidy I would think pride in what you do starts from appearance. 7. This airline needs serious intervention and Management needs guidance on handling staff and passengers. 8. To top it off, they must know they are a problem as at the end of the flight not one member of the crew was found at the door exiting and I came from the back of the plane so they had ample time to converse and say farewell to passengers as all other airlines do, I suppose they knew what passengers would say to them and chose to go elsewhere.

### "seat I had reserved was no longer available"
During my flight in July 2023, a delay occurred. The cabin crew assured us that the connecting flight would wait for Cape Town passengers and that ground staff had been informed. However, upon arriving at Addis airport, I found chaos with numerous delayed passengers and inadequate hotel accommodations arrangements. Furthermore, my in-transit luggage was missing for four hours, adding further inconvenience and the seat I had reserved was no longer available. I must highlight the unsatisfactory state of the toilets. One toilet was blocked, while another had accumulated years of sticky waste on the seat rim. Additionally, the cabin crew's uncooperative attitude in providing essential items for passengers, such as swallowing tablets or providing wipes for hand cleanliness, was concerning. Excessive noise from the kitchen area and lack of attention to passenger needs were also noticeable. I would acknowledge the contrasting experience provided in business class. I upgrade occasionally, or buy extra Shebamiles for upgrading or use Shebamiles. This is where passengers receive amenities like hot towels, menus, and recommendations regarding available choices. As a loyal customer who has flown with ET since 2011, I am disappointed to see the evident disparity in treatment between economy and business class passengers. It is disappointing when flights scheduled to arrive on a specific day are delayed, causing passengers to arrive a day later. This lack of consistency with the DBX-Addis-CT flights is worrying.

### "extremely disappointed"
I am extremely disappointed with Ethiopian Airlines and their staff. During my recent flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to Dubai, my friend and I checked in and received our boarding passes and luggage stickers. However, when we tried to load our luggage, we were told to go back to the line and check our tourist visa. We went to another counter to verify our visa with the agent name Meron Teklay (I appreciate her handling and she is well experienced) and then returned to the agent to drop off our bags, as we had our boarding passes and luggage stickers. Unfortunately, the agent was rude and refused to let us drop off our luggage, instructing us to go back to the line. It's frustrating that we completed all the necessary procedures but were still not allowed to proceed. I am aware that the Ethiopian government invested a significant amount of money in a smart checking system, but it seems like it is not being utilized effectively. I have personally traveled multiple times with a permanent residence permit for the United States of America and hold Silver Sheba miles status. This experience with Ethiopian Airlines on July 8, 2023, was the worst in terms of customer handling. I strongly believe that several Ethiopian Airlines travelers will share similar experiences and reviews very soon. I would like to bring attention to the supervisor on duty, Tewodros Assefa, on this date.

### "bad customer service"
My first time flying this airline, and definitely my last. Decent plane, decent business cabin, but bad customer service. Made to stand outside the plane with over 50 passengers eventually crammed into a bus and not knowing whether we could catch our connecting flights. Disappointed if this is the best Africa has.

### "changed my wife's flight to a day earlier"
Not Verified |  Ethiopian changed my wife's flight to a day earlier. They informed BudgetAir of their change. BudgetAir did changed the Ethiopian flights, but did not change the connection from Bangkok to Phnom Penh. On phoning Ethiopian Airlines I was informed that they had now made the change only to find that the call center agent did not follow through and the change was cancelled. Now we are being given the run around and it looks like my wife will have to spend over 24 hours at Bangkok airport. The airline's standard response is to tell you to contact someone else.

### "flight time is good"
Not Verified | The flight time is good. It leaves on time at 00:20 hrs in the morning and reaches Mumbai by 08: 00 am. Thereby passengers can have a good sleep after the dinner. The service is good except that the air hostess after dinner vanishes and arrives for cleaning up the leftovers just half an hour before landing and they do not have time to attend to passengers. Many passengers after waking up from sleep require a cup of water. It will be nice if an hour before landing the passengers are served with water.

### "A very enjoyable flight"
Not Verified |  This was the first time I used this airline and it was one of the best airlines I have flown with, staff very good and helpful, clean aircraft, and was on time there and back. A very enjoyable flight and will be using them again.

### "Boarding very efficient"
Not Verified |  Flew Addis Ababa to Heathrow 5.5.23 on Ethiopian's newest A350. Only been in operation 6 days. Boarding very efficient. Bole Airport very busy in the evening rush hour. Over 40 international departures in 3 hours. The enlarged T2 copes well with this number of passengers. Several restaurants and cafes all busy. Prices reasonable. Two double macciatos 8 dollars - have small dollar bills if in transit.

### "okay for what they charge"
First time using Ethiopian Airlines, check in at Heathrow T2 was pretty quick although the check-in agent failed to include my frequent flier status on the boarding pass which presented issues when trying to use the fast track & lounges, luckily I had a copy on my mobile. Used the SilverKris lounge which is good, boarding a bit disorganised but once onboard my seat 11A was comfortable enough. Flight departed on time for the 7 hour flight to Addis Ababa, service food (Dinner & Breakfast) and crew where okay. The PTV was also alright the seat not too bad, arriving Addis the transfer was straight forward and the airport itself wasn't too bad. I used the Cloud Nine Gold lounge which is a bit better than the general terminal, boarding the 2nd flight was again a bit of a mess. Another A350 and once again seat 11A however the seat had a fault so not too comfortable, crew where a bit vacant on this flight. The food a sandwich and lunch was again okay perhaps better than the first flight. Arrived CPT more or less on time after a flight of around 6 hours, bags delivered quickly so I suppose all in all Ethiopian got me from A to B & finally C without too much stress. I guess the one improvement would be the ground operation, it's pretty poor and rude at some points. I wouldn't use Ethiopian again but they are okay for what they charge.

### "Efficient, well organised"
Not Verified |  We fly with Ethiopian Airlines Domestic once a month. Addis to Bahir Dar, there are 25 flights per day to choose from. International 2 or 3 times a year. Efficient, well organised. A very pleasant experience.

### "Not what I expect in business class"
Not what I expect in business class. Booking process, transfer and food was horrible. Seat less than average 2-2-2 configuration seat had no storage possibilities. Service was average. Food had not the selection and quality of economy standard. The drink selection was limited and of low quality, especially the wine. Lounge in Addis Ababa is also useless and overcrowded.

### "the service was fantastic"
This was my very first time flying Ethiopian airlines and I was very pleased. From checkin at IAD to the layover location in Lome, I had no issues. I would like to thank everyone at Ethiopian airlines for a job well done. I travel to Ghana about twice a year and I usually fly United as its a direct flight, however Ethiopian Airlines to Lome and Lome to Ghana was not a bad option at all. From IAD to Lome was a little over 9 hours. It was a great value for my money and the service was fantastic. I have no complaints.

### "pretty terrible for business class"
Staff are always nice on Ethiopian and definitely the best part of the experience. Otherwise pretty terrible for business class. The seats were old and dirty, the entertainment system with limited selection. Food served to me was almost uniformly bad. New business class lounge in Addis Airport is overcrowded, hot and dirty. The food is also pretty unappetizing and at breakfast they had no working coffee machine. I fly this airline when I have no other choice.

### "I will not be flying ET again"
Flight from Nairobi to Addis was okay, albeit 40 minutes late landing after having to hold due to bad weather in Addis. Took ages to disembark in Addis as they parked at a remote stand and there seemed to be a shortage of passenger buses. Transit in Addis is always a shambles. Massive queues at the security checkpoint with multiple lanes unmanned and extremely slow screening. Boarding is always chaotic at Bole Airport, especially if the aircraft is at a remote stand and you have to be taken by bus to the aircraft. Took off an hour late for Khartoum and, after an interminable wait for baggage after landing, discovered that the airline had left more than half the passenger baggage in Addis so they could carry more cargo, as evidenced by the dozens of boxes that arrived on the luggage conveyor as compared to very few suitcases. Basically sitting in Khartoum with just the clothes on my back now with absolutely no idea when/if my luggage will actually get here. I will not be flying ET again.

### "incompetent and dismissive"
The airline staff is so incompetent and dismissive. Lacked an understanding of things and sounded like robots. I applied for a refund of a ticket I couldn’t use due to a family emergency and they didn’t refund it for more than 12 months. Then they turned around and told me that they won’t refund it before it has been more than 12 months. Their actions were criminal to me. I sent multiple emails even to their HQ to no avail.

### "I was absolutely satisfied with the service"
Not Verified |  Flew Ethiopian Airlines for the first time and I was absolutely satisfied with the service although Bole Intl Airport is chaotic in Addis. The onboard service and the flight attendants were amazing. From the moment you step on to the aircraft you feel at home with the generous Ethiopian hospitality the crew portrays. They kept feeding us throughout the 13hr flight to ADD and the food was delicious! All flights were pushed back on time and arrived ahead of the scheduled arrival time. I was very content and happy with this as my connection in ADD was just under 1.5hrs. However, if you are connecting through ADD then beware of the chaos at the airport due to the congestion. Expect heavy traffic at security with minimal direction from employees.

### "Very disappointing experience"
Flew Ethiopian from Mahe to Bangkok and back to Mahe, via Addis Ababa. This is not the first time I fly Ethiopian. Addis to Bangkok on an old 777-200LR. Used the lavatory on ground before take off, it was already dirty with a lot of paper tissues on the floor. The entertainment system was not working at my seat and my neighbour next to me. Service after take off was not friendly, only one crew had a smile on her face. One crew was not happy that she had to open a pack of passionfruit juice for me being in the last row that she overfilled the cup and handed it to me that the juice was leaking on my tray table and my neighbours. Had to ask a few times for a napkin to wipe the mess and she pretended not to hear. Finally handed the napkin without looking at me and no apology. And why is Ethiopian using plastic cutlery? On way back one of my checked bag did not arrive at my destination. I had perishables including meat products. Luggage arrived 24hrs later. Tried to file a claim for compensation but excuses given by the airline that they cannot accept the claim. Very disappointing experience. Tip: Fly with very low expectations and you will not be disappointed.

### "Eventually I did not board"
I had a round ticket booked from Tokyo to Seoul. My mistake was researching in time that I needed a special ETA for Korea. That's 100% my responsibility. I tried to rebook my departure flight but they only do so via the call centre. The first agent advised to book on their platform but not to proceed with payment as only the price difference to the old ticket would matter and call them again instead. hey do not send out a payment link. You're forced to give your credit card number over the phone - which is not very safe. Anyway my payment did not go through. So I had no other option than pay at the check in counter the next day. The price went up. The check in counter did communicate with customer service. Hence the price tripled in less than an hour. The person at the counter instead spent 30 minutes printing out all kind of airline policy to prove why passengers must pay XYZ fees. He could have spent this time trying to solve this issue by for example engaging with customer service and holding a price. Eventually I did not board. I cannot even recover my return flight as they are charging an additional $200 USD change fee.

### "Great planes, great staff"
Superb as always. We fly Ethiopian Airlines London to Addis at least twice a year. Would not dream of using another airline. Great planes, great staff. Flying time now not much over 7 hrs on A350.

### "bag looks like it was smashed"
I checked my bag at Libreville Airport (Leon Mba Airport). On arrival in Cape Town, my bag was a mess, they tampered with the lock and zip, luckily they couldn't open it. The bag looks like it was smashed against a hard surface, as the two legs were broken, beyond repair. I logged a complaint with Ethiopian Air when I landed in Cape Town on 14 December 2022. Since then I have made several enquiries regarding a replacement bag or some sort of compensation. No response whatsoever, just an acknowledgement of e-mail receipt. This is the worst airline when coming to customer care. My advise, when travelling using this airline, try not to take a large bag, that will exceed the maximum weight that you can take into the cabin. Avoid checking it in.

### "service has been utterly shocking"
From the minute I crossed the boarding gate to now I have had a terrible experience with Ethiopian Airlines. Firstly my flight in Oman was delayed by 40 minutes, this meant when I arrived in Ethiopia I had to run to catch my connecting flight. The Addis Ababa airport is an absolute nightmare - a bottle neck of thousands and thousands of people squeezing and pushing trying to all get through security. I nearly missed my flight to Johannesburg. When I get onto the plane I realise I did not have the same seat I booked - when I went through the gate where they scan your ticket I was given a different ticket by the person at the counter but I didn't think anything of it. This person did not even bother to tell me he was moving me from a front row aisle seat to a third row middle seat. When I asked the air hostess why my seat had been moved she said they had a VIP they had to give my seat to. I felt absolutely disrespected - like I did not matter - how could they just move me to a middle back seat without even speaking to me about it? The food on the flight was terrible - I could not even eat it - I had two bites because I was so hungry but left the rest. The food was so dry and tasteless, and really just not good at all. Both of the planes also had really weird smells on them. When I landed in South Africa (after being awake for 37 hours) I stood at the carousal for over an hour waiting for my bag but it did not come out. Thanks to my airtag I could see that my bag was still in Ethiopia. I was so exhausted, dirty and so angry that I just burst into tears - the man at the EA counter did not know what to do with me. He assured me that I could go buy clothes and toiletries for $80 and I could just claim it back from Ethiopia Airlines. Although this was a huge inconvenience because I was leaving for Cape Town 2 days later, I felt better knowing they would fit the bill for the extra things I had to go buy. My bag only arrived 29 hours later and the lock on my bag was also broken. I submitted my claim two and a half months ago and have still not received my reimbursement or any feedback from them. I have sent so many emails following up on my reimbursement and I have had no response. I have also filled out an online form on their website and have sent a message to their Facebook page. I have sent hundreds of emails but they just ignore me. Their service has been utterly shocking every step of the way - this is definitely not Africa's best airline. I will never fly with them again.

### "A truly wonderful experience"
A truly wonderful experience, from punctuality, amazing food to warm smiles. I would recommend Ethiopian airlines over and over again. I recently traveled with my wife and 2 kids from South Africa to Mumbai, on our return flight, we had a 15 hour stop over in Addis Ababa where Ethiopian Airlines offered us an accommodation voucher which booked us into their hotel for the night, this included meals and transport. I was truly impressed and touched as to how thoughtful this was. Thank you Ethiopian Airlines for accommodating us so well and for making our journey an unforgettable experience. Stay well, Fly well.

### "choose another airline"
We flew from Chicago to Nairobi and our suitcase was damaged with tears and a broken handle. They are refusing to take responsibility even though I showed someone at the Nairobi airport. I then called customer service when we returned to Chicago and was told to go to the O’Hare ticket counter. I did go to O’Hare with the damaged bag and spoke to the manager. He took all my information and said someone from the Nairobi office will be emailing me. It’s been 2 weeks and no one has contacted me. I have sent several emails and keep getting the run around. Also, my kids did not get children meals during our 2 flights to Nairobi. I had requested that over 6 months prior. Please choose another airline when flying to Africa!

### "layover hotel was disgusting"
The layover hotel was disgusting. Linen was dirty if the carpet a bit cleaner I would have slept there. Flight attendants were unhelpful and rude. My child was on crutches which were taken away from her even though she told them about Her bad stomach. Plane toilets hadn't been properly cleaned. Below average food, everything half broken, i could go on and on.=

### "I am very impressed"
From the start of my trip, till I arrived in the United Kingdom, I must say I am very impressed by Ethiopian Airlines. I had an over 12 hours layover and was checked into a very beautiful hotel (Skylight) with an airport shuttle and dinner and breakfast were provided. Their staff and air hostesses were very cordial. The flight was on time and the pilots were communicating with us during the flight duration. I must say the airline has improved a whole lot from the last time I flew with them in 2016! 5 Stars for Ethiopian Airlines!

### "Value for money"
A seriously underrated airline from Africa. The overall flight experience from Mumbai to Tel Aviv and back was uneventful. The quality of meals served was OK and the airline accommodates passengers in a three-star hotel when the layover is more than six hours. Value for money. Some room for improvement: cleanliness of toilets.

### "One of the worst airlines I have encountered"
One of the worst airlines I have encountered. My husband and I were supposed to take a trip from Chicago to Dubai connecting through Addis Ababa with Ethiopian airlines. We got to the airport well ahead of time, checked our baggage and got to the gate for our flight. We were told the flight was delayed but wasn't given any other information. We waited around for a few hours and were told to wait in the lounge. Waited again for a while, and my husband went to the airline counter only to find out the flight was cancelled due to some mechanical issue. We were told to go home and to come back the next day to be put on an 11am flight. We asked for our checked baggage back but Ethiopian airlines wouldn't give it back. We showed up to the airport the next day at 6am only to find out the mechanical issue was still going on and Ethiopian airlines didn't know when it would be fixed. They asked all the passengers to write down their email addresses on a piece of paper and that they would contact us when they had more information. At this point, we had already lost 2 days of our 10 day multi-city vacation. We went to United airlines (as our flight was a codeshare airline) and they managed to cancel our Ethiopian airlines ticket and were able to find us a last minute flight to Dubai. We went back to Ethiopian airlines to get our checked baggage back for the new flight and they refused to give the baggage as they claimed it had cleared security and they didn't have enough "manpower" to unload the luggage. Ethiopian airlines reassured us that that checked baggage would follow us to Dubai. We even let them know that we would only be in Dubai for another 3 days since we would be traveling to another destination after that, yet Ethiopian airlines assured us that our baggage would get to us. We got to Dubai and filed a baggage claim there. We waited for our baggage to arrive and even went back to Dubai airport only to find out the baggage was missing. We had to do a 14 day trip without our checked baggage and spend a good portion of our trip trying to buy a new suitcase, new clothes, etc. I'm very disappointed with Ethiopian Airlines.

### "screen wasn't working so for a 9 hour flight"
I checked in online for my flight and got my boarding pass well in advance of my flight but when I got to boarding gate they said my seat has been changed. I chose a aisle seat and got moved to a middle seat, not only that my screen wasn't working so for a 9 hour flight. My friend also got a whole glass of juice spilled on him. Horrible experience and I got no reason for my seat change and only got told sorry for the screen, pathetic. This will be both myself and friend's last trip with them.

### "will never used Ethiopian Airlines again"
This is the worst airline ever. My experience flying with Ethiopian Airlines was awful. From check in at Heathrow airport the staff were rude, service very slow. I had to pay for excess luggage, the agent at the ticket office counter seemed confused and she was very slow. Once we boarded, when dinner was served the only 2 options were either rice and fish or pasta and tomato sauce. As I am allergic to fish the only option for me was the pasta and tomato sauce. I asked for another meat option and I was told that chicken was " finished" . So I had to eat the pasta which was not well cooked with tomato sauce as I was hungry otherwise I wouldn't have eaten it. The airport upon landing in Addis Ababa was another experience, separate issue. I connected to Harare from Addis Ababa. Upon arrival in Harare I got 1 of my checked in bag and the other one was missing. The airport staff advised that it happens all the time "when the plane is full Ethiopian Airlines removes some random bags and they follow with the next flight". Shocking! So my bag was missing, there was no announcement from the crew that some bags has been left behind, no communication whatsoever. I don't live in Harare, I had to stay in Harare overnight so I could return to the airport the following day to check whether my missing bag was on the next day's flight. Fortunately my bag came on that day's flight, however there was still no communication from the airline or apology whatsoever after the inconvenience. Unfortunately I was on the same flight with a friend who also had a missing bag, she got her bag 6 days after arrival. She also doesn't live in Harare!! The inconvenience!! The worst airline ever!! I will never used Ethiopian Airlines again.

### "There truly has been a major decline"
I've flown Ethiopian Airlines as a business class passenger on multiple occasions. There truly has been a major decline on the quality of service provided to Cloud Nine passengers. Furthermore, there always seems to be some sort of delay with their flights. On my most recent trip, such delay caused me to miss my final connection (from Toronto to Phoenix) which resulted in me being stranded for over 14hrs. There was no apologies or any attempt from Ethiopian airlines to get me to my final destination sooner. Needless to say, I won't be flying Ethiopian Airlines again.

### "no words will describe how diabolical this service was"
What a complete rip-off. Abysmal customer service that stole my money. I booked this flight for my elderly parents and paid to upgrade their seats well in advance. I received confirmation of the seat booking and they debited the money from my account. When we went to check in online we noted that the seats had not been allocated as per the pre-payment. I went to see the Ethiopian Airlines office in person and met what can only be described as the worst customer service agent ever and I have met some awful ones before. Not only did she tell me that it was not paid for despite seeing the receipt and proof of the money leaving my account but then she told me it was not her problem and I should contact the helpline. I asked to see her manager and was told there was none. After getting very angry she went off and returned over 15 minutes later and said everything had been arranged and the seats were allocated. Imagine the shock my parents got when to check in and were given separate seats and not the pre-paid ones. This happened on both legs of the journey. What can you say, no words will describe how diabolical this service was. They are happy to take the money and happy to have customer service reps that lie to you and clearly check-in staff that are not qualified to do their jobs. If this is the state of the front office I shudder to think what is happening in the back!

### "I was very impressed"
Very pleasant flight with Ethiopian Airlines on Nov 28: Due to a very recent op, I required some assistance from the flight crew. They were very helpful and kind, I was very impressed. Flight was uneventful and comfortable, food was nice, all good! Addis airport for transfer from previous flight? Chaotic and seemingly rather disorganized. Luggage arrived fast in BKK, appreciated that!

### "The services was a disaster!"
Not Verified |  I had travelled with Ethiopian Airlines several times, always wishing that the same thing that happened to me before will change but it didn't. I travelled long distance with my kids and the 6 times I used Ethiopian the tablets on the seat were never working, a trip with a kid of 5 years old and a 1 year old is very hard, they also never gave any play kits for the kids. I asked many times and they just answered that they don't have any. The light on the top was also on all  trip, on my face for 16 hours and it wasn't working as well and of course they couldn't do anything about. The crew from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo and the other crew from Sao Paulo to Ethiopia were rude, answering in a bad mood, making faces between them and running and shouting at people, it was just terrible. I didn't travel with my husband so I expected some help from the crew but nothing happed, when they saw me carrying my baby and bags and my other daughter was scared, they didn't even try to help me. The services was a disaster!

### "told to stand at the counter and wait for 15 minutes"
Got a bunch of emails for upgrades, then couldn't finish my online check-in due to ‘system errors’. After the personal check-in was told to stand at the counter and wait for 15 minutes only to be asked why I am standing there, I can go and board the plane. And on top heavily damaged a brand new Samsonite luggage bag.

### "The staff were mostly distant during the flight"
This review only covers BKK to ADD Business Class was less than half full, not a high work load for the staff. Flight went sour for me 20 minutes into the flight, the Purser yelled at me for no reason, I was stunned. Claiming I jumped the queue to the bathroom (there was no queue). This has never happened to me, beats me what she was thinking, poor behaviour from a Purser! The staff were mostly "distant" during the flight (not just to me! ), but some were very friendly and nice. Food was nothing fantastic (beef was tough). During the entire flight, the Purser looked sour, luckily she was mostly working in eco. At arrival in Addis, chaos as eco passengers stormed forward and I missed the business class bus and my wheelchair assistance.

### "my suitcase was broken"
Customers care is horrible! I flew with Ethiopian to Paris. At arrival my suitcase was broken. I filed a complaint at the airport and the crew promised to send me a replacement suitcase. After 5 weeks waiting and trying to contact the customer service still nothing I will have to fly back without a suitcase and my one year old baby. Very bad service.

### "staff at Chennai must be polite with customers"
Not Verified | As per new rules they follow, passengers who traveling on Ethiopian Airlines must hold return ticket only with Ethiopian airlines to get boarding pass. Actually my return ticket was with Qatar Airways. If they follow the rules, should inform very earlier to passengers those who travel in Ethiopian Airlines. Ground staff at Chennai who are responsible to explain the reason why they denied to issue boarding pass must be polite with customers.

### "tried using credits the problems started"
Not Verified |  We had booked to fly in 2020 but had to cancel because of covid. We were given credits for 2 different flights. When I tried using these credits the problems started. Dealing with Ethiopian Reservations is a stressful exercise. Ringing is totally stressful. An agent answers and then I would start my explanation and they would cut me off. Emailing is slightly better but I would have to send the same information several times before I got anyone to do anything. Finally I booked our flights. Two weeks before we were due to fly they canceled one of the bookings and said we would have to change the dates. After much stress with emails and calls I finally sorted it out. We were told we could use our excess credit for an upgrade. But, when we tried to do this they refused. The flights were OK. Staff not so helpful or friendly. The food was disgusting and the mains were inedible.

### "no way to treat loyal customers"
Not Verified |  I have been flying regularly between Frankfurt and Addis for the last 3 years and I have silver status on the ET loyalty program Shebamiles. I used the possibility to upgrade from Economy to Business by submitting a bid a couple times. I worked quite well until today. I had received the email that my bid was accepted and that I had been upgraded around noon. Imagine my surprise when the unfriendly lady at the check-in counter could not find my booking. Apparently someone had booked a Business class ticket and I was back down to Economy. No email, no nothing, except for rude staff at the counters. Do not offer this upgrade possibility if you give away the seats anyway. This is no way to treat loyal customers and I will find different airlines for the future.

### "I would fly them again"
They were good not the best but a resounding B+ grade! The food was good! The tv did work, mostly, and the plane was clean. Air crew were competent. I have no real complaints. They were constantly sending me emails to upgrade my seat. On the whole I would fly them again.

### "last experience was so disappointing"
Not Verified | Lomé to New York JFK. I used to recommend that company, but my last experience with them was so disappointing. Like we say, as long as there's no issue, everything it's fine. As soon as you need them, you realize that they are not professional at all. They just want your money, they will assist you, call you to book your ticket, but as soon it's done, you're not longer their priority. I was flying from Douala to Lomé, then from Lomé to New York JFK (07/25/22), They lost my bag. And till today no bag, no news from them. I don't even remember how many times I tried to call them, it just rings, they don't pick up, it's like you calling a personal phone. Sometimes it's better to pay more for a better service, I can't recommend them anymore, and am going to keep posting negative reviews on social media to warn people against company like Ethiopian Airlines.

### "claimed my visa was not valid"
I was denied boarding by a gate agent in Cotonou. The agent could not read English and claimed my visa was not valid. Check-in staff later admitted that it was valid after I had been denied boarding and had missed my flight. Ground staff was unwilling to help and issue a new ticket. The call centre Ethiopian Airlines is thoroughly unhelpful as well. They either keep you waiting for hours or claim there is nothing they can do.

### "Overall I would recommend"
Not Verified |  The trip was nice and i think it was pretty good. The food was nice and it was good since you didn't exactly need premium food. there was a chocolate pudding, beef/fish/lamb stew, couscous with chickpeas or pasta, some biscuits and a drink. I thought it was pretty good and the flight had screens and the staff was very nice and kind. My only problem was that when we landed the Ethiopian and other people just pushed everyone out their way. I soon figured that out also in the Ethiopian airport the next day when we boarded our plane to the Seychelles. Overall I would recommend.

### "if I missed my flight its not their fault"
On our way from Addis Ababa en route to Toronto aircraft broke down at Dublin at 5:00AM and was grounded. Pilot announced aircraft had a Hydraulic Pump Failure and could not fly same Day since they needed spares. So we were taken into the Lounge Room at Dublin. We were kept in Lounge room for 11 hours without anything to eat, not even a cookie. There was no Ethiopian Airlines Staff present. I tried to go into the main airport area but I was stopped by Airport security, we were not allowed to leave the Lounge Room. So we just kept there from 5:00AM till 5:00PM when we were told there was another aircraft which came to take us. I had a connecting flight which was to depart at 1:50 PM but we arrived 7:00PM so I had missed the Flight. On the last aircraft I asked the Crew to avail me with internet and me willing to pay so I can email West Jet and let them know I wont be able to make it for my flight and the Crew Lady told me its for paying and I said I am paying then she said that I dont need to worry because many people are going to miss their flight so we are communicating with our Head Office so when you get to Toronto just go to our Desk and they will book you your connecting Flight. When I got to Toronto the Staff told me if I missed my flight its not their fault and I had to spend the night on a bench next to Ethiopian Airlines Desk at Toronto Airport, Then I found my own way to get home and there after raised my complaint to Ethiopian Airlines.

### "10 hours in Dubai airport"
They only let passengers know that the first flight from Abidjan to Addis Ababa was cancelled 4 hours after planned departure. After this, still no information about the rest of our journey for us passengers with connecting flights. Only the day after when a new flight from Abidjan to Addis Ababa was coming (24 hours after cancelled one), they informed me that they had changed my booking to fly over Dubai and then to Bahrain with flydubai. This will prolong my flight time with 29 hours, and I miss a full day at work. This itinerary appeared from my online booking but they did not give me any boarding pass or other kind of documentation. They just told me to deal with it in Dubai. Arriving in Dubai at 3am well in advance of my flight with flydubai scheduled for 7:15am, turns out that Ethiopian Airlines had not made any booking for me. The staff from flydubai tells me that their only chance to rebook me is the night flight at 17:00 thus I could look forward to 10 hours in Dubai airport. I run back to the gate where Ethiopian Airlines is boarding the flight back to Addis Ababa, there was a full queue of people waiting to board the flight back to Addis Ababa. I joined the end of the queue and waited until it got my turn. I kindly told one of the Ethiopian Airlines staff that once he had finished with boarding the passengers, I had a claim. They then left the gate, leaving me behind.

### "an unpleasant and long flight"
Ethiopian Airlines is a disappointing airline. The first flight should not have taken place in the plane we flew in. It was not maintained well. The roof boards were loose. The bathroom was duck taped together. The sink section came out of its socket and was open up. The plane should be taken in for proper maintenance. The food is terrible and I’m one who enjoys plane food. The chicken was rubbery and bland. I recommend bringing your own food. The staff barely offer you something to drink and when the staff were told about the damage they did not attend to it. The equipment on the plane is old and some lucky passengers were given earphones and a blanket, we had to request these items. The second flight was somehow worse. The flight was overbooked. The food was even worse than the first flight, inedible except the bread and cheese. The staff kept the cabin lights on throughout the night so it is impossible to sleep. I requested three times for the cabin lights to be turned off during the dark and I was ignored even though this was possible on the first flight. The seating is uncomfortable and small. This flight ran out of drinkable water. The movies were outdated and it was an unpleasant and long flight. If you travel far I recommend Qatar Airways, it’s more worth the money you pay. I have travelled on many flights with many airlines but I will never fly with Ethiopian Airlines again. I do hope the airline fixes these problems because I do wish the best for them in the future.

### "sleeping on the jump seats"
On my first flight from DXB to Addis, there was a delay due to the weather conditions in Addis. While this delay is beyond Ethiopian Airlines control, unfortunately, there was no prior information given to passengers in Dubai, despite a delay of 6 hours. The more severe issue was, that inflight, when I went to the bathroom at the rear of the aircraft, there were two flight attendants sleeping on the jump seats in the galley.

### "cabin crew were very friendly"
We have got a wonderful travel experience. In fact our Scandinavian airline(SAS) flight from Stavanger to Oslo) was cancelled due to pilots strike but luckily we managed to get to Oslo by another carrier and go ahead with Ethiopian Airlines on schedule. All our luggages were safely collected in Addis Ababa and back trip in Oslo. The cabin crew were very friendly and supportive. The airplanes are very clean and modern.

### "ruined my very expensive vacation"
Worst airline ever and I have never had such a horrific travel experience. My flight was delayed 7 hr at the start of my itinerary. I was never updated on the new departure time. I kept calling the global center (7x) and they would not verify the new departure time! My flight eventually left at 4am instead of 9pm but I missed all my connections and the start of my safari vacation. All my vacation plans had to be changed at last minute and this was extremely stressful. Then Ethiopian airlines lost my luggage for 7 days. No one from the airlines would help me. They kept saying they had no idea where the bag was even though I knew it was in Addis! The Ethiopian website is not helpful as it is not ever updated! No one contacted me so I had to spend my safari time following up. Finally after 5 days the airline said they would compensate me $100 for the lost bag…but no one at Ethiopian Global office nor in DC would assist me. I am not able to get the compensation! The airlines said they can not help me and I needed to speak with their offices in South Africa! This has been a nightmare experience ! Especially on a business class ticket. For my safari, I was without clothes for half the vacation. Now I Can not get compensation. Everyone I speak to at Ethiopian airlines is extremely rude. No one will let me speak to a manager, or assist me or say they are sorry. On my way home, I had to fight to sit in the Ethiopian lounge. They said I could not sit in the lounge for more than 3 hr and my layover was longer. When I checked on my luggage in Johannesburg , they told the lounge staff I did not have any bags checked in although I had bag tags to prove I had checked luggage - my bag was missing again. I had not yet left Johannesburg. Ethiopian airlines ruined my very expensive vacation and still won’t let me speak to any management about this trip! I can not get anyone to respond to my compensation!

### "No customer service"
Absolute horror airline to fly with. No customer service, you cannot speak to anyone in person, only by email, and they never helpful. Our luggage was lost on Day 1 of our travels, 26 June, and is still missing 4 weeks. It’s either in Addis Ababa or Frankfurt, they not sure! I bid on business class upgrades, which were declined, which is fine. But as we started the 2nd leg of our flight we get presented with business class tickets that we had not requested, but we now had to pay for.

### "unable to say where the bags are"
Had a very good flight to Bangkok and back with friendly hostesses and adequate food. When we landed in Cape Town from Bangkok non of our luggage arrived with us with no one able to say where it is or when it would arrive (25-30 passengers had the same problem on this flight). Had to spend lots of money on locksmiths and toiletries as all ours were in our travel luggage. Ethiopian Airways contact center is very difficult to reach, they keep you on hold for almost an hour then it just hangs up. After eventually making contact with the call center a day later they are unable to say where the bags are or if they even have the bags and that they will only offer compensation if they haven’t been able to locate the bags after 25 days. This means we have to buy new clothes and shoes as most of ours were in our luggage with absolutely no assurance or compensation from the airline. It seems like lost luggage is a regular problem on the airline with very poor communication or restorative measures I wouldn’t recommend using the airline

### "lack of friendliness at the check-in"
Not Verified |  I can only complain about the lack of friendliness at the check-in counter. I flew with Ethiopian Airlines 3 times over the past 6 months and that aspect has been a great disappointment time and again, and last time the check-in lady lost one of my boarding tickets. I asked her where the other ticket was. She assured me she'd given me both. I said I was sure she had only given me one. After insisting the problem was on her side she looked down on the floor, picked up the ticket and apologized and then enough smiled for the first time. They are some of my favourite crew on board but my word, at the check-in counter, it is something else...

### "everything that can be wrong"
The only good thing about this airline is that it got us from point A to point B without physical damage. You will find everything that can be wrong with a flight here. The stewardesses are more of a hindrance than a help, they look at you and speak badly, that's when they pay attention to you, they have zero vocation to help. I felt like I was sitting on a wooden board. I was sweating because the air conditioners don't work, the cleanliness is questionable, the headphones didn't work. All a headache. Spend a few pesos more but it's not worth the "cheap" prices you pay. They are stingy even for water. it was horrible. Lo único bueno de esta aerolínea es que nos llevó de punto A a punto B sin daños físicos. Todo lo que puede estar mal con un vuelo aquí lo vas a encontrar. Las azafatas son un estorbo más que una ayuda, te miran y hablan mal, eso es cuando te prestan atención, tienen cero vocación de ayuda. Sentí que venía sentada en una tabla de madera. Venía sudando porque los aires no funcionan, la limpieza es cuestionable, los audífonos no funcionaban. Un dolor de cabeza todo. Gástese unos pesos más pero no merece la pena los precios “baratos” que pagas. Son tacaños hasta para el agua. Fue horribleeee

### "Absolute horror trip!"
Absolute horror trip! No communication and no customer support. We flew to Frankfurt and our connecting flight to Hamburg was cancelled. We went on by train but our luggage went missing! No help from the airline and 3 weeks later still no luggage. All we get told is that they are still searching! Then we bid for an upgrade to business class. We got sent an email that we did not the upgrade, but as we step on the plane suddenly they billed us for business class by sending us an email while we are on the plane! How were we supposed to receive this email while we on the plane? When I said I don’t want the upgrade because the email from them said we were not successful in getting the upgrade, they replied that they had given our economy tickets away! And no one will help. Not with the luggage, they don’t even know where it is, nor about the miraculous upgrade. Don’t touch this airline. Their cheaper tickets have turned into the most expensive tickets!

### "One of her bags never arrived"
I needed to book for my mother-in-law urgently to travel with someone from Dubai to Johannesburg. One of her bags never arrived and we lodged a complaint, they promised to come back to us within 7 days and we waited, and until today (July 14, 2022) no response. I tried calling all the phone numbers they provided together with the ones I got from their website, but no answer or the phone number doesn't work. I sent them an email, but no response. If you lose your bag, there is no communication with them after the flight.

### "You definitely get what you are paying for"
Beware! If you buy a one-way ticket from this airline, they can refuse check-in at the airport counter on the grounds that you must have a return ticket also from Ethiopian Airlines. There is zero information about this when purchasing a one-way ticket on their website, I double-checked the whole policy wording and will definitely file a complaint with the local regulator. They just inform you about this ridiculous "rule" during check-in, and you will have to quickly book and pay a return ticket from your mobile. The ticket can be refunded later, yes, but with a refund fee - in my case, the fee was about EUR 500 for 3 persons. As for the flight itself, the food was terrible, and absolutely the same on both flight segments. The entertainment screen did not work in both cases. You definitely get what you are paying for.

### "Don't fall for the cheap prices, you will pay for it in other ways"
Not Verified |  I flew Ethiopian Airlines roundtrip from Toronto-Nairobi and back. In Kenya I bought another Ethiopian Airlines to Cairo - roundtrip. My experiences were horrible and despicable to say the least. First, on my return trip to Nairobi from Cairo, a big roach fell out of my food tray. I brought the attention of the cabin crew who took my boarding pass, took a picture and promised to file a report. Nothing happened! Then on my return flight to Toronto, I paid for a seat in premium economy for extra leg room. The money was charged to my credit card. When I got to the airport, they couldn't find my ticket and had to wait 2 hours for them to figure it out. They finally did and I was issued a boarding pass for the flight. In Addis Ababa, I presented my boarding pass and was told there is a seat change. I thought they were upgrading my seat due to the roach incident and the delay in Nairobi. Nope! They rather downgraded me and gave my seat to another passenger. When I protested I was threatened by a very unprofessional, rude and disrespectful agent at the counter. They threatened to unload my luggage from the plane if I do not take the downgraded seat assigned to me. Bottom line, Ethiopian Airlines in the absolute worst airline. Don't fall for the cheap prices, you will pay for it in other ways. Rude staff and poor service. Staff - cabin crew, ground staff etc, all need a lesson in customer service. Now I will try to see if they refund my upgrade fees.

### "my experience with Ethiopian Airlines was excellent"
Overall my experience with Ethiopian Airlines was excellent. The planes were modern and comfortable, the flight attendants were courteous and the food was pretty good. Great in-flight entertainment too. Price was a big factor in choosing them for my trip to London and back and as the cheapest option the value I received was exceptional. I would 100% fly them again and intend to next time I make a trip with them as one of the available carriers.

### "not welcoming, some were rude"
Check in went really well. When it was time to board though, the cabin crew were not welcoming, some were rude. I understand that people might not always be in a good mood, but they should also understand that we didn't do anything and all we're looking for is a safe and peaceful trip. When I got to my seat, the top cabin for Hand luggage was already filled by other passengers. I asked for assistance, but it wasn't well received by the crew. Imagine. I hope my next trip will be better than this experience.

### "would not hesitate to fly them again"
Check-in went smoothly and was opened 4 hours before the flight. Boarding was a relatively painless process and although masks were required a lot of passengers were not wearing them at the end of the flight. The aircraft was clean although some of the IFE screens stopped working (see picture) mid-flight. The meal was a lot more tasty than it looks – I opted for fish – but options had ran out for the passengers at the back and they were left with just pasta. I had a small bottles of euro wine which was probably undrinkable at ground level but was OK at 36,000 feet. We had fruit and a croissant for breakfast. Exiting the flight was slow largely because of the amount of hand baggage that was allowed. Overall it was good-value flight with some significant issues and the option of two 23kg bags for the basic economy price. I have flown Ethiopian several times – in both business and economy – and would not hesitate to do so again.

### "maintenance and cleanliness is a disgrace"
Although this is an 787, one of the newer aircrafts of Ethiopian airlines, the maintenance and the cleanliness is a disgrace. Service is OK, crew weren't enthusiastic, but at least got the job done. Seats are OK, considered it's 3x3x3. Many seats have malfunctioned entertainment systems. The meals were so so. The toilet is not kept clean and in a sorrowful state. All the windows on the left side of the plane failed to darken, causing passengers on that side suffering from too much glare form the sunlight, many had to use their pillow to block the window, which was funny to see. Lucky for me this is only a 2 hour flight. The plane touched down in HK airport very roughly with a loud thug and a huge bump, which startled and frightened all of us. For safety and hygiene reasons, I won't fly with them again.

### "We had to sit separately"
Not Verified |  This was the worst airline I have travelled long distance. Neither flight was I able to sit together with my partner (all together we had 4 flights). We had to sit separately. The seats were broken. The seats in the last row were absolutely ruined, full of springs, on the way back my seat was not fixed - I could remove seating area. I also could not lean back my seat so for 5 hours I needed to sit straight up, sitting between two strong men who took up even 1/4 of my space from each side - it was the same on 2 flights. The seating area is narrow, not comfortable. One plane did not have entertainment so they say we can watch it on our smart phones but it did not work. The food was not good, they ran out of white wine. Stewardesses were not as kind as other airlines. Overall I hope I would never fly with this company again.

### "helped us when we needed it most"
Not Verified |  My dad, sister, uncle and I are traveling to Harare and had a layover in Addis Ababa. We arrived at the airport just fine after a 12 hour flight and were in line to board our connecting flight when we realized we misplaced my sister’s passport. We were not able to board. Once we found her passport we were trying to book with the same flight the following day and the man at the customer service desk had an attitude as soon as he saw us and ignored us. He tried to charge us $300 each for switching the flight because he was clearly frustrated we missed it. Another staff went out of her way to check on us and confirm we found the passport. She then helped us get our flight switched without the ridiculous penalty fee that the rude customer employee was trying to charge for no reason. She is an amazing employee who helped us when we needed it most!

### "waiting for compensation for 4 months"
Milan to Accra via Addis Ababa. I have been waiting for compensation for 4 months and the status is always "pending airline approval". And it’s clear they won’t do anything about it.

### "I am still waiting for a refund"
4 months later and no refund. Do not use this airline. You can lose your money. They constantly change the date of your booked flights and even cancel your flight and rebook it without the passengers consent. They don't answer calls, emails or respond on their chatbot. They cancelled my flight without a reason so I requested a refund and they Charged me a Cancellation Fee and I am still waiting for a refund. Don't be tempted by their cheaper flight fees, its not worth it. Its stressful dealing with them with all the uncertainty of sudden changes.

### "My experience was not a pleasant one to say the least"
Not Verified |  I used the airline App to purchase a ticket one month before my travels from the United States to Ethiopia and was able to reserve a specific seat at the same time. I reserved seat 50L because of my high blood pressure condition. I needed to be seated away from any active passengers to ensure I would be able to have enough sleep which was necessary due to my medical condition. On the day of my travel to Ethiopia I went to check in and discovered my seat was changed from 50L to 13B which was next to children and was in the middle. I spoke with your ticketing agent at the airport who was not willing to assist me. I then spoke to a Manager who told me they are not selling seats but are selling tickets and that seat reservations made in advance didn’t really matter. I was almost crying because the airline staff were very rude and not willing to assist me at all. I feel they were calling me a liar telling me that I had not reserved seat 50L. Another passenger who overheard my conversation with your Manager gave me her seat which helped with my situation. Once I arrived in Ethiopia I went to the Addis Ababa office Which is the one in Addis Ababa to speak with someone concerning the negative experience I had with my seat reservation. Your staff member took my statement and I was told by her that I would receive an email containing the report your staff member had written. As of today, I have not received an email. I then asked her for assistance with my seat reservation for my return flight. She confirmed seat 50L was reserved for me and apologized for the negative experience I had on my flight to Ethiopia. Three days prior to my return flight back to the United States, I checked to confirm once again that I was seated in seat 50L. I then discovered that my seat reservation had been changed to seat 27B. I was really upset and when I contacted your airline I was told my seat had changed due to a change in the aircraft for the return flight. I asked why your airline does not send out an email when they change a passengers seat reservation, the agent on the phone for your airline told me that the best seat is always given to a Crew member. I was completely was shocked to hear that. I went to the Ethiopian Airlines office again to fix my seat reservation to what your agent had reserved for me. I spent three days of my vacation going from one office to another office to resolve my seat reservation problem as your App was giving me a system error. My negative experience with Ethiopia Airlines makes it less likely that I will use your airline for my travels to Ethiopia. I feel your management team needs additional training in customer service and your reservation system needs to be looked at so that your customers are alerted via email when their seat reservation has been changed. My experience with Ethiopia Airlines was not a pleasant one to say the least.

### "hostesses said there was nothing they could do"
Pity, because it had all started very well: modern, clean aircrafts, very good inflight service, competitive prices, but one can truly evaluate any company by the way they will handle a problem: Ethiopian is one of the few airlines offering to buy extra seats in order to enjoy extra space and I was very happy to be able to have the whole row for myself for as little as an extra 195 US dollars for a night flight, but once in the plane, the two, booked and paid for, seats were occupied by other passengers. The hostesses said there was nothing they could do, although they could have moved those persons to other empty seats or even upgrade me and simply said I should write to customer service. All my efforts have remained hopeless ever since. Never again

### "extremely bad customer service"
Not Verified |  It's such a shame because in December I had paid a fee to change my ticket and now I can't change it again apparently even If I offer to pay the change fee. All other airlines let passengers change their tickets a minimum of two times, but I guess you want to give out bad experiences to everyone who tries to book with you. It's unacceptable that you expected me to fly last year during a time when borders were not even fully operating and you would not even let me change the destination so that I could at least fly somewhere where COVID restrictions were better. You only gave me a voucher to use within 2021 as if we were not in the middle of a global pandemic. This specific ticket I had booked with 3 other friends of mine, everyone received a refund from their airline except me and I had been battling with this case for two years now. You should at least have a policy that allows you to change your ticket if it's of a significant amount, which mine was. This is just extremely bad customer service and it's definitely sad that this image is what represents this airline. Thanks for not helping and thanks for overcharging.

### "giving priority to its employees over passengers"
Having flown on Ethiopian Airlines number of times before I knew what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise to discover that the A350 had its latest business seats which were fairly standard although hiding the remote control in a cupboard did not seem to make much sense. As I arrived, despite only half the seats being occupied at that point, all of the overhead bins occupied and many of them were larger than the size the airline allows. I asked one of the cabin crew what was happening and she conceded – very apologetically – that all of the bags belonged to crew members. I managed to squeeze my bag next to an oversized pilots’ case. There seem to be at least five pilots occupying seats largely at the front of the business cabin which, of course, meant that they were served food and drink first. If Ethiopian Airlines wants to achieve reputation for being the best airline in Africa then it should try to emulate best practice and seemingly giving priority to its employees over passengers who had paid a significant amount of money to fly business class is not the best way of doing this. The cabin crew seemed embarrassed but clearly did not feel able to challenge their pilots. Other than this irritation the flight was smooth, the service efficient, the seats comfortable and both getting on and off the aircraft went smoothly.

### "cabin crew didn't help at all"
Travelling with twin babies and a toddler and the cabin crew didn't help at all with anything. We were last to get of the plane because of luggage and they just watched and didn't lend a hand at all for anything.

### "Service quite messy on some legs"
Brand new A350 but with old 2-2-2 C configuration. Clean and modern cabin, comfortable seat but with smaller pitch than older 777-200ER aircraft. Friendly crew. Service quite messy on some legs. Very poor catering (except good beverages): looks like Economy class food with bigger portions. A real shame to serve this to business class pax. First time I had to decline it. No traditional Ethiopian food like in the past on none of 4 legs. All flights on time. New business lounge in ADD very spacious with good amenities and food options.

### "refused to respond to my refund request"
I booked a flight and Ethiopian Airlines issued a ticket. After a day I heard from a friend that this airline was banned by Dubai from flying passengers from Uganda because they carried 9 passengers with expired Covid-19 results. I reached out to the airline and all they had to say is we don't have flights to Dubai. Why did they issue the tickets. Worst of all, on the flight date (17.10.2021) i received an email from the airline that the flight has operated a day before i received an email from their airport office that the flight will not operate. And they are unresponsive, they are giving different information and have refused to respond to my refund request if they cannot take me to Dubai.

### "Mytrip is not taking any responsibility"
I booked my return tickets from Johannesburg to Delhi via za.mytrip.com last year April for 2 people, reference number (L0JVZZ) , but flight got cancelled due to covid 19, I was given vouchers and was told that if I cancel my tickets after 1 year I would get full refund otherwise there will be a penalty deducted, I had to travel twice to India since that time but have not been able to use the vouchers as flights are still not operating. I have been asking for refund for long time, but za.mytrip.com refused to pay back now. It is so pathetic, feeling so frustrated and cheated. I am just trying to get my money back. It has been 18 months now. Extremely poor customer service by these two companies. Mytrip is not taking any responsibility or helping anymore.

### "I have never see a lazier group of flight attendants in my life"
I've flown Ethiopian Airlines a couple of times and have been generally satisfied. Not the best but better than many. I recently flew from ADD to IAD. This was a horrible flight. 1) A flight attendant was serving water in the cabin (nice since they confiscated all water bottles before boarding). I was seated in the back of a cabin. She ran out of water and never came back. Who cares? 2) The food and beverage service was absolutely the slowest I've ever seen in my life (out of about 100 trans-Atlantic flights). You would have had to work hard to go any slower. There were two flight attendants serving - and two standing around doing absolutely nothing. I have never see a lazier group of flight attendants in my life. 3) The food was worse than bad - inedible. The beef was nothing but grizzle and fat - I wouldn't serve this to my dog. No plan or organization for service - none. Terrible flight. Among the worst flights I've been on. The cabin crew was lazy beyond words. Avoid this airline if at all possible.

### "a terrific airline"
Fantastic journey. Flew on a Q400 turbo prop from Khartoum to Addis Ababa. They served a hot meal in economy on a turboprop 2 hr flight. From Addis Ababa to Kilimanjaro (with a stop without deplaning in Zanzibar) I also had great service in economy with a hot meal. The boarding procedure was very well organized and enforced (by boarding zone). The A350 from Addis Ababa to JRO had a great inflight entertainment selection. Ethiopian is a terrific airline.

### "Ethiopian staff are refusing to help book new flights"
My children are stuck in transit in Ethiopia as Ethiopian Airlines keeps delaying their next flight. They told the children that it’s because of weather but many planes are arriving and departing no worries so the weather excuse is obviously a lie. Now it’s over 12 hours! They have now missed their connecting flights and Ethiopian staff are refusing to help book new flights for them or pay for new connecting flights with the airline of the connecting flights which they missed. Disgusting. Did not even give the children a hotel to rest in even though they delayed the flight for over 12 hours.

### "Average to below average"
Not Verified |  Average to below average. Dirty, dated 767 on route. No entertainment. Low calibre staff. Check in chaotic with no queue management. Online check in never works. No counters for online/no check baggage. Food globular but edible.

### "Good in-flight service"
Due to cancellation of my KQ flight EBB-NBO-JNB, I booked a last minute seat on Ethiopian from EBB with a change in ADD. My travel agent booked this new flight in coach and I upgraded to business at airport. It was cumbersome with no agents on ground knowing what to do and finally having to speak on the phone with ET reservations. Took about 35 minutes. Ticket counter staff was courteous but clueless. I was the only business class passenger EBB-ADD. Equipment was an aging 777 with a tired interior. But seats quite comfortable and, in fact, I found the Ethiopian older business class seats far more comfortable than United's over-hyped Polaris service. Transit in ADD was fast and smooth. ET lounge was excellent, comfortable and very courteous service. There was a resting room and buffet of western and Ethiopian food. ADD-JNB flight was practically full both business and coach. A less-tired 777. Good in-flight service. Concerned that there was not a lot of mask wearing on flight and flight attendants made no attempt to enforce masking. Both flights on time. All in all, a very pleassnt surprise.

### "I am chasing them for a refund"
My flight for July 19th was cancelled by Ethiopian airlines, since 1 month now I am chasing them for a refund. Customer service is incompetent with basic spelling and huge English language understanding issues. If by some miracle you will get through 1h of waiting on hold to go through the customer service call you will face unbelievable issues where a simple task seems impossible to achieve and a refund status follow up is more difficult than a trip to Mars. I will never use this airline again.

### "can't fly due to the covid 19 restriction"
I reserved a ticket to fly to Geneva from Addis Ababa for June 20 and the ticket office provided to me a print ticket. On the flight day the airline told me as I can't fly due to the covid 19 restriction that those a British passport holder's not allow to fly to Schengen countries. I didn't know nothing, no one aware and informed me just I was blindly cheeked my covid test and ready to fly with a lot of plan. After that I asked to get refund but the answer I got the airlines very frustrated and an realistic with all their misinformation.

### "they have completely taken advantage of the pandemic"
Terrible Customer Service. Avoid at all costs. My daughter was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Madagascar, who intended to take a short trip home just prior to the pandemic. Just days before her scheduled flight, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a massive evacuation, therefore making her trip null and void. During the process, Ethiopian offered little to no support to my daughter while on the ground in Madagascar. Nevertheless she returned home. Upon her return, we spent the next year and a half trying to negotiate a refund for her flight. First the company offered a voucher good for one year (that we would not be able to use during the pandemic). Then, I sent a series of 7 emails to various company email addresses. I was able to get a response from a reservation representative, but when I provided the requested information, she never responded, despite assigning me a case reference number. This behavior is completely unacceptable, particularly due to the inability to travel beyond our control. We chose this company in good faith and they have completely taken advantage of the pandemic and a customer who has previously traveled with this airline. We will will use this company again.

### "ridiculous cheap airline"
Not Verified |  I just finished 4 flights from Vienna to Addis Ababa and then to Kenya and then the same for the return trip. On every flight, most of the screens were not working or not working properly. The staff were rude with the exception of the nice girls who were at the check-in counter in Vienna. The food was mediocre at best andseats are uncomfortable. I offered to pay for an upgrade on both the longer flights when I arrived at the airport and was told it was not possible despite there being availability. Just a ridiculous cheap airline.

### "such exemplary client care"
Not Verified |  My 85 (almost 86) year old mother was the passenger. I was just doing my best to see to it that my mom was all set, and I am astonished at how well she was treated! From Houston IAH I put my mom on a flight that stopped in Dulles. Over the phone, I was doing my best to help her manage her flight from Dulles airport to her final destination of Zambia Africa. It was nerve wracking, but the crew stepped up and managed everything with such kindness and gentleness toward my mom, that I wanted to say thank you to Ethiopian Airlines for such exemplary client care!

### "not possible to take the souvenirs on board"
We bought souvenirs (2 ebon giraffes) that we planned to transport as carry-on luggage, like we did many times before on our trips to Africa. We realise the items were slightly taller than carry-on limitations, but this was never a problem with other airlines in the past and other passengers had similar size souvenirs on board. At the check in counter, we were told that it is not possible to take the souvenirs on board and that we need to check them in. We told the employee that the items are very fragile and very expensive, he told us that the airline has separate containers for fragile items and that the souvenirs will not be damaged. We reluctantly agreed as we were not presented with any other options. On our arrival to Milan, we could immediately see that the package was handled with extreme negligence! The package was ripped od several places and it was obvious that the items inside were broken on multiple places. Now, they do not plan to make any effort to resolve the issue, even though the damage occurred solely because we followed their employee demands and assurances against our wishes.

### "I had enjoyable flights with Ethiopian"
Both flights were on time. The seats were in a 2-2-2 configuration, with no direct aisle access of window seats. Plenty of legroom but no privacy due to the rather old seating. Sufficient entertainment system with good amount of movies and music. No wifi at all on both flights because of the aircraft type (B787-8) Crew was helpful and courteous at all times. Food was average, probably because of the pandemic it was more like premium economy. All in all, i can say I had enjoyable flights with Ethiopian.

### "this was a near-perfect flight"
Given the circumstances this was a near-perfect flight. It was an A350 with the old-style side-by-side seating which, if there is nobody next to you, is probably better than the new seats. Having slept on both within several days the old seemed more comfortable than the new. Boarding was quick and painless and I was quickly served with a glass of (almost) chilled champagne. Topping it up is always a nice touch. The cabin was very clean and the surfaces had clearly been wiped. The temperature was perfect throughout – warm enough for a good sleep. I opted for the fish and although it was served on a tray, it was on a dish with metal cutlery. It would have been nice to see a printed menu but I could understand why. The cabin and flight crew were meticulous in following covid rules and the toilets were kept spotless. One of the advantages of covid flying in near-empty business sections – and therefore less chance of being near a heavy snorer. There were occasionally bumpy patches but, unlike some airlines, the pilots did not resort to switching on the seat belt sign every time or leaving it on too long. There was really nothing that one could fault with this flight and, for the price and the timing, it offered excellent value for money. The only change the airline should make is offer business passengers free wifi.

### "Food was OK but not memorable"
Having received an email from the airline telling me I had to arrive at the airport FOUR hours before the flight I then waited an hour before staff arrived. They hadn’t a clue why we had received the email. Business passengers go through a separate entrance which I suspect was slower than the normal route. Two pleasant immigration officers spent an inordinate amount of time checking my exit form. The lounge was empty when I arrived except for the Ethiopian crew gorging themselves. The lounge has PIR-activated lights which kept on switching themselves off if no movement was detected. Equally annoying were the continual announcements that the country had banned the use an import of plastic bags in order to “save the environment”. All very worthy. Boarding was relatively quick with the ground crew insisting that everyone wore a mask. Again very encouraging – except many passengers had half-removed them before they reached the aircraft including a returning pilot sitting in business. The aircraft was a little worn but adequate. I received a warm glass of champagne but had to ask for it. Food was OK but not memorable. As we approached Addis I obediently complied with the cabin crew’s request to put my seat upright – but the pilot sitting in business evidently believed that the rule did not apply to her and remained reclined during landing.

### "flight offered value for money"
Check-in at LHR was semi-chaotic with no distancing and a crush as passengers with huge amounts of baggage pushed their way through. There was no business priority lane. The only lounge open was Lufthansa’s uninspiring offering with beer or wine being served from a desk and a selection of food. Despite travel restrictions most LHR T2 travellers seemed to be retired couples. Boarding was slow with no priority for business but once on board it was a nice surprise to discover it had the new individualised seat layout. Cabin crew was quick to serve a glass of champagne and a refill. The movie selection was dire. Wi-Fi failed to connect to the satellite throughout the flight. The food choice was beef, chicken or fish and although it was served in a more premium economy style – a covid precaution – it was more than sufficient. The cabin crew was attentive in keeping my glass full. The flat bed was slightly narrow but not to extent that I was unable to sleep. Overall, this flight offered value for money and I arrived feeling relaxed.

### "cabin crew were efficient and pleasant"
It was a nice surprise to find a 787 rather than a 737 that they often use on this route. Although it had an old-style side-by-side business seats the front of the plane almost empty and so it was not an issue. A glass of champagne was served very promptly and refilled – a nice trick other airlines should learn. The choice of food was limited to chicken or beef and I chose the former which came covid-style but with a pleasant couscous and prawn. There is no Wi-Fi on the aircraft and I did not check the movies. The cabin crew were efficient and pleasant.

### "airline seems to do a very good job
Online check in through the app very good. Luggage drop off in Athens, was a biut chaotic as there were a lot of people with excessive luggage on the counter line. The agents were very good though. The 1st flight was delayed more than an hour, however as I had almost 5 hours stop-over in Addis Ababa, this was not a problem. The flight was coming from Moscow and the majority of the passengers were from Russia. Almost full, however no-one next to me. Comfortable aircraft and seat and good food service (hot tasty meal). Cabin crew wear traditional Ethiopian dresses, which looks very nice and they are polite and nice, although strict regarding the wearing of masks (which they should be). Addis Ababa is a big hub, very busy in the morning that we arrived (although during covid times). A lot of aircraft arrive at the same time and many passengers have to catch connecting flights, this was done efficiently though. The airport is not particularly luxurious or extra comfortable, however not bad either. Would have preferred a shorter connection, however I knew about it when I booked it. The 2nd flight was on time, uneventful, another nice warm meal in a 2 hour flight. Landing smooth and collected luggage pretty quickly. This airline seems to do a very good job, is the leader in African aviation and competes well all major carriers - seems that they directly compete the Gulf carriers on many routes pretty well.

### "they informed me a PCR was required"
I flew from Cape Town to Dubai via Ethiopia. The Dubai government website states a PCR test can be completed on arrival in Dubai. When I checked in at Cape Town airport Ethiopian airport staff did not request a covid test to board my first leg to Ethiopia. However I was denied boarding in Ethiopia as they informed me a PCR was required. I was forced to spend 2 days in Ethiopia waiting for a PCR test which was costly. I understand requirements need to be met but I’m deeply dissatisfied that the PCR wasn’t requested to board in Cape Town as the airline were well aware of my entire journey and end destination. When I raised the matter with the airline their only response was that it was mentioned on their website.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Not Verified |  We arrived at the airport well in advance, before 10:30hrs for a 13:40hrs flight. Their service was extremely slow; people started to pay agents working at the airport in order to jump the queues. They decided to stop accepting passengers very early. All the agents just disappeared and there was nobody to ask what was going on. The Airport Authority staff told us that this has been happening since Sunday 20/12/2020, and passengers are put on next day's flight, which makes them close early as all seats become occupied. With the Covid-19 certificate being valid for 72 hours only; everything becomes so complicated. We don't know what Ethiopian Airlines agents will say tomorrow, neither do we know what the staff at Ministry of Health will say about the Covid-19 certificate. Ethiopian Airlines need to stop this practice.

### "all money refunded to my credit card correctly"
We had 3 return flights booked and paid for in April. Due to Covid travel restrictions, asked for a refund via email. No response, so then a phone call to Australian office - told to phone head office in Africa. Emailed again and received reply with lots of exclamation marks saying 4-6 month processing time. Didn’t quite believe it was a genuine email, but 5 days later, all money refunded to my credit card correctly. Happily surprised, sad not to have been flying. Looking forward to a future African holiday.

### "I have now called them 24 times"
I had read the reviews from other travellers in regards to this outfit and against my better judgement went ahead and booked two return Business class flights due to depart 27th November. Due to Covid further restrictions and to bear in mind the political violence escalating in Ethiopia we were in no position to fly. I have now called them 24 times to speak to anyone on this and no one has answered a call - I have emailed - no reply. When we try to go cancel on the site - it crashes - looks very like a case of we have your money, you don't exist. So after much chasing around my only option is to see if my bank can step in on the payment. Worst airline I have come across in 15 years.

### "promised me to refund me within 10 days"
My flight was cancelled on September 10 and they promised me to refund me within 10 days. After 10 days they said 2 more weeks. Next it was 4 to 6 months. I wonder what they will tell me next.

### "haven't been able to get a refund"
I had a booking with in April when the pandemic struck us all. They cancelled my flight. According to European regulations the airline need to offer a refund. Ethiopian Airlines never offered a refund, no matter how many times. It's November and I still haven't been able to get a refund for my tickets.

### "My trip lasted a total of 21 hours"
I had booked my ticket from Nairobi to Athens via Addis Ababa and the airline cancelled my scheduled flight due to COVID. When the airline resumed flights and I went to change my ticket, I was informed that the price had gone up (to double in fact) and even though it was a ticket I had already paid for, I had to pay for it again. 24 hours before departure I tried to check in online, but only the first part of my flight was available for check in. When I arrived at the airport ET had cancelled my flight from Addis to Athens, without notifying me, and had also booked me to fly 24 hours later, meaning I had to spend a day in Addis and arrive to my destination with 36 hours delay. The only way for me to reach my destination on the day i had planned (which was important) was to fly via Rome, adding 9 hours to my trip, and a lot more risk of contracting COVID, as i had to wait for hours at the airport and later fly with a plane that for some reason was crowded in the front half, while the second half remained empty. My trip lasted a total of 21 hours, and cost 1100$. My husband flew a day later with Lufthansa, and was there 12 hours later, having paid 600$. when I complained about this and requested to be refunded the difference I paid, someone replied  'Please kindly note that whenever schedule change or routing change occur we understand as our passengers’ plan may be disrupted but sometimes such decisions are necessitated due to operational or unforeseen circumstances'. After having flown with this airline a few times, I have come to the conclusion that it's ok to fly with them if if everything goes smoothly, but if something goes wrong and you need assistance and customer service, they become the worst.

### "The aircraft was exceptionally clean"
Boarding was done efficiently – we were in zones and to prevent the inevitable attempts at queue-jumping staff were there to tell people to go to the back on the line. Masks were obligatory but social distancing was not. The aircraft was exceptionally clean and many of the seats in economy were empty – which is always a recipe for a pleasant flight. Toilets were clean. There was a broad selection of movies and the aircraft had decent screens. The only problem is that the controls are mounted in the arm rests which meant that occasionally the movie would freeze as your arms brushed against the panel. The flight was slightly delayed but arrived on time. Food was served promptly – a choice of beef or chicken with a roll, crackers, cheese and a biscuit. Although nothing special it was more than adequate. There was more wine if you asked. On landing at LHR there was the usual long walk at T2 and then delays at the eGates as passengers wondering why they were not working while they were wearing masks. The bags also took a long time to load onto the belt. Having flown on a 787 and then an A350 in quick succession, with identical seats, the latter would be my preferred aircraft: the flight seemed smoother and quieter and it simply felt better. Given the cheapness of the ticket this flight offered incredible value for money especially as it included one hour free wifi.

### "a more pleasant journey than in pre-lockdown days"
Heathrow Airport is operating in lockdown mode and therefore check-in and security were very quick. Most of the restaurants were closed, although it was possible to buy some drink and food to be eaten on the chairs. Boarding the aircraft was done efficiently and it was about half full which meant that I had three seats to spread across. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The food was served in a box with a choice of chicken or beef. There was no problem with asking for another small bottle of wine or beer. We left on time and arrived slightly early. The aircraft was wi-fi equipped with one hour free access and a modest fee after that. The connection was remarkably fast. Given the price of this flight it offered great value and, with the lack of passengers at the airport and on the plane, was arguably a more pleasant journey than in pre-lockdown days.

### "Forget Social Distancing"
Packed A359 from Dubai to Addis. Cabin temperature too warm, WiFI not working. Cabin crew very nice and attentive, meal was a typical C19 box with dry items and a hot casserole. Dry items were horrible, some small red beans salad in a sauce, bread hard as a rock. Crew apologized and brought a fresh bun. I guess ET assumes all their passengers like spicy food. Ethiopian proud itself on SAFE operation due C19, but on the ground they start boarding before the cabin is ready, so the jetway is packed, passengers on top of each other. Forget Social Distancing. Upon landing in Addis, passengers get up while the aircraft is still taxiing. Cabin crew tried to control the crowds, but to no avail. I forgot my BOSE headphones onboard,but trying to get assistance in the terminal was impossible. I was told “ to find an agent with a radio to call the plane”, but none had a radio. Our flight to Tel Aviv was delayed 3 hours du to some excuses about the ‘Air Space’ being closed in Ethiopia. That didn’t stop other flights to take off. Luckily we left after 3 hours (at 3am rather than 2355) Again that horrible box with spicy chicken, but we were all just happy to be out of Addis Ababa. Their cabin crew is the only good thing going for ET.

### "no hot towel served. No menu"
Frankfurt to Addis Abba on 05th July 2020. I had originally booked an economy class seat, but decided to upgrade to Cloud Nine as I wanted to relax and enjoy my flight in comfort.The check-in gentleman in Frankfurt was friendly and processed my $580 upgrade fee. No mention was made about any change in onboard service. I was directed to the Senator lounge at Frankfurt airport where I was horrified to find every single business class passenger flying that evening, attempting to squeeze in the few seats available. If the other lounges in Frankfurt are closed due to Covid-19, then having masses of people cramming into one lounge is a major mistake, as it puts a large number of people crammed together into one small lounge. Rather have several lounges open with a limited restriction on number of guests allowed at a time. Boarding went smoothly. The seat on the 787 was as expected. Comfortable, but unfortunately that is where the pleasant onboard experience ended. I realise that there may be concerns of the Covid-19 virus and how to handle on-board service, but I had just flown on a Lufthansa connecting flight from Lisbon, and i was given the full Business class experience as normal. Firstly, no hot towel served. No menu. Inflight entertainment not working. Seat charging ports not working. Economy class tray and food served in business class. Shocking quality of food for business class. Breakfast was cold and severed in a economy class tray and I found out it was the same meal offered in economy class! Toilet behind seat 5L, not flushing. Crew did not wear gloves at any time during service. How is Ethiopian Airlines charging me a full upgrade cost when the product I am receiving is not business class in any way. Only the seat was business class. Nothing was mentioned about the lack of service onboard this flight. They offer business class as a whole experience and product. I tried to call their global customer service number in Addis Abba and waited for over 6 hours on hold before the calls being cut off! They said they i was "Next in line" to be answered for over two hours! each time. It is wrong to use the Covid-19 threat to still charge business class fares but bring down the level and items served in this class. If you want to cut services offered then you should cut the cost of the business class fares to reflect this.

### "Africa's leading carrier"
Ethiopian is an all-around great airline that definitely deserves its status as Africa's leading carrier. For a two hour flight, we even got a full meal, something you'd never get in economy class in the US. They also had a nice cabin with comfortable seats, and there was a new stream to your device entertainment system. However, it's a shame that such a great airline is saddled by such a terrible hub airport like Addis Ababa, which is currently undergoing a renovation that doesn't seem to have changed the problem of congestion and lack of jetbridges. Luckily, this flight departed in the afternoon, as Addis Ababa gets even crazier during the late night hub hours. Boarding was chaotic, which is the norm on Ethiopian, but the arrivals process at NBO was actually decent, as Ethiopian uses Kenya Airways' much more modern wing of the airport for arrivals. Anyways, great flight, but mediocre ground experience.

### "unfair with its refund policy"
I believe that Ethiopian airline has been very unfair with its refund policy during this corona virus pandemic period. It has advertised that a "full refund" will be issued to customers whose intended flight fell between March and June 2020. However, this refund will be in the form of a voucher. This means that the airline has tied up my travel funds and I have no other option but to travel with them when the airports open. The airline has stated that if I want a cash refund, a $300 penalty apply. The airline has refused to issue a cash refund without penalty as it was the airline that went ahead to cancel my flight. They have refused to offset the value of the existing ticket against repatriation costs and I have been backed into a corner where I have no other option but to wait till the airports open (hopefully my visa does not expire before then) and travel with Ethiopian air.

### "USD300 fee to refund of the ticket"
I had booked a ticket with Ethiopian Airlines, which got cancelled due to the extension of Covid-19 Flight Restrictions. I contacted the Airline customer support via email and was advised there would be a USD300 fee applied to the refund of the ticket. This is despite the "Free" refund condition advertised on the airline website during the online ticket booking process.

### "Brilliant service"
Not Verified |  Missing Suitcase - Positive Result. My Wife was in SA when the Lockdown was announced - Virgin summarily cancelled her return flight (am STILL waiting to hear from them re getting back here, even though she has been home for a month) To get back she bought a ticket with Ethiopian Airlines, via Addis Ababa. The flight was great, good service, excellent planes and staff and a pleasant flight all round. Down side was that her suitcase didn't arrive - it wasn't put onto the plane in Johannesburg. Having notified the powers that be at Heathrow - with NO success, I wrote to Ethiopian Airlines directly. Immediate response from the highest level and a string of follow up emails over the next couple of weeks, she received a call yesterday to say that her case was waiting at Heathrow. We went down to collect it immediately - as per normal at Johannesburg International, her wrapped suitcase had been opened, the stitching slit and her case rifled through. Fortunately the low life that got in there didn't find anything as he didn't unzip the top compartment. I have the utmost respect for the way in which Ethiopian Airlines assisted us with the return of the case. Brilliant service. In future we will certainly choose them above any of the larger carriers who don't understand the meaning of customer service.

### "Don't bother using trip.com"
Beijing to Addis Ababa. I booked a flight through trip.com. I was informed by trip.com that my flight was cancelled due to recent flight restrictions. I phoned trip.com and received the expected answer that my full ticket will be refunded to me, due to the airline cancelling the flight. . I received a email that a third of my ticket price will be taken for cancelation fees and I need to respond within 3 hours to accept this. Neither trip.com nor Ethiopian airlines provided me with a reason therefore. Don't bother using trip.com, book directly through the airline and save on the fees you will have to pay trip.com.

### "hey offered an open ticket"
Athens to Entebbe via Addis Ababa booked for April. They canceled the flight, and is refusing to refund. They offered an open ticket which does not meet our needs. They claimed that we are not eligible because of the non-Refundable status of the ticket.

### "airline was offering a travel voucher"
My son and his friend booked tickets to fly from Johannesburg to Chengdu (connecting on to Shenzhen) via Addis Ababa. The departure date was 02 April 2020. South Africa enforced a lockdown from 27 March to 16 April. China enforced a lockdown on 28 March 2020. Despite several attempts to contact the airline locally, we were unsuccessful. Finally after a long, expensive wait, we contacted the call centre in Ethiopia. We were informed that the flight had not been cancelled but as the airline was not allowed to land, there would be no flight. The airline was offering a travel voucher and cancellation with a refund was available with a cancellation fee of USD150 and a no show fee of USD50 with no refund. The difference in airfare would be payable when the voucher was to be used, if applicable. On 27 March we received email notifications for each leg of the flight that the flights were cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. While it is understandable that the airline would not want to lose money, Ethiopian Airlines are using coercion. Customers have no control over changed flight prices at the point of flying after COVID-19. So if one opted for the travel voucher, a customer may have to pay more for a ticket. Should one opt to cancel, the customer would have to pay USD150. The fair position would be to either refund the customer with no penalties, as it is not the customer’s fault, or to offer the voucher with an assurance that there will be no price difference to be paid later.

### "Every thing was alright"
Djibouti to Addis Ababa. Every thing was alright but only one type food was provided at the economy class. Considering the fasting months in Ethiopia orthodox Christian and vegan customers preferences only chicken sandwich is not enough option and this can’t reflect the flagship airline standards. I hope the management team will consider this. I wish you all best in this critical time of covid19 .

### "disappointed with ground service"
I was very disappointed with the ground service. The staff didn't have the correct information about my flight and that of my children. They marked our tickets as used and confirmed that our flight had reached the destinations when in fact we were all held back. I was in transit in Addis and the kids were held back in Bujumbura due to bad weather conditions instead of landing in Kigali as planned, I understand a flight not reaching its destination but I don't understand why the company chose to withhold this information especially from a parent or give me the wrong info altogether, I cannot tell you how much panic this misinformation caused. The ground staff acted like we the clients were bothering them every time we asked for information. I asked a lady if she could make a simple phone call to their office in Kigali or to immigration to at least confirm if their passports had been recorded in the system and I wasn't granted even that. Do better.

### "flights were very pleasant"
Buenos Aires to Manila via Addis Ababa. I was  expecting the worst, but I got surprised, as the flights were very pleasant, the staff was very nice. They gave us lots of food and things like blankets, toothbrush and paste, socks, eyes cover, and considering I've had longer flights with more expensive airlines that did not provide any of these, I found it very nice. The only thing to point out is that in my second flight the screens wouldn't work, I asked for help to one of the members of the crew but she never came back.

### "not had a response"
Cape Town to London via Addis Ababa. Ethiopian has nice new aircraft in the A350 and some of their cabin crew are lovely. However their pre/after service care that is appalling. Bumped off a flight from Cape Town to London because the previous days flight was overbooked - our flight was overbooked - they put an A350 (smaller seating config) on the route instead of the 777 as had technical issue. Despite having queued for 2.5 hours at check in and the a further four house at the ticket desk, we were whittled off to a hotel for the night and promised to be on the next days plane. Things happen and generally accepted it up to this point. Arrived at airport next day and only ticketed to Addis but promised when we get to Addis would get onward ticket there as they could not issue in CPT. Didn't not believe as need an aisle seat and so was apprehensive. Also informed $300 voucher only usable for a flight or could convert to $150 cash at Heathrow at the ticket desk upon arrival. Got to Addis no onward ticket and when squeezed on the flight told I had to have a middle seat -informed they would ask all passengers on boarding to see if someone would swap. I was fortunate that someone next to me would swap. Upon arrival at LHR went to ticket office and woman behind counter says we dont issue cash here you will need to call customer service - called customer service who said or you will need to email the London office to find our what to do. Emailed the London office and a number of other offices 4 times and not had a response.

### "insisted on opening window blinds"
Awasa to Addis Ababa. We were told to board the aircraft by foot which was normal. However, once inside the aircraft, there was no air conditioning circulation. We were stuck in that condition throughout taxi. It finally cool down to acceptable condition after the plane took off. Worst of all was when flight attendant insisted on opening the window blinds, which let in more sun and heat.

### "7 flights and fully satisfied"
Mekele to Khartoum via Addis Ababa. Total of 7 flights and fully satisfied. During a long trip around Ethiopia we flew Ethiopian 7 times, 6 times on domestic routes and once internationally. Five of those flights were between 40-50 minutes, and even so, we got a snack (pound cake) and a soft drink - if there is any time left you can even ask for a hot coffee. One flight was slightly late, the night before Timkat we were flying to Gondar and it seems that due to huge volume they changed our plane, so there was some confusion at the gate. Furthermore, once on board, there was a technical issue - all in all we were about 2 hrs late taking off, made up half an hour and arrived 1.5 hr late in Gondar. During the waiting time the crew served refreshing drinks and all was calm. The international flight was 1.5 hr long, to Sudan, and once on board the engines were off and there was no A/C, which, however, meant that some nervous passengers started harassing the crew insisting they get them complaint forms during take off! It was quite annoying and unnecessary because once the engines were on the temperature went down so much I needed my jacket. Anyway, some people just like to complain. Every time our bags made it to the airport, even when we had very, very short connections between two Ethiopian flights. During the flight from Lalibela, the plane was waiting for several people who lazily strolled the tarmac to the plane (both Ethiopians and tourists), while the rest of us nervously waited with our short connections in mind. However, at ADD, where we made connections, the second flight waited for us, so we ultimately made it to our final destination, our bags included. All in all, we could not be happier with our Ethiopian experience and wish them best of luck in their ambitious plans for the future.

### "struggling to get feedback"
Addis Ababa to Johannesburg, both my suit cases were destroyed and I have been struggling to get feedback about a claim or at least to tell me that they are not going to compensate me so that I can take it up with my travel insurance company. On the same flight they lost one of my bags. This at least they found and delivered to my residence with 3 broken wheels. I have phoned and emailed an only received one message which did not help in resolving the complaint. It is like they are deliberately ignoring my emails and hoping it will go away. The last flight was delayed in departing Beijing and as a result I missed the connecting flight.

### "Awful and untrustworthy"
Not Verified |  
Nairobi to London Heathrow via Addis Ababa. It was the first time I have flown with Ethiopian due to my BA flight being cancelled. The service overall was quite good however the after care service after I left my blazer on board was awful. Initially they communicated to me that they had my blazer, then every time I went to pick it up the office was closed or they would take too long to respond to my messages. In the end they clam my £400 blazer has disappeared from the London office during what they call a ‘cleaning audit’. Awful and untrustworthy with no offer to compensate or resolve!

### "Cabin staff were nice"
Athens to Addis Ababa. On this trip we had 8 flights and all were on time. Their Boeing 787 is a great experience, the cabin was good even though they have 2 business class configurations. The one with the rounded seat configuration is better because the seat becomes real flat-bed with plenty foot area, the rectangular seat configuration is not real flat and the leg area is much crowded. Amenities were good and drinks were great. Cabin staff were nice and efficient but they do not kneel to speak to you and sometimes you do not hear what they say. They do not provide pyjamas. Food was very good, but they serve only one serving and coffee and chocolate before arrival. IFE was good with selection of movies from various cultures. WiFi only on A350 aircraft.

### "plenty of space to stretch out"
Booking the flight was convenient and the cost was reasonable considering the time I got my ticket. I have no issue with the flight itself as there were plenty of space to actually stretch out as it wasn't a full flight. My issue is the partnership with Air Cote D'Voire, when I reserved my ticket, I wasn't told I will be needing another ticket for Air Cote D'Voire until I landed in Abidjan. Thankfully I had enough time between my flight. Due to language barrier, the staff that attended to me didnt tell me exactly what the issue was. When I was flying out from Lagos and pressed for time, first of all their Ethiopian airline staff came in late that Saturday morning, and I had to pay extra for an Air Cote D'Voire ticket so I dont miss trip to catch my connecting flight. I reported the issue and wrote plenty of emails and kept getting passed around and till today I got no refund for the new ticket I had to buy even after everyone agreed there was a mistake and I shouldn't have paid for a new ticket.

### "exceeded all our expectations"
Mahe to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. The courtesy extended and efficiency certainly exceeded all our expectations. At every point in our trip we were assisted and directed by friendly staff. In addition, we were given hotel vouchers for our Addis Ababa transfer (which we were not expecting) and the transport to and from the airport was effortless. The airline hostesses were friendly and helpful and the food was good. The flight to and from our destination enhanced our holiday experience. We would certainly choose Ethiopian airlines again should the occasion arise.

### "forced to take transit hotel"
Addis Ababa to Mombasa. Food was average. The immigration in the airport forced me to take their transit hotel for an additional US$100 instead of the hotel I booked personally. Ethiopian airlines won’t cover my transit accommodation since my inbound flight was Lufthansa. We got home safe despite being late. Flight attendants were friendly and good service.

### "service  friendly and efficient"
Muscat to Hargeisa via Addis Ababa on Ethiopian in Economy. MCT-ADD return on a 737, the other flights on a Bombardier Q400. All flights left and arrived on time. Cabins simple (no IFE) but functional with reasonably comfortable seats. All four flights were full. Yet the service was friendly and efficient with very decent Ethiopian food and ample drink offerings, including excellent Ethiopian beer and wine. I cannot confirm many of the earlier reviews on this page. All my recent flights with Ethiopian Airlines were good. I think some of their somewhat tainted reputation might stem from the appalling Addis airport facilities rather than from the airline.

### "Exceeded my expectations"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, airlines like Singapore Airlines only serve a drink, but on this flight I was given a  Turkey Ham sandwich with cheese and veg, a drink blanket and pillow and economy class amenity kit containing Socks, toothbrush and toothpaste. Flight was very smooth and landed early, crew was top notch and service is indescribable. Ground staff was great, flight attendant greeted me as I went in and was helpful. All in all, a pleasant flight. In flight entertainment was touchscreen and easy to use, very responsive and the variety of movies is close to Singapore Airlines or Japan Airlines standard. Exceeded my expectations and flying again to Nairobi via Addis soon, can’t wait to see Africa. This airline is world class and I highly recommend you to try it out

### "Will not fly again"
Johannesburg to Hong Kong via Addis Ababa. Despite the aircraft being fairly new, they are in well worn condition. The A350-900 from JNB to Addis was only 20 months old, however the seats were torn in some places and seats and carpets dirty. Ground crew not very knowledgeable, cabin crew not great, uniforms tatty, name tags dirty etc. Addis airport is a dog show. Comparable to a Lusaka bus station. Food on both flights was at best low quality. Movies are old and not much to choose from. Only worth taking an Ethiopian Airlines flight if it is very cheap. But be prepared to get what you paid for. Will not fly again, even if its cheap.

### "inability to think critically to fix/solve problems"
Not Verified |  Kigali to Tokyo via Addis Ababa. Terrible airline. I am often forced to fly Ethiopian as I work throughout Africa and there aren't choices for carriers. If anything (anything at all) goes slightly awry relative the original plans (flight delays, bad weather, ticket date change, upgrading), they are absolutely incompetent and unable to to provide any customer service. I've been re-booked on a different flight without notice, only finding out at the airport, and told to go back home. On other occasions, I've had to change the ticket, but had tremendous issues reaching their so-called "global call centre", which, despite being '24 hours' often seems to have no one working. Rescheduled/delayed flights often lead to missed connections on other Ethiopian planes, but those later flight-legs are not fixed by the airline, so you're left with a lot of trouble-shooting that you must attempt to do on your own via the '24 hour' call centre. I fly frequently (2-3x per month) for work, but aim to avoid Ethiopian whenever I can, as I know that they will mess something up every third time, and at that stage, it becomes a personal nightmare to fix. Oh, and not to mention that they often lose your luggage, even on business class, and won't deliver the lost luggage to your home once found. Finally, what worries me most is the inability to think critically to fix/solve problems. People within the company don't appear to have the latitude to fix issues that arise (if things don't go exactly as per protocol, then everything breaks down and no one takes initiative). It doesn't make me feel particularly safe when an airline's team members, including senior managers, don't appear to have the latitude to problem-solve in the case of unexpected circumstances.

### "totally unacceptable"
My husband booked an online ticket for me and our two daughters to travel from Libreville to Cape Town via Addis Ababa on the 3/11/2019. I was the first to come for the check-in at the Libreville international airport, and despite producing the ticket, the airline staff said they were unable to find my booking, only that of the children, like how could they lose the main traveler and keep the children? This resulted in a serious waste of time, as they dragged me from office to office, to have this fixed; a problem caused entirely by them! After rebooking my ticket, they then issued me boarding passes for Yaounde, which was not my final destination since I am going to Cape Town, this resulted in another 40-minutes wasted! Then they realise that they did not do the layover booking for us, and they once again had to do it over again. How bad can it get for a single mom travelling with two children? This situation is totally unacceptable for an airline that claims to be the best in Africa! I would never use this airline for travelling ever again! Travelling should be a pleasing experience, but it is never one with these guys.

### "The cabin staff were nice"
Maputo to Ouagadougou via Addis Ababa. The flight left nearly on time. The aircraft was clean. The cabin staff were nice but too few of them. They took a very long time to serve the in-flight meal. They only spoke a basic level of English. There is no individual entertainment system, only some tiny shared screens showing kids films. Some bathrooms were out of order, only one was working meaning a massive, permanent queue for the bathroom. Our flight was only 5hrs so bearable but I would not want to do a longer flight with this airline, or to travel with young children.

### "service reeks of incompetence"
Abuja to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. Ethiopian Airline is the worst airline in my life to use. Flight Attendants are extremely rude and ignore passengers. My experience was they behaved like they were forced to work. Customer service, especially for their local Abuja and Johannesburg offices, do not respond to phone call or emails. Been trying to change a ticket for days no response. Ethiopian website is very terribly user-unfriendly. I don't know if for the purpose of extorting passengers decided to block their manage bookings to prevent passengers from changing the bookings so you rely on their incompetent and ineffective local staff who won't respond to communication. I strongly recommend not to fly with them as their service reeks of incompetence. Kenyan Airways is much better in my opinion and Rwandan Airways is gaining traction.

### "my first and last time to fly with Ethiopian Airlines"
The airline did not tag my walker/wheelchair even though I repeatedly approached them after sitting in the airplane alerting them that they did not tag my bag which was at the entrance of the airplane in my departure point in Kenya. After noticing that the walker did not arrive to my holiday destination (Sudan), I alerted ET staff in the airport who kept telling me to come back tomorrow which I did over 5 days and receiving a lost luggage report to follow up. It has now been 10 days and I have left my intended holiday destination and returned home to Canada, I called the airline and they told me that I should follow up with the airline in Sudan. I was told their local office is the office in Sudan who will determine whether I will get compensated. Not only did I have to suffer for two weeks without this critical health and safety equipment, the airline completely ruined my vacation and due to their incompetence are asking me to call their Sudan office to "figure it out". This was my first and last time to fly with Ethiopian Airlines - not only is there no mechanism to track your luggage but also the onus is on you to find it.

### "delayed by at least 4 hours"
Chicago to Mahe via Addis Ababa. Sitting at Chicago airport next to the gate for ET 511. So far the flight is delayed by at least 4 hours (who knows how much longer it's going to be) and we were given zero updates. At this point it is impossible for us to make our connection and no other Ethiopian flights go there on that day. Asked both gate agents and Ethiopian call center to put us on a different flight and they will not. So far everyone in this company we've dealt with has been unhelpful or outright rude. Terrible company, will never fly Ethiopian airlines again.

### "inflight personnel were unfriendly verging on rude"
Flew from Bangkok to Addis. They're using 787s on this route now and it's the worst configuration on any 787 I've flown. The economy class seats were old seats that were uncomfortable/cramped with screens from the 1990s. The food was inedible. The inflight personnel were unfriendly verging on rude. We were deplaned by bus in Addis. The capper of any trip on Ethiopian is the transit in their brand new airport, which is an appalling shambles. The gold lounge is a joke - it was so crowded, there weren't enough seats for people. The bathrooms inside the lounge (and outside) were small and dirty. It looks like the whole airport doesn't have enough bathrooms. I fly a lot, so I'm a Star Alliance Gold traveller, usually in economy. Ethiopian Airlines is by far the worst airline for star alliance gold travellers to fly. Other airlines have much better perks, lounges, amenities for SA gold passengers. But it's cheap.

### "needs better standards in cabin maintenance"
My first time with Ethiopian Airlines after years with Qatar Airways: crew really nice, friendly, on both flights. Cabin maintenance: cabin, toilet cleanliness needs attention, broken seat cover on Seat 3C flight: ET 0735, MXP-ADD, being a night flight seats were not lie flat thus not comfortable, bit disappointing. Flight ADD-CPT, ET0847 day flight, had lie flat seats. Clean cabin. ADD transfer: not professionally organized, lot of space for improvement. Food: good choice, perhaps too many spiced dishes for international travelers. Ethiopian needs better standards in cabin maintenance, clean toilets. good value for money, perhaps the quickest, cheapest way between Italy and South Africa. Will again fly with them soon.

### "No customer service"
Bangkok to Seychelles via Addis Ababa. Mediocre airlines. Food mand staff mediocre. Poor customer service. My luggage was left on the tarmac in the rain and my bag and contents were soaked and the bag was scuffed black  when I picked it up at baggage claim. There was no one around to check the luggage tags. Tried to file a Complaint and they said I needed to complain at the baggage claim. I tried to respond that there was no one there and my message was returned undeliverable. No customer service. I would not travel Ethiopian Airlines again.

### "good crew, no complaints"
Very pleasant flight from Bangkok to Addis Ababa, good crew, no complaints. Not happy with the business class lounge Ethiopian uses in Bangkok though, Miracle lounge really is very basic and very old and very miserable. I decided not to stay there and used my personal Priority Pass membership to go to the Air France/KLM lounge, the lounge Ethiopian used to offer business class passengers. Another thing I thought was odd: Ethiopian wines are no longer available on board (nor in the lounge in Addis). I loved the Rift Valley Merlot, wonder why Ethiopian’s flag carrier no longer promotes domestic wines. Flight from Addis to Johannesburg was also good. Old 737 (possibly due to 737 Max issues), business class basic but the staff were great, extremely nice and friendly!

### "in desperate need of refurbishment"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Addis Ababa. Planes are new but are in desperate need of refurbishment inside (textiles are torn, many Things are broken). Cabin Crew barely speak English so no communication (and some should take care of their appearance, smelly, dirty finger nails). Ground handling in Addis is a complete disaster.

### "never been so stressed"
Cape Town to Chengdu via Addis Ababa. I have never been so stressed in any experience of flying. We were supposed to be arriving at Beijing at 7:00 pm in order to catch a flight for Wuhan at 11:00pm. However, Ethiopian Airlines delayed the flight two days before we are supposed to leave and as a result we can no longer catch the Chinese flight. I then have to speak to the airline and I was on the phone for 40 mins to sort it out. The call centre was helpful but they are incredibly slow. They would tell you to hold and literally disappear for 10 mins while you are holding. After that is sorted, today we are flying and I cannot check in one of the passengers I was travelling with. Remind you that my mother and i bought the ticket at exactly the same time and I checked both of us in online at exactly the same time--however, I cannot check my mother in. This lead to another 40 mins on the phone with their call centre to try to sort it out.

### "the food is not good"
It is hard to split the experience at Addis Ababa Airport from the airline, but I will try. The plane is pretty new, a 787 dreamliner, but looks like a 50 years old aircraft. The carpets are old, looking bad with holes and missing parts at connections. The staff are pretty polite, but we flew from Addis to Sao Paulo with a huge trash bag - transparent - at the staff seat and on landing they fill one bathroom with it. Ethiopian Airlines are the first airline with no pasta choice, just meat or chicken, the food is not good. There is no ice so the beverages and water are at room temperature. The entertainment is ok, not wonderful but they have. On the flight between Addis and Tel Aviv there is no individual screen.

### "deal with their customers better"
Not Verified |  Washington to Kilimanjaro via Addis Ababa. Upon arrival at the airport at 4:30 am, i was notified my connecting flight to Washington Dulles airport had been delayed 5 hours. this would make my connecting international flight to Africa impossible to make. The affiliate airline could not find an alternative on it or any other departure that would make my connection. I called Ethiopian airlines and they did not have any solution. the only resolution was to take the international flight at the same time the next date; however they indicated there were no seats available. My trip was to climb Kilimanjaro, and a 24 hour delay would not permit me to rendezvous with my group of climbers to make the trek. Since they could not offer me a solution that could possibly work, I asked for a refund of my ticket fare and the business class upgrade that i paid for extra. I was on the phone with Ethiopian and their domestic carrier United that day about 2.5 hours, after spending and hour and a half standing in front of the United agent who was not able to help me at all at the airport. I did get some sympathy from the Ethiopian agents but no resolution while on the phone, and they hung up on me twice. In a pickle, I purchased an alternative ticket leaving later that day on another airline (KLM) that would get me to my destination in time to meet my trek guides and other climbers. I notified the airline of my intention to do so, by phone, and then I had to depart to make my trip and the subsequent 28 hours of travel to Kilimanjaro airport. I noticed that I was still being notified of the flights that I was not taking by Ethiopian, but in an effort not to further ruin a lifelong ambition trip, and in consideration of the communication difficulty from my location, i determined I would fight that refund fight after returning. My assistant carried that torch for me during my trip, several times getting on the phone, holding for extreme periods, and then getting disconnected or receiving vague promises to look into it. Upon my return from Africa, we both followed up four more times, but despite getting an eventual promise to refund my tickets, nothing has yet showed up in either an email or a credit (three weeks later). I realize this is complicated by the participation of two airlines (United and Ethiopian) but I purchased my ticket through Ethiopian and United required me to go through them to resolve my dispute. So, i cannot rate Ethiopian on their actual flights, as I did not get to take one, but as for their website and customer service, the website is minimalistic and not up to current e-commerce standards, and the customer service is either over-burdened with issues, or their practice is to try to put customers on hold so long that they eventually give up on their complaint. I had heard good reports on Ethiopian from travelers flying regularly to Africa prior to this, and several of my companions were on the flight that I missed (they flew in to Washington the night before) and they had not complaints. If Ethiopian aims to be a professional world travel airline they need to be prepared to deal with their customers better.

### "cabin crew were attentive and professional"
The flight was punctual and pleasant. The cabin crew were attentive and professional. Our flight back from Lilongwe to London had a 16 hours stopover in Addis Ababa. Once we on-boarded in Lilongwe, a member of Ethiopian Airlines staff handed us a voucher for one night hotel, one meal and breakfast at Addis Ababa. Once at Addis Ababa International Airport, another member of Ethiopian Airlines provided us with a transit visa to leave the airport and spend the night at the hotel. Shuttles were waiting for us and the transfer to the hotel was quick and seamless. The hotel staff were helpful, nice and professional. Our 16 hours stopover ended up in a pleasant stay at Addis Ababa, all thanks to Ethiopian Airlines. We cannot recommend company more for your trips.

### "crews are very friendly"
London to Gaborone via Addis Ababa. This airline is the best. The crews are very friendly. Their meals are of high quality and if you need anything and tell them they come quickly. Their professionalism is second to none so I recommend this airline.

### "no charging system "
Addis Ababa to Gaborone via Victoria Falls. There is no charging system or entertainment on flight. I was shocked to realize that we had to land in Zimbabwe then proceed to Botswana. This information was never given to me or put on my ticket. The food was close to bad. I would not recommend this airline.

### "flight itself was great"
Kigali to Addis Ababa. The ground service for this flight was horrific. The lady at the desk was rude to me for no reason. It took forever to check in because of all my layovers. Everything had to be written by hand I don't know why  It was a nightmare and add the fact that you can't do online check-in. There is no efficiency whatsoever. The flight itself was great, the customer service was amazing. The seats were comfortable, no complaint about anything on the flight.

### "Ethiopian doesn’t seem to care"
As usual with Ethiopian: poor food, IFE that appears stuck 25 years ago, employees that barely speak English (so imagine languages other than Amharic and English). Airplanes might be new or recent but seem centuries old when inside. Flight from ASM to ADD was on an old B767-300 with overhead compartments not closing properly, and half the seats unfit for air travel (seats that do not recline, no belts). The fact that Ethiopian doesn’t seem to care is beyond understanding but Eritrean aviation authorities should check the aircrafts and ground them if they keep treating customers and safety like this. Transiting through Addis is a nightmare (airport stuck in time, few dining and drinking options, not enough seats within the transit area, smoking area that is disgusting, employees literaly force you to reach your gate even if your flight is in two hours and there is nothing around boarding gates). The fact that the airline is monopolistic on so many routes sure doesn’t help them improve their standards. Next time I travel to the Horn of Africa, I’m flying with Emirates, Turkish or Qatar.

### "I would not recommend"
Paris to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. The latest 787s are nice and modern, with responsive touchscreens and a service comparable to global standards. Early 787s and 777s  with dirty cabins and dysfunctional IFE. On the Paris to Addis and Addis to Cape Town legs, the screen was not responsive and often had to be rebooted. The aircraft looked very poorly maintained even though they were not that old (less than 10 years old). The cabin crew were nice overall but looked junior. They did not close all the overhead lockers on both flights, prompting a few passengers to do it themselves. I found the food  quite bad, a shame considering Ethiopia's culinary heritage. When you add this to the absolute mess found at Addis airport, arguably the worst in the world, I would not recommend ET, though you often have no choice when travelling across Africa. On the plus side, all flights were on time, but I found the airline way below global standards.

### "my impression was okay"
On March 16th I flew from Oslo to Stockholm on Ethiopian Airlines. For me this was a cheap chance to fly this large African airline. The evening flight was quite empty, and I was only one of few passengers on board. After its stop at Stockholm the flight would continue to Addis Abeba. The flight itself was quite uneventfull during its 45 minutes. I was handed out a drink from the cabin crew, and that was the only service provided. The seat was comfortable, but wasn't well maintained. The case of my PTV was hanging lose, so I wasn't able to use the on-off button, so I couldn't use the IFE at all. Also, the touch screen wasn't working. Overall my impression was okay, but I would not fly the airline again because the lack of maintenance on the seat.

### "experience absolutely dreadful"
On March 21st, my girlfriend and I went to buy tickets from Cairo to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian airlines website. The first time we went to buy a ticket the card was declined. We went back to try to buy the ticket again with the same card. This time it took us an hour just to fill out information as our names kept being changed, altered, distorted, and deleted. Eventually to find out, the date was changed too. When we went to pay for those tickets, the card was declined again. We went through the whole process again of names being changed and deleted and finally paid for those tickets with a different card. That transaction was declined as well. We contacted this exact email address for help that day and there was no response ever. 2 days later we received a confirmation that tickets had been bought. I had to cancel the order on the second credit card so that we would not be charged for two purchases. Why is a purchase being made from our credit cards after the website has reportedly declined our credit cards and ceased the transaction. On April 20th I look at the tickets and the tickets were issued for Jul 22nd and not April 22nd. I had spent 3 hours being sent from person to person on phone only to be charged an extra $170 to get our tickets changed to April 22nd on a flight with many open seats, as that is how much more they cost on April 20th rather than on March 21st when I initially bought the tickets, for a problem caused by the horrific user interface set up by Ethiopian airlines and their lack of customer support. This experience with Ethiopian airlines has been absolutely dreadful and by far the worst experience of them all. Ethiopian Airlines has provided terrible care for their customers and all I have been given is one email as their appears to be no person qualified to talk to and provide us the care that should be provided. I requested a full reimbursement on and emailed Ethiopian a total of 3 times, with no responses to any of the emails.

### "awarded no miles whatsoever"
Delhi to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. Service was attentive, probably helped by the fact that all 4 flights were near empty. However be warned, Ethiopian selectively awards frequent flyer miles in Business Class. They are part of an alliance which was the reason for choosing them in the first place, yet was awarded no miles whatsoever for this trip. The small print on their site does state it, however it didn't occur to me to check it at the time of booking. That's the first and last time they get my custom.

### "friendly and attentive staff"
Muscat to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian in Business Class. Outbound an old B737 with ancient cradle seats that made sleeping difficult on this night flight. Below standard Business Class product which was somewhat rescued by the very friendly and attentive staff and the excellent food. The return started with an annoyance: we arrived at the airport, again at night, only to learn that our return flight was canceled, reportedly because there were not enough passengers. It must have been a spontaneous decision by Ethiopian since the flight was still displayed on the departure screens. The ground staff was more than nonchalant: “We didn’t call or text you? Oh sorry. Come back tomorrow.” My wife almost lost her composure since we both had to work the next day. With the help of the terminal 1 station manager, we finally managed to be rerouted through Dubai and reached Muscat some six hours later than expected. Muscat to Dubai was on a new A350 with excellent full-flat seats and again excellent food and service. The following DXB-MCT was in economy since there were no seats free in business.

### "so happy and overjoyed"
Cape Town to Entebbe via Addis Ababa. Flying with Ethiopian airlines has been one of those best choices. Friends used to ask me why use ET when your in East Africa and going to another East African country or going to another place where you can easily connect. All l could say l like the service and it doesn't matter if l have to go all the way to Addis. This time coming from Cape Town we had only 10mins to connect and for the first time I was 100% sure I would get to Entebbe without my luggage. I don't know how they made it or how they did it we all had our bags and we couldn't believe it how fast they transferred our bags to the flight to Entebbe. We were so happy and overjoyed. Have never missed my luggage or neither have anything stolen . Thank you Ethiopian Airlines for the amazing service.

### "food was a pleasant surprise"
Bangkok to Hong Kong. I was on a 787 which was a continuation of a flight from Addis Ababa. Check in was not good. I was the first in line in the Star Gold line, and there were three open desks. But none of the staff appeared to be working. The one desk which was processing customers was dealing with someone who was clearly a difficult customer, and wouldn't be finished any time soon. Since I had only carry on luggage and had checked in online, I decided to skip the counter and verify my documents at the gate. No problem there. The plane was nearly empty--maybe 40 guests on a 787. We all got rows to ourselves. We boarded on time, but left a little bit late. The seats were worn out, this must have been one of the oldest 787s in the fleet. The entertainment system was also a bit beat up, but the selection of both international and African films was surprisingly good. The food was also a pleasant surprise, delivered quickly, tasty and hot. The inflight team had a way to go to live up to international standards. They seemed to be barely able to hide their contempt for their passengers, which seemed strange. But you could see where some of that was coming from, there appeared to be a training attendant who was constantly criticizing them, her face never broke from an angry scowl. I wouldn't not fly them again. But as long as there are other choices, I'd probably look elsewhere.

### "food service was poor"
Not Verified |  The flight from Washington to Addis Ababa on feb 28 was in general good as far as leaving on time, flight experience was excellent and entertainment was fair. In contrast food service was poor. I have flow Ethiopian from IAD to ADD numerous times and always raved and appreciated their food service. We were fed at least four times and always bragged about it. However, on this particular flight we were fed only twice. Had Ethiopian had this policy from the get go nobody would have complained, i guess they spoiled us. Ethiopian has grand ambitions of expanding, but as one expands small details get forgotten  like cutting food costs etc. I will fly ET again but if things get shrinked as one expands, I might have to think twice about flying with ET again

### "Was pleasantly surprised"
Vienna to Windhoek via Addis Ababa. Was pleasantly surprised. Aircraft was very clean and new. The food (booked vegetarian) was delicious. Service was very friendly and accommodating! Was a perfect flight for our trip to Namibia. DE: War positiv überrascht. Maschine war sehr sauber und neu. Das Essen (gebucht Vegetarisch) war lecker. Service war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend! War ein perfekter Flug für unseren Trip nach Namibia! !

### "Staff were very friendly"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Stockholm via Addis Ababa. A real pleasure to fly on an airline with new aircraft. Staff were very friendly and answered all questions with a smile. Only downside is Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, it is overcrowded, confusing and a really bad Business class lounge.

### "a world class airline"
Ethiopian airlines is a world class airline, comparable to Emirates. Plus, they’re half the price of Emirates. I recently flew ultra-long haul 23 hours each way from Bangkok to Buenos Aires and returning from Newark. Both flights had two stops for crew changes. Check in at Bangkok Airport seems disorganised and the location of the check in counters which are next to El Al means you are checking in next to armed security personnel which gives an uncomfortable feeling. My hopes went up when I visited the EVA Air lounge which was very good. Boarding was extremely disorganised, they shouted out business class passengers but I was blocked by other passengers from entering the gate. We had the older business class product which is similar to Turkish Airlines A330, but compressed into a smaller cabin. You had a choice of mimosa, champagne or orange juice on boarding, and the cabin was 50-75% full on all flights. After a late night departure, only three passengers chose to have dinner, so there was no excuse for slow service. Within an hour after takeoff, I had enjoyed a very good late night meal. They plate the food on board the aircraft and place individual elements on the tray table, rather than bringing it out on a tray. After which, I slept like a baby on their comfortable seat. A comfortable quilt is provided, business class quality, but the pillow is too small. Transfer in Addis Ababa is messy, but you manage to get through somehow. The cloud nine lounge is one of the most unique I have ever experienced, and instead of doing an ear-wrenching PA a lounge attendant walks around shouting different destinations which are ready for boarding. I felt this was acceptable as they didn’t want people missing their flights. I thoroughly enjoyed a six-course meal on the flight to São Paulo, including some local dishes. One thing they do right on Ethiopian is every chicken dish I’ve had has always been moist and not dried out. Great job on that! The crew were courteous and well-trained. They were more than willing to go the extra mile. There were Enough movies to keep me entertained for all flights. The return from Newark just proved to me they are better than Emirates. The flight was delayed due to weather and late arrival, so when they announced the delay I asked if I could wait in the business class lounge. The gate agent said she would pick us up and whisk us through when the flight was ready to board. Sure enough, 30 minutes later, the gate agent comes and sees me and whisks me and other business class passengers through a very crowded boarding area. The flight was delayed three hours due to de-icing and weather, and by the time we got to Addis Ababa, we literally had five minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave. No problem, they whisked all tight connections onto a bus and drove us straight to the plane, and I was literally the last passenger to board the plane. All these little details clearly make Ethiopian Airlines a world class airline. When I re-read their website, they define their cloud nine as “a mix between first and business class.” I can very clearly see elements in the soft product which accounts for first class service. The hard product is still business class, to be fair. I would have no hesitation in flying Ethiopian again at all.

### "I am so disappointed"
Not Verified |  Addis Ababa to Atlanta. The staff at Ethiopian airlines in Addis have the worst customer service I have experienced. I and my two friends reserved our seats almost two weeks prior to our flight.They gave my friend's window seat up to another passenger; and when she questioned the agents who were handling customer care, they said that they could not do anything for her. I am shocked how unprofessional the staff was. I and my two friends were also told by the same people that we can not get on the plane if we keep questioning them about her window seat. No apologies from anyone at all. I am so disappointed, and I will never fly Ethiopian airlines again.

### "confusion on arrival in Addis"
Frankfurt to Juba Via Addis Ababa. I am struggling to find a way to say anything positive about my experience with this airline. From the confusion on arrival in Addis as to where to take the next connection, got into the right terminal eventually, meeting unfriendly ground staff,  business lounge had no urinal, one basin toilet that did not have water, and luggage that did not arrive with me at destination.

### "performed well again"
Mombasa to Kuala Lumpur via Addis Ababa. Ethiopian performed well again, check in slow at origin, some hassle over stopover in ADD but resolved in the end, smooth flight to ADD, special passport line in ADD, check in for next flight in ADD very convenient, lounge adequate, special boarding zone and boarding bus for business class passengers, smooth flight, on time arrival, transit in Singapore nuisance again, all transit passengers get off and be security checked again. Baggage arrived in KUL as priority.

### "Had a very good experience"
Flew Kuala Lumpur to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. Had a very good experience with Ethiopian Airlines. Check in KUL very efficient, boarding smooth, transit in Singapore a hassle, why did transit passengers have to get off in the middle of the night to be security checked again? Flight very comfortable, arrived on time in ADD, transit lounge leave a lot to be desired, but boarding for connection very convenient with jetty and arrival on time in Nairobi. Bags arrived first as priority!

### "generally positive experience"
Madrid to Cape Town via Addis Ababa . Both flights were on time and cabin crew were friendly and helpful throughout. I chose Ethiopian based on routing and overall point to point travel time. I was a bit concerned, because my connecting time in Addis was just over one hour - tighter than I think I could do at any European airport. But Ethiopian managed this with flying colors! Not only that, the overall comfort level on the planes (787 and 777) was quite acceptable, better, I think, than what I would expect on an American carrier (though lower than on, say, Emirates). The aircraft inbound to Addis from Madrid wasn't as clean as it should have been (and the toilet paper ran out in one bathroom). The aircraft outbound from Addis was properly cleaned (probably they do that kind of servicing only in the home airport), though the food on that leg was substandard (worst dessert I've ever tasted, but I would consider that a small fault). I should note that the new terminal in Addis wasn't completely ready and it was literally impossible to get information on my connecting flight's departure gate from the monitors. In the end, I trusted my Madrid-printed boarding pass, which did the trick. Verdict: not top of the heap, but my first experience on Ethiopian was a generally positive experience. In fact, I've booked another trip from Europe to South Africa with them for later in the year.

### "good quality service"
Paris to Addis Ababa. Very good flight with good quality service. Poor amenity kit offered by Ethiopian but overall presentation very good for the price. Personnel very attentive, catering of good quality even if wine could be improve. Bigger concerned are concerning Addis Ababa airport very far from the quality you have on board! Lounge very far from any expectations of a 4 star airline!

### "definitely not recommend"
Addis Ababa to London Heathrow. Found the entire on-the-ground experience in Addis to be a nightmare. Four really lengthy queues: security to get into terminal, passport control, gate security and then, finally and most unnecessary, a huge queue to check your boarding pass and passport at the gate. This was being done (extremely slowly) by a single (sometimes two) Ethiopian Airlines employee while a selection of her colleagues just watched. Seats themselves are fine, and the inflight entertainment was decent - good screen and a reasonable selection to choose from. However, the food was atrocious, definitely the worst food i've ever had on a long-haul flight. Dinner was a "chicken" sandwich with a plain cous cous side dish. The "chicken" was some form of luncheon meat, with a pink colour and a horrible flavour. Breakfast was a bland hot dish of "sausage" and scrambled eggs with some foul tinned-style fruit (not fresh). The cabin crew were for the most part ok, but there was an incident with a child vomiting across the aisle from me. Despite me alerting the crew, all they did was provide the mother with napkins to clean up and made no effort to clean the vomit from the carpet and back of the seat themselves. As a result the cabin smelt like vomit for the rest of the flight. Would definitely not recommend - there are better options for this journey, even if it involves a layover.

### "Very child friendly"
Had a very pleasant experience on our flight from Frankfurt to Windhoek via Addis Ababa on the new A350-900 / B787-800. Check-in swift and friendly staff. Boarding easy. Very child friendly. (Traveled with a 2 and an 8 year old). Departed on time and arrived 30 min ahead of schedule in ADD with a 2 hour layover going to WDH. Their new planes have very pleasant seats with good legroom an are very comfortable. Excellent IFE with allot of movies of choice. Food was good. Friendly flight attendants. Will be using Ethiopian on my future trips.

### "What a mistake!"
Not Verified |  What a mistake! The flight to Cape Town was delayed from leaving Madrid as well as leaving Addis Ababa. We also had major delays heading back home and we even lost our connecting flight. Hundreds of passengers we realized were in the same position when we arrived at the Ethiopian Airline help desk, which only opened at 9.30am. This is definitely going to be the last time I book a flight through Ethiopian Airlines. I'd rather wait 5 hours in Dubai the next time I go to Cape Town, at least Emirates has never given us the same problem.

### "last trip much more pleasurable"
Travelled from FRA to KGL via ADD and BJM on 3-4 January 2019 on A350-900 for the first time – and 737 on the regional flights. Check-in in FRA was not easy, neither on line nor in Airport and I got a bad seat in the middle of a middle section 1 row away from the rear toilets – sat in 46 F. However, they granted me space of two seats as 1 passenger did not show up. Flight full and almost on time. In Addis, bus gating from remote stand took >50 Minutes to disembark the aircraft as they only provided disembarking from a single door in front. Furthermore, they provided only a single bus at a time for 300+ passengers. In FRA they failed to print out my second BP, this often happens with ET and is very annoying as one has to queue up again in Addis to get the second. In ADD, I went to Cloud Nine Lounge though I am at present ineligible without elite status and on economy ticket. However, the lounge reception were kind and let me in meanwhile they upgraded from economy to business for 15,000 miles for next leg to KGL over BJM. Cloud Nine Lounge was nice, X-mas decorations and only half full. The last trip became much more pleasurable and peaceful than the first one though on a much smaller, modest aircraft. Departure champagne given. Luggage arrived perfectly after having traveled 6 legs prior to final destination.

### "such poor service"
London to Johannesburg return via Addis return. I was unable to use the self check in service at home or at Heathrow Airport. It took 45 minutes to check in at Heathrow even though they were only two people ahead of me. They were there making enquiries about flights. I was allocated a middle seat next to the toilets, and I was sitting between two large men. The plane was over booked and some passengers sat with the flight attendants, they were very noisy and were chatting in loud voices with the attendants through out the journey. For the evening meal I was served a tiny roll with melted butter and a filling which was supposedly chicken and a cup of coffee. I was never asked to choose. I do not eat chicken or drink coffee. The flight attendants were not attentive and were very selective in the manner they treated passengers. I was not offered a blanket even though I asked for one several times. On my return I came via Addis on the 25th and arriving at Bole on the 26th of Nov at 5am. On arrival I noticed that I had left my residence card in Johannesburg when I tried to board the flight to London. The check in flight attendant ceased my passport, boarding pass and my baggage stickers. She left me seated at the departure lounge departure lounge until the plane had left. She did not explain what was to happen next but she refused to hand back any of my documents. After two hours she said I must go to the Interlink Desk down stairs and that she would meet me there. I waited for her at the Interlink desk and she never showed up, the staff were not aware of what was happening. They only came to know about my case late afternoon, even then no one could update me or tell me about what was happening. They Interlink staff said they had received my documents from check-in-attendant but they were not going to release my documents. I asked if I could fly back to Johannesburg to try and retrieve my missing document, but I was told I was not allowed to. I spent the day and half the at the airport being ignored. On the 26th late afternoon I was told I was booked on a flight back to Johannesburg. I asked about my luggage and was told the luggage 42kg had been sent to Johannesburg. The staff in Bole refused to hand over my passport but gave it to the flight attendants. When I arrived in Johannesburg I was escorted by two immigration staff off the flight. The immigration staff in Johannesburg handed me back my documents and let me go. I checked for my luggage at the Ethiopian desk, the staff there were not helpful they refused to note that my luggage was missing and advised me to check for it in Heathrow. I booked a direct flight with another airline and I tried to trace my luggage in Heathrow it had not arrived. I luggage remains missing, I have tried to make contact with Ethiopian Airlines in UK through the numbers provided on website and by writing emails to different offices both in UK and Addis both my emails and phone calls have not been answered. I have made several trips to Heathrow trying to make contact and I have been made aware that the desk is only open between 14.15 to 19.15. The phones listed are either in active or are not being answered. Its sad to note that a carrier as big as ET can provide such poor service.

### "it was a pleasant experience"
Harare to Washington via Addis Ababa. On checking in at HRE International airport I was discouraged when seeing that our boarding passes (we had checked in 24 hours before and secured family seating as we were traveling with an infant under 2 years) had been changed as a smaller aircraft was now being used. But a lovely lady went above and beyond to check is in with another seat next to us to allow for the extra room that family seating would have allowed. Wow this member of staff went above and beyond and started our journey on a good note. Our flight was long with an arduous stop in Zambia, Addis, then Dublin, but the staff were warm, friendly and went the extra mile. They were lovely and made the incredibly long flight manageable. The service was good. I think the food could always improve, but it was a pleasant experience. We actually arrived early in DC, which is always a plus. Thank you Ethiopian Airlines team.

### "had all types of problems"
Nairobi to Chicago via Addis Ababa. I had all types of problems from them changing the flight on me to them deleting my daughters name off their system to the flight attendant refusing us to board yet it was their mistake and I have an infant standing outside in the cold while everyone else boards. I booked my tickets and requested windows seats all through, when we boarded our flight to Chicago on our return, they say myself and my baby next to the toilet and couldn’t move us. I'm very very disappointed and I will never fly with them again.

### "such a drastic mistake"
Sao Paulo to Addis Ababa. I made an online checkin this airline. The boarding pass showed the flight was 5 hours late (7.10 instead of 2.10 am). Not having anywhere to go, I arrived at airport at midnight. I was told that the boarding pass was issued and that the flight was on time. No damage was done, but you wonder what kind of airline would make such a drastic mistake and not make any effort to correct it.

### "attitude is so unprofessional"
Newark to Addis Ababa. They cancelled my flight a day before the trip without notifying me and put me on a flight that was 2 days later. There was no communication regarding this. Luckily i Checked the flight status in the morning. I somehow managed to get the tickets moved to next day, this threw my plans of the trip off and not to mention the inconvenience it added for me with a 3 year old kid. I contacted to the Ethiopian customer service to tell them about the situation all they did was route me from one center to the other. I raised a ticket with them on their website. I did not get any response. I sent them a follow up email after 2 weeks , they did not get back, not even a simple apology. The attitude is so unprofessional. I'm surprised this is how they treat their customer.

### "did her job very professional"
Dubai to Kigali via Addis Ababa. I wasn’t expecting their service was one of the best airlines, it was exceptional and very accomodating. I have to give 5 star to one of the Cabin Crew,  she did her job very professional! I was surprised with her gesture, there was no meat food left so i refused to take the vegetable food,but after few minutes she came back giving me business class food just for me to eat. She was so kind!

### "staff were friendly and attentive"
Tokyo to Ouagadougou via Addis Ababa. When I booked my flights my expectations were quite low, especially compared to some Middle Eastern airlines. I have to say it was very satisfactory for the price I paid. The one area, however, that I would want them to improve is the food. The food was average to awful during the flights, especially the one during ADD to OUA and back was almost impossible to eat. It was fish with lots of cabbage with cabbage pickle. However, The rest was fairly fine. The newly renovated airport in Addis Ababa is partially opened adding extra seats and comfort. The staff were friendly and attentive. The cleanliness was acceptable too. On board entertainment could be better, but wasn't bad either. So, yes. Overall for Price value--Very good. With a better food, it would be excellent.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Kuala Lumpur - Singapore in Business Class with Ethiopian Airlines. Initially got seat 4L, but since that was for the pilot not on duty, I was then relocated to 1L. Comfort seat with good cabin crew service, even though less interaction. Food was inadequate for C class.

### "56 hrs layover had been added"
I booked ticket on 20 Sep from Singapore to Sao Paulo via Addis Ababa, departing and arriving on 24 Nov. Today (19 Nov) when I tried to select seat, to my horror I found that my ADD-GRU flight had been changed to 26 Nov. I could not believe that 56 hrs layover had been added without informing me. It would have meant losing money onward flights and hotel bookings, not to mention the horror of sleeping at the airport for 3 days. I called booking office and they told me that flight on 24th had been cancelled. Anyway, the staff was able to change the ticket to normal stop over. Still, It's absolutely unacceptable that the airline would change flight dates without informing passengers (I notice that the website was selling ticket for the cancelled flight as recently as last week).

### "Nobody knew anything"
Once in the air, the flight was pleasant. All the services before and after flight are very weak, operations and workflow are badly managed, staff are insufficiently trained and prepared. They show no initiative (except cabin crew in business as I later experienced). After I read some reviews on Skytrax, I should have seen it coming. So, if nothing goes wrong, you have the chance to have a very pleasant flight. When the slightest problems arise, you will suffer. Our original flight from Brussels to Maputo (via Vienna and Addis) was cancelled and had to fly from Paris instead. No transport was provided, nor alternative flights to Vienna where the flight ADD was still departing. Paris-Addis flight we were downgraded. Old 777 from Paris was not very comfortable, later had new B787-900 on way back to Brussels which is much better. Before the flight, customer service lines were useless. Nobody knew anything. Services in ADD airport are less than satisfactory. And I'm still waiting refund for the missed business class seat, no contact from the airlines or answer to my request.

### "delay due to a technical issue"
Frankfurt to Windhoek via Addis Ababa. Wouldnt recommend it. Planes are worn down even if new. Staff busy with making selfies instead of caring about customers during the flight. We had a delay due to a technical issue with the plane in Addis Ababa. Communication was poor at best, were waiting for 1,5hrs until boarding suddenly started. Airport in Addis Ababa feels like a 3rd world construction site.

### "acted like a low cost airline"
During my whole experience with Ethiopian Airlines I was mistreated, lied to, not enough compensated, flight cost was 800 EUR, and they acted like a low cost airline, showing no respect/costumer service and inefficiency. I had a flight going from Addis Ababa to Paris, guy on the counter told me there was a “change in aircraft” & issued me a “standby ticket” but told me there was nothing wrong & seat would be assigned at gate. My baggage was checked, I then proceeded to do security, and asked two more people, told me there was “nothing wrong”, I did the line, waited to hop on the plane, me together with other 5 were on standby. They told me the flight was full, if there was any seat they’d give it to me - they didn’t, instead, they gave it to the other guys that arrived later. I stayed there shocked, and waited & waited, they told me they were going to put me on plane to another city in Europe and then connect me to Paris and issued a ticket for me to go to Geneva - so after one very stressful hour, took me to the office so they’d re-issue a ticket for the next flight (which was in 24 hours) and give me an economic compensation at this point, information was never clear and all agents seemed unprepared. I arrived to the office to find out my “compensation” was 200 dollars for a mistake they did agent again acted rude. They issued me a boarding pass with assigned flight for the next day and gave me a paper to “cash in” the money in “any ticket office of Ethiopian Airlines” literal words from the agent. Next day I came to the Airport, to cash in my money - surprise, they “couldn’t cash money at airport” “they didn’t have dollars” “supervisor couldnt sign the release paper” were some of the various excuses they gave me. They told me to pick up the money at the Hilton Hotel in the city 30 min drive from the airport. I arrived at the hotel, and they didn't have dollars, so....they told me they were going to “try to get the money”. Told me to give them my number and they will call me with a “solution”. I went away, and at 3:50pm they called me to tell me they had the money, that I had until 5pm to get there (another 30-40 minute drive) and get it - rudeness again was present They told me I couldn’t get it at the airport, since no supervisor was available to give me the money, going to the hotel was mandatory. I picked up the ridiculous 200USD, and thought this was the final chapter of this bad Ethiopian movie. I get on the plane the next day at 11:30 pm Sunday (after spending one day in Addis) battling with Ethiopian Airlines, get on the plane, get seated on my seat and another woman with a baby and I had he same  seats assigned, and a very rude Ethiopian Airlines agent demanded I moved, since the woman had also this seat.

### "My experience was exceptional"
Not Verified |  Hesitant given complaints by other reviews on tardy departures. My experience was exceptional: On-time flight, great attention to detail, tasty food (nice coffee), and nice lounge (shared with Skyteam, although ET belongs to Star Alliance). Seat was not completely parallel to the floor, but acceptable even on a longer flight (and I'm 6'1"). I would definitely fly Ethiopian Airlines again.

### "Excellent choice"
Zanzibar to London via Addis Abbaba. Excellent choice recommended by our tour organiser. Probably the quickest route to Zanzibar from London. Business class service excellent and at a good price. A350-900 a very modern plane and felt it. Flat bed very welcome. Nice touch is a separate bus at Addis guaranteeing priority boarding. No hesitation in using them again.

### "claim on a damaged bag"
Diass to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. I have been following up with ET several times with regards to a claim on a damaged bag and unfortunately have been shoved from pillar to post with a no care attitude! All I wanted was for someone at ET was to give me legitimate up to date feedback on what was happening with this damaged bag claim. But since 21 Feb 2018 I have only received useless emails whereby staff have been pushing the responses to different departments with no luck. I even went as far as starting a fresh mail chain hoping this would get a different response but  no difference in customer support! Very disappointed and horrified that this is the standard that Ethiopian has claimed their name to...would just like this query to be resolved!

### "wouldn't recommend this airline"
Mombasa to Toronto with a 3hr layover in Addis Ababa. In MSA they didnt give me the second boarding pass from ADD to YYZ saying their system was down and I would get it in ADD. On arriving in ADD, I was directed to customer service who upon checking my passport and permanent residence card (PR) said that they need to verify with the embassy and i should have a seat as i wait. 45 minutes later (while the lady assisted all other passengers) I stood up to ask her what was going on. She then gave me back my documents without any explanation and asked me to proceed to the gate. At the gate I explained I didnt have a boarding pass and another lady asked me to seat so that she can process my documents. 2 hrs later,and after the call to board I stood up to ask them what was going on. The lady referred me to another person who then told me their system was down. After pleading that I would miss my flight I was given a boarding pass with a different seat number almost at the end. At first I sat patiently both times as I thought maybe something was wrong with my documents. Turns out it was their system all along and instead of communicating with me they were just indifferent to my plight. I wouldn't recommend this airline to any of my friends after what i went through. It was a very long journey and they made it more tiring

### "customer service the poorest"
Buenos Aires to Tel Aviv via Addis Ababa. The customer service was the poorest! First, they charged me $300 more than what it shoes on their app - when I called customer service I had to wait more than 40 minutes to get to a representative that hardly spoke English and told me to Email them. When I did, they responded more than a week later saying the currency exchange was wrong and I was charged in Argentinian pesos and not in the local Ethiopian currency. At some point, they stopped responding to my emails. When I got to Tel Aviv I found out that my belongings in the checked suitcase were broken. I took pictures and sent it to the airline support email, I could only send one picture at the time. Although I sent several Email, I did not get a single response. On the day of the flight, I had 19 hours connection stop in Ethiopia, according to their policy I was supposed to get a night in a hotel, at their expense, which I was supposed to get during the check-in. The lady at the kiosk in Tel Aviv was so rude and kept me waiting till the 15 minutes before boarding, saying I could have booked a later flight and avoid the wait, therefore I'm not entitled to an overnight stay on their expense. Needless to say that when I booked the flight there was no such option (to avoid the wait with a shorter connection). After waiting for her to contact the whole airport, and texting a couple of private friends that had nothing to do with my flight, she told me I have 15 minutes to get to the gate or I will lose my flight. At the gate, I spoke with the "supervisor" who told me I should speak to the airline rep in Ethiopia, when I get there. She also screamed at me, saying its my fault for not choosing shorter connection time, even though I explained to her that I was never given the option. The rep's desk in Ethiopia didn't help much as well, but at the very least they were nice enough to plain to me that the kiosk in Tel Aviv could put me on a later flight that same night and shorten my connection to 4.5 hours. They explained that "they should have done it" or at least offer me that option since that flight was almost empty. I had to spend 19 hours at the not-so-traveler friendly airport in Addis Ababa. My one and only, nightmare type experience with Ethiopian airlines came to an end as soon as I landed back in Buenos Aires. Will never recommend this company to anyone!

### "return flight  also cancelled"
Kilimanjaro to Mahe via Addis Ababa. Flight from Addis to Seychelles was cancelled by a phone call 25 hours before. Then the return flight was also cancelled! This time with no warning, no email. No Ethiopian staff at the airport. This is the first time that I have a flight cancelled. And it happened twice in 1 week,  with Ethiopian Airlines. So I won't fly again with them. The connection in Addis airport is terrible. Spent 11 hours there. So happy it won't happen again.

### "experience was awful"
We flew Ethiopian from Los Angeles to Dublin. They changed our departure date to two days later and did not email us to tell us about the change. We only found out the day we were supposed to fly by checking the details on a separate online site. I talked to three supervisors and was not able to get an earlier flight, a compensation, or a bump to business class. We nearly missed a wedding and lost money on pre-booked accommodation and buses. They just kept insisting that the system is supposed to send an email. They also did not give us our pre-requested vegetarian meal option. They only had meat and could not give me a main course. Finally they found one vegetarian left and split it between all the people who did not have their requested meal. She kept insisting that we were not on the list for requested meals. A boy was vomiting on the plane and the attendants did not come when we used the button to call them. Nor did they come later when I needed a customs form. My seat could not fully recline and my onboard entertainment system was broken. This whole experience was awful, I told the employees that if they could not do anything to help the situation, either by booking an earlier flight, providing partial or full compensation, or giving us some sort of bump for the lost time and money that we encountered due to their mistake, that I would never fly with them again and would never recommend them. They did nothing and here we are.

### "very unpleasant experience"
Addis Ababa to Cape Town. This airline should be called a low service airline. Any interaction with ground staff in Addis Ababa assuming you can speak to them is unpleasant. The staff at Addis Ababa airport speak in one word sentences and often bark instructions at people. 10 days ago I spent 3 and half hours in a queue for a hotel voucher. The staff were rude and unhelpful. When we arrived at the shabby hotel we were offered over cooked food. On my way back to Cape Town today I was forced to stay a night in another hotel. It was a very unpleasant experience bed bugs crawling all over my skin and no hot water to wash them off. I have been coming to Addis Ababa using Ethiopian Airline for thirteen years. It is still as unpleasant as it was thirteen years ago.

### "No proper communication"
My plane from Nairobi to Cairo got cancelled. Stayed at JKIA from 3pm to 3am. Had to complain alot before we could be taken to a hotel after a lot of cold and mosquito bites. Didn't help that I travelled with my daughter and young niece. Coming back from Cairo Egyptair was amazing and on time. Arrived at Addis at 4am. ET flight 304 was to leave by 11.45am. Got delayed to 2pm. Got changed to an earlier flight ET 302. To depart at 9:30am. This too got delayed to 12 pm then delayed again to 2pm. Then delayed again to 4pm. How ridiculous. Stayed at airport on this connecting flight for 12 hours straight. No proper communication on what was going on. Rude ground staff especially on boarding flight. Wish communication was more forth coming. No compensation on delayed flight. When I got my luggage in Nairobi it was damaged. Very disappointed. Will never use Ethiopian Airlines again. Very unprofessional service. Stop over at Addis did not help. Crowded airport. Nothing to do there. Few restaurants and duty free shops.

### "we do not have yellow cards"
Mumbai to Mahe via Addis Ababa. Our flight from Mumbai was delayed by 6 hours but there was no communication on this. As a result we missed our connection from Ethiopia and had to stay back in Ethiopia for a day. When we landed in Ethiopia from Mumbai our luggage was missing. It took them another 3 to 4 hours to find the luggage. I went myself into the storage rooms and looked for the luggage. Upon complaint of this there was no response from the ground staff. Next day when we went to catch our onward flight to Seychelles, we were told that we will be detained here as we do not have yellow cards. This was not asked from any other passengers as we all were on transit visa. Only when we threatened to call Indian Embassy and complain about this were we let go but not before we had to sign a document which had a 5000$ or something bond and said we are responsible if Seychelles decides to detain us.

### "lowest level of service possible"
I don't know where to start. The lowest level of service possible, the most ignorant, slow, unskilled and unprofessional staff I've ever seen, the oldest aircraft and amenities possible, the most arrogant, pretentious and unwelcoming employees. What a terrible image of Ethiopia and of your own culture they give to foreigners. They treat their clients with such disregard and nonchalance. And the pretension goes all the way to calling their airline: "The best in Africa. Really? How about the worst in Africa, or even the worst in the world. This airline should stop operating if they don't plan on changing their management.

### "my luggage was damaged"
Johannesburg to Riyadh via Addis Ababa. All my flights from beginning to end of my trip were delayed. At Addis Ababa Airport, staff lied about loading my luggage onto my flight. My luggage arrived in Johannesburg a day after I did and it was badly damaged. Ethiopian Airlines refused to do anything about it saying that according to their records my luggage arrived in good order, even though airport staff themselves wrote a comment and signed the delivery invoice acknowledging that my luggage was damaged.

### "missing onward connection"
Nairobi to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. Was booked on flight ET 303 which was supposed to depart at 11h35 in Nairobi but ended up departing at 20H10 resulting in myself missing an onward connection ET 849. I had to stand in a queue for more than 2 hours to get an allocation to the next flight to Johannesburg. There was no one manning the queue resulting in squabbles among frustrated passengers.

### "Service onboard fine"
Khartoum to Kigali via Addis Ababa on 16 Aug. 2018 on Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 737-700, respectively. Both flights delayed. Arrived in KRT 5 hours late (with Fydubai from DXB) due to closure of the airport. KRT airport had a crash and the lanes were blocked 4 hours in the morning. Had to accept No-Show and rebooking fee to ET just outside the airport. Had no visa but transit passed relatively smoothly with a lot of officers leading and attending me while retaining my passport. A humiliating experience but I know these things eventually works out well – just don’t be fuzzy. Ticket reissue went very fast, paid 100 USD cash. Both Boarding passes received in KRT which proved crucially necessary: flight became 45 Min. delayed. Bus-gatings from/to terminals throughout, very tiresome: I waited in KRT >30 Minutes with 80 passengers in a double-bus before it took-off to the aircraft 200 meters away. Transit in ADD was horrible due to hundreds of people waiting and blocking security check. Manage in last Minute to board an old 737-700 to Kigali. However, after boarding delayed >1 hour on tarmac due to “gas refuelling” discovered though the captains’ recalculation of amount needed. Service onboard were fine on both flights and could refill hot meals and drinks, inc. wine. Expensive ticket. Cannot recommend for unexperienced travellers.

### "The worst experience"
Blantyre to Dubai via Addis Ababa. The worst experience and the ordeal is not finished yet and I am still waiting at Addis Ababa to go to Dubai. The problem started when flight at Blantyre was delayed by 3 hours. The worst, the booking clerk issued boarding pass till Addis Ababa and told me to collect boarding pass of Dubai at Addis Ababa. I believed and it was my biggest mistake. Now I came to Addis Ababa and after continuous follow up with the person concern i could not get boarding pass. They asked me to wait for some time and checked 80% passenger and then declared flight is full and next flight is in morning. It is to be noted that my flight was at 9.35 pm from Addis Ababa which got delayed to 1 am and after it was declared full, next flight announced was at 10.00 am in morning. There were around 25 passenger stranded without their fault in fact it was fault of Ethiopian airlines. After a lot of fight, struggle and waiting at 3 am new ticket is issued and we are left at low class lounge at our mercy to wait till 9.45 pm - promised to provide hotel but it is certain no such facility will be given because there are more than 500 people stranded for different flight because of overbooking and nobody is there to console or give appropriate reply.

### "experience was pretty average"
Addis Ababa to Mumbai. We were sitting in row number 32 of the economy class. The air conditioning was poor and through out the duration of the flight (more than 5 hrs) we were uncomfortable due to poor cooling. We had informed the flight attendant about the issue twice but didn't notice any action from her on this issue. Also, the flight was delayed by about 90 minutes. We had to wait from about 9:30 PM (Addis Time) in the night or 12:00 AM Indian time to 9:00 AM Indian time and all that was provided was a meal by the airlines. The snack service was not repeated. Given that there is no provision for food in the Addis Ababa airport after the security check is completed, this is a very long time that the airline would be hosting the guests and should plan accordingly for delay in flights. Overall experience was pretty average. Given that the airlines would like to brand itself as the gateway to Africa, it should plan better.

### "the flight was delayed"
Addis Ababa to Singapore was scheduled for 2320 on Sat. I did an online checked-in via the airline web site at 1700 on Sat and received an confirmation. There was no information that the flight time had changed during the online check-in. When I arrived at airport at 0915, I was then told that the flight was delayed till 06:20 Sun, and the check-in counter (at business class) staff told me that I could wait for the next 7 hours at the gate! After much protestation, I was referred to her supervisor who said that the airline can arrange for transit hotel, and he then appeared. After a long wait for him, and lots of chasing after ET staff - none of whom offered any help, I was at ADD airport before a transit hotel voucher was finally provided to me. Ethiopian should inform pax of any flight delays when the pax checked online - which they didn't. The cabin crew was not helpful or wanting to give any sense of service. I will never fly Ethiopian Airlines again.

### "8 Hours on the phone"
The actual experience of flying with Ethiopian is OK. Nothing special, not really on par with the transatlantic coach flights to and from Europe, but pretty standard quality of food and service that I have come to expect from flights to and from Africa. However, a colleague had a medical emergency so I had to extend my trip, which meant I had to rebook my returning ticket. I cannot express to you the horror of that experience. Despite the fact that I was more than willing to pay whatever necessary change fees and rate differences, it took me a total of 8 Hours on the phone with them to rebook. They do not allow rebooking online, which meant that I had to spend an entire day on hold with various people, which is not easy (or Cheap) from a remote part of Ghana with little cell service. Every time I would get through the hold line and speak with a representative, they would figure out a flight for me, then "transfer" me to their sales department, and I would be hung up on. Or I would be on hold for an hour Then hung up on. After the complete mess that was finally getting this sorted out was finished, After 8 hours of this nonsense, they tell me that I cannot be confirmed for the rebook yet because I had to pay the change fees first, In Person In Cash. What airline in 2018 doesn't accept online payments, card payments over the phone, or even wired money? Of course, I was in rural Ghana, which meant I couldn't spend 3 days traveling from there to their head office in the capital to pay this change fee when the entire point was that I was unable to travel to Accra at that time for my original flight. After 2 weeks of fighting with them over the phone about this, Finally one of the local agents tells me I can pay the money into their bank account in a city nearby my location (who knows Why no one ever gave me that option previously!?). I was very worried this would turn out to be a scam because it was a pretty sketchy set up, but it worked out in the end. Moral of the story; if you can avoid booking with Ethiopian Airlines, Do It, because it you have any problems at all you are out of luck.

### "trip was smooth and punctual"
Dar es Salaam to Bangkok via Addis Ababa on 8th August 2018. Checked in online after some difficulties, but was allowed to transit 7 hours prior to departure. Granted 3rd part lounge in Dar is Tanzanite which always gives me problems when entering. Always greedy after money and this time they wanted to charge me 35 USD because I was “2 hours early”. This, despite I had Lounge Invitation printed on my BPs. I had to call ET-manager to access. The lounge is so, so, but they have plenty hot snacks and drinks. Aircraft B787-900 on 1st leg was downgraded to a smaller B737 due to low load in economy. However, that caused 3 biz-passengers to be downgraded. Without being requested, I volunteered to do so and got 250 USD in ET-vouchers as compensation. The check-in staff came to the lounge and were relieved by my decision. I was fine as I still had my special meal and lounge access. I was treated like a king to Addis: despite travelling economy I almost felt ashamed getting champagne and foods from bz-class brought down discretely to row 17. I even got my special meal (red-snapper) but had to additional dishes, veal and beef, all very tasty. Got the menu from business could choose food and drinks from there. Only downturn was the plastic cutlery. They gave me 3 seats for myself despite economy became 75% full. Cloud Nine Lounge in Addis was OK but no showers neither there not in any other lounge in Addis. Tried to cash my vouchers but failed. Both flights almost on time. The 2nd leg on B787-8 was in 2-2-2 configuration in Biz, which is quite cramped compared to Qatar´s much more spacious 1-2-1. That trip was smooth and punctual. Good IFE, drinks, and foods.

### "the flight was overbooked"
Vienna to Lusaka via Addis Ababa, Worst travel experience. Firstly got bumped off my connection flight to Lusaka from Addis apparently the flight was overbooked. This happened just before boarding and staff were extremely unhelpful and gave conflicting statements. Waited about 4 hours after missing the flight to be given an alternative flight for the following day. Was then informed that my bags had already left and I would find them in Lusaka. When I finally got to Lusaka my bags were not there! No explanation provided.

### "deserve roughly their 4 stars"
Bangkok to Dar es Salaam via Addis Ababa on B787-8 aircraft. Bought a promotional ticket and enjoyed all the privileges fully. This airline suits me well and is excellent when there are no logistic problems. Checked in on-line with some difficulties – had to reload the pages several times. Printed BPs accepted throughout though the airport and replaced by “originals” at the gate. Flights on time. Miracle Lounge in BKK opposite their departure gate D4 is very nice, had a shower. Cabin 2-2-2 configuration in business slightly cramped – they gave me two seats so I felt comfortable. Food and drink offering onboard was good and exotic. Given dinner (3 choices) at around 2:30 a.m. and again breakfast before landing despite the flight lasts only 7½ hour. FAs are kind but much less professional than for Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines. Special meal accommodated. IFE excellent. The airport in Addis needs expansion and tends to be very crowded and messy. Lounges in Addis were full, though with good food and Wi-Fi. Smokers area like a pig-stall. Gate for second flight changed 3 times, including flight number. Poor signage and information at most gates made frustrated and panicking passengers. Nice airline, deserve roughly their SKYTRAX 4 stars but no more. However, we are very far from getting the 5th compared to downgrade to the 3rd.

### "No explanations nothing"
Washington to Blantyre via Addis Ababa. We boarded the plane then they announce that the door can not close. we were on the plane for over 3 hours without food or drink. Then they made us get off the plane to board another plane. An hour or so later we boarded the same plane we were sitting for 3hrs on. No explanations nothing. I asked for something to eat as I need to take medication I was denied food. Worst experience ever flying. I have written to them to complain and up to now no one from Ethiopian Airlines has bothered to contact me or respond.

### "Good food, great service"
Tel Aviv to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. The seat pitch is noticeably more than on other airlines bigger aircraft. Good food, great service and smooth transit. Would definitely fly Ethiopian again!

### "don't put yourself through such"
So I was told my Ethiopian Airlines flight from Ethiopia to Botswana was full and I would have to sleep in the airport until tomorrow for the next flight. After 13 hours of flying. My head and body hurt so bad. Just don't put yourself through such.

### "inefficient under staffed"
I did a return trip with these guys from Johannesburg to Ouagadougou via Addis Ababa. Not one part of the transit went well, besides the checkin at JHB. This is by far the worst airline and airport experience ever. They are completely inefficient under staffed.

### "comfortable and pleasurable"
Lagos to Newark via Lome. It was an absolute pleasure flying Ethiopian to the US. For an 11 hour flight it was very comfortable and pleasurable. From Check in to boarding the process was really smooth. The transit was equally very smooth. In-flight entertainment was also great and plenty of leg room even in economy. I'll recommend Ethiopian for any one flying to the US from Africa.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Johannesburg to Nairobi via Addis Adaba. I was hesitant to book with Ethiopian airlines, however the schedule suited us. We flew from Johannesburg to Nairobi with a stop over in Addis Adaba. Firstly our plane was delayed by a couple of hours in Addis Adaba which is no big deal however we were ushered into a gate that was a construction zone through security where we had to wait. There was no air conditioning and the drinking water tanks were all empty. When we finally got on the plane I had to ask 5 times for some water for my children. I had pre selected our seats and was told that due to traveling with children we could not sit in the selected seats as it was an exit row. So they reallocated our seats and we were not sitting with our 5 and 7 year old children. I argued that I was not willing to allow my young children to sit next to strangers. I was told that I had to swap myself with other passengers when I boarded the plane. Luckily the other passengers allowed us to sit together. No thanks to Ethiopian Airlines. I also noticed after boarding that our original allocated seats were NOT in an exit row. When we arrived at Nairobi 2 of our bags were missing. After spending over an hour filling out paperwork at the airport we finally got to leave without the 2 bags. After 3 days of having no clothes mosquito spray and toiletries which we had to purchase ourselves again, our bags were located and my safari company picked the bags up for us. When we received the bags they were both badly broken. I spoke to the manager when we returned to the airport and was told there was nothing she could do and we should speak to the manager when we arrive back to Johannesburg. I spoke to somebody at the desk in Johannesburg and he gave me more paperwork and was told somebody would contact me. It has now been 3 weeks and after I have sent many emails, messages etc I still haven’t heard back from the airline.

### "impressed by their professionalism"
Not Verified |  Recently I was traveling from New Delhi to Cape Town via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. At Cape Town International airport, I found my big trolley bag is broken. I lodged a complain at the Baggage Claim counter. The took my details. Within 3 days they collected the broken luggage from my flat and in another 7 days they replaced it with a brand new trolley bag with same size and same color. I am really impressed by their professionalism. Thank you Ethiopian Airlines

### "terrible check-in process"
c✅ Trip Verified |  London to Blantyre via Addis Ababa. Terrible check-in process at all airports. Could only check in for one flight at a time, had to provide the credit card used while in Addis Ababa (what if we hadn’t brought it?) despite booking months in advance. Unfriendly customer service. Was not clear on booking they flights 2+3 was a stopover rather than a transfer which was nice except it led to ticketing confusion which annoyed their staff. Food was acceptable but ran out of options halfway. Great range of meal choices offered on the website. I picked a Hindi meal. These were not offered on any flights - only chicken or beef. They were always out of the vegetarian option and usually out of the beef. They did at least fill my water bottle multiple times.

### "I am very displeased"
I checked a bag into Ethiopian Airlines on my flight from Enugu to Heathrow London on the 16th of June 2018. I have not seen my baggage and I made an official report in Heathrow and they said they will bring the bag. 3 days later, they have not brought my bag. Never knew it is a risk to check in my bag on an Ethiopian Airlines flight. I still have my baggage claim receipt and the proof of my report. I am very displeased.

### "Young, friendly cabin staff"
Bangkok to Hong Kong. Young, friendly cabin staff. Food and IFE okay. Aircraft although relatively new felt worn out, especially the seat cushions. Plenty of legroom and flight only 1/3 full, including the return flight from HKG to BKK. Bargain price (100GBP for return flight) since I booked the day before, cheaper than a LLC ticket!

### "one of my best economy flights"
Transited in Addis on my way to Khartoum on 8th June 2018. The airport (T2) is overcrowded, messy, and queues everywhere. Boarding tedious and waiting for ½-1 hour for the bus in overcrowded narrow room at Gate 13. We became >½ hours late departing, but as the plane was full it was almost excusable. As the pax-load was full and the aircraft was a smaller B737-800 they were seizing and checking in hand-luggage for a lot of overloaded passengers, inclusive of myself. I argued that I need to go with my hand-luggage as I was only transiting in KRT and could not retrieve it easily without a visa to Sudan. After some discussion they eventually allowed my two pieces to pass to be taken on board. On board I had one of my best economy flights for years: FAs were fit, well rested, effective, focused, and kind and expedite. Despite the flight was full and the duration were only 1½-2 hours, everything worked to perfection. Two hot meals offered, I chose a fish steak for breakfast. It was so good I had to inquire for one additional. Voila, in 6-8 seconds after I told this to the FA it was on my plate. Drinks offered were plenty including wine and beers. The brands were well selected and tasted very well for economy class. The FAs came around and asked if there were other requests they could assist with. They served us until we landed and there were no stops in service from kick-off till landing. They were so well groomed, professional, and neat. IFE were missing apart from radio/music access. The aircraft appeared new and in good condition despite being an old model. At arrival, two stairways were put up allowing for quick disembarking being taken by bus to the arrival area and then confronted with the harsh Sudanese immigration where huge patience is the strongest weapon to overcome the hurdles.

### "Upgraded from economy class"
Travelled Kigali to Addis 8th June 2018 at 02 a.m. on a small B737-700. Upgraded successfully from economy class by putting my modest bid through their homepage. Check-in was very lengthy as they could not issue the second boarding pass when I was upgraded on the first sector. I could not accept it and stood at the counter almost ½ hour before the second BP came out. Worth waiting for compared to waiting at a transfer counter in ADD to get it. It eventually went through and I then enjoyed the lounge access in KGL and good service on board in the four rows of business class (cabin ½ full). I was disappointed they only served breakfast as I needed dinner. But I spotted from the menu card the dinner served on the incoming flight. I then managed to secure my favourite dinner from that menu, despite it was not on offer and a few hours old, but reheated. Pre-departure champagne brut (“Lallier”) was fine. FAs attentive. Seats extremely well bolstered. Good product.

### "a good business class"
Abidjan to Bangkok via Addis Ababa. I now frequently use Ethiopian on trips from Bangkok to Africa as they provide a good business class at reasonable prices and extremely good connections, with relatively short transfer times in Addis. Food is generally quite good on Ethiopian, local wines excellent and service attentive. On my last flight (ET618), instead of the now usual Dreamliner, Ethiopian used an older B767, with a very limited entertainment system, as they only showed African, Asian, Hindi and 4 European movies and no blockbusters or US movies; also, immigration forms were not available, but otherwise, a very pleasant flight.

### "FAs excellent and attentive"
❌ Not Verified |  Addis Ababa to Stockholm. Flights to Cape Town from Stockholm are thin on the ground. You can either choose the major European carriers such as BA, KLM's daylight service or AF (all of which are about €800) or use Emirates or Qatar and make do with the long flights through the Middles East. I decided to use Ethiopian Airlines which was the most cost effective and fastest service (< 2 hours connection times in both directions) Although 3 out of 4 legs were in economy, I'm going to review the business class service which I won through a reverse auction. As a self employed person, the only other 787 business I have flown is Qatar Airways 1-2-1 product. Ethiopian uses a 2-2-2. This means that there is a distinct advantage of taking one of the center seats where both you and your neighbor have direct aisle access. That being said, I really didn't notice the smaller seat width as the proof of the pudding is in the sweat pitch. FAs were excellent and attentive (as good as the Middle East airlines). Food seemed good (though not brilliant) as I took a night flight and just had water and tea. IFE was excellent in terms of screen size and choices. Bed was almost flat but long enough to sleep for most of the flight. Only downside was having one toilet for the whole cabin compared to Qatar which has two for only 20 seats. Lastly, for all the bad press that Bole airport has, whilst it wasn't a dream, it was no worse than I've been to in other parts of Europe for sheer chaos. I wouldn't like to spend 8 hours there. The most worrying aspect was the runway setup which meant that both landing and departing aircraft had to taxi across the runway to get to the gates or line up for take off. A little investment at the East and West entry points could solve this relatively easy.

### "without charm but efficient"
London to Blantyre via Addis Ababa. Outbound from Heathrow to Addis on A350 on time and full. Seat room better than most airlines. Food was ordinary and cabin crew efficient. Addis Ababa to Blantyre Malawi - old and quite tatty Boeing 737-800. Plane full and left on time en route to Lilongwe and then finally to Malawi. Flight of 5 hrs plus and no in flight entertainment-drop down screens did not work. Addis Ababa to Lilongwe leg-passenger became ill on route - a medical emergency due to diabetic seizure. Luckily two doctors on board, and the female doctor and the cabin crew administered a drip and patient recovered. Full praise to the doctor and cabin crew who had the necessary first aid kit and were calm and efficient throughout. We were not diverted. Eventually arrived in Blantyre on time - you are not allowed off the aircraft at Lilongwe if in transit. Return leg- Blantyre to Addis Ababa Boeing 737-800 - this was a newer cleaner aircraft. Meal was served which was reasonable but the passenger behind me had a beef stew which was cold and had to be replaced. Addis to London an A350- a newer aircraft, comfortable seats. Configuration a little strange - very large galley area and a large space near emergency doors at rear of the aircraft. I hope they leave this space as it is and not add extra seats. Flight was over 7 hours and they served a snack instead of an evening meal - a dry "chicken roll" which has nearly no filling and was very poor followed by a cereal bar. Before landing there was a "breakfast" which was egg, potato and a synthetic thing called a sausage. This was probably the worst breakfast I have tried to eat in many years of flying and I had to leave most of it. Plane was on time. Cabin crew were without charm but were efficient. The coffee was good throughout these flights - unlike many other airlines.

### "pleasant and accommodating crew"
Two excellent flights with Ethiopian Airlines. Both flights on time, very pleasant and accommodating crew, good food and beverages, loved the Ethiopian Merlot. Good business class seats, no complaints at all! Only part of the trip I was not happy with? Security at Addis airport, rude, unpleasant, not enough English language skills, did not like it one bit!

### "seats  must have been 17 years old"
Mekele to Dakar via Addis Ababa. The short flight from Mekele to Addis Ababa was on B737 with good regional business class but very low quality snack was served. On arrival all business class passengers got into minivan, only I was told to take economy class bus as minivan is only for VIP passengers. Older business class lounge in Addis Ababa but fine for 2 hours and with quite good breakfast selection. When I did web checking I noticed that originaly scheduled B787 was switched to B767. I was not alarmed as all Boeing 767 were supposed to be refurbished with lie flat beds. So I was shocked when I boarded to see recliner seats which must have been 17 years old. The seat would be ok for short regional flight but not for 10 hours I spent on the plane (there was technical stop in Bamako). On seat under the pillow and blanket there was left lots of rubbish from previous flights. Only overhead monitors were available and these were so low quality and dark that it was impossible to watch anything. Crew was just OK. They did what they were supposed to do but not very friendly. Food was edible, with the exception of Ethiopian dish which was excellent (you get both western and Ethiopian dish) and it is good that they serve it from trolley, otherwise I would have difficulties to know what to choose. In future if I could be guaranteed that flight would be operated with A350 or B787 and ticket price would be good, I wouldn’t have problem flying Ethiopian again. But knowing that the planes can be switched to this kind of inferior product, I would not fly again with them. When I was leaving Dakar (fortunately on other airline) there was Ethiopian Boeing 737 at airport. I am not sure if it was originally scheduled airplane or there was aircraft change, but this B737 would be even worse for length of this flight than the B767.

### "They cancelled my flight"
Dar Es salaam to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. This is the worst experience I've had with an airline. They cancelled my flight and didn’t notify me. I incurred hotel costs and were unwilling to reimburse me. The worst part is their customer service, their agent hung up on me when I trying to request another flight. Please stay away from them. I don’t want anyone to go through what I went through.

### "leg space in economy good"
Cape Town to Frankfurt via Addis Ababa. Friendly staff at check-in counters, leg space in economy good. The plane not very clean, my seat was wet, rubbish was in the seat pocket, received a chicken dish that was tough - the friendly cabin staff replaced it with the other meal option. I did forget (and so did the staff) that I ordered the vegan option online. On my flight back I did receive the vegan meals - from Frankfurt to Addis Ababa it was very pleasant, from Addis Ababa to Cape Town it was dry and spicy and I couldn't eat it. From Addis Ababa to Cape Town the cabin staff was very inattentive - it was freezing cold in the plane and only after my third request and 25min later did I receive a blanket

### "helpful and courteous"
Dublin to Los Angeles. Check in desk staff very helpful and courteous both in Dublin and Los Angeles. Plane clean, very comfortable and Air Hostess also very helpful and polite. I found the flight very smooth, plenty of inflight movies etc. It was my first time flying with this airline and I would have no hesitation in booking another flight with Ethiopian Airlines.

### "Addis Ababa airport very old"
London to Harare via Addis Ababa with 3 adults, a child 7 years and a toddler 14 months. Addis Ababa airport very old and quite dirty, not enough seating considering it’s one of the main points for transferring passengers to the rest of world. A lot of the same shops not a good variety or choices. Not a lot of food shops, a lot of souvenir shops and very expensive too. Plane service from staff bad, I don’t know if it’s a culture thing but some staff no thank you or please. They tell you how it is, it’s like they had no customer service training what so ever. One even rolled her eyes at me! When I ask them for water or if they have food for my tod (of course I had some, but I did request when booking flight), they say I will check and never come back to me with an answer. Flight attendants talk across the aisles and passing food and drinks to each other, over passengers heads. Very unprofessional and disorganised. Food choices and quality was poor, I know being in economy doesn’t help but I’ve seen and tasted better. When they run out of one option they say to me beef? Instead of apologising for running out of options and offering me beef. What if I had said no? Entertainment wasn’t bad. Seating was quite spacious (comparing to Virgin Atlantic). Plane from London to Addis Ababa was quite new so felt clean. Addis Ababa onwards plane condition quite old and tattered.

### "the worst customer service"
Cape Town to Riyadh via Addis Ababa. I fly regularly with Ethiopian Airlines for reasons of trip time. The staff are very friendly but the airline has the worst customer service. The return leg of the flight Cape Town - Addis Ababa - Riyadh flight was changed in itinerary in 2017 so that the all of the connecting international flights from Addis to Riyadh are 20 minutes after landing. The connecting flight includes a bus transfer to Terminal 2 and then a bus transfer from terminal 2 to terminal 1 (no direct option). This transfer time takes on average 40 minutes from time of landing (I have done this flight for 4 years 4-6 times a year) this means that the airline sells transfer / connecting flights that are impossible to catch. The first time I was caught out on this trip I ended up spending 9 hours in terminal 1 (a terminal that is not fit for international travellers in terms of cleanliness and facilities). On this occasion I had to wait 5 hours before anyone could tell me that a replacement flight could be obtained and waited an additional 4 hours for the next flight. The next time I flew this route after seeking assurance from the customer services that I could make the connecting flight, I ended up staying 24 hours and it took more than 12 hours before any representative could tell me; 1 if i would be getting another flight and 2 in this case a hotel. The local representative took my passport and returned it 12 hours later. Even now, if I phone and speak to supervisors of the airline they assure me that a 20 minute stopover on an international flight is acceptable. This means anyone on this flight will need the pilot to land in excess of 1 hour early. This is the issue with flights - however the real tragedy and stunning lack of assistance comes when trying to redeem airmiles. Having tried for 5 hours once with online assistance and 5 phone calls to Ethiopia South Africa and Saudi local offices, the transaction was not able to complete without a visit to a local branch - thus 3 hours online 2 hours of telephone calls and 1 and a half hours of trip to local office to get a single return flight – 6 and a half hours of time including lost working time. On a trip to South Africa in January this year I tried to upgrade my ticket to business class. This could not be achieved online so after 2 hours on the phone the assistant could not take payment of any of my credit cards. This left me with no option but to travel into central Cape Town to pay. On a separate occasion in the beginning of 2017 I received a (false) email message on a Saturday that my return flight to Saudi Arabia was being brought forward by 1 day. After 3 hours attempting to contact Ethiopian airlines locally and internationally (no answer local or on the international toll number) and a trip to the airport we found out the email was incorrect. I am not joking when I say that the list goes on. But systems that don’t work, false instructions impossible connections and lack of ability to contact or get assistance, staff not picking up telephones, local toll free numbers that do not work etc. mean that this airline is a disaster for the traveller.

### "the airport was dirty"
Kigali to London via Addis Ababa. I will never fly Ethiopian airlines again. The worst service I have ever experienced, the airport was dirty, credit card machines were broken both times I was there, the bathrooms were overcrowded, and the staff were outright rude to passengers. I thought the cheaper price would be worth it, but now I know to pay slightly more and travel with another airline.

### "traveling alone with a baby"
Tel Aviv to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. I was traveling alone with my 3 month old. At check in in Tel Aviv I requested to be given a seat on the 11th row (first row in economy) so that I could get a baby bed. 11th row is usually the first in economy for the Ethiopian Airlines flights I took. The check in woman told me the row was on an exit so she couldn't. So I asked for a window seat & she said all were booked. I was placed on row 12 in the middle column. When we boarded, I noticed there was no one on the seats on row 11 ahead of me. The row wasn't on an exit either and the other row 11 seats on the right and left were occupied each by a family with 2 kids each. Also, there were several unoccupied window seats. I checked in 3hrs before the flight & usually those travelling with infants & toddlers have to do a physical check in, not online. I was the only person traveling alone with a baby and mine was the youngest infant. I should have at least gotten some consideration if not first priority.

### "definitely fly Ethiopian again"
Bangkok to Kiliminjaro via Addis Ababa Outbound flight to JRO via ADD and inbound to BKK via ADD were very smooth and on time. The cabin on the Boeing 787 is large, big windows and air humidity control, comfortable seats brightly colored in green upholstery all make for a pleasant journey. Even in economy class I received a travel kit with toothbrush, toothpaste, socks and a really useful eye-mask that actually helped me get to sleep and stay asleep. Food was served twice on the red-eye between BKK and ADD. I declined the first meal to sleep instead, but breakfast was acceptable with juices and hot coffee served. The terminal at ADD is a bit chaotic but was able to find restrooms, then a cafe with reasonably priced food and free wifi between flights. There are no lounges accessible with Priority Pass. Aside from Cloud 9 or Star Alliance lounges there are some open free areas with lounge beds that allow you to fully lie down and rest. Lunch between ADD and JRO, on an A330 this time, was tasty and went down well with red wine. Return flights were about the same in terms of food and flight comfort, and both legs were on the Dreamliner. Excellent IFE on the Dreamliner, plenty of choices of movies, documentaries and TV series. Service on all legs was good but FAs could have brought around liquid refreshments more often to keep us better hydrated. Great value for money and would definitely fly Ethiopian again on this route.

### "nice, helpful and understanding"
I was sceptical about booking Ethiopian Airlines because of the reviews I had read in the past. However, I decided to try them and see for myself. The flight was from Lagos, Nigeria to Toronto, Canada. I can testify that it was a wonderful experience. From the hostesses to the pilots, they were courteous! I travelled with my family and my toddler which was a handful. The hostesses were so nice, helpful and understanding! There was also entertainment kits for kids. They were always checking up on us to see if we needed anything. I am going to fly Ethiopian Airlines again and I recommend them to others.

### "no offers for compensation"
I booked return ticket from Cape Town to Dubai via Addis Ababa. When I was supposed to return to Cape Town on 4th February, there was a whole mess with misconnection, because the Dubai to Addis (ET601) was delayed and late. The connection time was too short, and on the flight, the flight attendants promised is that they made contact with Addis Ababa airport control room and that the Addis to Cape Town flight (ET 847) would wait for us. When we got to Addis Ababa, the flight ET847 already departed. We were booked into a terrible hotel. No apologies, no offers for compensation or upgrades. The attitude was, this happened and there is nothing we can do about it.

### "flight was punctual, service excellent"
In course of 12 days in January I flew 4 sectors with Ethiopian Airlines, Tel-Aviv to Addis, Addis to Nairobi and the same return. In each instance the flight was punctual, service excellent, food good and baggage successfully transferred at Addis. Certainly Bole International Airport at Addis is a confusing building, not my favourite place to transfer but once you know your way around it is tolerable. I have no hesitation in recommending Ethiopian Airlines as an excellent choice for travel.

### "no hesitation in recommending"
London to Zanzibar via Addis Ababa. My wife and I have travelled from UK to Zanzibar, typically once a year since 2001 and have just made our 17th such round trip, and for a second time with Ethiopian Airlines through Addis Abba. The service we received on all four legs was excellent with new  A350 aircraft on all but ADD - ZNZ which was a Boeing 787-8, that although it was beginning to look a little tired in places, was nevertheless a great aircraft to fly on. However the A350 is even better and noticably quieter especially when climbing after takeoff. Our four flights took off on time and arrived either on time or early. The standard service in Economy was both efficient and courteous, and could put other better known airlines covering the same destination via the Middle East that we have used, to shame. The food and beverage offer was better than one often finds on long haul economy and was served with charm by attentive cabin crews that clearly they wanted to be of service. As one might expect on the such a modern fleet of aircraft, the touch-screen in-flight entertainment worked well, was intuitive to use, and offered an excellent range of films and audio. Ingeniously, some days before departure Ethiopian Airlines invited on line bids to upgrade to "Cloud 9" business class on each leg, and we made an "offer" for the upgrade on the final ADD-LHR leg which was accepted. This gave us access to the comfortable "Cloud 9" lounge for the 5 hour layover between flights on the return which was very welcome. At some 7800ft above sea level, Addis Abba airport is in fact a very acceptable airport hub, though without the glitz and resultant high prices often found. An unusual and welcome feature are the various "quiet" areas around the terminal to while-away time between flights that have chaise-longue to stretch out full length on, as well as more conventional seats It is perhaps unusual to experience an airline's "economy" and "business" class offerings back to back on similar A350 aircraft, but we can confirm that "Cloud 9" compares very well with other long haul airlines that we have used previously. Based on our experience we would have no hesitation in recommending Ethiopian Airlines as an effective way to reach the increasingly popular holiday destination of Zanzibar from the UK and would expect to use them again for our next trip there.

### "ignored requests to compensate expenses"
Booked flights from Brussels to Seychelles with Ethiopian Airlines last year. Paid in full and received tickets, but month after this airline contacted me and told that they made a mistake with the tickets and I need to pay nearly half of what I have already paid if I want to have my tickets (govt taxes), otherwise they will be cancelled. I found out that Ethiopian Airlines breached IATA rules and issued tickets on Air Seychelles ticket stock. So about two months after they were issued, my tickets were cancelled and airline ignored all my requests to compensate expenses for already made travel arrangements. Facebook negatives comments were deleted by the airline straight away. They don't even know what good customer service means.

### "They have great attitude"
Addis Ababa to Washington via Dublin. The flight itself was very good! I would like to thank the hostesses who flew from Ethiopia to Washington on Jan 25, 2018. They were very humble, and very respectful. They treat everyone the same. They have great attitude. They were very cooperative to my needs. They work very hard. I didn’t see them taking a break. I love flying Ethiopian!

### "flight was delayed again"
Oslo to Stockholm. The flight was delayed, we've been told it was because of a missing part. They kept us in the airport until 24:00 o'clock and later sent us to hotel, we had only 4 hours to sleep and then had to go again to the airport. The day after the flight was delayed again in few hours because they didn't organize the tickets changing. They kept us for a long time waiting in the airport and on the plane. Later on I sent Ethiopian Airlines emails and messages about the compensation I deserve, though I've been ignored.

### "should communicate with their passengers"
Flew Ethiopian Airlines from Addis Ababa to Los Angeles. I went on holiday and flew with them twice and each time was frustrating. The attendants are rude and have an attitude about anything you ask them. During my first flight, I asked four different people for water and waited for over half an hour with nothing. I had to get up and go to the back, where they were all just sitting and talking. I proceeded to get my own water while they all looked at me. Then on the way back from my trip, we were told our flight was on time. Then we were told it was delayed 30 minutes due to a small issue. Then we heard nothing for two hours. My sister and I were travelling together. I bought our tickets together and specifically requested that we are seated together. I asked an attendant to change my seat since I specifically requested two seats together. She told me the flight was full and I should look in the computer myself to find a seat that was together. I went to another attendant on the place and she said there were many extra seats so she had no problem getting me two seats next to each other. Also, my flight was supposed to be a straight flight from Ethiopia to LAX but somehow we ended up in Dublin. I understand that they need to stop and refuel but they should communicate with their passengers. The Dublin authority came on the plane and requested to see all our boarding passes and passports and they made us get up to search through all our seats. It was too long for a trip to be that frustrating. I will never use this airline again.

### "lost two of our three bags"
London to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. The entire airline experience and our trip was ruined as Ethiopian Airlines lost two of our three bags between London and Johannesburg -- including one with an entire family's Christmas gifts and all shopping done during our trip. The quality of in-flight service, airplane, entertainment etc become irrelevant when you get to your destination and your valuable luggage has been lost. There were a number of people on the same flight with the same problem.

### "service onboard was very slow"
Dar Es Salaam to Washington via Addis Ababa. Not very good experience! The service onboard was very slow. The flight attendants were not helpful. Every time I turned on my call light, which was a few times, no one every answered. I got up to go to the back and find a flight attendant. I found them sitting having conversations without any care for what was going on in the aircraft. When I asked for a cup of water, one of the attendants acted like it was the largest burden in the world! Also, they charge insane fees for changing your flight. No grace, no mercy. Horrible customer service and horrible in-flight service.

### "Worst customer service"
Tel Aviv to Antananaviro  via Addis ababa. Worst customer service ever. I had my luggage missing for a week in Madagascar, a place where it is impossible to find replacements. When the language arrived, several items were missing. Eventually, after several weeks of emails, they agreed for a 75$ compensation, which is ridiculously low. But as I said that it is an unacceptable sum they started to ignore my emails and I haven't received a cent. The planes were old, entertainment system is probably from the early 90s. The only good thing was that they provided free hotel in Addis Ababa for the connection overnight. Make sure you ask for it at the airport check-in.

### "definitely travel with them again"
Toronto to Windhoek via Addis Ababa. This is the first time I've been compelled to rate an airline. I only have positive things to say about Ethiopian Airlines. The service from the beginning was excellent from the staff. The boarding process was a little chaotic, but I feel that it was more due to the airports rather than the airline. Upon boarding, all passengers were  provided with a small care package of socks, eyemask, and ear plugs, which were a godsend to get some sleep. The food served onboard was excellent, I was served 3 meals and 2 snacks during my flight from Toronto > Addis Ababa. The movie selection was great, and I managed to stay entertained for the entire 13 hour flight. The plane itself was starting to show minor wear and tear, but nothing too terrible. The lavatories were kept very clean by the flight attendants. I had a much better experience with Ethiopian Air versus with the domestic US/Canada airlines. I would definitely travel with them again. Well done, to the entire team!

### "customer relations is non existent"
The Addis Ababa to Durban leg ceased to operate on 1 Aug, but I was not informed of any changes until 2 Oct, ie 61 days later, which was my day of travel from home to get my 01.30 flight from Bangkok on 3 Oct. The new flight details routed me via Addis Ababa and Jo'burg but failed to provide a Jo'burg to Durban leg. I contacted Ethiopian by email as their Thailand Customer Service number did not exist. My email was acknowledged by computer but no one actually dealt with my problem despite 2 further emails that day. I organised my own flight from Jo'burg to Durban. Prior to my return flight I managed to get Ethiopian to provide a Durban to Jo'burg leg and thus I could continue my journey home. The flights were OK but boarding was as always late and at Addis Ababa we were directed to 3 different Gates by staff contrary to the Gate Information Boards before we got on the plane. The food was pretty awful. The Dreamliner 787 has the AV controls in the armrest - what idiot designer put them there? Every time you rest your arm or get up you change the AV system or call the stewardess or turn off a light. Probably a designer who has never flown before! On returning home it took ten days for the Customer relations to answer my complaint and they failed to address any of the points raised. I am still fighting them. Their administrative organisation is a mess and their ability to deal with operational changes is hopeless. Their customer relations is non existent.

### "I love the A350"
Addis Ababa to London overnight on Ethiopian Airlines A350. Boarding was quick, all done in 25 minutes with a 85% full plane. Pulled back on time, ie 01.05. Flight time was announced as 7 hrs 15 mins. Reduced size dinner due to time served at 0230, it was fine (I had eaten in a restaurant around 2030). Lights then put off for approx. 150 minutes, then breakfast served. For some reason we were forced to circle 3 times in stack over Essex so for no fault of the airline we didn't land till 06.55. As a very regular London to Addis Ababa flyer I love the A350 even more than Ethiopian's Boeing 787. Cannot fault the flight but was still waiting for bags at LHR T2 70 minutes after landing. Ethiopian has about 25,000 passengers per day. Most of whom do not put up reviews as they are quite happy with things.

### "review is about the onboard food"
Cape Town to Dublin via Addis Ababa. It's my first international round trip, so I have nothing to compare it to. My review is strictly about the onboard food options. My partner and I placed special food orders beforehand and double and triplechecked to ensure it was properly understood. We ordered vegan options i.e. pure vegetarian i.e. free from animal flesh, egg or dairy (milk, creamer, cheese, margarine, butter etc.). We flew Cape Town to Addis / Addis to Dublin return. Cape Town to Addis was fine. Every trip after that was problematic. My partner and I were sometimes given different options, and often these options included dairy of some kind. Sometimes there weren't even dairy-free coffee creamer options available. Staff need to be trained to properly understand various dietary requirements. I don't know how it compares to other on-board airline food, but these were quite boring. We had no other problems with the rest of our experience with the airline.

### "the A350 beats them all"
London to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian Airlines A350. Their 787 and 777s are great too but the A350 is quicker. I have used it twice to Addis this year, January it was only 6 hrs 30 mins flying time, this time 6 hrs 45 minutes. Have flown London to Addis many times on BMI. KLM, Luthansa, Emirates and the old East African Airways in the 70s. Ethiopian Airlines current service and the A350 beats them all. Even LHR Terminal 2, of which I am not fond, was smooth this time with very helpful staff at bag drop. This overnight flight to Addis is at 9pm in UK summer and 8.00pm UK winter. We rolled back in an almost full plane at 9.30 pm. The dinner served about 11 pm was great, on the box it said chicken curry but it was a lovely chicken tika masala and other items on the tray were also excellent. They serve Habesha, one of several excellent Ethiopian lagers but unfortunately do not yet do Ethiopia's first class Rift Valley wines. Arrived Addis 06.30 and visas on arrival was also extremely efficient and quick despite a queue of around 30 people. I fly London to Addis return on average three times a year and right now would not consider any other airline for it. In the past 2 years have also flown Addis Bangkok return, Addis to Capetown, Joburg to Addis. All excellent flights with no problems. Be aware that Ethiopian Airlines satisfied customers do not mostly write on here.

### "cheapest price but think twice"
You may think you want to fly the cheapest price but think twice. On our trip this month, after buying the ticket in May, we were told 5 weeks before return flight that there had been some changes and that we had to call in. No phone number was given to call of course. I call USA number and was told the flight was cancelled and we had to return a day later. I confirmed the new reservations. I then had to re-buy new domestic connection tickets on my dime. While we were in Madagascar, with no phone we kept getting emails that our flight was cancelled and that we had to call. We could not connect a call even on Skype. We finally connected with Ethiopian on departure date and it turned out that they had not cancelled the original reservation so that they had duplicate reservations. This took over $100 of cell minutes to establish. When we checked in for return flight from Madagascar, Ethiopian could not print the boarding passes for the onward ticket from Addis Ababa to Washington DC. We were told not to worry and that we would be met at the plane and given our boarding passes. The plane departed Madagascar late after they refused to allow us to carry on bags (despite a check in 3.5 hours early amd half the plane been allowed to). We are now in Addis Ababa and find that there is an unannounced extra stop in Dublin and that our seats have been given away. No body met us with boarding passes and we are now trying to get some.

### "recommend if you get a good deal"
Nairobi to Bangkok via Addis Ababa. Old plane from Nairobi to Addis Ababa, tray for meal on the seat was broken. Food was ok but cake and snack were very low quality. Friendly staff. A poor lounge at Addis Ababa. Overall I would recommend if you get a good deal. However the flight service was surprisingly good.

### "Friendly proactive flight attendants"
Muscat - Addis Ababa - Kigali and Entebbe - Addis Ababa - Muscat in Business. Check-in in MCT and EBB swift. Outbound both flights were on time. On the return, EBB-ADD was about one hour late. This was no problem since we still had sufficient time in ADD (and the lounge in ADD terminal 1 was abysmal anyway). Seats in the Ethiopian B737 were of the old cradle type and did not incline very far. Still they were spacious and comfortable and, using the fold-out footrests, allowed for a nice nap. No IFE was available. Food and inflight staff on all four legs were simply excellent! Friendly proactive flight attendants served an excellent selection of Ethiopian and international dishes, accompanied by exceptionally high-quality wine. The two business class lounges in ADD couldn’t be have been more different. Where Terminal 2 features a modern, clean facility with comfortable seats, tasty food and drinks and sufficient toilet facilities, the old T1 lounge was a smelly unpleasant place with dirty plastic seats, flooded toilets and food which we did not dare touching.

### "no vegan meals arranged"
Amsterdam to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. We booked our tickets in January 2017 to fly 19th July 2017. The very next day, I emailed ethiopian airlines to enquire about our special meals and about seating. I had been struggling since day one and kept receiving errors online. Constant emails throghout the year until we eventully flew in July, they confirmed our meals and seating.. Our trip from Vienna to Addis, was awful. Our seating was out by one row which meant we did not get the arranged seating but was put in front of the toilets which flushed all night. The hostess struggled with english and when we told her we had requested special meals, she took out slips of paper out of her apron and checked our seating and said no, nothing had been arranged! We did have emergency exit seats from Addis to Cape Town but no vegan meals arranged? The air stewards / hostesses were not friendly or welcoming but short and abrupt. Lights stayed on until 2am after the hostesses walked around chatting to each other with duty free trolleys while people tried to sleep. We did not sleep a wink. I saw and hear other people around me complain that when they called a hostess, they did not come. One man kept buzzing for about 20 minutes and eventually she appeared. A woman had requested something to drink an hour or more ago and she explained that it was the third time she had asked and still nothing. We did however, have only one person who was extremely helpful ( Global Call Center Ethiopian Airlines, Bole International Airport) and communicated with me before our flights and after but this issue is now out of her hands and was sent to the customer service by me 8 days ago and no reply. This is the worse airline I have flown in 20 years of flying around the world.We are most disappointed with our trip and not sure if we will fly with Ethiopian airlines again.

### "stay 24 hours in Addis Ababa"
Frankfurt to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. First they forgot our Luggage on our way there and we were 4 days without our luggage. Then on our way back our flight was delayed and therefore we missed our connecting flight to Frankfurt. As a result we had to stay 24 hours in Addis Ababa in a hotel. But getting to the hotel was difficult because there was chaos everywhere and the ground stuff was more than unfriendly! They sent us from one counter to another and noone had any information on what we can do now! In the end we reached that hotel at 3am after spending 3 hours at the airport waiting for our shuttle. This was the most horrible flight I've ever had and the airline didn't handle it very well. I will never take this airline again and also won't recommend you to take it. Cabin staff and and the inflight entertainment were quite good. But sadly the food was horrible.

### "lost the opportunity to sleep"
Flew Business Class on Ethiopian KGL-ADD, and ADD-DUB-LAX. Seat malfunctioned in DUB, and despite efforts by crew and myself it would not recline even using manual override control under cushion. As cabin was sold out, I lost the opportunity to sleep on a very long flight. I contacted customer service and requested some compensation, who forwarded my details to the central office. Then nothing for 2 weeks until I had to re-inquire. Finally they came back and offered me US$50 or 2,000 Sheba miles. When I said that this seemed insufficient to cover the loss of the seat for 10+hrs, then said I had "utilized all the services of business class", but "to reclaim my confidence" offered to increase their offer to 2,500 Sheba miles. Needless to say I will not be flying Ethiopian again, and I would urge others to think twice. As an additional warning to those who may be considering them, the transfer in ADD is absolutely horrendous, requiring additional security screening with insufficient staff, so plan on 90-120 minutes in line with hundreds of people pushing/jumping lines.

### "the best idea in East Africa"
Lilongwe to Nairobi via Addis Ababa, they are currently the cheapest option to go. The flight was via Addis Abeba but still only half the price than a direct flight. Ethiopian usually uses a 737-800 for the LLW-ADD leg and stops in Blantyre, but on Saturdays and Sundays, it is replaced by a 767-300 and there are two seperate flights to Lilongwe and Blantyre. Check In in Lilongwe was messy, as the Check In Agents were the slowest in the world and the ticketing system failed due to a electronic problem. Ethiopian asks its passengers to arrive 3 hours prior to departure which is definetly a good call. As the online system does not know, that on Saturdays and Sundays the aircraft is changed, seats can not be preselected and so it was first come first sit. The flight was on time to depart and about 20 minutes early in Addis. Although the aircraft used was a pretty worn down 767, the seats turned out to be quite comfy and the legroom was enormous. Food was great (I preordered vegetarian) and the crew was very nice and welcoming. Bole International Airport in Addis Abeba is one of the worst managed airports I have ever been to, so as good as the flight was, as bad was the airport. The flight from Addis to Nairobi was on a new 737-800 and although it was packed full, boarding and takeoff were on time. Again very nice and friendly crew and good food. To put it in a nutshell: Flying with Ethiopian is usually the best idea in East Africa, their only downturn is their base at Bole Airport.

### "food was absolutely delicious"
Addis Ababa to London. A contrast to my flight out, this time around the food was absolutely delicious and there was lots of it! Two full meals plus two rounds of warm drinks. Cabin Crew were nice but spoke no English even for safety briefings. IFE was the same boring selection of bland American rubbish as the flight out. The plane was clean although the toilets were in a bit of a state halfway through the 7 hour flight.

### "The IFE was boring"
London to Addis Ababa. The food was inedible, meatballs in a gloopy tomato sauce with pasta tubes. The crew were friendly enough but just doing a job. English announcements (I encountered this on domestic flights and my return too) appeared to be someone reading and transliterating from Amharic into a language they don't speak, which was hilarious on occasion. The IFE was boring, packed full of American rubbish. Literally every single comedy on offer was American for some reason. The flight was more or less on time.

### "booked flight on another airline"
Riyadh to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. I booked a flight with Attar travels and paid cash for my ticket. On arrival at the airport in Riyadh I should in the line at the counter from 12 midnight waiting for check-in till 3.30am. No one showed up to check us in or explain anything to us. Because we continued to wait till after 3.30am (flight departure time), security asked us to move outside with our luggage. No one was explaining if there was a technical problem or flight cancellation or just a delay. No one from Ethiopian airlines was at the airport to assist with any queries. It turned out to be that this flight was delayed five times for the day. After numerous enquiries it was discovered that Ethiopian airlines was removing illegal immigrants from Saudi Arabia on flights that we had paid for. Eventually when they decided to check us in, they issued me with incorrect boarding passes and I ended up walking from one terminal to the next to try and correct this, until I missed my flight. I was told to wait for the next nights check-in at 12 and see the manager who would be able to assist me. So considering I already waited about 12 hours, I waited for the manager who refused to help anyone. There were a lot of people with similar problems. The manager told us to go to the Ethiopian office in Riyadh at 10am the next day to have new tickets reissued to us. So I was desperate and did so. On arrival I was greeted by more than 50 customers and only one officer to help us. Having already wasted two days at the airport, I decide this was enough and booked a flight on another airline and flew home to South Africa the next day. I have never experienced anything so horrifying in my entire life before. Not a soul can offer you an explaination or any reassurance, leave food or water or a place to rest and can you imagine having not slept in more than 24 hours. It was a disasterous occurrence that I wish never to experience again. To date I have contacted Ethiopian airlines customer services and compensation for this disastrous episode.

### "plane looked tired and faded"
Ethiopian is a very poor airline. Boarding in Nairobi was disorganized with no priority for Star Alliance Gold passengers. The plane looked tired and faded despite being a B737 with Sky Interior. The food was the absolute worst I've tasted on a plane: smelly, badly reheated and poorly plated with sauce dripping on the table. Arrival in Addis is a mess, with non-English speaking staff everywhere and poor signage. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "was quite disappointed"
Johannesburg to Tel Aviv via Addis Ababa. I was quite disappointed with the airline as a whole. They had sent me to the wrong boarding gate that was clearly printed on my boarding pass, which only later did I realise that they changed the gate without informing any one. The aircraft was not clean, there no was soap and toilet paper in most of the bathrooms. The aircraft was kept at a very low temperature and when I asked for blankets, they said that they don't have any. The service was poor, and they often took time to answer requests.

### "food was shockingly poor"
Los Angeles to Windhoek via Addis Ababa. This was my worst travel experience ever. Firstly, my baggage was left behind at Addis and it was only received two days after arrival without any  apology. The quality of food on flights out and inbound was shockingly poor. In terms of drinks served, besides the juices and soft drinks, the only available drinks were one red and one white wine. No beer or any other alcoholic beverages were available. The one toned music that was played on board irritated me to the hilt. Check in at Addis Ababa the most chaotic I have experienced. The cabin crew was very friendly and helpful.

### "combination of best and worst."
Addis Ababa to Paris. Ethiopian is a combination of the best and worst. The Boeing 787 from Addis Ababa to Paris was fairly new, with good lie flat seats and a clean cabin. The IFE was working, for once. Very nice cabin staff, very helpful and professional. On the negative side, Addis Ababa airport is still one of the worst in the world, with chaos and dirt everywhere. The lounges are only slightly better than in a US domestic airport and Ethiopian ground staff yell at passengers and rush them through the gates all the time. The  inflight catering is stale and poorly presented, far from business class standards, despite a recent revamp of the menus and plating. Ethiopian is an average airline that takes you from A to B, but do not expect a top notch inflight experience.

### "Service was very good"
Bangkok to Accra return via Addis Ababa. Good airline, very generous with toilet kits, food standard but nothing to write about, good Ethiopian wines and good coffee. Clean aircraft, comfortable seats, large choice of movies, nice blankets. Service was very good, very attentive but the flights were empty at 50 to 60% in business. All four flights were on time. A negative point with Ethiopian Airlines is that they are very restrictive on miles awards: I ended up getting zero miles. I accept their prices are quite low, but they could at least give mileage equivalent to economy class.

### "was comfortable and pleasant"
Singapore to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. At the airport, the queue was long and the wait was long. The flight was delayed for about an hour but we managed to make it on time to Addis Ababa Bole. The plane was clean and service was good. The food was delicious and they gave amenities such as eye mask, toothbrush/paste and socks. The journey was comfortable and pleasant. However, at Nairobi my luggage was not there so we had to file a missing luggage report which took an hour. The counter staff informed that there are 3 remaining flights from Ethiopia to Nairobi and For the next few days, I have been checking online on whether the luggage was located but the status was 'Tracing continues' which was bad news. I only received my luggage 4 days later which was quite disruptive to my plans. Although this was an unfortunate event, I was overall quite pleased with the way the staff handled the situation. On my return flight, the flight from Nairobi to Addis Ababa was delayed for 2 hours. This caused many passengers who had connecting flights in Ethiopia to miss their flights. Passengers were told to go to various counters with no one at the counters. I was lucky enough to catch my flight. However, the information on the board directed me to go to Gate 13. At Gate 13, we were then informed that it was at Gate 4 and many of us had to run to the other end of the airport. One lady politely told the ground staff that there could be quite a number of people still queueing at Gate 13 and something needs to be done so that these people wouldn't miss their flights but she was brushed off with a nonchalant attitude. Overall, the plane ride was smooth. However, there needs to be a huge improvement in ground staff service.

### "very poor service and poor quality"
Worst airline I have ever flown! We were delayed for 4 hours with no communication from ground staff. We were merely told to sit down every time we wanted to know why we were waiting. No access to even a drop of drinking water. The ground staff were extremely rude and would walk away while you were still talking to them. The food on the aircraft was disgusting, and I ended up not eating. The aircrafts are dirty and old with no inflight entertainment. This is the 3rd time in a row that they have lost my bags (I travel with them every 2 months) not by choice but my company books us on these flights. I received zero assistance regarding my bags, no phone calls or emails get answered and I'm told to go check every time an aircraft lands if my bags arrived. After a lengthy delay not even the crew could tell us why we were delayed (surely you should know as crew why you are taking off 4 hours late). Very unprofessional, very poor service and poor quality. Definitely do not recommend travelling with them unless you feel like sitting for lengthy periods waiting at airports not drinking even a glass of water, like people being rude to you, not eating your entire trip and feel like living off the bare minimum for a week because they loose you bag.

### "left me with a bad taste"
Paris to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. A chaotic check in experience for a packed flight at CDG. Boarding was supposed to be via zone, but when boarding time came at CDG it was every man for himself. Basically it was organized chaos. Passengers boarded with hand luggage that did not fit into the overhead compartments, and I ended up helping the cabin crew repack the compartments to fit everything in, as I am quite tall. The flight from CDG to ADD was the noisiest, smelliest flight I have ever been on, and 4 hours into the 6.5 hour journey, I wanted to use the toilet. The floor and toilet was covered in urine and toilet paper. I reported this to the cabin crew and nothing was done about it. The interior was the the most tired and dated I have been on, and my inflight entertainment was working on and off. Food service was abysmal, and after service the crew disappeared for the rest of the flight. The aircraft was quite dirty and one of the overhead bins opened in ADD when we were slammed into the ground upon landing. The leg from ADD to JNB was also in a 777-200LR, but on the upside it was quite empty. Meal service on this leg was a snack and a lunch and from all the meals this was passable. Service in general was OK, but nothing to rave about. In general the whole Ethiopian experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would suggest that the airline focus on customer service, and do something to fix abysmal ADD airport before they consider expanding further. A more modern cabin refresh wouldn't hurt either.

### "meal service was barely passable"
Disappointed with Ethiopian Airlines from Johannesburg to Paris via Addis Ababa. Check in at JNB went very smoothly. The equipment was changed from a 777-300ER to an A350. The aircraft was modern, but the Ethiopian interior made it look dated instantly. Overall seat comfort is acceptable provided the flight is empty. The cabin wasn't very clean, and meal service was barely passable. The Cabin Crew made up for the dismal food and drink by being friendly. Boarding at ADD was chaotic to say the least. Aircraft was a 787, and was in a generally good condition. Quite an empty flight, so you could stretch out. The meal served was exactly the same as on the previous leg. Initially I thought to give them a try as they seem to be on the up and up, but after this flight I will avoid them.

### "very happy with Ethiopian Airlines"
I traveled from Mumbai to Sao Paolo visa Addis-Ababa and back on end-May, Early June. I have to say that I am very happy with Ethiopian Airlines. The in-flight staff are friendly and courteous, the cabins well-maintained. But most importantly, the planes fly on time. Addis-Ababa airport is somewhat crowded but not quite as bad as most people make out to be. I think it is mostly the shock in comparison with swanky modern airports that catch people off-guard. But when you get over that the airport is actually function quite ok and the staff are by and large helpful. Particularly, if your stop-over is less that 3 hours, it is not a problem at all. For longer stop-overs the small size could make it a bit boring. For the Mumbai-Addis Ababa route the planes are either Boeing 777 or Boeing 737 when the number of passenger is less. The latter does not have personalized screen with every seat which is a negative. However, they play a movie on the common screen. On the Addis Ababa - Sau Paolo route the plane is Boeing 787 (Dreamliner). The food is sumptuous, but Ethipian could consider bring in some variety. On my way from Addis-Ababa to Sao Paolo the same meal was served on three occasions. Agreed that it is a relatively cheap airlines, but a little variety would not increase cost. On the whole I would fly Ethiopian again, and would recommend anyone who is not unnecessarily snooty about small things.

### "helpful and usually quite nice"
Kuala Lumpur to Addis Ababa. Ethiopian Airlines planes are modern but their interior is poorly maintained and IFE antiquated. Cabin staff are reasonably helpful and usually quite nice. There is a real problem with their meals -  uninspiring in Business and inedible in Economy, and it is getting worse despite their new catering facilities. Addis airport is being expanded and renovated but until then, it will remain one of the worst airports. Ethiopian will take you from A to B, similar to a budget airline in Europe.

### "choose Ethiopian, you choose Africa"
Dar es Salaam to Kuala Lumpur via Addis Ababa / Bangkok. I mostly fly with a bicycle (think of Pippi Longstocking). At Ethiopian Airlines you can't add special baggage online to your flight, even not attach a notice. But sports equipment is on their baggage scedule and a good fare for bicycles is given (100 USD for intercontinental flights). I went and booked from Tanzania (online), they have no call-center there, even Ethiopian is operating much from Dar es Salaam. An email to the airport office was not answered in 9 days. I called up to 8 telephone numbers before I reached somebody, who was kind, but don't understood what he should do with 'bicycle', while I wanted to go by aircraft. The clerk absolutely not knowed, how to book special baggege to a flight and what sports equipment should be. I should call the city office, where nobody answered the phone. The nearest callcenter in Addis Ababa not worked technically in Tanzania. So after 5 days with no success to get the bicycle on my flight, I visited the Ethiopian Dar es Salaam city office, where a very kind women tried to understand what I want, but after all not find any way to get the special baggage booked. After 1 day she wrote me a nice email, I should call the airport office, where another kind woman told me, she can't do anything, but I should simply bring the bicycle packed to check-in. They will take it in any case. At the check-in I was told, the packed bicycle is very welcome and will cost 250 USD. I referenced the website price of 100 USD, and the ground manager told me the bicycle are welcome, the cost is 200 USD, payable only cash. I was short in funds and so I had to organize Tanzanian Shilling from ATM. The only properly working international ATM at Julius-Nyerere-Airport was defect, so while check-in runs, I jumped with a taxi to the closest bank. The ground handling manager then took 500.000 Tanzanian Shilling, which are 223 USD (Mai 2017). The baggage (all within the limits) was proceeded and a view minutes later I got a receipt upon 200 USD received for excess baggage with many thanks. This is typical african and I found deals like that many times on my half year visit of north and east africa. The new old spirit. It is still less expensive as the excess baggage rates for bicycles at other carriers, but not the 100 $, which were wide spread for sports baggage intercontinental. On the other hand the flight was nice. I can't complain either the crew nor the aircrafts. The girls were nice and smiley and the jets clean, comfortable and fully functional, while in Africa on the ground nearly everything is dirty and disfunctional. For me, the crowd is also a part of flight quality. People, who complain the 'uneatable' meals on board never have been eating in Ethiopia. Compared with the food of simple people or what is served even in better restaurants, the onboard meals were luxury. They serve also Ethiopian beer which is very tasty. A bit disorganized Bole Airport (Addis). But in total it worked, many seats and loungers, fairly clean restrooms, shops with enough merchandise. No comparison to outside the airport. If you choose Ethiopian, you choose Africa.

### "the shock came in Addis"
Harare to Marrakech via Madrid. The flight from Harare to Addis was great. The shock came in Addis when flight ET712 to Madrid was overbooked. Upon checking in at Gate 9 (changed from Gate 1), the Ethiopian Airline officers stood three of us aside, apparently because our visa to Spain and Morocco had to be verified by a senior airline officer. Myself, a man from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a lady from Equatorial Guinea. During the check-in process, the man from the Congo protested fiercely, and was let in. As the queue died, we (me and the lady from Malabo) went to the boarding desk to get the EA senior to verify our VISA's to facilitate. The Ethiopian Airline officer handling the boarding looked aside and shouted, Boarding closed we will re-route you. The senior officer had not pitched up. No one had spoken to us. Nothing. I couldn't believe it that an airline would cook false stories to manage its own problem of overbooking. Fastforward to 02:00 Addis Time, 3 hours after the initial boarding time, we were still in their office and the lady from Malabo promised to get into another flight on Tuesday May 16th. I refused calmly and with smiles of spite. They tried to get me into ET702 to go to Morocco through Rome and i refused, returning their initial transit VISA lie that if i could not do a 60 minute transit to Morocco through Madrid, then i still could not take option of going through Rome, albeit 48 hours later. Later, another officer assisted by getting me proceed to Morocco by EgyptAir. His reason for my transfer "flight overbooked". And at this time I asked to see the Supervisor. The supervisor did not come. As this batch of officer's prepared to go home at 03h00, my AirEgypt flight to Cairo was also boarding. I left Addis without seeing the supervisor or getting the truth. I will not fly Ethiopian Airlines on my way back home.

### "surprised by the excellent service"
Rome to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. My wife and I recently travelled on Ethiopian Airlines and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent service. The hostesses were very helpful and the meals were very good. Addis Ababa airport is a bit crowded but an overall pleasant experience was had. It is truly value for money.

### "planes look worn"
Nairobi to Lagos via Addis Ababa. For a frequent flyer like me, Ethiopian Airlines is a default choice for travelling across Africa because of its extensive network and, credit where due, on time performance. The good stops here as it is decades behind the service level that a global standard airline (or even Kenya Airways) would offer. Boarding in Nairobi, Addis and Lagos was disorganized, with no separate lines for Gold / Business Class. Despite being new, planes look worn with unresponsive touch screens, very limited movie selection and poor quality earphones. Food was utterly inedible and the service protocol is weird - Ethiopian dishes are available on flights originating from Addis but not explicitly offered to passengers by the crew. Addis Ababa is the worst airport in Africa: dirty, poorly lit and completely overcrowded. The same goes for Ethiopian Airlines lounges. Avoid Ethiopian if you have another choice in Africa.

### "old, worn out aircraft"
Ethiopian Airlines has some very good aircraft but they deploy old, worn out aircraft into India. Seats are not clean and stained. The floor is littered and not cleaned well. The AC does not work properly. The meal portion is too small and not filling. In the 1.50 hrs Addis Ababa - Khartoum sector, they finished the meal service with a pocket size Burger and a fruit juice, that too at lunch time. Budget airlines are better. The Boeing 767 on Addis Ababa - Delhi is past its retirement age. It is clearly unfit and not airworthy. In flight service is just OK. No in flight entertainment - few common screens leave passengers with no choice but to see what is being displayed. Most ports for earphones in the seats do not work. While this airline has a large fleet of the B787, not sure why India isn't an important market for them. Miles to go.

### "not good communicating the reasons"
Kinshasa to Bangkok via Addis Ababa. I took this flight 3 time before as it is a good value for the money. The leg from Kinshasa was unfortunately done in an old B737 aircraft instead of the Boeing 787 as usual. The reclining seats were broken and the cabin old and filthy. The real problems started in Addis Ababa, first the departure (at 00:20am) of the Bangkok flight was announced to be delayed 1hr due to technical reasons then another hour and so on. The Ethiopian ground staff was not good communicating the reasons for the delay and to update the passengers. Finally the Business class passengers were allowed back into the lounge at around 2:30am. The flight finally got on its way at 7:00am.

### "old and tired 777"
Avoid Ethiopian Airlines at all costs. Flight from Nairobi to Addis Ababa was cancelled without any explanation and we were put on a later flight. Old and tired 777 with non responsive screens, smelly and hot cabin and very unfriendly cabin crew putting the seat backs in the upright position without any notice or word. Disgusting and badly warmed food - Ethiopian beats all other airlines I've flown on this point, including US airlines. Addis Ababa to Lalibela flight was supposed to be direct but a stopover in Gondar was added, again without any explanation. On the return flight, we were put on a 1-stop flight with a 4-hour layover in Axum, again with no explanation at all. The airport staff was completely unhelpful, stating that they were just doing their job and that they did not have to provide any explanation. Addis Ababa to Nairobi return flight on a tired 737 with torn seats and dysfunctional AC: the cabin was very hot throughout the flight and flight attendants just shrugged when told so. They even refused to provide a mother with a bassinet. Inedible food again - who serves cold shredded chicken with uncooked, bland rice and tomato sauce? Do not fly Ethiopian if you have a choice, do not believe their ads. Much better to pay the slight price difference and fly Kenya Airways or Middle Eastern airlines/Turkish Airlines if travelling across Africa.

### "Overall, functional service"
Brussels to Cape Town via Paris CDG/ and Addis Ababa. Check in at Brussels very smooth only a few passengers as main pick up at Paris CDG. According to seat map sites all economy had a/c power points though this is not true. I requested to use my cpap machine for sleep apnoea but my seat had no plug I was moved to bulkhead seat where there were 2 power points but 1 didn't work. Was told I may need to move at CDG if seat taken by young child and then turfed out when 1 elderly passenger sat in middle of 3. No help offered to find a seat but notice only first 4 rows from exit had power points. Found a spare seat but 2 of 3 plugs didn't work. IFE was ok but touch screen very poor and as logical as an old BlackBerry system. Big criticism leaving Paris CDG around 22.00 they served a full meal around 00.45 - why? Small sandwich & drink would do 1hr after take off. But worse, the cabin lights on full till 01.50 then back on at 15.20. Given Ethiopian Airlines don't give you eye masks it was impossible to sleep on this overnighter. Left Addis Ababa 1hr late as boarding seemed to be staff talking amongst themselves, the Boeing 777 leg was uneventful and comfortable thanks to 3-3-3 configuration and IFE slightly easier than 787. Overall, functional service, squandered overnight flight but worrying that not all seats have power but only half seem to work on a new aircraft

### "never again to fly with this airline"
❎ Unverified |  Washington to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. My family and I were on vacation and decided this time to use Ethiopian Airlines. We took advantage of travelling with our son who had not yet turned 2 years old and only paid for taxes for his flight. When the flight attendants started serving meals around the cabin flight, I was advised that they could not provide a meal for my son until they had served all the other passengers on the flight who had paid for their tickets. I was really caught unaware by this statement. I then shared my food with my son but vowed never again to fly with this airline. Their customer service is not very good at all. When we got to our destination in Kenya, two of our luggages were left in our connecting Airports in Addis Ababa. This just summed up my experience with this airline.

### "A350 plane shouted quality"
Cape Town to Addis Ababa on B777-200 went without issues, everything worked, cabin decor of light green gave impression of being faded, the plus was the 3-3-3 seat layout which gave more comfort than the Qatar 3-4-3. The weak point was the food which small and dull. Transit through Addis Ababa  was as bad as expected and I would not want to transfer here with my young family. The delays caused us a 1 hr delay on the ADD-LHR leg but we caught up 20min on the A350. Everything about this plane shouted quality even the IFE layout left the 787 behind though its so new the crew I don't think knew everything. During the flight I used my CPAP machine for my sleep apnoea and used the in seat power supply. The passenger next to me quizzed me about it asking if it used oxygen (which it doesn't).

### "check-in was unfriendly"
Ethiopian Airlines is growing very fast, but customer service doesn't grow at the same speed. Flew from Addis Ababa to Frankfurt. The check-in was unfriendly and I got the impression that as a Business Class passenger I was more of a disturbance to the check-in agent. Boarding was unfriendly, Business and Economy Class were treated the same. Ordered a special meal due to some food restrictions and was served food which I am not supposed to eat. Food presentation is poor, plated without any professionalism, just dumped on the plate and the food was not fresh. The main course was hard, fruits were spoiled. My neighbors seat was not properly functioning, my neighbor asked if she could use my charger. TV program and remote were not working property. In the bathroom the packets of paper tissues were still in the plastic wrap and they expected the business class passengers to open it. No proper amenities in the bathroom and soap dispenser was not working. Opted not to be disturbed for breakfast but they still woke me up. Requested four times for an additional Coca Cola Light and non of my requests were granted. The curtains was not closed between the galley and the cabin and the light shone into the cabin making it difficult to sleep. Ethiopian Airlines Business class is a better Premium Economy Class but not up to the standard of a Business Class but they still charge them same rates as other airlines.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Little did people know Ethiopian airlines does a direct fight between Hong Kong to Tokyo, and at a very reasonable price in both classes. I chose to fly their Cloud Nine business class, I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised from start to end. Cabin crew (some were even Chinese!) were charming, pro active. Frequent drink top up without even asking, lovely Ethiopian snack (kolo) was very delicious. Courses were served separately and all tasted wonderful, and in generous portions too. For this short 4 hour flight, they even gave away toiletry bag! 787 is a lovely plane to fly with, the air is much fresher and nice big window with a very cool dimming feature. Upon arrival, luggage were first off. Overall, it was a very good experience, on par with all the other big airlines serving this route.

### "Extremely competitive price"
Mumbai to Johannesburg return via Addis Ababa. Extremely competitive price (only Kenya Air was cheaper). Shortest flying time (since no direct flights). New aircraft. The first flight from Mumbai to Addis Ababa was delayed by maybe 30 mins, but they made up for the lost time on air and landed on time. Transit at Addis Ababa was the most unique and we did not even had to enter the terminal to board the next flight to Joburg. Flight to Joburg left on time and landed earlly. Both aircraft were Boeing 787's, food was decent and same with IFE. Return flight from Joburg was again ontime and an efficient 40 min transit in ADD. Aircrafts were Boeing 787 and 777. All in all, pleasant experience.

### "this flight was superb"
London to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian Airlines A350. Have been flying London to Addis on and off since 1970. This flight was the shortest ever at 6 hrs and 30 mins. Arrived in Addis 45 minutes early at 0545, great but too early to phone my wife or her driver. Good job I knew two folk on the flight to have coffee with in Bole Terminal 2 arrivals whilst we awaited dawn in Addis. This flight was superb. Check in at LHR using machine system. Very smooth at the gate, no queue at all. Fully boarded early. Main course at dinner was a very tasty Goan Fish Curry. Cabin staff their normal Ethiopian best.

### "thank you to the wonderful staff"
Hong Kong to Lagos return via Addis Ababa. The seats were comfortable and the food was lovely. Cabin staff were helpful and friendly. I had full assistance with wheelchair on my flights. Flight ET901 on 17th December 2016 landing in Lagos was the softest landing I ever had. We did not feel it touch down. So good in fact the people on the plane applauded. Returning Flight ET672 on 27th December was delayed from take-off due to bad weather so I missed my connecting flight to Hong Kong. Howevet no problems. I and the other people who had missed connections were booked into hotels throughout Addis Ababa. I got The Queen of Sheba hotel. Everything was free. The room, all meals and transfers to and from the airport. I'm looking forward to my next flight with Ethiopian Airlines later in the year to Nigeria again. Thank you to the wonderful staff who looked after me.

### "service was good, friendly and efficient"
2 hours delay at departure in Bangkok, due to non-functioning of the ticketing system, but I could get my connection in Addis and the luggage came on the same flight. Ethiopian now put the Dreamliner in service on the Bangkok-Addis route, a nice change from their old 767s. Meals are not really business class standard, and one of the 3 main dishes was not available on the Bangkok-Addis flight. The wine list is good, with some interesting and very exotic Ethiopian wines. Service was good, friendly and efficient. Seating on the 787 is standard 2-2-2 with full reclining sats, the cabin decoration non-existent. All in all, a good flight, especially taking into account that the ticket price is quite low.

### "overall very impressed"
Cape Town to Addis business class was a Boeing 787. Lounge in Cape Town is very nice, boarding was efficient and flight, seat and staff were all to high standard. The catering was average but acceptable. Addis Ababa to London the A350 was superior to Boeing 787. The only better seating setup I've experience is Qatar, easily better than Emirates business class seat. Addis Ababa transfer was quick and efficient. Lounge in Addis is basic but food was nice and it's clean and functional. All in all, Ethiopian Airways was half price of Emirates, Qatar and BA on same route. In most areas it's marginally below Emirates and Qatar but in some areas it's better (A350 is nicer set-up than Emirates 777, for example). On balance it's about 10-20% below Emirates, still excellent, but it's half the price. Overall very impressed, will fly Ethiopian again.

### "unexpected 24 hour visit to Ethiopia"
Kinshasa to Washington Dulles via Addis Ababa and Dublin. My Ethiopian Airlines flight departed Kinshasa 4 hours late and arrived at Addis Ababa 11:30 pm (local time) with hundreds of others passengers and no organized arrangements ready for us. Waited 2 hours and after getting a hotel voucher, I had to argue and demand my checked bag back for my unexpected 24 hour visit to Ethiopia. I was sent outside the airport at 2am (alone) with luggage to look for a hotel van that was not there but there were lots of locals trying to get me into their cabs. After 40 mins waiting, airline staff finally came outside and sent me to a different hotel whose van was there. Most passengers on this flight left their homes early in the morning in Kinshasa because it usually takes 3 hours to get to the airport from downtown in order to check in 2 hours before the flight. We were finally served a tuna sandwich and warm soda 3 hours after our scheduled departure time in the waiting area of the airport. 3 hours later and nearly 10 hours after leaving my home that morning I was finally given a meal on the plane with warm soda and no ice. According to the staff, the ice melted due to the delay and there was no ice for the entire flight to ADD. I hope this gives you a better understanding of the level of fatigue I had when we arrived at nearly midnight and that every minute of delay at the airport made things more difficult. I have never eaten dinner at 3 am in a hotel before. Returned to airport for my new flight home and my name was flagged for secondary security check where they proceeded to go through every item in my luggage and purse taking everything out (for the entire waiting area to see all of my personal belongings without any privacy). Of course I protested and demanded a supervisor who tried to blame the screening on the US government. I am a U.S. Diplomat and there were many of us on that flight. So when they tell me that the US government picked my name for secondary inspection - I am very qualified to know that was not a true statement. Finally onboard the flight to Washington, which is 8 hours to Dublin, 1 hour to refuel and then another 6 hours to DC.

### "clean cabin with a pleasant feeling"
Traveled in business class with Ethiopian Airlines as fares were so affordable I could not resist buying that. Checked in at Nairobi at the business class counters which was a pleasant experience. Flight from NBO-ADD was on time on a brand new A380. Clean cabin with a pleasant feeling. Food pre-ordered with one hot dish served. On reaching Addis disembarkation was without any hassles. ADD Airport was crowded with many transit passengers. Lounge was located on the other side of the boarding hall, whole lounge to ourselves like three persons. Special arrangements for serving Ethiopian Coffee in traditional way was another good experience. But food choice was not up to the mark in the lounge. Boarding experience on ADD-BOM leg was not so pleasant, complete havoc and looked like they merged two planes together / adjusted on delayed connecting passengers from different aircraft. Inflight services good but the way the drinks and juices are served is a little immature. Food served was great, a salmon steak. Seating quality was good in comparison to other aircrafts. Disembarkation at BOM was with out any big hassles and baggage services also needs to be addressed as baggage arrived after 35 minutes (Priority baggage).

### "inattentiveness of the staff"
Nairobi to Stockholm via Addis Ababa. Quite a pleasant flight in economy on Boeing 787, I was impressed with the meals - first time I've had Salmon as dinner. Quite the opposite in the older Boeing 767 used in Africa. One thing that struck me was the inattentiveness of the staff. Several passengers requested assistance by pressing the button during the flight but I never saw a single being attended to. I requested assistance but after ten minutes decided to walk into the galley myself to get something to drink. The thing that really is bad with Ethiopian is the transfer in Addis Ababa. This is one of the worst Airports I have been to and it really needs an upgraded terminal. A delayed flight by two hours in Addis Ababa with no information, quoted by pilot as being caused by Aircraft rotation, is also one reason I'm probably not using Ethiopian again.

### "decades behind its competitors"
Kuala Lumpur to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. Ethiopian Airlines looks like it's stuck between a no-frills and a full service airline model. Boeing 787s which already look worn (broken seat parts) even though they're modern with unresponsive IFE touch screens and a limited amount of entertainment. I heard that Ethiopian Airlines opened a brand new catering facility but they still serve the same awful tomato chicken and rice and industrial breakfasts with bright pink sausages. Such a shame for an airline that could represent Ethiopia's incredible culinary tradition. No inflight magazine available on any flight and night kits randomly distributed to a few passengers only - same goes for pillows and blankets. Boarding disorganized and chaotic with no separate line for Star Gold/Business class passengers. Bole airport is worse than ever with filthy toilets, overcrowded boarding areas and no wifi. The only nice thing is that both flights were on time, which is good enough. I have flown Ethiopian Airlines at least once a month in the past 3 years and despite its aggressive marketing campaigns, it provides a subpar service and is still decades behind its competitors in Africa such as Qatar Airways, Etihad, Emirates and Turkish Airlines.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Lagos to Los Angeles via Addis Ababa and Dublin with Ethiopian Airlines. I am a frequent flyer with Platinum Medaliion status with the Skyteam. So I am in a position to judge which service is good. I have never flown Ethiopian before 2017. My recent 25 hours plus flight was exceptional. They exceeded my expectations in every aspect. Equipment is modern and the B787 from ADD to DUB to LAX was fantastic. Food was great; courteous staff on the plane. Touch screen entertainment was superior to many other airlines I have flown. Only complaint I can say is the ground staff at the airport, maybe need a little more training on that end.

### "older planes, no individual screens"
Durban to Delhi via Addis Abba. Great and pleasant cabin crew. However, flight schedule was changed several times before I even went to the airport. Even at airport, gates frequently changed and transport to plane was by delayed buses. Cheap prices, average food, but older planes with no individual seat screens. Addis Abba airport badly in need of upgrade. First to have sleeper seats but old and crowded. A few shops selling Chinese goods in US dollars. Wanted to shower and change in washrooms after several overnight flights - too crowded to do so. Basement was pitch dark and freezing cold (exposed to the elements). Toilet was a temporary trailer with porta-potties. Strong smell and windows open so everyone in lounge can see and hear you. Supposedly loading by zones but first zone called and no other - everyone just queued up to get on helter-skelter. One problem was that they did not load the disabled first - one women had to get out of her wheelchair and queue up with regular passengers at plane entrance to get to her seat. Naturally, this was difficult for her and slow. Why they did not follow other airline's policies and load the disabled and families with small kids first is beyond me. They certainly saved no time in doing so and caused great stress to the disabled as many had limited mobility.

### "incompetent, rude and unhelpful"
Dubai to Durban via Addis Ababa. This was the worst experience I have ever had on an airline. The flight from Dubai to Addis Ababa was set to arrive in Addis at 07h55. The boarding time was 07h45 and the plane departed at 08h30. Based on these times alone, it was an impossibility that we would catch the connecting flight - they could not give us a reason for the late departure. My husband and I (and many other passengers) expressed their concern to cabin crew that we would not make our connecting flights. We were assured that the captain had communicated with ground staff and that our plane was waiting for us. We arrived in Addis and were escorted to a bus. We were then told to stand in a queue. When we asked why we were in a queue and not boarding our plane we were stared at blankly. We (and about 30 other people) soon realised that the planes that were "waiting for us" had all departed. We finally got to the front of the queue after waiting for about 50 minutes and were told we would just have to wait until the flight the next day. This was Christmas Eve. After much argument, my husband turned on his roaming and found a flight that day. The people behind us piped up and said they also wanted that flight. The staff grabbed all our passports into a bundle and came back with two tickets for the people who had pushed in front of us and said they only had two tickets so we would have to wait until the next day! The staff were incompetent, rude and unhelpful. We stood there for about 2 hours trying to get them to help us. They would go and hide in the corner so they didn't have to help us. When the manager finally arrived he was unapologetic and incompetent. When we complained that we couldn't only get to Durban late on Christmas eve instead of on 23rd they said "well then you can fly on Christmas day". We asked about compensation for our car hire and hotel in Durban that we were missing and were laughed at. The gentleman in front of us was offered another flight on 26 December. We ended up having to stay in Addis overnight and take 2 connecting flights to get to Durban on the evening of Christmas Eve. They took another hour to find our luggage for the "hotel". The hotel they put us in was dirty, had power cuts, the elevator didn't work and hotel staff walked into our room 3 times without so much as a knock saying "oh, I thought you had left" or "oh, someone is in here". The bathroom had cockroaches and we were given no monetary compensation. The way that Ethiopian Airlines staff treated us was the worst part, as if it was a joke that we were missing precious time with our families. I tried to call Ethiopian Airlines in South Africa on about 8 different numbers to cancel our return flight and get a refund. The numbers either cut out or just rang. I eventually had to turn on roaming and called the Ethiopia office. I was put on hold for 30 minutes and then told he couldn't help me and I should call South Africa. I told him that no one answers and he said he didn't know then. We physically went into the office in Cape Town and canceled our return flights on 28 December 2016. We are still waiting for the refund! Addis Ababa airport is dirty and disgusting. The toilets are worse than festival toilets and their duty free doesn't have working card machines. I complained at first that Emirates were too expensive but now realise that you get what you pay for. You couldn't pay me to fly Ethiopian airlines again, the worst airline.

### "we were pampered"
Compared to my outbound flight I had a pleasant inbound flight back to Bangkok. NSI-ADD leg was in economy class and ADD-BKK in business. The economy service was decent even though the junior FA (sticker attached on their uniform) had a hard time smiling, I assumed the stress must be the cause but no complaints, the service was fine. The free seating out of NSI went without issue. In business class, great service. Very attentive FA. Only about 6 pax in the whole cabin so we were pampered. I slept all the way after the meal until landing. I had my best ever 2 glasses of orange juice, I wonder if it was the altitude but the juice was so fresh that I asked for 2 servings.

### "lie flat seats, helpful staff"
Dubai to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. Another successful flight from Ethiopian. Cloud Nine business classis great, with ie flat seats, helpful staff and lovely food. On the leg to Cape Town they did a trolley service with a selection of Ethiopian dishes - delicious. They are obviously so proud of their nation - that comes across in their service. I had a very tight connection in Addis - just 35mins. We landed and I was on the connecting plane in 15 mins! That is because they want it to happen. As the plane land came to a stop the stairs pulled up, the coach arrived and someone asked where you were connecting to. Whisked away on the coach to be met in the terminal by someone else asking where we were going. She asked me to wait to one side and then took me directly to the Cape Town plane in seconds - everyone else had already boarded and I took my seat. Both planes left on time and arrived either on time or a little early. I had booked in economy but chose their option to choose a price to upgrade. I chose the lowest offered and was successful. It was a wonderful start to 2017 - thank you Ethiopian.

### "travelling thru Addis Ababa is a challenge"
Juba to Stockholm via Addis Ababa. I choose Ethiopian Airlines when I get a reasonable ticket price, as I find travelling via Addia Ababa can be a bit of a challenge. This trip started in Juba, South Sudan that is an airport of itself, not an easy one to travel through. I checked in day before and got for the first leg the seat 27C, only to find out on board there was only 25 rows. However there was empty seats so no big deal. The catering on the flight tough was a real disappointment, before we used to get a decent sandwich and a dink service. This time it was a box containing a napkin, a small bottle of water and a minimal piece of bread. No drink trolley was seen. To their advantage we departed 30 minutes early tough. Next leg Juba to Stockholm as at 2355 and i had a good 4 hours in Addis to spend the time. Gate on my boarding pass was shown as number 9 but on the airport screens I could read number 12. Closer to the departure I went towards gate 12 but me and a number of fellow passengers for the flight was shown to gate 10. So after security check I went to gate 10 but was told to proceed to gate 12 via a locked glass door 'somebody will open it later'. After some time we were some 50+ people waiting for the door to be opened when a ground staff came and directed us to gate 1 in the other end of the terminal in the basement. The basement area was almost pitch black (no power), and gate 1 was already full of people, but I heard a voice in the darkness calling Rome and Stockholm passengers to go to gate 6. The confusion was close to a Jacque Tati movie but at the same time I found it quite amusing. Others did not. Eventually we boarded and the flight departed only some 30 minutes late to Stockholm via Rome. Flight was close to full on both sectors, service good and food acceptable. And to my surprise we arrived Stockholm 30 minutes early so I guess there is some margin in the schedule. Generally I find their cabin crew quite good and accommodating, Food between bad and average but travelling thru Addis Ababa is really a challenge at times. The company should have improved Bole transit and departure areas long time ago, as it can be a real struggle passing thru. I can recommend Ethiopian Airlines to experienced and somewhat hardened travelers that do not expect what the commercials are telling you. It can be really okay, but also be quite of a roller coaster. If the price is right I may go for ET again, but if I get a better competitor for a similar price the option is obvious. If you are a first time traveler to Africa you may think twice about the flight options.

### "extremely good value for money"
Mumbai to Sao Paulo via Addis Ababa, with a stop in Lome. I was very pleasantly surprised at the excellent quality of service, the cabin service and extremely good value for money. The ADD to GRU leg was very good, with three full service meals provided in Economy class. The food quality was excellent and with real portions of real food, all well prepared. The flight crew were very efficient and pleasant without being over-smiling. The Boeing 787 is an excellent aircraft, the lighting ambience and polarised windows are a first class innovation. The transfer in ADD was exceptional given the limited facilities at the airport. There must have been 25 planes working at an airport quarter the size of a small regional airport, somehow they coordinated the whole thing without the drama so frequently encountered at European and N American airports. Well done Ethiopian!

### "no recourse from airline"
Washington to Blantyre via Addis Ababa. Stranded with no recourse from airline. Booked tickets in May for travel in December. Tickets paid for and confirmed, yet prior to travelling they cancelled reservation for one leg of the journey. Called agents and they informed me that they cancelled reservation but unable to give answer as to why they cancelled reservation. Finally got rebooked after four phone calls but still on waiting list for last leg of journey. Called again and they say no seats available. Went online and I can clearly see seats available and am able to book on the final leg myself. Informed Ethiopian Airlines of the seat availability and they said they will see what they can do. Nothing done to resolve problem. Encountered many lies from agents, they will inform that they will call you back but dont have your hopes up for this, they will never call you. If you call to follow up be prepared to be disconnected for no reason. Also remember according to them, it's never their fault. If anything goes wrong with booking you will suffer because the reservations agents are incompetent and unwilling to resolve problem. No one can explain how a confirmed booking can be cancelled yet the same journey can be repurchased online again, so flights were not cancelled but reservation cancelled for a phantom reason. After desperation, I ended up paying for another ticket, which is much easier to do than to deal with the airlines agents. Pay a little more and travel another airline, its not worth being stranded in another country and the airline will not do anything about it. I would understand if flights get cancelled but clearly not the case in this situation.

### "not recommend Ethiopian Airlines"
Newark to Douala via Lomé. I flew from to US to spend Christmas Eve and day with my parents in Douala, Cameroon. The disorganization started in Newark where we had a 2 hours delay. The boarding took at least an hour, with several customers having the same seat number! When we finally took off, a lot of customers, including me, had concerns about missing their connection. We were assured that connecting flights will wait for this flight to land. Well, when we landed, I asked if the flight to Douala left, they said 'no'. The crew at the Airport had prepared boarding passes for all connecting passengers. Mine and several were not printed. They asked us to wait, and be patient. 2 hours later, with the patience gone, we were told we did not have a reservation, the flight was full, and left. No consideration whatsoever to listen to us, no compassion at all for passengers who will be spending Christmas away from families. No apologies at all. I'm currently in an hotel, waiting for the next flight on the 26th, no guarantees I'll have a seat. I'd not recommend Ethiopian Airlines at all.

### "cannot recommend Ethiopian Airlines"
Frankfurt to Lilongwe via Addis Ababa and Dar es Salaam. Flights were all in all okay, but when I arrived in Lilongwe, one piece of luggage was (and still is) missing. I reported the loss immediately at the airport in Lilongwe and got a "Property Irregularity Report". Despite this, many calls to the airport, visits to the airport, many calls to all sorts of phone hotline, many e-mails, even letters sent by regular mail, so far nothing has happened. The airline is silent, no reaction at all. The loss is above 1.100 EUR. Such service is unacceptable for a member of the Star Alliance. I cannot recommend Ethiopian Airlines at all.

### "similar to a budget airline"
I flew Ethiopian Airlines twice so far from Toronto to Yaounde and from Singapore to Yaounde. I paid an upgrade to business class on the BKK-ADD leg and flew ADD-NSI on Y. Business class service is 3 Star and not more, food quality is so-so for business class. Champagne was served though. Flight attendant in business class are attentive. Limited choice on the onboard IFE. Cabin wasn't that clean on any of the flights. The inbound flight to BKK was coming from KUL when we boarded in BKK so it wasn't refreshed. I am quite disappointed to that Ethiopian has such a poor service for a Star Alliance company. They must do something to improve their service. Service is similar to a budget airline.

### "the staff were top notch"
Abuja to London via Addis Ababa. The first surprise was the size of Boeing 777-200LR which was used between Abuja and Addis Ababa. Plane was very spacious and neat. The staff were top notch and very nice. The trip from ADD to LHR was equally impressive. Nice plane (an A350), brilliant in-flight entertainment and crew were spot on. Only for some funny reason, the cabin was kind of hot. Would also recommend that Wifi should be introduced on their long haul flights.

### "new A350 plane impressive"
A round trip from Cape Town to London via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. On the link between Addis and London was on their new A350 plane. V impressive, quiet spacious, with good space and excellent entertainment system. The other leg Cape Town to and from Addis was on the B767. Less impressive, more cramped, noiser with limited entertainment - still seat back but tiny. Service on all legs was excellent. Friendly and helpful staff with good information and announcements. Food ok - I asked for a special meal and was provided. Transit at Addis is straightforward. You can be directed right into the waiting area. If you are remember no facilities here apart from toilets and seats. It does get very crowded especially if you are in the area for gates 1-7 in the International terminal which uses buses to and from the gates. But organised in that announcements are made and there are good screens showing the information. If you are a premium customer or Star Alliance Gold but travelling economy you can use a separate area in that section - comfortable chairs, water and separate buses. Ethiopian do look after regular travellers and their premium customers. Their prices are often the cheapest between southern africa and Europe. Give them a go if on a budget but be prepared for a transit in Addis that doesn't have all the creature comforts you might want so try and keep transit times to a minimum. I have a few more trips lined up with them in the coming months and will look forward to travelling with them again.

### "problems started on the way back"
Round trip from Tel Aviv to Sao Paulo via Addis Ababa. The quality of the journey was way different between the flight forth and the flight back. The first, was a very nice experience highlighting a very kind onboard service and amazing aircraft (Addis Abeba - Sao Paulo by a Boeing 787). But problems started on the way back. First, the aircraft was changed without any previous notification. The original flight was supposed to be flown also by a Boeing 787 but instead aircraft was changed to an old and dirty Boeing 777-2. I received an aisle seat which was pretty broken: the control panel on the handrail was destroyed and the touch-screen did not react to tact, but it had to be controlled by the broken panel on the handrail. Besides I stand up to the bathroom in 3 occasions during the flight while in all of them the lavatories were stinky and disgusting. Unfortunately, problems did not finish there since my bag was mistreated during the journey resulting in a broken wheel and the handle which was very hard to lift. On my arrival to the Airport in Tel Aviv I approached Aerohandling counters (the company handling Ethiopian Airlines in-land services at TLV), I was attended by a very rude man, and I was denied service while I was given a letter saying that the company will not be responsible for the damage caused to my luggage. I sent several e-mails to the company complaining about this situation until they finally answered. They promised they will respond for the damage caused to my belongings also promising that I will be contacted by the company. Several days later (around 10) I'm still waiting to be contacted.

### "disappointed by Ethiopian Airlines"
Delhi to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. Horrible experience and pretty disappointed by Ethiopian Airlines. The Delhi to Addis route was just horrible. 3x3 configuration for a 7 hour flight. On top of that, no personal inflight entertainment. There was just a screen which used to come down and then go up. The funniest part was that we were served the same food on all flights and there were only 2 cabin crew in the Delhi to Addis route who didn't just care about the passengers. The toilets were dirty and the cabin was not clean as well. Addis Airport was a huge disappointment. The staff were rude and always tried to shoo the passengers from the duty free area. Just avoid Ethiopian Airlines.

### "the worst customer service"
Addis Ababa to Windhoek with Ethiopian Airlines. One of the worst customer service experience ever encountered. On 7th November, 14 people missed a flight from Addis Ababa to Gabone/Windhoek because there was no bus driver on the bus that we were told to board. A driver finally came 5-10 minutes later, but he had no clue where the airplane was and simply drove us in a circle around the airport before arriving back at the departure gate. It took 30 more minutes for them to admit that the plane had already left as the airline does not have policy of counting passengers in the plane. Ground staff/customer service agents also admitted to their mistake. We have booked 2 Ethiopian Airlines flights and both times this has happened. The first time we got lucky as more than 20+ people got stuck in the airport in Zanzibar for a flight from Zanzibar to Addis Ababa. This time we were not so lucky. Compensation for more than a day and a half of lost time, hotel bookings and lost meetings? Initial offer: Nothing except an economy class re-booking on a later flight about 15 hours later. Subsequent offer: After much haggling a $300 voucher or $150 cash even though we had asked what is considered a reasonable request of $200 cash. However, two things to note about the offer. First no passengers were able to get the cash in Addis Ababa as the customer service officers claimed to not have cash on hand. Second the voucher is less valuable than the cash as you must buy the tickets through the airline ticket office which is often at least $150 higher than any ticket you would buy online. The customer service also used a stalling tactic by handing us off from one officer to the next. After 9 hours of waiting an agent finally came that told us they would come back within 10 minutes so that people could receive their cash and concerns would be addressed. However, no one showed up for another few hours giving only a half hour before boarding in which they claimed that there was no cash available because they do not handle money. One last thing to note is that of the 12 passengers that were routed to Windhoek (Namibia) via Johannesburg from Addis Ababa 4 of these passengers did not board the early morning flight on Air Namibia flight that Ethiopian Airlines had said they had booked from Johannesburg to Windhoek. Upon arrival at the transit desk the officer for Air Namibia stated that the tickets were either not booked or canceled. In the end the customer service people aggravated 14 customers who likely now will try to avoid flying Ethiopian Airlines whenever possible. If a company is professional this handling of customer service issues would never make good business sense.

### "did an excellent job"
For us, the return flight from Dublin to Los Angeles was very good, and Ethiopian did an excellent job. Their fare was unbelievably low (seriously! ), their service was good (cabin staff were all very friendly), and any delays were minor (the route starts in Addis and picks up people in Dublin, so there is usually a 30 min delay). If you are someone who is happy to fly Aer Lingus, US Airways, United, Delta, etc to the USA, then Ethiopian (on this route anyway) are well able to match them. And the Boeing 787 on the route is an added bonus! In terms of improvements they could make, the food could be better and the in-flight entertainment needs to be expanded.

### "never will I fly Ethiopian Airlines again"
Kuala Lumpur to Dar Es Salaam via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. On way back, my flight was changed to another flight departing 3 hours later without any prior warning. Same was done for a lot of other passengers in my original flight. This caused a lot of confusion at the check in counter. They gave us a food coupon. The food coupon could not be used at any outlet in the airport as none of the outlets acknowledged the coupon from Ethiopian Airlines. The layover in Addis Airport was the worse I have ever encountered anywhere. No place to sit, bathrooms were stinking and the smell came drifting outwards to the boarding gates. Never ever in my life will I fly Ethiopian again.

### "handling was completely ridiculous"
London Heathrow to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. Horrendous experience. 21:00 flight was cancelled due to a technical fault with the plane, passengers were taken to a holiday inn at 22:00. The airline attempted to book guests into shared rooms until obviously they objected. Guests were finally in single rooms by 2:00am. The airline promised to deliver the in flight meals to the hotel rooms, they did not. At 8:20am guests were called to return to the airport for a rescheduled 10:50am flight. On arrival at the departure gate, the screen announced that this flight was also now delayed until 12:00pm. No airline staff were around for information or reassurance. Flight finally departed and arrived at the scheduled destination >24 hours later. This resulted in the loss of an entire day, loss of a nights paid accommodation and loss of tour bookings. The flight was sub-standard with no working in flight entertainment and uncomfortable seating. I appreciate faults happen, but the handling of the situation was completely ridiculous.

### "very pleasant experience"
My first experience on a Boeing 787 of Ethiopian Airlines and it was a very pleasant experience. I was going to Seychelles from Milan via Addis Ababa. I wasn't truly convinced I have to say, but facts proved me wrong! I was in the Business Class. Food was delicious, the flight was really confortable, seats and everything and the hostess on board kind for all the needs. The flight was on time so I'm really keen to fly again with Ethiopian Airlines in the foreseeable future.

### "no apologies onboard from anyone re the delay"
Just returned from a short trip Tel Aviv - Addis Ababa - Kinshasa - Addis Ababa - Tel Aviv. Unfortunately Ethiopian Airlines is always a let down in one way or another. I believe this will be my last trip with them. Its back to AF/KL/BA/LH. The way over was great, B738 TLV to ADD, friendly crew, good food, comfortable bulkhead seat and nice music channels. Addis Bole airport is an insult to ET and Star Alliance. Crowded, dirty, disgusting bathrooms, chaotic boarding procedures. The B772 to FIH was empty, so I had 3 seats for myself and the crew were friendly (all females). The return trip was a very different story, it's where ET fails in every aspect of service. I had a reserved seat FIH-ADD, emergency exit, as I need leg room to avoid back pain and free access to the bathroom. Of course ET changed equipment at the last minute to B738, I lost my good seat and on top of it a two hour delay in Kinshasa due to the Aircraft change. No word from the local staff re the delay, no word about AC change, I had to struggle with a most unfriendly agent to get an aisle seat. No apologies onboard from anyone re the delay, not the Captain nor the Inflight manager. I guess passengers should expect to lose their long time assigned seats, spend hours waiting and get zero 'sorry'. One Cabin crew member was great when I told her my story, she was apologetic, sincere and warm. When landing in ADD, passengers started opening overheads while in taxi, left them open so items could fall and injure passengers. The crew did nothing to stop this. Again Bole airport a crowded dirty mess, the flight to TLV was late one hour without any explanation, I guess it's the norm at ET. The only shining Star at ET is their cabin crew. I made it home safely and that's all that counts.

### "if you don't care about service"
Luanda to Hong Kong via Addis Ababa. The aircraft leaving luanda was a very nice Boeing 777, it was good for the money spent. Arriving at Addis Ababa its was a long wait till my flight for Hong Kong, the transit area was really bad no place to rest and food court was really terrible. Next flight on a Boeing 767, the seats were really cramped and the  entertainment system was awful, food service was so bad. They lost my luggage and apparently I was not the only one. I got my luggage only 1 week later, had to buy clothes in Hong Kong to cover up their mess. If you want a cheap flight and don't care about service you can pick Ethiopian Airlines.

### "flight was delayed over four hours"
In short, my flight was delayed over four hours due to mechanical problems, including with the plane's landing gear. The service from all members of staff we encountered was dismal. My flight was scheduled to depart Addis Ababa at 12.50am and arrive in Vienna at 5.50am. At Addis Ababa, we were directed to one entrance for security screening, whereupon staff closed the doors in our faces and directed us to a second entrance, the second entrance directed us back to the first entrance, we were then directed to a third entrance, where we waited a while, until being redirected to a fourth entrance. After boarding, we sat in the plane for forty five minutes before being told that the landing gear was broken. After another half an hour we were told that the air conditioning was also broken. The heat was sweltering. After a full hour and forty five minutes of this heat, the air stewardesses thought to bring us water. A stewardess handed the last cup to the passenger beside me, looked at me, then returned to the back of the plane. I pressed the call button three times over fifteen minutes. There were several other passengers also using their call buttons. Because I was sitting at the very back of the plane, I could hear the stewardesses chatting and laughing behind me. Finally I got out of my seat, walked past the stewardesses sitting around doing nothing, and poured myself a cup of water. In the end, the flight departed over four hours late, meaning that I missed connecting flights from Vienna to London and London to Montreal. In total I was in transit for 50 hours, rather than 38. I spoke to the airline's representative company, Celebi, in Vienna airport. Celebi provided me with accommodation and meals, but told me to call Ethiopian Airlines on the subject of further compensation. I called Ethiopian Airlines, and was told to talk to Austrian Airlines. I spoke to Austrian Airlines, who informed me that because the flight was operated by Ethiopian Airlines, I must speak to Ethiopian Airlines. I called Ethiopian Airlines again and it was confirmed to me that this was correct, but that I must contact Ethiopian Airlines via email. I did so and have been waiting almost a month for a reply.

### "experience is horrible"
Cotonou to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. The Ethiopian Airlines experience is horrible from one end to the other. ✅ Verified Review | Chaotic boarding in Cotonou, plane 45 minutes late with no apologies from the crew. No earphones distributed at any point for the entertainment system and not even an inflight magazine. Do not let Ethiopian’s ads on their new fleet fool you - planes (737s with Sky Interior in this case) are not properly looked after. On the Cotonou-Addis flight, there was fruit jam on the tablet and chewing-gum in the seat pocket. The seat covers were worn and falling apart. The overhead screens were not working and kept coming up and down. Very slow service with disgusting food and it took the crew about an hour and a half to clear the trays. Addis Ababa airport is a horrific place. Overcrowded, dirty, smelly (especially since the smoking areas do not close hence people smoke outside). The shops are a disgrace, with no fixed prices and people haggling over the price of items. Most items are just lying on the floor or on broken shelves, still in their delivery packages. Credit card payments did not work in two duty free shops out of three. The Ethiopian/Star Alliance Gold lounge is dark, dirty and has a very limited food choice. When I entered nobody was at the reception to scan my boarding pass. It is usually impossible to find a seat available in the evening. Better to stay outside and sit on the floor. The toilets, both in the lounge and outside, are dirty and smelly. Ethiopian Airlines ground staff are impolite, permanently yells at passengers to rush them to the gates and does not answer questions when asked something. Be careful as flights are not announced or the general chaos can lead one to miss the boarding announcements and therefore, the flight. Addis-Nairobi was similarly terrible, with tired seats (despite the young age of the aircraft, another 737 with Sky Interior). It was once again 45 minutes late with no apologies whatsoever. No earphones or inflight magazine, once again. No pre-take off checks, most people had their seatback down and/or were using laptops and electronic devices. Food very bad, with crew throwing the tray on the tablets saying “chicken” and again, the overhead screens were dysfunctional. I should also mention that at no point in Cotonou or Addis were there separate queues for Business/Gold members and Economy passengers during boarding, with disorganised queues, staff yelling in every direction and in general, a sense of squalor. It is a real pity to be sometimes forced to use Ethiopian Airlines because of the lack of competition in African skies. Avoid at all costs and prefer Kenya Airways whenever possible.

### "I didn't expect such poor service"
Harare to London Heathrow via Addis Ababa. Appalling to say the least. Ethiopian may have new aircraft but don't let this fool you. On the HRE-ADD sector I had to tell the cabin crew to issue an infant seat belt to someone travelling with an infant seated adjacent to me, this being after two cabin crew walked through to secure the cabin. The senior crew member left the trolley unattended in the middle of the cabin during the flight to help a colleague for a good 5 minutes. The crew had zero personality, and even asked 'what does she want' to a pax sat next to the pax the crew member was referring to. They did not offer a choice of meal and instead just said 'chicken' and dumped the tray on my table. I requested fish, she returned with a meal that had fish written on the lid but was actually vegetarian inside. There was no apology, just no personality with any of the crew on all four sectors. Credit where due, one meal was edible, the rest were cold and under cooked on all sectors. Out of all four sectors, I was only able to check in and choose my seat on one. Addis Ababa airport is dismal. They are seemingly meant to be upgrading the airport. I tried to buy a sandwich with my card but couldn't because the system was down. Security is horrendous. I am all for safe flying given the current times but you will need to allow at least an hour to pass through security as they then do a passport check - and don't take any duty free liquids as these are confiscated. I was reluctant to travel with Ethiopian Airlines  more on a safety level but had minimal choice as Emirates was full. I didn't expect such poor service as well.

### "Ethiopian was a huge disappointment"
Flying with Ethiopian was a huge disappointment. The aircraft from Addis to Stockholm was a new Boeing 787, but the entertainment system was down during the entire flight. Our departure from Addis was delayed by one hour as the ground crew tried to fix the system, but without success. The cabin crew were arrogant and inattentive. They simply did not respond to calls. At one time I could see 18 unanswered calls in business class only. I had to physically stop the cabin attendants to get their attention. They apologized to me but left all the other calls unattended. The food was tasteless and boring. For breakfast we got a terrible lukewarm Pizza. We had ordered kids meals for our children, but the cabin attendants did not know this so we had to tell them to bring the right meals. Eventually we just found out that the kids meals hardly differ from the adult meals. A major drawback of Ethiopian is that many connections mean changing flights in Addis Ababa. The airport is dirty (especially the toilets) and totally overcrowded. Passengers are only allowed to enter the waiting areas 90 minutes prior to the flights. Until then they have to wait in the general terminal and sit on the floor just to see all the empty chairs in the closed waiting area. Also the restaurant are owercrowded, overpriced and have unpolite staff. I will avoid Ethiopian in the future.

### "airline exceeded our expectations"
My family flew with Ethiopian Airlines in July from Dublin to Los Angeles and return the trip was excellent. The airline exceeded our expectations - the legroom on the plane was the best I've ever seen in economy on transatlantic flights. The food was of good quality too. The airline staff were very attentive and nothing seemed to be a problem. I would recommend and would have no problem flying with them again.

### "knows how to look after their customers"
I flew with Ethiopian Airlines (Los Angeles to Dublin return) in October 2015 and June 2016 and all 4 flights were excellent. I must say that every single member of staff I encountered from reservations, check-in, boarding, inflight and disembarking were very welcoming, helpful and friendly and all seemed to be 'happy' in their jobs which I find rare in the airline industry in this day and age. The plane was very spacious and legroom is the best I have experienced on transatlantic flights. I found the food very good with a great choice of meals offered and being able to have a 'free' wine (or two) with dinner a nice touch. In October 2015 Ethiopian Airlines was the only airline offering direct flights from Los Angeles to Dublin and although Aer Lingus started operating a direct flight in May 2016, I found that ticket prices for Ethiopian Airlines were almost half the price of Aer Lingus flights for the dates I was looking for. Also on the return flight from Dublin to Los Angeles in October 2015 that although we were told on check-in that there was going to be up to an eight hour delay in departing, all customers were looked after very quickly and very efficiently by friendly staff and within half an hour, we were being taken to a nearby 4* Hotel, treated to full breakfast and lunch in the hotel before being picked up and brought back late afternoon for departure - that to me is proof that Ethiopian Airlines knows how to look after their customers. I am happy to fly 'home' to Ireland with Ethiopian Airlines anytime.

### "seats are very uncomfortable"
Group of 7 - 4 adults and 3 kids travelled from India Mumbai on the 13 July 2016 to Durban SA via Addis Ababa. We left India late, arrived late for the connecting flight - transported out of the incoming plane into a bus that took us directly onto our connecting plane, we never went into the terminal building. No inflight entertainment for 5.5 hours (except for music via broken head sets). On board we found that our seats had been given to other passengers by the inflight staff - everyone had to be put into their correct seats - some of us were not seated when the plane started moving. The toilets were dirty (not by current passengers) had not been cleaned from the previous flight. Food was poor - beef being offered to passengers who dont eat beef. While serving drinks ice was dropped on my wife. The seats are very uncomfortable, torn and dirty the head rests had grease/oil on it (the cover) like it was had not been changed from the previous flight. We arrived in Durban but our baggage still has not.

### "gracious, kind and attentive"
I flew a round trip from Dublin to Los Angeles with Ethiopian Airlines and would rate them top notch. The price was extremely competitive, the service on-board very efficient, flight attendants were outstanding - very gracious, kind and attentive. The food was quite nice, the aircraft was clean and so were the toilets. The seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room. The in-flight entertainment was great with lots of choice. All in all, I would say that this was one of the best flights I've been on in a long time. The fact that it is direct makes a big difference too.

### "toilets and galleys dirty"
Cape Town to Bangkok via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. Competitively priced. Addis gates holding area dirty and uncomfortable. All 4 flights were late to take-off (1-2 hours). 3 of the 4 flights the airconditioning on the plane was inadequate and could not be improved despite asking staff. Not sure if this means it is broken. Only the final leg from Addis to Cape Town was a pleasure and a comfortable temperature. The other legs had to be endured. Toilets and galleys dirty. Seats tired. Cracked tray table, broken seat pocket. Stark contrast to Bangkok Airways who were determined not to be late so were waiting for us when we arrived late from Addis and escorted us through security and passport control to the clean comfortable plane to ensure we did not miss it or delay the flight. I do not intend to fly with Ethiopian again.

### "the good started and ended there"
London Heathrow to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. This was my first time flying with this particular Star Alliance member, Ethiopian Airlines, through our Aeroplan points. It started off great. The staff are super friendly and helpful and throughout the whole thing the flight attendants in particular were amazing. The good started and ended there. After electrical malfunctioning of the plane we waited on board for 4.5 hrs before being told to disembark due to the difficulties the plane was having. Then we were told a new flight would be scheduled for us in the morning. The catch? No hotels could be provided due to no availability. They provided camping mats and thin blankets for us to sleep on the floor of the terminal. We missed all our connecting flights and needed a way to get to BFN in time to attend a meeting. Trying to get information out of anyone in order to get our bags and cancel our tickets was impossible even with the help of the Heathrow Information people (who were extremely nice, and tried to be helpful as possible), and other airport staff getting involved. While waiting for the luggage we requested back we watched the poor staff try and maintain order to a very angry group of people storming the gate. Even after the make up flights departure time we still had to wait a horrendous amount of time to get our luggage. This flight, ET701, was a joke.

### "had no major concerns"
Dublin to Los Angeles with Ethiopian Airlines. The service was good. The plane could do with better cleaning when connecting in Dublin, but fine - food wasn't 100% but is it ever. Was great getting two suitcases each when traveling to the USA. Would travel again and had no major concerns, very reasonable prices.

### "seats were old and in disrepair"
Flew Ethiopian Airlines from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. Check-in was swift as was the passport check at Addis airport. I was flying with a *A Gold Card holder and so was able to use the ‘Cloud Nine’ lounge at Addis. This lounge falls far below the standard I would expect of a premium lounge. It was overcrowded, dark and unwelcoming. On board the aircraft we were offered a hot meal. It was very basic airline fare – chicken and rice, a very hard bread role and some sort of sweet offering (which to be honest I have forgotten about). The seats were old and in disrepair. The fabric looked tired and scruffy. Toilets became more and more filthy during this short flight – I did not see the flight attendants check them once (I was in the back row). I am sorry to say that once again, I was not impressed. Landed at NBO and immigration was via the new makeshift terminal. NBO airport is streets ahead of Addis and will only get better as the new terminals are opened. ET gets you from A to B, but with little comfort or customer service.

### "arrogant and insensitive"
Mumbai to Khartoum via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. It took me 1 hour 40 minutes to get a boarding pass from the Check-in counter and there were people jumping the queues as the staff was least bothered to organise the long queues. There was a delay of 3 hours in departure which resulted in missing the connecting flights for onward journey. The local Ethiopian Airline staff at Addis Ababa had no clue of the late arriving transfer passengers (inspite of boarding passes issued at Mumbai). They were so arrogant and insensitive that after a 1.40 hour check in + 3 hour delay + 5 hour flying time, we were all made to stand at the transfer desk without water or seating. There was only 1 staff who was cancelling and re-issuing new boarding passes for next available flight which took 2 hours. When the passengers got angry, they offered food coupons which can be redeemed only for Chicken gravy, Dry vegetables and rice along with bread and a bottle of water. The vegetarians had to eat plain Rice with Dry vegetables (no curry). No Tea or Coffee was available. The connecting flights were from 5 to 7 hours later. This happened with me on 12th May 2016 - Flight ET 641. Again while returning by ET 345 from Khartoum to Addis Ababa on 16th May, there was no vegetarian meal on board.

### "need to up their game"
First time flying Ethiopian and was excited to fly them as I had heard they were good, one of the best in Africa. Boarded at around 11.30pm in LAX, didn't take off until nearly 2am (I had heard they were often late, which seems to be true on so many occasions - looked at a popular flight tracking website and most if not all their past flights were 1-2 hours or more late). When we finally left LAX, the cabin crew started at the back of economy delivering meals. They reached my seat (front of last economy section) at around 3am. I was handed the tray with "here's chicken", the crew couldn't have been less bothered, no smiles (except from purser when we stepped aboard) and a general look of being completely fed up. The "meal" (using that term very loosely) was absolutely the worst I have eaten on board an aircraft. The tray, food containers and servings were tiny. Rock hard bread bun and a slimy square of something resembling a muffin/desert bread. Measly pieces of chicken in a runny gravy with two tiny boiled potatoes and a piece of broccoli. The crew took so long to collect trays that people started to leave them on the floor by the bulk-head / door. At around 4.30am they were picked up and lights were left on full brightness in the cabin until maybe 5am. My armrest TV was broken as were maybe half of the TV screens in the cabin (this was a relatively new B787-8 aircraft). Toilets were in poor shape for most of the flight. When we arrived in Dublin, we waited at the carousel for bags to be delivered for close to an hour and a half. Tweeted Dublin Airport Authority to ask what was going on and they replied that it was the airline's fault. Reading another review on here, I feel lucky that we got our bags at all. Return flight to LAX two weeks later was better because the flight was maybe a third full and entertainment system was working. However, Food was still pathetic and we left Dublin an hour late. First and last trip ever with Ethiopian. They need to up their game. What a waste to have a fleet of new B787-8 aircraft only to provide such terrible service.

### "used my Voyager miles "
Brussels to Seychelles via Addis Ababa. We used my Voyager miles from SAA to book our holiday in the Seychelles, and only Star Alliance partner that could get us there during the Christmas period was Ethiopian. I booked in March 2015. Ethiopian managed to cancel two of my four flights, resulting in rebooking and losing a day's holiday accommodation (having to return a day earlier) and changed the Boeing 787 to a first generation Boeing 777. I would acknowledge that my family were allowed to go with me (Star Alliance Gold) in the Sheba lounge. Food okay, smiles of staff super, but it was very overcrowded. During all the changes to our flights, I was offered accommodation for my family and tours in Addis (we would have had to spend one unplanned night in Addis). I guess luckily for Ethiopian they cancelled the Seychelles - Addis flight and left us in the Seychelles. The Boeing 777 was old, no entertainment, food was mediocre and none of the attendants actually smiled.

### "luggage still on the plane"
We traveled Los Angeles to Dublin with Ethiopian Airlines. We arrived in Dublin and our luggage was not in the airport. The luggage was still on the plane. They would not retrieve it saying that it was too late and they were taking off, wouldn't even look. We did not get our things until April 11th - 5 days from when we flew. We had no shoes, accessories, tuxedo, gown, make up, hair care, etc. We called and called. Never did anyone respond. We purchased our tickets in advance, paying over $1100 each. I should be reimbursed for all of the items we had to purchase. We attended 6 events while on the trip, had to miss the first one as we didn't have the items we needed to look presentable. We saved for a long time to go on the trip. I shouldn't have had to spend additional money on things I already own - flat iron, clothing, shoes, make up, etc. Not once had Ethiopian Airlines returned a call or email. The Swissport Office said that it happens on every one of their flights. That is unacceptable.

### "quality is not up there"
I flew with the carrier for the first time in March 2016, from Dublin to Los Angeles. I am a frequent flyer, and have at some stage used most of the main international carriers, and this is the first time I have ever felt the need to go to the trouble of writing a poor review for an airline. The outbound flight was rescheduled at the last minute, meaning I arrived just over an hour late to LAX. Subsequently I missed the connecting flight which was Alaska Airlines. They told us to contact Ethiopian, who should have checked us in all the way to our final destination at Dublin airport but had refused to do so. We spent an our on the phone to Ethiopian customer services, as they had no representation at all at LAX. The person dealing with us on the phone was incredibly rude. Eventually he agreed that Ethiopian would pay for and book us on another flight, we were instructed to go back to Alaska Airlines. When we discussed what we were told with them, they said the method suggested was impossible. Luckily Alaska airline were extremely helpful and gave us change of seat fare instead of full fare, on the next flight available, which was actually from Orange County airport the next day, which cost us shuttle bus and hotel. As for the flights themselves, our screens did not work in either outbound or return flight and the crew seemed to think this was normal on a 10 hour flight. I had to clean the toilet on my flight home to use it, as every toilet on the aircraft after 4 hours into the flight was dirty. I am the least fussy eater but I can say the food was not even recognisable for some meals, I suggest bringing your own snacks. Finally the most concerning point, when waiting to leave LA, there was some kind of technical trouble, so we sat on the aircraft for two hours before leaving, late again of course. The problem was, before leaving we received no safety demo. None of the crew came around to inspect the cabin configuration for take off, my friend was fast asleep with her seat reclined as we started to head down runway. Ethiopian Airlines is the first airline I have ruled out so far. The flights were more expensive than other carriers but the quality is not up there with the big carriers I'm afraid. Shame as its a convenient route for me, but the good new is Aer Lingus are starting an LAX route soon.

### "staff very pleasant and efficient"
Johannesburg to London Heathrow via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. Huge seats with masses of legroom. You can lift up the headrests and fold in side flags to stop your head falling sideways. USB charging points. Loads of audio / video channels. All flights left on time. Cabin service is slow but staff very pleasant and efficient. Online check-in didn't work but helpful staff at every airport were able to choose seats for me and even change them when a better one became available. Would prefer to fly again with them purely because of the amount of space you get.

### "airline decline to communicate"
Oslo to Zanzibar via Stockholm, Rome and Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. A 22 hour delay, okay to understand because of problem with a Boeing 787. Whats not ok is that the airline decline to communicate with us after this event. Have contacted them 10 times and the only answer I'm getting is "We will contact you shortly". Posted the story on their Facebook page and the post was deleted and I was prevented for more post on their pages. We sat 7 hours waiting in the plane without being offered water or any other things to drink. Stay away from this airline. Porblems with the plane is understandable but not being willing to communictate with your customers are totally unaccetable.

### "Boeing 777s are worn"
Dubai to Addis Ababa. In spite of their young age, Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 777s are worn. Touch screens do not work, worn seats despite the legroom available. Food disgusting - whatever route you fly, they serve chicken with tomato and rice. A shame for an airline representing a country with such incredible cuisine. Nice crew but not much they can do to improve the poor service at their level. Addis Ababa airport is to be avoided - pass through as fast as you can. Ethiopian Airlines has experienced phenomenal growth but it's a shame to see it has sacrificed quality of service.

### "at least the flight was cheap"
Cheap flights for a cheap service. My Ethiopian Airlines flight from London to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa was one to remember. Sets are pretty small compared to other airlines I have used, TV screen was not working for the flights from London to Addis Ababa, and the food was absolutely poor. I am gluten intolerant and I booked a special meal when I bought the flight, but they don't know what gluten intolerance means. I found on my tray written GF (gluten free) but they gave me bread and muffins (containing gluten) saying that this was what they had. Luckily I brought with me something to eat in case. At least the flight was cheap.

### "impressed by the improvements"
I recently flew Ethiopian Airlines from Johannesburg to London via Addis Ababa. Both flights were operated with a Boeing 777-300, and the aircraft was a lot more comfortable then Emirates. Ethiopian have a 3x3x3 seat layout whereas Emirates is 3x4x3. The aircraft was spacious, seats were very comfortable and seat pitch great. The food on both flights was above what I expected on  and the crew were fantastic. I found them nicer than European airlines I have flown. I will definitely fly them again, but a word of warning. Addis Ababa Bole airport really needs an overhaul and some of the ground staff could do with going on a customer service course. It was a shame that this is what seems to have let Ethiopian Airlines down in the past and still does. On the whole I am impressed by the improvements, and they are a breath of fresh air in Africa.

### "I will not recommend"
This is my first time with Ethiopian Airlines, when I flew round trip from Los Angeles to Dublin. At LAX check-in the agent was very informative and helpful. I thought may be the crew members on board would be the same, but unfortunately I was wrong. The crew were not friendly at all, and there was no warm and welcoming feel to it. They're just there to do their job and get it out of the way. They bump into my seat while pushing the cart and into my elbow few times, I didn't hear any word from them. Not a sorry, excuse me or pardon me or anything. There is no interaction from staff, not even a smile. The food was terrible. I will not recommend this airline.

### "avoid if you must be there on time"
Ethiopian Airlines flight from Douala to Addis Ababa left 1 hour late, due to a burst tyre, but the flight was very pleasant in the Boeing 787-8. Problems started in Addis. The flight from Addis to Dar was delayed every 30 min due to operational reasons, from 10PM local time until midnight, when they took our boarding passes to issue us hotel vouchers. We were taken to a lounge and given some rice and curry chicken. At 2AM we still had no information, and no boarding passes. After harassing the staff, we were told that "due to the weather", we would have to spend the night in Addis and leave at 10AM. We had to wait for hotel vouchers, which were given to us at 4AM. Total waiting time from the scheduled departure time to getting hotel vouchers was 5 hours! The next day, the 10AM flight was delayed by 1 hour for operational reasons. Good side: we were taken to a nice hotel with clean rooms and bathroom (no hot water in bathrooms with a 12°C temperature outside), and were served breakfast before being taken to the airport at 8AM. Conclusion: we landed at 2PM instead of 2AM. To avoid if you must be there on time.

### "not a bad experience"
Cape Town to Roma via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. Flight was 1 hour late departing from Cape Town. Plane was a Boeing 787, the confort is normal, food is normal, not the best but not the worst. Enetertainment is available and limited, USB charger in the console. Transit in Addis Ababa was the worst part of the trip. Old airport, small scanning machine, overloaded airport due to the number of people in transit. Definitely, Addis Ababa hub is not prepared to grow. Staff were quiet helpful to speed up and optimize security check. Not a bad experience, but not the best.

### "helpfulness of cabin crew"
Ethiopian Airlines from Mumbai to Mombasa via Addis Ababa. Mumbai to Addis sector, where I was in Economy was very good. The vegetarian food served was below par but the attitude and helpfulness of the cabin crew more than made up for this deficiency. I got an upgrade to Business Class in the Addis to Mombasa sector where it was a Boeing 777 which went to MBA. The cabin crew in this sector too was high class as was my experience with ET earlier too.

### "were pleasantly surprised"
London to Zanzibar via Addis Ababa. We flew Ethiopian Airlines and were pleasantly surprised. All flights departed and arrived on time, one even early. The cabin crew were pleasant and attentive. The aircraft were modern (Boeing 787 from ZNZ-ADD) clean and well stocked. Food and drinks were served on all sectors, not inspiring but adequate. In flight entertainment was good - excellent on the 787 - the PA announcements were clear and repeated in 5 languages - and the flight deck kept passengers well informed. Overall we were impressed and would fly that route with Ethiopian again, and recommend it to others, for which it repesented excellent value. Although we had a 7hr lay-over at ADD on the return, the airport unusually has comfortable beds in the transit area to lie on and reasonably priced freshly cooked refreshments (even at 01.00hrs) and drinks in various cafes. It was certainly more comfortable than the lay-over at Dubai airport last year. Warning: - do not buy any form of liquids - water, alcohol, or perfumes at the Addis Ababa duty free. Even when sealed and in an official duty-free bag it will be confiscated at an extra security check just before the departure gate.

### "price fantastic for us"
Ethiopian Airlines price was fantastic for us as pensioners, £320 return from Dublin to Johannesburg, so we were willing to put up with a little discomfort, but were impressed with most things. Addis Ababa is not the world's idea of a great airport and the ground staff there were most unhelpful and far from organised. It was only a 2hr 25m stopover, as we waited for our connecting flight to Dublin. The announcement, over an antiquated address system, was called as a Canadian flight and via Dublin was never mentioned, caught it by the skin of our teeth. Ground staff at Johannesburg were great and could not have been more helpful. We had 3 seats each from Johannesburg to Addis to relax on for the 4.5hr flight, food acceptable and no worse than other airlines. The planes look well used and a lot of the seat screens did not work. Cabin crew vary from inexperienced to most helpful and just the luck of the draw. If you are a reasonably experienced flight passenger and want value for money go for it. Total journey time on this flight is 16hr 25m each way.

### "Food remains poor"
Etiopian Airlines remain the cheapest on this route, service is friendly but anouncement by staff go on for ever. Food remains boring, IFE with poor choice of older movies even if blockbuster section. Games on vod system do not work or do not react to commands givbem by in chair remote. Food remains of poor and quality and serving a warm lunch at 11 am and or 1 am is a strange way of trying to cut expenses, a light breakfast or snack would be far better. Ethiopian has reduced the miles you receive as status miles when flying with them - this of course depends what bookuing class you have reserved your ticket. One more new experience the past few months is when flying in to Addis and getting on to your flight for Tel Aviv security is understandable but new security measures are rude and rediculous. Bole intl airport remains the worse airport i have  visited and airport gold lounge of very poor quality.

### "last time flying them"
I flew for the first time on Ethiopian Airlines from London Heathrow to Addis Ababa to Harare in Feb 2016. Unbelievable screw ups! My luggage didn’t arrive and was held in Addis (despite an 8 hr layover!). It came 2 days later even though there are daily flights to Harare. Worse yet, ET completely cancelled my return sector from Harare to Addis (ET 873) without any notice (my email is in the booking file). I only found out by coincidence on checking my booking online. As it was a Sunday and the main city office was closed, I went to the airport to reinstate this sector. Nothing could be done. Go the city office tomorrow, I was told. So, I did and ET office staff first told me my scheduled flight (ET 873) was cancelled. They asked if I could travel a day earlier (and wait 24 hr in Addis for my connecting flight to London-Heathrow). Then, I was told ET 873 wasn’t cancelled after all, and I was given a print-out confirming my flight and a seat on ET 873. Then, trying to check in online, I read a note on my file that there was still a problem with the Harare-Addis sector and I should see the counter check in agent. At airport check-in, I’m told the ET office printout showed a booking in V class but their computer shows U class. (How is that even possible on a single booking?) Even though my original itinerary showed U class, and U is higher than V class, they would not check me in. I waited 45+ minutes for the office and airport staff to correct their problem before being issued a boarding pass. It doesn’t end there. On arrival in London Heathrow (ET 700), I noticed that my previously confirmed aisle seat is now a window seat on my Air Canada (AC 851) flight to Calgary. How can ET even change a confirmed seat on AC when AC couldn’t assign a seat for me on ET prior to my departure? Ethiopian Airlines don’t belong in the Star Alliance. This is my last time flying them.

### "great improvement is needed"
In comparison to travel time and jet lag, Ethiopian Airlines is one of the best airlines to use. However, great improvement is needed in the food services, we were served the same dish 4 times from Entebbe to Toronto. This is not acceptable by any standard. Secondly the airport connection in Addis is very chaotic without any notification from the airport staff, passengers have to figure their own way out. The seats on the 787 are comfortable enough but if the airline does not take care, in a few months the electronics may fall apart. The management must ensure that they improve the friendliness of stewards towards the passengers and try to get to the standards of the other International airlines in order to make a bigger name in Africa.

### "very disappointing"
My first trip with Ethiopian Airlines from Durban to Jeddah return via Addis Ababa was very disappointing. Air-conditioner was not working properly on flight from Jeddah to Addis Ababa and the cabin was very hot. Requested a bassinet seat and was only given on one of the four flights taken. I pre-ordered vegetarian and fruit platter, and the cabin staff said these meals were not available. Staying hungry on a 9+ hour journey not easy.

### "best choice US to East Africa"
Excellent flight and service from Ethiopian on my flights from Washington Dulles to Entebbe via Addis Ababa. Friendly staff, plenty of food and drink, power points in some seats in Economy to charge laptops. Flight was half empty so I got myself 3-seats together (as did all of the last section of the economy cabin). Flight departed and left around on time. A fair number of unruly and loud children on the flight, but that seems to be a standard on long-haul flights to Africa. Addis to Entebbe was good, including a full meal on a 2 hours flight. Only real downside was that the Ethiopian lounge in Addis is a bit of a dive - awful food, very crowded, no showers and few power points. Nevertheless, highly recommended as the best choice for US to East Africa.

### "old and outdated planes"
Addis Ababa to Manila via Bangkok, and Ethiopian Airlines are still operating old and outdated planes. To give you an idea of how old this plane was the safety video showed a Walkman (yes portable cassette player) as an example of electronic devices. Seat leg room is shorter than normal, I'd say 30-31 inches at best. Seats are uncomfortable, the cushions are not well attached and will slide around so you are almost sitting on the seat frame. In flight entertainment consisted of 5 or 6 movies playing on a loop, the screens are very small and picture quality is not good, sound is distorted. Food was poor. Flight attendants spent most of the time in the back and did not walk through with beverages after the normal meal service and did not respond to call button. On all landings (4 on this trip) people started getting up as soon as the wheels touched the ground and the flight attendants sat and watched without saying a thing. Manila to Bangkok the flight was almost empty, but Bangkok to Addis was very full. This airline owns 5 or 6 Boeing 787s which they use for shorter, lower traffic flights within Africa. They really need to start using the better planes for the longer, more crowded flights and start updating their fleet.

### "standard economy class"
Mumbai to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa, and was pleasantly surprised by how well organized Ethiopian Airlines was. A standard economy class cabin, the staff service was excellent. Meals were hot, drinks cold, with alcoholic and non-alcoholic options. The food was on par with any other airline I've flown, and entertainment options were varied, great selection of audio, movie and tv options were current and classic.

### "helpful and friendly"
On my Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur flight it was an old plane. The cabin looks like the mid 80's - no PTV/AVOD (I don't need it on an 2h flight but remember there were some pax coming from Addis Ababa with this plane), old leather seats and a dirty seatpocket. Even if the plane was so old, the FAs did there best to make this flight comfortable and were helpful and friendly. A good hot meal and two times free drinks were served on this short flight. The meal was tasty. Plane arrived 20 minutes early in KUL. Flight in Economy was very cheap compared to Thai or Malaysia Airlines. Captain gave some flight information, nothing special to remember. All in all Ethiopian Airlines is for an african carrier very good, in their modern aircraft it must be a nice experience. I flew Ethiopian Airlines several times now, and never credited my mileage automatically - for frequent flyers not ideal, and you must credit the miles manually by contacting the costumer service of the airline - Ethiopian Airlines should improve that, it should be possible for a Star Alliance Carrier.

### "experience was good"
Toronto to Lagos via Dublin return with Ethiopian Airlines. Overall the experience was good, food was good and service in flight was great. Pleased with the aircraft, low noise levels and fantastic entertainment on board. I was disappointed with the toilet facility onboard on my last leg back to Toronto via Dublin as it was malfunctioning.

### "service on flight was good"
Los Angeles to Dublin with Ethiopian Airlines. Free alcohol and meals were good, TV / movies were good. The plane was clean, service on flight was good. The dinner service was a bit slow as they waited for head steward to tell them to hand over tray. Also the flight was a bit cold so I used 2 blankets. Getting bags off plane in Dublin was slow but that would be Dublin ground crew. You should get to LAX early, as the TSA there seem to be the slowest of any airport in the US - slower even than Chicago. It took an hour and it was not busy in international terminal.

### "the price was good"
Round trip from Los Angeles to Dublin with Ethiopian Airlines. Check in at Los Angeles was rather chaotic, and the supervisor was not very friendly, she actually told the agent that was checking us in, that she was tired of having to show her and explain her everything. Later on she got on the plane, screaming at people and demanding to see their boarding passes. No mention of Lounge access, even though we are Star Gold. Went to the lounge with no problems. There were never any announcements that boarding had started and the screen just showed departure time, but no "boarding". The lounge agent called the gate and she was informed that they were doing last call. Onboard, the aircraft which is only 2 years old, showed its wear and tear. Ripped seat pockets, broken cup holders. Entertainment screen was not responsive. Service was ok. Flight attendants did their job, but no smiles. 2 hot meals served, but no choices. No snacks provided. Meals tasted ok, but looked more like a TV dinner. Return flight from Dublin a little better. Granted the 6am departure is a killer. Again, no mention of lounge access. When asked, we were informed that it was only for Business Class customers. Only after checking with another agent, we were given lounge invitations. Return leg, friendlier crew. Better meals with an option of chicken or ravioli and a hot breakfast, prior to arrival. This plane was in better shape. Biggest complaint is that both flights were delayed by over an hour, while sitting already on the plane. No specific reason was given. Would fly them again because the price was good.

### "definite no fly option"
Ethiopian Airlines has the worst Business Class experience. Old plane, with no personal TV screens, and of the two very small screens at front the plane, one was constantly flickering and the other was black and white. In addition the outlet for the headphones was not connecting properly so sounds was far from clear. Then the choice to play a subtitled Chinese movie was also an odd choice and hardly a new release, if one was able to see or hear the movie. As I went to charge my iphone was told that the power outlet at the seat was not working, then apparently there was not power at any seat. Food was unappetising. Although the staff were pleasant they were far from concerned about the lack of amenities or service in Business Class, and not able to offer any solutions, apart from more overheated food when the first dish was too terrible to consume. A definite no fly option if you want amenities and service in an airline.

### "friendly, polite and professional"
I had very low expectations given how many negative reviews there are, but these were pleasantly exceeded, and I would happily fly Ethiopian Airlines again. The return trip from BKK-ADD was on an old B767, these were rather tired planes, and the business class seats were the old lounger-style - not particularly comfortable for sleeping, but still spacious. From ADD to ACC, the planes were new B787s, and were very comfortable, clean, and in excellent condition. A pity these were not offered on the longer flights to BKK. Cabin crew on all legs were excellent - very friendly, polite and professional. They all made a real effort, and seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Food was plentiful and good - a reasonable selection of dishes to choose from, as well as cheese and desserts; likewise, a good selection of alcohol was offered. I especially enjoyed the selection of Ethiopian dishes on offer, and the cabin crew were very encouraging in getting us to try them. IFE was virtually non-existent on one of the B767, and poor on the other flights, but this would be my only major complaint. Given the low price, I was very suprised at the good quality of service, food and drink - and indeed comfort on the Dreamliner. All flights were on time.

### "cabin crew were really nice"
Excellent flight with Ethiopian Airlines. It's so nice to have a direct flight from Los Angeles to Dublin. I was so surprised to only see a few Irish people on board making use of this excellent connection. I hope Ireland utilizes this more so they keep the route open. My return ticket was only $750 and it leaves Los Angeles at around midnight and lands around 6pm so it really helps with jet lag so you don't need to wait around all day like a zombie before going to sleep. The cabin crew were really nice, helpful and happy to be there. The airplane is the new boeing dreamliner. It's so quiet, the air is not as dry and the entertainment system was great. Loads of good movies to watch.

### "reasonable comfort"
Ethiopian Airlines from Nairobi to Dublin via Addis Ababa. The price is one of the cheapest, but if you don't expect too much, you will not be disappointed - they get you from A to B on time and in reasonable comfort. The food is basic, no choice - chicken in tomato with pasta, on both legs, plus a continental breakfast. The flights were only half full, which made them much more pleasant. The Boeing 787 was quite new and a lovely aircraft. The landing in Dublin was tricky, with stormy conditions, but we got in safely. Addis Ababa is not a great transit airport; think a rather scruffy provincial bus station with waves of people passing throu gh in the late evening.

### "far from its competitors"
Juba to Rome via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. Check-in is always a chaotic experience. Addis Ababa airport looks nice from outside but is a disaster inside, with outdated lounges, filthy restaurants, old shops and dirty toilets. Boeing 787s already look worn and on most planes, the touch screen IFEs do not work well. During the late evening rush hour, flights get delayed. Ethiopian Airlines does not offer a choice of meal on its Addis-Europe flights, hence you only get a hot snack on the 5.30 hour flight between Addis and Rome. How can one think of this as a medium-haul flight? Ethiopian Airlines is still very far from its competitors in terms of service quality and consistency.

### "is just about average"
Dublin to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa return. Everything about Ethiopian Airlines is just about average. Do not have any high expectations for the in flight service of food and entertainment, seats are uncomfortable, toilets are not cleaned, I noticed this on all my 4 flights throughout my trip. The planes are not clean, although the Boeing 787's are relatively new. My biggest issue was at the airport on my way home transiting through Addis Ababa. The airline would allow me to carry three duty free bottles of alcohol that I had bought onboard the plane, one I had bought in Addis Ababa and the others in Johannesburg, in an airport secure bag used for transit, I was forced to check them on with cargo and all smashed of course when I collected at the other end. The staff were rude and unhelpful and could not give an explanation as to why I could not carry these - I've travelled a lot and never had this issue. I emailed the airline to three different emails and have not received any reply at all. I will not fly with this airline again, alothough a little cheaper than others, I would sacrifice some extra money to fly an alternative route.

### "completely cramped flight"
Return journey with Ethiopian Airlines from Joburg to Mumbai via Addis Ababa on 22nd November. Check in at Joburg was a nightmare, the staff member took more than 45 minutes to check us in. Joburg - Addis Ababa was in Boeing 777-300 ER, almost full flight, good food and IFE and drink options available on board, again we had requested for baby milk and were happy this was provided. However, despite repeated reminders to the attendant at the booking counter, this time however we were not provided with a baby cot / aisle seat. My 10 month old daughter was restless almost the whole flight and at times it became very difficult to attend her. What shocked me was they allot aisle seats to kids who are 4/5 yrs old but not for infants and that as well despite repeated reminders to the booking staff. After a 2 hour halt, had a connecting flight to Mumbai from Addis Ababa at 11 pm local time. Again a nightmare, this time in terms of the flight. How can they think of operating a Boeing 737 to Mumbai for a 5 hour flight? Completely cramped flight, no option to even move your hand, forget reclining the seats. Veg Meal was the worse that I have had with any airline. Only plus sign was again they served drinks as often as we wanted. Veg food was an insult, sweet rice and sweet chick pea curry. Attendants pleasant and helpful. Will surely not recommend Ethiopian for Addis Ababa - Mumbai route if they use the Boeing 737-800.

### "crew cheerful and helpful"
Flew Ethiopian Airlines from Mumbai - Cape Town via Addis Ababa and Gaborone on November 10th 2015. Check in at Mumbai was smooth. Mumbai - Addis Ababa flight was a Dreamliner, average veg food but good IFE options available. Drinks were served as and when it was asked for. We were travelling with our 10 month old daughter and had requested for an aisle seat with a cot and were provided with the same. Our request for baby food and milk was also considered. Crew were cheerful and helpful. Transit in Ethiopia was chaotic, Bole Airport is worse than a local bus terminal, make shift toilets, dirty terminals. After an hour's gap, boarded the flight to Cape Town via Gaborone, Boeing 737 can get bit uncomfortable for a 4 hour journey which included an hour's halt at Gaborone [no change of planes]. No IFE and this time the staff made a mistake with the veg food options on board. They offered the veg meal to other group members who had not booked it and hence many people had to stay hungry. They compensated for the main course (they ran out of veg rice) by offering small portions of rice and boiled veg from exec class menu. This was not liked by many travellers.

### "staff fine, dinner ok"
Ethiopian Airlines, Addis to Bangkok, 22/11/15. Excellent flight even in middle aged 767. Left Addis 25 mins late at 00.45. Landed in Bangkok 5 mins early at 13.10. I hate overnight flights but this was bearable. Staff fine, dinner ok. Got a 2nd dinner at 11.00 BKK time. Hugely diassapointed with SUV airport in Bangkok.

### "was spacious seats"
London to Durban via Addis Ababa and Johannesburg. It was spacious seats with plenty of options on the inflight entertainment. Food was pretty good. Despite delays in London having a knock on effect with all my connecting flights, both myself and my luggage made it to Durban by the correct time. Only downside some of the cabin crew appeared a bit surly. Didn't smile much and appeared bored when handing out drinks and food.

### "medical kit onboard a joke"
This will definitely the first and last time using Ethiopian Airlines. My partner and her son travelled from London Heathrow to Ndola in Zambia via Addis Ababa. The check in at London was excellent and the girl on the check-in could not have been more helpful. Once we boarded the flight, things went downhill fast, the cabin crew were not very helpful at all, meals were more or less thrown at you, not served. The food was terrible, the aircon onboard was very poor. During the flight, a guy collapsed while walking about and if it was not for my partner and 2 medical students tending to him, I dont like to think what the outcome would have been, the cabin crew were more concerned with chatting to each other and the medical kit onboard was a joke. The seats were hard and passenger comforts seem to have been forgotten about. After our connection in Addis Ababa you would think it was a different airline, the crew and comforts were first class and we couldn't understand why there was such a huge difference. Not looking forward to trip home.

### "care for luggage is non existent"
I'm a frequent traveler between Bangkok and Cape Town (at least six times per year) and on my last trip (November 2015) I decided to use Ethiopian Airlines because their price was very competitive and it's an African airline, and I always try to support an African enterprise. This time my journey proved to be a mistake and, proved that you get what you pay for. Firstly, the planes were small and cramped - but I suppose this contributes to the low airfare. The departure lounges at Addis Ababa airport were shocking. Most of the info TVs were not working or showing other things apart from flight and departure info. The toilets were horrendous - wet floors, smelly, locks on doors broken, extremely aggressive staff, etc Thirdly and most importantly, Ethiopian Airlines does not take responsibility for your luggage. I had bought a Panasonic LED TV which I took back to Cape Town. At check in I asked for them to put on a Fragile sticker. I was told to take it to Oversize luggage and that they will put on the sticker. This I did and again I asked to for the sticker to be put on. They said they would. When changing planes at Addis Ababa my new seat was above the cargo hold of the plane and I saw them loading on my TV, without any sticker! I wasn't too concerned, as I thought they could quite easily see that it's a TV and would be careful. when I got home in Cape Town, I unpacked the TV only to find the screen had been cracked. I immediately phoned the Ethiopian Airlines call center and was told that I should send an email to Customer Relations explaining the problem. This I did, and I received an automated reply saying that they would get back to me within 10 working days - what a shocking time standard for an international company. After 12 working days I sent them a follow up email, and got a reply to say that the South African office will get in touch with me. On my return trip to Bangkok, I had still not heard from the South African office, so while I was at Cape Town International airport I tried to follow up on the matter only to be given the email address of the man in charge. Thirteen days later I had still not heard from the South African office, so again I sent an email. This time I got a rather prompt reply saying that they could not consider the claim because Ethiopian Airlines should not have accepted the TV when I checked in at Bangkok Airport, and  I took too long to report the incident - even though all my correspondence (from day one) with them was attached to all emails. I'm sure I don't even need to highlight the stupidity of this kind of reasoning. Their lack of accountability and pathetic customer service leaves me more disappointed than angry. I certainly would not say don't use them. If budget is important then they're the best option, however bear in mind they you'll be dealing with a company where customer service is at an all time low and concern and care for your luggage is non existent.

### "I have mixed feelings"
Paris CDG to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. I have mixed feelings about my flights: on the first trip, Boeing 787 airplane already looked ageing althought it cannot be old, FAs were robotic and didn't smile, food from CDG was bad and the breakfast was almost nothing (two biscuits). Return trip was better, with smiley and nice FAs on both flights, sligthly better food and better looking cabins. On the good side, seats were less cramped that I feared (and I'm tall), travel time CDG-JNB is convenient and of course price is competitive. The IFE is convenient but the choice of films and languages is limited, wine was awful and choice of alcool very limited. The FAs were sometimes rude and/or robotic. Addis Ababa airport is the worst part of the experience: awfully crowded, dirty and rather sad. Ethiopian Airlines has become a huge airline but the airport infrastructures have not followed and the result is clearly very negative.

### "it's not worth it"
I've flown Ethiopian within Africa on routes between several cities in Africa and flights have been pleasant. New fleet, cheerful and helpful flight attendants. This is a complete contrast to their flights into and out of the continent. Planes were very old with no inflight entertainment whatsoever. I could never get over the fact that the flight attendants are rude and unwilling to help. I'm not talking about them not smiling (I understand some cultures don't really smile). When several fellow passengers were asking for water or drinks they were ignored. One passenger was trying to call one of them, and he was ignored. When I asked if the flight was full and if it was possible for me to change seats (I was seated next to a very obnoxious passenger), the flight attendant just said "if you can find an empty seat go ahead. Besides that, it takes them way too long to serve food and get the food trays after eating. Some passengers put their trays on the floor creating a mess and it took them too long to clean it, even though they could clearly see the mess those passengers were making. And there are only three toilets in the economy class for almost 200 people. There was a queue to the lavatories the whole time. I booked my flight because they offered the fastest route to my destinations in Africa, but I've discovered it's not worth it. They're not even that much cheaper compared to other airlines! How this airline became a part of the Star Alliance is one of life's greatest mysteries.

### "let down for Ethiopian hospitality"
Addis Ababa to London with Ethiopian Airlines. The seats were very cramped, the service slow and lazy - I was in a window seat and unable to get out, and when I asked for some water the stewardess almost rolled her eyes and finally very grudgingly filled my water bottle. Why not give everyone a bottle as most airlines do on over night flights? The lights were turned off/on and on/off so many times, and it was hard to get sleep when they're doing this frequently. A let down for Ethiopian hospitality which was otherwise so good. Addis Ababa airport was another lesson in poor customer service - 1.5 hrs to get through the second lot before the boarding gate - bad tempered and unpleasant!

### "not for the faint hearted"
I'm a regular flyer on Ethiopian Airlines (London to Addis Ababa). The positives are few and far between. You are unable to check in online in the UK. The transfer service at Heathrow is terrible where the desk only opens 2 hours before departure. The IT system at Heathrow is almost non existent, and you are unable to upgrade, and bookings, even adding your Star Alliance Gold Card don't work. Boarding the plane is a shambles. Amazingly even the new aircraft look tired and shabby. The onboard toilets are filthy and often there are no hand towels. The staff appear poorly trained. The choice of drinks is limited and poor quality and food is normally poor. My luggage gets lost about 1 in 3 of all flights on Ethiopian. Luggage tracing is non existent. The Bole Airport experience is pretty poor, aggressive customs, shambolic Visa on Arrival, rip off taxi drivers. I used to fly business class but it is simply not worth it. An Ethiopian Airlines flight is not for the faint hearted.

### "use again if prices remain o good"
Business class from Dublin to Addis Ababa and economy onto Cape Town. Excellent help at the check in desk at Dublin and easy boarding despite plane arriving late from Los Angeles. Great welcome on the plane and helpful staff throughout - this was so on the economy flight to Cape Town as well. Very comfortable business class seats - although going full flat to 180 degs would be better. 7Boeing 87 a great plane to fly on - quiet and better cabin conditions. Boeing 737 to Cape Town very full - spacious seating for a small plane. Good service with reasonable food. Toilets kept clean. Realtively easy boarding in Addis Ababa via bus transfer. First time using Ethiopian and likely to use again if prices remain so good. Shame about their hub at Addis Ababa - not the best airport in the world.

### "pay excess baggage for duty free"
I was travelling Ethiopian Airlines to Lagos from London via Addis Ababa. I bought 2 bottles of perfume and 3 books with some chocolates at the duty free shops. When I got to the gate, I was shocked to meet a very hostile Ethiopian Airlines staff there who said I was now over my baggage allowance and I was told that I had to pay for excess luggage or miss my flight. He was very rude when I tried to explain myself to him. I had never experienced anything like that with any other airline before. What you buy at duty free shops airside shouldn't count as excess luggage, especially when it's not excessive. Otherwise why are the shops there? I had the receipts as proof that the items were bought there at the airport but he didn't want to hear anything I had to say. He shouted at me everytime I tried to explain. So I had no choice but to pay. Is this right for airlines to make passengers pay for excess baggage for duty free goods bought at the airport? I have given the ground service rating 1 star because there's nothing lower. They don't actually deserve any star at all. The cabin staff were good.

### "never been treated so badly"
I've just returned from a trip using Ethiopian Airlines. On the outbound journey they bumped us off one flight, bumped us off another then re routed us via Entebbe causing us to miss a whole day of activities whilst on tour in Rwanda. When we arrived it was to major disappointment our luggage didn't. The airline staff had no idea where our bags were and it took 2 days to locate them (one member ensuring us they were in Addis and would be arriving on the next flight, 6 flights arrived and still no luggage and one telling us they got takn off in Entebbe as there was no room on the plane due to other cargo). This ruined the start of our holiday as well as missing out on activities that we had pre paid for! The return leg was nothing more than a farce and absolute disgrace to the aviation industry! We were due to depart Kigali at 3.30 on Sep 29th, they hoarded the passengers to the gate where we were kept for over 4 hours as the screen kept displaying delay messages, no staff were present to request assistance from, nor was there access to any bathroom or water, we were hot and tired along with many other passengers. Eventually, around 6pm, we found out the flight was cancelled due to a cracked windscreen. This is not the ideal information to receive. Instead of handling the situation, their ground staff manager in Kigali airport was a disgrace and had no customer service skills. We were given no information and when asking for information or whether we could be rebooked she continued to shout at all the tired and upset passengers and treat us like dogs. We were herded round the back of the airport to collect our own bags and told to leave if we want - to go where?? Having arrived at the airport at 1.30pm and after a long tiring day we eventually were rebooked by 10.30pm, it took 9 hours and we were offered nothing! Not even a spoken apology came from the ground staff! We were rebooked at 2.30am on September 30th and had nowhere to go. We then had to go via Addis and Dubai and had approx another 24 hours of travelling till we'd reach our final destination. This meant taking extra days of vacation as we arrived back a day late. We were offered nothing by means of an apology, food or water just abuse by the Ethiopian Airlines ground staff. I've never been treated so badly in my life, my holiday was ruined due to their inability to provide the service I paid for and it was apparant they do not care about their passengers just making money by redirecting flights to collect more people (money) and refusing to rebook us with alternate airlines when cancelling our flight. I am appalled a so called customer service orientated company can treat human beings like this, yet alone paying customers! To make matters worse the planes were old, there was no entertainment on board, not even a shared TV screen and the seats were old and uncomfortable.

### "serve other nationals better"
I flew Ethiopian Airlines from Washington to Addis Ababa. From the outset, the flight attendants were not even close to "hospitable". There were times that I needed a glass of water a number of times I was given a completely unwelcoming demeanor from the flight attendant that i talked to. It is a completely unfriendly vibe that you will find. I know about Ethiopian culture as I myself am an Ethiopian. We grew up being told serving others is inferior than being served and we tend to reflect that in all our dealings. What was painful was to see them serve other nationals better, even if we paid the same amount of money for the service. My return trip was better than my trip home. We were served Injera that I didn't find in my first trip and the attendants were also better.

### "this is a flight worth considering"
As a Star alliance partner, Ethiopian Airlines share the domestic route with Air India from Kochi to Mumbai. My flight was from Mumbai to Addis and Addis to Dar es Salaam. Overall, I would say this is a flight worth considering. The quality of the flight is good and the service is also reasonably good. Inflight entertainment needs to be improved. A route from India (or any other country for that matter) should have more choices for the local people who travel that route. Except that it was a comfortable journey. Airport in Addis needs to be improved a lot. Addis to Dar flight was less crowded and food was not so great, but good. Overall a good experience.

### "complete disregard to customers"
After a first (and last) experience with Ethiopian Airlines, I will never recommend it. We booked a round trip to Benin and at destination on Sat Aug 15 in Cotonou, 3 of our bags were missing. We were told we would get them the following Monday. However, we didn't get our bags until Wednesday the 19th. Following this horrible experience, a representative of ET took care of us in Benin and did a great job. Unfortunately, we are back in the US today and none of our bags (4 of them) made it. This is unacceptable and a complete disregard to customers. The representatives at the airport just told us that we would get our luggage without any explanation, many other flyers were in the same situation in both Cotonou and Dulles. The bags had all priority tags on them and were still left behind. On a first flight with Ethiopian Airlines, we are completely discouraged by the service.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I flew ET on 27 Aug 2015 from BKK to ADD in Business Class. Knowing the massive investment of Ethiopian in brand new B787 planes I expected also a good quality in the rest of the ET's fleet - I was completely wrong. The Business Class on B767-300 is at least 20 years old. Seats are with old mechanical controls and not working properly. In-flight entertainment is very poor and the screen's quality is very bad. The two hostesses tried to do their best but the state of the cabin was so poor that it was impossible to enjoy this 8 hrs flight. First and last time I fly Ethiopian.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
My family were traveling on Ethiopian Airlines for the first time. Unfortunately our experience was not very pleasant. We were traveling on July 27th 2015 from DUB-LAX. We arrived to find that our flight had been delayed, we had not been notified neither text, or email (which is standard by most airlines) nor did the ground staff have any idea of the length of delay. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 7.15am. Our flight crew showed up after 8.00am. Still my two excited children were excited about the trip ahead of them. We boarded the plane and found our seats. Then we waited and waited. We waited 30 minutes for the missing passengers to board. Unfortunately for 8 hours out of the 11 hour flight we had two children screaming and fighting with each other and kicking seats of other passengers. (Its not the airlines fault). We had one receptive flight attendant the whole time. She was delightful and did her best at trying to locate our pre-ordered meals. The other flight attendants seemed exhausted, by the end of the trip they just hit the back of a passengers chair if it was in full recline and would say "move it up" it just became comical. The inflight entertainment was scarce, the flight tracker was never reset as it stated we were departing from Addis Ababa not Dublin. By the time we landed in LAX there was no "thank you for flying with us" just "bye" as all the passengerd exited. One of my children had left a bag with toys under the seat in front of her. We did not discover this until we haf arrived at our accomdation. Simple fix right? Call the airline and airport. Wrong, 3 days of being put on hold, being transfered then being hung up on time after time. We finally got a number of a gate agent who said they would call us back (they never did) again we tried and someone told us to come to "CBS" one 1.5 hours later we got the bag back. Then only then someone asked us to fill out a missing bag report after we had tge bag in hand. Horrible experience.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Ethiopian boasts about having the youngest fleet in Africa, this may be the true, but they use their very old planes to fly to Thailand. I have flown for the second time in one in business class, Bangkok-Addis Ababa return, and am totally disgusted. The plane is not only old (ashtray in lavatory ! ), but the seating is bad, narrow and not always working. There is no VOD. Overhead compartments are small. Food average, nothing to be proud of, with one of the dishes on the menu almost always missing. In contrast, the flight on a Boeing 777-300 from Addis Ababa was nice (good seat, good entertainment, same so-so food), but crew was nice in all cases.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
This is my first time on Ethiopian airlines and was impressed. The Route from LAX to Dublin is new and just started in June 2015. I was hesitant when booking but the fares were extremely good. The flight attendants were wonderful and I was impressed by their professionalism and concern for the passengers needs and comfort. The food and drink was very good. The plane being a new 787 Dreamliner was immaculate and this is the fastest flight I have had to Dublin. The direct route from LAX to DUB definitely filled a void since Aer Lingus pulled out several years ago. I would recommend this airline. The prices are reasonable and the service is fantastic. The hours of this flight are a little odd leaving LAX around midnight. The Dublin flight leaves for LAX at 6.15 am. If you can deal with those hours then this airline is the way to travel. No more flying 5 plus hours to the east coast laying over for hours and then having another 7 hour journey ahead. Our flight time was a little over 9 hours to Ireland.

I boarded a flight from Jeddah to Addis Ababa connecting to Johannesburg. Due to the late arrival of the flight from Jeddah passengers connecting to Johannesburg where treated like cattle and rushed onto the connecting flight. My issued boarding pass with my pre-booked seats was changed. Our special meals was not provided or loaded on the craft. I am told that its a normal thing on Ethiopian airlines for luggage not to arrive. On arrival no luggage arrived in Johannesburg. I don't recommend this airline.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I flew my family of 8 in economy on Ethiopian Air July 2 2015, IAD-ADD-JRO and back on July 12th. 777-300 on the ADD legs and 787's on the JRO legs. I have nothing but compliments on the aircraft, cabin staff and the overall experience! Much better service on all four flights than on most domestic carriers and they were pleasant. The cabin did get a little messy on the way back but what do you expect on a 17 hour flight? I would have no hesitation taking EA again or recommending to someone.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
LHR to ADD, June 8, return 30th. Excellent flight both ways. Superb planes. Helpful cabin staff. Smooth boarding at new LHR Term 2 compared to old T3. Flight time now only 7 hours. By far the best way to get to Addis. Addis airport efficient both ways. Do not like arriving at new LHR T2, massive long walks, baggage slow, not enough lifts from arrivals to public transportation. Aspects of the design of this new terminal at Heathrow are very poor.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
At Nairobi airport, I was offered use of a small Kenya Airways lounge. Quite pleasant and adequate for a short wait. Boarding on time. Seats in the 737 were spacious and fairly comfortable. As there were only 5 business class passengers, I had an empty seat beside me. Food and service were good. Overall a pleasant flight. Addis Ababa airport was chaotic. A lot of people sitting around in corridors with mountains of hand luggage. The Ethiopian lounge was busy but I was able to get a seat. The seats looked good but were distinctly uncomfortable. No facilities for lying down or sleeping. Food and beverages were OK but not great. No showers and toilets not great. Wifi was available but very patchy in coverage and speed - staff were obviously aware of this as they warned me when I asked for the password. I was looking forward to the flight ADD-LHR as it was on one of Ethiopian's fairly new 787s. Boarding was fine. Business class layout was 2-2-2 but as there were few passengers, I could have an empty seats beside me. The seats were very disappointing and appeared to be an old design. They reclined to a relatively flat bed but it was angled and lumpy - not good for sleeping. Why Ethiopian would buy modern aircraft and fit them with inferior seats in their most profitable cabin is impossible to understand. Food was not good. I had beef which was tough and poorly seasoned. Other parts of the meal were similarly disappointing. In the business class cabin, there were 3 crew. One was dressed in a colourful uniform and was both pleasant and efficient. The other two were in drab outfits and had personalities to match. IFE worked OK but had a limited selection. The flight arrived on time. On arrival at LHR, my checked bag was not there. When I had checked it in at NBO, a large green tag reading "transfer at ADD" had been attached to it but, as I later found out, it had been left at Addis Ababa. Staff at the missing luggage counter at LHR were helpful and efficient but Ethiopian clearly were not. I arrived at LHR early on a Friday morning. It was not until nearly midnight on Saturday (and after numerous enquiries) that my bag was finally delivered to me in central London.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Flew to Bangkok from Nairobi and return and I certainly did not enjoy the flight back. The Boeing 767's used from Bole International to Suvarnabhumi Airport and back are very old, felt like I was on a bus. The inflight entertainment is awful, variety of shows is poor, TV screen is unclear and the seats have signs of wear and tear. My flight from BKK to Bole was delayed by 3 hours which meant I missed my connecting flight, but that was sorted out once we landed in Addis. All in all, I would not recommend for long haul flights, however short haul flights are bearable.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I flew Ethiopian Airlines as they are a part of Star Alliance. Flight from Mumbai which was scheduled at 5.30 AM took off near 7 AM. Missed my connecting flight to Accra. Was put up in Addis Ababa at a hotel with very limited menu for people who had missed connecting flights. Seems both the airline and the hotel were used to this problem, as my flight ticket for next day and hotel were already printed when I arrived at Addis Ababa. Food was just ok. Entertainment was good.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Pretty horrible flight, with plane crowded and dirty. There were already transit passengers on board (from Burundi) when we boarded and the aircraft did not appear to have been cleaned. Took off around 30 minutes late with no explanation. Crew seemed disinterested and there was no inflight entertainment. The only positive point was that the meal was reasonably tasty and there was beer and wine on offer. The condition of the toilets was disgusting even at the start of the flight. Despite having a relatively good reputation, I will try my best to avoid using this airline again.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I know many people seem to recoil when I tell them I am flying on an African airline but I would fly Ethiopian Airlines anytime over any US airline. The service is top notch, the flight attendants, professional and attentive, and very patient with some very rude passengers. I have flown Ethiopian a number of times now and have seen a progressively improving level of service. Addis airport is a very efficient HUB through Africa. The flights within Africa are not as good (still better than most) than the flights to North America. Also, the fares are very reasonable and passengers aren't nickel-and-dimed to death which is now the norm in the US flights.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
ADD to Heathrow March 16th in daylight. Check in Addis excellent and quick. Breakfast at the cheapest cafe in Terminal 2 OK but service a bit half hearted. Price up to $6 plus 25%. Boarding very quick. Flight superb except that as others note the standard of food on Ethiopian is slipping downwards no choice for lunch. Arrived spot on time and getting through new Terminal 2 at LHR better than my first time in October!

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I had the most uncomfortable experience flying between Accra-Luanda and returning the same route. The flight was delayed and without any explanation or updates from the carrier. The cabin was very dirty and poorly maintained. The facilities were pathetic and not well serviced during the flight. Cabin crew were poorly trained or lacked customer friendliness and seemed very aloof without much concern. The overnight hotel accommodation was pathetic. Boarding procedures were woefully managed. No recognition was provided to the star tier members when checking in at the counter or when boarding. People simply pushed their way through. Given the type of client and nationalities that use this route the cabin attendants had no control over the passengers and during landing and take off there was much confusion with passengers standing up and opening the over head compartments long before the aircraft had reached the docking bay. Passengers were randomly spitting on the floor without any care for other passengers or having been informed by the incompetent cabin crew about the use of the facilities provided. The ground staff were equally unhelpful.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I have flown Ethiopian Airlines 3 times. None of my trip was smooth. I reserved my seat during booking. Somebody was in my seat and I was told its a free seating flight. I requested a Gluten Free Meal my meal was given to somebody else instead I was served different kinds of cheese with bread containing gluten. I have always been served chicken with rice and normal bread (Gluten) the same type of meal was served for breakfast. Delays are never announced. Flight was rescheduled without advance warning. Getting a wheelchair takes forever and not guaranteed this led us to miss our flight.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I have flown Ethiopian Airlines 3 times in the last 4 months (DC to various countries in East Africa via Addis). I love that the airline has a direct flight to East Africa but I am getting tired of a few things that will likely make me use other airlines that pass through Europe. The tickets are good value for money but the more you fly it the things it doesn't do well start to grate on you. The food! Like someone else said it's bad. They have maybe 3 entrees on rotation (a curry chicken seems to be the most common) and it gets old fast especially if you connect on another flight and are served the same entree you ate a few hours ago. The desserts are often a soapy flavored mousse. The middle of the night snack is the worst- it is all carbs and bad! A muffin or croissant a white bread roll and a fruit cup. Essentially it's cheap and not good quality (in terms of airline food quality). Also they don't serve enough water throughout the 12-16 hour flight especially because you can't bring on your own water at the Addis airport unlike you can in the US. That makes for a long thirsty flight. I just got off a flight today where one of the bathrooms was completely out of commission and another had a sink that didn't drain. That's bad and I am not convince that these things get fixed between flights. If you need a cheap flight to Africa go for it but if you are like me and traveling for work it gets old very quickly. I want to save my NGO money and so Ethiopian Airlines is an economical option but honesty not sure that I can tolerate it much more. Also between November an February they did not change the films which meant that my 2nd round trip was a long flight without entertainment. That being said the system is good when there are programs and films you want to watch.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Ethiopian is a good airline all things considered including the pricing which is reasonable. I only have 2 complaints. One is the food. On my recent flight from Kilimanjaro Tanzania to Addis and then to Toronto I was served curried chicken and rice 3 times and this included the breakfast arrival meal in Toronto! The bread is stale also. The menu needs to be reviewed for travellers who do not eat chicken at rice every day as I know many Tanzanian and Ethiopians do. There are other nationalities flying on this airline and variety would be greatly appreciated. It is a 15 hour flight from Addis to Toronto and to have terrible food for such a long way is very unacceptable. Also the toilets are not kept clean during such a long flight and supplies are not renewed. however the staff are friendly and helpful and the coffee at least is good!

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
We flew to Johannesburg South Africa (connecting via Adis Ababa). We had a fantastic experience. Brand new plane excellent service the in-flight entertainment works from the moment you board. Food was excellent and generous with the beverages (unlike other airlines). I recommend using this airline with full confidence. If you can fly in the day so you can see the beautiful landscapes of Ethiopia the Sahara the Mediterranean and so on.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I have been flying with this airline for twenty years. At first it offered good service but since it has set off on the path of expansion it standards have been rapidly deteriorating. Flight staff are poorly trained and only seem interested in looking nice (important but not enough). Its planes on the Rome - Addis route are old filthy and uncomfortable. More often than not toilets don't work! I complained to their customer service and did not even get a reply now I am booking a a much more expensive airline.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
It's a Dreamliner on this Addis Abeba to Shanghai route. Feeling happy for I love flying on the 787! This 10 hour flight has a roomy 2-2-2 configuration in business class. Although the flat beds are angled I was so exhausted that I slept well. The ground operations at the airport were completely disorganized so was happy to see that the staff onboard were much more collected. Had a great meal. Actually interesting choice of meals on this flight. While other airlines would have served a dinner and breakfast on a 10-hour overnight flight Ethiopian Airlines chose dinner and lunch combo. Two hearty meals. I like it for I was very hungry. Especially when they rolled out a tray of assorted Ethiopian specialities. Yummy! The IFE seemed to work well although with a very limited selection of movies. I also love the uniforms and branding of Ethiopian Airlines. The female uniforms are traditional - and the corporate colours very bright. Nearly fluorescent pink yellow and green. After a few flights with them I have to say they are excellent in the air but a total mess on the ground! Shame for they have a lot of potential.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
IAD-ADD-ZNZ-ADD-EBB-ADD-IAD 12/24/14 - 1/9/15. Comfortable flights (777-200 LR 777-300ER 767-300ER). Service onboard is good. Crew is very helpful. Cabins were clean but on the long range flights the toilets ran out of paper (both toilet tissue and paper towels). Many reviewers have commented about cleanliness of aircraft. I would fault the clientele and not the airline. Each time I boarded the planes were clean. Boarding process in IAD EBB went smoothly as did transiting ADD for IAD and ZNZ. The boarding process in ZNZ and ADD for flight to EBB was chaotic. No announcement made as to cancellation of our original flight. We ended up on a entirely different aircraft 757-200 with a new flight number. Flight segments from ZNZ-ADD-EBB were open seating. This was my first experience with Ethiopian Airlines. I would not choose this airline again because one has to transit through ADD. Transiting through ADD can be chaotic or smooth depending on where your flight is headed. Kudos to Ethiopian for screening for Ebola on arrival. On all planes 757 767 and 777 there was plenty of legroom. Inflight entertainment was unavailable on 767.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Ethiopian airlines is terrible with consistent delays never making any announcements. After more than two hours of waiting for our flight it was a pleasant surprise that we got their new long-haul 787 Dreamliner on this relatively short 120 min flight from Arusha to Addis Ababa. Didn't have time to test out everything but I love the Dreamliner and its spacious 2-2-2 interior. Was great to get full-service on this short flight.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
The cabin was hot my TV did not work some toilets not functioning the flight attendants were rude. But those are all small quibbles compared to the 12-hour delay we experienced and the airline's refusal to take any responsibility for it. I was coming back to Pittsburgh from Kilimanjaro via Addis Ababa Rome and Washington. At Rome the plane had a mechanical error and Ethiopian sent us into the terminal. There was no gate agent to tell us what was happening or even where in the terminal to go. Instead of telling us that the problem would take 12 hours to fix which would have allowed us to see Rome a bit the airline kept telling us that boarding was imminent so we sat in the airport for around 12 hours. The airline bought each of us a croissant and a bottled water while the mechanics tried to fix the problem. Although there were other flights to the US leaving that morning the airline did not rebook us to those flights. Finally when we arrived in Washington twelve hours late the airline did not tell us about connecting flights or compensation and did not even provide a gate agent to talk to. Instead we were directed to email customer service. Although I was luckily able to get back to Pittsburgh the same night many others on the flight with longer connections had to spend an involuntary night in Washington. The flight from Washington to Addis Ababa was late too by about two hours. I deeply regret flying with Ethiopian and will never choose them again.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I flew 5 months ago from Paris to Libreville and Back with a transit in Addis Ababa. It was the worst flight experience I have encountered. The seats were filthy and old. I missed my flight from Addis to Libreville which left earlier than expected I presume. When I purchased the ticket they told me I had 2 hours for connection and I thought it was enough. I had to spend a night in Addis. Next morning we were taken to airport and flew to Libreville and found out that my luggage is still in Addis and was told to wait for the next flight. Finally they did manage to reclaim my luggage after 5 days in Gabon. The return flight was no different. Same old aircraft unprofessional staff. Everything was a disaster and I will recommend this airline to no one.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
We travelled with a group of 12 from Kinshasa to Mumbai (including 4 kids). We had booked our tickets almost 2 months in advance and received our boarding passes for our connecting flight to Mumbai in Addis Ababa. First of all when we got on the plane in Kinshasa the aircraft was not clean. There was garbage on the floor and in the seat pockets. The washrooms were not cleaned there was no toilet paper in some of them and some were even flooded. After taking off in from Kinshasa we landed in Brazzaville and spent another hour there for passengers to get off and on. It wasn’t until 3 hours after getting on board did we receive something to eat. This was an afternoon flight going right through lunch time. We had ordered special meals which were not honored. We were not given kids meals which were also ordered. There was no choice of food we were only given beef and informed they did not have any chicken left. This was quite surprising as we were sitting near the front. In Addis Ababa we were surprised to find that the gate for our connecting flight had been closed and the flight was leaving. The excuse we received was that the flight was full. After realizing that there were approximately 50 passengers left stranded they told us that they downgraded the aircraft and there was no more seats left. After hours of negotiating we were finally given a hotel and a boarding pass for the next day’s flight. At 1am (4hrs after landing) we finally had the information to go to our hotel. I’m a Silver Star Alliance member and my Frequent Flyer number was not added to my ticket. This is my second experience on Ethiopian. The first was equally bad however I thought I would give it a second chance. This has been the worst experience I have had on any airline.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Have recently flown Addis Ababa - Gondor - Lalibella - Addis Ababa over a period of two weeks. I was very impressed with their aircraft cabin crew and punctuality. In fact flights are inclined to leave early so make sure you're at the airport with plenty of time to spare. This is also necessary as security is tight and takes a little while to get through if there is a crowd. All flights were full so booking in advance definitely recommended. Only the Addis - Gondar outbound flight had a meal service (quite good roll but very rushed. I was in the back row and was delivered my meal as the cabin crew were asked to prepare for landing) - which surprised me as it's only a one hour flight. All other flights had a drink service. I paid a high premium for my these flights as I had arrived into Ethiopia on Emirates rather than Ethiopian Airlines. Anyone arriving on their own airline gets a big discount. Still I recommend them highly. Very efficient.

Eighth round trip with Ethiopian (EAL). The good - the B787 service from IAD-ADD-JUB in a mere 19 hours which is blazing fast. The con's - one flight cancelled outright without notice which added 6 hours to my trip. Another flight on the 13NOV14 trip suffered a weather delay of 90 minutes at IAD due to fog in the morning. The result was a 09:04 arrival in Addis for a 09.50 flight to Juba which was still on the ground. Five of us needed to make that connection and expressed this to the staff but the did not prioritize our exit from the aircraft. We approached four different airport employees and were met with varying degrees of indifference and inaction. Finally arriving at Terminal 1 (for regional flights) the aircraft that had been there had left. No flights for Juba were listed either as boarding or for the rest of the day. No gate agent here and security agents and lounge staff directed us to Immigration to locate one. Got back to Terminal 2 and onto a flight to Entebbe and a connection there to Juba. In the end not only I but my checked bag made it to Juba - granted five (5) hours late.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Flew YYZ-ADD (Toronto to Addis) on November 8 2014 to begin my east African honeymoon. I was excited to fly on Ethiopian's Dreamliner for almost 13 hours. The trip was pretty good though not as good as I had hoped. I previously flew on Air Canada's Dreamliner and the difference was like night and day. Ethiopian's seats were already weathered - which is stunning considering the aircraft is brand new. The washrooms were absolutely atrocious. What was comforting to me was that I witnessed one of the flight attendants going into the washrooms with blue rubber gloves to clean it. I was appalled to see her cleaning the galley and serving a drink with the same gloves to a passenger who came to the back. Then flew the airline from ADD to DAR (Dar Es Salaam) a few days later and had the worst airline experience: Our travel documents indicated the plane was a Boeing 737-700. Great planes for short to mid-haul flights. We boarded a very old and decrepit Boeing 757. Mechanics were fixing it as we boarded. Not a comforting sight. I asked to sit beside my wife (we're on our honeymoon) and we were told we were seated together. We weren't. The guy in between us was the largest man on the flight. He was so large any other airline would have asked him to purchase a 2nd seat. He didn't even wear his seatbelt but covered it up with pillows. The flight attendants didn't want to ask him to fasten his seat belt until I made a fuss about it telling them that he is endangering other passenger. Finally they got a seat belt extension for him. We found other seats bulkhead towards the back of the plane. It smelled so bad from the washrooms we were barely able to eat. My table tray was broken. I mentioned it to the flight attendant and she said "it's fine". The food ended up place on my lap instead. As mentioned I barely ate it anyway. No in-flight entertainment. I have one more flight on this journey with Ethiopian. I pray it will be better. The airline will receive a letter from me regarding service but most importantly safety.

While we did get to and from our destinations mostly on time it is difficult to understand how Ethiopian Airlines is a member of Star Alliance. Both on the ground and in the air this airline needs significant improvement. Our trip began with a chaotic boarding process that lacked any organization. Multiple lines and pushing your way onboard seemed to be standard procedure. Once onboard the flight attendants did the absolute minimum required of them performing meal and drink services and then disappearing. While they did their job it was done without any warmth or hospitality. On the ground in Addis Ababa you are met with more chaos and disorganization. Flights are cancelled or changed without any notice (the flight is simply removed from the display in the terminal as if it did not exist) security lines extend the entire length of the terminal and there is one representative at an information desk to provide assistance for all passengers in the terminal. This was our overall experience on all the Ethiopian Airlines flights we took. While they may fly new equipment such as the 787 that cannot hide their failures in service and organization. Even for a little extra money choosing an alternate carrier would be well worth your consideration.

4 flights on Ethiopian Airlines. My flights were Washington to Nairobi thru Addis Ababa and returned the same way. The flight over appeared to be a fairly new plane and quite comfortable. I am 6' 4" and found the legroom adequate. It helped that the seat next to me was empty. The food was typical airline food (rather nondescript). I found the cabin staff fairly attentive. The plane to Nairobi and was much older and the consensus among my travelling companions that had the flight been longer than the two hours it would have been unbearable as the seats were old and uncomfortable. The return flight was comparable to trip going over. Once again the seat next to me was empty for the 15 or 16 hr flight. I agree with other reviewers about the lack of cleanliness in the bathrooms. This appears to be a shortcoming of the staff. I was underwhelmed by the counter staff both going and coming - it was apparent that they could care less about customer service. Overall my experience with the airline was good and I would fly them again. I did not find the airport in Addis Ababa to be a problem as other reviewers have.

On October 28 2014 I flew from Bole Airport to Frankfurt Germany via flight 706 enroute to Geneva Switzerland. This was the worst experience in my 26 years of flying overseas. Incredibly rude and unfriendly service. During breakfast wake-up right before landing in Frankfurt one side received breakfast and the other side didn't! No professional skills non-whatsoever.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I have been extremely disappointed with the last 4 flights that I have taken with Ethiopian Airlines. On Sept 11 I flew ADD - MOI via Kilimanjaro. There was no soap in either bathrooms in economy class. The bathrooms were also generally dirty and not cleaned well. When I alerted the flight attendant she nonchalantly told me to use the other bathroom. I was shocked then to find the same problem when I returned to ADD from MOI on September 14. This time I asked 2 flight attendants for soap and they poured a bit into my hand from a small bottle that they had in the galley. The bathroom was again generally dirty and unpleasant smelling. On September 25 I flew from ADD to BKK. Again no soap in the bathroom. I now feel that planes that are serviced in Addis Ababa are done so to a very low standard. The plane itself a 767-300 was in generally poor condition with loose armrest covers worn fabric and trash in seat pockets. The temperature in the plane was also uncomfortable warm for the entire flight and only one movie was shown during an 8.5 hour flight. Check-in for the return flight from BKK to ADD was the most disorganized debacle I have seen in 20 years of flying. The manager was ineffective lines were disorderly and the process took far too long. No one seemed to care about the dirtiness of the bathrooms which was particularly troubling. Overall I have been disappointed by the overall poor organization and quality of Ethiopian Airline flights and wonder how the airline maintains its status as a Star Alliance member. Perhaps if I were a gold member I would have had better experiences for I have enjoyed 1 or 2 business class trips on Ethiopian. Although I lack Gold status I am nonetheless a paying customer who travels frequently and believe that I deserve to have a clean comfortable flight no matter which cabin I choose for a particular flight. I have not found that to be on Ethiopian Airlines. I live in Addis Ababa so often Ethiopian Airlines is the only option that I have for certain routes. I can't and won't pretend that I'll never fly Ethiopian again. But given a choice on a particular route I will choose to fly other airlines from here on out. For friends visiting Ethiopia from the US and other places I will also recommend that they choose Turkish Airlines or Emirates for a better quality experience.

Heathrow - Lusaka Via Addis Ababa Economy. It was the only flight I could get to and from Lusaka. I wasn't expecting much but they're not as bad as they seem not bad but not great. Flight from Heathrow boarded on time I struggled to find my seat as the seat numbers on the luggage compartments were unreadable as they were so worn down. Upon finding my seat there was somebody sat there kindly asked them to move which they did. Left 10 mins late but arrived at Addis early. The cabin crew on our flight to Addis were very ignorant all the flight attendant calls were ignored however they did leave drinks out in the galley and I was told to 'serve myself whatever I wanted'. The Toilet was filthy wet and covered in tissue same went for the other toilets windows very dirty and greasy. Addis airport is terrible no signs or information except 3 flight information screens. Three toilets for the whole terminal long queues. The queue for security before boarding your flight was long and unbelievably slow. Shops are ridiculously expensive as normal. The flight to Lusaka was brilliant the crew were much more attentive food on both flights was very tasty (beef curry with rice). Both flights were on the new 787's. Both seats on both flights were hard and uncomfortable quite narrow. Inflight entertainment on both flights was somewhat acceptable. Aircraft was very clean. Lusaka to Addis was on an old 767 which on the exterior showed its age. The interior was clean and tidy however lacked inflight entertainment. Service was good as was the food fish curry and rice. Addis to Heathrow on the new 777 flight left at 1am boarding was chaos annoyingly we were served a meal at 2am chicken curry and rice which was tasty but didn't go down well. Flight arrived in London on time all flights were smooth. The 777 and 767 was a lot more comfortable than the 787 we found the seats on the Dreamliner too narrow.

I was on flight ET 701 scheduled to depart Heathrow for Addis on Oct 6 with immediate connection to Entebbe. In the boarding lounge before 8pm. We remained there for 6 hours until the flight was finally cancelled long after the airport had effectively closed for the night and all other flights had long since departed. Initially we received the 30-minute updates that ET promises. The almost-new Boeing 787 Dreamliner needed a spare computer part which arrived after 4 hours and then apparently it needed another part. I can accept that this was not the fault of ET but staff management of passengers and information was extremely poor - information updates had stopped after 2-3 hours rumours flew around because the one valiant ET staff member dealing with PAX was apparently instructed not to make further general announcements "for fear of a passenger revolt" - indeed they sent for the police and 4 officers remained with us for several hours! After a short night in a hotel arranged by ET we boarded the flight at midday next day - and then spent 2 hours sitting on plane apparently because they had forgotten to order a fresh supply of meals for the flight. So we reached Addis at midnight and spent another short night in a hotel there awaiting next day's connection. Summary - almost 48 hours from check-in at LHR to EBB with inadequate information. ET ground staff in London and the local agents clearly need training in handling unexpected problems and in communication passengers would be much less angry if adequate announcements are made and attempts at rebooking on alternative flights are handled in an orderly manner rather than priority being given to those who push hardest or make the most noise - I felt especially sorry for the 2 women carrying small children who received no attention at all in London.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Flew from Nairobi to Addis and then from Addis to Paris. The first leg of the flight was operated on a 767 with no inflight entertainment but legroom and comfort was average. Upon arrival in Addis I as well as other passengers were completely lost no info about connections and moreover staff at Bole international airport are very rude. No cell phone reception in the airport no wifi except in the business class lounge. On the second leg the extremely old 767 had no entertainment on a 7.5 hour flight seats were so cramped my knees pushed against the seat in front of me. I will not talk about the service because there was no service crew disappeared during the whole flight. On my way return I had to pay 500€ to get an upgrade to business class because I could not fly in economy. Business class seats were not even lie flat they just had a footrest.

Flew Addis to London yesterday on the Dreamliner. Superb experience throughout. Check in at Addis no queue Check in person could not have been more helpful. Plenty of loungers to pass the time in Terminal 2 departure areas. Reasonably priced cafes. Boarding was very civilized and politely controlled with the colour priority system. We left about 10 minutes late but arrived at Heathrow right on time. Cabin staff were courteous and helpful. Meal was excellent. Then we arrive at the super new Heathrow terminal 2. It took an hour to get to our bags only 3 staff on immigration at 9 in the morning. Bags were waiting for us. Ethiopian Airlines excellent Terminal 2 Heathrow - looks great service poor.

EBB-ADD 14 Sep ET332. ADD-BLZ 14 Sep ET877. BLZ-ADD 20 Sep ET877. ADD-EBB 20 Sep ET332. As a Star Alliance Gold member I often enjoy flying Star Alliance Partners and because I work often in Africa I fly Ethiopian regularly. However I do not look forward to flying the airline. In fact I dread it. The actual service of the airline staff is below average. It's very hard to get the attention of service crew and English or French is not widely spoken. My comments below refer mainly to the fact that Ethiopian consistently does not offer benefits to Star Alliance Gold members that it should. Priority Boarding: The airline consistently does not board Gold or Business Class members first when boarding flights. If they do have a priority boarding lane staff let anyone and everyone into it and do not verify their Gold or Business class status. So I must wait just as long in either lane. Lounge: The internet service food and sanitary conditions in the Gold lounge are horrendous. In the airport things are worse with men and women bathing in the restroom sinks.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I have been using ET regularly 3-4 times a year from Entebbe to Bangkok for 2 years now here are my opinions: 1) Check in counter: always crowded with tons of baggage especially BKK-ADD. You will spend at least 30-45 minutes in queue. 2) Baggage : So far I have never had any problems. 3) Staff: Friendly but not attentive. 4) Inflight entertainment: Very poor one big screen for whole of economy. Very poor quality earphones. 5) Seat Comfort: Well what can I say its ok for economy better than a low-cost carrier. 6) Food and Beverages: Food was great most of the time Beverages? You have to ask to be satisfied they do not provide food or drink menu so most of their expenses will be on juice water and wine. 7) Value for Money: For a moment they still the best although if their competitors were offering the same price I would definitely move. 8) Transit: No free internet crowded toilet crowded passengers at the security gate limited choice of restaurants one smoking room for whole transit passengers the less transit time in Addis the better.

I made the flight BRU-CDG-ADD followed by the flight ADD-KGL-BJM. The first step was made onboard the B787 ET- AOO. Very quiet flight with a very friendly and sympathetic cabin crew. The flight was almost full at Paris but I managed to stay alone at row 29 abc there were a lot of good seats available at the rear part of the B787. The seats were ok but a little 'tired' if I can say that! The dinner was simple overcooked and too salty - it was much better on my previous trip. For the breakfast just 3 small cookies and a madeleine nothing else! Long transit time at ADD and a quiet flight on a B737 to BJM. Excellent sandwich.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
IAD-ADD-LLW in Cloud Nine (Business) in July 2014. All flights on time and service was just fine. Good in flight entertainment on 777-300 ER with pitched lie flat seating on the IAD-ADD segment. ADD-LLW segment on 737NG had comfortable reclining seats with leg rests and no IFE. Food was plentiful and of good quality with a selection of Ethiopian dishes accompanied by injera as an additional course to the three mains on both segments. Crew was uniformly lovely. ADD is ok by developing world standards - a little confusing sort of dirty and not particularly enticing food or shopping options. Cloud Nine/Premium lounge crowded and unattractive with ok food and beverage options passable bathrooms and ok internet. The less time spent in ADD the better I think. Overall I was impressed with ET onboard product less so with the ADD hub (which I understand is due for an overhaul in the next few years).

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Travelled from IAD to ADD then to LSK on July 1 - absolutely the worst flight segments ever taken. The flight from IAD to ADD was 90 minutes late with no explanation given. Once onboard the plane (777-300ER) smelt foul and it was evident the plane had not had a good cleaning in ages. Being a Star Gold Member you would think preference would be given for upgrades however the lead cabin staff informed me that was not Ethiopians policy. Once airborne the inflight entertainment system was below average. The food and snacks were awful had the airline stated their food was below par I would have bought something at the airport. Finally the communication skills of the cabin crew and even the captain was below average. My return journey was equal if not worse than the first leg. Plane smelt windows in the plane had not been cleaned in ages it took a cabin crew member 1 hour 45 mins to realize my call light was on. I could not move due to the miserable 3-3-3 configuration. Overall I will never use Ethiopian again.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
This airline is one of two major airlines in East Africa. While they never lost my luggage that is about the only good thing I can say about this airline on which I flew over 30 segments due to my work. The airline attendants are chosen for their looks not their helpfulness or intelligence. The food is awful and the airplanes particularly the DSH-8 are old and noisy. They have obtuse rules - such as not allowing you to store your purse under the seat in front of you in an exit row. They do not prioritize luggage upon arrival and the gate agents don't seem to know what to do. Definitely not up to Western standards!

Flight was from Rome-Adis Ababa-Kilimanjaro and back. Very old planes (very 70s in the layout) plus very dirty (no soap and no towels at takeoff). I had both flights back to Rome without entertainment at all! Couldn't fit in the seat and staff service is very poor (I buzzed three different times but no one showed up to ask what I needed. I had to physically stop them when they passed through the corridors. Asked for something to drink but got nothing. Please choose another carrier!

BKK-SIN ET626. Foul is about the only way to describe it. Passengers joining in BKK have the pleasure of getting on a plane that has just flown for 8.5 hours from ADD and not been cleaned at all. It reeked and was boiling hot. Everyone had moved everywhere so seat assignments meant nothing. Bathrooms were filthy. Dirty used socks were in my seat pocket. Garbage was everywhere. No seat back AVOD. I didn't want to touch anything - couldn't wash my hands fast enough after getting off. Loud tinny music for all of the taxi and take off and for a good 15 mins afterward. Only pluses were that the fare was low and as a Star Alliance gold member I had a decent luggage allowance and could use the TG lounge in BKK. Otherwise I am amazed that ET is a Star Alliance member.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
We flew from Jo'burg to Addis in a brand new 777-300. Then to Stockholm in a 767-300. Although the latter was old it was as comfortable as could be. On the way back we were on an even older 767-300 with a totally failed ventilation system. It was extremely uncomfortable. 2 drunks on board during the extended stop in Vienna caused so much upset exacerbated by the heat. Finally the police came on board to remove one of them. The flight from Addis to Jo'burg was in a Dreamliner. The heroes are the ground staff at Addis Airport. They are endlessly patient and helpful. But the airport is a madhouse to the extreme. Why would a country allow it's flag carrier to grow so explosively and leave by all appearances the airport infrastructure behind? I would take them again because they offered the best deal.

March 2014. Addis to London on Dreamliner. Had full breakfast in the best value cafe in Terminal 2 at Bole this is the one in the back row of shops not the London cafe. When I came out of there the queue for gate security had increased hugely but they came to the back looking for us London passengers and speeded us through. Flight left a little late but arrived early. This was the Monday daytime flight. Amazing views all the way including the Alps. Flew into Heathrow via superb views of Crystal Palace FC and Twickenham Stadium. Food and service first class.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I flew to and from Nairobi and Addis and made two internal flights within Ethiopia. I was extremely disappointed with the airline: while it feels safe and the in-air experience is reasonable the ground experience at Addis Bole Airport is atrocious: was supposedly the international hub yet they had a single counter open for all ET flights (even after checking in at a kiosk I had to wait an hour in the heat with crying babies) seemingly under-trained staff and/or technical issues at check in completely chaotic baggage reclaim in Terminal 1; poor information and confusing signs. I also received SMS from the airline telling me my domestic flight had been delayed 3 hours and then that it had been cancelled - I therefore arrived 10hours late in Bahar Dar and missed my tour of the city. As it turned out the morning flight had run on schedule all along and with spare seats- yet another sign of the incompetence of the airline. I think the airline is very strong at marketing themselves as a serious international airline ('Proud member of Star Alliance' etc) when in fact it should work at sorting out basic logistics in its operations. Addis faces significant infrastructure problems at presents (including constant electrical interruptions) so no wonder this is a factor holding the airline back.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I recently flew IAD-ABB / ABB-IAD en route to Entebbe on a 777-200LR each way. The seats on both planes were worn out. There was zero cushion left and you could see the indentions where the padding had worn away. This made both flights agonizingly uncomfortable especially on the 17-hr return flight. Additionally my seat back entertainment screen did not work nor did the USB port. All plane interiors were dirty especially on the ADD-EBB route. I would not fly this airline again on a long haul flight.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
New spirit of Africa. A great slogan but one that the airline needs to earn if it is to mean anything. I took the flight from Addis to London on 2 May and as the time approached at which we should have been boarding there was an announcement that there would be a 2 hour delay; as a frequent business traveller I have no problem when this happens for mechanical or weather related reasons but I cannot find it in myself to be understanding when the reason turns out to be that no crew had been programmed and that we had to wait while the standby crew was activated. To add insult to injury I wrote to Ethiopian Airlines to complain and did not receive the courtesy of an acknowledgement.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Very bad service. I flew on route KUL-BKK. The cabin crew were not warm or welcoming whilst guiding me to my seat it seemed like they would rather be gossiping with their colleagues. During the meal service they offered two meal choices - fish and chicken. The cabin crew lacked service.

DXB-ADD-JNB. Check-in in Dubai: Horrendous. Disorganized and truly unfriendly check in agent. Airport Lounge: Staff friendly and helpful at best though choice of meals needs a spruce.

ADD-JNB: My seat failed to work - this was known to the crew hence alternatives should've been offered ASAP not to wait until the customer discovers it.

I flew IAD to ADD then from ADD to JIB. When I was at the airport in IAD I noticed many people had overly large bags and in large numbers and I had my one bag. The flight from ADD to IAD was nice and my luggage was with me. However the flight from IAD to ADD was not as nice. The flight attendants were not very attentive the second time around in the slightest and the movie selection was poor. Also when moving from ADD to JIB I noticed they were packing a great deal of peoples luggage and it looked like it all wasn't going to fit. I was right. When I arrived at my final destination I found they had not loaded my bag on my flight. I am military and I was supposed to return to my duty station upon my return. I am now being charged extra leave days due to this Airlines inability to keep track of luggage.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
JNB-ADD-DXB. Check-in: Average experience obviously not ET staff hence it lacks a bit as the lady servicing the queue seemed at odds at what was going on. Flight: Crew were fairly attentive. Again seat failed to work and I wasn't offered an alternative even though they mentioned that they were aware of the problem. Overall a good service made up by their great ability to just make your day. Transit: Efficient though the bus to and from the aircraft needs to be sorted out especially if you offer an exclusive coach for your J class customers. DXB sector: Standard affair though for a late night flight like this it would be better if you offered dinner with the lights dimmed or off.

A new fifth freedom (operating between two points outside an airlines home country) carrier on the trunk route from Singapore to Bangkok served by Boeing 767-300ER - an interesting and exotic way to get between these two cities. Cannot be booked on ET’s own site but codeshares with SQ and others and pops up on travel aggregator sites. Perhaps the difficulty in booking explained why there was only 40 people onboard despite the kind hospitality of the Ethiopian crew the tasty meal and the excellent flight times (BKK to SIN is 1425-1815 and SIN-BKK is 2245-0005+1). No entertainment to speak of although loud and diverse (military techno ethnic one after another!) played loudly during boarding taxi takeoff and climb (endearing rather than annoying). We arrived twenty minutes early into Suvunabhumi and my bags were on the carousel before I got there despite no lines at immigration. Will look out for this flight again.

Economy class LHR to ADD. I flew in economy class simply because of the direct flight convenience. I had very low expectation and it helped a lot. The airline is simply not up to international standard. The check-in at the LHR airport was a mess. Why they offer online check in which is not working is beyond me. At the end everybody had to check-in at the counter. The plane B777 is quite new so the seat and video are still in good condition. The food were abysmal that's all I can say. The IFE was average with pathetic earphone. The return flight was not much better.

My flight was meant to leave Nairobi at 5.40am and go via Ethiopia and on to London Heathrow. The flight from Nairobi to Addis was delayed by an hour and we sat on the runway waiting to take-off I had also been told that my connecting flight to London was delayed by 2 hours so at least I wasn't going to miss that. Landed in Addis and my second flight was still 2 hours delayed it was mayhem at the gate long queues at various desks and no instructions or announcements whatsoever to guide us. They gave me a new boarding pass I was now sitting right at the back in the middle not by the window as requested with my previous boarding pass. The lady next to me then said 'Are you getting off in Frankfurt or going straight to London?'. I was shocked this was meant to be a direct flight to London and no one had told us that we were now going through Frankfurt (to drop off people whose flights were cancelled the day before apparently). Landed in Frankfurt and let some people off all the rest of us going straight to London had to sit in the aeroplane for almost 2 hours waiting to take-off again! Landed in London at 6.30pm our bags didn't come out onto the carousel for over an hour. I went through arrivals at 8pm! So what was meant to be an 11 hour journey was 16 hours. Never again will I fly Ethiopian airlines.

LHR-ADD-(JRO)-MBA. Although the handling agent at Heathrow (Dnata) is clearly disinterested in giving any kind of customer service (opened check-in late very unprofessional in the way they spoke to passengers not dressed appropriately in uniform did not open Cloud Nine desk on time) this is not reflected in the attitude of the ET staff which was excellent throughout. We were made to feel very welcome onboard and the service was above a number of European airlines I have traveled recently on long-haul flights. There was a choice of meal in economy with wine or spirits. The service was generous and always available. If you wanted more you were made to feel welcome in the galley where you would be offered another drink etc. Special interest was the way the crew dealt with a passenger with disabilities. The adult passenger (who was being cared for by a family member) became quite agitated and at other times excited while on the flight. The crew were gentle and kind even giving the passengers some 'space' in the galley out of sight of others to re-group and calm down. IFE is on demand and there is plenty to choose from. Addis is not the best airport on earth with little to do however it beats other African hubs hands-down. No good restaurants to speak of and no lounge access to any card holders. An extra (unscheduled) stop was put upon us out of ADD. The onward flight also had good snacks and drinks although it was short and again a helpful and well presented crew. ET was a nice surprise and I will book with them again.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Nairobi to London. First leg in new 787 which was a joy to be in quiet airy and smooth with great views if you have a window seat. Choice of wine excellent and service superb. Second leg in older 777 still very comfortable seat extended enough to allow me to sleep without waking for a 6 hours. I have not used ET for about 5 years and their business class has come on leaps and bounds since then - more comfortable seats and better wine than a flight in business with Lufthansa to Chicago 4 weeks ago! The downside is the stopover in Addis. Addis Ababa airport really is not a great place to spend time and the business lounge certainly not up to European standards. With 5.5 hours between flights I had decided to get a transit visa and eat in town therefore I can't comment on the food served on board. Also I prefer to read rather than watch films so can't comment on the IFE. To conclude I have to be in Addis in about 8 weeks and will be delighted to use Ethiopian for this trip.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I flew on flight ET 811 from Addis Ababa to Entebbe on January 30. It was very frustrating. We were to fly at 10.55am but after several delays we lifted off at 8.45pm. The most frustrating aspect was there was no one in authority who could tell us what was happening or when we would actually fly. It appeared that airline employees were avoiding us as they knew we were getting frustrated and they had no good information. Occasionally one of the passengers would find an airline employee who would give them information which was always contradictory and always wrong. If there is an alternative I will not fly Ethiopian Airlines again!

BZV-ADD and a few days later ADD-CDG: I hadn't flown ET since they joined Star Alliance so I was pretty excited thinking they would now be at international standards. Well it is the exact contrary. Terrible experience on both flights from one end to the other even business with my Gold Star card. First if there is a lot of leg room the seat is terribly uncomfortable and old. Reminds me of seats 30 years ago. Cabin attendants gave no attention to passengers food was horrible entertainment even worse. The worst is that the cabin and the seats were truly dirty.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
JNB-ADD-NBO Feb 2014. Boeing 777-200 and 737 respectively. Ethiopian regional flights are at times problematic due to delays and deviating routings. This trip was delayed 1 hour from JNB. It had a previously un-announced deroute to ZNB where we had to pick up 100+ pax which had been waiting for ET for >5 hours. Thus they were hungry and angry. So were the pax from JNB so the situation became unfriendly and space was cramped. From ZNB ET had run out of food. Drinks provided. In JNB I was promised a hotel voucher at check in at gate at aircraft but it never came. The following morning ET801 ADD-NBO had a 4 hour delay! This is 2-3 times the flight duration and unacceptable. Reason given was aircraft service check. I assume they have too few aircraft's and it affects precision and operations terribly. Hot lunch was given in Addis in the waiting time that part functioned well (though basically only 1 option of food it was very tasty). On the plus side are the competitive prices but prices are on a stiff rise. If you have flexible time and do not expect a lot ET can be a pleasant surprise: ETs force is the many newer aircrafts the good service onboard the long duration of service onboard (from 10 minutes after take-off up till 10 minutes before landing). On regional sectors there are 4 options of hot food in economy and drinks flow. Special meals could be ordered and were on board but not always given out due to lack of staff follow up and due to peoples change of seating. FA's are young and co-operative. Call buttons rarely responded to but there are plenty of FAs. Transfer and hotel provided in Addis functioned perfectly. The de-routed flight JNB- ADD was announced by email (but after the flight took off). ET are trying but still not there.

However the aircraft was a bit old so seat comfort and the Inflight entertainment needs to be improved. Baggage handling by the airline is some what iffy most of the time.

London Heathrow UK to Entebbe Uganda return via Addis Ababa Ethiopia and Kigali Rwanda. I left on 16 Feb and returned on 20th Feb 2014. Flight numbers ET701 ET811 ET821 and ET710. A decent long haul flight brand new aeroplane good food plenty to drink good entertainment and attentive air hosts. Not the best I've ever flown with but by no means the worst.

ET-905 ET-688. 16 and 17 Jan 2014. I liked the service the air hostesses are very good at what they do. The food served was good as well. However the aircraft was a bit old so seat comfort and the Inflight entertainment needs to be improved. Baggage handling by the airline is some what iffy most of the time.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I took a flight from Abuja to Addis which was fine. Staff very friendly plane in a reasonably good condition schedule was great. Arriving in Addis the Airport is just outdated but once can mange this. Going to the next flight to Dubai and it happened. Boarded the plane waiting for 2 hours and then change of Aircraft due to engine issues. Consequently we arrive 3 hours late in Dubai and I missed my connection. I am surprised that an airline with brand new aircraft's (787 Dreamliner) quite good and friendly staff is able to upset travelers by not being able to stick to a schedule. Since its not the first time I am not pleased and would try to avoid Ethiopian in future.

DXB-ADD-FRA on their 787. Flying the Dreamliner is always a great experience for me and ET didn't disappoint. Only issue is the seats don't have too much storage space and are not true lie flat. Put a book in the little nook by the seat and when I woke up the book was under the seat. Had to lift out cushions to reach it because of the shell. Service was good. Food was good as well.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I flew Mumbai to Lagos and back on Ethiopian. First leg of return leg (Lagos to Addis) was in a 777-200 but the individual TV screens were not working. With a stopover at Addis for only 30 min the airline handled baggage transfer quite efficiently. In the second leg (Addis to Mumbai) aircraft was suddenly changed from a planned 777-200 to an old 767-300 without personal Inflight Entertainment. Chaotic for people as seat numbers had to be reworked due to different seating configuration. Time for Star Alliance to step in and fix some basic norms.

NBO-ADD-JNB on February 12 and 13 respectively. All flights on time FA's active and caring. Almost unlimited drinks and food if requested. Service very good and began 10 min. after takeoff until 10 minutes before touchdown. ET provided unexpectedly hotel in ADD“Panorama. Transfer to and from hotel were quick and smooth. Drinks and meals also included. Aircraft's were in good condition and clean. Went by Boeing 737-800 and 777-200 respectively. On first leg only offered cold meal. On 2nd leg offered 2 choices of hot meals. Gate-procedures in ADD crowded and very uncomfortable. IFA not a priority neither for me nor the airline.

JNB-ADD. This flight was scheduled to depart at 14.20. It left the gate late taxied out to the runway and then announced a mechanical problem. We sat on the runway for 1.5 hrs. We were then told that we would be disembarked and returned to the terminal. A bus took us to international transfers and dumped us at the entrance. It was now about 17.00. No airline representative was present and after about 40 minutes with no information passed contract ground staff indicated that we should go to a distant departure gate. No other details were given. Arriving at the gate there was still no information given but meal vouchers were offered with a promise of new information at some unspecified time. By 20.00 ground staff were as tight-lipped as ever with no apologies and no airline representatives in sight. At this point I wanted off this flight. I cancelled my flight and went home.

MBA-ADD-BOM-ADD-MBA B737-800NG - B777-300ER and B777-200LR - B737-800. The outbound flight was ok. The AVOD was not updated movies were old and had very few options. Food was good. The FA's were very ignorant to calls and behaved like they couldn't hear a thing also had no smiles on their faces. Inbound flight was ok same problem with the FA's as the inbound flight. The aircraft was changed from ADD to MBA and had to check in my hand luggage after which I didn't get it in MBA until the next day.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
LHR-ADD on 9 Jan 2014 - I flew using Business class both directions the flight takeoff and landing was smooth with new Dreamliner Boeing 787 and the arrival in Addis Ababa was earlier than the expected scheduled time. In my opinion the food quality was nice. In every other category this airline is well above standard. It begins with the crew who provides an excellent customer service experience. The cleanliness of the aircraft was noticeable the toilets were kept clean and the staff were genuinely friendly on both directions.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I had used Ethiopian Airlines several times to get to Africa and I used to like the service on board and usually connections at their Addis Ababa hub. However the ground service is very poor and unfriendly and seat selection is not respected as they keep changing aircraft types and configurations. Today I had finished a trip: Ground staff were in both ways the most unfriendly people I have seen (particularly in London and Pointe Noire Congo). My flights were delayed risking missing my connections my seat choice was never respected and the interior of the planes was particularly dirty. They added stops (my flight from Pointe Noire made a stop in Libreville adding flight time and shortening connection time. Will never use this airline again.

Travel in December 2013 in Nairobi via Addis Abba to Zanzibar route the first full flight a 767 old narrow seats but friendly staff and good food service. The transit in Addis Abba was fast. Flight Nairobi to Zanzibar via Dar es Salaam: left on time good food and friendly assistance. A good experience.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Washington to Addis and back in January 2014. This was my second time on Ethiopian and I thought it was significantly worse than my previous trip 2 years ago. In both directions my headset worked in only one ear so it was almost impossible to watch movies. In both directions by my arrival the cabin and restrooms were absolutely filthy I assume there weren't enough flight attendants to keep up with the trash. On the way back in addition to the headset being broken my touch screen didn't work and the pocket on the front of the seat broke. The food is mediocre. The Addis airport is chaos as always the check-in wait was extremely long and seemed very disorganized with people randomly jumping in and out of line and staff abruptly leaving their posts. In addition it seems ridiculous in this day and age to make a stop in Rome for refuelling since many airlines fly such long routes without any stops. Combined with the fact that this itinerary was no cheaper (in fact it was priced slightly higher) than a comparable trip on Emirates which I expect to have premium service I won't be taking Ethiopian again.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
FRA-ADD-JNB. Planes were 787 and 777 with new seats. USB power plug and personal TV were useful. All flights were on time. Cabin crews were helpful and friendly. Improving points were reservation center staffs and ground handling. I contacted reservation centers in Addis Ababa several times by e-mail with a quick answer. Addis Ababa airport is chaos. I really felt that ground staff tried to take care of passengers but absolutely too many passengers for the number of staff. Security control line at gates was so long. more than 30min waiting. After security control nothing at gates except WC.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Rome-Addis-Maputo and back. I can say that it is a good rtip considering the price differential. The flights left near the schedule (not greater than 15 minutes late) the food was great (truly Ethiopian I thought it great) and staff polite. What I really disliked was the space between the seats tighter than usual with a poor maintenance service and poor entertainment options not user friendly at all. Long story short my impression was positive. The company can improve a lot its service but it is an interesting alternative for those who want to save money flying. Do not expect luxury great movies or French food on the menu.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Harare - London via Addis with a 10 hour stop over with 2 children 5 and 7 years. The plane went through Lusaka and on 2 occasions my children were turned away from the toilets as the plane was fuelling in the end I just had to barge into the loo with my youngest. On arrival in Addis we waited for over an hour before we were given vouchers for Beshale hotel. The next days flight on the London leg didn't leave on time and the sticker system was pointless as those of us at the back did not hear or understand what the crew were saying.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Johannesburg to Bangkok via Addis and back. Check in: Slow and farcical - both in Johannesburg and Bangkok. Slow system. Automatically change seats booked on internet. No system in Addis. You queue for about an hour to get a sticker of a certain colour according to which you board but when you board everyone boards. Planes: Ethiopian brags hugely about its new fleet. The plane from Johannesburg to Addis may have been newish but the floors were dirty the trays had old food on them the individual TV screens scratched and its sound appalling. The flight from Addis to Bangkok was on a very old plane. No individual TV screens massively uncomfortable seats. I was shocked that such a plane is still used. Hub: The Bole International Airport in Addis is supposed to be a hub but it is a mere shell. Three restrooms serve it there are no lounges (just Ethiopian Airlines related) not enough seats. Staff: Some rude. Verdict: it is an insult to Star Alliance. Avoid it at all costs.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
We flew Ethiopian on our honeymoon. When I booked the flight I noticed the short connection time in Addis Ababa and queried this with Ethiopian. I was assured that it would not be a problem. On flight day our flight leaving Johannesburg was late and therefore we missed out connection. When we arrived we were told to join a mob of about 80 other people that had also missed connections. Our flight only flew once a day so we were put in a hotel and given a transit visa. Not ideal for first night of honeymoon. As a result of the 24 hour delay we missed another flight that we had to rebook out of our own pocket. All those that were delayed in Addis were promised a USD300 compensation voucher. There was about 30 of us waiting for compensation as we were boarding the airplane to Mumbai. The Ethiopian staff disappeared and came back with vouchers for some customers. They then left and returned with some more vouchers. We were then boarded and again more customers received vouchers. At this point I was personally promised that they were coming back with a voucher for myself. They didn't come back before the plane took off. At the time I was just relieved to be on our way to our destination but you can understand that I'm not happy about some customers receiving compensation and me and my wife not receiving. When we arrived in Mumbai that had also lost our bags. We are back home and don't intend to fly Ethiopian ever again. Overall the worst flying experience I've ever had.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Flew from ADD to BKK no inflight entertainment not even headphones. Seat cushion was totally detached with upholstery torn. Aircraft was tattered and filthy. The flight back was cancelled due to mechanical failure on the aircraft NO Ethiopian Airline representatives on Bangkok airport. No communication or explanation from the airline for hours. More than twelve hours have passed with no status update. Avoid this airline at all costs.

Toronto - Addis - Nairobi and back. Flights were good. Food was also good. Entertainment was poor as there was no change on flight back (2014). The outbound flights were in 2013 (Dec) - I expected a completely new set of movies etc.. One word of caution the flight from Addis to Nairobi was on a very old 777 (broken trays and seat backs).

I travelled Kenya to India. Flight from Nairobi to Addi Abbas was behind schedule. Onboard the flight it was very warm and uncomfortable people were using papers to fan themselves. No good food or entertainment. Flight from Addi Abbas to Mumbai had similar problems. When coming back from Mumbai to Addi Abbas everything was excellent.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Went to Addis Ababa round-trip from Toronto for a business trip! Got the opportunity to fly Business Class or should I say Cloud Nine both ways! Plane was a fairly new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Flight ran an hour late due to ground issues. Food was great. Staff were friendly. Inflight Entertainment could have more choices instead of just 85 channels. But I wouldn't complain as I only used it once and would be on my laptop or asleep for the entire flight. The nice lie-flat seats were my favorite part of the airplane. On the way back it was via Rome another Dreamliner. We left on time from Addis Ababa but for some reason left late from Rome. Wish the flight attendants could fulfil passengers request for turning on the A/C because the plane was smoking hot when in Rome. Same thing as the flight to Ethiopia good food and friendly staff. Ethiopian Airlines never fails to disappoint me with their friendly service! Looking forward to flying them again!

1 Nov 13 EA 501 Washington DC to Addis Ababa on Dreamliner. 29 Nov 13 EA 815 Addis Ababa to Kilimanjaro Tanzania. 10 Dec 13 EA 814 Kilimanjaro Tanzania to Addis Ababa. 10 Dec 13 EA 500 Addis Ababa to Washington DC on “Dreamliner. All travel in Economy. The worst flying experience my wife and I have had in over 50 years. Flight to Addis was a nerve racking 15 hours of shrieking children. Parents made little if any effort to control their children. Flight staff were non responsive and did nothing. Repeated requests to be relocated met with indifference and non-responsiveness. Entire flight staff were unsmiling. Dreamliner was more of a nightmare - the cabin was hot. The power ports for computers did not work. In fact the inflight entertainment system did not work at the start of the flight. Food barely edible. Once in Bole Airport it took 1.5 hours for bags to be off loaded. Flight to Kilimanjaro followed a similar pattern. Provided WITH misinformation sending us to the wrong departure terminal. Had to go through security twice and rush to another terminal to catch our flight. Conditions were chaotic with no support personnel the airline. Another aircraft full of screaming unruly children. Flight back to Addis Ababa was another disaster. The flight we were booked on arrived an hour late and during this time no Ethiopian Airline employee was available to provide any information. Our previously confirmed seats were not available on check in despite having a long-standing confirmed reservation. Arrived late in Addis and had to rush to make our connecting flight to Washington DC. Again no help and were put on the wrong bus. Dreamliner flight back to Washington DC was again a nightmare experience. Even fuller with uncontrolled children. The crew were even surlier more incommunicative and more negative than on the initial flight. Impossible to sleep or relax. Although other seats were available all requests to be moved were refused.

Saudi Arabia Riyadh to Ethiopia then transit to Johannesburg the same route when coming back. I'm very disappointed with ongoing flight cancellations very disorganised unreliable and getting worse instead of improving. No entertainment very filthy with ugly marks on every seat. The airport in Ethiopia is overcrowded with a lot of people pushing each other - not organized at all. I will never use this airline and I would discourage anyone from using it.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
For the price the service say is ok. By market standards comparing with the competitors like British Airways Emirates etc the service is way below standard. I took the 8.15pm flight from Heathrow. My destination was Entebbe but we had to go via Addis Ababa. We were meant to leave Addis Ababa at 10.15am but we left at 12.08 implying that were delayed for 2hrs. We got no communication from them about the delay until after 40mins. They just stood outside chatting! Surely if this is the way Ethiopia is leading Africa then it means Africa will never move on.

The airline is very punctual efficient up to standards and above compared to a lot of failed airlines in the world. Fast growing with modern technologies including Dreamliner with smiling flight attendants.

ET 619 KUL-BKK 22 Nov 2013 Boeing 767. First and last time I will fly Ethiopian Airways. I choose ET because it is a Star Alliance member. No mobile application for check-in. No self check-in kiosk at the airport. At the counter I got my BP after 10 minutes waiting because of the slow system. On board: broken seat screen under average clean seat and overhead bin not providing arrival card for Thai immigration. Cabin crew trying to be nice but when you ask something they were unresponsive and rude. I asked for coffee after finished my tea and was served the coffee unwillingly. During the taxi all CC were roaming around and they didn't care that some passengers were on the phone. Food was good and tasty even though there was no fork and tissue pack on the tray.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
We were supposed to be flying on Ethiopian airlines from the Seychelles on 1st Nov 2013. However due to "a slight mechanical problem" the flight was delayed for 48 hours. They refused to rebook us on other flights and kept us waiting for 2 whole days. No update on the situation was given the staff were rude insensitive no one apologized for the delay even more no one bothered to care. They simply disappeared from sight. On the second day they actually took us back to the airport and let us wait there for 7 hours before telling us that the plane had not been fixed yet. All in all we had to spend more than 20 of those 48 hours at the airport. I guess it's fine as long as there are no problems but they are terrible when things go wrong. I'll never fly Ethiopian airlines again. Why they are a member of Star Alliance is a mystery to me.

Outbound 03/11/2013 ET701 LHR-ADD 11K. Was flying home very last minute as my mother died very suddenly. The Dnata ground crew were great on check in and gave me a quiet seat as requested. I had to travel with assistance as was meant to start chemo on 04/11/2013 and all was okay until an hour after take off. I went to the loo and found about 20 people waiting the reason three toilets were broken on board leaving only four for over 200 pax! On arrival at ADD no wheelchair and we disembarked via stairs Left on tarmac waiting for bus for 20 mins. At the terminal I was told to find my own wheelchair. On boarding my flight to Ndola ET871 the escalator was broken so was carried down backwards. Lift to plane was broken so had to wait to board and was last on. Again crew were great. 12/11/2013 ET871 NLA-ADD and ET700 ADD-LHR. Flight 871 was fine but again on arrival at ADD no wheelchair. The cabin crew off 871 ended up finding me a wheelchair and wheeling me themselves. After complaining I was allowed me to use the business class lounge for my 5 hour transit. All I needed was to be able to sit in a quiet place. On boarding ET700 I found the seat to be broken and very uncomfortable. The crew were great but in the end they are let down by ageing 767 300ERs that have seen better days. It was like flying in the 80's especially as there was only overhead TV entertainment showing French films to and from London!

Just returned from a trip to Tanzania. All 4 flights were on time excellent service on check-in excellent inflight service on all the flights. Our luggage did not connect with us from ADD to Kilimanjaro but made it on the next flight. Excellent communications between tour company and airline to get our luggage to us. They are completing a new airport in ADD so their claim to be the hub in eastern Africa is on its way.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Flew Ethiopian from Kigali to Paris with the Paris connection in Addis. Upon arriving in Addis I learned that I had been routed through Stockholm with an insane 1 hour stop at 2.30am in Cairo! Despite there being plenty of business class availability on the Addis - Paris direct flight Ethiopian airport staff claimed they could not move me. Quite frankly I have not seen a more inept and unhelpful airport operation in a very long time. They aggressively push their star alliance affiliation but claim to have no ability to access star alliance reservations etc. Infuriating. Business class in flight service as good was fantastic but Ethiopians 767-800 business class seating is terrible - especially for a 9 hour flight with an hour stop in Cairo. Never fly this route on these planes.

My family and I were flying from the US to Kenya via Addis Ababa. The layover in Addis Ababa was terrible: long lines through security; long lines waiting for our tickets to be printed crowded poor communication for travelers that were waiting for connection flights and generally poor technical service. Long story short we almost missed our flight. The aircraft was literally waiting for us to board. Our tickets had not been printed out. One of the airline ticket collector had to leave their post and quickly write out our names on sheets of ticket paper. Other than that the aircraft ride was good. Shaky worn out seats but relatively comfortable. We had been given the front-most seats closest to the exit. The best part of it all was the food! Honestly I felt that going through all that hassle and to get to eat what the kind and demure hostesses gave us was worth it. Well cooked unfrozen good filling tasty organic food!

I was on the same flight from Seychelles to Addis Ababa on 1 November. Apart from leaving us so much time at the airport (25 hours in 3 days) we only got a coupon from drinks after asking and filling an official complaint to a police officer.We were told that we would be contacted to get a compensation from our office in Belgium but after I made contact myself up to now all I got was an excuse that the person dealing with his is on holiday. Worst thing after we were already 2 days late they remove us from the hotel at 11 am to save on the room cost just to sit in the airport to look at the checkin counter who opened only 2 hours later.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Things are OK as long as things go right. As soon as something goes wrong this airline fails miserably. We were leaving Seychelle Islands when the plane had to turn back. they knew it could not be fixed but left us waiting for hours at airport before sending us to hotels. Next day we went back but the same thing happened again. We were not well informed and left in the dark most of the time in updates. 48 hours we waited in total before another plane came to get us. We were also not compensated for our wait. The flight crew tried their best and were nice but their superiors are the problem. On the flight out we went to a supervisor at Addis Ababa to tell about our problems but he was rude and uninterested. Never will I fly with them again.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
14 years ago due to bad experiences I stopped travelling. After the airline joined Star Alliance I thought things would change. Food - all 4 Sectors (Lubumbashi-Addis Addis-Seychelles Seychelles-Addis Addis-Lubumbashi) had the same food (Mashed Potato Chicken Beans) for my 3yrs old daughter and dry chicken for myself. Inflight entertainment: same program runs for 1 hour on all the segments. Baggage if one see the Addis airport one can imagine how the airline would be handling the baggage. I lost my baggage on my return trip. Why Star Alliance have accepted Ethiopian Airlines is a mystery.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
The way good airlines are distinguished from bad ones is how they deal with unexpected events. I missed my connection flight from Addis Ababa to Kuwait and that happens. But for them to make minimum effort to attend to passengers missing their connection flights and pay no attention to customer satisfaction is unacceptable. They offered me the most uncomfortable alternative itinerary the one that is most convenient and cheapest for them with no consideration to my inconvenience. Also had to pay from my own pocket to make the route easier. Addis Ababa airport staff are extremely rude and there is no escaping being subject to their rudeness since you have to ask around for your connection gate as there are no clear directions at the poorly facility that is their airport. I would rather pay extra for Emirates and guarantee a respectable treatment when things go wrong.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
They don't have it together. Seats seem narrow compared to other airlines and pitch seemed smaller than most. Plane stopped in Rome to change crew! Who ever heard of that these days! There were no such stop on the outbound flight. This was a Boeing Dreamliner the new plane. Rome stop was not disclosed on ticket. While stopped in Rome one flight attendant told me I had to unbuckle my seat belt! The flight attendants did serve lots of food. We flew with Ethiopian from Washington DC to Kilimanjaro Tanzania Africa. It was a long flight and physically uncomfortable. The flight from Kilimanjaro to Addis was on a Boeing 767 which was way more comfortable and helped me verify the comparison. The pilots and/or PA system made English announcements that were unintelligible.

TLV-ADD-LOS. B737-800. TLV-ADD 1am departure. You would think they would be in a rush to serve the food and let everyone sleep. Not so. Lights turned on after takeoff for a lengthy 2 hours to serve dinner to a half full flight. Only 2 FA's in Y class. Bathrooms in the back not stocked. Constant lines I can't imagine when it's full. Only 2 toilets for a whole cabin. FA's very nice and gentle. Very good selection of drinks and very generous. Food tasty. ADD-LOS on ancient B767-300. Gate was changed twice and hundreds of people were running from gate to gate in the mad rush that ADD airport is early in the morning. Last minute aircraft change caused chaos with seat changes and passengers were still standing looking for open seats when the plane was already taxiing. Good food attentive gentle service again generous bar service. After touch down in Lagos passengers were getting up opening overhead bins while plane was still taxiing. Would not listen to FA requests to remain seated.

NBO-ADD-NBO onboard Boeing 737-800. New aircraft(s) and both flights almost full. They allocated first windows and aisles seats and then fill up the middle seats for those checking in late. Service FAs and catering generally good. First leg three food options. Various juices Carlsberg beer and red and white wine on mini- bottles offered. Both flights delayed almost 1 hour at departures and at arrivals only 30 minutes (as flight-time is over budgeted likely in an attempt to disguise delays). No individual flight entertainment and earphones only provided on the outbound leg. Homebound only offered chicken as hot meal no other option. Gates crowded and calls for boarding by far too early at both departures causing many pax were trapped in narrow gate area 1-1½ hour prior to departure. Few were aware they could leave the gate area once “boarded”. However in Addis that would imply passing security once more and quite some additional walking.

Niamey-Abuja-Addis-Nairobi. First leg on ASky code share with ET. Refused check-in at Niamey staff claimed I had no booking. I had a printout and had checked online the previous day. Discussions were going back and forth but staff insisted I was not booked. I refused to leave the counter until they showed me the full passenger manifest my name was number 4 on the list. Suddenly there was no problem checking in. Flight with ASky good on a fresh Q400 Next Generation. Small breakfast (various breads) served. Transfer in Abuja Nigeria another hustle transit passengers were taken to the terminal and after 30 minutes a staff member came and asked for our passports and bookings and he would come back with boarding passes for next flight to Addis. He came back and the requested aisle seats were given. Flight on a B777-200 was OK AVOD worked fine and cabin staff friendly. Choice of food was down to beef stew only and it was not to my taste. Addis Ababa - standard chaos in the remote gate upon boarding. PA system at this airport barely audible. Bad signage at the gates staff not friendly. Addis-Nairobi on 737-700 hot meal served on this short flight at 23.15. My bag did not arrive. I got an SMS on Sunday it was to be collected at the airport. ET may be offering fair prices it seems but somewhere down the line they are cutting the service short and you end up sacrificing half a day collecting the bag they lost. Transit time in all locations were more than 2 hours.

4 different Ethiopian Airlines flights during the last month. First from Toronto to Addis Ababa was scheduled to leave 1 hour before the time stated on my e-ticket. Fortunately we were there on time. Then we sat on the tarmac for an hour while they fixed something in the cockpit. Once in the air we discovered that we were headed for Rome despite the fact that our e-ticket stated it was a direct non-stop flight from Toronto to Addis. Next flight was from Addis to Nairobi and it too left 45 minutes late but no reason was given for this. On the way home we had a non-stop direct flight from Kilimanjaro to Addis. Arrived at the airport to learn that the flight was going via Zanzibar! Assured we would still make our connection in Addis to another ET flight to Washington and that they would hold the flight for us if we were late. Flight left Kilimanjaro 50 minutes late yet we were still assured that they would hold the plane in Addis for all the people on the flight who wanted to make the same connection. Arrived in Addis to find that they had not held the plane for us! We stood in a crush of people at the ET counter for an hour and a half. They rescheduled our flights for 24 hours later and sent us to a hotel for the night. It was 3am by the time we got there. Never again.

FRA-ADD in business. Plane was full business class seats are of the old style and not lie flat which is fine. Service leaves a lot to be desired told the stewardess upon boarding I wished to sleep but got woken up to be asked for dinner.

ADD-JNB onboard the 787 Dreamliner. Flight delayed 3 hours due to delayed incoming flight from Toronto - communicated well on the airport screens and also whilst onboard. Boarding was an utter shambles - passengers queuing for an hour to get a sticker on their boarding pass - and no fast lane evident for C pax. Once onboard really enjoyed the usual excellent service from the crew who allowed me to sleep for the first few hours and served food on demand - although a comment from the senior stewardess that 'she will not get any rest' was not appreciated - and went against the attitude from all her colleagues who could not have done more to assist. Ethiopian food onboard was lovely - and the Norwegian salmon starter was good too as was white whine and fruit and cheese offerings. Entertainment very poor with poor selection across the board - and a lot of passengers due to the 3 hour delay in Addis had missed connecting flights with Star Alliance partner (South African Airways) and no-one was there to assist in re-booking on missed flight connections - which led to a near riot at the terminal in Johannesburg once we had collected luggage and cleared immigration.

LHR-ADD in packed overbooked brand new Dreamliner 787. As a frequent flyer on ET really pleased to see the impact of brand new planes on the seat comfort cabin baggage space lighting control and finally PVT. Flight left Heathrow on-time and early arrival into Addis. Food options limited to a poor fish dish - and passengers not happy to be woken up at 5 a.m. for a 'continental breakfast' which was one small cold croissant. No white wine served for economy class passengers. Despite finally having PVT in their new planes it was hugely disappointing to see movie selection being outdated limited and very poor compared to similar airlines offering this service. Staff couldn't do more for passengers - and dealt with some difficult passengers very well.

Typically the airline never fails to disappoint. I Flew KUL-BKK. Our flight was rescheduled from a 23.25 flight to 01.25 for no reason whatsoever. We had pre allocated EMEX seats however on boarding our boarding passes flashed as "not correct seats" and once on board we found that we were actually 2 rows behind the exit! As usual the crew insisted on serving a meal at 2am even though everyone just wanted to sleep for the short flight. On arrival we had to wait at immigration for 15 minutes as no arrival cards were provided on board and there were none left at the airport on arrival.

It really depends on luck. HKG-BKK-ADD on a dilapidated 767 ET-AME in Y with body repainted in total white without logo and livery. No PTV. Things broken here and there. Delayed for a whole 3 hrs on departure. FA call bell kept beeping continuously so pax got so annoyed and the FA did not know/had no way to stop it and eventually packed some tissue paper with tape over the speaker! FA's did not answer any calls at all! This is definite the worst flight in my life! Subsequent legs ADD-JRO DAR-ADD ADD-HKG were on more modernized 767 and 737 planes. ADD-HKG even got PTV - what a surprise! FA's were more friendly and helpful as well.

FRA via ADD to Kilimanjaro and back from Dar Es Salaam with Ethiopian in business class (unfortunately fully paid by us not an upgrade or anything). 3 of 4 legs were flown on Airbus 767-300 of very senior age correspondingly they had no or inadequate inflight entertainment systems. Service was okay and reasonably attentive on two legs (ADD-KIL and ADD-FRA). On FRA-ADD it was inattentive and sloppy we were served our food with plastic cutlery food was indelible. Worst of all: DAR-ADD serviced by a Bombardier turboprop instead a small Boeing flight took nearly 4 hours instead of 2 hrs 40 mins no inflight entertainment our allocated seats were occupied until stop- over in Zanzibar virtually no service (one glass of water and we are still talking business class) no leg room nothing. Pillows/blankets: we had the choice to pick up the leftovers from the previous flight from the floor have none at all. Two flight attendants of which one sitting down in an empty seat and sleeping.

Have flown twice the same route within a year. JNB - Addis - Bangkok - Hong Kong and return. Service in Johannesburg very good with very nice shongololo lounge. Flight on a B737 nothing spectacular service good departure with a small delay. Addis to BKK and HKG were both disappointing flights. First time I flew this route we boarded an even older B757 which needed a refuelling stop in Djibouti. Second time I flew the same route it was on one of the old B767's. On both these flights business class seats were from the old style seats not even used by European airlines in economy+. Service was done with a smile but food quality and presentation extremely poor. Lounge in Addis very poor and overcrowded lounge in HKG is a real shame. You pay for what you receive. I do not think I will be flying them any time soon for the same rate as they charge I can receive much better service with many other airlines.

Frankfurt (FRA) to Zanzibar (ZNZ) with Addis Ababa stopover. Unfortunately I could not board my initial flight as the flight was overbooked and the local airline staff very unqualified. It came as a big surprise to me that the flight was overbooked as we had verified our seating numbers on our tickets just days before the flight. As such I will not travel again with ET as this was a very disappointing experience.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I have been travelling business class from Bangkok via Addis Ababa to Harare and return. To be honest this was just at the time when the Dreamliners got grounded so 3 out of the 4 legs have been flown on antiquated planes. The crew were rather indifferent drinks were poor on all legs food was more like economy class and the seat comfort was not amazing given the age of the planes. ET did a very bad job with the mileage: I got credited for miles on 3 legs but not on the Bangkok-Addis one although all flights had the same booking class. For me this is the last time I fly with such an airline with whom I already had one year ago terrible trouble for misdirected luggage.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
There are two versions of Ethiopian Airlines. Version A is a dilapidated one with frayed edges and a cabin crew to match. Version B is an ultra modern one flying Dreamliners. I had the opportunity to try both versions on my recent flight from Kuwait to Johannesburg. The first leg KWI-ADD was Version A and the second leg ADD-JNB was Version B. The two versions compete favourably for the top positions on either end of the spectrum of airlines servicing the African Continent.

J/Business class (seat 2-L) ET 688 (Addis - New Delhi) on 15th June 2013. The Business class washroom was deprived of basics! Even the liquid soap or soap-bar was missing for the first 5 hours of the 6 hours flight. The Sr. Stewardess of the flight was rude in her behaviour with business class passengers serving food in a very pointed and rude manner. Having boarded the total of 6 hours flight at 12 midnight in Addis and the flight was scheduled to land in Delhi at 9.10 am they served breakfast meal in the middle of the night. The special meal request (for AVML) was made at the time of booking the seats yet the meal served was neither AVML and nor was it sufficient as a "hot meal". The much promised and advertised travelers-kit should have various items in it these include ear-plus lip-balm hair-brush etc. None of these items were available in the kit nor were they provided when asked for. In nutshell this was indeed an awful experience which we would hope not to face again.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
LGW-ADD return in economy. Flight was on an ancient 767 both ways. Interior and fittings looked tired and the IFE non existent. Both outbound and return were night flights which I hate. Outbound was about half an hour early and return would have been the same if we did not fly around London waiting for Heathrow. Despite the age of the aircraft the seats were among the most comfortable I have sat in for a long time and the leg room was also very good. I really could not ask for any more on a night flight.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
DC to Addis to Lusaka and return flights Lusaka to Addis to DC. Travel to Lusaka was uneventful. On the return trip the flight from Lusaka was delayed at least 3 times - waited at the gate after going through 2 security checkpoints only to be told to return to the terminal because our flight was delayed again. In total flight was over 4 hours late. I missed my connecting flight in Addis to DC and then connecting flight in the US. I was 'rebooked' on a different airline only to find that I would have had to leave the connecting city before I actually arrived! I ended up staying in a hotel overnight and making the same flights the following day. My connecting flight in the US unfortunately was also scheduled to leave before I arrived on the international flight. It was very frustrating interacting with the Ethiopian staff/representatives because they did not seem to care nor did they apologize for their mistakes.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
MCT-ADD-LBV return in Business. First 3 sectors on 737-700 and last sector on 737-800. Everything ran on time. Connecting in ADD very easy and the lounge initially busy but found a seat and quietened down after 30 mins when the morning rush was over. Lounge almost to myself on return leg. All sectors had really good FA's. Not in your face but always attentive when you wanted them to be. Personally I found the food/drink to be not too bad I've certainly had much worse. The beer was very nice. The seat although the older style was perfectly comfortable for the length of flights. the planes themselves were either brand new or only maybe a couple of years old. The only downside was the very poor IFE. Small main screen with pretty poor movies but I prepared for that and had plenty movies on my tablet and books on the kindle. All in all for the price pretty good and would use them again without hesitation.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
DAR-ADD-NBO. Flights briefly on time. First leg was a Boeing 319. Good food. IFE shared mini-TV ceiling monitors not so interesting. Good care of passengers by FAs. 2 hot food options both were tasty and exotic. Call bells attended to. Second leg the 4th Dreamliner procured by Ethiopian: advanced aircraft free wifi and power outlet. Manual controls of window shading strength (like sunglasses) worked perfectly. Seats were surprisingly cramped and narrow not spacious. Aircraft almost full. Staff did their best to service all passengers. Call-buttons responded to moderately. Food absolutely edible Italian pasta with Ethiopian spiced chicken came out well. Served French land-wines in mini bottles tolerable though no options beyond white and red. Soft drinks plenty and 2 beers offered (Carlsberg and Heineken). IFE worked easy to manoeuvre buttons. IFE kept running until aircraft standstill and pax were permitted to use earphones till the end. Personal screens personal choice of movies etc. Footrests nice. Quiet aircraft: Only wind-noise were heard and easy to talk with other pax. I would give 7 points for 1st trip and 9 points for 2nd hence the total score become 9.

FRA-ADD-FRA. Great flights on the way there we flew the 767 which was a bit old but very comfortable and the hostesses were very nice too. Flight back was on the Dreamliner which was wonderful. Unlike what other people say Bole Airport in Addis is perfectly good the staff are helpful plenty of shops although not as many as in other major EU or US airports.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
FRA to ADD on 27 April 2013 and back after 3 weeks in Ethiopia on 18 May 2013. Flight from FRA to ADD was a night flight with B767-300 which was rather old and many things were broken but still nice and comfortable. Service was good as well as the evening meal served to us. Flight was late but only because of heavy traffic at Frankfurt Airport. In the morning before landing at 6.15 we received rather disappointingly only juice and a sort of muesli bar. Not really any in-flight entertainment. You can listen to music and watch a film from TV screens. Otherwise a good and comfortable flight. On the flight back were waiting to fly with the brand new B787 Dreamliner but to our disappointment it was a old B757-200. Luckily it was only half full and we could take a row of three seats to ourselves! Excellent and friendly service on board! After takeoff we were served a drink and a muffin and a couple of hours later a lunch. The staff kept serving drinks all through the flight! Nice day flight from Addis Ababa to Frankfurt. Same kind of in-flight entertainment as on the way to Addis Ababa.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Took 2 domestic flights Addis Ababa to Lalibela (via Bahir Dar) and Lalibela to Gonder. Both good smooth flights. Snack (drink and sandwich) served on the leg Addis Ababa to Bahir Dar. The other legs too short for a snack and didn't even need one to be honest. Some heavy turbulence on the flight from Lalibela to Gonder but apparently this happens of during the midday flights over the mountains. Planes (Bombardier Dash Q400) in good condition and clean!

Traveled From Washington D.C. to Addis Ababa Ethiopia on May 2 2013. This was my second flight with this airline. I also used this airline in February 2013. The staff food and entertainment were all excellent. I initially booked economy class for each flight but upgraded to first class because it was very affordable and really worth it. The flight it self was smooth.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Flew LHR-ADD-ZNZ and return (via DAR). Unable to check in online for every flight as they changed the type of plane for every sector at the last minute. Flight to ADD was fine but we sat near the back of the plane be warned that the crew use the overhead bins for storage of snacks/breakfast items. Towards the end of the flight they closed one of the 4 toilets and had to use that as storage due to the lack of space on the 757. ADD-ZNZ (via DAR) departs from T1 where there is absolutely nothing to do or see. ET do not hand out arrival cards so they have to be filled out once at the airport. By far the worst flight was ZNZ-ADD where they brought out a smaller plane (737-700 instead of 800) which meant the plane was felt extremely cramped as there was a 100% load. Finally ADD-LHR was fine apart from they insisted on serving a full meal at 03.30am and then a small muffin and juice just before landing. From what I saw 60% of the flight didn't take the main meal and slept through. In my opinion it would have been better for them to serve the muffin at 3 am and the main meal for breakfast when everyone was awake.

I took a flight from Frankfurt to Kilimanjaro Airport via Addis Ababa. Flight departed at 9.35pm and dinner was served at 00.30 am so one had to decide either to sleep and be hungry or the other way round. In Addis Ababa the connecting flight did not exist anymore and nobody knew anything about it. Half an hour before departure we were informed that we have to take the flight to Dar Es Salaam which stops at Kilimanjaro Airport. On this second flight carry-on luggage which was fine on the first flight had to be checked in.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Flew Lusaka-Addis Dubai on December 12th and return on Jan 4th. While going was expecting a Dreamliner on both sectors but was disappointed they were 77L's. Was impressed though with the 77L's new aircraft lots of leg room had PTV's but feel that there should be more variety in the in-flight entertainment. Nevertheless it is a big improvement in in-flight entertainment from their 763's/752's. Dreamliner on return leg was excellent. Staff service and meals have always been excellent. Been flying this route for about 7 years and the airline just keeps getting better and better.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Flight from London to Zanzibar with stops in Addis Ababa and Dar es Salaam. There was no inflight entertainment the ground staff were unhelpful and the air hostesses seemed to resent serving passengers. Flights were good in terms that they were smooth good landings and take offs. We had a nightmare situation when leaving Zanzibar- they told us our ticket home had been cancelled and we were unable to get on our flight home. We still have no idea as to how this happened luckily we were able to get on the next flight 12 hours later.

Frankfurt to Douala. Flight fair from Frankfurt to Addis but from Addis to Douala it became a nightmare. We made a stopover for more than 1 hour 15 mins in Malabo which was not stated in the flight itinerary. The crew were rude when I asked why they mention in the itinerary that we were going to have a stopover. The plane was over crowded people kept boarding and boarding until a few didn't have a seat. The seats were very uncomfortable with no air conditioning. I will never fly this airline again.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Bangkok via Addis Ababa to Harare and back in business class (if this can be called a business class). Out of the 4 legs 3 were flown on old aircraft's with outdated business class seats (no entertainment malfunctioning antiquated seats reasonable food and friendly service. Return flight from Harare to Addis was late whereby this seems to be a constant feature. All in all considering that the prices are low a reasonable alternative but not to be repeated too often.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
LHR-ADD-HRE and HRE-ADD-LHR. I was pleasantly surprised with the efficiency of operations of this airline. All flights left on time or within 10 minutes of it. Comfortable flights but food from ADD seems to include very spicy main meals. Other legs had very good food. One criticism - the ADD-LHR flight only leaves ADD at 01.35 and they then insist on serving dinner (at 03.00). We then got a muffin and tea before landing at LHR. It would have been better to let us go straight to sleep after take off and then give us something more substantial for breakfast. No individual IFE screen on that early morning flight but it did not bother us.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Outbound: YYZ-JNB via ADD. Inbound: JNB-YYZ via ADD and FCO. On YYZ-ADD flight the flight was operated by a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Window seat was nice. Flight delayed 45 mins. Flight attendants were great food average PTVs were average size and decent. Overall this flight arrived on-time. Addis Ababa airport was nice and clean but not much service. On ADD-JNB flight it was operating with an old Boeing 767. Cabin was dirty tray tables were broken seats were torn apart and PTVs weren't functional. Flight was delayed 30 mins. Cabin crew were nice and food was average again. Flight arrived late. On the return flight on JNB-ADD flight was operated by a Boeing 757. Cabin was fairly clean no PTVs no leg room and food was ok. Surprisingly we were only 5 mins behind schedule. Cabin crew were unresponsive and unwilling to bring extra water. At Addis Ababa airport it was the same experience I had when headed to Johannesburg. On the flight ADD-YYZ via FCO the plane was a Boeing 777. PTVs were the same as the Boeing 787 food seemed better than the YYZ-ADD flight delayed at both ADD and FCO for about 15-30min. Cabin crew was nice but seemed to be purposely ignoring the passenger next to me. Overall my experience with Ethiopian Airlines was mixed up but great. Sure hope to fly them again but not on those Boeing 757 or 767 aircraft.

Montreal to Lomé via Toronto and Addis Ababa. Besides the fact that Ethiopian Airlines flights always leave late I have nothing much to complain about. Took the B787 and the B777 for the long trips food is okay and flight attendants nice. Would be nice if people could use credit cards at restaurants at Bole airport. But that's not up to Ethiopian Airlines.

10 December MXP-ADD-JNB with 1hr stopover in Rome. Return leg on 31 December. MXP-ADD 767. Flight on- time food ok but nothing special. PTVs but didn't try them. ADD-JNB 767 similar experience but no IFE. Addis airport is ok with reasonable seating although smoking seemed to be permitted all over. Return leg JNB-ADD was 787 so different experience. Good IFE. ADD-MXP 757. Old aircraft and 1hr delay. Limited leg room. Baggage arrived ok. Generally staff were pleasant. Overall experience was good.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Various trips from KL to Niamey recently from Bamako to Addis Ababa. Flight attendants overall not very friendly and should learn to smile more. On ground staff could be more organized. ET planes are generally old making long hauls very long as inflight entertainment takes you back in time. There are not many options for airlines within/from West Africa there is definitely room for improvement for ET.

Flew 22 December from Bangkok to Addis Ababa Business class - plane 2 hours delayed. Entering the plane papers on the floor carpets torn the trays of both our seats were broken. A 10 hour flight and no onboard entertainment. The inside was dirty with marks all over and everything was rattling. The hostesses were very unprofessional. At Addis Ababa another delay of 5 hours. The credit card machines didn't work nor the ATM. Came back on 11 January. Same problems but no delay this time. Will never fly with Ethiopian again and will not recommend it to anyone.

From Johannesburg to Addis Ababa and then to Frankfurt. Delayed 3 hours then more and more. Very little information as if they were afraid to tell us. Only one bottle of water during the 6 hours wait in the terrible airport of Addis. The inflight experience was a joke. Slow if any service and simply not a nice trip when finally in the air! Dreamliner it may be but quite like a nightmare!

Flew LHR-ADD-LLW and had a generally better experience than reviews had led me to expect. Firstly cabin crew are excellent as friendly as BA on a good day although a bit less attentive. The first plane the 767 was as old as 767s tend to be. My IFE wasn't working but it was a night flight and I wasn't fussed. Plane was fine overall had the newer style overhead lockers. ADD was a bit basic. Bizarre duty free mostly very small shops. 3 flights went from the same gate but when they announced over the intercom it was impossible to hear and they seemed to send me to the wrong gate. I was the last person on the flight for the last leg! This was a 737. Brand new seats are more basic than Ryanair but otherwise it came with the interior pack and was pleasant enough for 3 hours. Would be getting tetchy after that though! Food was good throughout.

Flew a 737 from JNB to Addis - (5hrs). Not a pleasant experience given the size of the aircraft and duration of the flight. No inflight entertainment I might add. Addis to Guangzhou was a much larger aircraft - 777. IFE was poor. Food was again average.

KUL-BKK in economy because it was less than 3 hours. Plane was a 767 and showing its age somewhat. Ashtrays some of which were missing leaving gaping holes in the arm rests non-working smoking and seatbelt lights and to be fair the plane didn't smell particularly nice. One of the TV's was broken and displayed a distorted safety briefing. No headphones provided. Plane had only around 50 people on. Meal was edible and staff seemed friendly to me. Served drinks 3 times on the 2 hour flight without any prompting from myself (Beer was nearly at its expiry date). I would fly Ethiopian again at a push although only as a last minute alternative to being shoehorned into an Air Asia seat.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
At one time I was a gold member with Ethiopian Air and left due to the poor plane quality treatment of business class customers and staff. This was more before their Star Alliance designation and new fleet. Unfortunately it does not seem much has changed. On the 6 hour flight from Johannesburg to Addis the business class seats barely recline meal service takes most of the flight and there is no personal entertainment system which is standard on most economy flights let alone business. Lounge in Addis which should be their flagship is still overcrowded with slow internet and no priority boarding for business passengers. On the plane from Addis to Nairobi my original seat was taken when I boarded. I asked the flight attendant and simply redirected me to another seat even though I was originally seated next to my wife. Very little room for overhead luggage so the stewardess said she would take care of it. I asked her not to put my bags in the back and she agreed. I look behind and she is already halfway down the plane. I hope the Star Alliance designation will eventually force a higher standard. Until then Ethiopian remains a carrier of last resort.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
NBO-ADD-BKK-HKG in business class on old 767 planes. While I am fully aware that this airline has both 777 and new 787 planes these old 767s are in very poor condition. Broken seats poor leg rest (really no leg rest unless you are very short) and very worn fabric. I travel in Africa and thought that I should start using Ethiopian as a Star Alliance member but this will be my last trip unless I see that I will be on one of the newer planes. I travel over 100K miles each year and this has to rank as my poorest experience.

IAD-ADD on B777 ADD-FCO-IAD on B787 both in "Cloud Nine" (business class). Service meals and snacks excellent flights on time (despite a two - instead of a one-hour stop in FCO). The main interest in these flights was the return on a B787 "Dreamliner. The plane did not seem quieter than the B777 and it was no more comfortable. There was no window in Row 4 on other side of the business class cabin. All 30 seats IAD- ADD were occupied 22 of 24 ADD-IAD.

Flying on a 737-700 for 5 hours to SA was not a pleasant experience 118 people crammed in an air taxi does not resemble a "Spirit of Africa". The worst is however that you have a captive market as there is no other alternative to Addis Ababa - a pity.

Paris to Zanzibar with a connection in Addis Abada (Economy). Nights flights both ways. Average experience: flights on time flight attendants quite friendly and helpful lounge at T1 in Addis doesn't really deserve its name but free wifi everywhere T2 is much better but very crowded. Food onboard was average - nothing special. Equipment onboard quite old and should be renovated. Zanzibar-Addis had a stop at Dar El Salam for 1hr the temperature was like being in a sauna. TV screens and the choice of movies very poor.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
We were booked on a flight that never existed flights were up to 1.5 hours earlier than times provided by ET luggage delivered to wrong terminal but nobody would go outside to collect it because it was raining - everything was soaked through. ET and other reps could not say if planes had landed or not at T1 and was laughed at when asked for help. Flight attendants never address people out of their seats kept shaking me awake on overnight flights for food service even after I put my sleep mask on. Honestly when issues are brought to the attention of an ET rep they genuinely don't seem to care. And they really don't care about competition. I will never fly them again.

Sheba miles redemption Business Class ticket Guangzhou-Bangkok. At the airport told flight was going direct from to Addis to Guangzhou and I would have to travel 4 days later. I explained this was not acceptable - I had a connecting flight from BKK the following day and a hotel booking in BKK. After some time and genuine effort from ground staff was rebooked on China Southern flight the next morning (in business class). Agree with other comments that ET has no place in Star Alliance. Only worth considering if your plans are very flexible.

The upholstery was threadbare the console in the armrest was broken the footrest fell off when I adjusted it and the video monitor was unwatchable.

The 767's are a little old and tired but no worse than on BA. Not much recline on the seats. The staff were good and the food looked reasonable. The local flight was on a fairly modern Bombadier Q400. Both outbound and return flights were delayed.

In ADD separate van as promised took J class pax to terminal. Cloud 9 lounge is huge but stuffy and overcrowded. Worst boarding procedure I've experienced all pax at gate before time but staff created chaos. Awful old 767 to London - like stepping back into the 80s.

This past week flying Addis to Washington DC our 17 hour scheduled flight turned into a 30-hour nightmare. Communication from the cockpit was nearly non-existent. They ran out of drinks and the toilets were filthy. Our delay included 3 hours on the tarmac in Naples (with no exit) and 9 hours on the tarmac in Rome waiting for fuel. At no time during the excessive delay were we offered a chance to exit the plane. We missed our connecting flight(s) home.

Flew Business Class from Kinshasa to Addis Ababa and onto Bangkok. I have had better quality entertainment and food on Economy Flights of other airlines. The inflight entertainment was a shared TV and showed one awful movie. On my flight to Bangkok which was an 8 hour flight we had one awful meal in total and even though we arrived at 8 in the morning we got no breakfast not even a cup of tea/coffee! It's very unfortunate that I have to return back using the same airline as the ticket has already been purchased but I will never use them again.

PNR-ADD-BOM. Pointe noire to Mumbai via Addis. Wrote to reservations for a special meal request the reply was prompt and helpful. At Pointe Noire airport requested a window seat was given aisle seats on both sectors instead. Leg room from PNR-ADD was terrible. I was given a fruit meal which was nothing but an apple and a few slices of watermelon. Some of the cabin crew on this sector was polite but some of them were rude and disinterested. 45-50 mins before landing in ADD I went to ask for a glass of water. While one of the crew was about to hand over a small bottle of mineral water she was told off by a colleague and asked to give a glass of water from one of the taps. The inflight magazine was missing from the seat pocket. The flight from ADD-BOM was better. Again I got the requested fruit meal and was identical to the earlier one. This time the aircraft and legroom was much better. Each seat had an inflight magazine headphones etc. Entertainment was from overhead screens. All flights were more or less on time. I am a frequent flier on ET and their service has remained the same over the years. You can never be sure of consistency it depends on the cabin crew.

We checked in at Heathrow and had no problems check-in opened more than 3 hours early and the queue was short given 5 desks were open. We were however asked to sign a declaration that we knew we would be required to pay £10 per Kg above 7Kg of carried on baggage. Having read previous reviews of this 'scam' we were prepared and most things were sent as checked in luggage. On boarding we realised that the 7Kg limit including duty free was not a 'scam' but a bare necessity as the plane was so old it did not have the overhead locker space to deal with the modern traveller. There is no onboard entertainment. Transit in Addis was ok plane arrived on time and the connection was smooth. Overall we left on time and we arrived on time at a reasonable price.

Nairobi-Addis-Delhi. The planes are old and dirty. There was no personal inflight entertainment system on the seats and the common TV had nothing better to show but some boring documentary. Food was terrible but the cabin crew were attentive and polite. Our return flight Delhi to Nairobi was a prop aircraft very uncomfortable terrible food.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
We booked months in advance but Ethiopian cancelled that flight at the last-minute and charged an exorbitant last-minute fare to change to the next scheduled flight. They showed no interest in retrieving the luggage that they'd jettisoned nor in forwarding it to our hotel once they did arrive. Desk staff were reluctant to seat the two of us together preferring us to each sit between strangers. Ordered vegetarian meals were not provided. Avoid this outfit if possible. Cabin staff helpful and went out of their way to to provide alternative meals.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
The domestic flights departed on schedule despite rather chaotic airports and ATRs were well kept and the crew friendly. ADD- IAD flight in Business also very nice and attendants was thoughtful and efficient. The seat in B777 but has fewer position adjustment than some others and took a bit of fiddling to get right but was comfortable. The food was tasty and served real style. The lounge in ADD is far too small for the evening traffic and by about 21.30 there was standing room only. The fact that we arrived in IAD almost 2 hours late was never mentioned.

RUH-ADD-RUH and domestic sectors (Gonder Lalibela). Cabin crew not particularly attentive or helpful. Check-in fast and efficient both RUH and ADD. Chaotic boarding on ADD-RUH due to two aircraft being laid on for the same flight/dep time. Inflight ok and as expected. Airfare competitive and convenient dep times. Domestic: on time efficient clean aircraft no hassles. Fares/seats available at very short notice.

ADD-IAD-ADD and ADD-NBI. I found it an enjoyable flight full of inflight services. Crews are very co-operative and providing all the necessary support when requested. There was enough information as to the status of the flight once it took off.

An awful experience from New Delhi to Lagos. No proper arrangement for entertainment seats are small and uncomfortable. Staff did not respond to call buttons. I will not recommend this airline.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
International flight from Washington DC to Addis Ababa. Food exceeded expectations. Even in Economy class we were given 2 choices of food. The plane was delivered one month before and was brand new. The entertainment centre in front of you was touch screen and had a wide selection of popular movies music and more. A blanket was provided along with a sleeping mask amenities and a choice of magazines. Towards the middle of the flight flight attendants set up stations along the plane with different sodas and other drinks.

FRA-ADD-ZNZ. The journey started with pure typical African choas at check-in. Later at the gate I was upgraded into Business Class but onboard kicked out by cabin crew (according due to mishap by Lufthansa ground crew). Second try in Economy Class. Everyone was given headphones for the IFE until the crew realized that this aircraft IFE system was broken - they knew before as the safety demo was done already manually! After dinner-service and duty free the lights turned off - lights on shortly before for landing. After 7hrs flight no breakfast at all just a muffin and a glass of juice served. Best part the crew come around during breakfast to collect the used headphones (there was no usage!). Transit in ADD a nightmare always only 1 toilet after security per terminal not per Gate or Flight etc. Flight to ZNZ better shorter flight but much more food - problem all food from ADD was in very poor condition - like texture taste smell. I think Ethiopian Airlines is not ready yet to enter Star Alliance - and a lot of work has to be done!

EBB-ADD-BKK return in Business Class. Check-in at EBB was easy and fast however as most of the time the check-in in BKK was horrible. It took me over 1 hr 20 mins to check-in at Cloud Nine Counter as there were many non-Business Class passengers using that counter with too much luggage and many with no confirmation. Restriction on Cabin luggage should be reinforced as many have too many bags suitcases etc. Food and service in Business Class is very good but entertainment is poor old and often non functional. Also many seats need to be refit and fixed as they do not recline or leg rest broken.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
EBB-ADD-EBB. They are punctual with clean aircraft with pleasant staff. Food in Business or Economy is excellent.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I would have rated them a good airline apart from the fact they fly international routes with a propeller aircraft dash 8. I flew Addis to Mombassa route on this aircraft for 3 hrs and it was awful the seats were small hard and did not recline. I could not describe the relief when we landed such aircrafts are only for short haul domestic flights not lasting more than 30 minutes to load international passengers on a 3 hour flight on such an aircraft is to have a total lack of consideration for your passengers.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
BAH-ADD-JNB return in Economy. Bahrain to Addis good flight on time with good service new 737 (800). Some confusion when changing in Addis with tight schedule. From Addis to JNB old 757 with little room for carry on baggage causing problems for passengers arriving on the plane last. However good on time flight with decent service. Return leg delayed again due to carry on baggage not fitting onboard. The baggage problem delayed take off causing very tight connection at Addis and no transfer of hold luggage which only arrived 24 hours later at Bahrain. One criticism is that Ethiopian would not deliver the late baggage to me and I had to return to the airport to collect it causing some inconvenience.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Addis to Lebanon and the crew were awful. Considering I was flying Business class there was little to no service and definitely not worth the price paid.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Business class from Mumbai to Addis and Addis to Harare the service is good but nothing special the hostess are friendly the check-in counter staff are courteous and food was hot and tasty. Baggage was on time so no complaints. From Harare to Addis and Addis to Mumbai the check-in staff were arrogant the inflight service was bad the food was not served on time and was cold. I was served non-veg even though I had specifically requested veg and not to forget the baggage reached me after 3 days. So the good experience in Business was ruined with that of Economy.

KGL-NBO-ADD-BKK B737/B767-300. Departure from Kigali rescheduled and delayed one hour on which I was not informed despite being registered in all systems. Suddenly included a most unnecessary stop in Nairobi making a saving as they combine 2 flights to one with the discomfort of far boarding passengers. Business Lounge in Kigali a joke - given a budget by Ethiopian of 10 USD to purchase food and drinks. As food alone costs 10 USD all drinks are on one’s own. First time in life I have experienced such limit. Addis to BKK on time. Special meal ordered was not acknowledged but happened by chance to make a good match with days menu (2 options). Wines very sparse basically only 1 option of each red white and champagne which is on the lower side on business class. Lounge in Addis T2 acceptable with pro and cons. Food good plenty conservative. No cheese were offered. Entertainment provided no choice. Staff friendly willing to learn and proactive.

ADD-GDQ-ADD. Seating one class 2x2. Vegetarian sandwiches close to inedible. Decent selection of non-alcoholic drinks. Both flights on-time. Friendly attentive service given the short one-hour flight time.

IAD-ADD-IAD business class on B777. Comfortable seats angled lie-flat. Friendly attentive service. Excellent meals and snacks good selection of drinks. Non-stop IAD-ADD on the return a one hour layover at FCO. Only seven 7 out of 34 seats occupied IAD-ADD and only ten occupied ADD-IAD.

BKK-ADD-KGL B67-300 and B737. BKK departure on time. Departure from Addis 3 hours delayed due to mechanical error” (change of aircraft). New terminal 1 in Addis starts now to operate all regional flights but is far from geared to it yet. It is under construction no internet Tax Free of 12 sq m size. Airport monitors misleading as they just report everything to schedule and oppress or hide delays pretending that all departures are on time. Same route also delayed the following day by 1 hr 30 mins. Lounge in Addis acceptable with pro and cons. Onboard : a solid old fashioned business class concept like for the same airline 15 years ago. Seat very limited recline no personal IFE but does not make much difference as there is hardly any IFE anyway. Wines not up to standard and not those on printed on winecard. Food good and plenty. Choice of beers and cheese good with a variety of excellent Ethiopian products. Entertainment provided no choices. Staff friendly very neat service-minded proactive.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
DEL-PEK-DEL Business Class. Outbound check-in surprised to find that there was no dedicated check-in for business class. Boarding was swift and departure on time. Boeing 757-300 was not appropriate for 7 hour flight to Beijing. The product was outdated with old recliner style seats arranged 2x2 with decent legroom and was clean and well-mantained considering the age. IFE from mainscreen was poor and a problem on a day-time flight. Two meals were offered - hot canapes inedible and out of place even in economy class. FAs attentive and professional. A few hours later lunch was served which was much better with generous portions and good quality. Arrival in Beijing was without any hassles. Beijing-Delhi check-in was a mess in spite of a dedicated business class counter - unfriendly and inept staff. The whole process took over twenty minutes. Old Boeing 767 with the same seats but PTV's - IFE choice was limited with 3 movies running on loops. Hardly inspiring considering AVOD being a norm now even on many regional carriers. The dinner was of a high standard. The real issues came when I landed in Delhi. In spite of a new terminal Ethiopian had no clear signage as to where the bags were being delivered. Subsequently upon finding the correct conveyer belt I discovered my priority tagged luggage had not been off-loaded with the conveyer belt showing bags delivered for the flight. The same was with another passenger on the flight. Ethopian Airlines staff could not be found and when we finally found one we came across one of the most unhelpful and petulent staff I have come across. The person was firstly dismissive stating bags would come in later until we had to show him the screen on the conveyer belt. Finally he picked up his cell phone and dialled someone asking for two black bags. No attempt was made to check on the baggage ticket numbers. Finally we waited another ten minutes until he stated that it was time for him to go home and the bags would be delivered. We had to involve the customer service desk at Delhi airport who were helpful and ensured that we were attended to. Planes old punctuality good and inflight service excellent but the outdated product poor ground handling at Beijing and Delhi are major negatives.

Bahir Dar to Addis Addis to Lalibela return and Addis to London pleased with the service. They gave a lunch on domestic flights - better than in Canada. My complaint would be the lack of an individual TV screen on Addis-London flight but I rarely use the IFE.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
One of the worst long distance flight experiences I have had. IAD to Addis Ababa return with an additional 3 Ethiopian domestic leg. Not one flight left on time with absolutely no explanation from Ethiopian. Return flight from Addis to Washington DC left 3 hours late which resulted in missing my connections. I was advised that someone from Ethiopian would be available upon arrival to rebook my continuing flight. Not only was no one there it took another 3 hours to finally get some help from them and then they were so slow I missed the connection they booked me on. 4 people inside the Ethiopian office and 3 of the 4 doing nothing except talking on their personal cell phones. Inflight experience wasn't much better. My TV monitor had no sound the monitor in the empty seat next to me didn't work at all and I left my flight attendant light on for 4 hours and not one attendant ever responded to it. The only positive comment I have is their 777 coach class was comfortable.

LLW to TLV via Addis. LLW to Addis in 737-700 bit delayed but flight was positive. Business Class seats in 737 superior to those in South African Airways and lack of entertainment. Food was good. ADD-TLV in B757 business seat was old style food good and staff cordial and attentive. Surprised how Addis airport remains a smoking facility. Airport very basic.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
I will never travel Ethiopian Airlines again. After a technical fault with the plane on our return journey home the plane was delayed and we missed all our connecting flights. The Cabin crew were rude check in staff made numerous mistakes on our boarding passes including wrong time for boarding. They just repeated the programme on the onboard video as it was a long flight.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Business class Lusaka to Addis. Old Boeing 767 with 25 year old business class layout - very old and very tired but a lot better than steerage and price not bad. Jet needs to be put out to pasture - the shake on takeoff unbelievable even for a B767.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Johannesburg to Bangkok return with a stopover. Was the worst flight experience I've ever had. Out of the 4 flights not a single one left on time. Staff were generally unfriendly and unhelpful. Addis airport is about as basic as they come. The inflight experience was dismal. Cant remember the movie played but I do remember the picture quality is awful and the audio is out of sync. On my return trip I was delayed by over 24 hours and we were booked into a hotel for the night. The hotel was the only good part of the experience. For the delay we were given a 300 dollar flight voucher which I will not use regardless how cheap the flight is. Terrible airline.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Flew to Johannesburg from London via Ethiopia return. Quite impressed by the hostess hospitality. Food good journey was smooth. The downer is no individual Inflight Entertainment. For the price it is a pleasant airline and I wouldn't mind using it again. When I got to Heathrow I couldn't find my luggage but within 2 days it was delivered to my house intact.

BOM-ADD-LLW return except on return leg had a 2 day stopover in ADD. On the outward journey BOM-ADD flight was delayed so I almost missed my next connection. Flight left at 6.30 am (1.30 hr delay) so had no sleep so can't comment about food entertainment as I was so tired that I woke up directly in ADD upon touchdown. ADD-LLW-ADD which was supposed to be direct both the times we halted in Lubumbashi Congo DR! Due to this both times we arrived later than scheduled. LLW-ADD flight left 1hr before scheduled departure time! Getting visa on arrival at ADD was a joke and after that there was a long queue for customs clearance. It took 1.15 hr mins to get out! But staff courteous and food was not bad. Was so fed up that I paid and upgraded to Business for last leg (ADD-BOM). Old 757 Economy looked terrible Business food and service was good.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
DAR-ADD-LHR Business return in Economy - this will be the last time I use the carrier. A 13 hour delay in Addis (cargo door couldn't be closed) - was not their fault - not giving us any information (captain came on over 2 hours later whilst we were sitting on the runway to say he thought we were all asleep and didn't want to wake us up!) certainly is their fault. Handled very badly. Return legs economy - ground staff at Heathrow are a complete joke.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
This has to be the worst airline I have ever flown. From late departures to no luggage at destination to late arrival missing connecting flights and spending the night on a bench (No accommodation at midnight) in Beijing. Just a mess from start to finish. The toilets were nothing but disgusting. On return to JNB our luggage was left in Addis with not a sole from the airline to give an explanation. Not the aircraft we were supposed to use but a 737 which I don't think can carry full pax and luggage and be able to carry the fuel on the leg Addis to JNB - so leave the luggage behind. The irate passengers was something to behold. Never again I say.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
ADD to JNB today. Staff at check in were friendly. Flight was good (service food on time etc) but what a shock when we arrived in Johannesburg and were told that none of the passengers luggage had been loaded. Only the crews luggage and that of passengers who had hand luggage that was too big to be accommodated was on the carousel. We were given no explanation as to why our luggage had not been loaded. It is interesting that the crew were not inconvenienced - only the paying passengers! This is not a way to treat customers - there may have been good reasons for why the plane flew without our luggage but it would have been good manners for the Captain to have informed us of the situations during the flight (or on landing): the reasons for the decision to fly without our luggage and what steps would be taken to remedy the situation.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
HKG-Addis return business class with stops in Bangkok in both directions. Ancient B767s but old style business class seat surprisingly comfortable and was able to sleep. IFE pretty much non-existent. HKG-Addis had personal screens in business class which did not work so movies played on large screen at front of cabin. On return flight no pretence of personal screens or IFE of any kind and no films shown anywhere on the aircraft. Service friendly responsive and unobtrusive and superior to North American airlines. On return leg I was the sole business class passenger on Bangkok-HKG sector and my priority bags were the very last to arrive at the carousel. Price is good but I would only use this airline again if traveling to Addis from Asia as the schedule is very convenient.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
London Heathrow to Lusaka via Addis and Harare and back from Lusaka to London. Return journey very good particularly Lusaka-Addis leg where the plane was half empty. Staff were helpful and friendly. Trip out from London not so good took off about 9.30 but didn't get meal until 12.30 then took another hour to clear away before switching down cabin lights for sleep. But after reading the reviews it was better than I expected.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
IAD to LUS via ADD in economy class return with a side trip to ZNZ. Inflight entertainment system worked only 20% of the time. Flights were all late by at least an hour with no explanation. Flight attendants were rude. The air conditioning broke while we waited for over an hour in 35 degree heat on the runway in ZNZ. Overall a very poor experience.

### Ethiopian Airlines customer review
Ethiopian Airlines was the worst travel experience I have ever had. Dubai-Johannesburg and back via Addis Ababa for the World Cup. The outbound flight was late missed our connection so had to stay overnight in Addis. Missed the first day of World Cup opening ceremony and game. On the way home no luggage when we arrived in Dubai. Two pieces turned up after a few days one was declared lost after 40 days. The customer service is terrible the flights are always late and the Business Class we travelled was the worst business class I have ever flown with.
