### "unprofessional and totally clueless"
Purchased ticket direct from Asky Airlines for flights from Abidjan to Nairobi with transfer in Lome. When arrived in Lome we were told the second leg to Nairobi was cancelled, no explanation given. Later staff told us we were being sent back to Abidjan and from there would take a direct flight to Nairobi with Kenyan Airlines. However Asky ground staff didn't have boarding passes or documents for the flight to Nairobi and told us to get our boarding passes at the Keyna Airlines desk in Abidjan. When we asked how to do this when the desk was airside and most people didnt have visas to enter into Ivory Coast. The Asky staff looked dumbfounded. Then they said someone from Asky would meet us in Abidjan and get us through the transfer area. Of course there wasn't anybody there and we (about 20 people in all) spent over an hour arguing with Abidjan airport ground staff and trying to convince them we had tickets to Nairobi. Eventually we got new boarding passes printed and let transfer. Nobody from Asky staff ever turned up. During the whole time in Lome Asky staff kept passing the issues from one staff member to the other, very unprofessional and totally clueless. We arrived in Nairobi 12 hours later. Didn't receive any compensation, not even a food voucher.

### "ASKY should do better"
My trip wasn’t planned, it was a last minute thing, had to find a flight going to Bangui in 2 days, only flight available was ASKY, 5 years ago had a horrible experience with ASKY but had no choice but to fly them. Going to Bangui flight was good, flight attendants were great, joyful, easy to talk to, good manners and helpful, I was shocked and surprised but in a good way. Bangui to Lome flight, KP 035 was terrible, same bad experience all back, flight attendants super nasty, bad attitude, bad service, impolite, miserable people. They need to go back to learn how to react with customers! Don’t bring your bad mood to your job! People on the plane are paying customers, they deserve respect. ASKY should do better!

### "canceled our flights"
Both Ethiopian Airlines and Asky Airlines have failed to deliver the services that I paid for. Asky Airlines canceled our flights as we stood at the airport without a single announcement being made. We did not receive an explanation as to why the flight was cancelled and we're provided different explanations from every single person that we spoke with from the airline. I emailed Asky regarding the cause of the cancellation and have yet to receive a response from anyone. Since I had booked my flight directly through Ethiopian Airlines, I called their customer support and somehow the Ethiopian Airlines rep was also unable to get any feedback from Asky Airlines. How is it possible for Ethiopian Airlines to be a strategic partner to Asky Airlines and not know when there's disruptions with their connecting flights or be able to communicate adequately between the two airlines. Even worst, when Asky Airlines tried to reschedule us for the next flight, they went through the entire process of rebooking and generating boarding passes only to come back and tell my wife and I that the plane was full for our rescheduled flights. So after several hours of waiting in Accra Airport we were forced to stay an extra day for the next available flight back to the US. It gets even worst, because the final destination for our new flight is in a different location in the US since the airline doesn't seem to be able to find any other flight options. So now not only do I have the cost of losing a day of travel, but I also have the cost of having to book another flight from the new destination in order to get home. This is absurd! When my wife and I booked with Ethiopian and Asky Airlines, we thought we would give them a chance to prove themselves despite all of the negative reviews that we had read online. We have learned our lesson and will never fly with either of these airlines again.

### "the worst airline ever"
My flight got canceled without any notice and they did not care at all or even apologize. They changed my itinerary and refused to pick up my call on their so call called WhatsApp call Center. This is the worst airline ever, please do not fly with them ever! They have no respect for their clients

### "Their service is outrageous"
Not Verified |  Flight was supposed to depart around 10:45 morning apparently the crew was not available and it got delayed by 2hrs. Once the crew arrived they started boarding the flight and after few mins of boarding completion the flight was about to take off they once again returned back. The captain kept us waiting and after 1hr, captain announced everyone must disembark the flight. So during this process nor the captain or Asky management team didn't even turn back to apologise the passenger and no information about alternate arrangement. Their service is outrageous.

### ASKY Airlines customer review
Not Verified |  This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I made a transit from Lome to Accra. Dirty, old plane. I was afraid to touch anything onboard. Got to Accra and all 3 of my luggages were missing. 2 came two days later and now with over a week of going to the airport everyday to check, my last luggage is still missing. The company doesn't have anything on their site to report this. The airline service desk at the airport was no help at all. Still haven't heard from them.

### "food served was utterly inedible"
Check in with rude staff. Boarding chaotic. On board the food served was utterly inedible - stale bread. Inadequate drink selection. Dirty aircraft, despite it not being that old. Rude cabin staff. Uncomfortable business class seat. Only positive was good ground handling of business class passengers on arrival in Lome.

### "Very Terrible Experience"
Not Verified | Very Terrible Experience. I flew with Business Class but yet my luggage did not arrive. Have tried to call the ASKY office but cannot get information. No official communication has been made as to when we will get our luggage. Will never consider flying ASKY again if had an alternative.

### "my bag was damaged"
Not Verified |  I flew to Lome from Johannesburg. When l got my bag at arrival in Lome, the luggage wrapping was removed and my bag was damaged. I reported to Asky offices and they requested that I give them my empty luggage for investigating, which I did. They promised to give my feedback before I return as I was in Lome for a week. They never called back. I had to buy another suitcase. I have sent numbers of mails still no response except to acknowledge my query. The staff on board was rude to me, ne got so upset with me for asking her to give me a 2nd cup of tea.

### "no luggage was found "
Very disappointing, they are not reliable enough when it comes to luggage management. When checking it from Libreville to Johannesburg i had to take a connection flight from Lome, same airline but they couldn't check the luggage to Johannesburg. I have been instructed to collect the luggage from Lome and check in again to Johannesburg. When arrive in Lome access was dined by immigration visa was required. I reported to the Asky agent in Lome and advised all in order my luggage was sent Johannesburg. Then when I arrived in Johannesburg no luggage was found and was lost in Lome. I had to book a hotel for the weekend as i couldn't do my job without the luggage. I was very unhappy the way Asky handled this issue as i emphasized my luggage was a priority

### ASKY Airlines customer review
Not Verified |  We left Johannesburg for Lagos on the 22nd of December 2019 and the flight supposed to leave at 3.30am and we ended up leaving 6am, which was not a problem to many of us, but the problem is getting to our destination. All our bags that was wrapped was unwrap and almost everyone in the flight was complained of same thing. My bags and my friend bags was damaged and took a lot of things inside them.

### "issue with my hand luggage"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Lagos. I flew with Virgin from Sydney to Perth, then South African Airlines to Johannesburg, was there a few days and finally Asky to Lagos. I had been coming with the same baggage from Sydney. ASKY had an issue with my hand luggage stating its too big and there was no space for it on board. I agreed to check it in with my other luggage only to get to Lagos and not find my luggage. The only response I got from their customer service was that, “its a daily flight, we will bring it tomorrow”. No apology. Meanwhile I don’t live in Lagos, So I had spend extra time and money plus stress to sort out accommodation for that night.

### "lost baggage since July 31"
Lome to Accra. Reported lost baggage since July 31. No response till now. Several reminders have not proven any result. Connected with Asky Airlines thru United Airlines at Boston and Ethiopian Airlines at Newark, USA b4 taking Askty at Lome,Togo. This is bad customer service. I won't recommend this airline to anybody.

### "lack of respect of the traveler"
Kinshasa to Lome via Abidjan / Niamey. I wrote what's below while I was still in the aircraft, and I waited until know to see if I wrote it out of anger and if I would want to change it but I don't want to change anything. I would add more but I think will drive my point across. The minimum for an airline to do, is to inform them of delays when they occur. In Niamey, December 18, 2018, a group of customers including myself spent more than 6 hours at the airport not knowing if the flight that was originally scheduled at 8:45 am, and then at 11:45 am has been postponed or not. It is at the last minute, when about to board, that we learn that we do not have seats. The airplane is full capacity. Only some, 4 to 5 people, were still able to take off that day. The representatives on site have not offered passengers explanations or even a bottle of water. The next day again convened at 6:00 am, but with an explained delay, we took off around 10:00 am. Again ASKY through its representatives did not have the decency to inform passengers that there was a delay. In Lome, in transit, the flight is late again. There was no announcement, and I went to the counter, staff told me that there is a delay, obviously, and that she does not know anything else and that I only have to wait. I was furious against myself having thought that by taking Asky I would participate and support Pan-Africanism and its company. It may be an insignificant number but I and those with whom I have lived this adventure will think several times before taking Asky again; not because of the delay, it happens, but the lack of respect of the traveler.

### "staff competent"
Airport was clean, staff competent, was moved through quickly. Asky Airport office I found most helpful - my flight was changed without any hassles. The flight was 25 mins, staff competent, good take off and landing. I would definitely fly this route with them again.

### "the worst experience"
While in transit from Lome to Abuja on the 10th September, we boarded the flight as one of the last passengers and traveling as a family we got a bad vibe from a particular staff on the flight, that same staff and another staff due to the staff them not focusing on the job at hand she accused us of stealing a mug from the airline and she started causing drama saying all sorts of things in French which we could not understand - we asked her to verify but she would not and just went on talking trash. This is the worst experience I have ever had while traveling and after my return I hope to never fly with Asky again unless an action is taken towards the behavior of their staff.

### "not transparent and trustworthy"
Not Verified |  Lagos to Accra. This is by far the worst airline I’ve seen in my life. I booked a direct flight from Lagos to Accra round trip and we were delayed for 4 without any feedback, they later told us we can’t fly that day due to technical difficulties so they stuck us in an hotel and promise us that we will fly the next morning by 12 noon. The got to the airport and they delayed us till 2:30pm, we were told later that the flight available is to Lomé (Togo) and we should bear with them. We reluctantly agreed and when we landed in Lomé they fixed us in another flight to Abidjan (cote de ivoire). We flew for about 1hr 5min and waited in the plane for 30 minutes before heading to Accra. We got to Accra by 8pm and mind you a flight from Lagos to Accra is just 1hr 5mins. I strongly advise anyone not to use this airline, they are not transparent and trustworthy.

### "it was nothing but a nightmare"
Lome to Lagos. Horrible, it was nothing but a nightmare, and detestable experience. I regret ever buying that ticket and felt I just wasted my money and time. I got to Lagos on Dec 17th with only my hand luggage. I was told my two luggages did not make it to Lagos. They were left at Lome with others because our connecting flight the ASKY airplane is small and cannot carry too much load. They will be flown to Lagos at no particular date. So, I was asked to check with them every day. Meanwhile, I had no clothes, footwear and every item I was to use for my daughter's wedding on December 22nd was in those two suit cases. I checked on the airline for three consecutive days and could not go home with my luggage. I ended up repurchasing clothes for my entire stay and for my daughter's wedding. I was only able to collect my luggages on January 2nd more than two weeks after I arrived Lagos, and the next day boarded the useless plane back to Lome before connecting Ethiopian Airlines back to Newark. Meanwhile, I had excess luggage as a result of all the new clothes I bought for my stay, since the one I brought was left at Lome. I pleaded for mercy so I will not be charged excess luggage fee but all fell on deaf ears. I gave them my debit card to pay for the excess luggage, but was told their POS machine wasn't working and as such I have to pay cash. Meanwhile I had no cash on me, the representative flatly told me there's nothing he can do. Either I pay cash or I will miss the flight. I sought for the manager, he gave me the worst response any traveler would want to hear. He blamed his inefficiency on Ethiopian Airline another connecting flight. They closed their counter, leaving me running around for cash. When eventually I brought the cash, I was told it was too late. I did not receive any apology for my luggages that I got 2 weeks after my arrival which was the reason for my excess luggage. My case was not an isolated one. It was the same for thousands of travelers who used their services last December. All they do is ruin their customers vacation and make them cry for the airlines mistake. Stay away from them if service, efficiency and respect and dignity matter to you.

### "never fly the airline again"
Lome to Conakry with ASKY Airlines. Well let's start out on the first part of the trip, showed up to the airport at 4 am to get told my flight is delayed until 9 am. The delay was because Bakmao airport was under construction which when we arrived, nothing was under construction. Having this delayed made me miss my flight from Lome to the USA. Now returning back to Conakry, Arriving in Lome we got off the airlines looking for a representative for the airlines to have to wait in line for an hour (only 8 people) to get told my luggage may or may not be on the flight. So I took it upon myself to go get my luggage and recheck it. After getting to my gate, the flight was delayed an hour an half without any word from the representatives explaining why. Only thing they would say is wait here and sit. After finally boarding it was again delayed another 30 minutes. After arriving in Bamako, I watched my luggage exit the plane, I let the flight workers know and they said they would check on it. After sitting at the airport for 30 minutes they told me it was taken care of. After arriving to Conakry I was told my luggage was left in Bakamo along with 10 other passengers and will receive it in two days. This airline has been nothing but a disappointment and I will never fly the airline again and will not recommend it.

### ASKY Airlines customer review
Not very good. The flight from Accra to Lome was late. My flight from Lome to Adoula was cancelled. Very poor information from airline management at Lome. No information as to when our flight from Lome to Aduola would be going ahead. In the end we were woken up at 3am in our hotel and told to check out at 4am. Unfortunately the airport at Lome didn't open till 5am so I and everybody else sat around until then. Still when the flight took off we got to Adoula in reasonable time. There seems to be some issues with management control/ passenger information that seriously need addressing.

### ASKY Airlines customer review
Travelled on ASKY from Douala-Bangui. I asked to see my bag prior to it being loaded to verify it was actually there. I was able to see my bag however when I arrived in Bangui I found out it was not loaded along with other passengers baggage. I was told this was because the flight was too full and the baggage was offloaded due to weight. Despite numerous phone calls and emails I still not have received my bag. ASKY agents have shown no interest whatsoever I arrived in Bangui with no other clothing. The flight was booked through Ethiopian Airlines as they claim to be "partners" Ethiopian said they cannot help once ASKY receive the bag. I would not recommend this airline to anyone they are arrogant and have no customer service at all!

### ASKY Airlines customer review
Douala to Accra via Lome. No real problems at check in just had to pay a little for excess baggage which was mercifully cheap. The only problem was finding the departure gate which was right at the end of the right arm. It looked closed until you navigated round a few doors. The flight left a little early. The aircraft for this leg into Lome was a new Q400. Basic snack was provided on what was a short flight. Lome was chaos - the airport is just not big enough to act as any sort of hub as it does for ASKY. So I only just made the connecting flight after all the queues. This time a new 737 for the 20 minute hop down to Accra. Again no problems with this leg. Overall a pretty good experience - they just need to sort out Lome. There is some construction work going on nearby so maybe that will be resolved.

### ASKY Airlines customer review
I travelled Ghana to Freetown on ASKY. There were delays leaving Accra- but in Africa this is usually expected. On my return trip- from Freetown to Accra I arrived at the airport almost 3 hours early to find out - from the security guard - that the flight did not come in the night before so the flight was cancelled. No ASKY agent was there at that time so I waited more people showed up for the flight and they actually called their travel agent who called ASKY and said the flight was cancelled. They just booked on another airline and left. I purchased my ticket through Ethiopian Air and did not have any contact details (there are no phone numbers on the web site or anything). So I waited at the airport for an ASKY rep to tell me what to do and when the next flight would be. I waited until after my flight should have departed. Having no money and the hotels not taking credit cards I could not stay overnight to try the next day. Plus I missed my connection in Accra. So I had to purchase a British air flight to get home. Paying for a new ticket and forfeiting both my return ASKY flight as well as my flight home to Canada from Ghana. Once home I had my colleagues in get me contact info for ASKY. I emailed them and followed up with a phone call - I was told to contact my travel agent. I called Ethiopia air- and they said they have nothing to do with it. I have emailed ASKY numerous times no response. I highly recommend no one use this airline.

### ASKY Airlines customer review
A great little airline launched recently in Togo with the backing of Ethiopian Airlines. The return journey from Banjul to Freetown was made as straightforward as possible by Asky who laid on the connecting bus and fast ferry as part of the ticket costs from the strangely located Lungi Airport on one side of the wide river estuary to Freetown on the other. Not all the airlines flying into Freetown do this so full marks to Asky. The flights were really smooth in good aircraft with courteous and helpful cabin crew. A very welcome discovery and an airline that I'm busily recommending now to friends and colleagues in Banjul & Freetown.
