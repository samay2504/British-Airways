KBP-OTP. Sandwiches and drinks served (even a local wine) although the flight is just over 1 hour departure/landing on time check in chaotic in Kiev; Embraer 145 looked in good condition but seats are pretty cramped. If you have medium/large size handbag they will ask to load it in the plane as the overhead compartments are small they will give you back to you in the tarmac so no need to wait at the luggage belt crew was young but not that smiley. Good experience overall.

Kiev to Odessa but they serve sandwiches and the whole range of beverages. B737 clean. Plenty of legroom. Flight was on-time. It's worth the money!

Odessa to Kiev return. Plane a rather old Boeing 737 but for such short trips (under 1 hour) is not a problem. I was surprised to see that they offered sandwiches on both flights together with tea coffee and juices.

I was recently on a short hop from Sevastopol to Kiev. Airport check-in was fast and polite. Plane was pretty old Embraer with tight legroom. Catering consisted of tea coffee water all looked and smelled uninspiring. The crew was young and nice. Ticket price was a good deal. Flight was on time. Ok for 50 min flight.

KIV-KBP-ODS. Both flights were codeshared with Aerosvit but operated by Dniproavia planes. KIV-KBP Embraer 145 that has seen better days. KBP-ODS plane was an old-looking Boeing 737-500. Service onboard was good. Offered drinks and a double sandwich despite both flights being under 1hr. Flights departed on time. They almost lost my luggage on the first flight as it was sent to connecting flights but were able to locate it relatively quickly and hand it back. Overall a relatively good experience for the price paid.

Kiev-Simferopol-Kiev-Lviv. The first two legs operated by B737 were pleasant apart from the seats being a little cramped. Snacks served staff were efficient and flights operated on time. Note that Dniproavia does not check luggage through on connecting flights or issue onward boarding passes. You must collect your baggage at Kiev and check in again. The final leg to Lviv was operated by Wind Rose (MD82). A snack with wine was served. Again the seating was a bit cramped but no complaints on this short flight.

Morning flight Kiev - Odessa a new clean Embraer 145. It was a very pleasant flight with free candies and beverages served by smiling crew. Departed on time and arrived early. Check- in in Kiev quick and easy. The atmosphere and attitude quite relaxed and pleasant.
