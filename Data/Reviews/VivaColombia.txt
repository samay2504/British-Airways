### "not able to get on the flight"
This is by far the worst airline I’ve ever experienced. My husband pre-paid for my family’s seats (4 of us all together) and checked us in the night before. When we got to the airport, we were not able to board our flight! Our seats were given away! The staff were of no help they only told us wait. We were not able to get on the flight. When we asked for a refund, they also denied this. We were told the next flight is a 4 am! Absolutely horrible customer service. Not one employee helped or showed any remorse for what they did. Additionally, my luggage was damaged by them. When I asked to file a claim, every single employee gave me the run around. What’s worse they were clearly targeting foreigners. Only foreigners were denied boarding. The other customers affected were a European couple and Mexican family.

### "find a way to charge you for anything"
This is a low cost airline so they made money and find a way to charge you for anything. I guess this is expected even with certain questionable practices, but my 1 star is regarding customer service which it may sound dystopian even compared with certain US carriers, My family god covid 19 and we were not able to travel. They suggested family members with no symptoms should be able to flight. They does not trust you as passengers, they asked for things like: birth certificate in order to proof 1st degree blood relationship of passenger without symptoms and asked for proof of residency when I requested full refund because vouchers are completely useless for me. Only way to communicate is email, each email is a new inquiry and takes 15 days to get a response. If you don't get a response you have to send another email asking for the response of the previous inquiry and this add another 15 days. One simple request is taking almost months and counting. Call center is useless, they say they are not part of "cuentanos" and you have to reach by email. If you ask to speak with a supervisor you will get denied (this is basic customer service) So avoid this airline unless you want to spend months sending emails to interact with costumer service and waiting with incomplete responses; or if you believe you should travel by plane with covid symptoms.

### "they will check everyone's bags"
Not Verified |  This airline deserves zero stars. The staff is unaccommodating and they will check everyone's bags to make sure they are to the size of there requirements and will make sure to charge you extra at every chance.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Not Verified |  I hate to pile it on but this is the worst airline I have ever flown on. It appears cheap doing a search but you’ll end up paying more with all the fees and it’s not worth it. Avoid this airline at all costs!

### "Total rip off"
Medellin to Bogota. Total rip off! Do not fly Viva Colombia. Pay the extra money and go with a better airline. I had a 1-hour flight and they made me check in my carry-on after paying twice! My luggage never made it on the carousel but had apparently made it to the destination city. I’ve filed paper work and all they did was tell me to wait. They won’t even discuss reimbursement of anything after “investigating” for days on end. Avoid at all costs!

### "Lots of hidden extra charges"
Cartagena to Medellin. Lots of hidden extra charges at the counter totalling 270,000.00. No indication that boarding passes need to be printed 2 hours before the flight so we were charged 65000 each for this privilege. Avoid avoid avoid!

### "canceled the flight"
Miami to Medellin. I purchased a ticket from Viva Colombia while waiting to board they canceled the flight after having everyone waiting more then 2 hours without any explanation. I tried to get a refund at desk but was told they will automatically refund it to Credit card . I’ve written them countless times and if/when they respond they keep asking for the same info giving the run around. It’s frustrating since I’ve been waiting since 1/18 and still nothing .

### "I had not selected baggage"
Not Verified |  Santa Marta to Bogota. Shocking airline, misleading. Spent 2 hours on the phone to change a reservation then at the end the lady said it was not possible. When I logged in to select baggage purchase what I didn't realize is they automatically select all the extra services so when I clicked on the baggage I was actually un-clicking it. The result was I paid 150K pesos for a bunch of charges and then when I arrived at the gate they told me I had not selected baggage and they charged me 200K pesos for 2 bags at the gate. I fly budget airlines in the USA and Europe and they play fair.

### "exceptional for what you pay"
Cartagena to Cali. Paid the ticket 69000 pesos, equivalent to mBP15 or EUR16. We left on time, we arrived before the scheduled time. Some people judge an airline when they spend peanuts for it. I find Vivacolombia exceptional for what you pay.

### "unexpected extra costs"
Santa Marta to Bogota. Terrible experience, never again! Staff is absolutely not helpful and at the counter they charge you unexpected extra costs. At last the flight is more expensive than with a reliable airline. Avoid Viva!

### "service is just the worst"
Medellín to Cartagena. This company customer service is just the worst, you think you are buying a cheap ticket and at the end you pay more than flying with other companies. They charge for doing check in at the counter, cabin baggage will be good for any other company except for VivaColombia cause they found a way to get more money from you and send it as regular. Also pay for pay for two seats together they just book you separate and no way to change it unless you pay more.

### "better to fly with Avianca"
Not Verified | Santa Marta to Bogota. Really do not fly with this airline, as a regular flyer I can tell you they are so bad and rude from ground staff to cabin, and as others have said charge for everything as extras even tried to charge for my partners hand bag. I end up paying extra to sit with my partner as the computer put us in different seats and told if we changed on the plane we would be charged. As it was, once on the plane everyone moved around to different seats without paying, if you work out the extras its better to fly with Avianca.

### "some staff are looking for a bonus"
Medellin to Cartegena. We paid for 20kg check in and sports equipment up to 32kgs. First he proceeded to try and charge us for 5 kg extra on check bag which was 19.8kg. Then when we refused to pay him he then went on to try and charge extra kilos on my surfboard which was 18kg and you are allowed 32. When we proved him wrong again he the proceeded to say my carry on bag was too big and it fitted in the template perfect and 2 kgs under the weight limit. I was forced to pay 71000 pesos as our flights was leaving which I’m sure he put in his pocket. There were local Colombian people putting their bags in the template and the luggage was spilling over the top and he would let them straight through. We have come all the way over from Australia spending our hard earned money in this beautiful country but for some reason people want to take advantage of this. We took the same luggage from Bogotá to Medellin with viva and it was fine so clearly some staff are looking for a bonus. Biggest grubs I've ever dealt with.

### "charge you more for everything"
Santa Marta to Bogota. VivaColombia try to charge you more money for everything that is possible. For example, if don't print your ticket they will charge you for it. If you don't have to fly with them, stay away!

### "disappointed with this airline"
Santa Marta to Medellin. Print your boarding pass before taking this airline, they charge you $10 (33,000) to print it, which we found it ridiculous. Make sure to buy bags ahead of time. I’m disappointed with this airline. The ladies at the desk looked angry and they were not helpful at all. No se olviden de imprimir su tarjeta de abordaje, porque si no les van a cobrar $10 Dolares que son 33,000 colombianos. Esta aerolinea te quiere cobrar por todo, hasta del aire que respiras. No recomiendo esta aerolinea.

### "never use this company again"
Medellín to Lima via Bogota. This company needs to be put out of business. This company's business model is completely based on theft and extortion. I arrived with a bag that fit the description of the limits on my  ticket (purchased from Kiwi). Since I could not print out my tickets, the night before I reserved them online (for what was supposed to be less of a charge). Not only did they make me pay twice to print out my tickets, once online and once in person at the MDE airport, they even acknowledged the fact that I even booked this service the day before, but that I would still have to pay an additional fine. And, that they would only print out one ticket and that I would have to pay again to get on my connecting flight in Bogota But it gets much worse than this. Even though I made sure that my big fit the size and weight limits put on my ticket, the dimension and weight requirements were different at the door. They did not express empathy or understanding of this fact, and simply made me pay the fine of $75 USD (more than the ticket price) just to bring a normal backpack designed to fit as a carry-on on board. Since I had no choice but to comply, I paid the $75, was given a receipt, and was assured that my connecting flight would accept the receipt as payment for my luggage. However, once I went in line to get my ticket for my connecting flight at the next airport, they informed me that I would not only have to pay the printing fee again, but that I would also have to pay a heftier $125 fine to bring my carry-on backpack to Lima. This price is absolutely unheard of. I have flown on AirAsia, RyanAir, and the fees that VivaColombia charged me were nothing short of robbery. In other words, the company lied to me, told me that I would only have to pay one fee, forced to pay double fines for printing tickets, and refused to accept the size and weight requirements listed on the ticket I purchased. This company is an absolute embarrassment to the people of Colombia, the airline industry, and is a model of what a terrible company looks like who values money more than the customer. . Personally, until this change is noticeable, I will never use this company again.

### "I've never been so miserable"
Do yourselves a favor and don't fly with them. VivaColombia try their hardest to charge passengers for everything. On my way from Bogota to Medellin, they charged me $12 CAD to print my boarding pass. On the way back from Medellin to Bogota, they refused to allow me to carry on the same luggage I flew into Medellin with, and insisted on charging me $40 CAD to bring my luggage on board. They were more than happy to have me miss my flight, until I had paid their ransom. The legroom on this flight was absolutely non existent (see photo). This has been the worst airline I have ever flown with (and I've flown Ryanair). If you're looking to save money by flying with this airline, I would suggest that you book somewhere else, because at the end of the day, you'll still end up paying the same amount. I will never fly with this airline again. I'm currently sitting on the flight, and I've never been so miserable.

### "treated like cattle"
Not Verified |  San Andres to Cartagena. Budget airline at the very worse end of spectrum. Passengers are treated like cattle and nuisance. Especially if you don’t speak Spanish. Beware the tricks of this airline 1. Charge you 66,0000 COP/ per person unless you have paper boarding pass 2. Charge you 10,000 COP /Kg after 15 Kg hold luggage 3. Charge you 200,000 COP for hand luggage anything larger than smallest hand luggage. Seems to be at the whim of gate staff. Medium Rucksacks (always OK with other airlines) was charge to take as hand luggage as above 4. Rude staff. Avoid if you can. Traveled with Avianca, Latam, Easyfly and Chalk and cheese differences between these airline and VivaColombia. Your flight probably will work out cheaper with other airlines.

### "This is the worst airline"
Medellin to Lima via Bogota. This is the worst airline I have ever booked with! We arrived at the check in counter 2 hours prior to departure in Medellin and were informed that there was a flight delay from Medellin therefore we would likely miss our connection from Bogota to Lima (also with Viva Colombia). The attendant gave us 2 options: a refund, or to take the same flight the next day. Taking the flight the next day was not an option as we had another connection from Lima. We decided to book an Avianca flight to get to Bogota on our own, in time for our connection. We asked the attendant to check us in to the second lag of our flight and he said he was unable to do so. Online check in was not working. We arrived at the Bogota check in counter 55 minutes prior to departure and were told it was too late to check in. Viva Colombia’s terrible customer service ended up costing me an additional $1000 in flights. Pay a little extra and fly with a different airline, you will end up saving money in the end.

### "Would never recommend"
Medellin to Bogotá. Long story short, they make you pay for carry on luggage, the same luggage that I have traveled all over south east Asia and South America, never having to pay to put it in the overhead bin. $24 bucks for carry on, just $6 less than I actually paid for the flight. Super deceptive and poor policy in my mind. Would never recommend to anyone!

### "tripod can't travel in cabin"
Medellin to Cartagena. I bought the ticket online with an extra luggage. When I arrived at the check in they told me that my tripod can't travel in the cabin with me. So I had to pay extra for the tripod. Besides that since I didn't print the ticket they charge me more than 70.000 pesos. In total they got extra 111.000 pesos.

### "make us buy the seats"
Bogotá to Lima. This company sees profit and nothing more. In a very empty aircraft they put people in distant rows in order to make us buy the seats next time. And worst they say you can't change seats unless you pay a ridiculous fee. I understand they put family in different rows of aircraft is full but our was half full and even with an empty row by my side, my wife stayed ten rows back.

### "Staff are rude and unhelpful"
Lima to Bogotá. This might be the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. They scam their customers to get money out of them. I was charged $44 for my boarding pass. They also don’t accept this payment via credit card, debit card or the local currency so you risk missing your flight while you run around an airport trying to track down the cash. At which point, of course, you can add on various fees by ATMs and money changers. I ended up paying about £50 for Viva to print two bits of paper. Staff are all rude and unhelpful; they actually laughed at our misfortune. They seem incapable of having a flight leave on time and aircraft service is non-existent. There are plenty of other low-cost carriers in South America whose business model does not involve fleecing their clients, and a strongly recommend you book with them.

### "told me the gate is closed"
I booked a flight from Lima to Bogota for about USD 200 (including all insurances, baggage and some other fees). Web-check-in wasn't working so I had no printed boarding pass. At the check-in counter they charge USD 22 to print this piece of paper (sustainability). Unbelievable! After 10 minutes at the check-in counter they told me that the gate is closed now (50 minutes before departure!) and that I have to contact the call center. At least we were about 10 people who couldn't get in and we think that the flight was already overbooked. In the end I booked a new flight with Avianca for USD 400. Never again with VivaColombia.

### "never fly with them again"
Medellin to Cartagena. Just terrible! Buried in the terms and conditions is that if you don't web check in and come to airport with a printed boarding pass (which is not always possible and why is something on your phone not good enough) they charge you $19USD to check in! $19 to print a piece of paper! Also charge excess baggage for only 500g about the 15kg. while letting people take 12kg in as cabin baggage! Absolutely criminal, never in all my traveling has and airline charged me for queuing up and checking in at the airport. Will never fly with them again, zero stars

### "just interested in charging"
Montería to Medellín. I travelled with a friend who had one small bag and a tiny bag and the gate staff made a whole fuss concerning the two bags. After moving the tiny bag into my own bag she finally agreed to label our bags. The plane wasn't even half full so there was no problem regarding space. She was just interested in charging 80,000 Colombian pesos. Ridiculous and pathetic attempt at charging such a small amount of stuff (for a weekend break). We were of course given seats far apart (6e and 24a) as this tactic encourages passengers to purchase seats together. Beware!

### "we are having to sit rows and seats apart"
Flew Bogota to Medellin. We booked online and we could not print off the boarding pass so we got a charge for that when we got there. We had to pay over 166,000 for a name change on one ticket because I put my wifes NZ married name and they would not accept her NZ drivers licence as proof of ID. We had a international size hand luggage bag and we still got charged for excess baggage because their size is 20% smaller than international size. For the return trip we are sending the wifes carry on bag through another company. The wife finally got the boarding passes printed off but we are having to sit rows and seats apart from each other, the staff stood on my foot while my foot was within my seat space, and the look they gave me felt like I was in their way, we were made to feel that we should be lucky to fly with them.

### "never travel this airline again"
Barranquilla to Bogota. They charged us for not checking in and printing our boarding pass. Which where I live you can always do at the airport no problem and for free! They then charged us 77 Canadian dollars for our checked bags. Absolutely ridiculous!! I would never travel this airline again.

### "The worst company ever"
Bogota to Medellin. The worst company ever what I did ever fly!! Cancelled 2 flights, no apologies at all about it from stuff on front desk. The staff doesn’t speak any English so it makes hard should o communicate with them. Really unfriendly and unhelpful staff and if I didn’t have to fly with them I would never do it. Definitely will never fly with them.

### "the worst travel experience"
Bogota to Lima. Avoid at all cost - this is by quite a margin the worst travel experience I have ever had. I am from Europe and half way in I was thinking to myself that this is even worse than Ryanair. I arrived 3 hours and 20 min before take off (with my printed e-ticket) from Kiwi and first they said I had one kilo too much luggage to check in. In fact it was 0,8kg. I then went away and took out a small something and went back.The second time they said that this e-ticket was not enough and that I needed to print a “boarding pass” but no one spoke english so it was not clear to me what they wanted. I went away to a it-place nearby and printed out a new e-ticket but apparently that was not the right one and when that happened the “3 hour deadline” had expired to they charged me 19usd for a piece of paper This is absurd and have no relation the the actual cost The people i confronted were without exception unfriendly and unhelpful For a low cost airline they are not even cheap. On a flight between Bogota and Lima with 95%+ being peruvians or colombians the in flight snack bar only accepted cash and USD.

### "worst airline I have ever travelled"
Bogotá to Cartagena. This is the worst airline I have ever travelled. Including all low costs. They put a smaller device than the allowed, so when you are about to board they make you put your luggage, and even if it's the regulated size they say they have another size. So they tell you that if you don't pay you can't board, the service is very bad. What you save on the ticket you end up paying afterwards.

### "provides the worst service "
Medellín to Cartagena. An airline that provides the worst service when you have any kind of issue with your booking. They charged 30EUR to change a passenger name which was just wrongly entered. And the worst it is that call centre & email customer service say and recommend different things. When the email service replies, it is unclear what is done or not. Overall, unfriendly people except 1 person that actually tried to help me & made clear statements.

### "charge you $10 for boarding passes"
Bogota to Lima. Extremely bad, they charge you 10$ for boarding passes. They refused to print both so I had to pay another 10$ for the connection flight. There is no reference for this during the booking process. Staff is slow, took one hour just to arrange 3 meters of barriers. They try to charge extra fees for cabin luggage that seems not to fit.

### "charged for each boarding pass"
Santa Marta to Colombia. Worst airline ever. They charged me $10 USD for each boarding pass they printed off for me at the airport. They dont allow any baggage to be checked in except if you pay and the fee is extra expensive. My aunt's ticket was also cancelled at the last minute and I have not received my refund yet.

### "worst I have experienced"
Quito to Bogota. This airline company is the worst I have experienced. They cancelled my flight in January 2017 and promised me a full refund. Now, after 6 months and many emails to/from their customer service, I have not received my money. They are trying to run me tired by playing stupid and asking me to send the same information again and again. I strongly advise not to fly with VivaColombia.

### "I had a horrible experience"
Cartagena to Medellin. After booking and paying for my ticket online I never recieved a confirmation or a receipt by email. The flight information was also wrong on the website arrival time was 11:45 pm but was written 11:45 am. There was no gate number provided either and the flight number was wrong as well. I had to come so early to the airport to recieve my receipt and yet they still charged me for a boarding pass print. With all the miscommunication and misinformations I am very unsatisfied with the service and employee and management handling the situation. And as I am writing this the flight is delayed causing even more inconveniences. I had a horrible experience with VivaColombia as many others on the flight did as well.

### "company policies are borderline"
Medellín to Lima via Bogota. VivaColombia's attitude towards customers is in sane. I have never been treated in such a rude and unfair fashion. This happened a couple of times. Of course not all employees are terrible but the line was crossed too many times plus the company policies are borderline. The money I intended to save was outweighed big time by hidden costs, unacceptable policies and expenses regarding canceled/delayed flights and negative feelings. The seats offered the most narrow space ever: if you are taller than 1,85 cm you will suffer.

### "will never fly them again"
Medellin to Bogota. VivaColombia is the worst airline I have flown and that is a reflection of their customer service, rules, and the overall experience. The people that represent this company are very rude and routinely say things like "you can visit our website if you have questions about our policies", instead of explaining it to you. They are a budget airline however in the end you pay more for an experience so bad it's actually difficult to put into words. Imagine paying for a boarding my pass unless you have a physical printout of it? They have changed the specifications of the size of luggage you are allowed to bring for carry on just so they can force you to pay for it. I have flown this airline three times and I will never fly them again.

### "no staff to give information"
Medellin to Santa Marta. Don't fly with Viva Colombia. About 3 hours delay, permitted hand luggage size is small (only a little backpack is allowed) and it's expensive to add luggage. In Medellin there was no staff to give information about the delays. No staff at San Marta. Better book LAN, it's a bit more expensive but is worth it.

### "avoid flying VivaColombia"
Quito to Bogota. It was the first time flying with Viva Colombia, December 17 2016 and It will be the last, guaranteed. It is the most ridiculous service I've encountered in all my long years as a traveler. Tried using their website to purchase the tickets, unable to get through, bought the ticket via phone, all seemed OK, only to receive an email two days later indicating the tickets already paid for have been cancelled. I'm still waiting for the refund to my CC, no explanation why. Had to buy new tickets. They will charge you for just about everything, right from printing the boarding pass ($16,00 US) to assigning seats (plane was not even half full), to a bottle of water or a snack. The flight was delayed almost one hour forcing us to miss the connection flight with another airline. The customer service at the airport, on the phone, through e-mail was just pathetic, not helpful at all. No offer of any compensation. Forced to purchase new tickets for the next day. Curious enough, while in Bucaramanga, we decided to purchase a flight ticket for a relative, and the story repeated itself again, initial purchase OK, confirmation OK, only to find out two weeks later it has been cancelled and it will be a while trying to get the refund, meanwhile, initiating a new purchase. Pleaase avoid flying with VivaColombia, the "savings" they offer, in the long run are not worth the hassle.

### "I will never fly with them again"
The flight itself was not bad, for the price I cannot fault, however the customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. I flew from bogota to Santa Marta arriving @ 8:50 when I got back to my hotel I realised I had left my passport on board. I got a taxi straight back to the airport unfortunately the plane had left. I asked one of the desk staff to make sure once the plane landed in Bogota to get one of the crew members to check my seat as I knew 100% that I left it in the pocket seat in front of mine. She told me it wasn't her responsibility and that I'd have to ring myself. I explained to her on google translate because I don't speak Spanish and pleaded with her to ring on my behalf, it was just a simple phone call for her to make but she refused and waved me away. I rang VivaColombia myself but as predicted nobody spoke English so I went back to the desk and pleaded with her to ring, she eventually agreed to get someone to check the plane once she had time. The plane went back and forth from bogota to Santa Marta 4 times, each time I asked one of the VivaColombia staff to check the plane but nobody did, at 7pm that night after spending 9 hours in the airport one of the staff eventually approached me and said they searched the plane but found no passport nor did any of the staff report that it got handed to them. I was fuming, one simple phone call when I first reported it and I believe I would have got my passport back but nobody cared one bit. Over the next few days I emailed the airline numerous times to see what they were doing to try and retrieve the passport but I kept getting generic emails back saying it is not viva Colombia's responsibility for any lost property. They did nothing to help find it. I had to get an 18 hour bus drive to bogota from Santa Marta and go to the Airport myself and check with the police, the lost and found, immigration and security and inquire myself because it wasn't VivaColombia responsibility to take five minutes out of their day to Call into the above offices which are all right next to each other in the airport, instead they emailed to come and check myself giving no consideration that I was hundreds of miles away. Unfortunately police or immigration didn't have the passport either so I had to get an emergency travel card and fly back to Ireland to try and get a new passport leaving my girlfriend behind in Colombia by herself, in total it cost me $3800 to get it all sorted. I know losing the passport was completely my own fault however I feel with just a small bit of consideration from the airline and some costumer service I would have got my passport back and all this could have been avoided. As long as I live I will never fly with them again and I urge anybody who reads this to do the same, it's all well and good when everything goes smoothly but if anything happens to go wrong you are completely on your own. Spend the extra few dollars on a more reputable company because there is a reason why they are so low cost, it's not in their budget to help customers who are in trouble

### "shouldn't be expect luxury"
Bogota to Monteria with VivaColombia. I am a foreigner living in Colombia, and I have flown about 15 times with VivaColombia (Bogota-Cali, Bogota-Cucuta, Bogota-Cartagena, Bogota-Santa Marta, Bogota-Lima, Bogota-Monteria). Since it's a low-cost airline, you shouldn't be expecting luxury. For instance, you can't check-in luggage without paying for it, same thing for food and drinks on the plane. But, most domestic flights are 30-45 minutes so who cares if you don't get a free coffee? In a nutshell, if you're a budget traveler or you want to go somewhere for a few days - then this is the best airline for you.

### "slow and unhelpful staff"
Quito to Panama via Bogota with VivaColombia. This airline is a perfect example of what happens when staff are not encouraged or allowed to think independently. Whilst dealing with a paperwork issue we waited 5 hours before seeing a representative at the airport desk. During this time we witnessed more staff members than customers casually chatting behind the desk. When we would ask for information about what was going on we would be told one thing, only to be told something different half an hour later. Communication is not this companies strong point. Honestly the flights are not bad for a low cost carrier, just be prepared for slow check ins, slow and unhelpful staff and make sure you stay within the limits for everything including paperwork into other countries and weight on baggage.

### "client service is terrible"
I would advise anyone that is thinking about using this airline to not do so. I flew Miami to Medellín round trip and it was very inexpensive. I thought it would be okay to try it, the service was terrible and the airplane uncomfortable and very hot to say the least. I flew to Colombia with an instrument, my guitar, paid a fee to take it as carry on and that's it. When returning home to Miami, the Viva Colombia Airline crew denied me taking the guitar and said I need to send it through with the bags. Of course, anyone that knows a Taylor Guitar is around $1,300 USD and it would insane to send it with a bunch of bags. I attempted to speak to the front desk staff who said no, spoke to her supervisor who did not even care or was a bit concerned about my problem. She said it was protocol to not take instruments as carry ons and that Viva Colombia in the States shouldn't have allowed me to bring it in. She apologized on behalf of their staff and just walked off. I called the person above her who was even more nonchalant about the situation, she could not have cared less. The client service is terrible. First and last time I ever fly Viva Colombia, as a Colombian it's embarrassing to know they carry our name.

### "the lowest class of airline"
Lima to Bogota, and Viva Colombia is a low cost airline like no other that I have had the misfortune of travelling with. Taxes are not included in the ticket. You pay this at the counter in cash (Dollars only). To add to insult, an eticket or boarding pass on your phone is not accepted, it needs to be printed. As expected the staff will refuse to help you with this. They rudely suggested we have an hour to pay them, find the money, or find a way to print it ourselves or not be allowed on the flight we paid for. They can print the pass for you at an extra $15. If you did not check the correct number of bags online that's an extra $15. So it comes to $30. Again, as mentioned lets not forget the taxes you need to pay in cash at the counter. So that makes it $45 extra. All in all, it then becomes the same price as flying on a national carrier. On the flight itself, it's first come first serve in terms of seating as with most low cost carriers. However, being a late night flight, one would expect the lights to be dimmed or turned off at some point, so some people could rest a little. This was not the case at anypoint, hence few were able to sleep. In terms of the Emergency exit, they only allowed one person to sit next to each one. In my humble opinion, that defeats the point of safety. If people are far away from the exit, it takes longer to escape in the unlikely event of an emergency. In terms of Emergency, at no point was their ever any briefing given by the cabin crew. I give this an overall very negative review and easily say it the lowest class of airline I've ever travelled with.

### "terrible customer service"
Bogota to Matecaña, and VivaColombia has terrible customer service. My flight was delayed then cancelled with minimal communication from staff in Spanish and zero communication in English. Eventually we were placed in multiple charter jets approximately 5 hours after our scheduled departure time. Once at our destination, our luggage did not arrive. Filled out forms and were told luggage would be delivered next day. Two days later I went back to the airport to check and my suitcase had been sitting behind the counter the whole time.

### "price of the ticket"
Medellin to Barranquilla. VivaColombia is an airline if you want travel for business or a short time. The experience on ground is not very well, the staff is not very friendly. The best of this airline is the price of the ticket. Need be more nice with the people and the internet service is confused. I dont need that, I only want to book the travel.

### "only good thing is the price"
I flew them from Bogota to Cartagena return. The airline is nothing to rave home about. The check in staff didn't speak english, the e-ticket onky had a few english words. The cabin crew and check in staff looked bored and looked like they were just waiting for their shift to end. None of them smiled. The leg room in very very small. The only good thing is the price. If you want no frills, this is a good airline.
