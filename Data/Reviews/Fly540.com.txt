### "they  still let you buy tickets"
This airline had apparently been suspended from service about a month ago (September 2022), I was told on the airport in Nairobi as well as in Lamu. They haven't informed passengers, they even still let you buy tickets and do check in online and when you show up at the airport it's only then when you realize that there is no flight of fly540. Please do not book with this airline.

### "customer service is one of the worse"
Lamu to Nairobi. Due to the coronovirus outbreak, we had to cancel our trip to Kenya and I have emailed them three times and I never got a response. On the online chat they seem not to respond at all or they are very slow and can not issue a refund. I do not know how is to fly with them but their customer service is one of the worse. The problem is that if you are one of the few companies flying between two destination you are bound to pick one of the two. Really shame that they are so useless.

### "They never replied"
Mombasa to Nairobi. Delayed 1,5 hours, so I didn´t get in the plane because I needed to be on time in Nairobi for the next flight. In the counter they gave me the email contact details so that I ask for a reimbursement. They never replied.

### "airline is never on time."
Not Verified |  Mombasa to Nairobi. This airline is never on time. Please avoid it at all costs, the delays are usually minimum 30mins and can stretch to up to 3hours. If you have an urgent engagement that is time sensitive, pick another airline to fly by.

### "Awful experience"
Eldoret to Nairobi. Horrible airline. My first flight with them was from NBO to ELD which was delayed by 4 hours!! My return flight has again been delayed by 3 hours with a silly explanation. Unless you want to be wasting your time at the airport with delays. There are better more reliable local airlines. Awful experience.

### "delay without any announcement"
Nairobi to Mombasa. Flight delayed without proper notification. Was at the airport as early as 5:30 to wait till 9pm with a child no compensation of even a soft drink. Kept saying flight departs at 8pm yet it took another 50 mins additional delay without any announcement.

### "Excellent airline"
Not Verified |  Flew Nairobi to Zanzibar with Fly540.com. Excellent airline. Flights are prompt arriving and take off is to the minute on time. Ground staff are helpful as are the cabin crew. Planes are clean and appear well maintained. Baggage arrives with the passengers. A good way to fly locally in E Africa.

### "shame on you Fly 540"
Kisumu to Nairobi. It was my first time to fly with 540. I arrived relatively early for my flight because I was travelling with a toddler. The check in Counter in Kisumu was not yet open so I had to wait almost an hour which was not a Problem. Finally I saw that the Check in was open and decided to check in. I had two 20kg bags. One for me and another for my son because he had his own seat. Shock on me when i went they told me my son has excess baggage. How was this possible when I checked and rechecked on their Website and confirmed that the allowance for him is also 20kg. Then the guy who was checking me in even confirmed with his colleague that the allowance for my child is only 10Kg. After much arguing he gave up and took my bags. Later at the waiting Lounge I Googled and confirmed that he also has 20kg like me. shame on you Fly 540. Your employees are scammers and will try to get whatever they can from customers. if they had found some inexperienced customers who dont know the rules they would have duped him. Then add to the fact that the flight had an almost 2 hour delay with no communication whatsoever from you. And no apology . Will never fly 540. Was the first time and definitely the last.

### "Avoid them at any cost"
I have never used an airline with a worse customer service, or on schedule departure than fly540, especially the managers and customer service in Juba and in Nairobi. Just today, December 25th 2017, I was scheduled to travel to Nairobi from Juba, South Sudan and got to the airport 1 hour and 45 before departure time, to be told the flight is full and the manager and check-in agent told me that my seat has been sold to another customer who was at the check-in desk before me. This is the airline that never departs on time and passengers have sit for hours (min 1.5 hours) in waiting area for the airline to arrive. I bought my ticket (round trip) 3 months in advance. fly540 is the absolute worst airline that you wished you had used their flights, airlines, come into contact with their rude and unprofessional staff. I will never use them again. Avoid them at any cost.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
Nairobi to Eldoret. This is by far the worst airline I have ever used in my life of 65 years of international travel for three reasons. The terminal managers deliberately withheld information from all passengers as to the fact that the flights were delayed, and how long the delays would be, making it impossible for the passengers to call ahead and make new arrangements for their appointments and ground transportation, just because they were embarrassed to admit the delay in the first place. The delays were very very long and endemic (1.5 hours, 1.15 hours) although the itineraries were very short (30 min., 45 min. flights) to near in-country destinations; and the "flexi plus" fare, which is higher than other tickets, was supposed to afford the ability to change reservations according to advertising without an extra charge; however, when I changed one flight by a few hours, I was charged extra for a "new reservation fee" and "new E ticket fee" and was directed to the "fine print". The terminal managers continually lied to all of the passengers about the fact of delays while, all the time, continuing to post on the monitors that the flights were "on time" even when the time had passed. They also fabricated delay estimates in 10 min intervals when pressured to tell us how long the delay would be, with very long explanations of where the plane was, why it hasn't arrived, and the fact that no one anywhere in the organization had any estimates as to the delayed departure times or whether we would ever depart. This act of deliberate rudeness enraged many passengers who vowed never to ride this airline again. There are two other airlines in Kenya to choose from, one of which has an excellent reputation and has airplanes painted like giraffes. I chose this airline because it seemed to be convenient to book online. A big mistake. You can book online with the other airlines too, and they are responsive by telephone for reservations and changes.

### "excellent little airline"
I fly Fly540 regularly between Mombasa and Nairobi and have nothing but good things to say about the product and service. The airline is a low-cost carrier operating within Kenya and to a number of points outside, such as Zanzibar and Juba. Nairobi to Mombasa is usually operated by a Canadair aircraft. I choose to fly Fly540 because it is cheaper than the other carriers on the routes I travel, the terminal they use in Nairobi is far easier to use and their punctuality has always been excellent. Check in in Nairobi is a dream as it is handled in the new Terminal which is almost always empty. Security takes around 5 minutes and then you check in, in the big open terminal. This terminal was built as a temporary structure, but I think is here to stay. After check-in there is a further security checkpoint before you enter the departure lounge. Here there is a very small premium lounge (accessible by payment or Priority Pass etc.) an a larger open boarding gate area. There is a small café selling cold and hot drinks and some basic food items but no shops. The info screens above the gate have never shown the correct flight information at any time I have flown. Staff are unfortunately very uncommunicative here which is a problem if you want to get information from them, this is not the case with the Mombasa staff who seem much more customer-friendly. Boarding is usually started about 15 mins prior to departure through one of the gates and you normally walk to your aircraft. Cabins look worn, but not dirty. There is always a complimentary beverage service (tea, coffee, water or type of soda) and a biscuit (more than you get on BA or many of the European legacy airlines, let alone low cost!). The in-flight magazine is a good read. Flights has always arrived pretty much on schedule and I have never had problems with baggage (damage or loss). An excellent little airline which performs well above it's low-cost price tag. Fly540 unfortunately do not have any form of frequent flyer reward program.

### "oblivious to their clientele"
Nairobi Wilson to Lamu, and on the day of my flight a VIP was to arrive at Nairobi Wilson Airport which translated to airport and fly540 staff scattered all over the place and oblivious to their clientele sitting at departures : no one to advise on time of departure, or worse in this case how to check in for your flight. Waiting patiently you soon learn that when flying from Wilson Airport that you must go to the fly540 offices 2 kilometres away at Langata house - a critical piece of information inconveniently left out when booking at their town offices. The rush to make a sale on account of my money and time At their officees in Langata house, they advised that it was too late to board and that for a fee I could have my ticket changed. This is where good faith in business starts to wear thin, going back and forth on why I should have read the small print that says where we should obtain our boarding passes (that's like telling someone to check the ingredients when you go to the restaurant), obtaining a ticket has still been problematic.

### "flights reasonably on time"
2 short flights Nairobi - Eldoret return, in a modern newish jet. Flights reasonably on time, and comfortable. Satisfactory ground staff and flight crew for low cost airline. Soft drink and biscuits served.

### Fly540.com customer review
Flew Fly540 from Juba to Nairobi and back. The aircraft's used were not from Fly540's own fleet but chartered. They were very old and dirty one smelt extremely bad. Thankfully nothing happened but I did not feel safe and I will not fly them again.

### Fly540.com customer review
Flew Fly540 from Zanzibar to Mombasa and Mombasa to Nairobi. Overall the service was prompt and efficient. For a "budget airline" they gave much better service than some of the other airlines we flew on in Africa.

### Fly540.com customer review
Accra to Kumasi in Ghana with Fly540Africa in February whilst on a business trip in Ghana. I have flown low cost airlines in Europe before so had pretty low expectations. However - I found that booking a flight was easy via their website and also staff were friendly and helpful. It was a short flight so no food to comment on the seats were pretty comfortable and although I am admittedly not very tall there was a comfortable amount of leg room. I would not hesitate to use Fly540 Africa again.

### Fly540.com customer review
Used Fly540.com to fly from Zanzibar to Mombasa in June 2012. Flight departed even before schedule as soon as everyone was aboard. The plane was almost empty maybe about 10-15 passengers. The arrival was also about 30 minutes earlier then expected. Plane was an older Bombardier. We were served with a bottle of drinking water upon boarding. Service was friendly. The flight was truly short and not much to comment on it. Should I need to travel within Africa once again I'll take Fly540 without hesitation.

### Fly540.com customer review
I flew with fly540 from to Nairobi to Eldoret and back to Nairobi and the service was great. From the flight to the cabin crew. Highly recommended. Timing for departure and arrival to the minute.

Flew Nairobi - Mombasa on September 2nd 2012. Supposed to leave at 12h eventually left at 15h when new plane from Mogadishu Somalia arrived to take us to our destination. The scheduled plane was damaged so badly it couldn't be repaired in time. Weren't clearly notified of the delay half an hour after the scheduled boarding time a woman told us there was a two hour delay 'at least' but nothing over the microphone on the speakers we had to tell the others. Later on new information was only given when asked they didn't take any initiative. Did all get two free sandwiches and a drink of choice though with a value of about 500 shillings which isn't too bad considering the flight cost about 2500 shillings each. Flight itself was okay bit bumpy but could be due to the borrowed old F28-4000 flight attendants were nice the cookies are disgusting but the free water on board is nice. In the end I'm glad my layover on Mombasa was 7 hours and the delay didn't make me miss my flight.

Zanzibar to Nairobi with a stopover at Mombasa (with immigration). All in all a good flight. No delays and we even got our luggage when we arrived. I cannot figure out why they get so poor reviews. During the flight we got orange juice water and biscuits (do you expect to get anything from a budget airline). The only strange thing was the hand-written boarding cards but that's just another dimension to the African experience.

### Fly540.com customer review
MBA-WIL and NBO-MBA. Old Dash 8-100 on both flights with limited comfort - but okay for the 1 hr flight. Service on both legs consisted of 2 dry biscuits and cold drinks. Crew okay but disappeared immediately after servicing the few passengers. Return flight was delayed 4 hrs with nearly no information.

### Fly540.com customer review
Very basic airline with basic equipment on all levels. A bit expensive but they fly routes that few other airlines fly. Reliability is a serious problem with them and they give little consideration to your time. They will just call you and say that your flight is cancelled and then you have to spend an extra night at your destination. If they don't have your number good luck.

### Fly540.com customer review
Nairobi-Kitale and return. both flights were on time plane noisy but comfortable cabin staff helpful. Costs reasonable. Would recommend and will use again.

### Fly540.com customer review
Nairobi to Malindi and Malindi to Lamu (both returns). We found them to be quite efficient and helpful for an African airline. They did however cancel our return flight from Lamu but did send out a search party to find us on the island for us to catch an alternative/earlier flight. Timings were good with no delays in fact one flight left 40 mins early. I would have no hesitation in recommending Fly540 based on our experience. Aircraft a bit old but clean.

### Fly540.com customer review
We had some flights with fly540. First van Kampale to Nairobi and later from Nairobi to Mombasa and back. The planes are not new but safe. The prices for these trips was much lower than other airlines. Normally they fly on time but the last flight from Mombasa to Nairobi they cancelled the flight (normally 5 times a day). I had a meeting in Nairobi so I asked for a solution. They arranged for us on another flight by another airline.

### Fly540.com customer review
My wife & I backpacked Kenya Uganda Tanzania over a few months. Used Fly540 twice - Kampala to Zanzibar (via NBO) and it was perfect. The price on land service inflight service punctuality could not be faulted. At the end of our trip we flew from Lamu (wonderful to relax there are 3 months backpacking) to NBO via Malindi. Same thing - saved us some 20 hours in a bus on time good service all round. The airline is part owned by Lonhro - a large corporate.

I was on a flight with them from Kilimanjaro to Zanzibar via Dar es Salaam. Operated by a small 20 seater but no complaints. Especially in the front there was enough room. Flight was delayed by one hour but I guess thats was happens in Africa. Tickets could easily be booked online and we confirmed them again in their office in Arusha. Baggage limit is 20kg but although both of us had 25kg each we could pass without paying more. Would definitely go with them again.

### Fly540.com customer review
We had a ticket to fly DAR-ZNZ but on arrival to DAR from NBO a member of the staff was waiting for us to inform us that the flight had been delayed - so much that they were putting us on another flight operated by a competitor. So we never got to fly with them but we were quite impressed at how they had arranged everything for us. The agent stayed with us at the gate until we departed. I thought it was great service.

### Fly540.com customer review
NBO-MBA. ATR-42 not exactly new but well kept. Courteous inflight staff - genuine smiles. Some refreshment option of coffee or soda and poorly packed 4 biscuits. Overall experience okay and suitable for the no frills traveller especially for short haul. Always compare prices though because they are at times higher than those for the national carrier which operate bigger and much faster shuttles on the same route.

### Fly540.com customer review
Flight from Mombasa to Nairobi was delayed by 2 hours - these things happen. plane was good service excellent - nice sandwich a few biscuits and 2 beers. Many 'top-end' airlines cant match that!

### Fly540.com customer review
Fly540 service is dreadful. The DMC I work for had booked seats for four customers on its service arriving into Kichwa Tembo airstrip in the Masai Mara scheduled to land at around 1030hrs. We were told by the airline to be at the airstrip at 1000hrs to collect our clients. At 1230hrs the aircraft still had not arrived and we were told that it had only just left Nairobi. At 1445hrs there was still no sign of the aircraft and Operations were no longer answering our calls. We finally got through to be told the aircraft would be landing at 1530hrs. Needless to say at 1530hrs there was still no sign of the aircraft and no explanation forthcoming from 540 as to how a flight that takes on average 30-40 minutes from Nairobi to the Mara could have taken more than three hours. Only a week prior to this incident we had customers travelling back from the Mara to Nairobi and 540 told us to be at the airstrip at 1100hrs. We arrived at the airstrip on time only to be told by those already there that the flight had landed ten minutes early and departed within five minutes without even waiting for our clients or calling the lodge to find out where they were (which all the other airlines do). As a result our clients' itineraries were completely disrupted and we were forced to provide another night for them at the lodge at our own expense as none of the other airlines could accommodate them.

### Fly540.com customer review
The equipment 540 fly (DHC-8s and ATRs) are good-quality and reliable. Unfortunately the equipment is the only thing those epithets apply to. I run a luxury camp in the Masai Mara and have been let down on countless occasions by Fly540 either not turning up at the time they request passengers to be at the airstrip or not turning up at all! On the last occasion I had a travel editor from a large US news corporation and the chairman of a nationwide tourist board travelling and we ended up waiting five hours for a service which we were then told would not be stopping at the destination my guests were going to. When I emailed 540 to advise them of their unreliability and that fact that I would henceforth be using a competitor airline and would not be recommending their services the response I received (via email) was: "ok no problem" which I think speaks volumes to their attitude towards their customers.

### Fly540.com customer review
The planes are basic ATR and service is good. It is cheaper way of flying when connecting cities like Entebbe Mombasa Nairobi etc. Recommended for a frequent traveller who wants to budget his expenses. It is a low cost airline.
