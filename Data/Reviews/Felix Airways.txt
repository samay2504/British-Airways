### Felix Airways customer review
It was my first time in Yemen and flying Felix Airways. The flight was only 25 min, but it was enjoyable. The staff were friendly and the plane was in a good shape, in addition to a comfortable seat and a nice route.

### Felix Airways customer review
Sharjah via Mukhalla to Socotra and back onboard nearly full Yemeni Bombardier CRJ200 plane. Check in at Sharjah was a bit chaotic due to much luggage boarding the plane was guided by the station manager personally in Sharjah as there wasn't any seat allocation. They have an inflight magazine. During the 2-hour flight to RIY a snack was served. Crew very nice; on the return flight leaving SCT the captain even explained everything what was visible from the windows. The plane was in a good shape at least what was visible - clean and tidy.
