### "Don’t fly Tame"
Not Verified |  Quito to Coca. Canceled flight without prior notice, we arrived at the airport and flight was canceled. Second Time on 2 weeks. Don’t fly Tame, I heard also from other customers similar experiences

### "fly with another carrier"
Not Verified |  We left Ft. Lauderdale this past December to travel to Guayaquil for a visit with family and friends. The flight was normal as we have traveled this route numerous times. When we arrived in Guayaquil; our 12 bags of luggage were not there. After standing in a "lost and found" line with TAME for about an hour, it was explained to us that approx 200 pieces of luggage had been left in Ft. Lauderdale. Their attitude was: this happens--deal with it. When I explained that this would require us to buy new clothes, toiletries, and other items -- they offered no compensation even though I asked for it. We arrived in Ecuador on Friday - the luggage would be delivered to the airport in Guayaquil late Sunday afternoon. The airport in Guayaquil is over 3.5 hours away from where were staying in Ecuador, which equates to almost 8 hours to retrieve luggage that should have been there when we landed. They did offer to send it to the Manta airport which is much closer, but it would not be there until late Monday. We did finally receive our luggage, again no apologies as this seemed to be normal to the TAME employees. The same experience happened to another relative who arrived 5 days later - he had to wait a few days to get his luggage after arriving. The "new" normal for TAME will not be my experience again. We will fly with another carrier.

### "learn the lesson to never fly with Tame"
Quito to Manta. My Wife and I were going to go from Florida to Quito on another airline, and we booked our flights with Tame from Quito to Manta and back to Quito. We had something happen in our personal lives and had to cancel our trip. The biggest issue we had was with Tame. The tickets are 100% non-refundable, and you can't get any credit. We are having an emergency right now and we're just looking to reschedule our trip another time when we can sit and think about planning the dates. Since we can't get a credit, we're forced to pay a fee ($30+ per person) and also immediately choose other dates NOW, which as I said, is not convenient for us at the moment. The only other option is to just lose all the money we paid. They told us we can choose the new dates up to one year after our original flight dates. We settled on dates in June 2020 and called back to reschedule. Then they told us we only have until the date of PURCHASE (May 15th), not the date of our original flight. So we had to hang up and rethink all the dates again. We called back again, then they said "the system" won't let us fly that week, we have to fly before May 5th. We don't want to fly at that time, so we call again later after we picked new dates for the third time, in Nov 2019. We call back to reschedule to Nov and now they say we have to pay an additional $110+ in addition to the $250 that we already paid for the first flight. We are looking online and the ticket prices are cheaper than what we originally paid, so why are we having to pay extra, on top of the $30+ per person fees? They can't explain it. So we're being forced to pick dates NOW, which we are not really ready to do, to pick dates we don't want, because they just won't allow us to fly next June, and pay $360+ total for these dates. We decided to just lose everything we paid and learn the lesson to never fly with Tame. We're going to pick the dates we wanted in June 2020, and pay full price with Copa or Avianca instead of dealing with Tame anymore. We also will be be letting all our family still living in Ecuador of our issues with Tame. We fly our parents from Manta to Florida several times a year for the last 5 years, so I hope they enjoy the $250 they got from us, because that is the last.

### "Worst airline ever"
New York to Lima via Quito. Worst airline ever, stay away. Luggage won’t arrive to destination. I arrived to Lima on December 21 2018 had to pick up luggage on the 22nd and stayed at the airport 5 hours to get my luggage. They are very disorganized. After those 5 hours one of my luggage was missing. After 3 days had to go back to pick up my missing luggage.

### "no contact and no money"
Not Verified |  In January 2018 Tame canceled our flight from Quito to Lago Agrio with short notice. They offered us a flight 24 hours later which did not suit our itinerary into the rain forest. Tame was notified about this. In order to repay we had to send copies of payment with credit card, copy of credit card, copy of passport, copies of tickets, etc! We did this twice electronically and once with surface post. Since this was done, no contact with the airline and no money. Be careful!

### "The worst airline ever"
Galapagos to Quito. The worst airline ever. We had to pay $300 more for the ticket at Galapagos because we were not a Ecuadorian citizen. All the international travelers had to pay extra. The police were involved but they didn't do anything. Customers service is terrible and nobody wants to talk to you in English.

### "Would avoid if you can"
Cuenca to Quito. Second flight cancelled in the space of a week after checking in at the airport. First one resulted in a 3 hour delay after re-routing from Guyaquil to Cuenca via Quito. This one is an 8 hour delay, leaving us no choice but to remain in Cuenca airport. Just an 8-dollar lunch voucher offered as compensation. Staff were friendly but information given was haphazard. Seats on other flights have been old and ragged, food very poor. Would avoid if you can find another carrier.

### "crew polite and helpful"
Quito to Galápagos Islands and return to Guayaquil. First leg UIO-GPS was with a stop in GYE to collect more passengers there was an hour delay announcements were made only in Spanish but when I asked I was informed anyway. A short hop to GYE and short stop there and then 2 hrs to GPS both legs were on an older version of A320 no inflight entertainment but I wasn’t expecting as it’s domestic and not really long flights besides I was enjoying the scenery from the window. Their inflight magazine is also only in Spanish which is strange being an Int’l airline and a lot of tourists come to visit. Ground staff in both UIO and GPS were very helpful and cheerful and when I asked for seats with extra leg room I was offered first seat in Economy on both flights. Crew on board doing their jobs but weren’t very enthusiastic but polite and helpful. A sandwich and a coffee were offered which was a sufficient snack. Crew constantly talk to me in Spanish, a language that I don’t speak. Return flight to GYE was on time and arrived on time to catch my Int’l connection to AMS. Luggage was delivered quickly and no hassle for connecting from domestic to Int’l at GYE even if it’s with a different airline. I was really surprised with the good service all in all and worth what I paid. Just planes are old and need renovation. Toilets were kept clean all the time. Will recommend it for future if I go to Ecuador again.

### "all went wrong"
Guayaquil to Quito. Well all went wrong. 3 hours late, a short fly of 30 minutes. Anarchic system, my seat is occupied, changed 3 times in the plane. Pre-boarding all at the same time.

### "seats are old and dirty"
New York to Guayaquil with Tame. They only have one plane for this route. The same plane you take going is the same one that returns every day. The seats are old and dirty. Some have tears on the seat cushions. When you sit on them you feel the frame hitting your back. It looks decent on the outside but the inside is poor. The entertainment system does not work. They did not serve food for 3 hrs. We had taken food for our 7 year old daughter but did not bring a fork. when I asked for a fork I was told they could not give me one because it would render another passengers tray incomplete. All the trays were accounted for already and they had the exact number for all. The flight attendants are not very friendly. You are better off taking LAN. You get what you pay for.

### "awful experience"
The TAME flight had a cancellation, and departed late from JFK. They announced that were sending us to a hotel at Quito since we were losing the connection, they rejected to stay in NYC instead? When we arrived to Quito, after having 9 hours to arrange our stay, they sent us to a small hotel without confirming to the hotel. Therefore, we did not fit all, the hotel was very humble, and were not prepared to give us dinner. There were no supervisor responsible and nobody to talk with. Awful experience.

### "service almost non-existent"
New York JFK to Quito. My grandson and I upgraded at JFK to business class for $200 per person. We got next to nothing for the extra money. The seats were very comfortable and the cabin spacious. But service was almost non-existent. We were served the same breakfast as in coach in the same plastic containers with the same plastic utensils. And that was it, there was no follow up service with coffee, juice, etc, let alone alcohol. There was also no inflight entertainment. Our bags were tagged as priority, but were almost the last on the carousel at Quito,
